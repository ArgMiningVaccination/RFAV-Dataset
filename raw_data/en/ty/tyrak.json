Training to competency in communication skills is increasingly required for clinicians at all levels of training. The medical interview is the most common procedure that clinicians will perform -\u00ad numbering more that 150,000 scheduled interviews for a typical ca reer, and add itional countless telephone calls and unscheduled interviews with hospitalized patients and family members. In a busy practice, improving communication is often regarded as a luxury, and many clinicia ns believe that good communicators a re \"born not made.\" In reality, communication skills must be learned, practiced, and maintained. (1-\u00ad3) Key clinica l outcomes related to communication skills include greater patient and clinician satisfaction, greater patient understanding and acceptance of treatment plans, reduced patient distress, and fewer lawsuits. (4-\u00ad7 ) Interventions to improve clinician-\u00adpatient communica tion ca n lead to improved biomedical outcomes such as better self -\u00ad management of diabetes, reduced postoperative morbidity, and better coping and quality of life in cancer. (8-\u00ad10 ) One wa y that communication skills af fect outcomes is by determining the accuracy and completeness of the data available to generate hypotheses about the disease and the patient. (11 ) Communication also f orms the basis for a therapeutic alliance, based on mutual trust, respect, and understanding of each other's ideas, f eelings, and values. (12) The success of this alliance predicts patients' understanding of their conditions, adherence with treatment pla ns, and relief of pain and distress. The skills include identif ying and removing barriers to communication (physical, psychological, social, cultural), surveying the patient' s concerns and negotiating a consensual agenda for the visit. (Do cCom module 7) The patient's uninterrupted opening statement will help you decide how actively you will need to guide the flow of information. Creating a shared agenda helps keep both of you \"on track\" during the encounter and rewards patients f or taking an active role in their care. (14) Evidence shows that using these skills, and the skill of making explicit empathic and caring statements (DocCo m module 6) saves time.(2 ,14-\u00ad16 ) Finding the right balance between patients' narrative and clinicia ns' diagnostic inquiry is a never-\u00ad ending \"dance.\" Most interviews move back and forth between narrartive and inquiry to create a common language and understanding of the problem. (17,18 ) In addition to being immensely satisfying, the dance establishes trust and respect and promotes willingness to share the tasks of care. (19 ) It also makes the processes of giving information (Do cCom module 10), negotia ting a plan of care (DocCom module 11), enlisting the patient's active participa tion and planning f ollow-\u00ad up more effective and efficient. The form a nd function of the dance are addressed more fully in the module on \"Structure and content of the interview.\" (DocCom module 5) Questio ns fo r Reflect ion: What does the term \"communication skills\" mean to you? You have been communicating and practicing communica ting all your life. What special skills can you imagine learning, and how will you learn them? In thinking about an experience you have had with a clinician when you or a family member were a patient, how did the clinician' s communication skills af fect your sense of trust, allay your concerns, help you understand your illness, engender hope? Wha t specif ic skills did your clinician use to enhance or inhibit communication? Were you able to say all that you wanted? Why or why not? How motivated are you to learn the skills that will ma ke you more masterful in clinician-\u00ad patient communication? Key Principles: Effective communication requires a set of core skills that underlie every aspect of clinica l care. Better communication skills produce better health care outcomes. Communication skills can be taught, learned, maintained, and enhanced. In order to improve your communication skills, you need motivation, self-\u00ada wareness, a specif ic focus and self-\u00adcare. Learning go als: At completion of this module, learners will be able to: Describe the importance of self -\u00adawareness in effective communication. Describe 7 essentia l elements of clinical communication. Describe 8 evidence-\u00adbased outcomes linked to clinician communication. Describe 4 common deficiencies in clinicia n communica tion skills. Describe 4 features of effective teaching of communication skills. INTRODUCTION DocCom meets the needs of trainees, clinicia ns, and accrediting and licensing bodies f or educa tion and proficiency in healthcare communications. The past few decades are marked by a growing attention to clinician interpersonal and communication skills. Clinicians are re-\u00addiscovering that their patient relationships are a ma jor source of personal and professiona l satisfaction. Patients are asserting their desire f or better communication with their clinicians. Researchers are establishing links between clinician communication behaviors and vital health care outcomes. Some health care organiza tions a re changing their policies a nd procedures in response to these changes. (20 ) At the same time, medical educators have noted that students' communication skills are eroded or \"unlearned\" during their training. (21 ) Most medical schools teach the ba sic skills, but many lack the resources, methods, or faculty training necessary f or effective teaching in this domain. (22 ) In 1999, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) ca lled for greater teaching ofcommunication skills (23 ), and in 2003 the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Educa tion (ACGME) called for competency-\u00adbased teaching a nd assessment, including \"interpersonal and communication skills\" as a core clinical competency required f or successf ul completion of residency training. (24) The American B oard of Medical Specialties (AB MS) adopted the same competencies for re-\u00adcertif ication. American Academy o n Communicatio n in Healthcare: DocCom The American Aca demy on Communication in Hea lthcare (AACH) is an organization of clinicians and others interested in supporting and advancing education and research on communication, clinica l relationships and rela ted psychosocial skills. The Acad emy's courses integrate lectures and readings with hands-\u00adon, small-\u00adgroup skills practice, peer observation a nd feedback, and opportunities to reflect, discuss, and integra te these experiences into our personal and professional lives. This Do cCom program, developed by AACH with support from the Arthur Vining D avis Foundations and D rexel University College of Medicine, is designed to help learners and c linicians improve their communication skills. DocCo m uses short didactic presentations and video demonstrations with commentary to illustra te importa nt facts and skills. It also includes modules on self-\u00adawareness and self-\u00adcare. Each module includes learning goa ls, key principles, questions for reflection, text and videos, and a behavior checklist. Learners can follow hyperlinks to references and resou rces. Web-\u00ad based features enhance learners' experience, including the ability to chat live with others around the country using this resource, threaded discussion groups, and more. The modules are authored by experienced and respected medical educators, many of them AACH members. COMMUNICATION SKILLS AND THE STRUCTURE OF DocCom Skills are specif ic behaviors or tasks than can be reproduced at will. Clini cal communication utilizes a set of skills def ined from research, expert opinion, and consensus. Educators have organized the skills into conceptual models that aid recall, application, and assessment. Certif iers are also concerned with measuring skills and setting standards. This Do cCom resource addresses f ive broad categories of communication skills: 1. Basic principles (5 modules) 2. Essent ial element s (7 modules), 3. Advanced elements (7 modules) 4. Specific situatio ns (17 modules) 5. Communicat ing with colleagues (6 modules) Basic Principles The 5 B asic Principles modules emphasize the critical role of self-\u00adawareness and self-\u00adcare in effective communication. Module 2 on \"Int egrating Self-\u00adReflect ion and Self-\u00adAwareness\" discusses monitoring the relationship in real time, a djusting communication and interpersonal skills as necessary.

Click here to see a short video about the rationa le for this module Module 4 o n \"Balance and Self-\u00adCare\" addresses wa ys to refresh and maintain self-\u00adawareness skills, a nd to balance personal and professiona l identities. Click here to see a short video about the rationa le for this module Module 5 gives an o verview o f skills t hat are relevant to accomplish the 3 essent ial funct ions of every interview, building a relationship, g athering information and pa tient education, a nd the interview's seven \"essentia l elements\" (see below). Click here to see a short video about the rationa le for this module Module 5 emphasizes that the flow of an interview may bear little resemblance to its final written structure. The authors note that integration of the so-\u00adcalled \"doctor-\u00adcentered\" elements with the \"patient-\u00adcentered\" elements of communication in the daily work of medical care is a challenge for all clinicians. The skills of self-\u00adawareness and sel f-\u00adcare explored in the initial 5 modules promote our ability to listen, understand, explain, a nd \"be with\" others with minimal interference from our assumptions, expectations, and biases. (26 ). For example: Awareness of your own emotions ca n be a useful diagnostic tool (DocCom modules 6, 13) Awareness of hidden assumptions (\"hot buttons\" and \"blind spots\") ca n help you build respect and trust with patients from various backgrounds, belief s, and behaviors (DocCom modules 15, 18, 19) Awareness of your strengths and weaknesses in a group setting ca n help you listen and respond more ef fectively with fa promotes interpersonal skills, or the ef fect of communication on another person.(Do cCom module 2) Interpersonal skills are inherently relational and process-\u00ad oriented. Examples of interpersonal skills include demonstrating caring and curiosity about patients' ideas and values, and use of multiple sensory channels including intuition. (DocCom module 14) Essential Elements The Ka lamazoo Consensus Statement def ined the essential elements of medicalcommunication In 1999, teachers, resea rchers, a nd evaluators from medical schools and prof essional organizations attended an invitational conference on communication teaching, assessment, and evaluation. A major topic wa s delinea ting a set of teachable and learnable essential elements in clinician-\u00adpatient communica tion. The conference included architects and representatives of 5 current models of doctor-\u00adpa tient com munication, so they reviewed these models, their evidence base, and their applications. Ultimately they identified 7 essential elements of 25) 1) Build the relat ionship (module 6) Click here to see Julian B ird giving the ra tionale f or this module 2) Opening the discussio n (mo dule 7) Click here to see Ron Saizow giving the rationa le for this module 3) Gathering info rmatio n (mo dule 8) Click here to see B eth Lown giving the rationale f or this module 4) Understanding the patient's perspect ive (mo dule 9) Click here to see B eth Lown giving the rationale f or this module 5) Sharing info rmat ion (mo dule 10) Click here to see B eth Lown giving the rationale f or this module 6) Reaching agreement o n pro blems and plans (module 11) Click here to see B eth Lown giving the rationale f or this module7) Providing clo sure (module 12) Click here to see B eth Lown giving the rationale f or this module Since its publication in 2001, the \"Essentia l Elements\" paper f rom this group has been widely used and cited. The concepts and idea s represent the collaboration and consensus of individuals f rom a variety of backgrounds in medical education. They also provide tangible examples of evidence-\u00ad based skills that help teach and assess communication comp etency in a variety of clinica l settings. Advanced Element s The 7 Advanced Element s modules contain practical information a nd skills that build on related Essential Elements. The Advanced Elements modules speak to common communication challenges that may require specif ic knowledge a nd the use of advanced adaptations of the Essent ial Elements skills in order to best serve patients. For example, this section includes modules on \"Non-\u00adVerbal Behavior\" (DocCo m module 14) and \"Responding to Strong Emotions\" (module 13), an extension of the skills discussed in the \"Build a Relationship\" module of the Essential Elements (module 6). \"Non-\u00adVerbal Behavio r\" (module 14) Click here to see Cecile Carson giving the rationale f or this module \"Respo nding to Stro ng Emo tions\" (module 13) Click here to see B arry Egener giving the ra tionale f or this module This section a lso contains modules on sexual (module 18), spiritual (module 19) and cultural issues (module 15) in communication that help us extend ourselves beyond the skills discussed in the Essential Elements modules of \"Gather Inf ormation\" (module Perspective.\" (module 9)\"Asking about Sexuality\" (mo dule 18) Click here to see Rich Frankel giving the rationale for this module \"Explo ring Spirituality and Religio us Beliefs\" (mo dule 19) Click here to see Shimon Waldf ogel giving the rationale for this module \"Cultural Issues in t he Int erview\" (module 15) Click here to see Calvin Chou giving the rationale for this module This section concludes with modules on \"Informed Decision Making\" (module 17) a nd Adherence\" (module 16). \"Info rmed Decisio n Making\" (mo dule 17) Click here to see Clarence Braddock giving the rationale for this module \"Promoting Behavior Change and Adherence\" (mo dule 16) Click here to see Micha el Goldstein giving the rationale for this module These modules present ideas and skills tha t increase our ability to address the complex everyday challenges of behavior change, enlarging on the skills outlined in the \"Share Information\" (module 10) a nd \"Reach Agreement\" (module 11) modules of the Essential Element s. Special Situat ions This section of DocCom conta ins 17 modules describing communication skills f or specific situations. These skills are used in addition to, rather than instead of, the Essential a nd Advanced Elements skills. The modules begin with a developmental approach:Family (module 20) Pediatric (module 21) Adolescent (module 22) Geriatric Interviews (module 23) and proceed to changing specific behaviors Smoking Cessa tion (module 24) Diet/Exercise (module 25) managing psychiatric and psychosocial disorders Anxiety/Panic D isorder (module 26) Depression (module 27) Domestic Violence (module 28) Alcoholism (module 29) Substance Abuse (module 29) Somatization (module 31) and end of life care Advance D irectives (module 32) Giving Bad News (module 33) Termina l Care (module 34) The section ends with modules on D iscussing Medical Error (module 35) a nd Terminating the Doctor-\u00adPatient Relationship (module 36). Communicating with Co lleagues This section of DocCom conta ins 6 modules on communicating with other health care providers. The modules include The Ora l Presentation (see DocCom module 37) Communication within Hea lth Care Teams (see module 38) Talking with Impaired Colleagues (see module 39) Principles of Teaching Medical Students and Residents (see module 40) Professionalism: B oundary Issues (see module 41) Effective Clinical Tea ching (see module 42) COMMUNICATION SKILLS MATTER Evidence f or the impact of communication skills on crucial clinica l outcomes continues to grow. The evidence that supports the urgency of consciously using skills discussed in D ocCom is referenced in each module. The type and strength of the evidence varies with the specif ic skills and outcomes measured. Much of this evidence is b ased in three types of research: correlation (coded interview va riables correlated with outcomes); observation (events or observations correlated with outcomes); and intervention (subjects receive a n intervention and outcomes are measured). For example, patient satisfaction with a visit correlates with clinician information-\u00ad giving. (27 ) Clinicians with fewer malpractice suits were more likely to ask their patients' opinionsand to check their understanding of the treatment plan. (7 ) Patients of clinicians with 8 hours of training in emotion-\u00adhandling skills reported reduction in emotional distress 6 months later. (2) The evidence linking communication skills to outcomes is summarized in a number of review articles and textbooks. (28-\u00ad30 ) Patient outcomes f ound to correlate with good clinician co mmunicat ion skills (and representative references): 1) Grea ter satisfaction with the encounter (27) 2) Improved psychological distress a nd coping (10 ) 3) Improved physical symptoms (6 ) 4) Greater recall and adherence (31 ) 5) Positive health behavior change (33) 6) Improved biologic markers (in some diseases) (8 ,33) 7) Reduced length of hospital stay (9 ) Patient outcomes f ound to correlate with po orer clinician co mmunicat ion skills: 1) Greater disenrollment f rom care (34 ) 2) More malpractice suits (7,35) Clinician outcomes found to correlate with go od clinician communicat ion skills: 1) More information available for treatment planning (36 ) 2) Fewer late arising concerns, such as \"Oh by the way\" items a t end of visit (15 ) 3) Grea ter satisfaction with the encounter (5) 4) Grea ter comfort discussing sensitive issues (37 ) DEFICIENCIES IN CLINICIAN PERFORMANCE Good communication doesn' t just happen. Experience alone is a poor teacher, unless it is coupled with observation and coaching with feedback. Communication deficiencies abound in practice. The major ones are listed below, with relevant references: 1. We interrupt patients in the earliest phases of the encounter. (16,38) 2. We fail to identify a nd prioritize patient concerns. (16 ,39) 3. We miss opportunities to understand and acknowledge patients' ideas and feelings. (37 ,41) 4. We fail to understand the importance of culture and ethnicity in health care. (41 ) 5. We do not give bad news concisely and compassionately. (42) 6. We minimize patients' roles in their care. (43 ,44) 7. We underestimate patients' health literacy. (45) 8. We don't negotia te differences well with patients. (46 ,47) 9. We fail to obtain adequate informed consent.(48 ) CAN COMMUNICATION SKILLS BE TAUGHT AND LEARNED? Yes, communica tion skills can be taught and learned with a ppropriate tea ching methods, and maintained with periodic reinf orcement.Maguire' s landmark study of medical students demonstra ted that communication skills training with video feedback led to stronger listening, clarif ication, and inquiry skills f ive years later. (49) More recently the Macy Initiative in Hea lth Communications showed improvement in students' overall competence in communication, as well as skills in relationship-\u00adbuilding, patient assessment, negotiation, and shared decision-\u00admaking. (1 ,50) Postgraduate communication skills training is less well studied. (51-\u00ad59 ) Continuing education programs in communication skills demonstrate an impact on clinician beha vior. (2,3,60-\u00ad62 ). The evidence that clinicia n communication skills training impacts behavior (63) and outcomes (64) was recently reviewed, and the evidence was used to develop comprehensive, consensus-\u00adbased approach to teaching. (65) Two articles and a book chapter on assessing communication skills have a lso been published. (66-\u00ad68 ) Many of the issues presented in DocCom are also discussed in a short, concise text, the Field Guide to the Difficult Patient Encounter, which has received positive reviews in medical journa ls. (69) Additional teaching and assessment tools can be f ound in the Outcomes Project area of the ACGME website at www.acgme.org . Effect ive teaching metho ds Evidence demonstrates tha t specif ic teaching strategies improve communication skills. Effective teaching methods include the f ollowing: 1. Exploration with learners of the evidence base and rationa le for using particular skills. 2. Presentation of a cogent conceptual model to help learners understand, organize, recall, and apply skills. 3. Hands-\u00adon, small group practice with observation and feedback. 4. Opportunities to reflect on experience as a clinician and learner. 5. Periodic reinforcement and deepening of skills over time. A description or demonstration of skills is needed to give students a sense of what the skill should \"look like.\" Hands-\u00adon practice in small groups with observation, feedback, and repetition after feedback are important next steps. Feedback is more eff ective when coupled with videotape review or \"debriefing\" with the patient. With a little e xperience, learners ca n begin setting and pursuing individua l learning goa ls based on their interests, feedback, or predetermined curricular goals. Reflection is best done in groups, where faculty ca n model and facilitate listening, explaining, and empathy skills. Ref lection can be deepened with personal journaling. These activities promote learning skills of self -\u00adreflection and self-\u00ada wareness. A variety of ef fective teaching methods exist (e.g., role play, video review, simulated patients) but none of these has consistently been shown to be superior to others. The proper timing, and \"dose-\u00ad response\" properties of this teaching are unclear but involve severa l initial sessions followed by regular revisiting a nd deepening of skills. A number of excellent texts on communication skills are now ava ilable for a variety of audiences. Beco ming a Lifelo ng Learner Medical practice is changing rapidly, a nd the content and process of communication is changing with it. Communication, like any medical procedure, requires constant revision and updating of skills. Information technology, electronic communication, collegial and interdisciplinary communication, patient safety/error disclosure, and defining the no tion of professionalism and its relationship tocommunication are only a few of the areas on the communication skills horizon. Fundamental skills to communicate compassion and empathy have a timeless and cross-\u00adcultural application, and nevertheless must be f ine-\u00adtuned to a djust to new developments in technology (organ transplants or HIV or chemotherapy treatments) and changing values in society (such as death with dignity, HIPPA regulations). Health care organizations, malpractice carriers, and professional societies already offer or endorse comm unication skills training for practicing clinicia ns. Professional societies publish articles on communication and the clinician-\u00adpatient relationship in their journals, and offer communication skills training during national meetings or special sessions. Finally, organizations such a s American Academy on Clinician and Patient, the Society f or Teachers of Family Medicine, and others provide opportunitie s for regular enhancement of communication and interpersonal skills. The network of clinicians and educators committed to improving communication skills and the clinician-\u00adpatient relationship, f or themselves personally a nd for the medical profession is growing. CONCLUSION The evidence for the positive impact of excellent communication skills on key clinical outcomes continues to grow. However, improvin g the communications skills set is often discounted a s an unaff ordable extra (\"our priority must be to focus on learning more about disea ses and how we can trea t them\"), oversimplified as a personality trait (\"good bedside manner\") or dismissed as etiquette (\"being nice\"). Communication skills can be taught, learned and retained with appropriate educational methods. Educators emphasize that this is a challenging topic to teach and learn, beca use it requires us to examine our assumptions, f eelings, and values regarding our selves, our patients, and our work. We believe you will learn much from the fa culty who have contributed to Do cCom, and will discover new freedom of expression, levels of meaning, sa tisfaction and enjoyment in your clinica l work as you ma ster the many skills of clinician-\u00adpatient communication.

Epst ein, MD Editors: Dennis Novack 4.0) 1.0 nale This module examines specific communica tion skills that promote mindful awareness, a key to effective clinical practice. Mindfulness can a lso be applied to the acquisition of skills and knowledge, cultivation of caring and healing a ttitudes, and facing the anxiety of uncertainty. Questio ns fo r Reflect ion: 1. How do others perceive you? What is it like to be with you? What impression do you leave after meeting someone for the first time? 2. When you are alone, what do you tend to notice a bout yourself? What do you tend to notice about others? What tends to escape your awareness? When you are with others, how do you listen? D o you often judge people? 3. Do you listen to others' underlying commitments, their hopes, their caring and generosity? How do you express compassion? What happens when you a re tired, multitasking, overwhelmed or distra cted? 4. Think about the most recent day you spent seeing patients (go to next question if you are not in a position to see patients), a nd identify a patient that made a strong impression on you. Perhaps you f elt anxiety, concern, anger or sadness. D id the situation pique your curiosity? Or did you just want to avoid it? What did you notice about your reaction? Was it a habitual reaction? Was it an intentio nal and attentive response? How do you think that reaction may have influenced the way you communicated with the patient? Your medical decisions? The likelihood that the patient would return to see you? 5. If you have not had clinica l experience, consider a kind of person who might trigger strong responses in you. Perhaps they might remind you of friends or family members, or even yourself. Or perhaps they are people unlike any whom you have previously met. How do you think that your reaction might influence your communica tion with patients who resemble in some way that person? Your medical decisions ? Your interest or commitment to caring for patients who resemble that person in some way? 6. Think of recent learning experiences related to communication and relationship, and identify one tha t stands out in your memory. How do you think that response might influence the way you continue to learn about communica tion skills a nd clinicia n-\u00adpatient instructors and mentors? Your rela tionship with patients who might help you learn as they interact and respo nd to you? Key Principles: Fundamental qualities of mindf ul practitioners a re the following: attentive observation, critical curiosity, beginner' s mind a nd presence Unanticipa ted events will fill your work days Complex communications with patients and collea gues require more delibera tion than routine clinica l acts Your self-\u00adawareness will be a key to your ef fective clinical care You need practice paying attention to your own reactions and attitudes to be fully present for patients Failing to examine your communication behaviors will delude you a bout your competence at clinical communication You can avoid important mista kes through remaining mindful of how fatigue, emotional factors and avoidance affect your communication Learning go als: At the completion of this module, you will be a ble to: Describe how self -\u00adawareness improves clinical practice Describe how mindf ulness limits mistakes Describe why experience seldom builds competence Describe f undamental qualities of mindful practitioners Cite 4 \"reflective questions\" that lead to mindfulness Describe why mindfulness and self-\u00adawareness a re essential to improving professionalism Discuss with a colleague how you might practice becoming more mindful and self-\u00ada ware, and consider the pros and cons of starting such a practice INTRODUCTION This module examines specific communica tion skills that promote mindful awareness, a key to effective clinical practice. Mindfulness can also be applied to the acquisition of skills and knowledge, cultivation of caring and healing attitudes, and facing the anxiety of uncertainty. In this introduction section, you will f ind the following: POEM: The Guest House This being huma n is a guest house...Self-\u00adawareness is a key t o effective medical practice Mindfulness means focusing your a ttention on your own thoughts and feelings in the moment. Clinicians are vulnerable to erro rs in co mmunicat ion due t o lack of self-\u00adawareness Complex communications with patients and collea gues require more delibera tion than routine clinica l acts. The ro le of the unexpected in challenging clinicians to be mo re self-\u00adaware Unanticipa ted events pack the work da ys of medical professionals. \"Being Human is a Guest House\" Jelalludin Rumi (1207-\u00ad1273) (1 ) The Guest House This being huma n is a guest house. Every morning a new arrival. A joy, a depression, a meannness, some momenta ry awareness comes as an unexpected visitor. Welcome and entertain them all! Even if they're a crowd of sorrows, who violently sweep your house empty of its f urniture, still, treat each guest honora bly. He may be clearing you out for some new delight. The dark thought, the same, the malice, meet them at the door laughing, and invite them in. Be grateful for whoever comes, because each has been sent as a guide from beyond. Self-\u00adawareness is a key t o effective medical practice Mindfulness means focusing your a ttention on your own thoughts and feelings in the moment. Self-\u00adawareness is knowing your gifts, a reas for improvement, a ssumptions, prejudices and biases; toward people generally , toward patients, toward cognition, emotions, spirit and intuition in general, and toward these elements as they affect your professional work. Self-\u00adawareness is a key to eff ective medical practice.(2 ) Just as pianists must be attentive and aware of each small hand movement to ensure accuracy and eff iciency, ef fective clinicians must self-\u00admonitor the affect, tone of voice, choice of words, timing and emotional reactivity that they bring to each encounter. To avoid errors in diagnosis, we as clinicia ns must be aware of our own biases and tendencies towards prema ture closure. Also, in order to be fully present for patients, clinicians should work towards emotiona l health and balance in their lives. We believe that selfawareness, personal growth and well being should be specifically addressed in medical training. We have a ppended specific goals and objectives for this learning, as well as useful questions for reflection, that can lead to greater self awareness in relation to your patient care (see Appendix 1 and Appendix 2). While the importance of self -\u00adawareness may seem obvious, achieving self -\u00adawareness is not straightforward. This chapter is about tra ining f or mindf ulness -the qualities of attentive observation, critical curiosity, beginner's mind and presence that make possible the use of self-\u00ad awareness to influence clinical practice(3,4 ) Clinicians are vulnerable to erro rs in co mmunicat ion due t o lack of self-\u00adawareness Complex communications with patients and collea gues require more delibera tion than routine clinica l acts. Will Miller chara cterized clinica l practice as consisting of routines, dramas and ceremonies.(5 ) Routine clinical acts require little thought or psychological investment, dramatic situations require action in the moment, and ceremonies a re ritualized and symbolic acts that require presence. Similarly, medical decisions are often made on the basis of pattern-\u00adrecognition, on the evocation of complex remembered patterns of disease, and less commonly, through conscious deliberation. Some have a rgued for conscious deliberation of all medical decisions, but this is hardly practical. Unfortunately, automaticity brings the risk of unconscious incorporation of a ssumptions that may not be true, and emotional reactivity may override good judgment.(6 ) Communication with an individua l patient at a specif ic moment about a particular problem may appear routine or ceremonial, but requires us to be self-\u00adaware and attentive to unexpected twists, concerns or new information. The ro le of the unexpected in challenging clinicians to be mo re self-\u00adaware Unanticipa ted events pack the work da ys of medical professionals. In contrast to technicians, professionals not only follow protocols, but more importa ntly, learn how to individualize care, deal with unfamilia r and unanticipated situa tions, and make decisions with inadequate data, time or support. The \"uninvited guests\" described in Rumi' s poem are f amiliar to most of us: situations that involve ambiguity and uncertainty, situations in which there are conflicts between the needs of patients and clinicians, and situations chara cterized by strong emotions -\u00ad-\u00ad the patient's a nd our own. Technica l errors, contradictory evidence and recommendations, and unanticipated complications challenge us on a daily basis. Recognition that our own knowledge is impermanent, that our sense of competence is fragile, and that control over a situation is illusory can be unsettling to even very experienced clinicians. MINDFULNE SS, MINDLESSNESS AND DELUSION Mindfulness is \"paying attention, on purpose, to one's own mental and physica l processes during everyday tasks, so as to act with clarity a nd insight.\" Delusion is the tendency of the mind to seek premature closure and to confuse our view of things with the way things are.In response to difficult communications with patients and their f amilies, clinicia ns respond with varying degrees of mindf ulness and delusion. Mindfulness is a state of being that permits insight. Insight, in turn, makes correct action and compassion possible. Mindfulness \"leads the mind back from theories, attitudes and abstractions to the experience itself .\" Mindfulness is the study of subjective experience from the inside out. This subjective experience can include emotions, communication, ethi cal dilemmas, and procedural techniques. Mindfulness refers to a state of mind during everyday work, rather than analysis of our actions after the fact. The absence of mindf ulness is mindlessness and delusion. Mindless f orgetting, insensitivity or haste can result from f atigue, emotional overload or overwork, and might be thought of as a manifestation of distra ctibility. Delusion, on the other hand, i s a more clinically insidious phenomenon. It is \"the tendency of the mind to seek premature closure...tha t quality of mind that imposes a definition on things a nd then mistakes the definition for the actual experience\"(7 ). A common exa mple of delusion would be looking at a prior diagnosis rather tha n the patient' s current situation in order to make a clinical decision - in communica tion and in diagnostic thinking, the patient is not \"allowed\" to have experienced change. Another example would be the inability to adopt a new perspective and rethink an initia l impression of another person. A case example o f the lack o f mindfulness causing an unfavorable o utcome A tired resident admitted a 50-\u00adyear old man recently dia gnosed with bla dder cancer. In the emergency room, the patient was noted to have scanty urination, and wa s assumed to have been dehydrated. When IV fluids failed to increase the patient' s urinary output, the IV rate was increased. Beca use the diagnosis seemed so straightforwa rd, the resident did not think to check the patient's status. Several hours later, the patient, now in severe pain, wa s assumed by the nurse to be over-\u00adreacting. The following morning, another resident elicited a history of recent catheterization f or urinary obstruction a fter bladder surgery. At that point, the possibility of urina ry outflow obstruction entered the minds of those caring f or him. His pain was now considered justif iable and the pa tient was offered analgesia a nd insertion of a Foley catheter. After two liters of urine drained, the patient experienced relief of his pain. Lack of mindfulness is common, although not necessa rily as dramatic as the previous example. Poor information gathering ca n be the result of a mind closed by paying more attention to a presumed diagnosis to the clinical state of the patient. Low-\u00adlev el decision rules (6 ) can result in premature closure. In contrast, the misdiagnosis could have been questioned earlier by a dopting an attitude of attentiveness, curiosity, openness and doubt. As in this situation, mindlessness and delusion lead to poor judgment - by assuming things about patients that may not be true, or not acknowledging the limits of your informa tion or knowledge. One of the most difficult qua lities to teach and assess is presence - the sense of \"being there\", undistracted and in tune with the patient and his or her needs. These can a ll be aff ected by situational factors such as fa tigue; each of us has a threshold beyond which judgment begins to suff er. We can learn techniques, such a s those described below, for recognizing when our own cognitive and emotional processing are not optimal, and making appropria te adjustments to avoid miscommunications and errors. Cognit ive psycho logy of mindfulness and communicat ion Competent practitioners use both \"tacit\" knowledge and \"explicit\" knowledge. Tacit knowledge is hard to express, and derives from experience. Communication behaviors develop f rom alifetime's experience, but that experience is seldom carefully examined, and frequently produces \"delusions.\" The idea of mindfulness is based in cognitive psychology, which describes two types of knowledge necessary to be clinically competent -\u00ad-\u00ad tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge. Tacit knowledge is what one knows but finds difficult to express. An exa mple is how to ride a bicycle, or in medical contexts, how to recognize that a person is sick. Some educators and philosophers sugges t that tacit knowledge is the core of professiona l competence. Explicit knowledge is what can be easily explained, perhaps the differential diagnosis of a cough in a 70-\u00adyear old smoker. Communication skills are usually tacit; that is, clinicia ns rarely think in the moment, \"I have just used an open-\u00ad ended question.\" Tacit knowledge depends on experience, but experience do es not necessarily build compete nce. Repeated mistakes may constitute experience, and lead to unexamined errors in tacit knowledge, which we call \"delusion\". Tacit assumptions may be unveiled as delusions and come to explicit awareness when a patient responds in an unexpected manner. For example, a student said, \"I understand\" in a n attempt to be empathic, and wa s taken a back when the patient replied, \"You couldn't possibly understa nd unless you had what I have\". Delusion can take other forms as well. For example, when a sked about their communication behaviors, clinicians commonly believe they \"regularly employ\" certain skills, but when interviews are directly observed, their use of these skills is f requently not confirmed. We may believe tha t we give patients choices and solicit patients' questions but observation shows otherwi se. One wa y to counter such assumptions is to video-\u00adrecord consultations and review them later. Another way is to cultivate the ability to recall exactly what was sa id rather than sustaining a delusion of what \"must have\" taken place. Finally, medical practice frequently involves multi-\u00adtasking and even though it seems efficient, decreased attentiveness to the individua l tasks often results in ignoring what would otherwise be obvious. Mindfulness and clinical erro rs Becoming more mindful of how f atigue, emotional f actors and avoidance affect communication may eliminate important mistakes. At 3am a clinician working the night shift in the emergency department encounters an adolescent female patient who complains of lower abdominal pain. She initially denies that anything happened that might have cause d the pain. The clinician is trained in taking a sexual history, knows a bout the epidemiology of sexual and physical abuse, and has cared f or victims of rape. At 3pm, encountering the same patient, this clinician would have inquired further - were any drugs or alcohol taken? Are you sure no one has tried to hurt you? You seem nervous - could you tell me if that is true? Would you prefer to talk with a female doctor? B ut, at 3am, those questions were not asked. The clinicia n reassures herself and the patient that this is a case of gastroenteritis or irritable bowel, and misses an important opportunity to identify sexual abuse and prevent future episodes. The \"lesion\" in this interaction was not lack of knowledge or experience on the part of the clinician. Rather, it was a context-\u00addriven tendency tow ard premature closure - perhaps due to fatigue, perhaps because the clinician imagined the increased emotional energy, forms to be filled out and telephone calls required should a history of sexual abuse or rape be elicited.(6 ) The \"cognitive alibi\" - that the patient has symptoms of a gastrointestina l disorder - seemed suf ficient to justify not inquiring further. Now, imagine what would have happened if the clinicia n had been more mindful - if she had ability to recognize her tendency towards ignoring certain aspects of the patient's history when tired, her inability to question her own thinking, her need to distance herself emotionally a nd her ha sty decision-\u00admaking. Perha ps a more mindful response to a complexsituation would have resulted in a better outcome. HABITS OF MINDFUL PRACTITIONERS Fundamental qualities of mindful practitioners are attentive observation, critical curiosity, beginner's mind and presence. The goal of mindfulness - and its four components - is to promote effective communication, wise decisions, a nd caring attitudes. Mindfulness includes a wareness of the body, thoughts, emotions and sensations, and attention to our own level of mental alertness and restlessness. This section is about: Attentive observat ion Attentive observa tion refers to the capacity to observe our own behavior while simultaneously being attentive to the patient - \"observing the observer while observing the observed\". Critical curiosity Critica l curiosity chara cterizes a mindful clinician's response to the unexpected. Beginner's mind \"Beginner' s mind\" means being willing and able to see a familiar situation with new eyes, setting aside biases, categoriza tions a nd pre-\u00adconceived ideas. Presence \"Presence\" involves being there, physica lly, cognitively and emotionally and a single-\u00adminded attitude toward healing a nd care. Attentive observat ion Attentive observa tion refers to the capacity to observe our own behavior while simultaneously being attentive to the patient - \"observing the observer while observing the observed\". Attentiveness involves both focus on the task at hand and also the capacity to see or hear things that are not in your direct f ocus, nor what you might be expecting to see or hear. B y welcoming the unexpected, the attentive practitioner is able to examine data that might otherwise have been ignored. A ttentiveness can be encouraged by example, trained using videotape review, and promoted by reflective questioning. One can also be attentive to one's own state of mind. Recog nizing that judgment may be impaired by fatigue or strong emotions (that may have nothing directly to do with the pa tient) is the first step in avoiding errors due to misperceptions or unclear thinking. Critical curiosity Critica l curiosity chara cterizes a mindful clinician's response to the unexpected.Listening for the unexpected involves the ability to find surprise in the ordinary actions of daily work, and to listen to yourself and others without naming what is heard until it has been understood. In practice critical curiosity translates into a voiding premature closure. Rather than ignoring disconfirming or upsetting data, mindful clinicians engage in a disciplined f urther questioning or listening to the patient, and questioning their own judgment. Critica lly curious clinicians tolera te and le arn from errors. Critical curiosity is not the seemingly undisciplined curiosity of a young child, and retains the capacity for filtering and judgment. Mindful clinicia ns are constantly vigilant f or disconf irming evidence, and hesitate to assume that a ll relevant data have been elicited and processed. \"Beginner's mind\" \"Beginner' s mind\" means being willing and able to see a familiar situation with new eyes, setting aside biases, categoriza tions and pre-\u00adconceived idea s. The goal of medical education is to acquire expertise, but expertise has its dangers. As clinicians develop a taxonomy of illness and suff ering, and categories of experience-\u00adbased treatment protocols, they can lose the perspective that a newcomer might bring, an important element of mindfulness. The educator John D ewey called this perspective \"cultivated naivet\u00e9\" - or the capacity to adopt a \"beginner's mind\". In the case of the patient with urinary obstruction, those caring f or the patient were not able to disentangle their ima ge of the patient from the patient' s actual experience. B y placing the patient in a category (\"dehydrated patient\"), they were unable to ask about, perceive or respond to symptoms that were obvious clues. \"Presence\" \"Presence\" involves being there, physically, cognitively and emotionally and a single-\u00ad minded attitude toward healing a nd care. Clinicians with presence are those who have the ability to lower reactivity and not be distracted by anxiety, in order to focus on the task and the patient rather than their own assumptions, needs and formula tions. Presence includes patience, personal involvement and caring. Presence is required for the expression of compassion, because without it, attempts to be compassionate may be misdirected and inadequately address the patient's needs. BECOMING MINDFUL You can become mindful, if you learn the chara cteristic behaviors of mindfulness and attend to developing and maintaining these skills and qua lities in your work.(8 ) The qualities are listed below and examined in deta il in the following paragraphs: Priming \"Priming\" means that clinicians have developed the expectation that they will be able toreport their own mental processes. Being available Being available means developing an openness to experience, learning to expect the unexpected, avoiding judging experiences as \"good\" or \"bad\". Reflective quest ions Reflective questions that invite doubt disrupt habitual patterns of thought and behavior to allow a familiar situation to be seen in a new way, and to discover the uniqueness that is present. Active engagement Professional educa tion should include f requent sustained contact between teacher and learner, observing the learners' active engagement in thinking, skill development and personal awa reness. Role mo deling and t hinking out loud Faculty members who model \"thinking out loud\" thus emphasize that professional medical practice requires the consta nt effort of recognizing a nd correcting for errors, rather than a linear pursuit of protocol. Practice \"Practice\" is disciplined repetition in controlled settings. \"Practiced behaviors\" become skills that require less effort to use daily Self-\u00admo nitoring Self-\u00admonitoring refers to being aware of any disparity between intention and action, and between the imagined ef fect a nd the eff ect produced. Assessment and co nfirmatio n We suggest tha t mindfulness be one criterion for assessment of trainees. Priming \"Priming\" means that clinicians have developed the expectation that they will be able to report their own mental processes. For example, a primed student and resident can report not only their clinical findings, but also their own thoughts and feelings during the visit. They can observe what they do to prepare themselves for each encounter. D o they stop for a moment? Do they complete the previous patient's chart? Do they develop a mental list of tasks? D o they take a deep breath? An early reflective question (\"How might your prior clinica l experience af fect your decision-\u00admaking in this case?\") might help set the stage for mindful inquiry. Other priming activities take place outside of the clinica l setting. Reading poe try, for example, can invite an intense focus on the present moment. (9) Being available Being available means developing an openness to experience, to learn to expect the unexpected, avoiding judging experiences as \"good\" or \"bad\". Being available means quiet moments within the chaotic hea lth care and clinica l educationalenvironments. Training programs can use formats such as \"reflection groups\" to discuss clinica l situations that raised dif ficulties for participants,(10 ,11) \"Balint groups\" that explore strong emotional reactions that aff ect clinical care,(12 ) and \"family of origin groups\" that explore trainees' experience of their f amilies' values and their cultural norms in order to understand their positive and negative reactions to patients.(13 ,14) Other f ormats that help the learner f ocus on the present include videotape reviews that remind practitioners of their emotions and biases, and provides space to examine them. Keeping a journal, medita tion, and exercise are individua l means to this end. However valuable these educationa l experiences are in themselves, their value is in prepa ring the learner to be present and available in real clinica l situations. Clinica l preceptors can model the presence and attentive availability that facilitates patient encounters. Reflective quest ions Reflective questions are designed to help clinicians doubt their initial impressions, disrupt habitual patterns of thought and behavior, see a familiar situa tion in a new wa y and discover the uniqueness of each situation. Reflective questions are designed not to edify, but rather to invite doubt and ambiguity. A sking reflective questions helps clinicia ns to identify opportunities f or learning, seize them, and discover their own answers. For example, da ta gathering is commonly conditioned by the expected diagnosis. A resident might expect that a f atigued patient has a viral syndrome, and \"forget\" to ask about sleep, moods or f eelings that might suggest tha t the fatigue derives from depression. Asking yourself, \"Wha t am I a ssuming about this patient tha t might not be true?\" ca n provoke curiosity in an open-\u00adended way, and improve diagnostic thinking. The answer may not be as important a s the process of inquiry -\u00ad in fact, many reflective questions have no answers. Faculty members can help students internalize a habit of self -\u00adquestioning tha t will improve the trainee's ability to listen and observe. Teachers should ask, \"What did you observe?\" \"In what ways were you surprised?\", \"How did you respond to the feeling of surprise\", \"What interfered with your observations?\" and also, \"If there were relevant data that you ignored, wha t might they be?\" The teaching of clinica l ethics benef its from using ref lective questions. A preceptor can comment on \"tacit ethics of the moment\" a s reflected in small gestures tha t often go unnoticed in daily practice. They ca n ask learners to note those small moral acts, such as how nods of the head convey interest or not, or how the clinician acknowledges an error to a patient Table o f reflective quest ions \"How might my prior experiences af fect my actions with this patient?\" \"What a m I assuming a bout this patient tha t might not be true?\" \"What surprised me about this patient?\" \"How did I respond?\" \"What interfered with my ability to observe, be attentive or be respectf ul with this patient?\" \"How could I be more present with and available to this patient?\" \"Were there a ny points at which I wanted to end the visit prematurely?\" \"If there were relevant data tha t I ignored, what might they be?\" \"What would a trusted peer say about the way I managed this situation?\" \"Were there a ny points at which I felt judgmenta l about the patient - in a positive or negative way?\" Active engagement Professional educa tion should include frequent susta ined contact between tea cher and learner, observing the learners' active enga gement in thinking, skill development and personal awareness. Medical education is too often structured as if the most dif ficult matters are learned without critique or mentoring. In his essa y, \"What if they taught musicians the way that medical students are trained?\" Engel (15) describes an imaginary scenario in which music students would never be observed a ctually playing their instruments, a nd would report what they had done. We can laugh at this absurdity, but need to examine closely what we do in medical education. The making of musicians requires that technique be made suff iciently automatic so tha t they do not have to think about every muscle movement, but can maintain enough subsidiary awareness to recognize when technique needs more focused attention. Similarly, they bring awareness to the harmonic structure at key tra nsitional moments, but let it inform the interpretation in a more tacit way a t other times. Competent clinicians know how to actively engage with patients while balancing personal awareness, skill use and cognitive rea soning, just as musicians hav e the awareness, technique and knowledge to be musically expressive and to simultaneously listen from the perspective of the audience. Role mo deling and t hinking o ut loud Faculty members who model \"thinking out loud\" thus emphasize that professional medical practice requires the consta nt effort of recognizing a nd correcting for errors, rather than a linear pursuit of protocol. Thinking out loud can help convert tacit knowledge to explicit, a nd reveal paradoxes and inconsistencies between intended a nd real effects of our actions. This can occur while teaching about communica tion, clinical reasoning or even technical skills. For example, surgical training now includes virtual reality training to help residents \"think out loud\" while perf orming simulated procedures that involve fine manipulations of laparoscopic instruments. A simila r process can provide in-\u00adthe-\u00admoment feedback on communication behaviors using videotape or live observation. Practice \"Practice\" is disciplined repetition in controlled settings. \"Practiced behaviors\" become skills that require less effort to use daily. Among performing artists, a common saying is, \"in discipline is freedom.\" Practice requires an object, real or imagined , external or internal. The object of meditation is one's own thought process, of music it is sound a nd the audience, and of medicine it is the patient and the learner. Availability, a ctive engagement, listening deeply (especia lly to those things that we'd rather not hear), generosity a nd \"beginner' s mind\" can be practiced. \"Unexpecting\" is an aspect of practice that refers to training ourselves to recognize our expectations, and then imagine another outcome. Curiosity can be practiced. For example, try spending 15 minutes simply recording in writing the names of all red things that you see. Even such a simple exercise can bring awa reness to one's tendency to become excited, bored, curious or a nnoyed when presented with a routine task. Participants usually report suddenly categorizing the world in to red things, which are of interest, and non-\u00adred things, which are ignored. Then they wonder about those categories a sking, \"How reddoes something have to be to be considered 'red'?\" A parallel situa tion would be for clinicia ns to question the categories to which the symptoms are assigned. Practicing presence involves developing habits of reflection, such as including in each day opportunities for complete silence a nd stillness. Stillness can be f ound during work-\u00adrelated tasks. It is a tool that performing musicians use -\u00ad an inner stillness in order to project energy to the audience. Precious moments of repose occur even during a busy day-\u00ad-\u00ad the sma ll moments of inaction between actions. The visceral learning from practicing stillness a llows clinicia ns to experience tha t stillness when they need to call upon it (making the knowledge explicit) -\u00ad to clear the mind bef ore seeing the next patient, to perform a delicate procedure, or to listen more deeply to a disturbing story. Stillness apart f rom professional life might include doing meditation, observing nature or listening to music. This is not a \"new age\" or mystical process - it is a quality of mind that ha s been consciously cultivated by master clinicians, concert pianists and tennis champions. (16) Self-\u00admo nitoring Self-\u00admonitoring refers to being aware of any disparity between intention and action, and between the imagined ef fect and the eff ect produced. Self-\u00admonitoring refers to the moment-\u00adto-\u00admoment a wareness of one's intentions (e.g., to f ind out what's wrong) and one's actions (e.g. fa cilitating or cutting off conversations). Self-\u00admonitoring involves observing the observer a t the same time you are observing the observed. Part of why this is diff icult to do is that we judge ourselves harshly, and do not like to see that our actions sometimes diverge from our intent ions. When we misunderstand a patient, make an error or suffer from ignorance, we f eel badly. And, we tend to avoid in the future the types of situations that produced discomfort in us in the past. A skilled clinician anticipates the effect of a gesture or statement to a patient a nd carefully tracks the ef fect of that attempted communication - and if there is some evidence that communication has been inadequate in some way, makes corrections to achieve mutual understanding. (17 ) Assessment and co nfirmatio n We suggest tha t mindfulness be one criterion for assessment of trainees. Patients may be able to assess \"presence,\" and undistracted attention. Tolerance of uncerta inty can be assessed through direct observation and debrief ing. Evidence of curiosity is manifest in the use of reflective questions and \"thinking out loud.\" You can set your persona l expectations by saying, \"No t only will I be looking at how I solve the clinica l problems and how I relate to patients, but also I will be assessing how I reflect on my own perf ormance.\" Peer ratings and self-\u00adratings can be helpful. We can a ll learn to identify things tha t we have learned about medicine, or ourselves, in the course of caring f or patients. HEALTH SYSTEMS CAN EMBODY THE SAME PRINCIPLES OF MINDFULNESS AS INDIVIDUALS A mindful approach to systems problems has some of the same chara cteristics as mindfulness in individua l practitioners.(18 ) Mindful systems tolera te ambiguity, minimize errors and emphasize creative approaches to work.A young man underwent a lymph node dissection f or testicular cancer. Af ter dissecting the left kidney, the surgeon turned his attention to the right kidney, and was no longer able to see the left one. A medical student in the OR noted tha t the left kidney began to turn a dusky blue color. Alarmed, he mentioned this to the attending surgeon, who denied that there was a problem and chastised the medical student f or interrupting the operation. A few minutes later the kidney had turned a dusky violet color. The student spoke to the nurse, who relayed the information to a resident, and then to the surgeon. The surg eon attempted to restore blood flow, and ultimately called in a vascular surgeon to perform a delicate procedure to repair a tear in the arterial lining . The patient's kidney function was a bnormal f ollowing the surgery; the pa tient and fa mily were told that there was an unexpec ted and unavoidable complication of surgery. Researchers of medical errors have focused on the structure of health care teams to find root causes of these errors. Chaotic process and faulty communica tion among professionals in the operating room led to an avoidable error, and organ damage worsened. The hiera rchical team structure and an a tmosphere of blame and retribution prevented early corrective a ction. In this case, the lack of mindfulness had ethical ramifications as well. The \"cover-\u00adup\" af ter the event was partially determined by the malpractice climate and advice from risk ma nagement personnel never to admit an error to a patient. Mindful systems should be vigilant, and assume that systems tend to fail in unpredictable ways. For difficult problems, a tolerance for complexity and ambiguity will favor accura te observation and creative solutions, rather than oversimplification a nd premature closure. Critica l curiosity - thinking \"outside the box\" - is characteristic of high-\u00adfunctioning individuals and systems. Brainstorming is one way of fostering curiosity, but only works if the ground rules include considera tion of options that initially seem unorthodox. Administrators of large systems ca n easily lose track of the rea lities on the shop floor, and open, non-\u00adpunitive communication can facilitate transparency of intent ra ther than hiding of errors. Systems can be set up that promote f lexibility rather than reinf orcing a single rigid process for dealing with problems. Flexibility, in turn, leads to greater suppleness and resilience. Finally, mindful systems include mechanisms to recognize that expertise and hierarchy may not be synonymous; the janitor may have a more accura te perspective on local infection control than the chief of the infectious disease service. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION Mindfulness, a quality of clinicians and health systems, is fundamentally a set of habits of mind and habits of practice in the moment. These habits can be taught and learned, a nd professiona ls and syste ms who have these habits deliver very high quality medical care. Mindful practice is an approach to self-\u00adknowledge a nd a component of professionalism, in the service of improved patient outcomes. These outcomes include patient health status, prevention of medical errors, patient trust and adherence to treatment, clinician growth and satisfaction, and lower health care costs. Mindfulness may be facilit ated by exercises and f orums outside the context of daily work but includes more than retrospective analysis of clinica l actions. Many principles of mindful practice can be observed in master clinicians, even though they may not name it as such. Methods f or fostering mindfulness in clinical practice can be successf ully incorporated into educational programs. APPENDIX 1: PERSONAL AWARENESS IN MEDICINE: QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL REFLECTION I.

For thousa nds of years, before the modern era of efficacious drugs and other medical interventions, sick people have sought care f rom clinicians. Many of these patients experienced relief and started on the road to healing. How did this happen? If we can identify the therapeutic elements of clinica l encounters, we can be intentional about maximizing these elements with patients. There a re severa l core concepts that help us understand the therapeutic efficacy of clinicia n-\u00ad patient encounters: the biopsychosocial model, the importance of meaning, clinicians' healing attitudes, and the healing power of caring in clinician-\u00adpatient relationships. Questio ns fo r Reflect ion: How can you promote healing of your patients' illnesses, in addition to curing their diseases? What might get in the way of your expressing your caring to patients? In your own visits to clinicians, wha t have they done that promoted your trust, hope and relief of anxiety? What are your persona l qualities that will promote healing in your patients? What are your dreams for yourself as doctor? Key Principles: Clinical relationships can be therapeutic, independent of your biomedical diagnostic and treatment activities. You can enhance therapeutic and healing aspects of encounters by identifying windows of opportunity and employing specif ic interview skills in those moments. You can learn counseling strategies that help your patients cope with stress and illness and change unhealthy behaviors. Learning go als: At completion of this module, you will be able to: Describe core concepts underlying the therapeutic ef ficacy of the clinician patient relationship List the therapeutic goals of medical encounters Describe strategies that advance the therapeutic aims of your medical encountersINTRODUCTION Clinician patient encounters are therapeutic in a nd of themselves, independently of diagnostic and therapeutic activities of proven eff ectiveness. For thousands of years, before the modern era of efficacious drugs and other medical interventions, sick people have sought care f rom clinicians. Many of these patients experienced relief and started on the road to healing. How did this happen? If we can identify the therapeutic elements of clinical encounters, we can be intentional about maximizing these elements with patients. There a re severa l core concepts that help us understand the therapeutic ef ficacy of clinician-\u00ad patient encounters: the biopsychosocial model, the importance of meaning, clinicians' healing attitudes, and the healing power of caring in clinician-\u00adpatient relationships. In the intr oduction section of this module you'll find the following: The Bio psychosocial Model The B iopsychosocia l Model, first articulated by George Engel, (1) views people as integrated biological and psychologica l beings who behave in certain ways in their social contexts. The Impact of meaning in medical care All humans create meaning, all the time. The meanings that patients ascribe to symptoms affect their illness outcomes and ability to function well. Holding and co mmunicat ing healing attitudes Clinicians are themselves \"thera peutic instruments.\" Your words a nd behaviors communicate your a ttitudes and are powerf ul change agents. The healing po wer of clinicians' caring Perhaps the most fundamental of a ll healing attitudes is your caring for each patient. The Bio psychosocial Model The B iopsychosocia l Model, first articulated by George Engel, (1) views people as integrated biological and psychologica l beings who behave in certain ways in their social contexts. Changes in any one of these dimensions of huma n functioning af fect a ll of them. The field of psychosomatic medicine has produced copious scientif ic evidence confirming the biopsychosocial model. (2 ) As examples, stress, depression and social isolation are associated with physiologic and anatomical changes that promote disease. Unhealthy behaviors such as smoking and drug abuse also promote the pathophysiology of diseases. The biopsychosocial model assumes the essential unity of mind, body and spirit. One way to understand this unity is to realize that thought, feelings, and abstract rea soning a re also neurobiological processes. While you are rea ding this, neurochemical processes are being stimulated in your brain. Basic changes in m-\u00adRNA a nd neurotransmitter metabolism are occurring as new information is being processed. If your f eelings are aroused, neuroendocrine mechanisms are af fecting other bodily processes. All of which, in turn, ca n affect your behaviors, as well a s basic physiologic processes tha t modulate immunity and innumerable body f unctions. Thus, in thinking scientifica lly about illness and disea se, you must consider the biological, psychological, behaviora l, and social factors that contribute to your patient's illness. You can lea rn to use your understanding of biopsychosocial interactions to counselyour patients so they can change their rea ctions to stress, recover from depression, reengage with their loved ones a nd community, and change maladaptive behaviors. One practical exercise that you can do to understand how a biopsychosocial approach can be useful with individual patients is to ask the question, \"why is this patient ill now (as opposed to 6 months ago or 2 years f rom now, or never)? The answer to this question often reveals an interplay of biologica l, psychological and socia l factors in a patient's life. For example: In my (D ennis Novack) doctoring curriculum for medicine interns, we interview a random patient on the wards to see if we can answer that question. We interviewed a 55-\u00adyear-\u00adold woma n in her street clothes who was about to be discharged f rom a f our-\u00adday admission for severe abdominal pain. The workup had proven inconclusive. When we asked her about recent stress in her life, she revealed that she was currently the main caregiver for her mother-\u00adin-\u00adlaw, who was currently dying from ovarian cancer. Caring for her mother-\u00adin-\u00adlaw was difficult enough without much help from other family members, and while trying to maintain a full-\u00adtime job. However, it was also the one-\u00ad year anniversary of her mother's death. She had also been very close with her mother, who had died of pancreatic cancer. Both her mother and mother-\u00adin-\u00adlaw had experienced a good deal of abdominal pain. We expla ined to her how stress can ca use G.I. cramping, and ta lked with her about how she could possibly get some support for her caregiving role. Another patient demonstra ted how personality a nd social factors contribute to presenting for care: We interviewed a 29-\u00adyea r-\u00adold woman with widely metastatic choriocarcinoma . She was pale and weak, and could not sit up. We asked her when she had noticed that her health wasn't quite right. She replied that she knew something was wrong a bout 8 or 9 months previously. However, she is a single mom without insurance and had to work 2 jobs to support her 3 children. She was determined that she could not be sick and did not seek care. One day, she could not get out of bed, and one of her children called 911. The Impact of meaning in medical care All humans create meaning, all the time. The meanings that patients ascribe to symptoms affect their illness outcomes and ability to function well. The meanings we ascribe to our patients' illnesses and behaviors af fect our interactions with them. (3) Clinicians have many opportunities to use skills f or helping patients understand symptoms, reframe meaning and cope with illness. The wa y people experience illness is a function of both their somatic alterations (i.e. changes in their anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, etc.) as well as a host of psychological, social, and behaviora l factors. The experience of illness depends on what patients say to themselves. Illness is associated with symptoms which trigger a series of thoughts, beliefs and concerns as well as emotional a nd behavioral responses. For example, in predisposed individuals stress may precipitate contraction or spasm of temporal or cervical muscles, causing a headache. Some will think of this headache as a minor nuisance that will eventually go away on its own, while others may become concerned that it signif ies a serious underlying problem like a brain tumor. These concerns ca n lead to feelings of anxiety as well as maladaptive behaviors, such as more vigilant monitoring of symptoms and decreased activity or social isolation. This sets up a vicious cycle that is likely to worsen symptoms and dysfunction. Many factors influence how people ascribe meaning to a symptom. Some people view their symptoms in a pessimistic manner (e.g. it will never get better) while others think a bout the same health problem more optimistica lly. People va ry in their perceptions about their ability to control health problems. People with a high level of self -\u00adefficacy take remedial steps on their own, while those with lower self-\u00adeff icacy rely on others, such a s mothers, clinicia ns and alternative heal ers.Attributions about ca uses of health problems vary as well, and some people blame themselves f or the cause of problems. S ome believe the cause will never change, while others see the cause a s a temporary phenomenon. S ome people f eel their illness aff ects everything a bout them (e.g. if I have diabetes I must be a sick person) while others think of health problems as but one aspect of who they are (e.g. I am an energetic, vital person who happens to have diabetes). The reactions of family, friends and clinicians can reinforce the sick role and f urther increase patients' concerns, and ultimately both the severity of symptoms a nd the level of dysfunction. Stressful events or social isola tion may deplete the person' s ability to adequately cope with new health problems. In our role as caregivers, we also attribute meaning to symptoms and patients' behaviors, and need to be aware of our attributions so that we can provide the objective and unbiased care. (See module 2) Additionally, clinicians can respond helpfully to meanings patients ascribe to sickness, reassure them, educate them, reframe their situa tions so that they see new meanings in their illnesses, and guide them to adopt healthy behaviors. Holding and co mmunicat ing healing attit udes Clinicians are themselves \"thera peutic instruments.\" Your words and behaviors communicate your a ttitudes and are powerf ul change agents. To become maximally eff ective, you must \"calibrate your instrument.\" (4) You must ask yourself if you are fully committed to your patients' healing and well-\u00adbeing, a nd whether you have the ability to express a sense of caring in words, nonverba lly and in deeds. If you feel hope, optimism and caring toward your patients, your activities have a high likelihood of being helpf ul. If you feel annoyed with certain patients, or feel judgmental about their inability or unwilling ness to change unhealthy behaviors, your words and ma nner inevitably communicate those f eelings a nd undermine your thera peutic eff orts. If you are not a ble to communicate empathy and interest in the pa tient as a person in a particular situation, your good intentions are much less appa rent to patients. Your patience, tolera nce and generally positive outlook will be f requently tested. For example, you may need to make patients unhappy or angry, such as when communicating unpleasa nt news, or telling them crucia l information, (e.g., \"I think your diagnosis is alcohol dependence,\" or, \"Your bone scan shows that your cancer has spread.\") If you focus more on your f ear of hurting patients' feelings in the moment than on caring f or them over hours, days or years, you will temper your message a nd be less ef fective. If you f ind yourself less than fully committed or lacking certain abilities, you may need to \"recalibrate your instrument,\" that is, strive to understand your values, attitudes a nd biases as they become barriers to your care and to learn skills to communicate your caring in a broad range of challenging situations. For example, one clinician reported, \"I was working up a patient who is newly a dmitted for an AIDS-\u00adrelated illness. He was a 33-\u00adyear-\u00adold man who had also been previously admitted for infections related to his IV drug abuse. When I asked him how he a fforded his medications, he replied, \"I do home invasions.\" I looked a t him in surprise, \"home invasions?\" I asked. He said, \"yeah, I break into people's homes, hold them a t gunpoint, tie them up, a nd take their things.\" I suddenly fel t a sense of anger and outrage at the suffering tha t he caused others, which I have to say limited my pity for his obvious distress.\" How can you, as a clinician, put a side your judgments and negative emotional responses to treat all of your patients with compassion, a nd to envision and promote hea ling of their illnesses? If you believe that all of your patients have the possibility of redemption and healing in their futures, you will be more eff ective in offering them hope, which is perhaps the most motivating of all human emotional states.The healing po wer o f clinicians' caring Perhaps the most fundamental of a ll healing attitudes is your caring for each patient. Peabody observed, in a famous address to Harvard medical students in 1925 (5), that \"...the secret of the care of the patient is in caring for the patient.\" When patients are ill, they are often hurt, apprehensive and confused. Independent, self -\u00adsufficient people will lose confidence, become dependent and may regress in their rela tionships with others and with their clinicia ns. They yearn to be taken care of, to experience the comfort and caring of a loving parent. Patients wil l often \"project\" that need and see their clinicians in a parental role. Though you may be a medical student, resident or young attending, even elderly patients will often unconsciously see you in tha t way. To the extent that you can express your caring, your support, your understanding, your willingness to be with the patient wha tever comes or whatever they say, you will be providing comfort, safety, reassurance and healing. Expressing your caring can assist you to listen and become present with another person. Ma ny clinicians in practice have the experience of patients staying alive, or not giving up, because they have clearly expressed their caring to the patient in words and deeds. Many have experienced their pa tients' apprecia tion in return, which reinf orces the \"caring\" attitude, nourishes t he healthy human cycle of people caring f or each other, and enriches clinicians' lives and work. Many of you said to your medical school interviewer, \"I want to help people,\" or other expressions of your desire to care for others. Sometimes this core value gets suppressed by the stresses and demands of medical educa tion and patient care. Many students and clinicia ns can at times become cynical or burnt out. D epression and anxiety are more common a mong medical students and clinicians than in the general population. It is so important to care for yourself (please read module 4) so that you can be f ully present for patients, express your ca ring to patients, and stay connected to your core values as a clinician. Other key co ncept s There a re other features of doctor-\u00adpatient relationships tha t from time immemorial ha ve promoted healing. Other concepts help explain the survival of medicine as a profession through the thousands of years of few efficacious remedies for diseases. These all relate to clinician's words and behaviors: Listening: Think about your experiences of being truly listened to, and how that has been helpf ul to you. We are social crea tures, and depend on each other for support and sus tenance. Clinicians have always been able to listen, understand, a nd offer emotional support, which can help patients feel less isolated and more hopeful. Allaying anxiety, sadness, and grief: Illness often creates a much anxiety and sadness, as well as grief reactions f or lost functionality. To the extent that clinicians' reassurance can help lessen these emotions, the distress that worsens a patient' s sense of dis-\u00adease, or illness, a bate. Allowing/facilit ating emo expressio n: All recognize the often salutary ef fects of a good cry. To the extent that a clinician allows and fa cilitates a patient's emotiona l expressions associated with stress and illness, patients can of ten feel a sense of relief and a lessening ofworries. Giving an explanat ion: Uncertainty is a disturbing emotional state. When clinicia ns give diagnoses and prognoses, patients ca n feel rea ssured that there is something to do or that can be done to ameliora te the illness, and are able to plan accordingly f or the f uture. Offering ho pe: Hopelessness is one of the most noxious of emotional states, and associated with negative physiologic processes as well. Hope is motivating and contributes to the healing process. Clinicians ca n always off er hope, if not of a cure then perhaps of relief of pain and lessening of suffering. Touch: All healing disciplines have used touch, including \"laying on of hands,\" massage, or simply putting a hand on a shoulder as a gesture of reassurance. Touch can be a powerf ul nonverbal expression of a clinician's concern and carin g. Using the placebo respo nse: Because of modern neuroimaging, we now know some of the neural circuitry underlying the pla cebo response. These processes a re complicated, and involve dopaminergic and opiodergic systems in the brain. (14 , 15) Also, the likelihood of being a placebo responder is to some extent hardwired. Clinicians throughout time, though, have always been able to invoke the placebo response, using their words to engender hope, positive expectancies, and behaviors that reinforce progress toward the healing of illness. All of these processes are part of the placebo response. THERAPEUTIC GOALS OF THE MEDICAL ENCOUNTER The sp ecific therapeutic goals of the medical encounter are to: 1. recognize and understand the full extent of the patient's health problem(s), 2. promote effective patient participation in their care, 3. modif y maladaptive health behaviors, 4. facilitate patients' efforts to cope with their disea se and other stressful lif e events, 5. improve patients' satisfaction with their care and their health status, 6. enhance patients' self esteem and well-\u00adbeing. In so doing, clinicians will derive certain benef its as well, these benef its include: 1. attract and retain more patients, 2. decrease their risk of medical malpractice suits, 3. increase their sense of professional satisfaction. The process of accomplishing these goals involves six tasks. Clinicians need to: 1) understand their patients and their health problems, 2) demonstrate interest and concern, 3) inf orm and involve the patient in their care, 4) provide counseling, 5) create trust and confidence, and 6) demonstrate support and respect. There are a set of strategies clinicians can use to accomplish each of these tasks. These strategies may be designed to change the way a patient thinks about their problems (i.e. cognitive strategies), the emotional distress tha t has contributed to or resulted from their health problems (i.e. affective strategies) and the ma ladaptive beha viors associated with the problem, (i.e. behaviora l strategies). In the remainder of this module , we will review each of these therapeutic tasks and discuss how they can be accomplished during the medical encounter. These tasks are well covered in the modules to follow, but we will highlight some of the essentials. Understanding Pat ients and their Healt h Pro blems This is a major task in the therapeutic process. Achieving a comprehensive understanding of the factors contributing to the onset a nd maintenance of a patient's illness guides therapeutic interventions. How are patients' stressf ul life situations, emotional states, personalities, past histories of trauma or abuse, f inancial worries, etc. contributing to the illness? By the end of your interview with p atients, you should have a good understanding of the biological, psychological, behaviora l and social fa ctors that contribute to the onset a nd maintenance of their illnesses. Patients seldom hesitate to express somatic symptoms, but are typically more guarded both in disclosing emotional symptoms or stressf ul life problems, and unveiling pertinent details. These problems in patients' lives are common h owever, f requently not recognized, and they can ca use or contribute to the patient's health problems. It is a lso importa nt to understand patients' belief s and concerns, goals and expectations for the management of their health problems. These issues will usually not be discussed unless you directly ask. Evaluating these issues can f acilitate more effective and more satisfactory management decisions. F or exa mple, a patient who presents with a headache may have one or more of the f ollowing five goals in mind f or the visit: 1) obtain something from the clinician to relieve the symptom, 2) learn how to prevent headaches from recurring, 3) reassurance about the cause of the headache, 4) receive help for the stress that is causing the headache, 5) obtain administrative help like a note for work. Each of these goals will require a different set of management strategies. Failure to recognize a patient's goal(s), concerns, and expectations often provide in ineff ective and unsatisf actory care. Understanding these aspects of the patient's problems requires that you begin by asking open ended questions and give patients sufficient time to fully respond. Skills tha t facilitate a comprehensive response to an open question like, \"How have you been doing since your last visit?\" are discussed in module 8. Usually, you have to ask directly about patients' beliefs (e.g. \"What have you thought mig ht be causing your problems?\"), concerns (e.g. \"What concerns do you have about this problem?\"), goa ls (e.g. \"In what ways do you hope to benef it from addressing this problem today?\"), and expecta tions (e.g. \"What types of things do you feel we might do to help you with this problem?\") (6 ) Module 9 discusses \"understanding the patient's perspective\" in greater depth. It is helpful to cultivate the skills of attending to patients' cues and clues, and f ollowing up with nonjudgmental and respectful f urther inquiry. For exa mple, very often people mention \"stress,\" or say a t an odd point, \"My uncle (neighbor, friend, etc) had liver cancer,\" without f urther elabora tion. They are not sure you will be interested, or worried that you will think their concern unimportant. If you miss the cue, they may feel ignored, and trust in the relationship will be a little (or a lot, depending on details) eroded. Asking how the stress has been af fecting them, both physically and emotionally, and whether or not it impacts their normal activities; or why they brought up the uncle just now may reveal infor mation that enables you to minimize tests a nd consultations, and save time, a nd foster the healing relationship. Psychiatric illness Dissociation from f eelings, treating people as objects and feeling ineffective a re the usual symptoms of burnout. Importantly, the responses to clues sometimes help point toward the need for a diagnostic assessment f or a mood or a nxiety disorder. Other clues that suggest that patients should be screened f or depression (see module 27) or anxiety (see module 26) before f urther workup f or obscure or unlikely somatic diseases include the following: patients who appea r sad, agitated, or anxiouspatients with three or more unrelated somatic symptoms patients with nonspecific symptoms like decreased energy, headache, or fatigue that do not relate to other somatic symptoms or physical findings; or with chronic abdominal pain and a negative workup patients whose symptoms a re out of proportion to their objective findings patients who f ail to improve as expected patients who f ail to adhere to agreed management plans While it is important for you to understand your patients' problems and their perspective on these problems, it ma y be just as importa nt to communicate this understanding to your patients. Without doing this, your patients may not apprecia te that you have understood the nature and the severity of their problems or their concerns, goals, and expect ations about them. You can communicate your understanding by brief ly reviewing what you have learned and by expressing empathy (i.e. I can understand how difficult this must be f or you) and legitimation (i.e. given this circumstance, it is normal to feel the way you have been feeling.). Create t rust and co nfidence Patients' positive health outcomes strongly correlate with high levels of trust in their clinicians. This is probably because trusting patients both follow pla ns they feel involved in generating and also feel empowered to ask questions when uncertain or worried.(7 ) Patients with greater trust in their clinicians are more satisfied with their care, more likely to adhere to their clinician' s recommendations, and less likely to change clinicia ns. Trust comes from the successful a ccomplishment of many of the tasks in the therapeutic process -\u00ad for example, understanding patients a nd their problems, demonstrating interest and concern and informing and involving patie nts' in the decision making process. One study tha t supports this idea surveyed patients who had a first visit with a cardiologist, neurologist, nephrologist, ga stroenterologist, or rheumatologist at a Harva rd medical school fa culty practice. (8 ) In this study, 79% of patients reported complete confidence and trust in the specia list. Patients who were more trusting reported that specialists listened, gave as much information as patients wa nted, instructed patients about what to do if problems or symptoms continued, got worse, or returned, involved patients in decisions as much as patients wa nted, and spent as much time as patients wanted. Patients highly value clinicians who outline management options, explain the risks and benef its of each option, and of fer patients opportunities to participa te in decisions about their care. Patients a nd clinicians should be clear about the goals of care and these goals must be realistic. Patients understand that not every diagnosis is accurate and not every treatment works, so they want to know how to monitor their course and what to do if things don' t go a s expected. Establishing this type of safety net greatly enhances trust. Demo nstrating Interest and Concern Making obvious your interest in the patient as a special person is the central task in establishing a healing and therapeutic relationship. Patients are more trusting, cooperative and satisfied; and your work is simpler, more efficient, time ly, accura te and satisfying. Giving attention to enhancing your relationships with patients results in more trust, more optimism about plans and better adherence to them, easier resolution of conflicts, and more open and f rank discussion of difficult topics, such as bad news, sexual problems, or post-\u00adopera tive complica tions. Patients are more satisfied, your work is more efficient and malpractice suit s less likely. For many patients, your personal attention imparts a refreshing boost in self-\u00adesteem, so central to getting on with life. We briefly review the skills f or accomplishing this central task. More depth and additionalstrategies a re presented in Module 6. Demonstrate your interest by spending a few moments a t each visit getting to know your patients' social situations, job, hobbies and interests. Engaging in this more personal relationship not only makes your work easier (as above), but it reminds you that you are taking care of a person not simply another \"case\" of hypertension. Use multiple strategies to demo nstrate concern Commit yourself to express ing your interest verbally, non-\u00adverbally and in small gestures. Display your commitment to patients by going out of your way to provide services that are not strictly required. For example, communicate results of tests in a timely manner, call to see if they are feeling better or have quit smoking. Such simple gestures can easily become part of your routine, and patients apprecia te these expressions of your concern f or their well-\u00adbeing. Communicate your interest directly by expressing support and partnership in difficult situations. For example, if you determine tha t a patient has depression, but is not willing to accept treatment, you can communicate your support by saying, \"I am interested in helping you, even thoug h you are not ready to do anything right now. Come in any time you wish and we can figure out together how to help you feel better.\" Express your interest non-\u00adverbally as well. For example, in hospital you can sit down at the bedside. Taking a moment to pull up a chair, a nd maintaining eye conta ct revea ls your concern, whereas standing up creates the impression that you wish to leave a s soon as possible. Module 14 describes additional non-\u00adverbal skills that communicate concern. Informing and Invo lving Patients in their Care Information about a patient's disease and its management can be helpful or overwhelming, and is easily f orgotten. Tailor the information you provide so that it enables patients to understand diagnosis and ma nagement plans. Encourage patients to participate as much (or as little) as they like in their own care. Providing informa tion about patients' disease an d its management (see Module 10) ca n relieve anxiety, promote greater a dherence to the management plan, and increase patient satisfaction. Patient educa tion also enables patients to monitor their treatment outcomes and appropriately respond if they fa il to improve as expected. Informed patients can more easily play an active role in decisions about their care. The process of educating patients begins with an assessment of their belief s, concerns, and need for information. (9) All patients wa nt to know their diagnosis and management plan, but not all wa nt to understand the pathophysiology or the pharmacology of their medications. Some patients cope with stressf ul situations by monitoring their environment for information about that situation. More informa tion is comforting, even though it may not enable them to do anything dif ferently. Other patients prefer not to focus on gathering more inf ormation, because going beyond just the basic information provokes additional stress. Never a ssume that patients will understand, believe, or remember what you tell them. Evidence shows that patients do not understand (or forget) about half of what you tell them. You can increase their understanding and adherence to management recommendations by providing themwith educa tional handouts, by writing down the things you both agree that they will do, and by asking them to review what they have learned and what they plan to do as a result of your discussion. The skills and strategies a re described in Modules 11 a nd 12. Provide suppo rtive counseling Counseling interventions to help people cope with health problems and to help them f ollow plans are among the most cost-\u00adef fective things a clinicia n can do to prevent disease and improve health status. Supportiv e counseling helps pa tients change unhealthy behaviors, and helps them cope more effectively with health problems or stressful life events. Counseling goes well beyond providing information, but giving information skillfully is the f oundation of excellent supportive counseling. Counseling is an interactive process that includes a ssessing patients' perceptions and self-\u00adef ficacy, attentive listening about values, priorities and goals, problem-\u00adsolving about barriers and obstacles, and rea ching a greement on negotia ted goals (as opposed to your prescribing the goals). Aspects of counseling are given more space in Module 16 and other modules that discuss specific problems (such as alcohol, sex, end-\u00adof -\u00adlife care, talking about mista kes.) Stress Management Patients wa nt clinicians to help with psychologic al distress. Discussion and ventilation with an attentive listener helps. Clinicians who add empathic statements increase their ability to decrease emotiona l distress. About 60% of primary care patients indica te that it is at least somewhat important that clinicians help them with their psychologica l distress. Most patients seek an opportunity to discuss the stress in their lives. (10) Effective approaches can be applied during a medica l encounter, despite the limited time of visits. (11) Discussing the stress in the patient' s life and encouraging emotional expression can have considerable therapeutic va lue. (12 ) Talking about a stressful situation with an attentive and reflective listener encourages pa tients to examine situations more carefully, and they ma y recognize that things are not as dismal as imagined. Simple ventilation of strong emotions to a nonjudgmental listener often provides relief. This activity enhances trust and prepa res the ground for additional a ssistance, as the patient senses that \"my doctor cares about me.\" The therapeutic benefits of simple discussion and ventilation are enhanced when clinicians demonstrate their caring by making reflective statements (e.g. \"I see that this is very difficult for you\"), legit imation (e.g. \"it is normal to feel the way you do\"), suppo rt (e.g. \"I am here to help in whatever way I can\"), partnership (e.g. \"we can f igure out how to dea l with this toge ther\"), and respect (e.g. \"I am impressed by your clear thinking a bout this problem\"). (See Module 6) Decide what you might do in additio n to listening Broadly speaking, deciding whether patients need help with problem solving, changing their thinking about distress, or discovering ways to better cope helps you organize your interventions. As you listen to the details, you should decide whether patient s need help with problem solving,modif ying negative cognitions about themselves a nd/or their problem, or finding adequate coping strategies. Problem solving includes severa l discrete steps: help patients identify goals (e.g. how will they benef it if they can change a stressful situation); brainsto rm possible approaches and their likely outcomes; explore barriers to implementing these approaches; select an approa ch and develop an implementatio n plan; and mo nitor progress and outcomes. Your role in this process is primarily to guide pa tients in organizing their thinking and strategy, and working out each step by asking them questions (e.g. \"what are the ways you have thought about to resolve this problem?\") You may provide options or suggestions, but ultimately, patients must make the hard choices themselves about the best course of action. Help pat ients change t heir perspective People who change how they view problems reduce their distress without changing the situation itself. You can help patients explore their attributions of causality and of the potential for relief, and help them examine which specific life functions are actually disturbed. Many stressf ul problems can't be resolved, but you can help reduce patients' distress through helping change patients' thoughts (\"cognitions\") associated with these problems. Pati ents who make internal attributions about the cause of the problem (e.g. \"I did this to myself ; I caused this\") experience more distress. Patients who also make stable attribution about its cause (e.g. \"it will never get better\") and global attributions (e.g. \"it affects everything about me\") compound their distress. These patients, who persistently believe tha t they are guilty or a failure, or that t he inevitable result of a situations is complete disaster ca n be encouraged to more critically evaluate their belief s. In addition to attentive and empathic listening, you can a sk patients to ref lect on why they are making these attributions, whether a ny evidence supports the attributions, and what other attributions about causes a nd effects might be possible. Many clinicia ns make the mistake of trying to reason with patients and persuade them that their thinking is incorrect. The dynamics of cognitive thinking predict that you will always fail t o persuade; you can only assist patients in organizing their reflections on their cognitions, and coming to their own conclusions. Suggest additio nal simple co ping strategies Additionally, clinicians ca n help pa tients adjust expectations, engage in rewardi ng activities, and make use of support networks. Clinicians ca n suggest strategies that will help pa tients cope more effectively, whether or not they plan to seek resolution of the problem or a djust their cognitions. One tactic is to encourage patients to readjust their expectations. Distress can be envisaged as the gap between expectations and reality. When problem solving f ails to modify the reality and bring the situation more in line with expectations, you can help pa tients close the gap by rea djusting their expectat ions. A second tactic is to encourage patients to more frequently engage in activities that are pleasurable, relaxing, or rewarding. Positive activities provide things to look forward to and def lect attention away f rom the negative situations, a kind of counterweight that bala nces a gainst stressf ul problems. A third tactic is to encourage patients to take better a dvantage of their social support network. You can ask patients to identif y the people in their life that they turn to for support. Sometimes patients have not shared their problems with f amily and friends, and need your encouragement to do so and to accept their support. We stress a gain that you canno t persuade patients to do any of these things, but when you present your ideas and suggestions in an empathic way that encourages ref lection and dialog, you will have a positive ef fect.Provisio n of effective reassurance abo ut health concerns Health concerns ca use stress. Patients often seek ca re primarily for reassurance about these concerns. Your full a nd empathic evaluation of the problem (even problems tha t seem biologically very minor) and the belief s and concerns f orms the firm foundation for reassurance. (13) The vast majority of patients with minor problems like an upper respira tory tract infection do not seek ca re. Those who do are usually more worried than patients who decide to manage the problem on their own. Ask questions like, \"What have you thought these symptoms might be due to?\" Patients' answers will alert you to their might desire f or reassurance and give you information about their specific c oncern. (see Module 9) When your initial impression is that reassurance would be appropriate, strive to more fully understand the basis of the concerns. Ask, \"What makes you think this may be a serious problem?\" and \"What worries you the most about this problem?\" Patients will not accept reassuring statements unless they believe that you fully understand that their symptoms are distressing and complex and mystifying. Consequently, giving them time and prompts to fully express their symptoms, and then expressing your understanding by summarizing what you have heard and making a n empathic statement (e.g. I can really understa nd how difficult these symptoms must be f or you) not only gives you importa nt data about the situation, but forms the foundation for effective reassurance. (See Module 8) After you complete these explora tions a nd show your understanding, educa ting patients corrects erroneous belief s and provides the rationale f or your conclusions and rea ssurance. (see Module 10) D iscuss with patients about indications that a reevaluation or a change in management might be in order. We can with full confidence tell a patient that her headaches do not indicate or mask a more serious hidden probl em, but we can rarely be one hundred percent certain about this. Patients appreciate a list of specific f indings they can use to determine if further evaluation is indicated. In this situa tion, you might tell her to come back for additional examination if the headaches increase in frequency or severity, fail to improve over the next two weeks, or wake her from sleep. When yo u must temper yo ur reassuran ce, o r it is rejected by patient s Some patients accept your rationale and rea ssurance but others do not. The only way you can determine which patients are reassured is to ask them. You can a sk, \"How worried are you now?\" a nd, \"Are you thinking we should do additional tests at this time?\" If patients still desire diagnostic tests, you can choose to perform tests if risks and costs are minimal and you t hink that the therapeutic benefit of the reassurance will be substantial. B ecause the therapeutic benef it is usually small and alwa ys hard to predict, you better serve your patients by giving a clear rationale f or not testing, responding to their feelings (see Module 13) with empathy and support about the \"bad news\" (see Module 33) that you will not test right now, and negotiating a mutually agreeable follow up pla n. (see Module 11) Sometimes patients' concerns are appropriate to the potential seriousness of their problem. D o not provide f alse reassurance, a nd also do not discuss all the potential consequences until you are more certain of the outlook. To the degree that is realistic, your most important function is to be clear that optimism and hope are in order. The hope you provide should be con sistent with a realistic set of goals. D o not raise the hope of patients with metastatic cancer that they will liveanother X years, but reassure them that they will not experience much pain and that with your support, they will remain in control of decisions about their care. (See Module 34) Expressing your compassion and your ongoing persona l support (\"non-\u00adaba ndonment,\" see Module 33) is in itself a way to increase patients' hope. Modifying maladaptive and unhealt hy behaviors You can help patients change unhealthy behaviors, and make a big difference in their current and future health. There are helpful concepts, and a number of skills that you can learn that will promote beha vior change. Many major health problems result from unhealthy or malada ptive individual beha viors that are of complex origin and extremely resista nt to change. These include smoking, drinking, drug abuse, gambling, a nd domestic violence, to name a few. You may find it hard to understand why patients do not follow plans they have a greed to-\u00ad they often do not keep appointments or see consultants, fail to take medications or accept your recommendations f or procedures. You can learn specif ic skills f or assisting with behavior change. Promoting behavioral change is presented f ully in module 16 and counseling related to specif ic behaviors is discussed in module 24 (smoking cessation), 25 (diet and exercise), 29 (alcoholism), and 30 (drug abuse). In this section we summarize essential points of counseling f or behavior change. Your initial challenge is to establish a strong relationship with patients, a nd then to develop the skills for quality patient education, exploration of motiva tional f actors and appropriate counseling strategies. It is important to preserve this relationship by not being judgmenta l or threatening when discuss ing the need to modify a patient's behavior. Avoid lecturing patients about the adverse consequences of their beha vior, since most patients will already know much of this information. It is usually much more effective to begin by empathizing with the dif ficulty of changing behavior and then to ask patients what they see a s the benefits to them, if they were able to change the beha vior, and then to assess their level of motivation to change their behavior at this time. Patients who a re not ready to change their beha vior will need motiva tional counseling. Two types of issues can prevent patients from being ready to make the effort to change a maladaptive behavior. First, they might not fully comprehend the risks associated with that behavior and the benef its of changing it. In addressing this issue, you should remember to take advanta ge of the teachable moment (i.e. any time the patient is already experiencing an adverse consequence of the behavior you wish to change). You can highlight the relationship between this behavior and this problem. B efore adding more reasons why the patient should change their behavior, ask the patient about their understa nding of the current and future consequences of this behavior and the benef its of changing it. This type of information will be more persuasive if the patient says it rather than if you say it. In discussing the benefits of changing the behavior, it is often more effective to emphasize more immediate benefits (like saving money if you quit smoking) then the more remote benef its that won' t happen f or a long time and don' t happen to everyone. Patient s often f ully understand the need to change their behavior, but still seem reluctant to try to attempt to do so. This is usually beca use they don't think they will succeed if they try. For them, the barriers to change are perceived as too great. This, therefore, is the second issue that needs to be addressed. The key question to ask is \"What makes cha nging this behavior hard f or you?\" Once you underst and their barriers to change, you can begin to help your patients develop a plan to overcome their ba rriers. In developing this pla n, severa l principles must be kept in mind. First, try not to tell patients what to do to overcome their barriers, but rather help them f igure this out for themselves. Sometimes it is necessary to provide patients with options, but after listing a f ew strategies they might employ, it is important to ask if any of these strategies sound like they might work for them. The second principle is to keep the plan simple. If it sounds too difficult, patientswon't try to do it. For exa mple, if you tell a patient who is concerned about weight gain if they try to quit smoking that they can overcome this barrier by exercising, the patient is likely to conclude, \"why bother? It is hard enough to try to quit smoking. I don't think I will be able to also start an exercise program.\" The third principle is, make the pla n as specific as possible. Telling a patient that they should diet a nd exercise, will have little meaning and eff ect, unless you can negotiate specific cha nges in the patient' s eating habits and a specific plan to exercise that includes the type of exercise, frequency, and duration. You can a lso increase your patients' sense of control over the target behavior by discussing the reasons why you believe they can be successf ul, if they try. You might mention other successes the patient has achieved, your support for this effort, and the plan you will develop together. If the patient has tried to change their behavior in the past, you can explain tha t behavior change often involves severa l unsuccessful ef forts before you finally succeed. Each time you try however, you can learn something f rom that effort that will help you the next time you try to change your behavior. You can then review wha t patients have learned f rom previous efforts to change their behavior and what they can do differently this time. The more confidence patients have about their chances to succeed, the more motiva ted they will be to try to change their behavior. When developing a behavioral change plan, several issues should be addressed. First, the goals should be explicit and rea listic. Patients should not be merely told to lose weight, but should be informed that an appropriate initial goal might be to lose 5% to 10% of their body weight since this will achieve most of the medical benef its from weight loss. Second you should ask the patient to set a behavioral change date. This will provide structure a nd let you know when to see them in follow-\u00adup (usually one to two weeks following this date). Third, you need to help the pa tient create an environment that will sup port their eff ort to change their beha vior. For cigarette smokers for example, this means getting rid of cigarettes, ashtrays, and lighters a nd telling everyone they know in advance, that they are quitting and tha t the cigarette smokers can help them by not smoking in front of them and not giving them any cigarettes. Third, you should help the patient identify their barriers to change and the things t hat trigger the maladaptive beha vior and then develop a plan to overcome their barriers and either avoid their triggers or not succumb, if they are exposed to them. Fourth, the behaviora l change pla n should include rewards that highlight the benef its of their ef forts. Patients who quit smoking can gain a greater appreciation of the financial benef its of smoking cessation by setting aside the money the y would have spent on buying cigarettes and using that money every week to reward themselves. Fifth, patients should be encouraged to identify people who can support their efforts to change their beha vior and to use them as needed. Finally, the plan should include ongoing follow-\u00adup and monitoring in the clinician' s office and possibly in a community based program. CONCLUSION Health problems and their a ssociated symptoms develop out of a complex process that not only includes biologica l factors, but also patients' belief s, feelings and behaviors and the interpersonal and intrapersonal factors that can af fect them. Bio-\u00adtechnical interventions can modif y the underlying somatic alterations that contribute to these health problems. The belief s, concerns, emotional distress, and behaviors are most eff ectively addressed in trusting and supportive relationship with the clinicia n, through communica tion about the issues. The therapeutic value of the encounter itself can be maximized by focusing on six essential tasks: striving to fully understanding patients and their health problems building trust and confidence demonstrating interest and concern informing patients f ully, and involving patients in their own care providing counseling to relieve stress a nd health concerns and modify maladaptive beha viors demonstrating support and respect even in difficult circumstancesA variety of cognitive, a ffective, and beha vioral strategies are suitable and ava ilable to accomplish each of these tasks. The effective application of these strategies will lead not only to improved outcomes of care, but a lso to increased professional satisfaction a nd practice growth and a decreased risk of malpractice litigation.

Video A ssoc. -\u00ad 6/27/2005 Relevance Medical educa tion and the medical profession are stressful endeavors, with high rates of burnout and mental health problems, including substance a buse. We will be satisfied and effective clinicia ns only if we find healthy methods f or coping with stress. We cannot reach our potential as healers if we ourselves are unhealthy in body, mind or spirit. We cannot be fully present for our patients or colleagues if we are depressed, anxious, or distra cted by personal problems. In this module we explore the landsca pe of personality, study, and demanding professiona l work through three stories. We examine ways that Jill, a medical student; B ill, a resident; a nd Lisa, a young practicing clinician, strive to find and sustain professiona l satisfaction and persona l well-\u00ad being. Personal issues and challenges at each stage of professiona l development are different but overlapping. Jim, B ill and Lisa each cope with stresses and grow personally and professionally through engaging in persona l reflection and seeking counsel. We comment on psychological and social factors that influence their att itudes and behaviors, and on the healthy choices and strategies they develop to align their actions with the values they cherish. Questio ns fo r Reflect ion: Do you have a mentor at the present time? If not, with whom might you explore and discuss opportunities and barriers to finding someone to fill this role? Do you regularly keep a journa l, or in some other way incorporate a regular time of reflection or contemplation into your day (week?)Do you have a ny routine rituals or practices that help you center yourself and be present to the moment, especia lly when you are working hard? Do you regularly schedule time off from work/ study activities? When have you been at your best\u2014thriving persona lly, energetic, satisfied with life, and hopeful of your future? What did you learn from this experience tha t has releva nce for your f uture well-\u00adbeing? Do you disclose your feelings to your intimate pa rtner? Your friends? Your colleagues or teammates? Is it difficult or ea sy for you to make empathic statements? What positive influence could you have on the nature of your learning or work environment? How do you care for your physical health-\u00addo you attend to nutrition, exercise, and sleep? What about a lcohol, recreational drugs, or tobacco? D o you have your own primary care clinician? Key Principles: Well-\u00adbeing is at the positive end of a continuum of life satisfaction that includes burnout at the negative pole. Many clinician chara cteristics that lead to success in work have the potential to limit well-\u00ad being. Burnout begins early, erodes the soul, and requires intentional intervention f or prevention or recovery. Successful strategies f or building and sustaining well-\u00adbeing include reframing experience, reflecting on experience, mindfully attending to work experiences, and honoring deeply held values. Building intimacy with f riends and partners requires self-\u00addisclosure of feelings, dilemmas and conflicts. Professionals have a responsibility to foster the well-\u00adbeing of their friends and pa rtners, colleagues and workplaces and even the pla net earth. Learning go als: At completion of this module, you will be able to: Describe common clinician chara cteristics that may contribute to unhealthy persona l belief s, behaviors, and habits. Describe common causes a nd manifestations of professiona l burnout. Describe healthy cognitive, emotional, and behaviora l practices that can promote yourwell-\u00adbeing and sustain you throughout a career in medicine. Describe 3 changes in attitude, behavior or practice you could make that would improve or sustain your well-\u00adbeing. Disclose these changes and discuss their importa nce and potential barriers to their implementation with 2 important people in your life. Discuss why clinician well-\u00adbeing results in improved relationships a nd outcomes. THE LANDSCAPE: PERSONALITY AND STUDY In the first section of this module you'll find the following: The Impo ster syndro me: am I good eno ugh? Certain marker events in training\u2014such a s medical school graduation, becoming a senior resident, finishing residency, starting a first job\u2014can lead to an inner expectation of competence that is not congruent with our own self-\u00addoubts. Case: Jill, a medical student Doing \"only\" moderately well while constantly studying and working f eels inadequate when compared with carefree college days a t the head of the class. Compulsivity is a no rmal clinician trait Clinician compulsivity, with characteristic doubts, guilt a nd an exaggerated sense of responsibility, produces benefits for patients, but if unbalanced, ca n produce fatigue, cynicism and isolation in us. The \"Hidden Curriculum\" The internal linking of exceptional performance and achievement with personal worth is a chara cteristic learned early by hard working people, and an impossible standard for medical students. The Impo ster Syndrome: am I go od eno ugh? Certain marker events in training\u2014such as medical school graduation, becoming a senior resident, finishing residency, starting a first job\u2014can lead to an inner expectatio n of competence that is not congruent with our own self-\u00addoubts. Many clinicians suffer from a n \"imposter syndrome\" in the early stages of their ca reer. They feel their outward appearance of competence is discrepant with their inner insecurity. They are concerned that they might be \"unmasked\" at any time. They keep their insecurity private, leading to a skewed perception that they lag behind their peers in competence. Case: Jill, a medical student Doing \"only\" moderately well while constantly studying and working feels inadequate when compared with carefree college days at the head of the class. Jill Rayburn wondered if she would ever ha ve fun again. She studied for her pathophysiology exa m for a week, hadn't slept in 30 hours and still felt ill prepared. She wondered whether she was cut out for medicine, in spite of being in the upper 20% of her class. Many classmates seemed unthrea tened by the mountain of material to be mastered for this exam, a nd some had even gone for a hike yesterday. Last night Jill declined an invita tion to play indoor soccer. She was beginning to resent the professor who invited her to co-\u00adauthor a paper, even though she felt flattered and honored to be singled out. Now she didn't f eel up to working on the paper, and wished she'd started prepa ring for this exam earlier. She remembered many caref ree days in high school and colleg e, when she was consistently at the top of her class. What had happened to that teenag er with the sense of humor and time to hang out with friends? Looking ahead to the remainder of the winter, she saw no respite, only more dea dlines and lonely days in the library. Compulsivity is a norm al clinician t rait Clinician compulsivity, with characteristic doubts, guilt a nd an exaggerated sense of responsibility, produces benefits for patients, but if unbalanced, can produce fatigue, cynicism and isolation in clinicians. Compulsivity, with its benef icial attributes of thoroughness, accura cy, second guessing, and monitoring changes, is a common clinician habit. Compulsivity contributes to suc cess in getting into medical school, completing training a nd high quality patient care. If not balanced through reflection and non-\u00adcompulsive activities, however, this habit erodes clinicians' well-\u00adbeing. Jill ma nifests many aspects of compulsivity that can trigger cynicism and burnout by the time she is a resident. For example, she doubts her competence, in spite of evidence of excellent performance. She assesses her progress in ref erence to the perceived mastery of her peers, and in her fatigue cannot imagine attaining success in medicine. J ill will become dysfunctional if this neurotic thinking progresses into the \"imposter syndrome,\" in which she feels she somehow fools others into thinking she is competent, while the threat of being unmasked lurks at every turn. Additionally, J ill feels guilt about unwise alloca tion of her time, as no matter how hard she has worked, it does not seem to be enough. In addition to self-\u00addoubt and guilt, Jill also ca rries a burden of responsibility for meeting deadlines and obligations, and f eels alone with tha t burden. She wonders about her peers' enjoying an outing together and envisions her own continued isolation in the library. This triad of doubt, guilt, and an exaggerated sense of responsibility a re well-\u00addescribed as constituents of the \"normal\" compulsivity trait in clinicians.(1 ) In summary, the triad of compulsive behaviors that lead to overwork a nd burnout are the following: Doubt (\"Ma ybe I missed something.\") Guilt (\"No matter how hard I've worked, it's not enough.\") Exaggerated sense of responsibility (\"It' s all on my shoulders.\") Compulsivity is one of the traits tha t can lead to a \"psychology of postponement\" that avoids honoring the important va lues and relationships in our lives. (2 ) \"Psycholo gy of postponement\" Postponing relaxa tion, sleep and relationships begins early and can become habitual, and one consequence of this habit is that life may seem not worth living. In the back of our minds we may have the nagging thought that this overwork is not good for us, that taking care of ourselves by getting enough sleep, exercise, ea ting well, having fun, and spending time with f riends are all important; but in the \"psychology of postponement\"(2 ) we keep thinking, \"As soon as this exam is over, then I can unwind.\" The need to sta y on top of our game, however, multiplies this bargaining with ourselves: \"As soon as I get into the residency I want, then I can relax;\" \"as soon as I get accepted f or a fellowship, then I can start working out;\" \"as soon as I start my first real job, then I can have a life.\" Thus early in medical training a habit o f postponement can develop tha t if unchecked can lead to neglecting many of our most va lued relationships and activities throughout our career. Sir William Osler, in a commencement address to graduating medical students in 1889, had these words to say about postponement: \"Engro ssed lat e and so on in pro fessional cares...you may so lay wast e that you may find, t oo late, with hearts given way, that there is no place in yo ur habit -\u00adstricken so uls for tho se gentler influences which make life worth living.\"(3 ) The \"Hidden Curriculum\" The internal linking of exceptional performance and achievement with personal worth is a chara cteristic learned early by hard working people, and an impossible standard for medical students. Jill's torment has its roots in the early conditioning of many bright young people in American society, and medical schools exaggerate this chara cteristic as part of the \"hidden curriculum .\" We assimilated the message that our worth as persons is linked to academic success or outward performance. The need for love and acceptance is inherent in being huma n, and children who are repeatedly told they are valued only when they are \"exceptional\" link personal worth to meeting extraordina ry standards. The achievement standa rd accompanies many students into medica l school a nd collides with the reality that their peers are also top perf ormers. They construe fa ilure to stand out as failing to meet an essential marker of worthiness. We can choose to back off from overwork and carry the self-\u00adstigma of being \"ordinary,\" and unconsciously f eel less lovable; or choose to work harder to stand out. Paradoxically, striving to \"stand out\" can lead to the very isolation and loneliness f rom which we ar e trying to escape. The hidden curriculum also interacts with our need to conform to group norms. Our need to \"fit in\" mirrors the power of our drive to \"stand out.\" The new science of interpersonal neurobiology shows that we are wired to belong to groups; when we feel we belong brain opiate levels increase. Conversely the perception of being at risk for alienation f rom the group correlates with opiate decrements.4 This neurochemistry may produce \"groupthink\" and reluctance to question the group's direction. If group norms tend to move us in wa ys that run counter to our values or diminish our health and well-\u00adbeing or that of others, it can require a heroic level of a ssertiveness to challenge them. (see \"workpla ce health\" et. seq., below) Hidden curriculum effects -\u00ad insidio us and pervasive S tudents and faculty are trapped by the effects of rewarding overwork. Jill's story also illustrates the insidious manner in which the system of medical educa tion with its overt and covert rewards and punishments can reinforce inherent compulsivity. Her exceptionalperformance was noticed by one of her professors, who asked her to co-\u00adauthor a paper. It is natural f or teachers to ask top performers to do more, yet neither the tea cher nor the student pauses to reflect on the potential toxicity of rewarding overwork. Medical school traditiona lly is good at channeling students into ever refined strata of academic a nd professional success, but not so good at mentoring them into building a career in which their professional endeavors unfold within a context of a healthy life well lived. Unless Jill were to encounter a mentor that has this broader grasp of personal and professional well-\u00adbeing, her role models and professors will continue unwittingly to provide a \"hidden curriculum,\" in which being a successful clinician entails putting one's own life on hold. Hidden curriculum makes capable st udents feel unwo rthy The \"hidden curriculum\" in medicine tea ches that success as a clinician entails suspending any ef fort to balance your own life. Not all worthy, capable students can be at the top of the class. The hidden curriculum insidiously leads students away f rom taking care of their own health It promotes unhealthy behaviors that students may observe in f aculty members and other role models. It encourages faculty and peers to reward overwork with acknowledgment and praise. Some people successfully counteract the insidious effects of the hidden curriculum. Look toward faculty members and mentors who intentionally seek balance in their personal and professiona l lives to help you thwart these pressures. Jill meets a mento r Guidance from an experienced faculty member ca n counter eff ects of the hidden curriculum. Dr. Ann Benning ton, a teacher from a class on the medical interview, noticed Jill's hunched posture and drawn facial expression. \"Jill, you look like you have the weight of the world on your shoulders. How are you doing?\" J ill managed a smile and protested, \"I' m fine. I just finished the pathophys exa m.\" Ann confronted her mildly, \"Well you look exhausted. When' s the last time y ou had an evening off ?\" When she noticed a tear f orming, Ann replied, \"Jill, I suspect you' re carrying more of a burden than you let on.\" She suggested they meet that a fternoon. At the meeting in Dr. B enning ton's office, Jill slowly opened up with the self-\u00addoubt, emptiness, fatigue, and isolation she was feeling. Ann replied, \"You know, J ill, you remind me of myself when I was a medical student.\" Noticing Jill's tears, she continued, \"The fact that you are one of the brightest people in your class doesn' t seem to matter to you now. Like me you are a perf ectionist, and one effect of that perfectionism is that we don't feel we can get enough external valida tion for our worth. That's because we weren't taught to value ourselves from within, to know that we have immense worth before we ever set out to do great things.\" She paused to observe Jill's response. Since she was breathing more freely and seemed curious, Ann continued: \"Striving f or excellence is not wrong , and is in f act desirable. B ut what we mean by 'excellence' needs to be challeng ed. Your work will always occur within a real world context of the values you hold and commitments you make, as well a s the limitations of time, personal energy, and competing tasks. B umping up against these limits can be humbling, but ultimately a ccepting those limits and accepting your gif ts will give you some freedom. Your body, mind and spirit are giving you feedback that you shouldn't ignore. To the extent you can let your a wareness of the origin of this pain lead you to greater self-\u00ad acceptance, you will be an excellent clinician and a healing presen ce for others.\"Appreciat ing Versus Judging and Evaluating The deleterious ef fects of \"judgment\" can be counterbalanced by cultivating \"appreciation.\" Judging and evaluating ourselves is a necessa ry component of improvement, but it can overwhelm apprecia ting ourselves. We are better at a ppreciating beauty in art and nature than we are at apprecia ting ourselves as persons. Building a habit of self-\u00adappreciation might include journaling a bout personal successes, allowing compliments to sink in, sharing our sa tisfactions with others, and cultiva ting present-\u00admoment, sensory a wareness. We are \"becoming\", no t yet \"t here\" Apprecia ting who we are instead of judging wha t we are not yet reminds us that we are \"becoming.\" Among perspectives worth cultivating in the pursuit of wel l-\u00adbeing is the awareness that lack of perfection is an inherent part of the lengthy process of becoming a clinician. It is helpful to think of ourselves as \"becoming\" rather than insisting on holding an image of what we are not yet, and then unfavorably comparing ourselves to that image. The pressures inherent in medical training to continuously evaluate performance and judge one's own competence a re oppressive, and can be balanced through cultiva tion of the capacity for \"appreciation.\" When we respond to a sunset, to the first flower blooming in the garden in spring, or to the final movement of Beethoven's 9th Symphony, this is typically not an act of judgment, but one of apprecia tion. We do not exercise the \"judgment\" and \"appreciation\" centers of our minds at the same time. A n example of this t ension was illustrated in a spiritual retrea t. Participants on the retrea t were asked to spend two hours one afternoon in silence, without books or other cognitive distractions, simply a ttending to what they observed through their senses. One clinician reported he spent two hours watching a caterpillar on the ground, wondering what led it to choose one direction over another. When the caterpillar arrived at a road, he debated with himself whether he should help it across the road or not. The group was moved by his story and shared their appreciation with him. In the post-\u00adretrea t evaluation he wrote the f ollowing: \"I didn't understa nd why it was such a big deal. But I started to think more a bout it\u2014the f eeling of wonder, suspension of judgment, trying to help but not being sure if I was being helpf ul. I'm good at feeling wonder about people and nature. I need to be better at f eeling wonder and joy when pondering and observing me.\" Collabo ratio n is an essent ial competency. Cultivate the pract ice of wo rking co operatively. Clinicians are always part of a team working on beha lf of their patients; whether in the hospital, the operating room or the off ice. Learning to collaborate as a member of a tea m countera cts an exa ggera ted sense of personal responsibility, and committing yourself to working coopera tively reduces isolation and mitigates the harmful effects of competitiveness on your health and well-\u00adbeing.The competition to get into medical school and advance through training reinforces an exaggerated sense of personal responsibility. This attitude is too frequently carried forward into subsequent practice, in which the illusion is maintained tha t you are a self -\u00adsufficient professional, that asking for help is a sign of weakness, and tha t competency is distinguished by your ability to \"go it alone.\" No thing could be f urther from the wa y health care is actually delivered. Systematic attempts to improve quality and reduce error demand that teams of professionals f rom various disciplines work cooperatively to provide patient ca re and promote the health of the community. The best medical schools are training f or this, a nd the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) states that \"syst ems-\u00adbased practice\" and \"professionalism,\" which involve working as part of a team, are core competencies to be ma stered during residency. Whether or not teamwork is reinf orced by your medical school or residency, cultivating the practice of working cooperatively with others and committing yourself to helping colleagues succeed can contribute enormously to your personal and professional satisfaction. Reinforcing a mat uring value st ructure A mentor guides through dialog and by example. Jill's encounters with D r. Bennington, along with Ann' s willingness to discuss the importance of honoring life values, show that senior clinicians who have struggled to attain life wisdom can exert a powerful influence toward reversing the effects of the hidden curriculum. In choosing mentors, students would do well to seek out clinicians who tolerate the tension of keeping a balance in their personal and professional lives and explicitly honor and value f amily relationships, f riendships, recreational pursuits, hobbies, a nd persona l self-\u00adca re. In April of her 4th year of medical school Jill dropped by Dr. B ennington's office. \"How a re you feeling a bout the match?\" Ann asked. \"Well, to tell you the truth,\" Jill r eplied, \"my initia l first choice was a program where I could have pursued work based on that paper I co-\u00adauthored. S ince the match, however, I've thought more about the program I' m going to, and especially about one faculty member who interviewed me. I was struck by his family pictures, his children' s poems and drawings, and his sharing with me how much their training progra m valued both professiona lism and the personal growth a nd life satisfaction of their residents.\" \"I'm glad I picked this program!\" Later, Jill sent Ann a note that read, \"Thank you for reaching out to me at a critical moment, and helping me realize there was more to me than trying to be a star. You helped me value humility, which includes both apprecia tion of what I have to offer and accepta nce of my limitations. You also gave me the great gift of realizing my own capacity for apprecia ting my life a nd for letting that be the ground from which to apprecia te others.\" Dr. Bennington responded with a note that contained this poem by D erek Wolcott tha t you' ll find on the next page. Love After Lo ve By Derek Wolcott The time will come when, with elation you will greet yourself arriving at your own door, in your own mirror, and each will smile at the other' s welcome, and say, sit here. Eat.You will love again the stranger who was yourself . Give wine. Give brea d. Give back your heart to itself, to the stranger who has loved you all your life, whom you ignored for another, who knows you by heart. Take down the love letters from the bookshelf, the photographs, the desperate notes, peel your own image from the mirror. Sit. Feast on your lif e. THE LANDSCAPE: BURNOUT \"Burnout\" results from chronic overwork, avoidance of renewing and energizing a ctivities, and negative self -\u00adjudgment.(5) Burnout is a syndrome to which health care professiona ls are vulnerable. B urnout leads to impaired job perf ormance, health problems, and chemical dependency. It includes the f ollowing components: Emotional exhaustion (compassion f atigue) Depersonaliza tion (treating oneself and others as objects) Perceived clinica l ineff ectiveness (imposter syndrome) Burnout can lead to dissociatio n, deco ntext ualizatio n, and cynicism. In disso ciatio n, we withdraw attention f rom our emotions and somatic sensations, and we exclusively focus visually a nd cognitively on problem-\u00adsolving and our \"to-\u00addo\" list. Deco ntextualizat ion is the habit of thinking of others (and ourselves) in terms of their usefulness in getting our tasks done. They/we are abstracted f rom the full context of life, and become merely tools. Cynicism includes disillusionment about the ideals of service and altruism; our ef forts are futile in the face of illness, death, human failures and meanness. Case: Bill, a resident Bill Trimmell trembled as he sat in the resident' s room wondering why he had raised his voice and scolded his last patient about not doing enough to monitor her blood sugars and for expecting him to keep her pain-\u00adfree. For tunately he had stifled the impulse to unload onto her that he had persistent back pain since a fall, and yet dragged himself to work to take care of whining patients like her. As he elaborated this imaginary conversation, he suddenly asked himself , \"What am I doing?\" This wa s only the second patient of the afternoon, and already he couldn' t wait to go home. His busy morning clinic included two walk-\u00adins and one complex patient with lupus who was 10 minutes late and took an extra 20 minutes, putting him behind and leaving him 10 minutes to lunch on a stale bagel from the morning conference. He was only a third of the way throug h his second year of residency, and found himself resenting many of his patients a nd wondering what had happened to the altruistic dream of helping people that had led him into medical school. Why did he no longer care?Mechanism Burno ut begins early in yo ur career, and erodes yo ur so ul. Dissociation from f eelings, treating people as objects and feeling ineffective a re the usual symptoms of burnout Bill has classica l signs and symptoms of burnout, which consists of emotiona l exhaustion (including compassion fatigue and dissociation f rom feelings in general), depersonalization in relationships (treating oneself, patients, coworkers, a nd family members as objects), and a perceived clinica l ineffectiveness.(5 ) Burnout is described as \"an erosion of the soul\" that sends people into a downward spiral. Burnout may manifest as impaired job perf ormance, sleep disturbance, irritability, marital difficulties, fa tigue, a nxiety, or depression. It can also be associated with poor health, including headaches, hypertension, myocardial infa rction, and chemical dependency. The seeds of burnout are sown in medical schoo l and residency training, where f atigue and emotional exhaustion are often the norm. In mid-\u00adcareer, the reinforcements in the work setting for being a hard worker and placing service to others bef ore self -\u00adcare maintain the momentum of this burgeoning condition. Recovery is diff icult if one remains in the circumstances that generate the symptoms. Cynicism In the absence of thoughtf ul reflection with c olleagues, clinicians develop cynicism a bout the futility of their eff orts to help patients. All too often clinicians are confronted with the reality of patients who are non-\u00ada dherent to medical regimens, or who have chronic hea lth problems that are refractory to all biomedical interventions. Unremitting exposure to cases in which their efforts appear f utile leave clinicians feeling like Sisyphus, who e ndlessly rolled a large stone to the top of a hill, only to have it come tumbling down again. Without the opportunity to discuss these common experiences with peers and f aculty, cynicism about patients and the effectiveness of patient care creeps in. Compassio n fatigue Clinicians constantly in the presence of suffering may become unable to relate to themselves and others as individual persons with a full range of emotions and a unique life context. The relentless parade of human suffering can run our emotional ta nk dry, an experience that is called \"compassion fatigue.\" If we focus cognitively and visually on complex patient care problems or get absorbed in our \"to do\" list in order to survive the days of suffering, disso ciatio n occurs. We withdraw attention f rom our emotions and somatic sensati ons, become anesthetized to feelings and experience dif ficulty connecting with family and friends once we leave work. The cognitive correlate of dissociation is decont extualizatio n. We develop a habit of thinking of others (and even ourselves) in a utilitarian way that abstracts and constructs persons into categories that have usefulness f or our jobs a nd getting tasks done in a timely way. This strate gy ignores the life contexts in which we and others are embedded. We commence relating to patients as diagnoses or appointments on the schedule, to coworkers as facilitating or impeding our work, to family and friends a s intruding or placing unrealistic demands on our time, and to ourselves as task-\u00ad processing machines. Wa rd residents view their work in terms of the tasks involved in admittingand discharging patients, rather tha n in terms of the patient's experience of illness. Af ter several months observing what teams of ward residents did and wha t they communicated among themselves, one medical anthropologist concluded that the job of the ward resident is \"getting rid of patients.\"(6 ) Isolation Perso nal isolatio n is commo n and fosters a sense o f loss of meaning. Community support and ref lection can repair cynicism a nd restore meaning. Carl Rogers once said that \"what is most personal is most universal.\" Nothing ca n be so personally isolating as the perception that one has lost one's way professionally. It is reminiscent of Dante's poigna nt lament at the opening of the D ivine Co medy: \"In the middle of the road o f my life I awoke in a dark woo d where the true way was wholly lo st.\" Nothing can be as healing and reassuring as discovering others who have traveled the same road and emerged as colleagues to admire and emulate. Retreats, support groups, and impromptu sharing of common experiences and struggles during lulls in the pace of work remind us tha t we are part of the huma n community and tha t we have the capacity for renewal and change. Bill understandably feels a disconnect between his previous sense of vocation and the present sense of futility a bout the perceived ineffectiveness of his work. He finds himself slipping into disillusionment and cynicism. His job as a resident has begun to feel meaningless. Participat e in Self-\u00adCare Activities Participate in peer support groups a nd progra ms for personal renewal in order to avoid or heal burnout problems. Attention to your self -\u00adcare is an essential component of competency in professionalism. Sharing the challenges a nd stressors of professional life with collea gues reduces our suffering; \"What is most personal is most universa l.\" Social supports contribute to well-\u00adbeing and buf fer stress. Seek out or create progra ms that promote well-\u00adbeing throughout your professional life, such as the following: Peer support groups Well-\u00adbeing retrea ts Journal clubs on professiona l balance and wellness In January of his second resident year, B ill attended a retreat off ered by his program that focused on finding personal renewal in the work of caring for patients. In discussion, a senior resident shared that she had felt burned out and uncaring by the middle of her second year. Conversa tion led to the vulnerability of residents to burnout, a nd anothe r resident disclosed that he was helped by observing a compa ssiona te and patient faculty member at a dying patient's bedside and then discussing how he remained centered during the encounter. The f aculty member reported that keeping a journal of memorable events from the day gave him an opportunity to reflect on meaningful encounters in a way that the time pressures of work precluded. As the group tal ked, it became clear to Bill tha t he wa s not alone with this erosion of meaning and that there werepersonal and group strategies f or renewing his enthusiasm for medicine. STRATEGIES TO OVERCOME BARRIERS TO WELL-\u00ad BEING Cultivating Emo tional Int elligence restores compassion and enjoyment a nd helps cope with the stress of feeling that our actions may be futile. With practice we can find ways to stea dily renew our energy, at work as well as in other settings. Reflecting on the day's or week's events, perhaps by writing down our thoughts, builds capacity for mindfulness and the ability to be present to the meaning of our work and the gif ts we constantly receive from it. We build additional resilience and further susta in a sense of well-\u00adbeing if we combine strategies. The co ncept of Emo tional Intelligence (E.I. ) The cultivation and expansion of our emotiona l intelligence can help restore our capacity for compassion and enjoyment of work. The feeling o f futilit y derives from t hinking we can co ntrol o utcomes. Loosening the sense of close linkage between our actions and patient outcomes helps inoculate against discoura gement and futility. Sustaining vit ality through steady renewal of energy. Viewing work as a locus of \"energy renewal\" rather than \"energy depletion\" promotes sustainability. Mindfulness brings the st eady renewal concept into practice. Intentional attention to our inner states facilitates renewal at work. Regularly engaging in reflectio n promotes well-\u00adbeing . Brief reflections increase our ca pacity for finding meaning in our lives. Simple strategies such as journa l-\u00adkeeping provide sca ffolding from which we can derive a nd build well-\u00adbeing.

Build resilience by combining well-\u00adbeing strategies, such as journaling, rituals, medita tion, sharing uncomfortable feelings and stressors. The co ncept of Emo tional Int elligence (E.I.) The cultivation and expansion of our emotiona l intelligence can help restore our capacity for compassion and enjoyment of work.(7 ) Emotional intelligence includes the f ollowing components: Developing self-\u00adawareness Acquiring a language for emotions Controlling impulses Delaying gratification Regulating one's moods Recognizing emotions in others Expressing empa thy (Modules 6, 13) Cultivating assertiveness People with high emotional intelligence regard emotions as facts, rather than problems to besolved. They use their emotiona l intelligence to counteract dissocia tion and depersonalization. They discover tha t using components of emotional intelligence helps them develop connections with patients and colleagues. Enhancing emot ional int elligence impro ves relatio nships and teamwo rk Noticing our emotions, naming them, disclosing them to another person, and discussing them develop our capacity for enjoyment and healthy relationships. Among the strategies f or restoring our capacity for compas sion and enjoyment of our work is the cultivation of \"emotional intelligence.\" D eveloping the self-\u00adawareness component of emotiona l intelligence is a challenge f or clinicians who are encouraged to dissociate from their f eelings a s a way of being \"objective\" in their professiona l role. Developing our self -\u00adawareness assists us in maximizing the quality of our relationships, which in turn is a major cont ributor to the therapeutic process as well a s to personal well-\u00adbeing. Emotional intelligence includes acquiring a language f or emotions and enhancing our capacity for self-\u00addisclosure to others. The mirror of these aptitudes is the interest in recognizing emotions in other people, and the capability to do so. We can use our own emotions to develop hypotheses about wha t another person is feeling. We can learn to check out feelings with others, reflect feelings, comment on what we are observing, and receive the emotional disclosure of others without judgment. D evelopment of these capacities seems entirely natural a nd instinctive for some learners, a nd foreign and dif ficult for others, depending on temperament, personality style and past experiences. Assertiveness is central to authenticity in relatio nships Being direct and authentic with others about wha t we think, feel, and want while tolerating their rea ctions and responses requires practice and intention. Valuing and employing this set of skills enables us to ba lance our needs with those of others and to build trusting relationships. Assertiveness is an interpersonal skill-\u00ad the skill of being direct with others about wha t we think, feel, and want in a calibrated way, without whining, shouting, eye-\u00adrolling, hostility or belittling, for example. Problems arise when we deviate f rom being direct, either through habitually devaluing our needs and feelings and subordinating ourselves or through seeking to impose our own will while devaluing others' perspectives and interests. The need to \"fit in\" (above) can lead timid, self-\u00ad effacing or \"sub-\u00adasse rtive\" people to hide their own viewpoints, feelings, and needs from scrutiny. They find it dif ficult to say \"No,\" become overloaded with responsibilities imposed by others and burn out. On the contrary, the continuing need to \"stand out\" or meet extraordinary standards can lea d some people to an overly assertive or aggressive stance. They a re often unaware or intolerant of others' f eelings a nd needs. People who are aggressive in this way can allow their emotions to intrude on others, and can act out and become disruptive. Assertiveness is the path of clarity, respect and the authenticity that is required for meaningful and productive connections with others. Fostering emotional intelligence helps lead to a balancing of our own needs with those of others. We can become more self -\u00adaware, can develop a vocabulary for our emotions, can state our truth while tolerating the emotional responses others may make to that truth, and can set clear limits to the intrusions or transgressions of others. That is, we can more clearly assess our own needs, and calibrate our verbal and non-\u00adverbal expressions. In medical educa tion and clinical practice assertiveness is essential to building trusting relationships, to influencing others with integrity a nd to giving feedback. A resource with excellent suggestions on how to enhance assertiveness is Your Perfect Right. (8) The feeling o f futilit y derives fro m thinking we can control o utcomes Loosening the sense of close linkage between your a ctions a nd patient outcomes helps inoculate against discoura gement and futility. Bill's feeling of futility in caring f or patients who did not get better in spite of his be st efforts emana ted from his own beliefs and expecta tions about control. Gaining clarity about the extent to which control is possible in the events of our lives, and in the prof ession of medicine in particular, is essential to satisfaction with our work. Generally, people tend to be more satisfied when they perceive greater control over outcomes for which they have some responsibility. We indeed can have enormous influence within the array of factors that contribute to illness and health, but must recognize that most patient care outcomes are multi-\u00addetermined and dependent on forces beyond our control, including pa tient choices, genetic and environmenta l variables a nd the work of other team members. A humble, yet realistic wa y of relating to work is to acknowledge that your a ctions are one signifi cant influence among many other signif icant influences on the outcome of a situation. Think in terms of \"inf luence\" rather than \"control\". Releasing the need for treatment outcome to be a marker of competence can provide a helpful cognitive framework for self-\u00adassessment. The Zen philosophy of focusing on \"right action\" in the moment\u2014whether it is the exercise of empathy, conducting a careful physica l exam, engaging in clinica l reasoning, or performing a procedure\u2014is one way to relinquish this intense focus on positive outcomes. Additio nal coping st rategies fo r feelings o f futilit y Other cognitive tools that help inoculate against futility include the following: finding meaning in small victories, such as preventing a hospitalization for a patient with chronic emphysema using a recurrent worsening of a condition, such as a patient repeatedly admitted for diabetic ketoacidosis, as an opportunity to learn more about clinical medicine regarding \"difficult patients\" as visiting professors because of the learning opportunities they provide about how to manage complex interactions focusing on the quality of the rela tionship with the pa tient whose condition is worsening recalling the positive connections with grateful patients when your work is appreciated by others, taking time to reflect on the gifts that you havebrought to the work Sustaining vit ality through steady renewal o f energy Viewing work as a locus of \"energy renewal\" rather tha n \"energy depletion\" promotes sustaina bility.(9 ) An emphasis on the contrast between task accomplishment at work and relaxa tion away from work engenders rituals of doing and thinking that trap us and cause us to experience work as energy depletion. Instead, we can recharge at work if we emphasize the energy exchange that occurs between us and patients or team members during the unique encounters and activities that comprise a workday. This perspective emphasizes that each encounter contains seeds of renewal. Looking at work as a locus of energy depletion is an unsustaina ble situation. D evelop the ability to discover energy renewal in each moment, at work or elsewhere. In f act, competent clinica l work includes a diversity of relationships which can and should bestow on us both inspiration and sustena nce. The notion of work as energy depletion is common to several unhea lthy habits described above (compulsiveness, the psychology of postponement, dissociation from f eelings, and tolera ting conditions of burnout). Many clinicia ns view weekends, va cations, and time with f amily as the opportunity to recharge and recapture a more expansive awareness. Some seek to expand the time available for recharging by working part-\u00adtime. The converse of protected \"personal time\" is the intense compression of \"work time\" a nd the density of tasks to be processed in a given day. An altered state of consciousness may emerge during the surreal pursuit of the processing of tasks in which \"productivity\" is equated with \"being good.\" Clinicia ns enter this trance in the presence of certain ritualistic cues (the door to the office, turning on the computer, checking the schedule, retrieving voice mails), and other eff ects of this state may include running an incessant \"to do\" list, looking for brief tasks to process in an illusory pursuit of \"closure,\" a shortened attention span, irritability in the presence of lengthy or labored conversa tions, a habit of checking a nd rechecking one's work, stewing about difficult interactions in the past, and worrying about future events. Steve McPhee, a professor of medicine at UCSF, contrasts sola r-\u00adpowered and gasoline-\u00adpowered automobiles in thinking about energy in our daily lives.(9 ) The notion of work as a locus of energy depletion (requiring a leaving of work to f ind energy renewal) is simila r to the dependence of industrial societies on non-\u00adrenewable f ossil fuels. When a solar car uses energy, it opens panels that simultaneously dra w energy f rom the sun. The fossil f uel model represents a view of oneself as an individual source of productivity and accomplishment, acting with agency upon the materia l world a nd upon people's lives to achieve outcomes. The solar car model suggests a view of oneself as a medium of energy exchange, a self-\u00adorganizing system much like a candle f lame that gives off light in the process of continuous transformation, a system that is embedded within, and a part of, larger self-\u00adorganizing systems such as a doctor-\u00adpatient relationship, a healthcare system, a society, the earth itself.(10 ) Mindfulness brings the st eady renewal co ncept into practice Intentional attention to our inner states facilitates renewal a t work.Our stream of consciousness typically includes thoughts a bout the past, sometimes accompanied by regret or resentment, a nd thoughts and images of the f uture, sometimes threatening, sometimes esca pist. The \"productivity trance\" (above) drives us to run our \"to-\u00addo\" lists as an incessant background ref rain. What is the psychologica l equivalent of \"opening our solar panels,\" to prepare ourselves for renewal as we move through our days, both at work and at home? One straightforward approach is mind fulness, the discipline of living an intentiona l, conscious life. Mindfulness is a counterweight to enchantment with the \"there a nd then,\" and increases our capacity to be present in the \"here and now.\" Mindfulness involves non-\u00adjudgmental attention to our emotiona l and mental states as they pa ss through awareness. Mindfulness is on the one hand simple, a nd on the other hand requires practice to become proficient, as with a ny skill. (11-\u00ad18 ) Becoming mindful imparts many benefits, and might be considered an important component of professionalism. We can be present to patients without contamina tion from what happens before or after that encounter. (16-\u00ad17 ) We see ourselves as vessels through which the various feelings of joy, sorrow, anger, affection, peace and agitation flow, but these f eelings do not define who we are in any moment of intensity. Mindfulness is then the gateway to accessing opportunities for personal renewal in the midst of work, if we intentionally attend to receiving energy f rom persona l interactions or the satisfaction of work wel l done. (19) Aspects o f mindfulness Mindfulness is a practice and a gateway that opens opportunities f or self -\u00adrenewal as we move through the day.(11-\u00ad18 ) Mindfulness is the practice and habit of being present to where we are and what we're doing. This skill of \"being present\" requires pra ctice to become fully cultiva ted and developed into a habit. The investment in acquiring this skill reaps dividends in enhanced relationships and persona l balance. A group of primary care clinicians who underwent intensive training in mindf ulness showed signif icant improvements in non-\u00adjudgmental attention to the present moment, reduction in burnout and mood disturbance, increased empathy toward patients, and improvement in personality factors of conscientiousness and emotional stability. These cha nges endured severa l months af ter completion of the training.(18) Rituals may be as simple as a conscious pause before entering a patient's room. We can also use recurr ent contextual cues (such as each time we cross a threshold from one room to another) as reminders to pause, attend to our breath, and ref ocus our sensory awareness on the event into which we entering. Mindfulness helps us to attend without judgment, and to not let single encounters, thoughts, or events define who we are. (module 2) \"Being Human is a Guest House\" Attention to the daily surprises a t w ork and in our inner lives can guide us toward well-\u00adbeing. The process of approaching each day with mindfulness and openness to the uncertainty of who will walk in the door next, and non-\u00adjudgmental attention to the \"weather\" of our own emotions and those of others, is ca ptured in this poem by Rumi, the 13th century Sufi mystic whose verses reach across the centuries and cultures to speak to our own experience (20 ): The Guest House This being huma n is a guest house. Every morning a new arrival.A joy, a depression, a meanness, some momenta ry awareness comes as an unexpected visitor. Welcome and entertain them all! Even if they're a crowd of sorrows, who violently sweep your house empty of its f urniture, still, treat each guest honora bly. He may be clearing you out for some new delight. The dark thought, the shame, the malice, meet them at the door laughing, and invite them in. Be grateful for whoever comes, because each has been sent as a guide from beyond. Regularly engaging in reflectio n pro motes well-\u00adbeing Brief reflections increase our ca pacity for finding meaning in our lives. Simple strategies such as journa l-\u00adkeeping provide sca ffolding upon which we can build well-\u00adbeing. If we incorporate a moment of reflection at the end of each day, we gradually become conditioned to perceive the opportunities for personal renewal and meaning contained in various encounters of the day. Using a journal or just pausing to reflect back for five to ten minutes on the events of the day can of fer a transitional time to absorb the gifts tha t came our way, and let go of the day. Angeles Arrien suggests that we ask three simple questions: \"Wha t surprised me today? Wha t moved me today? What inspired me today?\"(21 ) Sometimes we discover importa nt personal meaning in our encounters with the full panoply of human experience, including suff ering.(22 ) Another option would be to keep a \"gratitude journal\" a t the end of each week. Write down a few things for which you are thankful, f rom simple events like wa tching a particularly beautiful sunrise to more profound ones like a satisfying encounter with a patient with whom you had a previous troubling relationship. B uilding in reflective time increases our attentiveness to meaningf ul moments as they occur, and renews vitality. Resilience derives from co mbining well-\u00adbeing strategies Build resilience by combining well-\u00adbeing strategies, such as journa ling, rituals, meditation, sharing uncomfortable feelings and stressors. In the weeks following his retreat, Bill experimented with briefly making daily journa l entries. He began to notice sources of energy boost \u2014a joke shared with nurses, the satisfact ion of being compassiona tely present to a patient's distress, learning a new diagnostic algorithm for certain illnesses, guiding an intern in managing a complex admission, observing a faculty preceptor facilitate a difficult family meeting about end-\u00adof -\u00adlife ca re. Bill started a n introductory book onmindfulness meditation and was sometimes able to take 5 minutes to practice meditation bef ore his day beg an. Some days were incredibly busy, and he was still confronted with uncertain medical dilemmas and dif ficult patients, but he seemed to take it more in stride. He more frequently centered himself before walking into the patient's room by taking a couple of breaths and letting go of what went before, while embracing the unknown of the encounter awaiting him. B ill enjoyed the comradeship of his fellow residents and more often shared stresses and uncertainties. He felt more grounded, less isolated and experienced his work as more meaningful. PROFESSIONAL WORK, INTIMACY AND FRIENDSHIP Demands of professional work conflict with the rest of life, and learning to honor deeply held values by distinguishing between the urgency and importa nce of a dema nd helps to balance your life. Regularly enga ging with f riends and building intimacy through the sharing of dilemmas and conflict builds intimacy. S uccessfully coping with the stresses of long-\u00adterm intimate partnerships, including managing f eelings a bout money, further susta ins well-\u00adbeing. Subordinating relationships to work demands can erode relationships. Professional responsibilities collide with relationship needs and persona l commitments. On any given day it might make sense to let work demands take priority. Cumulatively, however, repeated instances of subordinating personal values leads to erosion of cherished relationships a nd to neglect of vital parts of our lives. Case: Lisa's family co nflict Lisa Loga n tried hard to keep on schedule in order to get to her daughter Mega n's soccer g ame at 5:00, a nd was nearing the end of seeing her own patients and precepting residents. This was 6-\u00ad year-\u00adold Megan's first game of the season, a nd this commitment was of specia l importance to Lisa because last month she was an inpatient attending and had seen very little of her two children. Roger, age 4, complained to Lisa's husband David that he \"hardly saw Mommy any more.\" This was Lisa's fifth year on the residency program f aculty, and she had h oped that by now her routine would be more balanced. Throughout residency David, an attorney whom she married a t the end of medical school, was understanding and tolerant of her late nights and often irregular rotations. Lisa took maternity leave during her second year of residency, but it seemed all too short and she felt she missed many of Megan's developmental milestones. She regretted that David ha d to cancel their last anniversary dinner reservation because she was managing a difficult patient's a dmission. They did have a pleasant evening out the following night, but it was not the same f or her. Earlier today David ca lled to say he might miss Megan' s game, since the case he had hoped to settle was going to trial. S ince Mega n had a ride to the game with her friend' s mother, could Lisa meet her there? Lisa wa s on track when her last patient, who had been trying to get in for two weeks because of intermittent dizziness and headaches, called. Mrs. Albright ha d a flat tire, and would be a half hour late. If Lisa stayed to see Mrs. Albright, who had been waiting two weeks to see her, she would miss most of Mega n's game. For the Go ddess o f Love The \"psychology of postponement\" mentioned above finds poignant expression in this poem by Rabindranath Tagore (23 ): For the Go ddess o f Love There is a ruined temple near here....No one sings now f or the Holy One who was once praised there. The air is motionless and heavy above the altar. The odor of flowers no long pulled f or you f loats in through the door. One of your old worshippers goes out every day into the cities, hoping to receive the good things that he used to ask for from you. And every day at dusk he re turns five thousand miles to his temple, his shoelaces untied, his face tired. How many good days go by! How many nights useful f or worship go by, and not one candle is lit or one poem sung! How many sculptors work the whole day with large shoulders and hair whitened with stone dust making a statue of you, and then as dusk comes carry it to the river and throw it in. She is still in the temple, but no o ne gives Her f ood or takes food from Her, in this ignorance that never ends. Honoring deeply held values: urgency versus impo rtance How we spend time and energy everyday manifests our value hierarchy, and taking a close look at both the urgency and the importance of what we do may reveal that our actions fail to honor what we thought were our deeply held values. Steven Covey, in The Seven Habits of Highly Eff ective People,(24 ) suggests that we compare the urgency of a demand or a potentia l activity with its importance in our va lue hierarchy, before we act. To compare, we can construct a 2 X 2 matrix with four quadrants: IMPORTANT NON IMPORTANT URGENT I III NON URGENT II IV Actions in Quadrant I are bo th impo rtant and urgent, a nd we neglect them at great peril; examples might include a n ICU pa tient who is crashing, a sick family member, a nd completing tax returns on April 14. Quadrant III is the area of deceptio n, where things take on the illusion of importance beca use of the noise of urgency. Failure to discriminate between I and III forces us to overload by responding to emails, voicemails, meetings, and interruptions that can overwhelm our carrying capacity. Most overloa ded people escape into Quadrant IV, t he area o f wast e, where we might mindlessly watch T.V., read cereal boxes, surf the internet, or aimlessly rummage through old files. Quadrant II is where we ho nor our deepest human values, nurture relationships with intimate partners and f amily, mentor others, continue our professional education, engage in strategic planning, attend to our own health needs, do volunteer work for the betterment of our communities, enhance our artistic abilities, and grow spiritually. Because many people view Quadrant II activities a s \"non-\u00adproductive\" and we value their approval, we may move to Quadra nt III, carrying both the illusion of productivity and the appearance of busyness. B ecause of the intensity and even enchantment of the culture's \"productivity trance,\" our challenge is to discern which values belong in Quadrant II and regularly schedule time tohonor them. Sharing yo ur perso nhood by disclo sing dilemmas invites suppo rt Patients and colleagues respond positively and support professiona ls who appropriately show their humanity by sharing their conflicts, dilemma s and values, even indirectly. Megan's soccer game was already on Lisa's schedule, but she now f aced a choice between important values\u2014her patient responsibility a nd her commitment to her daughter. In some cases the burden of choosing can be shared ahead of time with patients, colleagues and f amily. To the extent that we can selectively disclose to patients those a spects of our personal lives tha t we are comfortable sharing\u2014even indirectly by displaying photos of family members, pets or mountains we have climbed\u2014we give ourselves permission to disclose a conflict when it occurs. Likewise we can share with fa mily members the dilemmas that inevitably arise in caring f or sick patients. Sharing with colleagues f requently brings mutual support f or struggles to balance our personal a nd professional lives, a nd we become better a ble to help each other resolve conflicts. Lisa shared her dilemma about Meg an with a colleague, Jim. From previous discussions Lisa knew that J im held similar values about b alancing work and home lif e, and she had covered for Jim during his f ather's illness. She a sked if he could see Mrs. Albright f or her. Jim ag reed, and Lisa asked her nurse to assure Mrs. Albright that she would conf er with Jim and telephone her tomorrow. Lisa f elt confirmed in her decision when she saw Meg an smile and wa ve as her team walked onto the field. Build intimacy with friends, partners and fam ily In relationships outside of medicine we discover our potentia l as persons. The burden of constantly receiving patients' confidences can inhibit our capacity for self-\u00addisclosure and intimacy. In order to deepen f riendships we must f oster this capacity and be intentional a bout seeking time and settings to enrich these relationships. Clinicians expend considerable time with patients and stea dily re ceive their confidences and disclosures, but may have less familiarity with self-\u00addisclosure to friends, or time to engage with them in this intimate way. A fear of intimacy or lack of interest or skill in sharing our inner selves with others sometimes a dds to the challenge of nurturing our relationships that is posed by professional demands. Opportunities for forming friendships abound in the work setting, if we take the initiative to engage with potential f riends. In relationship with others we deepen our identity and discover our potential as persons. Most clinicians develop hobbies and interests outside of medicine in the arts, volunteer work, political action, a faith community, sports, or outdoor activities. However, being with friends without developing our capacity for self-\u00addisclosure is insufficient. Learning to confide in trusted friends is an essential counterbalance to constantly receiving the confidences of patients in our professiona l roles. Long-\u00adterm intimate partnerships Because of the \"psychology of postponement,\" (2) building, sustaining a nd benef iting from anenduring relationship with a n intimate partner requires enhancing our communication skills, learning to tolera te differences, clarifying values, and negotiating issues such a s time, sex, money, and the raising of children. A long-\u00adterm journey with an intimate partner is a cauldron which both tests our identity and expands our capacity to embrace life and endure its stresses a nd challenges. An extended love relationship can be a great spiritual path to our growth and development as persons. In such a relationship we can learn accepta nce of ourselves with all our flaws and virtues, as well a s learn the art of compassion through nurturing our beloved and seeking their well-\u00adbeing. Enhancing our interpersonal communication skills-\u00ad-\u00adespecia lly the art of active listening, disclosure of feelings, and negotiating respectfully when there are differences and conflict-\u00ad-\u00adis central to an enduring relationship. To build and sustain a loving partnership requires scheduled Quadrant II time. Other key ingredients include awareness of our family of origin influences on intimate communication and expectations; learning to tolera te differences in tastes and preferences; clarifying mutual values a s a couple; and negotiating time, sex, money, space, division of labor, and whether and how to raise children. R omance a nd sex occur spontaneously ea rly on, but will later require intentiona l planning to create the time a nd conditions f or this vital component of relationship to ripen into a lasting source of mutual renewal. When intimate relationships stagnate or communication patterns do not feel loving and compassionate, couples counseling can be a valuable resource. Money versus o ther values Clarifying our relationship to money is essential to realizing our life values in a culture that is enchanted with the accumula tion of wealth. Our core philosophy about money, debt and wealth can turn the flow of money through our lives into a burden or a useful tool. Concern about money too often displaces the time required to honor personal values and relationships. Trepidation about paying off educational debts may lead to working longer hours or moonlighting, which diminishes time and energy f or family, f riends, a nd hobbies. Sometimes material aspirations lead us to encumber more debt than necessary and we trade Quadrant II time for money, inevitably a dehumanizing exchange. One clinician couple who realized they were \"sacrificing precious time and earning money to support a lif estyle not worth living\"(28 ) engaged in value clarification and financial assessment that led to downsizing material possessions, eliminating debt, a nd embracing a path of \"voluntary simplicity.\"(29 ) Engaging in clarif ying life values and f inancial goals in consultation with a financial planner or through the self-\u00adhelp literature (25-\u00ad27 ) can provide a framework f or wise decisions a bout money, income and life. Additio nal well-\u00adbeing co mponents Spiritual or religious practice, volunteer service and time in nature a re known to contribute to personal well-\u00adbeing (30), and we describe some a spects of these parameters in this section. Spiritual o r Religio us Pract ice Involvement in a spiritual or religious practice is often a component of human happiness, according to growing evidence. Spiritua lity typically entails a belief system that views oneself as part of a larger whole a nd can involve emotional experiences of awe at the transcendent dimensions of life. This part-\u00adwhole rela tionship gives a sense of narrative meaning to life, in which one's own story is seen as a part of a larger unfolding story. Spiritual experience may or ma y not enta il belief in a divinity or supreme being. The sense of the larger story can provide guidance f or moral decisions. Spirituality is not synonymouswith religion, but may f ind expression through the rituals and community practices of a specif ic religion. If one comes from a particular religious background, it can be helpf ul to understand the influence it played in one's family of origin and one' s own life. Reading widely about the great wisdom traditions and enga ging in dialogue about them ca n deepen understanding of huma nity and inform life choices about spiritua l practice.(31) Volunteer Service Mounting evidence on the health effects of volunteering shows that those who donate time and energy in service to others are healthier, live longer, a nd experience greater well-\u00adbeing than those who do not. One study found that volunteers had higher life satisfaction, a stronger will to live, greater feelings of self-\u00adrespect, and fewer depression and anxiety symptoms than non-\u00advoluntee rs. Volunteering may enha nce mental health f or several reasons. First, it is a form of social participation that buff ers stress and is correlated with mental health. Second, volunteer work is a helping behavior that has intrinsic value and meaning. Third, it gives us a sense that we make a difference, thereby increasing self-\u00ad efficacy. During medical training, discretionary time f or volunteer wor k is limited, but donating even two hours a month in any setting ca n establish a life value that carries over into one's professiona l career. Among abundant opportunities open to clinicians are social service agencies, international relief organizations, environmental protection, and politica l advoca cy.(32) Time in Nat ure Contact with the wildness of nature\u2014whether tending a garden or hiking through the back country\u2014reminds us that we are that part of the earth that has become conscious of itself. Some biologists believe we are wired to respond with inner calmness to the natural world, possibly through activation of the pa rasympathetic nervous system.(34-\u00ad35) Scott Momaday, Pulitzer Prize winning author o f House Made of Dawn, put it this wa y, \"...once in our lives we ought to concentrate our mind upon the remembered earth. We ought to give ourselves up to a particular landsca pe in our experience; to look at it from as many angles as we can, to wonder upon it, to dwell upon it. We ought to imagine that we touch it with our hands at every season and listen to the sounds that are made upon it. We ought to imagine the creatures there and all the f aintest motions of the wind. We ought to recollect the gla re of the moon and the colors of the dawn and dusk.\" (33) We can expand our well-\u00adbeing through periodic excursions into wildness and by carrying memories or photos of these experiences into our daily lives. WORKPLACE HEALTH AND PERSONAL WELL-\u00adBEING Personal commitment is necessary but not sufficient to sustain well-\u00adbeing. Professionals must accept the responsibility of developing model workplaces that support staff well-\u00adbeing. Healthy staff produce better results, such as higher quality, fewer errors and high efficiency, which in turn support the organization. Workplace challenges to Perso nal well-\u00adbeing Toxic workplace structures and demands challenge our personal commitments. Model wo rkplace enviro nment s exist Certain groups have successfully accomplished workplace change. Making institutional change is always a collective enterprise, a nd we will create healthy work environments only to the extent that we collaborate. Healthy wo rkplaces are mo re likely to be sustainable and profitable Organizational health and clinician and worker well-\u00adbeing are mutually reinf orcing.Workplace challenges to perso nal well-\u00adbeing Toxic workplace structures a nd demands challenge our personal commitments. Well-\u00adbeing is not only an individual process, but a politica l process as well. For our own well-\u00adbeing we might accept the challenge of behavior change, and begin, reinvigorate or enlarge activities that we discussed in the preceding sections, such as any of the following: spiritual pra ctice physical activity or an exercise program cultivation of hobbies connecting with nature creative expression in arts or writing volunteer service eating properly and getting adequa te sleep practice of mindfulness or meditation enhancement of our intimate relationships Unfortunately, these well-\u00adintentioned eff orts to balance our lives may evaporate at the next staff meeting, where overwork is reinf orced and rewarded with admiration, the esteem of colleagues and the imperatives of meeting productivity expecta tions. Worka holic collea gues are often rewarded with greater inf luence. B oth in school and at work the \"hidden curricul um\" supports unrealistic ideals of tireless clinicia ns always available to others. For the well-\u00adbeing of health professiona ls to thrive, our workplaces must value the health a nd well-\u00ad being of all their workers. Each of us has a responsibility to enga ge in the difficult work of changing our organizations\u2014medical schools, residencies, health care systems and practice settings\u2014so that they allow time and energy for the persons who comprise the profession to develop and susta in well-\u00adbeing activities and a sense of professionalism. Model wo rkplace enviro nment s exist Certain groups have successfully accomplished workplace change. Making institutional change is always a collective enterprise, a nd we will create healthy work environments only to the extent that we collaborate. Some health care organiza ti ons have developed work environments and policies that honor the values and health of their clinicians. A group of neonatologists in Oregon developed a flexible system that allows each clinicia n to select the amount and distribution and type of work twice a year. They ca n reduce workloa d to pursue non-\u00admedical endeavors, or increase it to meet economic needs. They evolved a consensus building and dia logue process to confront the challenges of promoting balanced lives.(36 ) Indiana University School of Medicine is confronting the \"hidden curriculum\" and f ostering a social environment that consistently embodies a nd reinforces values of personal and professiona l growth, connectedness, passion, and wonder.(37 ) Healthy wo rkplaces are mo re likely t o be sustainable and pro fitable Organizational health and clinician and worker well-\u00adbeing a re mutually reinf orcing. Health care organizations that promote the well-\u00adbeing of their employees and staff discover that satisfiedworkers produce many benefits for the organization. These benef its include, but are not limited to, the following: increased patient satisfaction and lower subscriber turnover better recruitment and retention of clinicians enhanced productivity diminished employee impairment from stress-\u00adrelated f actors improved patient saf ety and reduced errors optimized eff iciency from better communication that diminishes resource utilization (such as tests, referrals) (38, 39 ) The Great Wave o f Kanagawa Katsushika painted chaotic waves, sailors collaborating to keep their boats upright, and Mt. Fuij, fully a nchored to the earth. The painting might be taken to represent certain elements of personal and organizational well-\u00adbeing that were recognized a s important many centuries ago, as they are today. This painting, The Great Wave of Kanagawa , by the artist Hokusai Katsushika, is from a series entitled \"36 Views of Mt. Fuji.\" It captures severa l of the elements of personal and organizational well-\u00adbeing discussed above. The first and most obvious element is the wa ves, which are relentlessly chaotic a nd threaten the balance of the boats. The waves call to mind the ongoing challenges a nd uncertainty o f clinica l practice. The second element are the people in the boats, who require cohesion, teamwork, and ongoing communica tion to keep the boats headed into thewaves and moving successf ully forward on their journey. A healthy organization provides such a disciplined collabora tion for its members, so that no one person bea rs the sole burden of responsibility. The third element is Mt. Fuji, at first indistinguishable from the wa ves, which in its deeply grounded stability provides the still point in the center around which the chaos revolves. Mindfulness and self-\u00adawareness can provide such a stillness within which we can rest at the deepest center of ourselves as we continue to adjust our balance to catch the next wave. PLANETARY SUSTAINABILITY AND PERSONAL SUSTAINABILITY Being mindful of factors that promote environmental and planetary health by increasing carrying capacity or decreasing the loa d from human activity f urnishes us insights into the sustaina bility of our lives and careers. Finally, the health and well-\u00adbeing of our persona l lives a nd of the organizations within which we work is embedded within the health of our planet. Land use planners, when determining where human popula tion growth in a region should be allowed to occur, employ the following equation: C - L = M (Capacity - Loa d = Margin). Here ca pacity refers to the \"carrying capacity\" of the land (available natural resources, transporta tion corridors, and ability to absorb the wastes of human activity.) Load refers to the impact or \"ecological footprint\" of that human a ctivity upon the land. (40) When the carrying capacity of the natural environment is greater than the additional load of human activity, there will be a positive margin a nd popula tion growth is sustainable. Conversely, when load exceeds capacity, there is a nega tive margin a nd growth is unsustainable. On a global scale this same equa tion applies. This same equa tion, C - L = M, might be applied to our own lives and the organiza tions within which we work. When our capacity as persons is chronically overloaded by work, f amily, and other commitments, then we are in a negative margin that is unsusta inable, heading for burnout. It is as if we are drawing down the principal of our resources rather than living off the interest. Conversely, when our capacity routinely exceeds the load we assume, then our lives are susta inable.(41) CONCLUSION Because we are that part of the earth that is conscious of itself, our \"great work\" is to restore the proper relationship of humans with the earth. Our lives of service to patients and colleagues are not sustainable unless we develop attitudes and skills tha t support our well-\u00ad being. B ecause we are health professionals, we should also expand capacity through teamwork and enhancements to the h ealth of our organizations and their workers. Sustaining a life as a professional and as a person in this complex, information-\u00adrich and choice-\u00adrich era necessitates new skills that were not required of previous generations. However, renewing and balancing our lives entails drawing upon the \"practical wisdom\" of previous generations. This practical wisdom, what Aristotle called phronesis, incorpora tes the cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and interpersona l skills to expand our capacity as persons and reduce or eliminate the non-\u00adimportant and unnecessary loads tha t erode our spirits. B ecause we work within healthcare systems, we also are compelled to develop a practical wisdom that promotes workplace sustainability, such as expanding our ca pacity through teamwork, clarifying the organization's values , and establishing structures and processes that enhance the well-\u00adbeing of hea lthcare workers. Finally, we must awaken to the full context of our lives, knowing that we are that part ofthe earth that has become conscious of itself. Restoring the proper relationship of huma ns with the earth in a way that promotes sustaina bility in the whole system is what Thomas B erry has called \"the great work\" of our generation.(42 ) Developing the practica l wisdom to engage in this work in a sustainable way is every clinicia n's personal and collective challenge.

Fortin VI, MD, MPH Questio ns fo r Reflect ion: Many beginning students are so anxious about \"getting the interview right\" tha t they have trouble listening to the patient. Wha t strategies ca n you use to listen attentively? How do you feel a bout asking pa tients about their personal lives a nd emotions? How do you feel a bout becoming a therapeutic agent by the way you interview patients \u2014 how personally involved with patients do you want to be as a clinician? What will you do if a patient cries? Key Principles: Caring for patients means seeking to understand their illness stories in the context of their lives, a nd the interplay of biologica l, psychological, and social f actors that promote illness in individua l patients. This understanding will guide your diagnostic and therapeutic ef forts, and patients will reward your sea rch for understanding with trust and gratitude. Integra ted patient-\u00adcentered and doctor-\u00adcentered interviewing (a process) produces the biopsychosocial data (the content) tha t enables us to ma ke a full diagnosis and ef fectively treat the patient. By learning and practicing basic interviewing skills, you develop f acility at eliciting a complete and accura te medical history. Improving your skills a nd your compassion in an infinite variety of situations is a lifelong process Learning go als: At completion of this module, you will be able to: describe the content, and process of a \"complete\" medical history, describe the difference between the tasks or f unctions of an interview and its structure, describe patient-\u00adcentered and doctor-\u00adcentered interview goa ls and skills, describe the different contributions of patient-\u00adcentered and doctor-\u00adcentered skills to understanding the patient's full (biopsychosocial) history, describe the content and structure the written medical history. FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS AND PRINCIPLES In this module we introduce the medical interview and review important background concepts. We describe the process of obtaining and communicating a complete history through integration of doctor-\u00adcentered and pa tient-\u00adcentered approaches to obtaining information, and then synthesizing the information into a standard \"write-\u00adup\" of the medical history. As you embark on learning and/or improving skills o f interviewing, you will find it helpful to review this list of concepts, each of which is discussed later in the text that f ollows. the biopsycho social mo del the differences between disease and illness the co ncept s of curing and healing the science and art o f medicine the go als o f medical interviewing the tasks, funct ions and skills o f medical interviewing doctor-\u00adcentered and pat ient-\u00adcentered appro aches t o interviewing Biomedical model and biopsycho social mo del With the remarka ble ascendance of biotechnology, the practice of medicine is increasingly biomedically oriented. The \"biomedical model\" assumes that disease is related to pathophysiology and can be understood a nd effectively treated within the realm of biology. George Engel crystallized an alternative way of understanding illness when he articulated the \"bi opsychosocia l model\". (1 ) This model assumes that human health and illness depends not only on fa ctors in the biological sphere, but also derives from f actors in the psychological and socia l spheres of a patient's life. A disturbance in any sphere can affect the illness process. When you understand how these multiple factors interact in patients' illnesses, you can design and recommend more effective therapies. Disease and il lness, curing and healing Disease implies a disruption in normal biologic f unction. D isease is objective: you can see disease processes under a microscope a nd in abnormal laboratory tests. Illness is subjective: people feel a sense of dis-\u00adease; they identify themselves as sick; they beha ve in diff erent ways than when they are healthy; they seek medical care. A patient can have disease without illnes s, as in a breast cancer that hasn't yet been discovered; and illness without disease, a s in hypochondria. Most patients who seek medical care have both disease and illness, in varying degrees. Some stoic patients can have serious disea se but little illness behavior, while other more demonstrative patients may have little biologic disease a nd be incapa citated. These are importa nt distinctions releva nt to daily clinica l work, since patients come to clinicians with their illnesses seeking biologic cure, and clinicians are eager to find and treat the disease. The distinctions of curing and healing now become clearer: we cure diseases withmedications, surgery and biotechnology. We heal illnesses mainly through our words. All clinicians must be able to combine their healing a nd their curing. The science and art of medicine Medicine is a scientif ic discipline, a nd it depends on other scientific disciplines such as anatomy, physiology and pathology, as well as psychology, sociology and other behaviora l sciences. We can understand much of patients' diseases and illnesses through the knowledge a nd skills we have attained in these discip lines. B ut medicine is also an art: health outcomes depend on the unique, intimate relationship between clinicia n and patient. Clinicians use themselves as instruments of diagnosis and therapy. Your unique blend of knowledge, skills, a ttitudes, persona l history, emotions and personality will have an effect in your relationships with patients. Your use of yourself in shaping patient care is what compri ses your unique contribution to the art of medicine. For that reason, you must care f or yourself and seek self-\u00adawareness so that you can use yourself wisely to the benef it of your patients. (modules 3, 4) The go als o f medical interviewing You seek to accomplish severa l goals when you interview a patient. You elicit the information you need to make a diagnosis of a patient's disease. You achieve an und erstanding of the nature of the patient' s illness and how it relates to underlying disease processes. You establish rapport. This rapport engenders trust, which enables patients to reveal critical personal information. A trusting relationship is the f oundation f or effective patient educa tion and counseling. By the end of an interview, you should have a good idea of the differential diagnosis, a sense of why the patient is ill now as opposed to some other time, and of the attitudinal, social and behaviora l factors that contribute to the onset a nd maintenance of illness. The Tasks, Functio ns and Skills of Medical Interviewing Seventy-\u00adf ive to 95 percent of the information needed f or clinicians to make a correct diagnosis comes from the patient-\u00adreported medical history (2 ,3). The quality and quantity of diagnostic information gathered in the medical interview depends on your interviewing skills (4 ,5). Conceptual advances and resea rch findings in recent decades have radically changed our understanding of the medical interview process and the teaching of medical interviewing. A variety of scholars, including contributors to DocCom, have articulated the tasks and f unctions of medical interviewing, and the skills that enable clinicians to a ccomplish these tasks. The major functions and ta sks that mus t be accomplished in a n effective interview include establishing rapport and building trust, eliciting adequate information, understanding patient concerns, and accomplishing patient educa tion and counseling. Medical students and residents who learn core skills have the ability to conduct thorough interviews in a time-\u00adef ficient manner (6). A variety of models have been developed that guide students in learning the skills of medical interviewing (6-\u00ad15 ). Also, clinical reasoning can be taught and integrated into interviewing skills tofacilitate successful history taking (12,16-\u00ad18 ). Caring for the patient by assuring that you carry out all the funct ions of the interview is the f ocus of many modules in Do cCom. In this Module, our emphasis is on the st ructure and co ntent of the information you seek, although we emphasize that how you get the information helps or hinders the building of relationships and prepares the ground for patient educa tion. Experienced clinicians understand th e distinction between the tasks or functions they wish to accomplish during the interview, and the structure of the written history that they will assemble af ter the interview. Learners who master core skills through practice, reflection and feedback are able to use the skills flexibly to a ccomplish the tasks of interviewing. In modules 6 - 12, DocCom authors present and elaborate the tasks and skills agreed on by the Kalamazoo Consensus panel. This group of schola rs, including advocates a nd designers of the various models of interviewing, was able to agree on names and descriptions for 7 essential skills, tasks and functions of medical interviewing; namely, building a relationship with patients, opening the discussion, gathering information, understanding the patient's perspective, sha ring information, reaching agreement, and closing the interview.

Click on the picture-\u00adbutton above to see Movie ONEClick on the picture-\u00adbutton above to see Movie TWO What are t he compo nents of each approach that were effective and ineffect ive in eliciting the patient 's story? Doctor-\u00adCentered and Patient-\u00adCent ered Appro aches t o Interviewing Historically, most clinicians conducted \"doctor-\u00adcentered\" interviews. That is, they took charge of the interaction to acquire speci fic details of the patient's story, in order to diagnose a disease. Most of the questions were guided by the doctors' clinical reasoning, and their need to elicit certain information to choose among various hypotheses a bout disease states. However, doctor-\u00adcentered interviewing often ignored importa nt personal da ta and lacked the personal and affective content necessary to establish a trusting relation ship and understand the patient's illness experience.Relationship has always been paramount, but establishing trust became increasingly difficult as biotechnical aspects of disease increased, diagnostic tests became more complex and invasive, specia lists emerged, and clinician-\u00adpatient encounters were more often between complete strangers. Engel a nd others started teaching another style of interviewing: the \"patient-\u00adcentered\" interview. In this style, the focus is primarily on understanding the patient's story, allowing the patient to do most of the work, with the clinician being guided by what patients were trying to reveal about the nature of their illness and life. Evidence supports the contention that you will obtain the most accura te and complete biopsychosocial story by integrating patient-\u00adcentered interviewing with doctor-\u00adcentered interviewing. However, whether you are using doctor-\u00adcentered or patient-\u00adcentered techniques, your dialog is persistently focused on understanding the patient's story so that you achieve a full understanding of the patient's illness. The skills and techniques of \"patient-\u00adcentered\" and \"doctor-\u00adcentered\" interviewing overla p and are not entirely unique to one style or the other. We present them sequentially below for clarity, but experienced clinicians move back and forth quite flexibly, as called for by the details of a particular encounter with a particular person with particula r problems. For example, different skills may be required when encountering patients who tell complete stories in linear sequence, situations that are very urgent, or diseases and illnesses which differ greatly in complexity a nd severity. Because the medical interview is one of our most complex, intensely personal and potentially i nvasive procedures, it requires sensitivity, delicacy and a full understanding of skills and strategies, like coronary artery bypass surgery and other procedures we perform. The learning process is complica ted, dependent on your personality, attitudes and unique gifts, and the learning continues throughout your professiona l career, as your experience with disease, illness and patients' lives expands and broadens. In this module we present ideas about sequencing, timing and chronology that clinica lly inexperienced learners will find useful f or getting started, and more experienced learners will identify new aspects for more intensive study. We could say tha t you are learning the notes a nd chords and rhythms of music, so that you can actually make music sooner rather than later. The \"old way,\" to par aphrase Engel, was to \"send students off with a piano for a time and tell them to come back a nd say what they had discovered about music.\" We can do better, thanks to the work of scholars who have studied the interview and the learning process. This module is a n overview, and the specific skills involved in performing an interview a re discussed in more detail in subsequent modules. We expect your stud y and/or review of the concepts in this module will prepa re you well f or the complexities and uncertainties you will encounter as your ca reer in medicine develops. PATIENT-\u00adCENTERED INTERVIEWING SKILLS We divide the process of patient-\u00adcentered interviewing into 5 steps and 21 sub-\u00adsteps to enhance learning.(19 ) Always integrated with doctor-\u00adcentered interviewing (steps 6-\u00ad10), the 5 patient-\u00adcentered steps focus on the patient: his or her interests, concerns, and questions as well a s physical symptoms. The doctor-\u00adcentered portion occurs next and pins down biopsychosocial details that do not arise during patient-\u00adcentered interviewing, especia lly the details needed to dia gnose and treat disease. As patients tell their stories during this initial patient-\u00adcentered phase, hold your own questions about possible disea se diagnoses until the doctor-\u00adcentered phase, which usually will be no more than a few minutes later. Many terms in the Steps below require further explanation, which you will f ind in subsequent text or other DocCo m modules. It is normal to be a bit overwhelmed a s you initially encounter the complexi ty of patient-\u00adcentered interviewing. We identify a nd describe 21 discrete skills, which are easily learned in 2-\u00ad3 teaching sessions. Clinicians use these skills hundreds of times a day, a nd the skills will soon become ref lexive f or you a s well. While f ull mastery of patient-\u00adcenteredinterviewing usually requires more learning time than the more \"rote\" doctor-\u00adcentered list of questions, good pa tient-\u00adcentered interviewing saves time and produces a more robust picture of the problems at hand. In this section you'll f ind in-\u00addepth information about: Step 1 Set the stage for the interview. Step 2 Obtain the patient's a genda. Step 3 Open the History of Present Illness (HPI). Step 4 Obtain more details a bout the HPI. Step 5 Transition to the Doctor-\u00adCentered portion of the interview. Step 1: Set the st age fo r the int erview (30 to 60 seco nds) Bolded statements a re the specif ic sub-\u00adsteps. 1. Use a simple statement and a handshake to welcome the patient . This makes him or her feel valued and sets the proper tone f or the interview. 2. Use the patient's name. It is best to use last name until the patient asks you to do otherwise. 3. Introduce yo urself and identify yo ur specific ro le. If you are a student, say so and indicate that you are part of the healthcare team. An example of a statement that includes sub-\u00adsteps 1, 2, a nd 3 is \"Welcome, Mr. Smith. My name is Ma ry Jones and I a m the medical student with D r. Green. I a m here to listen to your story and will be part of your care team.\" 4. Ensure the patient's readiness and privacy. Address any physical or emotional conditions that ma y preclude an ef fective interaction with the patient e.g., \"You look upset. Is everything a ll right?\" 5. Remo ve any barriers to communicat ion. For example you ma y need to turn off a noisy television or make sure that you have a n interpreter for a patient that does not understand English well. 6. Make any necessary physica l adjustments in the room and conduct light conversation to ensure t he patient 's comfort and put him o r her at ease with brief light talk e.g., about the weather or the hospital f ood. Step 2: Obt ain the patient 's agenda; including t he chief co ncern (30 to 60 seco nds, see Do cCom mo dule 7) 1. Indicat e time available to orient the patient to the expected duration of the visit. \"We have about 30 minutes today...\" 2. Indicat e your needs. For example you can say, \"I have a list of questions and we will need to do a physical exam...\" to indicate your need for sufficient time to obtain the database of a new patient. 3. Obtain a list of all the issues the patient want s to address. Hospitalized patients usually present with a clear set of symptoms, identified as the chief compla int. (e.g., \"I' ve been having chest pain,\" \"I' ve had a fever and bad cough f or 3 days.\") Outpatients usually come to their doctor with multiple concerns. You will of ten need to ask prompting questions like \"anything else?\" or \"do you need any prescriptions or forms filled?' because you would like to avoid having important issues arise at the end of the allotted time. You may need to respectfully deter the patient from offering too many details a bout agenda items at this point with a statement like \"That sounds important and we will get to the neck pain in a minute, but I need to know whether there are other things you would like us to accomplish today.\" 4. Summarize and finalize t he agenda to clarif y the chief concern, prioritize the list a nd negotiate with the patient to decide wha t will be addressed today a nd what will be deferred to the next visit. Step 3: Open the Histo ry of Present Illness (HPI) (30 - 60 seconds, see Do cCom mo dule 8) 1. Use an o pen-\u00adended beginning questio n or stat ement to begin the HPI. It focuses on the chief complaint, the primary problem you identified in Step 2. Because many diseases unfold in characteristic ways, it is always helpful to ask patients to start their stories at the beginning: \"You told me you've been having chest pain. Could you tell me all about it, f rom when it f irst began until you decided to come into the ER last night.\" 2. Use no n-\u00adfocusing open-\u00adended skills like silence, neutra l utterances (e.g. \"uh-\u00adhuh\") and nonverbal encouragement (nodding, leaning forward) to encourage patients to talk. If they do not talk freely, use open-\u00adended focusing skills (echoing, direct requests -\u00ad \"can you tell me more?\" -\u00ad and summarization) to encourage patients to tell their stories. 3. Obtain addit ional dat a fro m no n-\u00adverbal so urces by mentally noting the patient's physical chara cteristics, appearance and environment. For example, a framed picture of a young military officer could be a key to eliciting a patient's anxiety about his son a t war. Step 4: Co ntinue to obtain t he HPI (5 - 10 minutes) 1. (1 minute) We usua lly start with f ocusing, open-\u00adended skills (echoing, direct requests and brief summaries) to obtain a good overview of the patient's physical sympto ms; e.g., \"...so the chest pain began at work with a lot of stress yesterday; say more about the pain.\" Avoidasking specif ic questions about the details of onset, duration, and radiation of pain at this point and encourage the patient to lead the interaction; that is, don't ask about where the pain radiates or if the patient was short of breath if they haven' t mentioned it. 2. (3-\u00ad5 minutes) Next, use focusing open-\u00adended skills to develop the perso nal o r psychosocial co ntext of the patient's story by shif ting your focus to this material. We direct the patient to immediate or previous statements that ref er to the patient's psychosocial circumstances; e.g. \"Now tell me about the stress you mentioned.\" It is important here to repeatedly apply open-\u00adended skills to what a ppear to you to be the most important things the patient is saying. This will produce a brief narrative, the pa tient's story; e.g., chest pain began during a stressf ul work situation...pa tient has been out of work...started this new job one week ago. 3. (30-\u00ad60 seconds) Use emotion-\u00adseeking skills to develop an emot ional cont ext. The best way to develop an emotiona l context is to ask the patient how he or she feels about a personal situation (direct inquiry); e.g., \"Missing work right now, how does that make you feel?\". If the patient responds with a thought or ignores the inquiry about emotion you can use indirect inquiry to \"prime the pump.\" You c an relate your previous experiences if appropriate and accura te (self-\u00addisclosure), or you can a sk about the impact of the condition on the patient or their f amily or about the patient's explanatory model to generate emotions in him or her when direct inquiry is not effective. When the patient of fers an emotion, ask questions to expand your understanding, e.g. \"Why does that bother you so much?\" \"Tell me more about being sa d.\" 4. (30-\u00ad60 seconds) Use emotion-\u00adresponse skills to address emot ions. Emotion-\u00adresponse skills allow you to express empathy and help patients' express their emotions fully and without embarrassment; e.g., \"...scared about losing your job, I understand; it's been a hard time f or you these last 4 months. Let' s you and I work on this together.\" We use the mnemonic NURS to remind us to name the patient's expr essed emotions, make an understanding statement, respect the patient by praising them or acknowledging their plight and to offer our support. Other memory a ids that remind us of helpful responses to patients' expression of feelings include PEARLS, which reminds us that statements of partnership, empathy, appreciation (and apology, when appropriate), respect, legitima tion a nd support a re effective; or SLRRP, which stands for support, legitimation, ref lection, respect, and partnership (module 6 has more deta il about the importance of these skills). 5. (remainder of time available) Sub-\u00adsteps 15-\u00ad17 generate much new information. Now use repeated cycles of focusing open-\u00adended skills, emotion-\u00adseeking skills and emotion-\u00ad responding skills to further deepen the pat ient's sto ry and test hypotheses a bout their psychosocial situa tion; concentrate on the personal story as much as possible at this stage. Each cycle a mounts to a new chapter of the patient's story. Step 5: Transitio n to the Do ctor-\u00adCentered po rtion of the interview 1. Use 2 or 3 sentences to briefly summarize the patient's story 2. Check t he accuracy of your summary 3. Indicat e that the co ntent and style of quest ioning are abo ut to change (e.g., \"Now I'm going to ask you several questions to better understand why you are having a headache, and questions I ask of all my new patients.\") Patient-\u00adcentered interviewing is used in virtually all situations, from the new patient to the returnvisit, from the emergency room to the consultation, and from surgery to obstetrics. Rarely, however, one does not employ patient-\u00adcentered inquiry: 1) if the patient's condition is so critical and urgent that spending a couple minutes this way would be dangerous; 2) if it makes the pa tient uncomfortable, especially in adolescents and children; 3) if the patient is not mentally competent. Therefore, we can expect to employ patient-\u00adcentered interviewing in nearly all situations. We now describe the doctor-\u00adcentered interviewing process tha t follows. DOCTOR-\u00adCENTERED INTERVIEWING SKILLS The doctor-\u00adcentered portion of the interview focuses on testing clinical hypotheses and expands the data base of patient information. What you have obtained through patient-\u00adcentered interviewing constitutes the initial part of the patient's story, and comprises most of the \"history of present illness\" (HPI). P atient-\u00adcentered data, however, ra rely complete the story. You need more details to make diagnoses of disease a nd fill in the database; e.g., the family history and socia l history. The doctor-\u00adcentered part of the interview diff ers from the patient-\u00adcentered part because in it you ask about symptom information not yet mentioned by the patient (details of symptoms already mentioned and new symptoms not yet mentioned) in order to complete the HPI. You also explore other aspects of the patient's life and history to discover other diseases outside the HPI, assess f or disease risk, a nd come to know the patient better on a personal level. One way to conceptualize this process is to understand that in patient-\u00adcentered segments of interviews, clinicia ns provide patients with pro mpts, and then listen intently to whatever the patient offers about symptoms, timing and other details, feelings, connections, background and so on. In doctor-\u00adcentered segments, clinicia ns seek answers to specif ic questio ns they have, based both on hypo theses they generate from listening carefully to patients' stories, and on the need for \"routine\" background information that experience has shown may provide additional clues (\"with whom do you live; do you drink alcohol, are you having sex,\" and so on.) (19 ) In this section you'll f ind in-\u00addepth information about: Step 6 Obtaining more deta ils about the HPI Step 7 Past Medical History Step 8 Family History Step 9 Psychosocial History Step 10 Review of Systems Physical Examination Step 6: Co mpletion o f the HPI The first task of the doctor-\u00adcentered component of the HPI is to expand the description of symptoms and obtain details not yet introduced by the patient (e.g., medications, hospitals,doctors) (19 ). Table 1: Filling in the history of present illness 1. Define the cardinal f eatures of the patient' s chief concern 2. Define the cardinal f eatures of other symptoms (those already mentioned by the patient and those not yet introduced) in the organ system of the patient's chief concern 3. Inquire about relevant symptoms outside the involved system 4. Inquire about relevant nonsymptom (secondary) data The fo llowing to pics are covered further in this sub-\u00adsectio n: Expand descriptions of symptom(s) already mentioned by the patient. Inquire about symptoms not yet introduced that occur in the same body system. Ask about releva nt symptoms outside the body system involved in the HPI. Elicit the presence or absence of relevant non-\u00adsymptom data (secondary data) not yet introduced by the patient . Scanning Without Interpretation Versus Hypothesis-\u00adTesting. Becoming patient-\u00adcentered when appropriate. Expand descript ions of sympto m(s) already ment ioned by t he patient To fully understand a symptom, you need to know its seven \"cardina l features\". (19,20 ) (Table 2) In the patient-\u00adcentered interview, pa tients tell you many of a symptom' s features, but even the most articulate pa tients are unlikely to mention all possible f eatures when telling their story. Therefore, in the doctor-\u00adcentered portion of the interview, seek a dditional details. Start with an open-\u00adended request (\"Tell me more about wha t your chest pain is like\"), and then ask more specif ic closed-\u00adended questions to elicit a ll the cardinal fea tures (\"You pointed to the left side of your chest; does the pain travel a nywhere?\"). For non-\u00adpain symptoms such as weakness or dizziness, not a ll cardinal f eatures apply (e.g., location, radiation). (module 8) The precise locatio n of a sympto m and whether it radiates are diagnostically important (e.g., substernal chest pain radiating down the left arm suggests angina pectoris or myocardial infarction). The qualit y of a sympto m is telling. For example, substernal chest pain that is burning is more likely to be due to esophageal ref lux, while squeezing or crushing chest pain is more likely to be cardiac. Patients sometimes describe their symptoms in odd wa ys, e.g., \"It feels like someone is reaching inside me and tearing me apart.\" S uch langua ge ma y hint at psy chologica l problems, although itmay simply emanate from someone who likes colorful langua ge or metaphor. Use a numeric rating scale to quantify pain, \"On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being no pain and 10 being the worst you ca n imagine, what number would you give this pain you're describing?\" Chro nology provides importa nt clues to the nature of disease and illness, and coherence to patients' stories: the primary problem, when it began, its course to the present, and its previous treatment. Fill in all rele vant data to understand the big picture -\u00ad-\u00ad the patient's interacting biologic, psychological (personal, emotional), and social dimensions. Organize all f eatures to fit within the chronology. Table 2. The 7 cardinal f eatures of symptoms 1. Location and radiatio n Precise location Deep or superf icial Localized or diffuse 2.

Modifying facto rs Precipitating and aggravating f actors Palliating fa ctors 7. Asso ciated sympt oms (Modif ied Patient interviewing . 2nd ed. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; 2002.) Inquire about sympt oms no t yet int roduced that o ccur in the same body syst em After eliciting a complete picture of the patient's symptom story, ask about other symptoms in the same body system as the one described in the HPI. In essence, do a focused \"review of systems\" (ROS) of that one body system. D etermine not only which other symptoms a re present but also which ones are absent; for example, the absence of dyspnea (shortness of breath on exertion) in a patient with chest pain weighs against a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Ask abo ut relevant sympt oms o utside the body system invo lved in the HPI Next, ask about symptoms outside the involved body system if they are pertinent to a diagnosis you are considering. For example, in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis who is feeling fatigued, asking about gastrointestinal bleeding symptoms (\"any black stools?\"). Bleeding is not a joint or musculoskeletal symptom, but is relevant if you suspect gastrointestinal bleeding caus ed by drug therapy that irritates the stomach. In patients with more than one problem, you will need to inquire about multiple systems in the HPI. Elicit the presence or absence o f relevant no n-\u00ad sympt om dat a (secondary dat a) not yet introduced by the patient Elicit any information concerning medications taken, treatments received, doctor visits and hospitaliza tions, and dia gnoses given. Also, asking questions a bout possible causes f or the diagnoses being enterta ined may help narrow the differential diagnosis. For example, if pulmonary embolism is a concern, ask about recent long car rides or air travel. Scanning witho ut int erpretatio n versus hypo thesis-\u00ad testing When you f irst learn medical interviewing you will seldom know what diseases might be causing a patient's symptoms. By using the patient-\u00adcent ered and doctor-\u00adcentered approach, you will gather sufficient data to guide your search of texts and other resources to discover likely diagnoses. Early on you must be exhaustive in your interviewing because you are not generating diagnostic hypotheses or interpreting the patient's responses in rea l-\u00adtime to guide your f urther questioning. (2,5) You may need to return to the patient with additional questions after reading about the problem and developing new hypotheses about wha t is causing the symptoms. As your medical knowledge and interviewing experience increase, however, you will begin to have ideas or \"hunches\" about wha t might be causing a patient's symptoms. You can then ask specif ic questions to test these hypotheses.(19 ,21) For example, a patient with sudden shortness of breath and chest pain following a long car ride might prompt consideration of pulmonary embolism. To test this hypothesis, ask about hemoptysis (coughing up blood), leg pain, whether the chest pain is worse when taking a deep breath (pleuritic in qua lity), and if there is a prior history of deep venous thrombosis. With time and practice, knowledge and skills develop suff iciently to allow reliance upon the hypothesis-\u00addriven approach, although never completely abandoning the scanning approach.Beco ming patient-\u00adcentered when appropriate To provide the most compassionate, eff ective and eff icient service for your patients, you will utilize your patient-\u00adcentered emotion response skills to express ca ring and empathy whenever the patient expresses emotion. When patients express emotion, your relationship with them will improve if you respond in real time. You lose trust and erode confidence if you do not respond. When ill, we are all especially vulnerable, and need our care-\u00adgivers to show us that they are aware of our plight, and especially of our humanness. If our expression of emotion is not acknowledged, it seems as though it fell on deaf ears, and that the listener cares more about something else (the symptom, the lab test, our allergies, or our stomach) tha n about the vulnerable hum an being in front of them. Further, when patients experience more trust and hear your a cknowledgement of their feelings, they tend to expand what they have been saying, to trust you with secrets that may be very important clues to both dia gnosis and treatment, and to help you as much as they can. Although you ma y be the best cardiologist in your area, if the patient is not experiencing increa sing confidence that you care about him or her as much a s you ca re about the heart, they will \"shut down\" and cooperate less willingly and fully. Some will even \"punish you\" (usually unconsciously), withhold information and ma ke your job much harder than it needs to be. For example, if during the Family History the patient becomes tearf ul and indicates sadness a bout her father' s death (whether it happened las t week or 10 years ago), a compassionate response from you, such a s \"I see that thinking about your father makes you very sad\" will be helpful. You will likely learn more about this event and its potential contribution to the present problems, and also f irm up your relationship with the pa tient through your communication of your attempt to better understand her situation. Step 7: Past Medical Histo ry Although you ma y have a reasonable picture now that you have obtained relevant details of the HPI, you still need ancillary data to complete the picture. Some data will be rela ted directly to the HPI (e.g., a recent myocardial infarction will be germane in a patient with bloody stools if he requires major surgery). Other \"routine\" or ancillary data will not immediately relate to the HPI but is still important (e.g., exercise habits, education, intimate partners, and family history of tuberculosis). The approach to the remainder of the history is similar to the doctor-\u00adcentered part of the HPI. Questioning should usually begin in an open-\u00adended f ashion in each major area and then be followed by closed-\u00adended questions to obtain details, always remembering to return to the patient-\u00ad centered skills, a nd to be aware of the patient's emotions as you go along. You will obtain specif ic ancillary data in the Past Medical History (Table 3). Start with open-\u00adended questions (e.g., \"Can you tell me about your other medical problems?\") and then focus a s needed with closed-\u00adended questions to establish details (e.g., \"How long have you had high blood pressure?\" \"What medicines a re you taking f or it?\"). For chronic illnesses, include the duration of illness or diagnosis date along with current management a nd level of symptom control, related complica tions a nd any recent objective measures of disease activity (eg D iabetes Mellitus Type 2, diagnosed 12 yrs ago, controlled with daily oral medications, only known complication is mild renal insufficiency, hemoglobin A1C one month ago 7.2) Table 3 shows a list of all past history components. Medicat ionsDetermine the medications the patient takes, including both dosa ge and administration (by mouth, vagina lly, topical, etc). Ask about over-\u00adthe-\u00adcounter medications and herbal, complementary or alternative remedies. Ask specifically a bout birth control pills, hormones, laxatives, and vitamins, as some patients do not consider these to be medications. Allergies Ask about environmental, f ood, and medication allergies. Determine exa ctly what reaction the patient had to a medication, since many medicatio n \"allergies\" reported by patients are actually expected side effects (e.g., itching with morphine) or non-\u00ada llergic adverse reactions (e.g., gastric bleeding f rom aspirin). Table 3: Past medical history 1. Inquire abo ut general state o f health and past illnesses Childhood: measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, sca rlet fever, and rheumatic fever Adult: hypertension, cerebrovascular accident, diabetes, heart disease, tuberculosis, venereal disea se, cancer Chronic illnesses: include duration of illness or diagnosis date a long with current management and level of symptom control, rela ted complications and recent objective measures of disease activity 2. Inquire abo ut past injuries, accidents, psychot herapy, unexplained pro blems 3. Elicit past ho spitalizatio ns (medical, surgical, obstetric, and psychiatric) including dates 4. Review the patient 's immunizat ion hist ory boosters, hepatitis B , hepatitis A, influenza, pneumococcal pneumonia 5. Obtain t he patient 's obstetric hist ory and menst rual histo ry Age of cycle length, length of menstrual flow, number of tampons/pads used per day Number of pregnancies, complica live births, spontaneous vagina l deliveries/cesarean section; number of spontaneous and therapeutic abortions Age of menopause 6. List current medications, including do se and ro ute Ask specif ically about over-\u00adthe-\u00adcounter medicines, alternative remedies, contraceptives, vitamins, laxatives 7. Review allergies Environmenta l, medica tions, foods Ensure that medication \"allergies\" are not actually expected side effects or nonallergic adverse reactions 8. Health pro motion Safety Seatbelt use Safety helmet use Smoke detectors in home Safe gun storage Screening Cervical cancer Breast cancerProsta te cancer Colon cancer Lipids Hypertension Diabetes HIV Syphilis Tuberculosis Glaucoma Step 8: Family Hist ory (FH) Ask about the age and health of the patient's immediate fa mily as well a s the causes of death, when they died, and ages of f irst-\u00addegree relatives. Information f rom the FH frequently gives you clues about the patient's concerns. For example, a patient presents with chest pa in, and you learn that his brother died a year earlier from a heart attack. Or the patient is 50 years old a nd you learn that her mother died at age 51 from breast cancer. Screen for genetic and environmental illnesses by inquiring about a family history of diseases such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, tuberculosis, a lcoholism, and asthma. Table 4: Family history 1. Inquire about age and health (or cause of death) of grandparents, parents, siblings, and children 2. For patients who do not readily volunteer information, depending on your thinking about the likely causes of the patient's symptoms, you ma y need to ask specif ically about a family history of: Diabetes Tuberculosis Cancer Hypertension Stroke Heart disease Hyperlipidemia Bleeding problems Anemias Kidney disease Asthma Tobacco use Alcoholism Weight problems Symptoms similar to those the patient is experiencing Mental illness depression suicide schizophrenia multiple somatic concernsStep 9: Psycho social Histo ry The psychosocial history describes behaviors and other personal factors that may impact disease and illness risk, severity and outcome; it also helps you to get to know the patient. The psychosocial history complements the personal and emotional information obtained in the patient-\u00adcentered portion of the interview. As you ga in experience, you learn which questions are most important to ask for a particular patient encounter. Some highlighted items in Table 5 will identify targets for risk factor modif ication, and are infrequently spontaneously brought up by patients. They need open and non-\u00ad judgmenta l discussion, which builds trust and relationship, and assures the most accurate information. You ma y need to obtain this type of information over multiple patient encounters. Some of the most important areas of the Psychosocial History are detailed below in this section: Habit s Perso nal Issues Domestic Partner Vio lence Spiritualit y and Religio us Beliefs Table listing all psycho social histo ry compo nents Habits Ask about tobacco use, including forms of tobacco (e.g., pipe, snuff, chewing tobacco) and number of pack-\u00adyears for ciga rette use. (A pack-\u00adyear is one pack of cigarettes per da y for a year. If a patient smoked 2 pa cks of cigarettes per day f or 10 years, you would say the patient was a 20 pack-\u00adyear smoker.) Determine whether the patient consumes a lcohol and whether it may be a health problem. A sk \"Do you drink alcohol\", and follow up a \"yes\" answer with the \"CAGE\" questions: \"Have you ever felt you should cut do wn on your drinking?\" \"Have people annoyed you by criticizing your drinking?\" \"Have you ever feld bad or guilt y about your drinking?\" \"Have you ever had a drink f irst thing in the morning to steady your nerves or get rid of a hangover?\" (eye-\u00ado pener) (For a full discussion of screening for alcoholism, see module 29.) Ask about the pa tient's use of drugs: \"Have you used marijauna , street drugs, or prescription drugs to have fun or get high in the last year?\" If yes, then ask, \"have you f elt you wanted or needed to cut down on your use of this/ those drugs in the last year?\" Perso nal issues Occupatio n A patient's occupation can a ffect health.(22 ) Ask, \"What kind of work do you do? What other jobshave you had? Have you ever been exposed to fumes, dust, ra diation, or loud noise at work? D o you think your work is af fecting your symptoms now?\" If the patient does not work outside the home, ask what a typica l day is like. Stress Most pa tients have stress in their lives, which may contribute substantially to the onset and maintenance of their symptoms. A simple question often elicits an important story: \"Tell me about the stress in your life\" \"Is life stressful these days?\" Mood Depressive a nd anxiety disorders each occur in 11-\u00ad12 % of people, and up to 50% of depressive disorders are missed in primary care. Simple questions will guide you in whether to seek f urther details to establish the presence of an important disorder. \"So-\u00ad how are your spirits these days?\" \"Are you getting any pleasure in life?\" \"How is your sleep?\" Home Life A good way to inquire about home life is to ask, \"Does anyone else live at home with you? Tell me about him or her.\" \"How do you get along?\" Sexuality Asking about a patient's spouse or significa nt other should provide a comfortable segue into asking about sexuality.(23 ) Do not assume a patient's sexual orientation or sexua lity. Gender-\u00adneutral language to gay, lesbian, bisexual, a nd transgender patients tha t it is safe for them to be honest and open with you. You can elicit basic importa nt information with the questions shown below. \"Is there someone special in your life? Are you and this person having sex?\" \"Has your illness affected your sexual f unctioning?\" \"Do you have sex with men, women, or both?\" Many situations will require that you ask more details, such as the questions below: \"Do you have sex with anyone who might be at risk for having sexually transmitted diseases or HIV (injection drug users, cocaine users, prostitutes, unknown partners, gay or bisexual men)?\" \"Are you using condoms to prevent disease? What percent of the time? \"Do you have a ny other sexual relationships tha t I should know about?\" Some patients and some clinicians are bothered by these questions, and we explore the issues in more detail in module 18. Domestic Partner Vio lence Domestic violence occurs in as many as 1 of every 4 US f amilies. Both because this is so f requent, and beca use patients are unlikely to broach this issue themselves, clinicians must sen sitively inquire about domestic partner violence. One suggested approach (24) is \"Have you ever been hit, slapped, kicked, or otherwise physically hurt by someone? Ha s anyone ever forced you to have sexual activities?\" (We will explore more about this in module 28) Spiritualit y and Religio us Beliefs Spirituality and religious beliefs are important to many patients, especia lly in times of illness. The following questions will get you started (25 ):\"Do you consider yourself to be a spiritual or religious person?\" \"What importance does faith have in your life?\" \"Are you a part of a spiritual or religious community?\" (We explore this issue in more detail in Module 19.) Psychoso cial histo ry Table 5: Psycho social histo ry Living arrangement (with who m, how are t hings at home? Work/daily activities (sat isfact ion, expo sures) Physical to nal relat ionships and support syst ems (Who do you count o n? Ho w have people respo nded to your illness?) Sexuality (o rientat ion, risk assessment, pro blems or co ncerns) Domestic vio lence/abuse Stress Mood Health beliefs Spiritualit y/religio n Important life experiences Upbringing and family relationships Schooling Milita ry service Financial situation Aging Retirement Life satisfaction Cultural/ethnic background Functional status (taking care of self -\u00ad toileting, bathing, dressing; ma naging daily activities -\u00ad working, shopping, cooking, house cleaning) Items in bold should be asked about in most new patient encounters: they have high yield for risk factor modification, assist in building the doctor-\u00adpa tient relationship, and/or are important to patients but rarely brought up by them Step 10: Review of Systems The review of systems (ROS) is a head-\u00adto-\u00adtoe survey to uncover symptoms not elicited earlier in the interview. You alrea dy performed part of the ROS while f illing in the HPI. Now, survey the remaining body systems to ensure that the database is complete (Table 6). From data ga thered in the HPI and past medical history you will a lready have a reasonable idea a bout the major diagnostic possibilities. The ROS is not used to elucidate key features of the present illness.(19 ) Rather, it is used to screen for any a dditional symptoms unrelated to the HPI (e.g., abnormal rectal bleeding in a patient with suspected pneumonia). As you gain experience, you will settle ona few questions from each system which you routinely use, and you will become proficient and efficient at asking them. You cannot ask a bout every possible symptom, so you will select some that help you cover important bases. Most importa ntly the direct and attentive way that you ask these \"routine\" questions signals to patients both your biomedical competence, and your invita tion to listen a bout any symptom, illness or issue that might be relevant. The ROS completes your interview. After completing the interview you will usually begin examining the pa tient. Some clinicians, in the interest of saving time, will ask ROS questions as they are going through relevant segments of the physical exam. Table 6 below lists all review of systems components: Table 6: Review of systems. (medical terms [used in oral a nd written presentations] are in parentheses) 1.

Musculo skeletal Weakness Muscle pain Stiffness Arthritis GoutRECORDING THE PATIENT'S HISTORY: THE MEDICAL HISTORY WRITE-\u00adUP The written description of patient information in the medical record is called the medical 'write-\u00ad up.' It usually contains the patient's history, physical examination, initial diagnostic tests, problem list, assessment, and pla ns for further investigations and treatment. We will f ocus here only on the write-\u00adup of the patient's well-\u00adorganized write-\u00adup synthesizes informatio n from dif ferent parts of the interview. We suggest the following f ormat for recording the data: Identifying Dat a This information includes the patient's age, gender, ra ce, medical record number, telephone number of nearest relative in case of emergency and ref erral source, if a ny. Source and Reliabilit y of Info rmatio n State the source of the data (e.g., patient, parent) and their reliability, noting any concerns you might have. This signals the quality of the data to the reader. Chief Co mplaint and Agenda State the patient's most bothersome symptom (known a s the chief complaint or chief concern) using his or her words if possible and then summarize the full, negotiated agenda from Step 2 with a list. History of Present Illness The HPI is the most important part of the history and is usually written i n narrative form. In the beginning, you may simply record the chronology of symptoms as the patient reports them. A s you ga in more understanding a bout disease patterns a nd experience you should record the information in a way that will lead students and clinicia ns to the same diagnostic conclusions you are considering. Begin the section with an overview of the chief concern and other symptoms (prima ry data) that fit together to best describe the most likely underlying disease process. Indicate when each began and provide their pertinent ca rdinal f eatures. Then record the absence of relevant symptoms. In determining which symptoms are relevant, a beginning student may only consider other symptoms in the same body system as the chief complaint. As you develop a better understanding of disease, you sho uld also include symptoms from other body systems. For exa mple a beginning student may record the presence or absence of symptoms only in the Musculoskeletal and General System in a patient with arthritis who complains of fatigue, but an a dvanced student may also record the absence of gastrointestinal bleeding in the patient who is at risk because of arthritis medica tion. Next, record the releva nt positive and negative non-\u00adsymptom (secondary) data, such a s data about previous doctors and healthcare f acilities, diagnostic tests and results, treatments a nd results, specific habits, and occupation that are important f or understanding the etiology (cause), pathogenesis (mechanism) a nd prognosis of the patient's problem. Finally, record the synthesized personal data obtained from both the patient-\u00adcent ered and doctor-\u00ad centered process to display your understanding of how the patient's personal and emotional dimensions a re linked with his or her physical problem. Sometimes this link is clearly causal, but even when it is not, we can describe a personal context of the physica l problem in all patients. Other Current Active Problems (OCAP) This section contains other active problems that are unrela ted the patient's HPI. As with the HPI, these problems should be described with the appropriate primary and secondary da ta. The remainder of the write-\u00adup (Past Medical History, Psychosocial History, Family History, Review of Systems, Physical Exam, Laboratory Tests, Assessment, Problem List a nd Plan) can be recorded in an outline f orm or combination of narrative and outline form using the information obtai ned fromthe remainder of the doctor-\u00adcentered process. Problem List The problem list is a numbered listing of a ll active problems (e.g. chest pain, diabetes), past problems (e.g. s/p cholecystectomy 1998) and future risk of problems (e.g. f amily history colon cancer). Every comprehensive write-\u00adup requires a complete problem list. Every problem or disease identified within the evaluation, from HPI to ROS, is included in the problem list. In addition, unexpected abnormal f indings found on physical examination or laboratory testing are also listed in the problem list. CONCLUSION Integra ting patient-\u00adcentered interviewing with doctor-\u00adcentered interviewing results in the most complete, accura te and diagnostically powerf ul dataset - the patient's biopsychosocial story. As well, by interviewing in this way, you build a strong doctor-\u00adpa tient relationship that will be important a s you negotiate further testing and therapy for the patient's illness. The relationship itself is also therapeutic f or the patient and will improve your professional satisfaction.

VIDEO (not shown in print-\u00adout text) The Patient's View VIDEO (not shown in print-\u00adout text) The Do ctor's View Questio ns fo r Reflect ion: 1. Think about your own ways of connecting with friends a nd others. Which of these skills could you apply to building relationships with patients? 2. Which of these skills do you consider most important for building relationships with patients? 3. What attitudes do you have about yourself that might get in the way of building relationships with patients? 4. How do people see you as a person? What a re your hopes for how patients will think of you? Key Principles: 1. Relationship building is crucia l at the start of the contact but must continue throughout and be integrated with data gathering and patient educa tion 2. Relationship building ref lects a combination of non-\u00adverba l behavior (attentiveness, responsiveness and warmth) and explicit comments and questions to show a caring interest in the person, not just the medical condition 3. Relationship building interventions work best when they reflect your genuine thoughts a nd feelings 4. Relationship building interventions should be moderated by your awareness of your own biases and emotional reactions in responding to patients' personal / emotional issuesLearning go als: At the co nclusion o f this mo dule, yo u will be able to : State at least five reasons why rela tionship building is key to medical care State three key principles of relationship building Demonstrate f ive basic relationship building skills INTRODUCTION The clinician-\u00adpatient relat ionship stands as t he co rnerst one of clinical medicine. The first essential element of the interview, Build the Relatio nship, utilizes a set of emotional response skills which a re among the most important communication skills the clinician can develop. Patients expect their doctors to be knowledgeable and techni cally competent. But they also wa nt their doctors to be reassuring, supportive, and emotionally ava ilable. Clinicians with ef fective rela tionship skills will have more satisfied patients who will better a dhere to treatment recommendations. Furthermore, the clinicia n with ef fective rela tionship skills will cope with emotionally troubling situations better and will, in general, f ind the clinical practi ce of medicine more enjoyable. Such a clinician will be able to give more emotionally to patients and will, in turn, get more satisfying responses from them. There is a substantial body of evidence about the importa nce of clinicia n patient relationships in outcomes of ca re. For example, in a study of over 7000 patients, clinicians' comprehensive (\"whole person\") knowledge of patients and patients' trust in their clinician were the variables most strongly associated with a dherence, and trust was the variable most strongly a ssociated with patients' satisfaction with their clinician. (1) You can achieve a \"whole person\" knowledge of patients by building supportive, ca ring relationships. In a meta-\u00adanalysis of studies on the relationships of clinician communication and outcomes of care, clinicians' pr oviding positive aff ect, empathy and support emerged as an important factor in promoting positive patient outcomes. This study found that when clinicians ask about patients' understanding, concerns, expectations, and impact of illness on function, it leads to decreased anxiety and promotes symptom resolution. Clinicians asking about patients' f eelings leads to decreased patient distress, and when cli nicians provide support and empathy, there is both decreased patient distress and better symptom resolution. In studies of medical outcomes, when patients feel that they have been able to express themselves fully (f eelings, opinions, information), they later have improved health and functional status, and better B P control. Moreover, when patients feel there has been a full discussion of their proble ms, they experience better symptom resolution. (2) RELATIONSHIP SKILLS This module describes a group of basic relationship skills that help build doctor-\u00adpa tient rapport. Attentiveness and Warmth Attentiveness to the patient as a whole person and not just attentiveness to diagnosis and management of the diseased part of the person, is the prerequisite of all relationshipbuilding. Showing attentiveness and warmth is done through a range of non-\u00adverbal and verbal behaviors. Communicating Empathy Empathy is a term indicating one's appreciation, understanding, and acceptance of someone else's emotional situation. Respect Your respect for patients and their problems is conveyed not only by non-\u00adverbal signals, attentive listening, eye contact and genuine concern but also by explicit statements of respect for their views and praise f or their efforts. Suppo rt You should make explicit ef forts to let the patient know that you are present, personally, f or the patient and that you wish to help. Promote Part nership Patients are more satisfied and are more likely to a dhere to treatment recommendations when they f eel a sense of partnership with their clinicians. Once you learn these skills, you can integrate them into your natural style of relating. This integration provides the f oundation f or you to master higher-\u00adorder skills f or continued relationship-\u00ad building, for helping pa tients cope better with emotional d istress, and for properly managing complex and complicated situations. These include working with dying patients or those with alcohol problems or those with the most severe illnesses such as major trauma or leukemia , communicating bad news, and helping angry patients manage-\u00ad to name just a few such situations. Attentiveness and Warmth Attentiveness to the patient as a person is the prerequisite of all relationship building. Not only does the demonstration of warm attentiveness in itself create a positive impact but also all the other components of relationship building depend on attentiveness. If you do not constantly pay attention to the person as well as to diagnosis and management you will f ail to spot the appropriate moments for demonstrating empathy, respect, support and partnership. Attenti veness is demonstrated by both non-\u00adverba l and verbal behaviors. Non-\u00adverbal behavior and ' para-\u00adverbal' behavior (tone a nd pacing of speech) are the most powerful determinants of the emotional impact of any interaction. Warmth and attentiveness are demonstrated through eye contact, voice tone, nods a nd uh-\u00adhuh' s, responsive facial expression and forward posture. Attentive silence can have a powerful pos itive impact and is considered in more detail in this module' s section on empathy. A more deta iled overview of non-\u00adverbal beha vior appears in module 14. You should strive f or consistency between your verbal and nonverbal behavior. For example, if there is a disjunction between your verbal statements of concern and your nonverbal behavior, which may reflect your disapproval of a patient's behavior, you r nonverbal messa ge will usually prevail f or the patient. (3) An emerging body of resea rch supports these contentions. Doctors who establish appropriate eye contact are more likely to detect emotional distress in their patients. Doctors who perf orm better on tests of nonverbal sensitivity have patients who are more satisfied. D octors who lean f orward and have a forward head lean a nd open body posture a lso have more satisfied patients. (4)In addition, patients' nonverbal behaviors are keys to their emotional lives. Most pa tients express their emotional state through f acial expression, body posture, movement, tone of voice, inflection, and physical manifestations of autonomic nervous system reactivity (sweaty palms, flushed face, etc.). Clinicians interested in understanding their patients' emotional states will look for these signs and consider their importance at every stage of the communica tion process. In general, you should estab lish and keep comfortable eye conta ct with the patient throughout the interview. This is essential for active and eff ective listening and also to be able to observe emotional cues as they arise. As with a ll rules, there are exceptions: angry, suspicious, a nd/or paranoid patients can perceive steady eye contact as provocative. Thoughtf ul attention to the use of space also f acilitates rapport. Vertica l space between doctor and patient should be minimized (e.g., not standing while the patient sits) and horizontal space should be caref ully pla nned (e.g., not too close or too far). The power of the various relationship building skills you will master, and the intimacy and social power differentials that accompany caring f or people who are ill and vulnerable require you to be especia lly mindful of approp riate boundaries in your doctor - patient relationships. Doctors' skills repertoire needs to include respectful ways of reinforcing those bounda ries if and when the need arises. (module 41) Verbal demonstration of attentiveness is largely through 'active listening' (described in more detail in module 8, \"Gather Information\"). Active listening includes ' continuers' (encouraging comments) such as 'please tell me more' and reflection (repetition) of key phrases used by the pa tient (\"I see ...the pain was severe\"). Expression of your own emotional response to the patient's experience (e.g., \"my goodness .. how a wful\") can also be a powerf ul wa y to indicate attentiveness. However, your expressions of emotion must be titrated so that they do not burden or distract the patient. Empathy Empathy is a term indicating one person' s appreciation, understanding, and acceptance of someone else's emotional situation, inner experience and perspectives. When a clinician communicates this understanding, the patient feels heard, understood and accepted, and that the clinician has tried to \"walk a mile in my shoes\" The communica tion of empathy is one of the most helpf ul, meaningf ul, and comforting interventions one person can have with someone else. A parent soothes an upset child by letting the child know that the distress is understood, appreciated, a nd accepted. Friends ca n do the same. Similarly, a clinician can build ra pport and respond to patients' emotions best by the communication of empathy. (5) Sometimes clinicians are reluctant to encourage the patient to express feelings more deeply by expressing empathy. They may f eel that this will open a \"Pandora's box\" of emotions or that empathic comments will \"push\" patients to express f eelings that they might otherwise wish to keep private. Research suggests though, that it is helpful and supportive to allow patients some opportunities for the ventilation of feelings that are near the \"surf ace\" of awareness. Such interventions help develop rapport and trust. And contra ry to the worry that expressions of empathy can unnecessarily prolong the interview, there is evidence tha t a little empathy goes a long way (6), a nd can make your interactions with patients more ef ficient. The communica tion of an empathic understa nding a patient's predicament is clearly the most important relationship-\u00adbuilding skill the clinicia n can possess. There a re many differe nt ways to communicate empathy eff ectively. The challenge of learning empathic skills lies in the ability to master basic interventions a nd to integrate these into a natural interpersonal style that feels genuine to you and, as such, is likely to be perceived as genuine by the patient.Nonverbal behaviors can sometimes communicate empathy more eff ectively than can concrete statements. A sympa thetic look, attentive silence, a nd a hand on the shoulder can a ll accomplish a great deal towa rds letting the pa tient know you are emotionally in tune with the pa tient's distress. Genuine interest in the patient' s life, feelings, worries, expectations and hopes communicate empathy. Most students and clinicians already possess natural empa thic abilities, but the challenges of medical practice often require the development of additional skills. Clinicians need to ask patients about very persona l issues, and pa tients will often tell their clinicia ns things they tell no one else, such as sexual problems or stories of physical and sexual abuse. It takes learning specif ic skills, practice and experience to become comfortable eliciting and listening to patients' most personal concerns. A word on attentive silence: It is a valuable skill: it wordlessly communica tes concern, interest and respect. It counters the impressions many patients hold that \"doctors don't listen to their patients.\" It gives patients an opening to discuss their most troubling issues. When a patient interrupts a narrative and f alls silent, or expresses a strong emotion, it is wise to remain silent. If the silence lasts more than about 5 seconds, you can gently say, \"what are you feeling?\" or \"are you able to talk about it?\" Most beginning learners have great dif ficulty with attentive silence, often feeling the need to change the subject or reassure the patient. B ut attentive silence has many rewards for patient and clinician Click on the picture-\u00adbutton on the left to experience the nonverbal skill of attentive silence. This chapter describes two operational components of empathic communication, \"ref lection\" and \"legitimation,\" that can be used to facilitate your responses to patients' emotional distress. Reflection refers to your description of the emotion experienced by the patient and legitimation refers to the clinician 's confirmation that the emotion is understood and accepted. Empathy: Reflect ion Reflection is a fundamental relationship skill used in everyday encounters between friends a nd family members. The power of reflection is emphasized in the writings of Carl Rogers and other authors. Here, reflection refers to a clinician's acknowledgement of an observed feeling or emotion in a patient. (7) If you notice that a patient begins to look sad when discussing the illness of a parent, examples of ways you can \"reflect\" this feeling include the f ollowing: Clinician:You look sad right now. or I can see this is upsetting to you. or This is hard to talk about.This type of reflective comment usually helps you communicate empathic concern f or the patient's emotional situation. In practical terms, such comments usually give patients permission to talk more about their f eelings. Patients often then go on to revea l important information that helps you better understand their illnesses. Click on the picture-\u00adbutton on the left to see an example of reflectio n. The specific words you use are much less important than the f act that you have interrupted the factual exchange of information to notice and respond to the patient's emotional state. This is a critically important event in the building of a relationship with a patient a nd demonstrates to the patient tha t you are concerned about th e patient as a person and his or her emotional experiences. When you make reflective comments a bout sadness, patients will often begin to cry, which can make you uncomf ortable, and wa nt to either \"f ix\" the problem, reassure the patient, or change the topic. However, a patient's crying is a good sign - it indicates that the patient trusts you. Also, crying in the presence of a caring clinicia n is often therapeutic f or patients. It is best to respond to patients' tears with attentive silence, a nd offering a tissue. After you ma ke reflective comments, patients may indicate that they do not wish to discuss their emotional reactions, and you should of course respect these desires. It is important however, tha t you do not confuse your own discomfort or desire to avoid emotiona l issues with the inference that it is the patient who wishes to a void these topics. Sometimes, patients are reluctant to talk about difficult emotional issues because of guilt or shame (8), or their worry that you will not be open to listening, or might be judgmental. Often, a comment such a s, \"it's pretty hard to talk about this...\" followed by attentive silence, will reassure the patient and enable them to disclose their f eelings. On the other hand, if you do not acknowledge a patient's manifest feelings, the patient will f eel less understood and unconf irmed. Such feelings undermine doctor-\u00adpatient ra pport and actually interfere with collection of data. One of the cardinal rules of good interviewing is the f ollowing: Respo nd to a pat ient's feeling as so on as it appears Remember that reflective comments can be utilized several times as a patient discusses and experiences feelings. One reflective comment may be insufficient. In fact, as a patient expresses emotional reactions, the specific feeling expressed may change in quality a nd degree. For example, a patient who seems sad at first may eventually express anger or frustration or vice versa. If the clinician listens carefully, the initial f eeling ca n be acknowledged and su bsequent ones reflected as they emerge. Such attention to patients' feelings seldom requires excessive time, and may contribute to efficient interviews by removing emotional obstacles to full disclosure of symptoms a nd circumstances. Clinicians trained in responding to patients' feelings can have profound effects in relieving emotional distress without lengthening the medical visits. (9) If the emotio nal issues become too complex to address in the interview time a vailable, you can acknowledge the signif icance of the feelings and ma ke arrangements to deal with the emotional issues at a later, but acceptable date.Alternately, a suitable other approach, e.g., a psychiatric, psychological, or social work referral, could be arranged. Empathy: Legit imation Legitimation, or validation, is closely related to reflection but specifically communicates acceptance of the patient's emotional experience a nd respect for it. After you have ca refully listened to a patient's discussion of an emotiona l situation, you can then let the patient know that the feelings are understandable and make sense. Examples of validating commen ts would be: Clinician:\"I can certainly understand why you' d be upset under the circumstances.\" or \"Anyone would find this very dif ficult.\" or \"Your reactions are perfectly normal.\" or \"This would be anxiety provoking for anyone.\" or \"I can understand why you're so angry.\" Click on the picture-\u00adbutton on the left to see an example of legit imat ion. With respect to valida ting the feelings of someone who is angry, making a legitimizing statement does not mean that you agree with the reasons for the anger. The point is that you are trying to understand this anger f rom the patient's point of view. Once you have understood the anger, you can communicate this understanding to th e patient. This is sometimes difficult to do if you disa gree with or feel irritated or threatened by an angry patient. Nevertheless, ref lective and validating comments ca n play the same helpful role with angry patients as they do with sad or anxious patients. For example, if the patient is angry because he or she has been waiting too long, you might say: Clinician:\"I can see that you are f rustra ted be cause you've been waiting so long. I understand why you are angry. I apologize for tha t.\" These principles a re highlighted again in module 13. Respect Attentive listening, nonverbal signals, eye contact, and genuine concern show that you respect your patient and his or her problems. Ma king explicit respectful comments further builds rapport, improves the relationship, and helps the patient cope with difficult situations.For the purposes of this text, an intervention communicating respect refers to a specific endorsement for a specif ic patient beha vior. Statements of respect which validate patient behaviors will, in general, tend to reinforce the behavior, i.e. make it more likely to happen again. Frequent demonstrations of respect will foster a positive relationship and promote the patients' capacity for coping. Click on the picture-\u00adbutton on the left to see an example of respect . Clinicians ca n usually f ind something to praise in all their patients. Most everyone does something well. This holds true even for patients with troubling or diff icult behaviors (cf. module 13). Doctors can help their patients by focusing on one or more of their patient's successf ul coping skills. This will improve patient satisfacti on and adherence. Examples of respectful statements would be: Clinician:\"I'm impressed by how well you' re coping.\" or \"You're doing a grea t job of managing your diabetes!\" or \"Despite this chronic pain, you're still able to carry on at home and at work. That is quite a n accomplishment.\" Like all the other interventions discussed above, statements of respect must be honest, or they will be more destruct ive than helpf ul. When these sentiments reflect true f eelings of the clinician, however, they are powerful facilitators of improved communica tion and rapport between doctors and pa tients. Comment fo r medical st udents and resident s: Depending on your level of training, you ma y be aware of a \"hidden curriculum\"-\u00ad wha t you learn about attitudes and behaviors toward patients from other residents and attendi ng clinicians. Some residents and attendings may call patients names such as \"gomers\" or \"crocks.\" They may be abrupt with patients or avoid difficult conversations. They may not demonstrate the kind of empathy and concern that you would want to have in your relationships with patients, or tha t you would want for your loved ones if they were ill. Some residents and attendings will deride your interest in patients as irrelevant, perhaps describing it as \"warm and f uzzy.\" If you are a trainee, it is easy to fall into the rhythm of a preva lent culture, and to develop cynicism a nd doubt. If you practice the relationship skills in this module, and realize the value of connecting more deeply with patients; if you experience the positive eff ects tha t your skills have on your understanding of patients' illnesses a nd their well-\u00adbeing, you are more able to withstand the pressures of the \"hidden curriculum.\" Perso nal Suppo rt The clinician should make explicit statements that express that he or she is there, persona lly, for the patient and wants to help. This of course must be an honest statement, or it will not be eff ective. Statements like the following indicate personal support:Click on the picture-\u00adbutton on the left to see an example of personal support. Clinician:\"I want to help in any way I can.\" or \"No matter what happens, I will be doing whatever I can to assist you.\" or, \"The reason I'm here is because I a m concerned about your health, and I want to do whatever is needed to ensure that you stay healthy,\" (or, \"...tha t you recover,\" or, \"...that you suff er as little as possible.\") The assurance of direct personal support is partidcularly importa nt when situations are changing rapidly or in those situations where there is considerable uncertainty about diagnosis or treatment, or where anxiety or tension or conflict is para mount. Your statement of personal involvelment means a lot, and leads to improved rapport and solidification of the doctor-\u00adpatient relationship. Partnership Patients are more satisfied with clinicians and are more likely to a dhere to treatment recommendations when their clinicians a ssure them that they are working in close partnership, and tha t the clinicia ns are as attentive to the patients' needs and requests as to the technological or biomedical demands of the situation. Truly working together as partners cannot occur unless clinician and pati ent agree on an understanding of the task in hand. The first task is the process of the interview itself. It ma y sometimes theref ore be helpful for the clinician to offer brief explana tions in a dvance of certa in components of the interview such as the inquiry into personal and social f actors. A n example might be, \"It would be helpful to know a bit about your personal circumstances because sometimes thi s has a bearing on how best to sort out your problem.\" (module 5) Increasing the participation of the patient in his or her own treatment improves the patient's coping skills and improves the likelihood of good outcome from illness processes. Clinicians' work is much easier when patients sense a clea r joining together to find the best solutions, especially for thorny and dif ficult problems. Click on the picture-\u00adbutton on the left to see statements of respect and partnership.Physicans can promote this type of partnership, by ma king statements like the following: Clinician:\"Let's work together in developing a trea tment plan once I have reviewed some of the options with you.\" or, \"After we've talked some more about your problems, perhaps together we can work out some solutions tha t may help.\" or, \"I'll need your help as we go along, to be certain that I fully understand your ideas and your concerns about situa tions that come up-\u00ad-\u00adthis is about your health, and I want to be sure we are working in synch with each other.\" AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) Behavio r Checklist 1.

What might keep you from allowing patients to state all their concerns at the beginning of the interview? 2. Setting a visit agenda with a patient requires organiza tion and prioritization. How confident are you in these abilities? How could you improve these abilities in your patient interviews? Key Principles: 1. Patients typically present with more than one concern and rarely discuss them in order of their priority.2. You can enhance your ef ficiency, diagnostic a ccuracy, and patient satisfaction by using time-\u00ad saving communication strategies to elicit a comprehensive list of the patients' symptoms and concerns. 3. You can enhance patient participation in the encounter by facilitating the development of a mutually agreed upon agenda that includes both the patient's a nd your priorities. Learning go als: Learners will implement strategies to elicit all patient concerns, and to reach agreement on collaboratively constructed visit agendas. At the co nclusion o f this mo dule, yo u will be able to : Discuss the importa nce and rationale for eliciting all patient concerns to establish, through negotiation when necessa ry, the visit agenda. Discuss and implement communication strategies a t the beginning of each medical encounter to elicit a comprehensive list of patients' concerns. Discuss and implement communication strategies to prioritize and rea ch agreement on the agenda. Identify personal ba rriers to the elicitation of concerns, a nd the risks of failure to do so. OPEN THE DISCUSSION: BASICS Introduce yo urself If you have not met the patient previously, it is important to introduce yourself and your role on the healthcare team, including identification a s a student or resident if appropriate. Allow the patient to complete the opening statement s witho ut int erruptio n Once you have a sked pa tients about the reasons for their visits, wait without interrupting until you've heard the complete response. Survey all sympto ms and concerns before fo cusing o n one issue Patients in the ambulatory setting have an average of 3 concerns per off ice visit. Introduce yo urself If you have not met the patient previously, it is important to introduce yourself and your role on the health care team, including identification a s a student or resident if appropriate. Patients appreciate the respect demonstra ted by addressing them by their last names, and using their titles (e.g. Mr., Dr., Reverend) when appropriate. If uncertain, you can ask patients how they would like to be addressed. If you address patients by their first names when they address you by your title, an implicitimbalance of power is created that can a ffect the nature of the relationships and may convey to patients a sense of disrespect and diminishment. If you are a medical student or resident, it is best to identify yourself as such: \"Hi, I' m -\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad, a third year student on your medical team.\" \"Hi I'm D r. -\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad, a surgical resident. I' ll talk with you about your problems and do a physical exam, and then Dr. -\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad, the attending clinician will be in to see you.\" Allow patients to complete o pening st atements witho ut int errupting Each clinical encounter begins with the clinician's invitation to the patient to sha re the symptoms and concerns. Once you have asked a patient a bout the reasons for the visit, wait without interrupting until you've heard the complete response. Waiting until patients complete their opening statements has a number of benefits. Patients feel heard, and understand you a re interested in their stories. It conveys to patients that they should do more of the talking, and may encourage them to give you a fuller account of their symptoms and concerns. It also encourages patients to express their f ull range of concerns, which they may not do if interrupted. Numerous studies of medical students, residents, and experienced clinicians demonstrate early interruption by clinic ians, usually within 18-\u00ad23 seconds of the patient beginning their opening statement. (1 ,2) In the recent study by Marvel and collea gues (2), clinicians of fered patients the opportunity to complete their statements of symptoms and concerns in only 23-\u00ad28% of visits (2). Patients who were allowed to complete the expression of their concerns took an average of 32 seconds to do so, and interviews in which the complete a genda was solicited lasted only 6 seconds longer (2). In another recent study, patients' mean spontaneous talking time was 92 seconds a nd 78% of patients f inished their opening statements within two minutes (3 ). Clinician interruptions and unilateral direction of the agenda may be one explanation for the findings of Stewart et al., that doctors failed to elicit 54% of patients' reasons for coming to the doctor a nd 45% of their worries (4). Marvel and colleagues f ound that once the clinician focused the discussion on a particular concern, the likelihood of seeking additional concerns was quite low (8%) (2 ). Survey all sympto ms and concerns befo re fo cusing o n one issue. Patients in the ambulatory setting have an average of 3 concerns per off ice visit (5 ,6). Survey all of the patient's symptoms and concerns briefly at the beginning of the interview before exploring any one in depth. This habit is helpful and important in both inpatient and outpatient settings. You may assume that the patient's first stated concern is the most importa nt one. In fact, concerns are infrequently revealed by patients in order of their importa nce to them (8 ). They may withhold their most important concerns or emotionally laden topics until they feel they can trust you, f eel confident that you really want to know their concerns, or until you bring up the topic (9 ). Elstein and colleagues f ound, in their classical analysis of medical problem solving, that experienced, competent clinicians begin generating tentative hypotheses very early in patientencounters from clusters of clues. They revise their hypotheses as additional information is obtained (7). Effective hypothesis generation depends on the clues obtained from the patient and how the clinician organizes and analyzes them. Theref ore, an initia l comprehensive survey of concerns may enhance diagnostic efficiency and accura cy. COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES TO ELICIT CONCERNS Facilitat ing the patient 's uninterrupted statement Start with open questions to elicit, without interruptions, the patient's reasons f or the off ice visit. Use the core skill: Ask, \"What else?\" After the patient finishes his or her opening statement, direct the patient to state additional concerns, by asking \"What else?\" Direct and redirect the patient to establish the full list of concerns This interviewing technique requires a ctive direction by the clinician. Ask abo ut bo th physical and psychosocial sympt oms and concerns At the beginning and throughout the medical interview, remember to elicit the patient's concerns, fears, hopes and expectations a s well as the physical symptoms that prompted the patient's visit or hospitaliza tion. Summarize and add clinician concerns Once the pa tient's full list of concerns has been elicited, summarize them back to the patient to check that the list is correct and complete. Facilitat ing the patient 's opening st atement Start with open questions to elicit the patient's reasons for the office visit or symptoms that prompted hospitalization, such as, \"What brings you in today?\" \"Open\" questions require explanation and elaboration. \"Closed\" or specific questions can be answered with yes/no, or a few words. Explain the process Explain to the patient that your initia l goal is to create a full list of concerns in order to plan how best to use the time availa ble for the encounter. You will make a more detailed explora tion of concerns af ter you and the patient have a chance to understand the full range of concerns. The f ull range will i nclude whatever the patient says, as well as concerns that you have, which the patient may not be aware of or attuned to; such as an abnormal laboratory f inding or discussion of prevention issues. Use the core skill: Ask, \"What else?\" Following the opening statement, you then direct the patient to state additional concerns, by asking \"What else?\" You may continue prompting the patient by asking \"what else\" or using a class of linguistic devices called \"continuers,\" such a s \"mmh\", \"I see\" or \"I understand.\" Patients will often mark the end of their list of concerns by saying \"That's all.\" Checking with the patient by asking, \"Are you sure that's all?\" or \"I have the feeling tha t there might be something else\" encourages the p atient to reveal their hidden concerns a nd agendas. Direct and redirect the patient to establish the full list of concerns This interviewing technique requires a ctive direction by the clinician. Patients usually begin telling the full story of each concern, instead of simply listing the name or \"title\" of the concern (back pain, sleep problems, etc). Sometimes it is usef ul to interrupt a nd make a clarifying statement such as, \"This sounds like an importa nt concern to you. I will return to it but first I' d like to hear if there are any other concerns that you would like me to know about?\" You may need to redirect the pa tient several times, and repeatedly ask \"What else?,\" until the patient completes their list of concerns. You may be uncomf ortable with the directiveness required in developing the li st. However, patients generally wish to assist your a ttempts to understand their problems, a nd readily adapt to this method especially when it is explained in a dvance. Many will begin coming to subsequent visits with their lists prepa red. Ask abo ut bo th physical and psycho social sympto ms and co ncerns At the beginning and throughout the medical interview, continue your elicitation of patient's concerns, fears, hopes and expectations a s well as the physical symptoms that prompted the visit or hospitalization. As noted previously, the first symptom or concern expressed by the patient in the office or hospital setting may not be the only one, or the most important either to you or the patient (8 ). Patients frequently have underlying concerns and requests which they are not comfortable divulging until they feel comfortable in the relationship with the clinicia n (9). Patients are more likely to express themselves, whether during brief encounters or ongoing relationships, when you care enough to ask, listen to their responses, a nd indicate willingness to help or to get help for them. Examples of patients' unvoiced agenda items include worries about possible diagnoses and illness, their seriousness and wha t to expect, ideas about the cause of their symptoms, side effects of treatments or medications, and social information (10 ). You can a sk directly: \"What are you most worried about,\" or comment on their expressed emotions, \"You seem pretty upset about these symptoms.\" Patients' expression of these worries and concerns may engender painf ul feelings such as sadness or a nger. You must be prepared to attend to these emotions before completing the agenda. (module 6, \"Build the Relationship\" and module 9 \"Understands the Patie nt's Perspective\" explore this issue in more detail.) Sometimes patients themselves are not aware or can't describe what's bothering them physically or psychologically.The unta ngling of the patient's symptoms and their associated worries may emerge during the course of the interview. If you don't understand the full scope of reasons why the patient has come to seek medical help, you won't be able to adequately diagnose or provide what the patient desires and needs. This may result in poor outcomes for both pa tient and clinician. Incomplete solicitation of symptoms or concerns is also associated with patient concerns arising late in ambulatory interviews, d ecrea sed time management efficiency (12 ), and failure to expose hidden agendas (13). In addition, misunderstandings and non-\u00adadherence to prescribed treatments ma y arise when patients' ideas, symptoms and concerns are not fully identified (14 ). Patients who leave a visit with unvoiced desires and unfulfilled requests report being less satisfied with their ca re (15,16,17). Summarize and add clinician co ncerns Once you elicit the patient' s full list of concerns, summarize them back to the patient to check that the list is correct and complete. After checking with your paitent, add your own issues (e.g., your concern about a lab test or a prevention issue, or something the patient overlooked) and begin the process of negotiating and agreeing on the agenda f or the encoun ter. The following table lists questions and other skills that facilitate your eliciation of all patient concerns: Communicat ion strategy Example clinician statements Ask open questions \"What brings you in today?\" Allow uninterrupted opening statement Explain the process\"I would like to make a list of all of your concerns before we f ocus on any one them.\" Redirect \"I'll get back to that.\" \"What else is on y our list?\" Use continuer \"What else?\" Ask about both physical and psychosocial issues\"How has this illness aff ected you?\" Summarize patient and clinician concerns\"Let me see if I have everything.... I also need to check on...\" Reaching an agreement Prioritize and nego tiate the visit agenda with the patient Since time is usually limited, the patient and you must agree on the visit priorities and negotiate the agenda , if necessary. Patient and clinician barriers to nego tiating an agenda Clinicians worry that eliciting all concerns is ineff icient. Clinicians worry that once they name all the concerns they will have to address each one. Patients a re often confused about the process, initia lly. Risks of inco mplete agenda set ting If you attempt to get all the issues on the agenda early, fewer patients will raise important concerns just as you prepare to conclude the interview. Time is wasted and interviews prolonged when pa tients bring up new concerns later in encounters. Sometimes issues of critical importance to health and to adherence, such as domestic violence, a lcohol problems, lack of funds and so on never surface if agenda-\u00adsetting is incomplete. Prioritize and nego tiate t he visit agenda with t he patient In most clinical settings time is limited, and ta king time to set an agenda results in more efficient and more patient-\u00adcentered interviews. In the outpatient setting, you must a ttend to a cute problems, following-\u00adup on previous problems, counseling and prevention. In both ambulatory and hospital settings, you must oft en discuss diagnostic procedures and complex medical regimens and surgical procedures. You may have to use specific stra tegies to reach agreement on the agenda for the encounter depending upon the number or complexity of concerns and the time allotted for in-\u00adpatient discussions or ambulatory visits (Figure 2). Because scheduled time may not allow evaluation of every concern, it is essential tha t both the patient and you prioritize the concerns. Whatever concerns ca nnot be addressed at that time may be followed up at subsequent encounters. You may begin this segment by asking patients to rank order their top priorities among the full list of concerns elicited earlier in the discussion. At this point, you s hould state and explain any urgent or important biomedical or psychosocial issues you have identified during the discussion or based on additional clinical data available. If these issues could adversely impact the patient's health and require immedia te or timely attention, you must address them during the present interaction in accordance with your proessiona l responsibility. You can frame the proces s of reaching agreement on the agenda by telling patients the amount of time allocated f or the encounter. This may be expressed in minutes or as a brief, intermediate, or comprehensive appointment. Time-\u00adf raming is a useful strategy to help clarify what issues can reasonably be discussed in the allotted time. Part of agreeing on an agenda is to \"flag\" some issues f or follow-\u00adup at subsequent scheduled visits. When you are explicit about this process, you indica te to patients that their concerns have been heard and will be systema tically addressed over time. Figure 2. Reach a greement on the visit a genda Communicat ion strategy Example clinician statements Ask patients to state their priorities\"Among your concerns, what a re your highest priorities today?\" State urgent clinical issues as priorities\"I am quit e concerned about your blood pressure of 200/100 which I think we must a ddress today.\" State time available\"We have 15 minutes (or intermediate visit) today. Which of your priorities did you want to be sure we addressed today, given the time available?\" Reach agreement and summarize\"Let's start by talking about our two top priorities: your blood pressure and your sleep problems.\" Reassure that other concerns will be addressed later.\"We can a ddress the remaining concerns at the next visit.\"Patient and clinician barriers to nego tiating an agenda; risks o f inco mplete agenda set ting Clinicians often believe they have no time or insuff icient reason to elicit all patient concerns and negotiate a mutually agreed upon agenda. Research suggests tha t caref ul agenda-\u00adsetting improves ef ficiency, diagnostic accura cy, and pa tient satisfaction. Patients allowed to complete their list of concerns usua lly take only 32 - 150 seconds to do so (1-\u00ad 3). A comprehensive initial survey improves ef ficiency, as it diminishes the likelihood of hearing a bout important new issues (like chest pain) late in the interview, just when the visit seemed about to end (1,2). Such late arising concerns frequently prolong medical encounters. The elicita tion of all concerns reduces the frequency of late arising concerns by more than half (34.9% vs. 14.9%) (2). You enhance diagnostic a ccuracy by surveying patients' concerns and reacing agreement on priorities. Patients' initial complaints may not predict the problems truly important to them, according to research that ranked problems af ter encounters were f inished. Burack and Carpenter showed that the patient's chief complaint predicted the patient's primary problem only 6% of the time f or psychosocial problems, and 76% of the time f or biomedical problems (18). Many clinicians shy away f rom eliciting and hearing numerous patient concerns, because they feel compelled to do something about each one, or because they don't feel comfortable responding to patients' emotions. Patients often simply want you to hear and understand their concerns, not necessarily to act upon them (8). The concerns that do require f urther attention may be dealt with in subsequent visits. Patients are often confused by the interruptions and redirecting of clinicians when intially participating in this process. They respond very positively to compassionate explanations, such as the following: \"I see from your reaction that this seems a bit odd or conf usiing , but I am very concerned and want to make our time together as effective as possible in meeting your needs.\" and, \"Many of my patients did not like this work at first, but setting the agenda has helped us work very well as a team.\" AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) CONCLUSION Patients usually present to primary care off ices with a n average of three concerns. Elicitation of all of the patient's symptoms and concerns in the ambulat ory and in-\u00adpatient setting requires little a dditional time and diminishes the likelihood of late arising concerns or hidden agendas. In addition, this strategy may enhance diagnostic accuracy. You can use the strategy of beginning with an open question and allowing patients to complete their opening statements without interruption to begin the elicitation of a comprehensive list of symptoms and concern s. You can then use continuers, such a s \"what else?\" and direct patients to provide a complete list of concerns before discussing any one issue in depth. You include your agenda items and use the strategies of time-\u00adframing and priority negotiation to establish the visit agenda. In this manner, you ca n efficiently establish a realistic, prioritized agenda for the visit. Remaining concerns ca n be attend ed to in scheduled continuity care visits.Clinicians who explain this process at the beginning of the visit and rea ch agreement about a mutually constructed agenda enable patients to collaborate and pa rticipate in their care.

INTRODUCTION You can greatly improve your patients' outcomes when you jointly construct the story of the illness, weaving the patient's elabora tion of the biomedical and psychosocial threads together with your own hypotheses. The medical enco unter begins when two people enter into a relat ionship wit h hopes o f understanding, help, and healing. One of the major functions of all medical encounters is the development of a relationship between the clinician and patient tha t enables them both to realize these hopes. Skillful clinicians efficiently gather accurate biomedical and psycho social info rmatio n to generate hypotheses about possible causes of the patient's symptoms, while gaining an understanding of the patient's experi ence of illness. They listen for and develop the \"narrative threads,\" (1 ) or subplots and clues a bout the patient's disease and the personal meaning of illness, weaving them together into the tapestry of the clinica l history. This appro ach co mbines t he patient 's vo ice with the clinician's elabo ratio n of the medical details. The result is a jointly constructed story that integrates the world of the clinicia n and the world of the patient. The primary goals o f relat ionship-\u00adce ntered informat ion gathering The primary goa ls of information gathering are to elicit biomedica l and psychosocial information in order to generate clinica l hypotheses, and to understand the context and impact of the patient's illness. Your skills in accomplishing these goa ls will help you to build a more effective patient-\u00addoctor partnership. These goals are accomplished when the clinician: Has a sufficient medical knowledge base. Values the importance of understanding the pa tient as a person as well a s the patient's disease processes. Efficiently pursues critical information and clues a bout the biomedical, psychosocial, and subjective aspects of the patient's symptoms and illness. Encourages the patient's active participa tion in exploring medical and psychosocial information. These goals and premises fo rm the foundatio n of a relatio nship-\u00adcentered appro ach t o communicat ion and care (2). We call this a relationship-\u00adcentered approach because it combines the expertise, values and needs of the patient with those of the clinician.Informatio n gat hering skills and o utcomes Patients who feel t hey have been able t o fully express their sympto ms, co ncerns, opinio ns, and questio ns have more symptom resolution, less role a nd physical limitations, improved functional status, and improved health outcomes such a s blood pressure and blood glucose level. Communicatio n training designed to enhance clinicians' understanding of the patient as a person and ability to share control of the medical encounter by encouraging the patient' s participation, can lead to signif icant improvement in these interviewing skills and result in increased patient satisfaction.(3 ) Patients' a nxiety and symptoms are reduced when clinicians a re trained to ask about patients' understanding of the nature and impact of their problems as well as their concerns a nd expectations.(4 ,5) Research by Roter et al. showed that skills tra ining designed to teach clinicians to delineate the patient' s problem by starting with open-\u00adended questions, using f acilita tive statements to help patients tell their stories in their own words, and assessing the effect of the patient's problem on psychosocial f unctioning did not increase length of visits, a nd reduced patients' emotiona l distress.(6 ) Patients who f eel they have been able to fully express their symptoms, concerns, opinions, and questions have more symptom resolution, less role and physical limitations, improved f unctional status, and improved health outcomes such as blood pressure and blood glucose.(7 ,8,9,10) These studies support the goal of teaching clinicians to share control of the discussion and to facilitate patients' talking about their concerns and the impact of illness. Primary vs. seco ndary so urces o f info rmatio n When t ime is sho rt, relying on t he \"o ld chart,\" is t empt ing. Secondary information may be helpful or inaccurate, and can never supplant a personal interaction. Before we begin to di scuss how to gather information, let's consider the validity of the various sources f rom which clinical histories are obtained. This may sound obvious, but whenever possible, you should elicit the patient's story directly f rom the patient. In the clinica l years of training, you often read or hear a snapshot of the patient's history from a triage nurse, a house off icer, or the patient's old medical re cord bef ore speaking with the pa tient. It's tempting to rely on the summaries of others, or to rewrite previous histories from the \"old chart\" especia lly when time is short. Secondary information is often quite helpf ul, but may be incomplete, inaccurate or biased. It's impo rtant to formulat e your own independent o pinio n abo ut the patient 's situation based upon primary dat a; yo ur int erview wit h the pat ient, his o r her family, or caretakers. Organize the interview flo w in the time allo tted Learn and practice strategies for coping with time limitations. There is evidence that the duration of the avera ge U.S. office visit has a ctually increased, f rom about 16 minutes in 1989 to 21 minutes in 2005. However, the number of issues addressed in primary care visits has increa sed to a grea ter extent than h as visit duration, resulting in lessavailable time to address individua l problems.(11 , Abbo ED, Zhang Q, Zelder M, Huang ES. The increasing number of clinical items addressed during the time of adult primary care visits. J Gen Intern Med. Dec 2008;23(12):2058-\u00ad2065.) We can enhance our time management by using a n organized approach to new patient and health maintenance visits, and by trying to establish the agenda a nd goals of a visit early in the encounter (Module 7). This does not mean, however, tha t we must stick to a rigid format or a genda. On the contra ry, relationship-\u00adcentered interviewing requires f lexibility as the clinicia n continues to elicit and respond to the patient's symptoms, concerns and needs throughout the interview. The process of exploring the patient's history as it unfolds, agreeing on the goals of the visit, redef ining them when new problems arise during the conversation, letting the patient know how much time is available, and explaining transitions between topics are all helpf ul and respectful strategies f or efficient time management. Understand the \"Chief Co mplaint\" and expand t he \"Hist ory of Present Illness\" (HPI) Thoughtf ul attention to story elements enables you to decide which hypotheses and ideas you should probe to the fullest extent. The medical interview begins with the elicit ation of the patient's primary sympto ms and concerns. This has traditionally been called the patient' s \"Chief Complaint\" or reason for admission when speaking with hospitalized patients. It is usually the answer to the question, \"What broug ht you to the hospital?\" or, \"How can I help you today?\" Ambulatory patients may come to the office with one or several acute, subacute or ongoing problems. Furthermore, as we learned in module 7 \"Open the discussion,\" patients may not a lways tell their clinicians their underlying \"Chief Compla int\" right away, especially if their primary concern is psychosocial rather than biomedical.(12 ) Once the clinician has elicited the patient's concerns, the interview proceeds with an inquiry into the agreed upon agenda items. In hospita lized patients, the clinician surveys all of the patient's concerns and symptoms in a similar fashion before exploring a ny particular symptom in depth during the explora tion of the \"History of Present Illness.\" The \"Hist ory of Present Illness,\" (HPI) o r descript ion of the patient's current sympto ms, is one of the most diff icult and importa nt aspects of the patient's story. A ll of the information needed to formulate and test hypotheses a bout the pa tient's disease and the psychosocial context of the patient's illness must be elicited whether the patient is in the hospital or in the outpatient setting. The patient's diagnostic eva luation and subsequent treatment plan is based on the \"HPI\". Therefore, it's important tha t the HPI be elicited caref ully in detail, and presented clearly to others. COMMUNICATION SKILLS that impro ve info rmatio n gat hering Practice and utilize these skills, a nd your competence at information gathering will steadily improve. Clinicians use many different communication skills to gather information eff ectively and eff iciently. In this sec tion we will f ocus on 6 skills:Use an o pen to closed question strategy Start interviews with open questions, because patients respond by revealing relevant (of ten surprising) information more rea dily than to closed questions. Develo p the timeline o f the illness Ask patients to tell you the story of their illnesses from the beginning, and fa cilitate their story telling until you understand how an illness progressed f rom the onset until the present. Characterize sympt oms Learn to ask for all the details about key symptoms in the patient's story. Listen actively o n multiple levels Practice \"listening on multiple levels;\" use verbal and nonverbal encouragements for your patient to speak, and use silence ef fectively. Clarify meaning Clarify important words that may have different meanings for you and for your patient. Summarize Summarize, to communicate your attentiveness, to encourage your patient to clarify and to discover any gaps in understa nding. Redirectio n and transit ions Respectfully guide the interview by redirecting the patient and by using tra nsitional statements. Use an o pen to closed question strategy Begin with o pen questio ns Start interviews with open questions, because patients respond by revealing relevant (of ten surprising) information more rea dily than to closed questions. Effective interviewers begin with open questions until they have an overview of the patient' s story. Open questions require some explana tion or description. They cannot be answered with single words or yes/no responses. You might tell the patient tha t you would like to hear a brief summary of what happened before you begin to ask detailed questions. You can elicit much of the content of the HPI using this open-\u00adended method of questioning. Open questions revea l substantially more relevant information than closed questions and are therefore a more ef ficient way to begin the interview.(13 ) Patients a re the only true experts on what has happened to them. You can a sk an endless series of closed or specific questions to try to get closer and closer to their experiences, but it's faster a nd simpler to just a sk patients to describe it for you. A \"high control,\" closed questioning clinician style can result in a n incomplete database.(14 ) For example, let' s suppose a patient says she has chest pain. If your next question is, \"Is it sharp or dull?\" the patient may assume she has to pick one of these adjectives, which may not accura tely ref lect her physical sensation at all. Or, she may say, \"neither,\" leaving you in the position of having to present severa l alternative description choices until it is closer to her experience. You might need to ask a multitude of closed questions to accura tely understand the series of events or physical sensations the patient has experienced, which is an ineff icient use of time. Two t ypes o f open questio nsThere a re two types of open questions: general open questions, and focused open questions. You use general, open questions to begin an inquiry when the territory or range of concerns is unknown. This type of question allows patients to begin their stories at the point tha t feels most important or most comf ortable. Focused, open questions allow patients to continue to unfold their stories, but on a f ocused topic of interest to the interviewer. Genera l, open question: \"Can you tell me what brings you in today?\" Focused, open question: \"Can you tell me more about your chest pain?\" Use clo sed questions to probe det ails Once you have a sked enough open-\u00adended questions to elicit a n overview of the patient's story, you can then ask specific or closed questions to better characterize the symptoms, probe the details and f acilita te hypothesis testing. For exa mple, if the patient feels ill and has been c oughing, you might be considering respiratory infections. It would be important to ask specif ic questions such as, \"Have you had any f ever?\" or \"Are you bringing up any sputum?\" Use an o pen to closed question strategy Experienced clinicians weave o pen and closed quest ions througho ut the discussion o f the HPI. (15 ) They may explore physical sensations or events with general, open questions for as long as it takes to understand an overview of the patient's story. They use focused, open questions to explore a particular symptom and to form some hypotheses about disea se processes. They then ask, \"anything else?\" repeatedly, to give the patient a chance to mention other associated symptoms and concerns, until the patient says something like, \"no, that's all.\" They then transition to closed questions to elicit specific details in order to test hypotheses and to see if the patient's symptoms are consistent with a particular disease or syndrome.(16 ) Check o ut the video example about \"open to closed question strategy\" on the left. During the interview they may realize a point or discover a symptom tha t requires f urther clarification, or challenges their hypotheses, a nd explore this with open questions until they understand more, then switch to specif ic questions to clarify further. This process proceeds from open to closed to open to closed questi ons until all major symptoms have been explored, one or more hypotheses generated, and supporting or negating evidence elicited. Thus, they weave information into a constructed tapestry that blends the threads of the patient's story with the clinician' s thought processes and clinica l reasoning. Develo p the timeline o f the illness Ask patients to tell you the story of their illnesses from the beginning, and fa cilitate their story telling until you understand how an illness progressed from the onset until the present. Every sto ry has a beginning, a middle, and an end. Eliciting an a ccurate chronology helps patients organize their stories of illness, and often gives clues to underlying disease processes and contributing psychos ocial factors. Check o ut the video example about \"developing the timeline\" on the left. When does this patient's story truly begin? Try asking the patient these questions: Beginning questions:\"Go back to the beginning. What was the very first thing you noticed tha t felt unusual or diff erent?\" \"When did you last f eel well?\" Middle questions:\"How did your symptoms change over time?\" \"What happened next?\" End questions:\"Have you experienced anything similar in the past?\" \"What f inally prompted your seeking attention now?\" How did the story evolve over time? How does the story end in the pa tient's current condition? Trace the chronologica l unfolding of the story over time by asking: \"Wha t happened next?... and then what happened?\" until you have elicited a nd heard a blow-\u00adby-\u00adblow description. The key skill in develo ping th e timeline is asking \"what happened next?\" Characterize sympto ms Learn to ask for all the details about key symptoms in the patient's story. Severa l important aspects of symptoms must be characterized in order to generate hypotheses about their cause and treatment. General and specific co ntext of sympto ms Story timeline -\u00ad see above chapter \"D evelop the timeline of the illness\" Qualit y of sympto ms Aggravating and relieving facto rs Location and radiatio n of pain if present Severity Frequency o r quant ity, and duratio n (with exa mple video) Asso ciated sympt oms (with example video)Impact and meaning of sympt oms to the patient The general and specific co ntext of the sympto ms The general context of symptoms is the background within which the HPI occurs a nd develops. Who is this patient? What is going on in his or her life at the time the story begins and evolves? What are the psychosocial and physica l factors that may be playing a role in the pa tient's illness? Alan R's chest pain: Alan R. is a 52 year old accountant who ca me to the emergency department in early April for evaluation of chest pain. The morning of this episode, the patient learned tha t his sister-\u00adin-\u00adlaw, who had been battling metastatic breast cancer, had died leaving behind his brother and their two teenage children. Mr. R. had been under a good deal of stress at work, working long hours as it was approaching the income tax deadline for his clients. The sp ecific context contains the details of what is happening in the pa tient's life and immediate surroundings at the time of acute onset of symptoms. Alan R's chest pain (co nt.): The patient drove to his brother's home and parked at the bottom of a hill. As he dashed up the hill, he began thinking about the grief a nd distress he would soon encounter. He noticed the sudden onset of discomfort beneath his breastbone which increased in intensity as he approached his brother's apartment house. -\u00ad top -\u00ad Qualit y of sympto ms Try to imagine what the patient's symptoms might feel like. Ask about their quality a s if you were going to write a short story a bout the symptoms. The most important aspect of a patient's physical symptoms is its quality. What exactly is the patient trying to describe to you? As you progress through training, you develop an expanding databank of experience regarding how various diseases present. A patient' s description of various symptoms then triggers associations with specific disease entities, and guides hypothesis generation, which in turn directs further inquiry. Students a nd clinicians in training might try a strategy for understanding clinical symptoms that I call the use of \"somatic imagination.\" Try to imagine what the patient's physica l symptoms might feel like as if experiencing them yourself. If you can't imagine experiencing the symptoms yourself well enough to describe them clearly to a friend, ask more questions. Don't offer patients descriptive adjectives before eliciting theirs. Ask patients to describe the quality of their symptoms until they have exha usted their descriptive vocabulary. It is important to really listen to the words patients use to describe their symptoms, and use those words when reflecting back to the patient. If the patient speaks of \"a pressure,\" do not then say something like, \"so did this pain ra diate a nywhere?\" -\u00ad top -\u00ad Aggravating o r relieving facto rs Inquire, \"What makes the symptom better, (or worse).\" Ask patients what makes their symptoms better (palliation) and worse (provocation). Ask if there were any triggers that initiated the symptoms. Triggers and aggravating and relieving factors will give diagnostic clues. Af ter asking in an open-\u00adended way, you should ask questions that relate to your differential d iagnoses: Did cold air trigger the patient's wheezing and shortness of breath? Was there any relationship between the time the patient began taking anti-\u00adinf lammatory medicines and his epigastric pain? What happened to the patient' s calf pain when he stopped to rest? The answers to ma ny of these questions yield importa nt clues about diagnoses. -\u00ad top -\u00ad Location and radiatio n Find out exactly where the symptom is, and where it goes. If the symptoms are loca lized to a particular area of the body, ask patients to indicate exactly where they are experiencing them. Genera lized or systemic symptoms such as fatigue and malaise cannot be localized, but can be characterized using the other descriptors indicated. Some symptoms have chara cteristic patterns of radia tion or representation in a reas of the body other than their site of origin, such as the left arm a nd jaw discomfort associated with chest discomfort from coronary ischemia, or posterior leg pain from sciatic nerve impingement. Alan R's chest pain (co nt.): Mr. R had dif ficulty finding words for the sensation he had experienced as he was dashing up the stairs to his brother's a partment. It wa sn't painful exactly, but rather a sense of an increasingly oppressive, diffuse sense of substernal and left sided chest pressure, \"a s if a great weight had been placed there and was squeezing the breath out\" of him. He had no discomfort elsewhere. -\u00ad top -\u00ad Severit y Ask about the severity of the symptom. Characterizing the severity of symptoms helps the clinician understand their cause, significance, and the urgency with which they must be attended. The \"crushing\" substernal chest pain of myocardial inf arction, or \"thunderclap\" headache of subarachnoid hemorrhage are classical descriptions of problems requiring urgent attention. Many clinicians ask patients to rate pain symptoms on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the most severe. This is helpful to follow the progress of symptoms and eff icacy of therapy. -\u00ad top -\u00ad Frequency o r quant ity, and duratio n Ask patients how often they experience the symptoms, a nd how long they last. Quantifica tion of the number of episodes of a given symptom within a specified time period is also important, such as number of diarrheal stools per day, or number of episodes of chest pain weekly. Progression of physiologic and functional impairment can be tracked over time by quantifying symptoms such as number of blocks the patient is able to walk before the leg pain of peripheral vascular disease (claudication) sets in; or number of stairs the patient with congestive heart f ailure is able to climb before stopping to catch her breath. The duration of symptoms also provides clues about diagnosis and severity. An anginal episode seldom lasts longer than a few minutes, so it's less likely to be angina if a patient sa ys the chest pain lasted \"all da y.\" Or, a major depressive episode may be diagnosed if depressed mood persists along with other f eatures f or a 2-\u00adweek period or more.Check o ut the video example about \"characterizing symptoms \" on the left. -\u00ad top -\u00ad Asso ciated sympt oms Be diligent in discovering associated symptoms to help you test hypotheses. Once you understa nd the quality and evolution of the patient's symptoms over time, you begin to generate some preliminary hypotheses about their etiology. Your knowledge of the presentation of the diseases in your differential will guide your questioning about associated symptoms. This will help you to ei ther support or set aside a particular hypothesis. For example, in the case of Alan R, you would ask if he experienced any na usea or sweating, since these symptoms are associated with myocardial infarction. You would also ask symptoms associated with panic disorder, and might ask a bout symptoms associated with reflux esophagitis, costochondritis, a nd other diagnoses that can ca use chest pain. Check o ut the video example about \"exploring a ssociated symptoms\" on the left. -\u00ad top -\u00ad The impact of sympto ms Find out about dysfunctions, disabilities and adaptations the patient ma kes because of the symptoms. You should ask, \"how have these symptoms af fected you?\" If the patient is having acute symptoms, what functional a nd psychological effect are they having? Did the patient fall over, double up in pa in, have to sit or lie down, go the emergency room, call f amily members? Was th e patient frightened, puzzled, concerned, terrif ied? If the symptoms a re subacute or chronic, why is the patient coming to see you now? The patient' s answer to this question often uncovers hidden anxieties or new interpretations about the meaning of previously tolerated symptoms. If the symptoms are chronic, what a daptations has the patient had to make? What is the functional impa ct of illness on da ily activities? Can the patient dress, feed, bathe, go to the toilet, transfer f rom bed to chair, from chair to standing, pivot, walk independently, drive, shop, handlefinances, do errands such a s purchasing medications? What equipment is necessary at home? What losses has the patient suffered because of illness? Has the patient had to grieve or adjust to the loss of a vocation, a job, support networks a nd friends because of functional impa irment or disability? How has the illness affected others important to the pa tient? Alan R's chest pain (co nt.): When he reached the top of the stairs, Mr. R. stopped to catch his breath and ra ng the bell to the apartment. His brother opened the door. His other siblings and his mother ha d already arrived. The children had not yet returned home from school. He was relieved that his brother seemed calm and tha t the family wa s on hand to lend support. He sat down to rest. His chest pain gradually began to subside and was gone within 20 minutes. In retrospect, he vaguely recalled an episode of chest discomfort a few weeks prior af ter an argument with his boss. It had not been as severe and had lasted only a few minutes. He had ascribed it to \"indigestion\" at the time. He described his symptoms to his family who called an a mbulance to bring him to the Emergency D epartment f or eva luation. Much of the HPI and sympto m charact erization can best be elicited with these questio ns: Sympt om Characterizat ionQuestio ns Context of symptoms\"What was going on in your life when this began?\" \"How did this all start?\" Illness timeline\"Can you start at the beginning a nd tell me how this unfolded?\" \"When were you last feeling well?\" \"What happened next?\" Quality of symptoms\"What did that f eel like to you?\" Aggra vating, relieving factors\"What makes it better or worse?\" Location, radiation\"Exactly where do you f eel it? \" \"Does it go anywhere else?\" Severity\"Can you ra te the severity on a 1 to 10 scale, with 10 being the worst you can imagine?\" Duration \"How long does it last?\" Frequency \"How often does it occur?\" Associatedsymptoms\"Can you describe any other physical sensations you had when this all began?\" \"What else were you feeling?\" \"D id you notice any...(based on hypotheses).\" Impact ofsymptoms\"What did you do when y ou experienced these symptoms?\" \"How have you adapted to this illness?\" \"What was it that made you decide to come in today?\" -\u00ad top -\u00ad Listen actively Practice \"list ening o multiple levels;\" (17) use verbal and nonverbal encouragements, anduse silence f or its f acilita tive and therapeutic eff ects. Active listening is an acquired skill that involves \"listening on multiple levels,\" (18) the active use of verbal and nonverbal encouragements to speak, and the fa cilitative and therapeutic use of silence. Clinicians learn to \"listen on multiple levels.\" We listen to the gestalt and the details of the patient's story a s well as its emotional and practical impact on the patient. We learn to listen to and interpret \"paralanguage,\" the pauses, pace, pitch and volume of patients' conversati ons. The rising pitch and volume of an anxious or angry patient tells us as much as their words. We can also learn to \"listen\" to ourselves and our internal rea ctions to patients. Our own reactions are often helpful mirrors of the patient's state of mind. Our persona l experience of helplessness or sadness while listening to a patient, for example, clues us into a possible diagnosis of depression. While we are listening and trying to understand and ima gine patients' experiences, we are formulating hypotheses about the pa tients, their diagnoses, their emotional states, and what we will need to do next. One of the challenges of clinical listening at multiple levels is retaining the ability to focus on the patient's experience, remaining \"present\" with the patient while balancing all of the other intellectual tasks of doctoring. This is a difficult and importa nt skill which requires continuous practice and prof essional commitment. Nonverbal a nd verbal encouragements of speech, such as head nods and \"uh hm\" are important ways to facilitate the patient' s expression. Another aspect of active listening is the intentional use of silence. This can be difficult, especially for students and residen ts. We are trained to problem solve, to take action, to intervene. Yet, there are times when sitting quietly with a patient, especia lly during emotionally dif ficult moments, communicates powerf ully that we are listening, that we can hear wha t they have to say, that we respect them, that they can go on with their stories. Your attentive and respectful silence can be a potent therapeutic intervention. Clarify meaning Clarify important words that may have different meanings for you and for your patients. Both open and closed questions can be used to clarify unclear words or statements. It's astonishing that one word can have so many meanings for different people. For example, the word \"dizzy\" is used by patients to describe many different sensations including a swirling feeling as if one just f lew off a merry-\u00adgo-\u00adround, a sensation associated with dimming or tunneling of vision just before blacking out, blurry vision, trouble concentrating, nervousness or anxiety, fa tigue, diff iculty with balance, and a host of other meanings. Each of these sensations has diff erent clinical implications. If you aren' t clear about what patients a re describing, ask them to clarify. Check o ut the video example about \"clarify meaning\" on the left. Examples o f clarificat ion: \"I'm not sure I understand exactly wha t happened. Can you go back to when you wereclimbing the stairs and...\" \"What do you mean by stressed? Can you tell me what has been stressf ul?\" \"The word 'dizzy' means different things to people. Wha t do you mean when you say, 'dizzy'?\" Summarize Summarize, to communicate your understanding of the patient's story, and to encoura ge your patient to cla rify and fill in a ny gaps. When you f eel you understand a patient's history of illness, you ca n tell the patient you would like to summarize and would like the patient to correct a ny inaccura cies or omissions. Summarizing out loud reveals the ga ps in your understanding. It's a good way to check on the spot f or internal consistency, flow and logic. Patients appreciate accura te summaries because it indicates good listening. It a lso gives the patient a chance to correct a ny misunderstandings and to expand the story if need be. Check o ut the video example about \"summarize\" on the left. Alan R's chest pain (co nt.): Doc: \"I' d like to summarize what I' ve heard you say so far. Tell me if I've left out anything.\" Alan R: \"Sure.\" Doc: \"You were rushing up a hill to your brother's home when you developed some pressure, like a weight on the left side of your chest, which made it difficult for you to catch your breath. This lasted a bout 20 minutes until you were a ble to sit and rest and then the symptoms subsided completely. In retrospect, you may have had something similar a few weeks ago during an argument with your boss. All of this occurred while you were really upset over the death of your sister-\u00adin-\u00adlaw and concerned for your brother, in addition to your stress at work.\" Alan R: \"Yes, that's right.\" Redirectio n and transit ions Respectfully guide the interview by redirecting the patient and by using tra nsitional statements. You can use verbal redirections and transitions as respectful bridges to biomedical or psychosocial issues. When you \"a nnounce\" your transitions, or explain your thought process to the patient, you take the pa tient along on the path of inquiry. The patient is more likely to feel respected and included as a partner rather than the subject of a clinician-\u00addriven agenda.Sometimes you will decide to make a transition in the conversation. You ma y wish to further explore a symptom, or to change topics because time is limited, or to interrupt your patient who is talking about a subject not directly related to the present situation, or to explore remaining important psychosocial topics. At times when you wish to respectfully redirect the conversation, it is helpful to expla in what you're doing and why. Examples o f redirectio n and transitio ns: \"I would like to hear more about this, but in order f or us to decide wha t to do next about your cough, I'll need to ask you a f ew more questions. O.k.?\" \"I'd like to move on now to ask you about your past medical history.\" COMMUNICATION SKILLS that enco urage patient part icipatio n Verbal dominance, a narrow biomedical f ocus, inte rruptions, and a barra ge of closed or leading questions tend to consolidate clinicia ns' control of medical interviews with the potential sequelae of incomplete data collection, inef ficiency, and lower patient and clinician satisfaction. (19-\u00ad27 ) Sharing control of talk-\u00adtime and discussion topics, avoiding interrupting the patient, and encouraging patient participation in discussions will improve data gathering and patient satisfaction. You a re also more likely to understand your patient better and f eel more satisfied with your interview. The initial minutes of interviews communicates to patients how you want the interview to go. If you sta rt interviews with open questions, really listen to your patients, and encourage them to tell their stories, you are conveying to them that you want them to f ully express themselves. If you interrupt patients ea rly on, and ask many closed questions, you are conveying to patients tha t you are the one in charge and expect brief a nswers. You a re then likely to continue a doctor-\u00adcentered interview, since this is what you set up. Share talk t ime Avoid verbal dominance and high conversational control. Adjust your conversa tion style so it remains personal, collabora tive and effective with distressed a nd suffering pa tients. Integrate bio -\u00adtechnical with psychoso cial and affect ive issues Help patients expand their story-\u00adtelling; open the windows of opportunity to f ully apprecia te the stories' complexity. Elicit and explo re clues Learn and practice the Elicit, Explore, Acknowledge and Respond tactic. Respo nd to impo rtant clues Practice and become adept at responding to clues and feelings in rea l time Share talk t ime: Avoid verbal do minance and high co nversat ional control Share ta lk time by using open questions, encouraging patients to speak, a voidinginterruptions, and listening attentively. Studies show that many clinicians f launt the usual social rules of conversa tion, like, \"Take turns and don't interrupt!\" in interactions with patients. Clinicians often speak more than patients and control the topics of conversation (20 ), rather than sharing the discussion by using communication strategies that are relationship-\u00adcentered, and by including topics important to the patient. Interruptio ns are o ne way in which a speaker gains co ntrol o ver co nversat ion. (21) Some interruptions are unavoidable, and some may be beneficial, a s when pa tients interrupt to offer new inf ormation, or clinicia ns interrupt to redirect a patient on a tangent. Use of interruptions must be tempered by respect, a sense of partnership, and awareness of their consequences. Asking a barrage of closed questions, using medical jargon, asking leading or negatively phrased questions (\"You don't have any chest pain, do you?\") crea te an atmosphere of high clinician control. This tends to diminish patients' willingness and ability to speak. Asking a string of questions often baffles patients. A common version of this is, \"Do you have a ny chest pain, palpita tions, or shortness of breath?\" If the patient replies no, the clinicia n doesn' t know f or sure if the response applies to one or all of these symptoms. Beginning students will often also adopt a high control style in their anxiety to elicit inf ormation from patients. However, it is important to remember that most patients will want to tell their stories, if you will let them. It is best for many reasons to let patients do a good deal of the talking. You can a ccomplish this using the open to closed cone stra tegy, including using \"continuers,\" such as \"anything \"ca n you tell me more?\" to facilitate patients' telling their stories. Integrate bio medical with psychoso cial issues Help patients expand their story-\u00adtelling. Open windows of opportunity to fully a ppreciate the complexity of patients' stories. When primary care clinicians fo cus narro wly o n bio medical to pics, t hey dampen patients' expressio n and th ere is minimal exchange o f psycho social info rmat ion. (19 ) In a study of over 100 primary care clinicia ns and over 500 or their patients, a narrowly biomedical, clinician-\u00addominated communication pattern was the most common pattern, and wa s associated with the lowest satisfaction ratings by both patients and clinicia ns. Patients apprecia te clinicians who integrate psychosocial with biomedical topics, share talk-\u00adtime and are less verbally domina nt. (34 ) In general, patients do n't dist inguish t he bio logical and emo tional compo nents of their sympt oms. Patients present with symptoms that comprise an illness, and we as their caregivers often then search for clues to underlying diseases. As we learned in earlier modules, though, patients' experiences of symptoms are affected by persona lity, pa st experiences, f ears, and expectations. Interviewers who f ocus on the medical details to elaborate a differential dia gnosis may unconsciously filter out patients' comments a bout their worries or the meaning of their symptoms, and then miss the \"windows of opportunity\" into the heart of the patient's hopes a nd fears. (22 ) All the available studies emphasize that patients' symptoms and outcomes improve, patients' psychological distress diminishes, a nd both clinicia ns and patients f eel more satisfied when clinicians ask about both psychosocial and biomedical problems and encourage patients to participate in these discussions. (23 ,24)Elicit and explo re clues Learn and practice the Elicit, Explore, Acknowledge a nd Respond tactic A strategy helping clinicians gather and integrate psychosocial with biomedical information during interviews is to use repeating cycles of: Elicit, Explore, and Acknowledge/ Respond. (25 ,26) 1. Elicit and listen actively for clues about psychosocial a nd emotional concerns. 2. Explore clues by anchoring questions and statements in what's just been said. 3. Acknowledge and respond to clues about topics important to the patient. A minority of distressed patients reveal their most signif icant psychosocial concerns during the opening segment of an interview. Most patients who disclose such concerns do so later in the medical encounter, and usually only in response to an explicit inquiry. (27) Just as you continue to construct the patient's history of symptoms a nd your hypotheses throughout an interview, continue to build an understanding of the patient's psychosocial issues and concerns throughout the interview. You will be more ef ficient if you check on patients' concerns throughout the interview than if you wait until the interview is closing. (28,29) Sample questio ns/st atements t o probe for psycho social and emo tional issues \"What other concerns do you have?\" \"Was there anything else you wanted to mention?\" \"You looked upset when you mentioned your f ather.\" \"Can you tell me what concerns you most about these symptoms?\" Patients seldom express psychosocial concerns directly. Rather, they embed \"clues\" about the rest of their lives, their worries, and their expectations as they tell a bout their symptoms. One study about these clues categorized the findings as follows: statements involving: projection or denial of feelings and concerns (\"I' m not really worried but my wif e keeps nagging at me to get this checked out.\"); vivid symptom descriptions (\"This pain is torturing me like an executioner! \"); attempts to expla in (\"I' ve been wondering if this rash is f rom something I a te.\"); loaded statements or questions (\"I hear this pill you've given me can ca use breast cancer.\"); and behaviora l clues (e.g. patients who go for multiple opinions, or don't follow through on treatment plans).(30 ) Many primary care clinicians and surgeons (31) do not regularly pursue these clues, and fail to acknowledge patients' feelings.(32 ) Visits with these missed opportunities are longer than visits in which clinicians were responsive, so exploring clues may a ctually enhance eff iciency in the interview. (25 ) Conversation that sounds logical to the clinician who is pursuing a particular differential diagnosis may sound to a patient like a non-\u00adsequitur, inattention to psychological or emotional content, and at worst, disrespect. Alan R, co ntinued: Example of a missed \"window of opportunity\": Mr. R: \"Tha t feeling in my chest reminded me of my f ather. He had a heart attack when he was 53...same age as me.\" Mr. R. looks away distracted. Doc B: \"Did you have a ny nausea with the verbal or nonverbal clues a bout emotions or concerns are dropped, the patient may mention them again, mention them with increasing emphasis and anxiety, or set them aside. (33 ) Anchoring statements in what' s just been said helps the clinician explore clues and ga ther additional inf ormation. Responding to the patient's clues about underlying concerns and emotions tells the patient you have heard her and strengthens your relationship. Example o f stepping through a \"w indow of opportunity.\" Mr. R: \"That feeling in my chest reminded me of my f ather. He had a heart attack when he was 53...same age as me.\" Doc B: \"Your father had a heart attack when he was 53? What happened?\" Mr. R: \"He died. That's when I took over helping my mother watch out for my brothers and sisters.\" Doc B: \"So your f ather died at your current age. That must be making this even more frightening for you.\"Mr. R: \"Yuh. It worries me.\" Doc B: \"I can certa inly see how it would (pause). Is there anything else you wanted to tell me about that?\" Mr. R: \"No, I just wa nt to know what' s happening with me.\" Doc B: \"Ok. Would it be ok if I asked you a f ew more questions?\" Mr. R: \"Sure.\" Respo nd to important clues Practice and become adept at responding to clues and feelings in rea l time. You may not be able to respond to every clue or expression of emotion. Smith suggests that statements a bout feelings (\"I'm f eeling sad.\"), nonverbal expression of emotion (sighing, unhappy f acial expression), a nd more vivid expressions of emotion (crying, laughter) are at the top of a hiera rchy of clue importance. (33 ) These expressions always warrant f urther explora tion and response. Similarly, if a patient keeps reintroducing a series of clues concerning a specific topic, they should be explored in more detail. Some experienced clinicians listen closely, encourage the patient to continue, and then respond to a group of clues with a single empathic response. One group ca lls this \"the lasso eff ect.\" (32) We discuss helpful responses to patients' emotions in Module 6: \"Build the Relationship\" AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) COMMON PITFALLS IN GATHERING INFORMATION Using seco ndary rat her than primary sources o f info rmatio n.

Using this approach encourages the patient's active participation and shares control of interview talk-\u00adtime and content. Develop and practice skills to help you explore patients' symptoms as well as their psychosocial context and patients' response to their meaning a nd impact. You will be more satisfied, and your patients' will have better outcomes BEHAVIORAL SKILLS CHECKLIST Organize the interview to use allotted time ef fectively. Allow patients to begin telling their stories without interruption. Use open-\u00adto-\u00adclosed question strategies, and weave open and closed questions throughout the interview. Use verbal & nonverbal continuers and silence to facilitate patient's active participation. For major symptoms, elicit timeline, context, quality, aggravating/relieving factors, location/radiation, quantity/severity, duration/f requency, associated symptoms, a nd their impact. Clarify patients' words or statements. Summarize and encourage pa tients to add or correct. Verbalize transitions to new topics and respectfully redirect conversations. Anchor questions and statements in what has just been said. Avoid negatively phrased or leading questions.Share ta lk time and avoid verbal dominance. Integra te biomedical, psychosocial and af fective discussion topics. Elicit, explore and respond to clues about symptoms, feelings, and concerns. REFERENCES 1. Lipkin M Jr., Putnam SM, Lazare A.

Lown, MD You grea tly improve your patients' outcomes when you jointly contstruct the story of the illness, weaving the patient's elaboration of the biomedical a nd psychosocial threads together with your own hypotheses. The primary goals of information gathering are to elicit biomedical and psychosocial inf ormation in order to generate clinical hypotheses, and to understand the context and impact of the patient's illness while continuing to build the patient-\u00addoctor relationship. Video is loading... The Patient's View Video is loading... The Do ctor's View Questio ns fo r Reflect ion: 1. How would you respond if a clinician asked you to describe yourself? Who are you? What and who is important to you? What life circumstances affect your everyday life, health and well being? 2. How would you expla in to a clinician what you value and how you make decisions? 3. Many patients' perspectives on illness mecha nisms - often called an \"explanatory model\"-\u00ad differ from the prevailing biomedical model. Have you enga ged in conversa tions with patients about their \"explanatory models\"? 4. Are you able to inquire non-\u00adjudgmentally about belief s and social context? 5. What shifts in your values or attitudes will you need to make in order to better understand patients' perspectives? Key Principles: 1. Understanding patients' explanatory models a nd responding to them improves medica l outcomes. 2. Many factors modify patients' perspectives, including gender, signif icant relationships, occupation, education, socioeconomic status, culture, literacy, spirituality/religion, sexual orientation, leisure activities and stressors. 3. Listening for clues about these fa ctors and asking directly about them helps clinicia ns \"see the world through patients' eyes.\" 4. Signif icant healthcare disparities are mediated in part by clinicians' conscious and subconscious stereotyping. 5. Self-\u00adawareness and ref lection upon how ones perspective, assumptions, and bia ses differ from patients' improves clinician-\u00adpatient relationships, communication, a nd care. Learning go als: At the co nclusion o f this mo dule, yo u will be able to : Endeavor to more consistently apprecia te your patients' perspectives and to \"see the world through their eyes.\" Understand how patients' social contexts af fect their health and illness behaviors. Describe and demonstrate skills to elicit patients' social context, explanatory models, concerns and expectations. Explore personal assumptions a nd potential barriers to understanding patients' contexts and perspectives. UNDERSTAND PATIENTS' PERSPECTIVES Becoming aware of patients' perspectives and contexts can help clinicians understand why and how they are experiencing illness at this time. Showing interest in their perspectives builds rapport and encourages patients to disclose important information. Combinin g this behavior with explicit inquiry about each patient's unique context and situa tion improves medical outcomes. Recent trends in American medicine have widened the gap between patients' experiences of illness and their clinicians' perspectives. These include the ascendancy of biomedica l research with its panoply of new medications and technologies (1), economic pressures on clinicians to see more patients in limited amounts of time, a complex and inequitable healthcare system (3), and increasing diversity of patients in education, culture, language, literacy and socio-\u00adeconomic status (35). Attention to, and exploration of, pa tients' ideas about why they are sick and wha t should be done transforms the process of care. Patients who express their perspectives and thoughts to their clinicians have im proved clinical outcomes and are more satisfied (4-\u00ad7). Clinicians ca n develop skills to converse with patients a bout their perspectives. Often, the resulting dialogue results in more effective management plans and improved patient adherence to those plans. This module elaborates the contextual domains and skills needed to elicit, explore and comprehend patients' experiences from their points of view, and show how that process improves medical outcomes. Conflicts between explanato ry mo dels Many patients do not share their clinicia ns' biomedical \"explanatory model.\" Clinicians live a nd work in the culture of biomedicine and disease. B ut patients experience illness and suff ering, and clinicians may fa il to apprecia te the power of this dif ference. (22). Even when the patient and clinician are aligne d on many aspects of culture, fro example, on race, gender, religion, and socioeconomic status, the patient may explain and understand the experience of illness in wa ys profoundly different from the clinicia n's understanding of the disease process. Pneumo niaMs R., 38 years old and a concert f lute player, hospitalized with lower lobe pneumonia a nd bronchospasm, is on IV antibiotics, inhaled beta -\u00adagonist bronchodila tors, prednisone, and fluids. Her team was pleased that she was doing well and anticipated discharging her in a day or two. Ms. R. believed she got pneumonia because extensive travel had weakened her resistance. She wanted to know how to strengthen her body to prevent future episodes. She felt her hospital based clinicians focused solely on her acute symptoms. Her ca reer was blossoming and she had more travel scheduled in the near future. She remained upset and anxious and decided to see an acupuncturist to bolster her immune system when she returned home. Differences in meaning-\u00adma king cause misunderstandings, poor adherence to recommendations and poor clinical outcomes. Kleinman suggests using nonjudgmental questions to help clinicians understand patients' belief s about illness. (See questions, below, and (22). Clinicians who employ this type of inquiry will better apprecia te their patients' perspectives about illness and treatment. Kleinman's \"explanato ry mo del\" questio ns will help yo u elicit pat ients' beliefs, and initiate dialog t hat clarifies po tential culturally based tro uble spo ts: What do you think is causing your problem? Why do you think it started when it did? What do you think your sickness does to you? How does it work? How has it af fected you physically? Personally? How severe is your sickness? How long do you think it will last? What are the chief problems your sickness has caused for you? What concerns you most about your sickness? Bring co nnectio n and technical expertise Understanding the patient's perspective brings clinicians into connection and relationship, supplements the technical work, and transforms clinicians. Viewing an illness through a patient's lens transf orms patient relationships from a purely technical undertaking to a fully human and healing endeavor. As clinicians e xplore their patients' explanatory models in the face of illness and suff ering they sometimes become deeply connected, as illustra ted in this quotation f rom clinician and poet William Carlos Willia ms, M.D.: \"I lost myself in the very properties of [my patients'] minds, for the moment at least, I actually became them . . \"(38). Such unique and privileged moments are gifts tha t infuse clinicians' work w ith meaning and purpose, and allow suf fering patients to feel joined a nd less alone. Your gif ts of yourself , through f ull attention, caring and compassion, are neither less important nor more crucial than your technical expertise and competence. All are necessary, and each is insuff icient without the others. There are times when showing \"expertise\" is more highly valued than a \"compassiona te\" verbal st atement. For example, resea rch with the pa rents and clinicians of young leukemia patients shows evidence that technical expertise may be interpreted as compassionate ca re. \"Contra ry to current assumptions, parents' sense of emotional connection with doctors did not depend on doctors' emotional behavior, and pa rents did not feel disempowered by doctors' authority.\"(39) Superior patient care includes a ll of these elements because the information obtained and the process of obtaining it will help illumina te why and how the illness is active and which interventions are not only feasible but also compatible with the patient's lif e goa ls.Maintaining a balance between giving to patients and preserving ones-\u00adself , between expressing compassion and functioning technically in a steady and competent fashion is a central challenge of clinician work (Module 4). Empathic understanding transforms clinicians. Coulehan ca lls this ability \"emotional resilience.\" (11) AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) EXPLORING LIFE ISSUES TRANSFORMS CARE Clinicians often f ail to recognize contextua l factors and patients' lif e issues that strongl y impact their health status, often adversely. Important social context considera tions include the patient's roots and cultural identity, gender and sexual orientation, education, language and literacy, occupation, primary rela tionships and support network, religious or spiritual pra ctices, leisure a ctivities, stressors, mood, financial status as it perta ins to healthcare and daily needs to maintain he alth (12-\u00ad14). These contextual aspects comprise major elements of personal identity and significa ntly influence health status. Further, clinicians' understanding of these elements strongly a ffects patient relationships and clinicians' ability to effectively manage care. During inpatient rounds, a resident presented a 38-\u00adyear-\u00adold woman who was recovering from a severe bout of her frequently recurring a sthma. She had been critically ill and intubated during hospitalization three months previously. This time her recovery was rapid, and she was out of intensive care, ready to start oral medica tions. When I asked, \"Why does this woman keep getting sick?\" There was silence until one student ventured, \"She is a smoker -\u00ad-\u00ad that probably contributes.\" I sug gested that we should ask the patient f or her perspec tive. It was much more than cigarettes; with minimal encouragement she explained that her mother died suddenly two years ago. She felt tremendous guilt that she had not done enough f or her mother a nd resumed her crack addiction, after having been entirely clean f or a dozen years. She was now homeless, had no health insurance a nd couldn't af ford her medications. We rea lized that the team had focused on curing the acute asthma but had not understood her illness. To prevent future hospitalizations the patient needed drug rehabilitation, counseling, and social work intervention. As many as one third of primary care patients have life issues (excluding psychiatric diagnoses such as depression and anxiety) they identify a s adversely af fecting health at an of fice visit, yet clinicians' recognition of these factors varies widely (8 ). Elicit the patient's so cial co ntext Contextual elements of patients' lives signif icantly influence their health status. Your understanding of these elements af fects your patient relationships and your ability to effectively manage care. Illust rative case discussio n Dr M. saw Ms. H., a 3rd year medical student, f or an illness tha t began six months ago with numbness and tingling in her left leg. The initia l symptoms resolved, and in this secondepisode, Ms H had numbness in her arms and hands and found it difficult to raise her right arm to brush her hair. D r M's exa m confirmed weakness as well as sensory deficits. He wa s concerned about a demyelina ting process such a s multiple sclerosis. Dr M and Ms H discussed this possibility as well a s her thoughts a nd fears. Dr M wanted to address Ms H's fatigue and the need for rest with her before she left the office. Dr. M: \"Let's do the MRI a nd then we'll get tog ether to talk about it...How' s it going in your clerkships?\" Ms. H: \"OK, I g uess. I'm pretty much exhausted all the time but I've liked the clerkships I've done so f ar - especia lly pediatrics.\" Dr. M: \"Tha t's great. That leads me to wonder if the demands of third year are going to be a bit too much for you right now. We ma y need to think about your taking some time off or slowing down your on-\u00adcall schedule until we know wha t's going o n and you're feeling better.\" Ms. H: \"I don't think I want to do that. It would be hard on the rest of the team and on me not to do what everyone else is doing. I'm o.k. for now.\" Dr. M: \"I can see how committed you are. I wonder if making some a djustments mig ht nevertheless be helpful?\" Discussion: Ms. H. hoped that D r. M. would reassure her that her symptoms were not serious, but she had already resear ched the various diseases that could cause them. How could she possibly reduce her schedule? Everyone else would have to pick up her load, plus she couldn't delay her graduation. Her f amily expected so much of her, both in terms of professional and financial success, and she had incurred a substantial debt. Ms. H. wa s the f irst person, let alone the first woman, in her family to go to college. Her parents were immigrants with few resources, had medical problems and spoke little English, and a younger sister was in trouble with drugs. She had to do well enough to get a good internship a nd then return home to help both her f amily and her community. If Dr. M. has Ms. H.'s well being in mind, but does not understand the complexity of her life context, how would his recommenda tion of a respite from her duties (to Ms. H. or to her Dean) be received and acted upon by Ms. H.? The remainder of this module highlights selected components of the patient's context and the major impact of differences in how patients' understand and explain illness. Other modules address in more detail the issues of cultural identity (Module 15), gender and sexual orientation (Module 18) and spirituality (Module 19). Many of these elements are contained in the \"Social History.\" (Module 5) We present evidence a bout the utility of this information and discuss the process of eliciting and understanding the patient's perspective. Socioecono mic inequality To be effective in explorations with patients, sustain a belief in the importance of inquiry about context, listen to answers non-\u00adjudgmentally, and prepa re to examine your assumptions about patients. We all carry preconceptions, often unconsciously. Discussion:Mr. G, 44, came to urgent care because of lightheadedness. He recently began work f or a construction company and was painting a building on a sunny day when he felt lightheaded. He managed to get off the scaffolding, rested, got up to get some water, but noticed his vision \"tunneling in\" as if he were about to pass out. Friends brought him water but he remained lightheaded, so he came in. Mr. G has had hypertension that was difficult to control on an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibit or, beta blocker, and diuretic. At the clinic, his sitting blood pressure was 100/60 and pulse 65, standing 80/60 a nd pulse 65. His physica l exam was otherwise unremarkable and EKG showed only sinus bradycardia. Doctor N thought that dehydration superimposed on Mr. G's antihypertensive regimen had caused the symptoms. He decided to a sk about Mr. G' s perspectives and life issues. Doctor N: \"So what do you think caused this problem?\" Mr. G: \"I hate to admit it, doc, but this is the f irst time I have had insurance f or years, and this is the first week I have taken all my medicines. B efore, I f illed one or another prescription whenever I could afford it. I suppose I should have told someone.\" Discussion: Socioeconomic status is a strong predictor of health status, and lower socioeconomic classes have sig nificantly higher mortality and poorer health. The report, \"Income, Poverty and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2003\" shows increa sing disparities in income and health. In 2010, 15.1 percent of all persons in the US lived in poverty, the highest poverty rate since 1993. In previous studies, people in the poorest households were 4-\u00ad5 times more likely to die in the next 10 yea rs than those in the richest (15).Marginalized social groups have little control over health-\u00adrelated societal resources (16). Lack of health insurance is directly associated with increased mortality, a dverse health outcomes, and increased likelihood of avoidable hospitalizations and emergency care (17). In 2010 an estimated 16.3% of people (about 49.9 million) were without health insurance.(2) Communicat ion abo ut insurance and mo ney Uninsured patients a re understandably reluctant to talk about lack of money and insurance. Patients may be unable to follow their clinician's advice due to financial a nd insurance problems. Patients seldom admit, usually because of embarrassment, that they didn't fill a prescription, or tried to stretch out the prescription by taking the medicine every other day. Communication research data show that patients are more willing to disclose this information if their clinician inquires in a non-\u00adjudgmental f ashion. Talk abo ut financial and insurance issues Normalize the issues by saying: \"Some patients have financial problems that ca n affect their health\" Elicit info rmat ion by asking quest ions such as: \"Have finances been a problem f or you?\" \"Have money problems prevented you f rom getting medical care? Medicines?\" HEALTHCARE COMMUNICATION AND CULTURE Clinicians may differ f rom patients in many culturally determined ways -\u00ad-\u00ad in a ddition to the \"culture of bio-\u00admedicine\" issues. S ome a re obvious, others subtle. Culture is \"the lens through which we give our world meaning.\" (18) It can be broadly def ined as \"an integrated pattern of learned belief s and behaviors that can be shared among groups a nd include thoughts, styles of communicating, ways of interacting, views of roles and relationships, values, practices, and customs.\" (19) Culture is a key aspect of patients' social context. We are all immersed in multiple cultures by virtue of characteristics such as age, gender, sexual orienta tion, race/ethnicity, professional training, socioeconomic status, and religion, to name a few. In f act, each patient-\u00adclinician encounter is a cross-\u00adcultural enco unter between multiple unique life-\u00adworld differences, including the culture of biomedicine. Clinicians' cultural competency signif icantly affects their ability to understand patients' perspectives. Core cultural issues include how patients regard individual autonomy vs. group a uthority when making decisions about healthcare; mistrust of clinicians and the healthcare system based on prior experiences of discrimination; non-\u00adverbal styles of communica tion such as eye contact and personal space; perceptions of the role of the clinicia n and ef ficacy of biomedicine; the role of cultural traditions and customs; and gender or sexua l-\u00adorientation based roles and expectations within cultures. In a given conversation it is often dif ficult to discern whether a specific cultural difference, whether subtle or obvious, influences communica tion, diagnosis and treatment. The challenge is to understand which cultural processes or issues are salient to a particular patient at any given time. Clinicia ns should f amiliarize themselves with communication pa tterns, health habits, specia l religious or ethnic belief s and prevalent diseases in the various cultures a nd communities in which they practice. This is always an imperf ect process, however, and application of any generalized assumption may resuls in poor care. (examples: \"Older people dislike revea ling themselves to younger doctors;\" or \"men care less about emotions than women,\") Cultural Co mpet ence Culturally competent clinicians hold the assumption that neither their own cultural perspective, nor their patients' cultural views are \"superior;\" nor is the cul ture of medicine the only way to understand illness Cultural competency or \"cross-\u00adcultural ef ficacy,\" (19) is the ability to hold the assumption that while different, neither yours nor the other person's culture is superior. Milton Bennett describes a continuum in the development of intercultura l sensitivity. People typically progress f rom ethnocentric stages of denial, defense or minimization of difference to the ethno-\u00adrelative stages of acceptance, adaptation a nd integration of diff erence.(21) The shift into ethno-\u00adrelativism as defined by B ennett is mediated by empathy (Module 5, 6, 13), or the ability to temporarily shift one's f rame of reference to see the world \"as if\" through the eyes of another person. In this module, we highlight some core cultural inquiry skills; Module 16 goes into mor e detail about understanding a nd negotiating cultural dif ferences in medical settings. Core cultural issues include the following: Autonomy: how patients regard individual autonomy vs. group a uthority when making decisions about healthcare; Trust : mistrust of clinicians and the healthcare system based on prior experiences of discrimination; Habit s: non-\u00adverbal styles of communica tion such as eye contact and personal space; Roles: perceptions of the role of the clinician and eff icacy of biomedicine; Traditio ns: the role of cultural traditions and customs;Gender expect ations: gender or sexua l-\u00adorientation based roles and expectations within cultures. Inquire about core cultural issues Would you like me to include family or anyone else as we talk? Would you prefer to see a man or woman clinician? What kinds of experiences have you had with doctors or in getting the care you need? Biomedical culture Be prepared to communicate with patients about diff erences between their perspective on an illness process and a biomedical \"explanatory model.\" Clinicians think in terms of pathology and the pathophysiology of disease. However, patients' experience illness, pain and suff ering, not \"pathology.\" The magnitude of this dif ference in perspective va ries dramatically f rom one situation to another. For example, a person with lung cancer may share the clinician' s biomedica l perspective, while the same patient with a heada che or depression may not. Furthermore, many problems do not fit any single, simple model; alcoholism and domestic violence are examples. Exploration of the differences in perspective r esults in better communication and improvements in care. Some time ago Kleinman suggested nonjudgmental questions to help clinicia ns understand patients' beliefs a bout illness. The questions are still entirely relevant to clinical care, and clinicia ns who employ this type of inquiry will better apprecia te their patients' perspectives about illness and treatment. (22) Kleinman's \"explanato ry mo del\" quest ions will help yo u elicit pat ients' beliefs, and initiate dialog t hat clarifies po tential culturally based tro uble spo ts: What do you think is causing your problem? Why do you think it started when it did? What do you think your sickness does to you? How does it work? How has it af fected you physically? Personally? How severe is your sickness? How long do you think it will last? What are the chief problems your sickness has ca used for you? What concerns you most about your sickness? Self-\u00adt reatment Many of your patients will try home remedies, complementary or alternative therapies. Most patients take some action to relieve symptoms. Many patients use healing practices specific to a culture with which they identify. Sixty seven percent of U.S. respondents used at least one complementary and alternative therapy in their lifetime. (23) Th e extensive use of folk healing practices and complementary therapies (24) suggests that clinicians will often receive useful data in response to a question such as, \"Do you see other therapists or healers for advice about your health?\"Elicit informat ion abo ut self-\u00adtreatment behavio rs: What treatments have you tried so far? Have you tried any over-\u00adthe-\u00adcounter, alternative, or home remedies? Have you seen any providers besides me about this? What kinds of treatments do you think would be most helpful? What are the most important results you hope to receive from this treatment? Language Language barriers contribute to suboptimal health outcomes. Language barriers play a part in suboptimal healthcare and outcomes. In the U.S. popula tion over 5 years old, 17.9% speak a language other than English a t home. Over 21 million people speak English \"less than very well.\" (25) Patients who speak English as a second language may appear to be fluent since they speak well, but may not understand all that you say, and be embarrassed to admit this. When explaining medical care issues to these patients, it is often helpf ul to ask them to explain to you their understa nding of what you have communicated, \"to make sure that I have explained it to you clearly enough.\" Elicit informat ion abo ut language: What language do you speak at home? Literacy Low literacy is a barrier to adequate health care, and it predicts worse health outcomes, despite higher healthcare utilization. Health literacy is defined a s \"the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate hea lth decisions.(26 )\" The National Adult Literacy Survey showed tha t nearly 50% of adults have difficulty understanding a nd acting on health information. Health-\u00adrela ted materials are seldom written at the level of patients' reading and comprehension skills.In one large survey, 42% of patients could not understand directions f or taking medicine on an empty stomach and 26% did not understand information about their next s cheduled appointment. Patients with low literacy have worse health outcomes and greater risk of hospital admission (28). A 2011 review confirms the inverse relationship of outcomes to literacy(39). Among patients with heart f ailure in an integrated managed care organization, low health literacy was signif icantly associated with higher a ll-\u00adcause mortality. (40) Low literacy correlates with mortality, lower adherence to anticoagulation therapy, poor diabetic control, and higher health care utilization and costs. Genera lly, people are ashamed or embarrassed about reading and comprehension problems, and are more likely to respond to invitations offered gently and in a non-\u00adjudgmental fa shion. Recommendations f or uncovering this problem in a nonjudgmental f ashion are shown below. Normalize the issue by saying: Some of my patients have trouble reading. Is this a problem f or you?Elicit informat ion abo ut lit eracy: How happy are you with the way you read? Does anyone at home help you read or follow medical instructions? What would help you learn more about this problem? What would help you take this medicine properly? Stereotypes Clinicians, like other members of society, may apply conscious and unconscious stereotypes to patients that that result in poor communication and poor care. Studies indica te that clinically meaningful dispa rities in healthcare persist even af ter adjustment for socioeconomic fa ctors. Research substantiates the presence of socially conditioned and usually unconscious prejudicial a ttitudes among providers (20), whose perceptions are af fected by patient ethnicity, race, socioeconomic status and other factors. People match individua ls to various social categories, which spares the use of cognitive resources, but can lead to the use of stereotypes through which attitudes a nd beliefs about a group of people are unconsciously applied to an indivi dual thought to be a member of the group. Some evidence suggests that time pressure, the need to make rapid judgments, task complexity and cognitive load increase the likelihood of applying stereotypes. Many f actors contribute to the application of stereotypes (30), including cultural and individua l differences, language barriers or differences in communica tion style in the description of symptoms. An other factor, particularly in the presence of clinica l uncertainty, may be clinician use of categorization strategies to simplify the cognitive processing of complex information (31). Mr. S., a 32 year old man with sickle cell trait, was hospitalized for the third time in the past 6 months, this time f or a hot swollen knee. The orthopedics consultant tapped the synovial fluid, found no evidence of infection, and suggested that the patient had an anserine bursitis. On teaching rounds, the intern presented Mr. S's history and indicated suspicion about Mr. S's compla ints of severe pain. The attending clinician demonstrated a moderate knee joint effusion, limited range of motion and no tenderness over the anserine bursa. After the team left the bedside, the attending asked how the physica l findings a ffected their dif ferential diagnosis. A resident stated that regardless of diagnosis, the patient was \"a drug-\u00adseeker.\" Therefore his complaint of pain wa s unreliable and should not affect plans for treatment or disposition Injustice, inequity and disparit ies Assumptions and stereotypes superimposed on a national history of racial discrimination contributes to healthcare disparities a nd distrust of the healthca re system a nd clinicians by many patients. Clinicians ha ve a specia l responsibility to address this societal problem. Stereotyping leads to bias and disparities in care (29). The assumptions clinicians and patients make confound appropriate health care. Over 700 clinicia ns who viewed videotapes of actors portraying patients with the same story of chest pain referred women and bla cks signif icantly less often for cardiac catheterization than men and whites. (37) When clinicians believe that patients won't adhere to treatments, they are less likely to ma ke recommendations. Furthermore, a legacy of racial discrimination and mistrust of health professionals, especia lly within the African Americanpopula tion, discoura ge some patients f rom seeking care or f ollowing up on it (20). Every clinician has a social responsibility to recognize and minimize healthcare disparities, and to promote social justice within the health care system (34). D iversity training and studies demonstrate that \"perspective-\u00adtaking,\" especially when focused on imagining a particular group member's feelings, can arouse f eelings of empa thic concern and reduce prejudice a nd stereotyping (35). Every clinician has a personal a nd professional responsibility to know their patients as individua l persons rather tha n as a conglomerate of stereotypes, socia l categories, or unexamined biases, and to strive to understand their patients' perspectives on healthcare matters.

INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW The introduction section of this module is outlined as f ollows: How much informatio n sho uld clinicians share with pat ients? Relationship-\u00adcentered information sharing improves outcomes. However, patients' desires for information are often not met in clinical practice. What are t he go als o f sharing informatio n?To further empower patients, we teach ma ny patients self-\u00admanagement skills tha t are based on two assumptions. Will patients ret ain informatio n? People are most motivated to learn when they identify a need or a problem. Patients are o ften afraid to ask quest ions. Embarrassment or worry impedes patients from asking f or additional information. Knowledge, science, uncert ainty and informatio n-\u00adgiving Say \"I don't know\" when you don't, and modulate your information giving when the information is emotiona lly charged. How much informatio n sho uld clinicians share with patients? The word D octor derives f rom La tin, \"docere\" which means \"to teach.\" Relationship-\u00adcentered information sharing improves outcomes. However, patients' desires for information are often not met in clinical practice. The burgeoning number of websites on health topics attests that patients wa nt information about their bodies and their health. In particular, patients wa nt their clinicians to provide health-\u00adrelated information.(1 ) Studies indicate that patients' psychological distress improves, symptoms resolve, and clinical outcomes (eg, blood pressure control) improve when clinicians supply clear information with emotional support.(2-\u00ad5 ) When clinicia ns supplement their inf ormation with printed materials, patients' mood, a nxiety and function improve and pain decreases.(6-\u00ad8 ) Effective patient educa tion improves adherence to pla ns,(9) and patient education programs that include self-\u00admanagement strategies result in reduced healthcare utilization, less lost work time and improvement in symptoms.(10 ) Clinicians overestimate the time they spend educa ting patients and under-\u00adestimate how much information their patients want.(11-\u00ad13 ) A large nationwide survey noted that 10% of discharged patients reported not receiving information they wanted, and 25% felt they didn't receive enough information about how much pain and discomfort to expect during procedures or post-\u00adoperatively. One third of patients said their doctors and nurses didn't answer their questions understandably, and up to 45% of patients said they weren't told wha t danger signs to watch for after discharge. (14) What are t he go als o f sharing informatio n? To further empower patients, we teach many patients self-\u00admanagement skills tha t are based on two assumptions. The first is that if patients and clinicians colla borate as partners, they can define goals and strategies better than either could do alone.(15 ) The second is the reality that patients with chronic diseases already make daily management decisions. The essential goal of sharing inf ormation is to empower patients to optimize their health. Traditional patient educa tion teaches patients how their bodies function in health and in specific disease states, and how to maintain health and prevent illness. When patients have symptoms or are ill, we s hare information about diagnosis and dia gnostic testing plans, including risks, benef its, alternatives, and results. We help patients understand about prognosis, what to expect; and the components of trea tment plans and the rationale f or them. Clinicians and other healthcareprofessiona ls teach technica l and home monitoring skills that allow patients to manage chronic illnesses eff ectively. Self-\u00admanagement education emphasizes self -\u00addirected goa l setting and behaviora l regulation.(16 ) It teaches patients self-\u00admonitoring techniques (such a s keeping symptom diaries, blood sugar, blood pressure, or peak f low measurements) and encourages patients to keep records of whether prescribed interventions aff ect their symptoms (such as taking nitroglycerin before anticipated exertion). Patients learn how to adjust their medications a ccording to a written action plan tailored to their needs and disease severity.(17 ) They ca n apply problem-\u00adsolving skills to medical issues as well as social and emotional problems that arise when coping with chronic illness.(18,19 ) Clinicians who help pa tients link with community resources enhance the eff ectiveness of this approa ch to patient education.(20 ) For patients with chronic diseases, traditiona l patient educa tion compares poorly to self-\u00ad management educa tion. For example, progra ms tha t focus on asthma knowledge do not decrease hospitalization ra tes, doctors' visits f or asthma attacks, time lost from school or work, medication usage, or improve lung function.(21 ) In contrast, establishing collaborative relationships results in fewer symptoms, cost benef its from f ewer hospitalizations and emergency visits, improved lung function a nd better quality of life.(22 ) Arthritis self -\u00admanagement education produces similar outcomes and cost reductions.(23 ) Will patients retain info rmatio n? People are most motivated to learn when they identify a need or a problem. Use explora tion of current knowledge, repetition, checking feelings and checking understanding to maximize retention. Adult learning theory transf ormed our approach from the notion of passive information transfer to the facilitation of active, collaborative, self-\u00addirected learning.(24 ) Most adults prefer to be self-\u00ad directed, and are motiva ted to learn when lif e experience introduces a need, a problem or an interest. For information you wish to convey, exploring patients' existing knowledge about a particular issue a nd building upon their knowledge, past experiences and current needs helps you facilitate their learning.(25 ) Other specific teaching strategies are associated with good patient recall. These include simplification, repetition, specif icity, reinf orcement, exploring patients' ideas and information, a nd checking the patient's understanding.(26 ) (see module 9) Patients are o ften afraid to ask quest ions Embarrassment or worry impedes patients from asking f or additional information. Anticipate this or use gentle prompts to help reluctant patients disclose concerns and ask questions. Patients wa nt information, but may not ask key questions because they are afraid of the answer; such as in, \"Am I going to die?\" \"How long do I have to live?\" \" What if I don't wake up from anesthesia ?\" or because of emba rrassment or a sense of sha me; such as, \"Will this affect my sex life?\" \"Did I do anything to make this happen?\" Patients may be embarrassed about not knowing how their bodies work, not doing what is good for them- and do not want to appear ignorant or negligent. Often you ma y anticipate that patients will f ear asking certain questions, and c an address the issues directly, \"Many patients worry about resuming sex after they have had a heart attack. Is that a concern of yours?\" Patients frequently wa it to ask the embarrassing questions until the end of the encounter. They will only a sk them if they trust that you will be non-\u00ad judgmenta l and perceive you have the time. S tating up front that you have the time, and want to answer all their concerns, and continuing to ask, \"Are there other concerns?\" will often bring outthe deepest or more embarrassing concerns. You could also a sk gently, \"Is there anything you've been afraid to a sk me?\" Knowledge, science, uncert ainty and info rmat ion-\u00ad giving Say \"I don't know\" when you don't, and modulate your information giving when the information is emotiona lly charged. Medicine is a profession based upon knowledge and science, as well as uncertainty. Patients know that new science emerges daily, that today's truth may be proven wrong by tomorrow's evidence and tha t no clin ician can keep up with every new development. They a ppreciate that acknowledging uncertainty is a sign of clinical maturity rather than academic weakness; as long as you demonstra te that you care enough about them personally to seek relevant inf ormation on their beha lf. It's important to say, \"I don't know\" when you don't, to seek the information you need, and to bring your f indings back to the patien t. When your information giving is emotiona lly charged you should also clarify with your of fice staff or hospital team who is the most appropriate person to share information with a given patient. In advance, determine how much content will be shared, especially when discussing test results, prognosis, or communicating bad news. Giving premature advice, tentative plans or reassurance to patients and fa milies before obtaining and clarifying all of the relevant information is counter-\u00ad productive and can be harmf ul. LEARN THE FUNDAMENTAL STRATEGY FOR SHARING INFORMATION: ASK-\u00adTELL-\u00adASK When clinicians share information they predominantly TELL information, often in too much detail, and in terms tha t sometimes alarm patients. Information sharing is most ef fective when clinicians remain sensitive to the emot ional impact of their words. By using a strategy of ask-\u00adtell-\u00adask, you will greatly enhance patients' understanding and promote adherence to plans. Adult learning theory and self-\u00admanagement educa tion stra tegies inform us how to communicate most eff ectively and teach information to patients. The fundamental points are that we need to stay in dialogue (not monologue), begin with a n assessment of the patie nt's needs, tell small chunks of inf ormation tailored to those needs, and check on the patient's understanding, emotional reactions and concerns. This is summarized by the three step format, \"Ask-\u00adTell-\u00adAsk.\" Each step includes several discrete issues. A simple skill, namely, alternating between telling sma ll amounts of inf ormation, then checking for understanding a nd asking your patients about its effect on them, will help you ef fectively modulate the amount and type of information tha t you share and eff iciently communicate what your patients need most. What t o ask and tell ASK to assess patient emotional state and the patient's desire for information. TELL small amounts of information in simple langua ge, and ASK about the pa tient's understanding, emotional reactions a nd concerns. Many conversations between clinicians and pa tients sound like, \"Tell-\u00adTell-\u00adTell,\" a nd some people call this monologue \"doctor babble,\" because clinicians seem to be talking to themselves, rather than having a dialog or conversation with patients. Remember to use the Ask-\u00adTell-\u00adAsk f ormat so that you remain in dia logue with your patients. Here is a list of the ASK's a nd TELL's that covers important areas for sharing. Click on the hyperlinks to go directly to the section indica ted. ASK to assess pat ient needs Make sure the setting is conducive. Assess the patient's physical and emotional state. Assess the patient's informational needs Assess the patient's knowledge and understanding. Assess the patient's attitudes and motiva tion Assess the patient's level of literacy. TELL info rmatio n abo ut diagno sis, treat ment or other aspects o f the situat ion Keep it brief Use a systematic approa ch Build on the patient's prior experience Personalize information Use simple langua ge, avoid jargon Choose words that do not unnecessarily a larm Use visual aids Offer supplemental ma terials ASK abo ut the patient 's understanding, emo tional react ions and concerns Assess the patient's understanding Elicit and respond to the patient's emotions Elicit additional concerns and/or questions ASK to assess pat ient needs The ASK sectio n consist o f the following it ems: Assure privacy, check wit h the patient that setting is co nducive Patients cannot properly receive a nd react to information if the setting is disruptive or public. ASK: Assess the patient 's physical and emot ional state If patients express emotional distress, acknowledge, explore and respond to their feelings at the moment of their expression. ASK: Assess the patient 's informatio nal needs Elicit the patient's questions and concerns up f ront, asking \"anything else?\" until the patient acknowledges that all concerns have been expressed. ASK: Assess the patient 's knowledge and underst andingBuilding on ba seline knowledge-\u00adtargeting your information-\u00adis ef ficient and respectful, and more likely to transfer the new information than if you start with wha tever you assume is most important. ASK: Assess the patient 's attitudes and mot ivation Patients will not be interested in hearing your health information if they are not motivated, or if they have negative attitudes a bout the outcomes of their efforts, so ask about this directly. ASK: Determine t he patient's level o f literacy Low literacy is common a nd seriously limits understa nding. Ask simple questions that check literacy, and learn resources that you can make availa ble to patients. ASK: Assure privacy, check with the patient that setting is co nducive Patients cannot properly receive and rea ct to information if the setting is disruptive or public. Clinicians should not share sensitive information in public places. Conside r the setting before sharing inf ormation. D o all you can to ensure that the setting is conducive to a comfortable a nd honest inf ormation exchange. Sharing information in a hallway, when the patient is on a stretcher in a busy ER, or in a waiting room breaches the patient's right to privacy. If a hospitalized pa tient is in a semi-\u00adprivate room, you may want to draw the curtains, or, if the information y ou need to share is sensitive, you ma y want to move to a more private setting. Turning off radios or TV's can be helpful. You may need to ask people to step outside, or include appropriate fa mily members or friends. You should sit down if telling a ll but the most elemental information. ASK: Assess the pat ient's physical and emot ional state If patients express emotional distress, acknowledge, explore an d respond to their feelings at the moment of their expression. If patients are upset or anxious, address their emotions and concerns before trying to share information. Sha ring information when the patient is sleepy, sedated, in pain or emotiona lly distraught is not respectful and the information won' t be remembered. With hospitalized patients, ask if the patient is comf ortable and ready to talk. If they are not comfortable, take steps to assure their comfort. Check o ut the video example about \"assessment of the patient's physica l and emotional state\" on the left.Here are some more examples: Patient A: \"What do you mean I need to have an operation?\" Doctor A: \"I know this is upsetting news. Let me tell you why you need the surgery , then I'd like you to tell me your worries about it, ok? Patient B: \"How can I possibly check my blood sugars, inject insulin, eat and get to school on time? Why can't I just be like everyone else?\" Doctor B: \"I know - sometimes it just doesn' t seem fair. How can I help you with this?\" Patient C: \"Can't you just do an x-\u00adray? Why do I need to have a colonoscopy? My mother in law had tha t and said it was a terrible experience\" Doctor C: \"I'm glad you told me that. I'd like to speak to your concerns. What did she sa y was terrible about it?\" ASK: Assess the patient 's info rmat ional needs Elicit the patient's questions and concerns up f ront, asking \"anything else?\" until the patient acknowledges that all concerns have been expressed. It may be helpf ul to write down the questions and concerns, a nd you ma y need to negotiate priorities a nd timing f or providing extensive informa tion. Find out wha t information the patient wants, and in what f ormat. Some patients want detailed information about their conditions, tests and proposed treatments, recommendations for rea ding, websites, self-\u00adhelp groups, and ref errals to other consultants. Others want an overview and general understanding. Patients may wa nt other family members to be present for support or to help them remember key points. Be prepared to respect the patient's wishes. Reaching agreement with the patient about what information to review may require negotiation if your understanding of the issues, priorities, or goals are different. Also, some patients may need more time, so you might agree to discuss the key points, and plan to address others later, or refer them to other staff or health educators. Doctor A: \"So, tell me all your questions and concerns about your medical problem, and I'll a ddress them one by one.\" Doctor B: \"I have some information I' d like to g o over with you\u2014would you prefer to hear an overview, or lots of the details?\" Doctor C: \"Is there a particular issue you'd like information about right now?\" Doctor D: \"Should we talk about this now or would you rather wait until your daughter comes in?\" Doctor E: \"I know you're upset right now. Should we talk about next steps now, or would you like to wait until I come by tomorrow?\" Case Mr.P and Dr. L. Sometimes the patient's informational needs are greater than the patient imagines. Mr. P. is 76, admitted with worsening angina pectoris in the setting of non-\u00adoperable coronary artery disease. He has diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and renal insuf ficiency, as well a s other chronic medical problems. D uring the admission his anti-\u00adanginal regimen was adjusted and additional medications added for diabetes. A nutritionist talked with Mr. P a bout an a ppropriate diet. Prior to his discha rge, Dr. L sat down with Mr. P. to review his medications and diet and exercise instructions. He looked distracted, so she asked, \"You look preoccupied. What's the matter?\" He replied, \"Well Doctor, the real problem is my wif e. She has multiple sclerosis and I have to lift her onto the commode, wash her up, get her into the chair and then back into bed. I'll be lifting her, feel my angina coming on and it scares me, but what can I do? I just try to tough it out. I have m y son at home. You know, he' s schizophrenic and he's been away for the past month anyway. I've got my sister staying home with my wife now that I'm in here, but she'll have to go back home to her husband. So - I' ll do my best about taking my medicines and eating right and all, but sometimes it's just a bout all I can do to take care of her...and don' t tell me to put her in a nursing home! I don't want to hear about it.\" In Mr. P's situation, information about his medications and disease processes is not sufficient. His clinician needs to think with him about where to get household assistance, how to avoid situations that precipitate his angina , and when to call f or help or emergency services. He also needs ongoing emotiona l and medical support f rom his clinician. ASK: Assess the patient 's kno wledge and on ba seline knowledge-\u00adtargeting your information-\u00adis ef ficient and respectful, and more likely to transfer the new information than if you start with wha tever you assume is most important. Learning theory suggests that a dults learn best by building on previous knowledge. Find out what previous knowledge or relevant experience patients have about a symptom, or about a test or treatment. Include this data as you shape the information you share; you might tell different information about diabetes to a PhD biochemist than to a construction worker. Assess patients' understanding of the nature of their problems in the context of their lives, their motivation toaddress these problems, and the barriers they must overcome. Check o ut the video example about \"assessing the patient's knowledge and understanding\" on the left. Patients may understa nd the essentials of blood suga r control, for example, but their poor control is related to financial a nd social issues. Others, well motivated, do not understand how blood sugar relates to ingestion of certain f oods, or how much insulin to take for a certain blood sugar level. Sometimes when you ask about patients' understanding, they revea l feelings. For example, asking a depressed patient his understanding of depression might elicit, \"I don't know, I guess I' m just a failure...\" Af ter responding to the emotional expression, you can then educate a bout common emotional reactions in depressive disorders, and discuss some of the neurochemical basis of depression. Learn to ask directly: \"Tell me your understanding about the causes and complications of diabetes\" A ssessing patients' understanding of a topic enables you to target your education, and build on the patient's baseline knowledge. ASK: Assess the patient 's attitudes and mot ivation Patients will not be interested in hearing your health information if they are not motivated, or if they have negative attitudes a bout the outcomes of their efforts, so a sk about this directly. You can start by asking general questions about attitudes and motiva tion: \"So - tell me how you feel a bout all of this?\" \"This is a complicated regimen. How do you think you will manage?\" If patients are not motivated, a sk why, and help the patient work through the issues. A useful framework f or understanding and responding to patients' levels of motivation is the Health B elief Model. (see Appendix ) Do not give up when patients express lack of motivation or unwillingness to follow your advice. Good evidence about what you might say and do instea d of using exhortation or admonishments exists, and much of this is outlined in Module 16 For this module, we focus on simpler encounters. ASK: Determine t he patient 's level o f literacy Low literacy is common a nd seriously limits understa nding. Ask simpl e questions that check literacy, a nd learn resources that you can make availa ble to patients. Over 40 million people in this country have low literacy skills and may not be able to read written information. Further, literacy is strongly linked to comprehension of importa nt medical issues.(27 ) For example, a study in both English and Spanish dia betic patients showed tha t only half with low literacy knew the symptoms of hypoglycemia (compared to 94% with higher literacy), and fewer patients with hypertension and low literacy knew that blood pressure could be lowered with diet and exercise.(28 ) Patient education materials, discharge instructions and standard consent f orms are written at higher rea ding levels than many patients can understand.(29 )Do not assume patients' literacy level based upon their level of education or their self-\u00adreported reading abilities, because neither predicts actual literacy.(30,31 ) Check o ut the video example about \"assessment of the patient's level of literacy\" on the left. You can inquire about literacy by a sking: Doctor C: \"How happy are you with the way you read?\"(32 ) Doctor D: \"Some of my patients have trouble with reading. Are you able to read this?\" Patients who ca nnot read are embarrassed, so be sure to respond non-\u00adjudgmentally and with empathy. Familiarize yourself with resources available to help patients in your clinical environment. Verbal review of instructions, checking patients' understanding, clarifying and answering questions, drawing pictures and diagrams each helps pa tients remember and recall information.(33 ) Pictures of clocks indicating the time medicines should be taken, with colored pictures of the pills to be taken (or actual taped-\u00addown samples of the pills) next to the correct time increase understanding a nd adherence. TELL (share) info rmatio n abo ut diagno sis, t reatment or other aspect s of the situat ion Strategies f or TELLING information include: TELL: Keep each bit of info rmat ion brief It is difficult to understand and retain large amounts of information, especially when one is physically ill, upset or fearful. TELL: Use a systematic appro ach Use a template tha t you can practice and repeat consistently. For example, name the problem, the next step, what to expect, and what the patient can do. TELL: suppo rt the patient's prior successes Explicitly mention and appreciate patients' previous efforts and accomplishments in coping with previous problems or illness. TELL: perso nalize the info rmatio n Personalize your information by referring to the patient's personal and f amily history. TELL: Use simple language, avoid jargo n Use simple language and be mindful of how you f rame key points. TELL: Choo se wo rds that do not unnecessarily alarm Words a nd phrases we take f or granted may be misinterpreted or alarm patients and families. TELL: Use Visual Aids/ Share Supplemental Reso urces Find reliable resources and educa tional aids to meet the needs of your patients. TELL: Keep each bit of info rmatio n brief It is difficult to understand and retain large amounts of information, especia lly when one is physically ill, upset or fearful. Share information tha t's based on what the patient wa nts and what you f eel you need to convey. Don't try to convey more than a few pieces of information a t a time. Check o ut the video example about \"keeping ea ch bit of information brief\" on the left. TELL: Use a systematic appro ach Use a templa te that you can practice and repeat consistently. For example, name the problem, the next step, what to expect, and what the patient can do. Use a consistent strategy so you can be organized and more effective at facilitating patients' learning. Ley and collea gues suggest the following basic template for sharing information.(34 ) Modif y this template depending on wha t the patient wants to know and your own personal preferences. Keep your statements brief ; and pause between statements so that patients can keep up with the flow. What you think the problem or diagnosis is. What test or trea tment you think should be offered and why. What to expect. What patients can do to help themselves. For example, \"I think you have a bladder infection. (pause) We'll send your urine sample to the lab to see wha t bacteria is ca using it because this is the second infection you've had in a short period of time, and I want to be sure that I've given you the proper antibiotic, ok?(pause) You should start to feel better within 2 days, but if you're not, or you deve lop a fever please be sure to call me. (pause) Meanwhile, drink plenty of fluids a nd I'll call you when I get the culture report ba ck.\" (pause) When you are about to provide information about several issues, let the patient know yourorganization at the beginning. For exa mple, \"We' ll need to talk about your diet, exercise, and insulin. I think it would be better to focus on your cholesterol at our next visit. Does that sound ok to you?\" TELL: suppo rt the patient's prio r successes Explicitly mention and appreciate patients' previous efforts and accomplishments in coping with previous problems or illness. Reminding patients of previous successful efforts to cope with and ma nage illness supports their strengths and reinf orces self-\u00adconfidence and motiva tion. (35) Most patients can tell you of at least one successful coping strategy or accomplishment if you ask about them explicitly. Patients can draw upon their memories of prior successes to build future efforts. This is especially helpful in helping people change entrenched behaviors.(36 ) You can then respond directly to patients' comments to acknowledge a nd support the attitudes, values, or stra tegies they f ound to be personally helpful in the past. Check o ut the video example about \"supporting the patient' s prior successes\" on the left. \"You've been able to quit smoking in the past a nd that's an excellent predictor that you'll be successful a gain. Let's figure out what worked f or you before.\" (pause, or ASK) \"You've really figured out a great system for recording your sug ars and ma tching them with your symptoms. It's very helpful.\" (pause,or ASK) TELL: perso nalize the info rmat ion Personalize your information by referring to the patient's personal and f amily history. \"We don' t know if your dad had high blood pressure, but since he had a stroke in his 50' s, it's likely that he did. It ma kes it even more important that we work together in keeping your blood pressure norma l.\" (pause, or ASK) \"I know your wife and children mean a lot to you, and th ey need you. You' ve told me tha t you want to see your kids grow up. If we work together to keep your blood sugar normal, and you quit smoking, you have an excellent chance of living a healthy long life. What do you think?\" TELL: Use simple language, avo id jargo n Use simple langua ge, avoid jargon. Use simple, everyda y language. In learning medicine, we are accustomed to complex sentences and long paragra phs. Check o ut the video example about \"using simple language amd avoiding ja rgon\" on the left. As clinicians, we tend to think in a multilayered f ashion, exploring multiple diagnoses, diagnostic strategies a nd treatment options in our minds. Expressing a ll of these details can be conf using, or evoke alarm. Use simple sentences and short paragraphs. Words and phrases we take f or granted, such as \"differenti al diagnosis\" or \"edema,\" are not necessarily f amiliar to patients. Take a moment to organize your thoughts and think a bout how to present information simply, clearly, and without using jargon. TELL: Choo se wo rds that do not unnecessarily alarm Words a nd phrases we take f or granted may be misinterpreted or alarm patients and f amilies. The words we use have a prof ound impact on sick and vulnerable pa tients and their families. Stories abound about the misuse of \"words tha t maim,\" such as referring to left coronary occlusions as \"the widow maker,\" or telling a patient, \"You're living on borrowed time.\"(38 ) Patients' association of the word \"syndrome\" with D own's syndrome during genetics counseling discussions caused signif icant anxiety.(37 ) Other commonly used words, such as, \"cervical incompetence\" or \"congestive heart f ailure\" may leave patients feeling somehow defective or at fault f or their physical conditions. Check o ut the video example about \"choosing words that do not unnecessarily ala rm\" on the left. It is important to provide explanations and information when we discuss diagnosis or prognosis, using commonly understood words like \"cancer\" or \"heart attack\" so that patients and families understand and can plan. TELL: Use Visual Aids/ Share Supplemental Reso urces Find reliable resources and educa tional aids to meet the needs of your patients. Use visual aids or draw pictures to illustra te your points (even if you have no \"artistic\" talent!). Engage your office staff or hospital team to help inform and motiva te patients to utilize other resources. Check o ut the video example about \"sharing supplemental resources\" on the left. Supplement your conversa tions with other educa tional information, such as written flyers, audiotapes, audiovisual material, a nd computer-\u00ada ssisted instruction, including the internet. Refer patients to other providers for additional teaching a nd information. Help your patients locate and enroll in appropriate programs. Know what self-\u00adhelp groups are locally available to provide more information and support. Now tha t you have reviewed the components of TELL, you are ready to finish the sequence, as you attend to checking how the patients are receiving your sharing of information. ASK: Co ntinue to assess needs, co mprehensio n and concerns After each bit of telling, stop and check in with patients. When you think you are about finished, make a final check. (below) This step closes the f eedback loop with patients, and you will understand what pa tients hear, whether they are \"taking home\" the messages you intended a nd how they are feeling about the situation. (You are prepa ring the ground f or Reaching Agreement (Module 11,) and Providing Closure (Module 12)). The second A SK section consist of the following items: ASK: Check fo r patients' comprehensio n ASK about your patients' understanding. This ASK improves patient recall, satisfaction, and adherence. ASK: Check fo appro priat ely Letting patients know that you have heard their concerns and worries is compassiona te, improves outcomes and ta kes little time. ASK: About barriers Patients may fa ce external obstacles as well as internal emotional responses that inhibit them f rom overcoming these obstacles. ASK: Check fo r pat ients' comprehensio n ASK about your patients' understanding. This ASK improves patient recall, satisfaction, and adherence. Up to 40% of patients have problems recalling what was said during medical encounters.(39-\u00ad41 ) Checking for patients' understanding aids patient recall a nd satisfaction with the interview.(42,44 ) Check o ut the video example about \"checking for patients' comprehension\" on the left. Checking for understanding during discussions leading to decisions was rare in a study of audio-\u00ad taped medical off ice visits, occurring in a mere 2% of them.(43 ) A study of videotaped preoperative ca rdiac surgery discussions showed that checking on patients' understanding by clinicians, nurses or health educators occurred in 0.9-\u00ad1.3% of discussions.(44 ) Audiotapes of encounters with low literacy patients with diabetes showed tha t clinicians checked for recall and comprehension in less than 16% of visits after presenting a new concept, and, glycemic control improved when clinicians' did assess understanding.(45 ) Some clinicia ns ask their patients to \"teach back\" what they have learned. This ma y be especially effective for patients with low literacy who cannot rely on written reminders.(34 ) It is important to norma lize the process and put the burden on your own shoulders: \"I alwa ys check in with my patients to make sure that I've explained things clearly. Can you tell me how you're going to take this new medicine?\" If the patient's explanation is incorrect, you should then say, \"I'm sorry, I guess I didn' t explain things all that well: let me try aga in.\" Then go over the inf ormation again and ask the patient to teach it back to you again. In addition to asking patients to repeat back the most important inf ormation and instructions, it is important to encourage patients to voice their questions and concerns. It is best to do this before the end of the encounter when you have the time to address their questions, a nd to ask in and open ended manner. Instead of asking, \"do you have a ny questions?\" to which patients often reply, \"no,\" instead a sk, \"What questions or concerns do you have?\" ASK: appro priat ely Letting patients know that you have heard their concerns and worries is compassionate, improves outcomes and ta kes little time. Patients who a re sick often f eel vulnerable and af raid, and experience a sense of loss of control ove r their lives. Eliciting and responding to patients' f eelings help them f eel joined, supported and cared f or. Many clinicia ns try to express ca ring in their conversations with a thoughtful focus onthe biomedical issues, but avoid talking about any associated f eelings. This \"f ocus on facts\" fails to address patients' needs f or emotiona l support. Patients appreciate being cared for as persons, not just a s diseases. Check o ut the video example about \"checking for emotional responses and respond appropriately\" on the left. This very simple act improves outcomes and need not prolong visit times.(46,47 ) When patients express emotion, either verbally or nonverbally, respond to them with skills we presented in Module 6: name or inquire about the patient's emotion; respond with legitimation or expressions of partnership, reassurance, support or pra ise. Check for emotional reactions: \"How are you feeling a bout all of this?\" \"Are you feeling nervous a bout your... (test/surg ery/chemotherapy)?\" ASK: About barr iers Patients may fa ce many barriers to ensuring health or coping with illness including lack of social support or f inancial resources, f eelings of being overwhelmed, anxious or depressed and others. If you ask patients directly about the obstacles they perceive, you can help them being to think about strategies to overcome them. Check o ut the video example about \"asking about barriers\" on the left. \"Are there any barriers that you can see that might get in the way of your doing this?\" SUMMARY Clinicians ca n share information and build collaborative rela tionships by using specif ic communication strategies. Use ASK-\u00adTELL-\u00adASK to stay in dialogue and to assess and respond to patients' information needs and emotions. (Use emotion-\u00adresponding skills f rom Module 6.) Celebra te and support patients' successes. These ef forts will help meet your patients' needs and improve their clinical outcomes. BEHAVIOR SKILLS CHECKLIST ASK to assess pat ient needs: 1. Make sure the setting is conducive. 2. Assess the patient's physical and emotional state. 3. Assess the patient's informational needs 4. Assess the patient's knowledge and understanding. 5. Assess the patient's attitudes and motiva tion 6. Assess the patient's level of literacy. TELL informatio n 7. Keep any one presenta tion or statement brief 8. Use a systematic a pproach 9. Build on the patient's prior experience 10. Personalize informa tion 11. Use simple language, avoid jargon 12. Choose words that do not unnecessarily a larm 13. Use visual aids and off er supplemental ma terials ASK abo ut the patient 's understanding, emo tional react ions and concerns. 14. Assess and check the patient's understanding 15. Elicit concerns and/or questions 16. Elicit and respond to the pa tient's feelings 17. Assess Barriers APPENDIX -\u00ad Health Belief Mo del Certain theories of patient health promoting behaviors are useful to know and can guide your counseling. For example, you could elicit and respond to patients' thoughts about the components of the Health B elief Model, as it applies in their situations. This model was designed to help explain why people undertake health promoting beha viors or comply with recommended treatments f or illnesses. It asserts that patients' behaviors are rela ted to certain perceptions and attitudes about health behaviors. This table summarizes the core concepts of the model: Definitio n Applicatio n Perceived Suscept ibilityOne's opinion of chances of getting a conditionDefine population(s) a t risk, risk levels. Personalize risk based on a person's f eatures or behavior. Heighten perceived susceptibility if too low.Perceived SeverityOne's opinion of how serious a condition and its sequelae areSpecif y consequences of the risk and the condition. Correct misperceptions, cha llenge patient denial. Perceived BenefitsOne's opinion of the ef ficacy of the advised action to reduce risk or seriousness of impactOffer your opinion of the efficacy of the advised action to reduce risk or seriousness of impact Define a ction to take: how, where, when; clarify the positive eff ects to be expected from these actions. Perceived BarriersOne's opinion of the tangible and psychological costs of the advised actionIdentify and reduce barriers through reassurance, incentives, assistance. Cues t o ActionEvents, either bodily (e.g., physical symptoms of a health condition) or environmental (e.g., media publicity) that motivate people to take a ction.Offer strategies to activate 'readiness.' Provide how-\u00adto information, promote awareness, reminders. Self-\u00adEfficacyConfid ence in one's ability to take actionProvide training, guidance in performing a ction. Give positive feedback, support successes. Adapted from: http://www.comminit.com/changetheories/ctheories/cha ngetheories-\u00ad31.html LITERATURE REFERENCES 1. Deber RB , Kraetschmer N, Irving J.

We all have experience with rea ching a greements with f riends and family every day. What are your strengths in helping others reach agreements? What gets in the way? 2. How effectively do you listen to the wishes, intentions, and preferences of others? How often do you assume you know what these are? 3. What skills would you use to help you reach agreement with patients with whom you disagree on their wishes or pref erences for diagnostic or treatment plans? 4. What kinds of patients or patient behaviors might get in the wa y of your negotiating agreements about diagnostic or treatment plans? 5. How might preconceived notions or judgments about patients get in the way of your reaching agreements with patients? Key Principles: 1. An effective process of reaching agreement and making decisions about diagnostic or treatment plans is based on a collaborative model of the patient-\u00adclinician relationship. 2. The majority of patients wa nt information about their health, illnesses and decision options, but their pref erences about participation in decision making are quite variable. 3. Substantia l empirical evidence shows that patients' active participation in their health care and pla nning enhances hea lth outcomes as well a s patient satisfaction. 4. In a collaborative model, topics to be discussed in order to reach agreement with patients and fa milies include the following: the nature of the problem the roles a nd responsibilities of both the patient and clinician the goals of treatment 5. The process of reaching a greement includes explicit communication skills, with the conversation elaborated or collapsed, depending on the complexity of the decision to be made. Learning go als: At the co nclusion o f this mo dule, yo u will be able to : Describe conceptual models of decision making and rea ching a greement. Describe evidence regarding patient participation in their decisions and care. Describe their own attitudes, preferences and approaches to partnering with patients in decision making.Describe and demonstrate skills f or reaching agreement about decisions and plans. INTRODUCTION TO \"REACHING AGREEMENT\" Reaching agreement is a complex process that includes identifying the nature of the problem, defining pref erred roles a nd involvement in decision making, agreeing on goals, and gathering and sharing biomedical and psychosocial inf ormation. Participa nts in this process must a ddress feelings, concerns, and preferences, while building consensus and colla borating to c reate shared decisions. Checking for mutual understa nding helps to clarify and confirm agreement. After you have elicited the patient's history, completed the physical exam and formulated your thoughts a bout the patient's problems and how to manage them, the next step is discussing your ideas with patients, listening to their ideas, and reaching agreement about the pla ns. Without this critical step, pa tients in the hospital cannot know and have no say in what's happening or being done to them and why. Ambulatory patients face the same dilemma, but in this setting, the implementation of the plans rests in their hands. The way you go about reaching agreement with patients will reflect your belief s about the roles of patient and clinician, and your a pproach to the patient-\u00adclinician relationship. MODELS OF DECISION-\u00adMAKING BETWEEN PATIENTS AND CLINICIANS Both patients and providers can be trained to enhance participatory styles of communication, resulting in improved health outcomes. Patients' involvement in decisions about their care is an increasingly important priority for healthcare providers, policy makers, medical organizations, and the public sector(1-\u00ad3 ). During recent decades, medical ethicists ha ve emphasized the importa nce of patient autonomy and respect for the patient' s right to self-\u00addetermination(4,5 ). Research contributions suggesting that patient pa rticipation enhances health outcomes have combined with these socia l forces to induce signif icant digms help us conceptualize the nature of the decision making aspects of the clinician-\u00ad patient relationship. In the \"paternalistic\" model, the benef icent clinician makes decisions on behalf of pat ients without including them. At the other end of the spectrum, in the \"informed consumer\" model, patients gather information from multiple sources, including from their clinicians in order to choose among available treatment options. In this model, the patient makes decisions independently and autonomously and the clinician' s role is primarily as one source of information. In the \"professional as agent\" paradigm, clinicians make choices on behalf of patients based on what they know (or assume) about patients' preferences. In yet another model, \"collaborative,\" clinicians and patients share information and preferences and search for consensus about diagnostic a nd treatment decisions and pla ns (6). The latter model requires clinicians' willingness to collaborate, a nd pa tients' willingness to participate and assume shared responsibility for decisions. Patient preferences and clinician co mmunicat ion behavio rs Patients wa nt information but va ry in their interest in actively collaborating in decisions. Clinicians are not good judges of their patients' preferences for decision-\u00admaking. A 1980's Harris poll of patients and clinicians undertaken for a President' s Commission f or the study of ethical problems in medicine and biomedical resea rch indicated that 72% percent of patients thought the patient and doctor should discuss alternatives about a clinica l decision and decide together wha t to do(7 ). Only 7% wanted the doctor to present alternatives and let the patient decide, a nd another 7% wanted the doctor to decide f or them. Twelve percent wanted the doctor to present a recommendation f or the patient to accept or reject. A later cross-\u00adnational study of Australian, UK and US preferences also indicated tha t participants preferred mutual or joint decision-\u00admaking(8 ). Clinicians' communication practices have not kept pace with these patient preferences. A study of over one thousa nd audio taped off ice visits of US primary care clinicia ns and surgeons showed that only 9% of decisions met criteria for fully informed decision-\u00admaking (9 ). Another group studied \"routine\" clinical decisions and found that the most f requently discussed element (83% of discussions) was the nat ure of the problem, whereas discussions of risks and benefits and assessment of patient understanding were infrequent (9% and 2% of discussions respectively (10)). Forty per cent of over 6,000 hospitalized patients in a recent nationwide survey said they did not have enough say in their in-\u00adhospital care (11). Most patients want information a bout their illnesses and decision options, but their pref erences for participation in decision making a re variable.(12,13 ), Even those patients who wish to actively collaborate in decision making may not wish to do so in every instance, depending in part on the patient's age, culture, acuity, a nd severity of illness (14-\u00ad16 ). Unfortunately, clinicians are often poor judges of their patients' preferences about participation in decision making (17). Patient part icipat ion in decisio ns and healt h outcomes Psychological and physical health, eff iciency of ca re, and frequency of malpractice claims improve when patients are more involved in decisions about their care. Focused interventions, either with patients or their clinicians, enhance patient involvement in decision-\u00admaking. Giving patients information and colla borating actively with them about their care enhances psychological a nd physical health outcomes. Stewart comprehensively summarized the evidence that four communication elements directly enhanced emotional a nd physical health, symptom resolution, and functional status. The f our key elements included: 1. provision of clear information 2. questions from the patient 3. willingness to discuss and share decisions 4. agreement between patient and clinicia n about the problem and plans (18) Patients' perceptions of reaching a greement about clinical decisions have been correlated with improved efficiency of ca re, ref lected by f ewer dia gnostic tests and referrals. (19). An intensive communication intervention for critically ill patients in which patients, families a nd the critical care team together discussed goa ls, expectations and care plans resulted in reduced ICU stays for patients who died, and in earlier access to palliative care f or dying patients.(20 ) Several studies have correlated malpractice claims with clinicia n communication tha t failed to involve the patient in decisions about care. The communication problems cited included inadequate discussion of diagnosis or treatment plans, patients f eeling ignored, a nd devaluing or f ailing to understa nd patient and family perspectives. (21 ) Communication skills training for patients or clinicians ca n enhance collabora tive participation and clinica l outcomes. Interventions with patients have included detailed review of their problems andindividua l coaching (22,23 ), provision of written information and verbal encouragement to participate in decisions to the extent desired (24,25 ), and provision of a communications training workbook prior to scheduled office visits(26-\u00ad28 ). The results of these interventions are enhanced participation in primary care interviews (27 ), assumption of a more active role in decision making (24,25 ), improved health outcomes (blood pressure and glucose control), and improved functional status (22,23 ). Studies of communication skills training interventions for health care providers (primarily primary care clinicia ns) show increased f ocus on patients' pref erences and shared control of clinical decisions with associated signif icant increases in patient satisfaction (29 ). DOMAINS FOR REACHING AGREEMENT OR UNDERSTANDING WITH PATIENTS AND FAMILIES A collaborative approach to decision making requires the integra tion of the knowledge, values, needs and preferences of both pa tients and clinicians. The clinical encounter is a \"meeting between experts(30 ),\" to which patients bring expertise about their life context, concerns, belief s and values, and clinicians bring biomedical and technical expertise. This colla borative, relationship-\u00adcentered ca re approach requires mutual respect and willingness to share control a nd responsibility f or decisions and pla ns. It is not an \"either/or\" approach, but a \"both/and\" approach(31 ). The tasks of building, understanding a nd reaching agreement occur in the following key domains, and we describe co mmunicat ion skills within each o f these do mains in the fo llowing sectio ns: What is the nature o f the problem? What are t he preferred roles of the participants in decisio n making? What are t he go als o f treatment? What is to be do ne? How will t he plans be implemented? What is the nature o f the problem? It can be difficult to reach agreement about what should be done if you and the patient have different ideas about the nature of a problem. This aspect of finding common ground requires understanding the patient's expla natory model, including their perspective regarding the cause of the problem, its severity, and its expected course. Illust rative case: Mr. H's sto machache Mr. H. is a 32 year old construction worker whom you've seen once for an initial visit. He described occasional episodes of cramps a nd diarrhea, and a previous clinician had prescribed an antispa smodic agent f or presumed irritable bowel syndrome. Mr. H. had no symptoms a t the time of your visit and you suggested that he come in to see you if the symptoms reoccurred. Mr. H: \"Hi Doc. Good to see you . Listen, I think my 'irritable bowel' problem is kicking up again. You know, tha t doctor that was here before you gave me a medicine f or stomach spasms and I wondered if I could get some more. I' ve had a lot of diarrhea and cra mps lately.\"Dr. D: \"Well, let's hear a bit more. Is anything different f rom previous episodes?\" Mr. H: \"Actually I've been seeing some blood mixed in with the stool and in the toilet water. I thought maybe I aggravated some hemorrhoids with all the diarrhea.\" Dr. D: \"Hm. How long has that been happening?\" Mr. H: \"Of f and on for about 6-\u00ad8 weeks I'd sa y.\" Dr. D: \"Ok, and are you having any pain in your belly?\" Mr. H: \"It comes and goes, but it feels kind of uncomf ortable down low on the left a lot.\" Dr. D: \"I' ll want you to show me where when I examine you. Now, my assistant recorded your weight as 157. That's down 8 pounds since I last saw you a few months ago.\" Mr. H: \"Yuh, I think what with the cra mps a nd diarrhea I haven't felt much like eating .\" In this vignette, Mr. H believes his symptoms are due to irritable bowel syndrome. He minimizes the significance of the blood in the stool, pain, and weight loss, perhaps due to anxiety, denial or inadequate knowledge about their signif icance. Dr. D: \"So it sounds like you're thinking that these symptoms are due to irritable bowel syndrome and hemorrhoids?\"Mr. H: \"That's what I was thinking I guess...why, what do you think?\" Dr. D: \"I'm concerned that there might be more going on. Irritable bowel does not usually cause bloody diarrhea, localized pain and weight loss.\" Mr. H: \"What do you think is going on?\" Dr. D: \"I' m not sure. The symptoms you describe may be caused by patches of inflamed bowel, chronic infection, sometimes even a tumor. We ' ll need more information to make good decisions a bout treatment. I think we should do some tests to see if you have an area of bleeding in the bowel.. What are you thinking about a ll of this?\"Mr. H: \"Like wha t kinds of tests?\" As the conversation progresses, D r. D ask about the pa tient's understanding, needs and feelings about the problem (see D ocCom module 9) then begins to share information and answer questions (see module 10).If Dr. D advises a procedure without trying to reach common ground on the nature and implications of the patient's symptoms, Mr. H may feel confused, angry, or compelled into an ac tion plan he doesn' t understand and isn't ready to accept. D r. D's task now is to share additional inf ormation about the significa nce of Mr. H's symptoms, a nd how the tests will help establish a diagnosis. The patient and clinicia n may not fully a gree, but if they respect each other' s explanations, it may be possible to integrate, or to try para llel approaches to the diagnostic or treatment plans. What are the preferred ro les o f the participants in decisio n making? Patients' preferences may change in different situations, so it's important to ask explicitly about their preferences f or participa ting in decision-\u00admaking. Sharing responsibility for decisions does not mean abandoning the patient. When clinicians express their opinions, give advice, and offer guidance, patients feel supported a nd clinicia ns fulfill their professional responsibilities. (32) Some patients wa nt their clinicians to make decisions for them, while others want to act independently. Patients who want the clinicia n to make decisions for them however, will usually engage in conversations about their goa ls for health and qua lity of life in illness. Ultima te choices belong to the f ully informed patients. (33) However, this does not mean that clinicians should abandon patients as they make decisions. Clinicians are responsible f or continuing to actively participate in their patients' care and follow-\u00adup while patients are responsibile for implementing agreed upon plans once they leave the hospital or office setting. At times f ull agreement cannot be reached. If the disagreement is serious, the patient and clinician may have to decide whether or not to continue their rela tionship. Fortunately, this is an infrequent occurrence. Illust rative case co ntinued: Mr. H's sto machache Dr. D: \"We can do simple blood tests a nd send a stool specimen to the lab, and I'd like you to see a gastroenterologist to look inside the bowel directly.\" Mr. H: \"Do you really think that's necessary? I thoug ht this was a flare up of these old problems.\" Dr. D: \"Well, that may be, but I wouldn' t want to assume your symptoms are due to irritable bowel and hemorrhoids until we exclude other problems. What questions do you have at this point?\" Mr. H: \"I understand that we need to figure out what's g oing on. I just don't like the idea of it. I'd like to speak with my brother about it. He' s a doctor.\" Dr. D: \"I' d be happy to speak with your brother if you'd like. How are you feeling right now?\"Mr. H: \"Anxious.\" Dr. D: \"What concerns you the most? Mr. H: \"Could this be a cancer, Doc?\" Dr. D: \"I can understand your worry a bout tha t. I am concerned, too, but we don' t know enough at this point, and we will discuss your lab results as they emerge. How can I be most helpf ul to you right now?\" Mr. H: \"I just need to think about this.\" Dr. D: \" Ok. How shall we make a decision about wha t to do next?\" Mr. H: \"How about if I give you a call in a couple of days.\" Dr. D: \"That sounds f ine.\" Mr. H. indica tes he is willing to listen to Dr. D's advice, but also wa nts to participate in the decision making by weighing the necessity for a referral, a nd by speaking with trusted advisors. He also needs time to absorb the information about the potential seriousness of his symptoms before he can agree on a diagnostic plan. Dr. D for his part, must realize that he has just shared difficult news, and respect the patient's need f or time to think a nd to seek additional a dvice, without f eeling that his authority is being challenged.Other strategies that Dr. D could try in clarifying the role Mr. H would like to play in ma king decisions about tests and management options include: How shall we make this decision? It sounds like you'd like to think a bout this, do some reading, and ta lk about it more later. Check o ut the video example about \"decision making\" on the left. Sometimes clinicians and patients desire the input of others, such as consultants or the patient's signif icant others. Strategies that D r. D could try include: Is there anyone you'd like me to speak with? I'd like to get some advice from one of my consultants who specializes in this field. Check o ut the video example about \"consultation\" on the left. What are t he go als o f treatment? Patients' goals may change as they live through an illness. This observation, and the fact that clinicians are inadequate judges of patients' preferences, highlights the necessity to revisit the complex decisions about diagnosis a nd treatment as time goes by. After sharing information to understand each other 's definition of the problem, the next step is establishing mutual understanding of the patient's and clinician' s goa ls for a proposed diagnostic or treatment plan. D eber makes the distinction between patient's desires to participate in decisions by weighing values and alternatives, versus \"problem-\u00adsolving\" or making technical decisions about which specific tests or treatments are medically likely to clarify or resolve a problem. She postulates that most patients want to participate in weighing decisions, but not in deciding the technical aspects of care. (33) Quill and Brody also advise clinicians to focus f irst on overall goals, rather than technical or specific aspects of treatment. Clarifying the goalsCheck o ut the video example about \"clarifying the goals of treatment\" on the left. Illust rative case abo ut Mr. P's cancer and Resident W. Mr. P. was an elderly successf ul businessman recently diagnosed with metastatic lung cancer. Mr. P. asked his f amily and D r. L. to sustain him with whatever treatments his clinicia ns thought indica ted until his quality of life or clarity of mind were compromised, at which time he preferred to be kept comfortable. He remained functional f or a few weeks until his wif e noticed that he was having word-\u00adfinding difficulty. D r. L. then noted brain metastases and initiated radiation, anticonvulsant, and steroid therapy. Mr. P. agreed, but by the 3rd hospital day, he was exhausted and asked for a respite from radiation treatments. The house staff noted his limited oral in take and abnormal electrolytes, renal and liver f unction. Resident W: \"Hi Mr. P. Your labs look like you're dehydrated and your nutrition is poor. I'm going to start a long intravenous line so we can g ive you some fluids and total parenteral nutrition.\" Mr. P. said quietly, \"Why? It's too late for that. I don't want any of this. I want to go home.\" Strategies to help establish the patients goals of heal th and illness management include: What are your hopes and goals for your health? What's most important to you at this stage of your illness? (also see module 9) What is to be do ne? The first tenet of a sha red decision is that it must meet the goals agreed upon by both patient and clinician. The processes involved in reaching such an agreement are the following: both patient and clinician participate both patient and clinician share inf ormation including medical knowledge, values, beliefs, concerns, thoughts a nd goals both express their pref erences both agree to the plans (35 ) The processes of gathering and sharing information, building consensus, a nd reaching agreement are complex, and are sometimes daunting beca use of the nature of clinical uncertainty (36 ). Clinical uncertainties ma ke communication of risk to patients extremely complex and dif ficult. The way professionals f rame information about risks and benef its greatly aff ects how patients receive and act upon this information. For exa mple, positive f raming spoken in terms of chance o f survival is more persuasive in encouraging patients to take risky options than negative framingspoken in terms of chance of deat h (37 ). The skills to accomplish this are always relevant, and the conversation may be elaborated or truncated according to the complexity of the decision. In the face of urgent decisions, clinicia ns are likely to give too much information too quickly, and to attempt to persuade patients instead of helping them reach the best decision. Having a skill set and strategies available is essentia l to reaching agree ment with patients. The chart below provides a guideline of communication skills f or reaching agreement, with examples of clinician statements and questions to implement the skills. Skills guideline Skills examples Present options including the proposed plans/procedure, it's risks, benefits, a nd alternatives. (See M17)\"One option would be to do this procedure/take this medication. It's risks are...The bene fits are... Alternatives would include...\" \"The absolute risk of a woman/ma n having this disease by age ... is 1 in (x)...This intervention will increase/decrease this risk to 1 in (y).\" \"The risk of serious side effects from this intervention is...\" \"Let's think about what this means for you personally.\" Be explicit a bout the limits of your own knowledge and the scientif ic evidence available.\"Statistics give us an accurate picture of what happens within a group of people, but cannot tell us what will happen f or any particular individual -you, for example-\u00ad in that group.\" \"Data about the this medication/procedure or scanty).\" \"I'm not certa in about the data/best thing to do in your situation.

Right now, I see you are not ready to make a decision yet.\" Clinicians see the problems, pain and suff ering tha t may arise if urgent measures are delayed bypatients' ambiva lence or reluctance B ecause we wish to spare patients a s much suff ering as possible, we ma y try to explain too much, give too much information and fa il to apprecia te patients' decision dilemmas. We may marshal as much evidence for our recommenda tion as possible, trying to persuade the patient to do the \"right thing\" especially if we foresee dire consequences. The communication dynamic becomes distorted because pa tients cannot absorb excessive information, and too much persu asion tends to result in resistance. These communication dilemmas can be repaired by listening and responding to patients' views instead of repeating, reconfiguring or bolstering our own. Our professional obligation is to integrate our own expertise and preferences with our patients' so that they can live their lives, and make decisions as they see fit. How will t he plans be implemented? Patients liv e in their own worlds where decisions are activated only if they choose and are able to implement the plans. The realities of daily living a nd contextual factors alter patients' readiness to contemplate the changes necessary for self-\u00adcare, and their ability to carry them out. It's important to reiterate the agreed upon plans, to check f or mutual understanding, and probe whether the patient is able t o implement them. Sometimes, the patient simply is not able to follow through with the agreed upon plans. Mrs. N's Dilemma Mrs. N. incurred a n ankle injury when she was running across a playground to reach her toddler. Her clinician found a severe sprain, and prescribed ice, leg elevation, non-\u00adsteroidal anti-\u00ad inflammatory medications and crutches. She returned a week later with continued pain and swellin g. Her clinician asked if she had followed instructions, and she replied that she had not. When asked, she explained that she waitresses during the day while her son stays with a neighbor. Her fa mily lives in Canada. Af ter work it is impossible to elevate her leg or use crutches as she either used the stroller or carried her son when outside, and inside he is \"all over the place!\" She felt embarrassed to share this and feared that her clinician would interpret her reluctance as a rejection of his advice. Skills guideline Skills examples Check for mutual understa nding \"Just so I can be sure I've been clear, let's summarize the plans.\" Check for readiness, barriers and need for additional resources\"How ready do you feel to pursue this plan?\" \"What problems do you anticipate in carrying out these plans?\" \"What resources might be helpful?\" In situations like Mrs. N's, the clinician' s responsibility is to continue to be supportive, provide information, identify barriers and problem-\u00adsolve with the patient. The clinicia n may identify other professionals to serve as resources, such a s patient educators and social workers. S imilarly, the patient may identify family or friends as resources and supports.Check o ut the video example on the left. Mr. W.'s Hepatitis C and Dr A. Dr. A, the primary care clinicia n for 43 year old Mr. W., made the diagnosis of Hepatitis C. She frequently urged him to stop drinking alcohol, explaining that a lcohol hastens progression to cirrhosis. Mr. W. did not agree that his six beers nightly was a problem, after all he had his job and no legal or other diff iculties, and his wife drank with him. D r. A. inquired periodically about his thoughts a nd feelings about drinking, continuing to share her concern that alcohol was harmful f or his health. One day, 5 yea rs after he entered her practice, he told her he had quit drinking. \"Why now?\" asked D r. A. \"Because I was ready, my wife quit, and you told me to,\" he replied. Clinicians should look at inability to follow through with agreed plans as a signal to reappraise the feasibility of the decisions made, rather than labeling the patient as \"non-\u00adcompliant.\" When this occurs, the patient and clinician should identify barriers to implementation, problem-\u00adsolve together, and identify available resources and other people to help. Additional communication skills are applicable in situations where pa tients chronically f ail to impleme nt plans (see module 16), or cannot agree with a diagnosis (especially stigma tized diagnoses, like a lcoholism (see module 29), depression (see module 27) or HIV infection. SUMMARY Reaching agreement is a complex process that begins with identifying the nature of the problem, defining pref erred roles and involvement in decision making, and agreeing on goals for the next steps. It also includes gathering and sharing information about biomedical knowledge, feelings, concerns, and preferences, toward building consensus and collaborating to create shared decisions. The clinician and pa tient work toward mutual understanding. In the collaborative model, inability of patients to follow agreed upon plans signa ls the need for reassessment of prior decisions, rather than labels of noncompliance. Clinicians ca n enhance their patients' clinica l outcomes and satisfaction by using this collabora tive model. COMMON PITFALLS Making assumptions about patients' preferences for participation in decisions.Failure to discuss and def ine the nature of the problem. Failure to discuss and agree on the goals of treatment. Recommending a nd prescribing plans and instructions without working through the processes needed to reach agreement. Overlooking the need to re-\u00adevaluate goa ls and decisions over the course of a patient's illness. Interpreting a patient's failure to implement agreed upon plans as \"non-\u00adcompliance\" rather than checking understanding, identifying barriers, a nd problem-\u00adsolving together if the patient is willing. Behavior Skills Checklist Ask about the patient's understanding, needs and feelings about the problem. Share information and answer questions. Clarify the role the patient would like to play in making decisions about diagnostic tests a nd management options. Involve consultants and the patient's significant others as desired. Ask patients about their goals for health and illness management. Present options, including risks, benef its, and alternatives. Be explicit a bout the limits of your own knowledge and the scientif ic evidence available. Elicit the patient's pref erences about the available options. Present your own opinion and advice. Acknowledge non-\u00adjudgmentally areas of agreement and disa greement. Valida te the patient's right to make choices. Work with the pa tient to integra te their feelings and preferences into a mutually agreeable decision. Check for mutual understa nding. Check for readiness, barriers and need for additional resources. Bibliography 1. Committee on Quality of HealthCare in America, Institute of Medicine.

What barriers might there be for you either in the patient' s behavior or in yourself that might limit your ablilty to close an interview smoothly? 3.

Before you attempt to close, use these strategies to a void unduly prolonged closure: orient your patients to the flow of the encounter elicit their perspectives throughout the encounter reach agreement before you try to close 3. Your major tasks at closure are the following: check understanding of the plans arrange follow-\u00adup express support until next time.

INTRODUCTION Closing an interview is a complex endeavor, and your success depends both on your skillful approach to preceding interview segments and the skills you employ in the closing moments. The closure of any patient encounter includes specific behaviors a nd interactions that influence the patient's implementation of plans, the patient's health, and the patient-\u00adclinician relationship. (1,2) Yet, studies indicate that the closing moments of an encounter are quite brief. In one study, visitsaveraged 16.8 minutes and in 72% of them, closure lasted less than 1 minute.(3 ) Effective beginnings f acilitate successf ul completions, so your skillful execution of earlier interview segments greatly facilitates effective closure. WHY DOES CLOSURE DIFFER FROM SHARING AND PLANNING, AND WHEN DOES CLOSURE BEGIN? As the end of the visit approaches, conversation turns f rom the present to the future. The challenge is achieving clea r agreement on what ha ppens next. Use the skills of summarizing, clarifying, expressing supporting, a nd saying goodbye. Closure is the time f or checking and reviewing plans, expressing support, and saying goodbye. In actual interviews, a demarcation line between reaching agreement on plans and closure of the interview is seldom clear. At the close of visits the conversation shifts f rom a present to a future orientation, and the clinician and pa tient confirm that they each understand and agree about wha t will happen next. (4 ) The tasks of closure include orienting the patient to the close of the visit, summarizing, reviewing a nd checking the diagnostic or trea tment plans for understanding, clarifying and arranging follow-\u00adup, and acknowledging, reassuring or supporting the pa tient before saying goodbye. (3) Problem: Interrupted o r pro longed clo sures Welcome explora tions of new topics early in interviews, but toward the end, keep invita tions to explore new material to a minimum in order to eff iciently bring the interview to a close. Certain clinician behaviors prolong closure; such a s eliciting new concerns during closure rather than earlier in the interview, (4 ) or failing to reach common ground on an issue with a patient. Prolonged closures are less likely when you take time at the beginning to orient patients to the flow of the visit, to elicit concerns, to give adequate information about trea tment plans, to explore patients' belief s, and to respond to patients' f eelings. (3) If you or your patients introduce new or unresolved issues late in the interview, this action prolongs or interrupts eff ective closure. Of ten patients fail to disclose the issues that are really bothering them until they perceive tha t their clinicia n is starting to close the interview. Usually, these \"hidden agendas\" appear because they are dif ficult psychosocial concerns or physica l symptoms that cause the patient anxiety, or a re known to be associated with potentia lly serious implications, such as chest pain.(6 ) Sometimes new issues arise late because they emerge as the conversation evolves, or because the patient or clinician simply f orgot about something. This \"Oh, by the way....\" phenomenon is frustrating because seldom does sufficient time remain for thoughtful eva luation of late topics. (3 ) When new issues arise late in the interview, you may need to return to earlier phases of the interview, such as exploring the history, sharing information, and rea ching a greement about new plans, particula rly if the new information is clinically important. This tends to interrupt or prolong closure. If a new issue is not pressing, both patient and clinician may agree to bring it up at a later visit. Positive social talk, chatting, laughing, expressing concern, a nd sharing personal information at the end of a visit may also prolong closure, which is not to say that this is \"bad!\" This portion of the interaction is when the patient and clinicia n get to relax and connect on a personal level after the \"business\" of the encounter is completed. (3, 4 )Preventing clo sure pro blems Use eff ective interview skills ea rly in interviews to avoid common closure problems. Then transition to specif ic closing strategies a nd skills, such as, alerting patients tha t your time together is drawing to a close, summarizing plans and arranging f ollow up. Specific clinician behavio rs enacted before the clo sing phase o f the int erview help t o facilitate effective and uni nterrupted clo sures. These include: (4,5,7 ) Orient the patient to the time frame and ta sks of the visit during the early phases of the encounter. (see module 7, \"Opens the discussion.\") Elicit concerns and ask, \"Anything else?\" both early in the interview, and throughout it. (see module 7) Elicit patients' belief s about their illness. (see module 9, \"Understands the patient's perspective) Reach agreement on what should be done about evaluation or treatment of the illness. (See Module 9, \"Reaches agreement.\") Skills that facilitate smoo th and effective clo sure include: Alert patients that you are drawing the visit to a close. \"We have a bout 5 minutes left, let's think about where to go from here.\" Summarize the visit. \"We've talked about your symptoms and your exa m ...as I said, I think we can just wait and wa tch you closely/treat you with...\" Review ca re plans and check f or understanding. \"So let's start you on...\" \"It sounds like you're willing to give diet a nd exercise a try first before we begin a new medication...ha ve I g ot this right?\" \"What concerns have we not addressed?\" \"Do you have any f urther questions?\" Make plans for interim contact and follow-\u00adup. \"Let's make an appointment for you to come back in...In the meantime, if you have any problems or questions I' d like you to call me.\" Acknowledge the patient by expressing caring, reassura nce a nd salutations until next time. \"It wa s good to see you again.\" \"I' ll be here if you need help.\" \"Take ca re of yourself and say hello to your husba nd for me.\" Case: Learner B. and Mrs. D: The learner prepares a smooth pathway towards uninterrupted closure of her hospital visit, and then includes in her closure a summary of what to expect, how to get in touch, confirmation of the next contact time, and a depa rting salutation. Learne r B. is concluding her admission interview with Mrs. D for diabetes and cellulitis which is not responding to oral a ntibiotics.Moving toward clo sure: Learner B: \"So it sounds like you understand tha t we admitted you to the hospital beca use the infection a nd swelling in your leg seemed to be getting worse in spite of the antibiotics. We'll also adjust your insulin. I think the resident expla ined that we plan to do an ultrasound on your leg to be sure there are no blood clots in your leg that could be contributing to the swellin g around your ankle, right?\" Mrs. D: \"Right. He said that the ultrasound was done with sound waves, not x-\u00adra ys. It sounded pretty easy.\" Learner B: \"That' s right. Did you have any additiona l questions about the test or the plans?\" Mrs. D: \"No, it all sounds reasonable. How long do I have to be in here?\" Learner B: \"I'll check with the team, but I think that if your ultrasound is normal, as soon as we see that your infection is clearing you'll be able to g o home. Maybe a couple of days. Any other concerns?\" Mrs. D: \"How will I know wha t to do about my insulin?\" Learner B: \"We' ll go over that with you while you're here.\" Mrs. D: \"Will I be able to get up and walk around?\" Learner B: \"We' ll want you to keep your leg elevated while you're in bed, but if your ultrasound looks clear, you can g et up to the bathroom.\" Mrs. D: \"Ok. I' ll go nuts if I have to stay in bed.\" Learner B: \"I can certainly understa nd that.\" Mrs. D: \"Why do you think this happened? I've never had anything like this before.\" Learner B: \"I don't know for sure, but you have a little f ungal infection that may have allowed bacteria to get in through tiny skin cracks between your toes. It's important to take care of that because of your di abetes, so we' re giving you something to get rid of that a s well. Did you have some thoughts about wha t was causing this?\" Mrs. D: \"I thought maybe I did wrong by trimming my own nails. My doc keeps telling me to go to a podiatrist but I didn' t have the time.\" Learner B: \"Well, that' s certainly another thought, a lthough I didn't see any cuts or any obvious areas of infection a round your toenails. I'll check a gain, and ma ybe we can set you up with the podiatry clinic. Did you have any other concerns or questions?\" Mrs. D: \"Not right now but I'm sure my husband will when he comes in.\" Transitio n and clo sure: Learner B: \"Ok, that's fine. I'm finished f or now, but I' ll be in the hospital if you want to page me when he comes.\" Mrs. D: \"That would be great.\" Learner B: \"Good. So we' ll send you to ultrasoun d and then to your room. Your IV a ntibiotics are started. You'll page me when your husband g ets here or if you have any questions, and I'll see you with the rest of the team first thing in the morning. Ok?\" Mrs. D: \"Sounds good. Thank you.\" Learner B: \"You're welcome. See you later.\" In this dia logue, the student checks on the patient's understanding of the reasons for admission, shares information abou t what to expect next, asks about the patient's beliefs a bout what caused her illness, and elicits her questions and concerns three times before she effectively transitions into closure. Lea rner B 's use of these skills permits her to effectively close with a brief summary of what to expect, how to get in touch, confirmation of the next contact time, and a departing salutation. CLOSURE OF BRIEF PATIENT-\u00ad CLINICIAN RELATIONSHIPS Clinicians must frequently say goodbye to patients, and sometimes you may feel sad about the separation from the intimacy of these relationships, even if the time spent ha s been (relatively) short. At all stages of training and practice you will say goodbye to many patients whom you know you will not see again. This will happen in the hospital and emergency room, with consultations and brief surgeries, when cross-\u00adcovering for colleagues, with clinic patients who are relocating out of town, and with patients who are terminally ill and dying. (Termination of extended clinician-\u00adpatient relationships will be addressed in Module 36, a nd saying goodbye to a dying patient in Module 31) Patients are admitted and discharged quickly from the hospital these days. However, the patients' hospitaliza tion is the only one they are experiencing a nd it is a traumatic life event that is accompanied by worry and fears. Patients need to connect with you despite short stays, and especia lly will a ppreciate expressions of caring during the time you spend with them. Taking a moment to acknowledge the person, to wish him or her well, and to say goodbye is an expression of respect, and a symbolic marker that the hospitaliza tion experience has concluded. This small gesture of compassion can have a very large effect, and help patients accommodate to illness a nd move f orward into life. AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) CONCLUSION Effectively closing the encounter depends on both your closing skills and the prepa ration you do earlier in the visit. By soliciting patients' complete agenda at the beginning, attending to verbal and nonverbal clues of patient concerns throughout the encounter, and rea ching a greement, the clinician sets the stage for successful closure. Whether completing a visit or terminating a relationship, the skills of closure will guide you through successf ul completion of your encounters. BEHAVIOR SKILLS CHECKLIST 1. Elicit questions and concerns before transitioning into closure. 2. Alert the patient to the fact that the encounter is ending. 3. Summarize and clarif y the plans. 4.

D epending on clinicians' skill a nd self-\u00adawareness, those emotions can lead to productive explora tion of important clinical issues, or they can threaten therapeutic relationships. This module will describe concepts and skills that help you to respond to patients' intense expressions of sadness, f ear, or anger in ways that not only promote pa tients' healing, but also enhance your own self-\u00adawareness and growth as a clinician. VIDEO (not shown in print-\u00adout text) The Patient's View VIDEO (not shown in print-\u00adout text) The Do ctor's ViewQuestio ns fo r Reflect ion: 1. In what circumstances are you awa re when a patient is feeling strong emotions? In wha t situations are you caught of f guard? 2. How do you respond to patients who get angry with you? 3. When patients demonstrate strong emotions, which of your reactions tend to help the situation resolve? Which tend to escalate discomfort in the room? 4. In your non-\u00admedical lif e, does fear, anger, or sadness tend to cause you the most discomfort? 5. How do you determine whether you need specia lty consultations with patients who are emotionally distressed? When do you consult your peers? Key Principles: 1. Strong emotions can originate in the pa tient or the clinician, or the strong emotions can derive from the interaction between clinicia n and patient. Identifying the origin of emotions promotes clear bounda ries and enhanced clinica l effectiveness. 2. Responding to emotions thoughtfully tends to strengthen the clinica l alliance and promote healing; responding reactively or def ensively tends to disrupt or weaken that alliance and diminish both patients' and clinicians' satisfaction. 3. Strong emotions in clinician-\u00adpatient interactions are neither good nor bad. They are a natural human consequence of life-\u00adchanging events. 4. Exploring clinicia ns' emotions that arise in the interview as well a s the ways that clinicians respond to patients' emotions promotes personal and prof essional growth. Learning go als: At the co nclusion o f this mo dule, yo u will be able to : Describe the eff ects (on patients and on clinicia ns) of clinicians' empathic responses to strong emotions, as well as the effects of ignoring strong emotions. Identify likely origins of strong emotions. Describe how clea r personal boundaries promote clinica l effectiveness and professiona l growth. Demonstrate ability to respond empathically to strong emotions. Describe situations tha t may require ref erral or medication as adjunctive responses to strong emotions.Identifying St rong Patient Emo tions We often notice strong emotions in patients, but sometimes are so ca ught up in an interaction that we fail to recognize or respond to patients' emotions (or our own emotions) until we look back on the interaction or notice the residual impact on ourselves. Sadness, Fear and Anger Although they manifest quite differently, the emotions of sadness, f ear, and anger a ll have their origin in the experience or a nticipation of loss. Clinician emot ions Exploring your own emotions that arise in patient care promotes your professional growth. Most of us are very sensitive to some emotions, and much less to others. You can become a more flexible and eff ective clinicia n by being more aware of your own \"hot buttons\" and \"blind spots.\" Making emo tions work fo r you Empathic responses acknowledge patients' emotions or experiences, and show your interest in understanding them. Sadness, Fear, and Anger The emotions of sadness, f ear, and anger all have their origin in the experience or a nticipation of loss. In sadness, the patient experiences directly the discrepancy between a desired and an actual state. In fear, the pa tient confronts the agent of an anticipated loss. In anger, the patient reacts to potential loss by warding of f a threat. Anger is sometimes called a secondary emotion, because underneath the anger may be f ound sadness about the loss. In the medical interview, each of these emotions ca n have their source either in the patient, the clinician, or in the interaction between them. We don't generally associate anger with loss, but when a ngry, you can unc over this relationship by asking yourself the question, \"What might this person (or situation) cause me to lose?\" What functio ns do these emo tions serve? All these emotions have evolved in humans and other species because they confer some survival advantage. Research in wild chimpanzees has demonstrated advanta ges to the capacity to read emotions as well a s disastrous social consequences of the inabili ty to do so. Simila rly, people have evolved the capacity to \"read\" others' emotions because to do so confers an advantage. Outside of medicine \"emotional intelligence\" (EQ) may correla te better with job and marital success than intelligence quotient (IQ). Research indicates that complex neurobiological mecha nisms and neuroendocrine a ctivation underlie the phenomenon of empathy. \"Mirror neurons\" that register observed behavior in the cortexhave been identified. These provide the opportunity to internally \"rehearse\" the observed experience of a nother person, even if the observer does not perf orm the action. (Similarly, dreamed a ctions a re suppressed while sleeping.) While the potential to experience another' s experience seems to exist, the degree to which clinical empathy depends on mirroring remain s aresea rch question. (See section below on the interview a s healing experience.) Speculating further on the biology of the emotions is beyond the purpose of this module, but what is abundantly clear is that emotions have effects both on the self and on others. Some neurohumoral ef fects such as preserving or mobilizing physiologic resources, may be beneficial, and others such as clinica l depression dysfunctional. And effects on other people such as engendering the desire to assist can similarly be helpf ul, while other effects such as provoking anger can be harmful. Awareness of emotions a nd the ability to recognize them in other people confers the power to react mindf ully rather than reflexively. Thoughtful responses are productive for the patient and satisfying for the clinicia n, whereas reflex reactions retard rapport and limit healing. Clinician Emo tions Exploring your own emotions that arise in treating patients promotes your professional growth. Most of us are very sensitive to some emotions, and less sensitive to others. You can be a more flexible and eff ective clinician by becoming more aware of your own blind spots and \"hot buttons\". Emotions are \"cont agious\" Clinicians may resona te with patients' a nger or sadness and thus feel the sa me emotion. Or a patient's emotion may evoke a different emotion in a clinician, e.g., patient sadness may induce clinician anger. Also, a clinician may experience an emotion when the patient is not manifesting any emotion. The ra nge of responses to patients is as rich as the diversity of human experience, upbringing, culture, and personality. While our own emotions may provide clues to what the patient is f eeling, there is nevertheles s a differential diagnosis of clinician emotion - just a s the emotions may have many sources in the pa tient, the same may be said of the clinicia n. These f actors combine to attune us differently to emotions - there is no \"correct\" or \"best\" response. Making emo tions wo rk for yo u Empathic responses acknowledge patients' emotions or experiences, and show your interest in understanding them. Your empathic respo nses are therapeutic, because feeling underst ood is healing. When yo u fail to respo nd, patient s may infer that yo u do not care or value t heir experiences. Your empathic respo nses help your patient s join with you t o explo re their sto ries o f illness mo re efficiently. If emotions a re unpleasant or if we lack confidence in our ability to respond to them, we may try to ignore or distance ourselves f rom them. Seeing the patient as the source of our discomfort can make a therapeutic alliance diff icult. Skillful exploration of patients' emotions, which enables you to understand their situations and increases your capacity for caring, is the main tool in overcoming barriers such as a lack of confidence or discomfort. Seeing the patient as suffering from the emotion rather than being the source of our own unpleasant f eeling rekindles a therapeutic instinct. Reminding ourselves that the patient' s behavior is separate from the patient as a person creates profess ional objectivity. Further, your exploration usually enhances patients' ca pacity f or healing, as well as their capacity for optimism and for taking ef fective action. For me, understanding the patient's experience is how I overcome the f eeling that the patient is a challenge sitting on the other side of the table. It helps me feel that the patient and I a re together on the same side of the table, with his uncomfortable experience on the other side. The main t herapeutic to ol is your empat hic respo nse to patients' stro ng emotions. Let's def ine empathy as most scholars do, as a cognitive awareness of another person's experience, state, or emotion. Your empathic responses communicate this understanding. The responses show your patients tha t you are aware of their experiences. Actively demonstrating your understanding builds trust and safety into the relationship. In turn, trust helps patients share more information, a nd cooperate better with pla ns and treatments. Data from many sources within medicine, across diverse cultures and in fields such a s psychology, education and the arts demonstrate that fa iling to respond to strong emotions in an empathic manner makes people f eel they are not valued, ignored, not understood or not cared f or by the listener. The interview itself can beco me a healing experience because being understo od is therapeut ic. You do not need to actually experience the emotion of the patient to imagine how the patient feels. And, to be sure, people debate about how much emotional connection between patients and clinicians is optima l. Too much detachment risks a loss of rapport; loss of boundaries risks a loss of therapeutic agency. My opinion and experience is that it is not necessary to feel what the patient is f eeling in order to be therapeutic. However, a s discussed above, when I do experience emotion in a n interview, I f ind it useful to become curious about why this is so (see \"Professional growth\", below). This module demonstrates application of empathy skills to situations in which emotions are strong. Because of the intensity of the feelings, these could be considered high stakes situa tions. Nevertheless, empathy skills are the same in simple situa tions a nd in emotionally intense ones. Many learners worry that the purpose of empathy skills and empathic responding is manipulative. The aim is, emphatically , not to maneuver the patient into another state or perspective desired by the clinician, no ma tter how benevolent the goal. Rather, the purpose is to become more transparent, to make a genuine clinical understanding more visible to the patient, to build alliance, safety, and trust. Just as a ny skill is initially awkwardly perf ormed (think of your first ski run, your f irst attempt a t the Moonlight Sonata, or your f irst souff l\u00e9!), skills become easier with practice, a nd in ma ny situations even automatic. Increasing the range of situations in which you can respond with empathy is not only possible, it is a process tha t is essential throughout your career, from student to seasoned clinician. The illustrations in these chapters are necessarily those of the author, albeit informed by the Kalamazoo consensus and other evidence-\u00adbased sources. They may feel foreign to you - your task is to find personal words that genuinely communicate your attempts to understand patients' experience. Wha tever your words, and however awkward or unskilled you feel, if you are genuine in your intention to understand, your a ttempt will be helpful. First, your empathic non-\u00adverbal cues (m14) will be apparent to patients, and secondly, if they misunderstand you are likely to see those signals and have a nother chance to clarif y your intent and express your caring. If your goal were to manipulate, the skills would be inflammatory; if your goal is to communicate genuine thoughts a nd feelings, no matter how awkwardly expressed, the patient is likely to be appreciative. Respo nding to Stro ng Emot ccomplishes all three f unctions of the medical interview: data gathering, relationship-\u00adbuilding, and collaborative pla nning f or diagnosis a nd treatment.In this section, I will briefly discuss: Respo nding to intense sadness Giving the patient control over whether and how to discuss the emotion will also give the patient some control of the emotion. Respo nding to intense anger Anger is a normal response to perceived threat but can be counter-\u00adproductive when it alienates those who might help. Respo nding to intense fear Medical events, such a s a severe motor vehicle accident or approaching the dreaded end of a lethal illness, can precipitate intense f ear. Although clinicia ns use judgment in deciding when a nd how to respond to emotions when they arise in the interview, choosing not to explore emotions that are strongly expressed will usually be destructive to the therapeutic rela tionship, since a strongly expressed em otion will be appa rent and can only be ignored by choice. Ignoring feelings communicates that the clinicia n does not care about the emotion or considers it not important or relevant to the interview. This greatly diminishes the therapeutic ef fectiveness of the clinician (Module 3). In reality, clinicia ns commonly disregard emotions, sometimes because they think they lack the skills to manage the interview, either in terms of time or emotions, and sometimes because they cannot shift their focus from the biologic a spects of the situation back to the person. Studies have shown that addressing emotions helps shorten the interview a nd build trust, in both surgical and primary care visits. I believe that the explanation for the time saving eff ects of the empathy skills lies in the patient's persistent at tempt to become known as a person, and to communicate important personal needs, values, concerns, and beliefs before proceeding to biomedical concerns. Skillful use of empathy skills allows the clinician to integrate caring for the person with caring f or biomedical concerns, a s she accomplihshes data gathering, relationship-\u00adbuilding, a nd therapeutic goals. Intense Sadness Extreme sadness may be non-\u00adv erbally apparent as the clinician enters the room - the patient may be crying, withdrawn, or staring at the f loor. The clinician cannot initially know whether the experience of loss relates to a health concern, a social issue, depression or something else. Giving the pat ient control o ver whether and ho w to discuss t he emot ion will also give the patient so me control o f the emotion. Thus it can be empowe ring for the clinician to simply notice the sadness with reflectio n. \"You seem sad (upset or down) today.\" Reflection As with all the emotions we will discuss in this chapter, some calibratio n may be necessary. For example, for a patient who is withdrawn, the statement a bove brings the emotion into the interview a nd signals that you intend to address it. However, for a patient who is sobbing, the emotio n is already present, and the statement above is too tame. Thus, inviting the patient to explain the emotion is a better approach. \"Can you tell me what is upsetting you?\" Some explanation will f ollow. When the clinician has some notion of the cause, validat ing thepatient is the critical next step. (Sometimes the skill of valida tion is called legitimation.) Validatio n demonstrates the clinicia n's understanding of the reason for the emotion. \"Losing your job when your husband has been out of work must be very upsetting.\" Validation \"It's terrible to lose a child. Anyone would be terribly distraught.\" Validation The empathy skills suppo rt and partnership off er some help or relief from suff ering. Suppo rt acknowledges a distressing circumstance. \"The last f ew months of your wife's illness have been really difficult.\" Support Partnership specifically offers the clinicia n's assistance in a distressing circumsta nce. \"Let's figure out a couple of options for how to help you f eel better, to see what choices fit you best.\"Partnership Lastly, respect for the patient's emotional strength can help bolster those resources. \"I'm impressed with how you've coped with such a devastating loss.\" Respect Because responding to emotions with empathic communication powerfully signals to the patient the clinician' s interest in staying in relationship even in the presence of strong emotions, we discuss this dynamic in many modules, a nd notably in M 6, on B uilding Relationship . The need for clarity during discussion of medica l topics sometimes distracts clinicians from responding to the patient's sadness or other emotions. The mnemonic PEARLS, representing Pa rtnership, Empathy, Apology (or Appreciation), Respect, Legitimation, and Support helps ma ny clinicians find words to respond in complex or stressf ul situations. Intense Sadness: o ther co nsideratio ns Depressio n Many (but by no means all) people who suf fer a signif icant loss or illness will develop clinical depression. Whenever strong sadness is present, the clinician should screen for the presence of major depression. In extreme sadness, the clinicia n should explore the patient' s capacity for self-\u00ad care (or intent f or self -\u00adharm) and access to a support system: f riends, relatives, faith, a nd other practitioners. Professional gro wth Self-\u00adawareness is critical not only for the self-\u00adcare and growth of the clinicia n but a lso to be maximally eff ective with the patient. How a clinician's own emotional state will be af fected by a distra ught patient will have been to some extent conditioned by the clinicians' formative lif e experiences as well as by similar previous clinical encounters. One common response would be pers onal sadness. The self -\u00adaware clinician will consider the possibility that his own sadness is a diagnostic clue to the presence of sadness or depression in the patient. [see Clinician Emotions ].Intense Anger Anger is a normal response to perceived threat but can be counter-\u00adproductive when it alienates those who might help. Further, if clinicians respond with defensive or retaliatory statements or questions, patients' anger may actually increase. Remember this key factor: you can express your understanding without agreeing with patients. Patients may express a nger toward clinicians for many reasons, including: medical errors, by the clinician or any part of the medical team clinicians' appea ring uncaring, arro gant, or judgment al sometimes the patient is f earful or a ngry abo ut his medical situat ion but directs that anger toward the medical team Click the picture above to see a movie portraying po or communication with a n angry patient.Click the picture above to see a movie portraying better communication with an angry patient. Most clinicians find it dif ficult to try to understand and to express empathy with patients by whom we feel attacked, but the same skills useful in other situations are equally useful here. As with sadness, stating your empathy with angry patients may require calibration. For example, when the patient is \"simmering\" with a nger but doesn't f eel tha t it's appropriate to reveal the anger, reflectio n will help bring the upset into the interview, where it can be addressed: \"You seem angry. Have I done something to upset you?\" Reflection However, the sa me statement would seem foolish, sarcastic, or belittling to a patient who is yelling at the clinicia n. Here, there is no need to bring the emotion into the open, since it is already present. Validatio n would be more appropriate: \"Anyone would be upset af ter being kept wa iting in a cold room dressed in a flimsy gown.\"Validation Clinicians are often reluctant to validat e (or legitimize) a patient's anger f or fear of \"adding fuel to the fire.\" B ut especia lly because not feeling heard often arouses patients' anger, legitimizing (validating) the feeling is helpf ul, not harmful. The \"I can understand that you. . . .\" language enables a clinician to validat e a patient while no t necessarily agreeing with the pa tient: \"I can understand that you would be upset with me for not prescribing the Vicodin\u00ae, when tha t's the main reason you ca me in today.\"ValidationYOU DON'T HAVE TO AGREE TO EXPRESS UNDERSTANDING! It is still possible to suppo rt a patient who is a ngry: \"It's difficult to care so much and feel that you can't control what happens.\" Support \"Let's see if there's another way I can help address your concerns; or perhaps others on the health care tea m can a ssist us.\"Partnership When the disagreement transpires within acceptable bounds, respecting the au tonomy of the patient can de-\u00adescalate anger: \"Even though I'd pref er that you agree with the team' s recommendation, I respect that you need to advise your mother of what you consider to be in her best interest.\"Respect One of the challenges of dealing with intense anger is balancing empathy with enough \"detachment\" to remain professiona l. The patient's a nger may or may not be directly towards us persona lly, but feeling personally attacked can make us defensive. And acting defensive worsens the situation, because it escalates ra ther than de-\u00adescalates the emotion. Sometimes it helps to remind ourselves that although patients' anger may be directed at us, its origin may lie in the patient's circumstances. In other words we're not responsible for the patient's a nger or for \"fixing\" it. However, we do help patients when we take the time to become mindful of their pa in or loss and genuinely attempt to make an empathic statement despite feeling attacked. AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) Intense Anger: o ther co nsideratio ns Boundaries and safety There a re times when it is appropriate to place boundaries on the pa tient's anger, when you would choose not to empathize, such a s when the patient is so upset that he cannot listen, when the patient has lost control, or when he threatens the safety of those around him. The best way to place limits on the patient is to describe the conditions in which you are willing to continue to engage him. This gives the patient the choice of whether to de-\u00adescalate the confrontation and continue to be heeded or, alternat ively, to lose his audience and certain other freedoms: \"I'm willing to continue this conversation so long a s you exhibit the same respect towards me tha t I am g iving you.\" If disregarded, your own limit-\u00adsetting should escalate: \"If you continue to disrupt our a bility to conduct care safely in this clinic, I will need to call Security.\" If the patient continues to be disruptive, it's best not to continue to engage him. Doing so may indeed \"f uel the fire.\" In such situations, it is appropria te to leave the room, to hang up the telephone, or to call Security. Your own saf ety takes precedence over being thera peutic. Your own gut feeling a bout personal safety is generally relia ble, and being attuned to a sense of danger is but another aspect of self -\u00ad awareness.Exhibitions of extreme anger a re unusual and may signal other feelings or diagnoses. For example, intense a nger may be a way of insulating oneself from intense f ear, such a s that presented by a lethal diagnosis or a threat to one's child. Anger that might have been more moderately expressed can be dis-\u00adinhibited by alcohol a nd other drugs. Personality disorders and delusional thinking can manifest as extreme anger, so such demonstrations should prompt consideration of substance abuse, sociopathy or schizophrenia . Professional gro wth Being the target of intense anger is a lways upsetting, a nd you are likely to feel shaken. Take a few moments to center yourself after such an encounter before moving on to other tasks and reflect on the experience, which may offer opportunities for growth. You could ask yourself, or discuss this with a trusted colleague: \"What was going on here at a deeper level tha n what the confrontation was about?\" \"What might I have said or done that could have de-\u00adescalated the situa tion?\" \"Was there anything I did that increased the patient' s anger; or did I set it of f in some way?\" Intense Fear Medical events such as a motor vehicle accident or a worsening clinica l situation precipitate intense f ear. You can best assist patients who experience intense fear by helping them bring the fears into the interview where you can listen and show your understanding. We need to resist invoking f alse reassurance in order to minimize the patient' s or our own discomfort. When a patient's fear is well-\u00adf ounded, fa lse reassurance jeopardizes trust and undermines the therapeutic alliance. That alliance is what provides the leverage f or supporting the patient. On the other hand, you should never diminish hope. Even when the most dire outcome, death, is certa in, hope may be available in the manner or management of dying, in spiritual domains, and in the people and accomplishments left behind. Starting with what you observe ma y objectify an emotion of which the patient was consciously unaware: \"You seem apprehensive.\" Reflection Then explore the cause: you most about this illness? operation? dying?\" \"What help would you like in order to deal with [whatever the patient names]?\" \"What worri es you most about leaving your [significant other] behind?\" \"Have you spoken to her of your concerns? Are there ways you could provide f or her?\" Many of the concerns patients will name can be addressed: If a patient f ears uncontrolled pain, you can reassure her of the effectiveness of and access to medication. If the patient has spiritual concerns, you can consult appropriate pasto ral services. Sometimes simply naming t he fear or hearing that particular concerns a re norma l rather than extraordinary, diminishes fear. Since a lack of control over future events drives the intensity of f ear, taking any po sitive action may confer a sense of control. The interview itself can offer several ways of helping the patient. Commonly, a sense of isolation,of having to face the unknown alone, intensif ies fear. Feeling unattra ctive or tainted by illness can increase a sense of alienation. Sometimes the patient's specific f ears are realistic and terrif ying, such as the new diagnosis of a lethal disease. In these situations, the expression \"I wish it were different\" can support the patient by communicating caring, understanding and sharing the patient's perspective. Knowing that many others have been in the same position can help: \"The experience of chemot herapy is scary for patients. They commonly think that others fear being around them.\" Validation \"You're dealing with a lot right now.\" Support \"And you're doing very well with it.\" Respect You can alleviate that sense of isolation by off ering to refer the patient to a counselor, to a support group, or simply by proffering your own constant presence: \"Whatever struggles you'll f ace with this illness, we' ll go through them together.\" Partnership AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) Intense ther co nsiderations Other reso urces: Some patients' f ear becomes a paralyzing terror, preventing them f rom making constructive steps. Anxiety is a psychobiologic consequence of fear. While a nxiety can mobilize a patient to prevent or mitigate a feared event, s evere anxiety may require psychiatric consultation or medication. If appropriate, a benzodiazepine can give the patient relief and a sense of control.(m25) Remember to screen for alcohol or other substance abuse before you offer this option. Professional gro wth You confront your own existential fears through your patients' suffering and death. Many clinicians in certain specialties encounter these challenging issues every day. You a lso bump up against your own limitations, which can precipitate a professional crisis. Reflecting upon these issues with colleagues lessens f eelings of isolation, guilt, inadequacy and uncertainty which a ll caring professiona ls live with, and bringing fears into the open prevents burnout.(m4) No one is immune to these experiences-\u00ad-\u00adremember to share feelings with your colleagues and your team; their listening will help you at the same time it helps them. CONCLUSIONS Because patients regularly conf ront both real and apparent life-\u00adchanging medical events, clinicians will regularly encounter their patients' and their own strong emotions. These emotions are neither good nor bad - they are simply fa cts, like the weather. And like the wea ther, they will change as circumstances evolve. Both patients and clinicians can become stuck in emotions, and overwhelmed by their force. Atthese times we must maintain our own professional equilibrium and use the skills tha t we have practiced in less challenging circumsta nces, particularly those empathy skills tha t communicate interest in the patient as a person. The intensity of these moments ca n generate proportionally strong and rewarding relationships with patients. Simila rly, such moments not only create prof essiona l challenges, they also engender personal and professiona l growth.

In conversa tions with patients, the key nonverbal information is whether they appea r to feel \"safe\" or \"not saf e\" 6. Leading and matching behaviors are natural and usually unconscious 7. The most important nonverbal skill is building nonverbal rapport Learning go als: At the co nclusion o f this mo dule, yo u will be able to : Describe four cat egories o f nonverbal co mmunicat ion Describe four patt erns o f nonverbal behavio r seen in medical settings Describe four types o f pro xemics (shaping space) that foster rapport Discern and name nonverbal behaviors in video clips in this module Demonstrate abilit y to match and lead during conversation INTRODUCTION Let's define \"no nverbal co mmunicat ion\" as all the behaviora l signals that go on between interacting individua ls, exclusive of the verbal content (1 ). When two or more of us are together, we human beings cannot fail to communicate at a ll times, even when we are silent. The importance o f nonverbal co mmunicat ion Nonverbal communications are powerful and useful. The \"f irst impressions\" that we clinicians make of patients, and that patients make of us are based almost entirely on nonverba lly communicated information. Rapport Rapport simply means \"I am with you,\" and is the nonverbal structure of empathy Nonverbal behavio r and feelings Involuntary nonverbal communication more accura tely ref lects the feeling state of a person than does a verbal messa ge. Monitoring the interview Tracking nonverbal communications has special utility when you are puzzled about someaspect of your relationship with a patient. The importance o f nonverbal co mmunicat ion Nonverbal co mmunicat ions are po werful and useful. The \"first impressions\" that we clinicians make of patients, and that patients make of us are based almost entirely on nonverbally communicated information. All of us are sending and receiving nonverba l messages all the time, a t varying levels of sublimina l and conscious awareness. Some of us naturally monit or the messages. All of us can learn to attend to them. Experts' estimates in the literature range widely, but on avera ge, they teach us that 80% of all communication is nonverbal and involuntary, while 20% is verbal and under our conscious control. Important information -\u00ad that cannot be hidden -\u00ad is being exchanged nonverbally at all times from patient to clinician, and from clinician to patient. For both parties, the nonverba l channel carries the meaning of the message while the verbal channel carries the more concrete co ntent of the messa ge. There is much to be gained by tuning in to these nonverbal messages.(2 ) This takes some practice, but once you become attentive and skillful, obtaining this valuable information takes no extra time. Evidence shows that nonverbal communication has signif icant influence on the important outcomes of patient satisfaction, adherence to medical advice, a nd even clinical response to treatments. (3,4) Rappo rt Rapport simply means \"I am with you,\" a nd is the nonverbal structure of empa thy. Rapport is sensed almost entirely nonverbally. Experienced clinicians know that their work with patients is more eff icient and more effective when both parties are in good rapport. In that harmonious state, historica l information can be ga thered more fully and accurately, therapeutic plans can be more easily ne gotiated, a clinician's advice is more apt to be followed, and both people are more satisfied with the exchange. Fortunately f or clinicians and patients, good rapport can almost always be initiated easily if we pay conscious attention to our nonverbal messages. Nonverbal behavio r and feelings Involuntary nonverbal communication more accura tely reflects the feeling state of a person than does a verbal messa ge. The nonverbal components of communication help give meaning to our spoken words a nd help us interpret how our words have been received. The full meaning of a communication can be f ound in the respo nse a messa ge evokes in the receiver (e.g., the patient). The patient's verbal and nonverbal responses may show you that s/he has interpreted your message exactly as you had hoped, or your patient' s responses may surprise you by indicating that s/he has interpreted the message in a way other than wha t you intended to communicate. Getting a response different from the one you expected does not mean that your communication was bad. It just means it did not do the job you wa nted it to do. You have not yet ma de your message clear. You may need to be flexible and find another approach - perhaps verbally and nonverbally - in order tocommunicate ef fectively. Involuntary nonverbal communication more accura tely reflects the feeling state of a person than does a verbal message. In other words, it' s hard to be dishonest nonverbally. If you perceive a mixed message from a patient, the nonverbal channel sends the truer messa ge. Similarly, if a patient perceives a mixed message from his/her clinician, s/he is likely to put more credence in the clinician' s nonver bal messa ge. For example, if a clinician asks a question of a patient while maintaining eye contact, then turns to the paper or electronic medical record before the patient has begun to respond, it is quite possible that the patient will interpret the nonverbal message of breaking eye contact to mean that the clinician is not genuinely interested in the patient's response to the question. The clinicia n may f eel confident that s/he can look at the chart a nd listen to the response at the same time - but the patient may not share that perspective. It is certa inly not necessary to be looking at the patient throughout his/her entire response, but it is helpful to support the beginning of the response with continued visual connection, and you should maintain that connection if the patient is expressing strong a ffect. Monitoring the interview Tracking nonverbal communications has special utility when you are puzzled about some aspect of your relationship with a patient. Paying attention to the nonverbal communications that are flowing between clinician and patient allows either party to track the process of how the interaction is going f or them. If things are not going well, the attentive clinicia n has a choice. S/he can bring the apparent diff iculty into the \"open\" in terms of conscious, verbal discussion, or s/he can try to make more subtle shifts to improve nonverbal ra pport. We will pay much more attention to the topic of building nonverbal rapport later in this module. All behavior is communica ting something, and all behavior is adaptive. A patient's behavior does not occur in a vacuum, but ra ther is a n adaptive response to his/her unique world view. We may not be able to recognize immediately the adaptive purpose of a particular behavior, especially if it is self-\u00addestructive. However, recognizing tha t every behavior has some kind of adaptive purpose may allow us to stay on the \"same side of the fence\" with the pa tient, rather than becoming judgmenta l and pulling away. This stance also a llows the crea tion of a therapeutic alliance that can help the patient change the behavior. FOUR CATEGORIES OF NONVERBAL COMMUNICATION The four categories of nonverbal communica tion are kinesics (movement), proxemics (shaping space), paralanguage (pitch, tone, volume), and auto nomic (physiologic changes from the autonomic nervous system). Kinesics refers to behaviors that involve movement, such as faci al expressions, eye gaze, levels of body tension, gestures a nd fidgeting, how and where we touch ea ch other, a nd body position (or posture). These are typically nonverbal behaviors over which we have some degree of voluntary control.(5 ) Proxemics refers to how the space is sha ped between interacting individuals, and includes vertical height differences, interpersonal distance, angles of facing, and physical barriers such as charts, computers, desks, and exam ta bles. Paralanguage includes a ll the qualities of the voice: tonality, rate, rhythm, volume, a nd emphasis.(6 ) Not only can we use these qua lities to deliver quite different messages with thesame words: I am ordering these tests; vs. I am ordering these tests; vs. I am ordering these tests - but we each have our own unique voiceprint, much like our fingerprint, that often lets others identify us immediately when we phone, even before we tell them who it is that is calling. A warm and inviting voice - on the phone or in the of fice -\u00ad can create relaxa tion and comf ort in a patient, and help them more rea dily talk about their prima ry concern.(7 ) Attending to paralanguage is also very helpf ul in telephone medicine where the only nonverbal cues a re in the auditory domain. Autonomic changes are truly involuntary nonverbal signals that reflect alterations in a person's internal sta te. Facial color can shift from neutral to flushed or blanched. The conjunctivae can begin to glisten as an early sign of tearing. You can see sweating or feel it in a handshake. You can notice whether a person is breathing calmly, sighing, or taking in a deep, startled breath. Pupil size dila tion and constriction can be observed if the iris is a light color. Changes in these autonomically controlled signals usually ref lect strong f eelings, worthy of your notice. These signals may provide you with clues and cues to the patient's significant health concerns and/or information a bout how the patient is f eeling a bout you and what you just did or said. FOUR GENERAL PATTERNS OF NONVERBAL RESPONSE IN CLINICAL SETTINGS Since it is possible to observe hundreds of bits of nonverbal data , developing a cognitive framework to sort the data and identify patterns of behavior is a usef ul learning strategy. Four patterns a re particularly important to detect. Safe pattern In saf ety, the predominant f eature is that the body is engaged, relaxed, and in an open posture. Fight pat tern In \"fight,\" the predominant stance is one of enga gement, and of attack or retaliation a s a defense to feeling unsafe. Flight pat tern \"Flight\" is chara cterized by increased body tension, as in \"fight\", but disenga gement, rather patt ern In \"conserva tion-\u00adwithdrawal,\" the person is overwhelmed with excessive input a nd is withdrawn, unable to mount a response. Some exceptio ns to the patt erns Patterns are often mixed rather than occurring in \"pure culture.\" Also, nonverbal communication differs across cultures, with the major exception that \"saf e\" and \"not safe\" seem to be universal patterns. Safet y In the context of a doctor-\u00adpatient visit, t he mo st impo rtant dist inction t hat nonverbal signals can help yo u make is whether the pat ient appears to feel \"safe\" o r \"no t safe.\" \"Safe\" is relaxed or neutral, compared to \"unsafe\" which is activated (f ight or flight) orwithdrawn (conserva tion-\u00adwithdrawal). Safety is a basic human need, and is about self -\u00adprotection a nd self-\u00adpreservation. When we humans feel safe, our ca techolamine levels are relatively low. We can hear wha t is being said to us. Our brains are able to absorb a broad range of information, process the information, and produce new thoughts a nd questions. When both patient and doctor f eel saf e, they are in the best state to accomplish product ive work. In other words, the patient needs to feel sa fe enough to revea l real concerns, fears, and vulnerabilities to their clinician; and then be psychologically ava ilable to hear, see and react to the doctor's responses. The clinician needs to feel safe enough and \"present\" enough (not fearful, distracted, or anxious) to hear the patient's story medically and psychosocially, and then to respond wit h all of his/her medical and huma n insight. If safety is not present for the patient, s/he will reveal \"not safe\" behaviors which are most commonly those of \"fight\" or \"flight.\" A less common response is \"conservat ) ts. It is therefore possible for you to read quickly the patterns of each response. We'll look at each these pat terns in static form on the next several pages, and then in action on the video clips. Safe pattern In saf ety, the predominant f eature is that the body is engaged, relaxed, and in a n open posture. People who f eel saf e show reduced body tension, reduced interpersonal distance, and relaxed facial muscles. Arms and legs are relaxed as well, and typically uncrossed. There is variation in gestures and in voice tones, as the sense of safety gives rise to freer expression. Facial color is neutral and other autonomic signals are generally \"quiet.\" This person appears relaxed in f ace and posture, as if about to speak, and her crossed legs may or may not be an important gesture at this time. Fight pat tern In \"fight,\" the predominant stance is one of engagement , and of a ttack or reta liation as a defense to feeling unsafe. In full expression, it looks like a \"raging bull.\" Typical nonverbal signals of fight include heightened body tension, leaning forward with jutting jaw, clenched f ists, narrowing of the inner eye brows, flaring of the nostrils, and tensing of the mouth. Voice volume typically increases and becomes more staccato, and breathing is deeper. The face may flush.This person's posture is forward, her jaw juts out tensely, and her nostrils may be flared. Her posture shows tension in arms, legs and right hand is clenched on her knee. Her f ace may be flushed. This person's jaw juts out and her entire face is tense, with f lared nostrils and flushed face. Flight pat tern \"Flight\" is characterized by increased body tension, as in \"fight\", but shows disengagement , rather than enga gement. Characteristics of the flight pattern are easy to remember because everything flees nonverbally: the person may pull back or tuck the chin, turn the head and avert the eyes; barriers of crossed arms a nd legs may go up; the voice volume diminishes and speech may be strained or hesitant; color ma y blanch, a nd breathing ma y be f aster, more shallow, or held.This person is leaning a way from the desk, her arms a re crossed, her chin is tucked in and her face more relaxed than tense. Conservatio n-\u00adwit hdrawal patt ern In \"conservatio n-\u00adwit hdrawal,\" the person is overwhelmed with excessive input a nd unable to mount a response. The nonverbal cues are disengagement and relative immobility. The still body is slumped with sagging face and limbs; the voice is very so ft and speech is hesitant when present; color is more neutral, neither f lushed nor blanched; barriers are down. This pattern is well known to experienced clinicians as the look of a patient with marked depression, and the look of someone who is emotionally and physiologically overwhelmed in an intensive care unit. This person is slumped down with slack arms; her eyes are closed or looking very downward. Some exceptio ns to the patt erns Patterns are o ften mixed rather than occurring in \"pure culture.\" \"Safe\" and \"no t safe\" seem to be universal patterns across cultures, while other nonverbal communication differs in diverse cultures. Similarly, f acial expressions of fear, anger, disgust, grief, surprise a nd joy se em to be consistent across diverse cultures. (9 ) Having looked at all f our behavior patterns, we need to qualify these general forms by noting tha t it is important to read the overall pat tern of nonverbal responses rather than to rely on any one signal. Patients may cross their arms because the room is cold, or because there are no arms on the chair - yet their bodies remains quite rela xed and engaged and their voices are melodious, indicating overall saf ety in the encounter. You may see a f lushed face and hear a loud voice as apatient describes being angry with someone else in his/her life, while s/he is actually feeling saf e enough with you to share the story. It is also important to note that you will frequently see mixed responses, such as fight and flight, especia lly in patients who are a ngry with us but are af raid to jeopardize the relationship by telling us. Such a patient might show us an angry f ace but his body might be pulling away and his arms might be crossed. Another caveat is that there is important cultural va riation of some nonverbal behaviors, with different significance a ttached to gestures, eye gaze a nd eye contact, and to norms about interpersonal distance and touch. Eye contact, for example, is a behavior that is generally apprecia ted as a sign of engagement and attentiveness in cultures of Western European origin, while sustained eye contact is viewed a s rude and disrespectful in Asia n cultures of Chinese derivation.(10 ) Being ready to have conversations with our patients that help us explore and learn from them -\u00ad when we sense misunderstanding of some behavior -\u00ad is key to good relationship-\u00ad building across cultural dif ferences. ( m 15) BUILDING NONVERBAL RAPPORT Rapport simply means \"I am with you,\" and is the nonverbal structure of empathy. Some resea rchers have ca lled it \"interactional synchrony.\" We think build ing nonverbal rapport is the single most important nonverbal skill. We can create or deepen rapport by matching and leading patients' nonverbal behaviors. Building rapport helps crea te the form or vessel in which to hold the therapeutic clinician-\u00adpatient relationship. It consists of two pa rts: matching and leading. Matching Matching is the process of mirroring a spects of the other person' s behaviors, in such a way as to acknowledge a nd reflect the state they are in. Leading Leading is the utilization of the interactional synchrony that has been set up by ma tching. Video Clip Click the link abo ve to play a video clip to hone your observatio nal skills Matching Matching is the process of mirroring a spects of another person's behaviors. The patient who is \"matched\" usually f eels that his emotional state is acknowledged and understood by the clinician. When matching, you join patients in tha t state. You ca n match anything you notice: f acial expression, voice volume and rate, b ody posture and gestures. As you begin to create synchrony with the other person, you quite literally begin to enter their world nonverbally. Patients unconsciously recognize this nonverbal acknowledgement, although consciously they usually just report a sense of being \"understood.\" Matching is the nonverba l equiva lent of the verbal empathy skills of \"naming an emotion,\" \"mirroring\" or \"reflection,\" and nonverbal matching is empathy in action rather than in words. The a lliance-\u00adbuilding generated by the nonverba l signals is at least aspowerful as words that express empathy, and often builds even more trust and safety. Strive to be graceful a nd respectful in your matching, and to match only enough so that what you are doing does not come into the patient' s conscious awa reness. Otherwise, the pa tient will f eel mocked rather than supported. We humans often slide into matching each other completely unconsciously. Turn off the sound sometime when you are watching a live television broadca st. You can easily see the spontaneous postural matching of cha racters who are in rapport - and the postural mis-\u00admatching of individuals who are out of rapport. Leading Leading is the utilization of the interactional synchrony that has been set up by ma tching. Like dancers, two people in rapport are motiva ted to stay that way. Therefore, a leading motion by one person of a pair will quite likely invite a reciproca l respon se in the other person. For example, if the patient across from you appears to be feeling \"not safe\" -\u00ad sitting upright with arms crossed -\u00ad and you choose to mirror this subtly in your own posture by sitting more upright, the patient may feel met and more understood. When you have matched this posture for a few moments, you can begin to lean in a bit more toward the patient and notice whether the patient follows. With practice, if you discover that your patient appears \"not safe,\" you can match an aspect of her behavior and try to lead her to \"safe\" -\u00ad the state in which mutual understanding can more easily be achieved. As you are introduced to the concepts of leading and matching, you ma y worry that we are suggesting that you become duplicitous or manipulative and \"trick\" patients in some way. We emphasize that we are asking you to become conscious of leading and matching activities and skills that are entirely natural but usually unconscious (as in dancing). Using these skills will improve your ability to serve your patients more f ully and directly. We understand learning these skills to be the same as learning new verbal communication skills, in order to inform and guide patients more eff ective ly. As discussed in modules 6 and 13, building and maintaining rapport is an essential aspect of your ability to effectively engage patients in collaborative partnerships that promote healing a nd health. Videos to practice yo ur observatio nal skills Example 1: View this video clip to practice your observatio nal skillsQuiz Questio n: Do you think t he patient has more o n her mind t hat she wo uld have liked to have said? What specific nonverbal beha viors did the doctor engage in that discouraged the patient from bringing up her concerns? Click the hyperlinks that apply -\u00ad and receive f eedback: Answer 1: Their relative postures. Answer 2: The clinician' s voice tone and ra te of speech. Answer 3: The clinician's visual attention to the patient. Example 2: Now view the co ntinuation of this interactio n to see what happens next Discussion:Note that the clinician's eye contact is now congruent with her verbal and other nonverbal messa ges, and the patient feels sa fe enough to overcome her initial nonverbal disengagement and proceed to speak about her additional concern. The course of the visit looks like it's going to be diff erent f rom the prior example. The patient's disclosure may extend the length of the visit. However, the clinician now has the option of prioritizing the agenda for the visit so as to include discussion of the additional concern without lengthening the visit. If the concern is not noted by the clinician, it might become a \"doorknob\" concern that lengthens the ending of the visit, or leaves the patient very unsatisfied. (See D ocCom module 07: \"open the discussion\") SHAPING SPACE FOSTERS RAPPORT You can use severa l components of proxemics to foster rapport and saf ety in the doctor-\u00ad patient relationship. Setting the stage relates to welcoming the patient to the medical encounter. Vertical Height Differences relate to importa nt power differentials in clinical encounters. Interperso nal Distances (the ho rizontal space bet ween us) relates to \"ownership\" of the territory of the encounter. Angles o f Facing relate to alliance in the relationship.Physical Barriers relate to feelings of protection or exclusion.(11 ) Setting the stage Every bit of the outside and inside of your off ices and hospitals can give a message of invitation or dis-\u00adinvitation. You can a rrange space to encourage access and comfort - which, in turn, helps both pa tient and doctor to relax, and feel safe. How a clinician arranges and uses the spaces of his/her waiting room, consultation rooms, a nd exam rooms has significant influences on the experiences people will have in those rooms. If you haven't already toured your office spaces pretending to be a patient, we highly recommend this exercise. Sit in all the chairs in which your patients may sit. Lie down on the exam tables. Try on an exam gown. Take a look at whether desks, tables, computers and book shelves create spaces in which you feel comfortable f rom the patient' s perspective. A re any of those pieces of furniture forming barriers that separate patient and doctor in ways that do not support eff ective exchanges? Does the art on the walls reflect your taste? Is it likely to appeal to the ma jority of your patients? Do you provide reading materia l that is apt to be useful and/or appealing to the majority of your patients? And does the literacy level of the rea ding material span t he literacy range of your patients? Vertical Height Differences You can minimize the nega tive effects of power differences by minimizing dif ferences in vertical position. Vertical height differences can quickly create or reinf orce f eelings a bout power a nd control. Add to this the facts that patients often feel vulnerable when meeting a new clinician, and f earful if they suspect the possibility of a se rious illness. B e willing to match a patient's eye level, or even to seat yourself so your eyes are lower than the patient's. This will nonverbally offer your support and the reassurance that you are there to be helpful, not controlling. Example 1: Check o ut the video on the left. How do you think the vertical posture of the clinician influences the patient's communication? Discussion: In this video the patient does not say anything. The clinician seems rushed, a nd her nonverbal behavior could be interpreted as \"I a m in charge, and I have important business elsewhere.\"Example 2: Check o ut the other video on the left. How do you think the change in vertical height influences the patient's communication? Discussion: The patient seems to have f ound a voice, perhaps because the clinician has sat down and remained fully attentive. How do you think the change in posture influences the clinicia n's communication? We cannot know if the clinician' s initial intent in sitting down was to go more slowly, or if sitting allowed her to go more slowly, but she certainly lea ves more space f or the patient to a sk questions. We must sometimes talk with patients who a re lying in bed - whether a hospital bed, an emergency room stretcher, or the patient's bed at home. How we place ourselves in relation to supine patients can greatly af fect both our comfort and theirs. This in turn will affect the ease with which our verbal exchange can occur. Towering over someone creates nonverbal hiera rchy that discourages pa tients f rom asking questions and voicing concerns. It is always preferable to sit down when speaking to a patient in a bed. Sitting down also conveys to the patient a sense that you have the time to listen. It is also pref erable to sit on a chair, rather than on a patient's bed, since sitting on the bed may \"crowd\" some patients uncomfortably and convey disrespect to others. Interperso nal Distances (the ho rizont al space between us) Adjust your dista nce from the patient according to signals of safety. A third wa y to work with spatial relationships is through interpersonal distance. If you are too close during an interview, the patient will f eel tha t his space has been encroached upon , and is likely to behave in wa ys intended to restore the proper distance - such a s looking or turning away, crossing arms and legs to put up a \"frontal barrier,\" or flushing. Being too far away discoura ges true engagement, and may convey a sense of disinterest to the pa tient. Example: Check o ut the video on the left. Note what signs of flight indicate that the clinician is too close for this patient's comfort. Discussion:In this video clip the patient attempts to move back in his chair and crosses his arms. He does not speak during a pause in which he would likely offer more data, a question or a comment if he felt safe. Angles o f Facing Adjust the angle at which you f ace your patient so as to emphasize collabora tion; move more towards a side-\u00adby-\u00adside position rather than opposite each other. The fourth component of shaping space is angles of facing. Consider that opponents \"f ace off\" against each other. Colleague s or partners tackle challenges together \"shoulder-\u00adto-\u00adshoulder,\" or \"side-\u00adby-\u00adside.\" When you are examining information with a patient, e.g., laboratory results, you can create a greater sense of collaboration by sitting more side by side than opposite each other. The lab results can be positioned in front you both, rather tha n being \"the problem\" in between you. Sitting on a chair or stool on rollers can be very helpf ul in joining spatially with your patient when you feel that is a ppropriate. Imagine a different set of circumstances, for example, when you need to recommend a life-\u00adstyle change that is not what your patient wants to hear. You disagree. If you are seated directly opposite each other, you and your patient may experience the difference as more of a confronta tion than is a ctually intended . Once you are awa re of this sense of confronta tion rather than collaboration, you can begin to diffuse it by slowly changing the angle at which you are facing each other. Just a slight angulation can begin to ease the tension. Moving to an even more side-\u00ad by-\u00adside position can generate f eelings of support and collabora tion, in spite of the disagreement. Physical Barriers Show your interest in staying in connection by adjusting your position with regard to potential barriers. The fif th component of space we'll exa mine is that of physical barriers. These can be crossed arms and legs, a desk, a chart, a computer, an exam table or any other piece of f urniture or equipment. How can we work with them? We can go around them, work a round them, move them out of the way, comment on them if they are f ixed, and do a bsolutely nothing about them if the barrier proves useful to the patient and the doctor. The key is our awareness of them, and our ef forts to stay connected with our patient. Example 1: Check o ut the video on the left. How does the barrier of the computer on the clinicia n's desk effect the communication in this movie?Discussion: The clinician and the patient have trouble making eye contact. The clinician seems to be preoccupied with the keyboard. The patient, without eye conta ct, seems distracted and not attentive to the clinician. He offers short responses af ter her verbal questions, but does not expand his story or relate to the clinician during her silences. Example 2: Check o ut the other video on the left. How does the clinicia n's noting the barrier of the computer and aligning side by side with her patient eff ect the communication here? Discussion: Both clinicia n and patient seem attentive to each other in spite of the computer. The conversation f lows, with voice modula tion and body movements that indicate relaxa tion and engagement. AVOID MIXED MESSAGES Create saf ety by assuring congruence of your verbal and nonverbal communications, and attend to any non-\u00adcongruent communications from your patients to you. We'll now put several of your nonverbal skills together to help you work with your patients in ways that ca n literally \"save the day,\" save the relationship, and save importa nt outcomes of visits - by bringing your a ttention to the mixed messages that so often flow between patients and doctors. \"Congruent\" communications demonstrate a synchrony between the verbal and nonverbal behaviors. The words and the behaviors that go with the words send the same signals to the other person. \"Non-\u00adcongruent\" or mixed messages occur when the words a nd the nonverbal behaviors do not agree. This happens, typically, when a person f eels conflicted a bout expressing feelings directly. This conflict arises when people do not feel safe enough to say how it really is between them. B oth patients and doctors send mixed messages. For ea ch party, the nonverbal component of the message more truly reflects the speaker's feelings in the moment. When you wonder out loud why your patient looks \"worried\" and says she is \"fine,\" you are addressing the non-\u00adcongruent verbal and nonverbal signals -\u00ad the mixed message. This usually helps the patient feel safe enough to convert an incongruent \"f ine\" to a congruent \"well, actually I was ...\" You express interest and concern when you notice patients' non-\u00adcongruent messages. Your willingness to explore them enhances rapport, cooperation, collaboration and facilitates healing. A second common scenario is a patients' reluctance to take me dicine or undergo some test or treatment. This might be addressed by \"va lidating\" or \"legitimizing\" the patient's non-\u00adcongruent expressions by saying, \"Many pa tients about to take a new medication have concerns about it, such as cost, side effects, working it into their da ily schedule . . ..\" Perhaps the most common non-\u00adcongruent messa ge from clinician to patient is around reassurance. The clinician says, \"you'll be f ine,\" and has an expression of sadness or withdrawal. If the patient feels safe enough to inquire about the non-\u00adcongruent message just sent by you, you have the opportunity to strengthen your relationship even further. Additionally, patients who experience your congruence are far more likely to cooperate, to adhere to plans and to give you as much information and help as they can. REVIEW Let's start by assessing the rapport between doctor and patient in the next short video clip. Example 1: Click on the picture on the left and check out the first 15 seconds of a short video. Are patient and clinician in rapport? What clues do you find convincing? Discussion: Their smiles match. Their voice tones match. Their postures demonstra te equally relaxed body tension and ease of motion. The desk is not a barrier. Their eye contact suggests engagement. Example 2 Watch the complete movie now. This pair was in such good rapport just moments ago. What happened? Discussion: This clinician is clear about her concern f or this patient because of the f amily history of breast cancer. However, she has not effectively conveyed her concern in any way that will motivate the patient to obtain the mammogra m. The clinician's break in eye contact with the patient as she a ttends to the paperwork causes the clinician to miss the initial a nd dramatic turning away by the patient. Then, a s the clinician delivers the paperwork to the patient, she does not react to the facial and postural cues of disengagement that signal the patient's distress. The clinician fails to hear the patient's change in para language - the \"oh sure\" which is the patient' s explicit \"yes\"/agreement, but he r voice tone speaks a louder implicit \"no/disagreement.\" Example 3This scenario unf olds the same wa y, until the clinician responds to the pa tient's head hanging and sudden quiet with a verbal inquiry. Which nonverbal signa ls encourage the patient to disclose the source of her conflict? Discussion: After initial verbal inquiry, the clinician continues to lean f orward, relaxes her extended hand and arm, keeps eye conta ct, and opens space with her relaxed silence. How are these signa ls congruent with the clinician's verbal responses? Her empathic verbal response directed towards the patient's distress confirms the above-\u00admentioned nonverbal signals. What outcomes might differ between the two visits? We do not know the outcomes of the two visits, but we suggest that the patient is more likely to obtain the mammogram in the second instance, tha t the time spent in discussi on is likely not more than an additional minute or two, and tha t both pa tient and clinician will likely be more satisfied with the second encounter. Higher satisfa ction a t resolving or simply addressing this patient's conflict in the moment may have important positive long-\u00adterm consequences. CONCLUSION We've covered a number of nonverbal skills. All of them can enhance the doctor-\u00adpa tient relationship, and their neglect can do serious harm to the relationship. The key to working wit h these no nverbal co mmunicat ion skills is t o practice, and t o do so by breaking them do wn into small pieces. For example, you can decide to specifically monitor facial expressions in the first two or three patients you see in the off ice on a given day. Then you can switch to voice tones on another day. At still a nother time, you might choose to pay particular attention to qualities of the space in your medical \"encounters.\" While you are out and about - say at a restaurant - notice who is in rapport and who is not. Over time you'll become much more adept at reading all f our categories of nonverbal communication in yourself and in others. We predict this will make f or more congruent and rewarding excha nges with your pat ients.

The ability to consistently demonstrate curiosity and respect will assist in eliciting patients' social context and their explana tory model of illness -\u00ad and patients seldom volunteer this information. 3. Demonstration of empathic attention both to patients' reactions a nd to your own frustration with patients who hold views contrary to your own views improves communication and care. 4. Diagnostic or trea tment plans that patients will adhere to integrate their cultural beliefs with your standard-\u00adof -\u00adcare biomedical approa ch. 5. You cannot signif icantly improve your effectiveness in cross-\u00adcultural interactions unless you maintain a keen awareness of your own cultural belief s and influences. Learning go als: At the co nclusion o f this mo dule, yo u will be able to : Describe how cultural diff erences affect patient-\u00adclinician relationships. Demonstrate skills of curiosity, empathy, and respect in cross-\u00adcultural encounters. Demonstrate skills of \"empathic, curious confrontation\" nation\" in management of uncomf ortable cross-\u00adcultura l encounters. Reflect on your own cultural influences and explore how they af fect medical interviewing INTRODUCTION We invite you to envision dif ference and diversity a s resources f or improving patient care. We delineate skills that can bridge differences and lower the anxiety that accompanies straying outside your cultural \"comfort zone\" The introduction section of this module is outlined as follows: Illust rative Case: Mr. Ware How can you bridge some of the gap between the culture of medicine and Mr. Ware's concerns? Difference Differences between you and your patients test your a bility to provide the highest quality and state-\u00adof-\u00adthe-\u00adart medical ca re. Communicatio n flexibilit y In order to co-\u00adcreate successf ul relationships and serve patients by providing the best care possible, you will learn new skills, and use them f lexibly. Culture Characteristics ascribed to a cultural group (f or example, gay men, clinicians, Catholics, people from China , or people with diabetes) typica lly correlate poorly with your experience of any individual group member. Culture of medicine Becoming an effective clinician for people who do not \"live in the culture of medicine\" requires that you forge a set of \"bridging\" skills that we explore below Three key skills Effective cross-\u00adcultural communica tion is built on the cornerstone skills of curiosity, empa thy and respect. Quiz Questio ns Mr. Ware Mr. Ware' s concerns may be quite diff erent from your medical ones. You are seeing Cornelious Ware, a 67 year-\u00adold retired postal worker of Africa n-\u00adAmerican heritage. At his initial visit he disclosed a weight loss of 15 pounds over severa l months . He reported increased difficulty swallowing solids, finding that he has to chew his food past the point of its being flavorf ul in order to avoid a n uncomf ortable \"sticking\" in his throat. He had no pain and could swallow liquids fairly well. So he has avoided full meals, preferring instead to drink juices and smoothies. You suspected an obstructive esophagea l lesion, and ref erred him to a GI specialist for endoscopy. Today, he has lost 5 more pounds, without change in his other vital signs, and has no new symptoms. You do not find a note from G I in his chart. You ask him what the GI specia list advised. He says, \"I didn't go.\" Culture and the culturre o f medicine Characteristics ascribed to a cultural group (f or exa mple, gay men, clinicians, Catholics, people from China , or people with diabetes) may correlate poorly or not at all with your experience of any individual member of that group. Becoming an effective clinician for groups of people who are signif icantly different from yourself requires that you forge an additional set of bridging skills, skills that we present and explore in this module. Culture can be defined as an integrated pattern of lea rned belief s and behaviors shared among members of a group. Shared elements include thoughts, styles of communicating, ways of interacting, views of roles and relationships, values, practices, and customs. Culture is part of everyone a nd includes individual influences such as age, socioeconomic status, religion, gender, sexual orientation, occupation, disability, geographic origin, and educa tional level, among others. Culture is a helpful construct for understanding the sum total of our experienced past and anticipated f uture as it relates to our affiliation with others. Since no two people share the exact same set of experiences, beliefs, and attitudes, every encounter can be thought of as a cross-\u00adcultural experience. Additionally, remember that chara cteristics that we ascribe to a cultura l group and what happens in an encounter with any one group member seldom correlate well; our assumptions about the larger group often do not fit the individua l case. In addition to the numerous cultural f orces that shape each of us, every clinician has undergone acculturation to the professiona l lifestyle and exposure to the underlying scientif ic principles of medicine that f ew patients have experienced. Finding a bridge that can join medical culture to that of patients who live outside it requires attention to both the dif ficulty and opportunity of building those bridges. Many instances of conflict between patient and clinicia n stem from differences in the way that patients experience their illness (see \"Explanatory Models page,\" below) and the clinicia n's understanding of those symptoms as a diagnosis of disease (the biomedical model). B ecause of the inherent power differential in the patient-\u00adclinician rela tionship, it is incumbent upon clinicians to use a patient-\u00adoriented and illness-\u00adcentered approach to translate the principles of evidence-\u00ad based, standard-\u00adof-\u00adcare medicine into terms that patients understand, and to incorpora te the patient's tra ditional belief s into the plan of care. Modules 5 and 9 also discuss these principles. Difference and flexibility Difference fosters a pprehension, but also provides opportunity that can expand your a bility to serve well, to improve medical outcomes and to connect with patients to co-\u00adcreate fulf illing relationships. Difference brings both dif ficulty and opportunity. When we encounter difference in a relationship, it usually tests our habitual patterns of ini tiating and responding, and those patterns may not suff ice when we attempt to connect with someone dif ferent f rom ourselves. S uch calls to an unfa miliar way of being are opportunities to learn, unleash crea tive energy, and acquire new capacity for future encounters across differences. The encounters are dif ficult because they provoke anxiety and can threaten our sense of competence. Looking more closel y at relationship dyna mics, we find that no behavior or set of behaviors taken in isola tion by either person will lead to a desired outcome. Each rela tionship is a new co-\u00adcreation, and for a successf ul outcome, both people need to attend to the emergent, unique conditions of experienced past and anticipated f uture that create the lived present. In clinical encounters across difference, the ethical duty of service requires that clinicia ns develop f lexibility and fluency with communication strategies that enable creation of an effective environment of ca re. Clinicians create effective environments through engaging in true dialogue: iterative listening andresponding to patients with whom we are co-\u00adcreating ca ring relationships. With intention, any clinician can listen actively, treat patients with respect, a nd provide clear explanations that build satisfying relationships. Importantly, the feel-\u00adgood advantages that everyone f eels in such relationships are only one important result. Incontrovertible evidence shows that communication quality and flexibility af fects health care outcomes. Research from many domains is presented in DocCom Module 1, and notably includes better blood pressure and diabetes control, successful health behavior change, improved patient and clinician satisf action and diminished malpractice claims. Three key strategies Three key strategies help build strong and resilient relationships with individual patients who differ from you in some cultural aspect. These stra tegies, curiosity, empat hy and respect form the cornerst one of ef fective cross-\u00adcultural communication. Showing patients tha t you intend to understand their cultural background -\u00ad namely, their preferences, af filiations and cultura l concerns - helps build trust and enable better medical care. For example, evidence shows that training in cross-\u00adcultura l communication increases clinicia n awareness of the signif icant health disparities fa ced by people in the min orities of sexual orientation and socioeconomic status. As a starting point you will f ind it useful to have some familia rity with some dif ferent cultural subgroups' approaches of to health and illness. However, it would be an impossible goal to know how every aspect of every cultural group might influence an individual encounter. Furthermore, developing encyclopedic lists of cultural generalizations inclines us towards perpetua ting stereotypes. There is no one way to treat any racial, ethnic, o r other subgro up, since great cultural diversity exists within each subgro up. Every individual represents a unique m\u00e9lange tha t resists easy categorization. Fa milies a re composed of increasingly diverse mixtures of diff erent cultures. Many sources of diff erence are invisible but may be critical to patients ' sense of who they are and how they wish to be known. As you communicate with any patient, having ga ined some specific knowledge of a particular subgroup, that knowledge must be ba lanced by knowing and using effective patient-\u00adcentered and f amily-\u00adcentered communication strategies, namely, curiosity, empathy and respect. These key stra tegies, each one built on learnable skills, will not only enhance y our understanding of cross-\u00adcultural diff erences, but also build trusting relationships with individual patients. We discuss the strategies and the skills in the following pages.

Elicit ing Explanato ry Mo dels of Illness A patient's \"explanatory model of illness\" encompasses the meaning that the patient attaches to the illness, its causes, fears or concerns about its course, and hopes f or trea tment. Quiz Questio ns Elicit values, att end to hot butt ons When cultural diff erences are substantial, your a bility to show ca ring and expertise to patients, and their ability to receive these gifts, is a complex process. Ask patients about prior experience with medical care.You remember that Mr. Ware said he had not seen a doctor for years, and came to the office a t the urging of his wif e, who was alarmed at his decreased food intake. Today you ask him why he hadn' t seen a doctor f or such a long time. He says that he still feels healthy, and that doctors probably wouldn' t be able to tell him anything useful. Communication barriers f requently spring up because clinicians' and patients' assumptions and expectations differ so dramatica lly. People carry a spects of their cultural identity in different ways. Sometimes the first clues to a different cultural approa ch to health arise from unexpected reactions to or misunderstandings in one or more of the core cultural issues in Table 1. Table 1: Core Cultural Issues (\"Ho t Butt ons\")(9) Authority Physical contact Communication styles Gender and gender roles Sexuality - expression, orienta tion Family - roles, decision making Spirituality, religious expression Personal resources - financial, social Privacy, confidentiality, truth-\u00adtelling Prior negative experiences with health care systems These issues are cultural \"hot buttons\" heavily infused with meaning and signif icance, a nd usually difficult to discuss openly. Patients' interactions with clinicians will be af fected by their acculturated approach to communication style, prior experiences with hea lth care systems, gender differences, expectations for confidentiality, and age differences. Remain open and flexible and remember that patients are in unfamiliar territory, doing their best to accept your ca re across these fundamental differences. As you build relationships, a sk patients to relate a story about prior encounters with clinicians or health care systems. You might a sk, \"What challenges have you had with doctors in the past?\" If the patient has had no contact with Western h ealth care systems, consider asking about how the patient thinks about health or illness (see \"Elicit the explanatory model of illness,\" below). Pay specif ic attention to themes of cultural hot buttons (Table 1) or conflicts that arise during this dialogue. AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) Check preco ncept ions about health beliefs Invite patients to share their knowledge and understa nding with you - an invitation honors patients' expertise and autonomy, corroborates (or negates! ) your preconceptions a nd refines the accura cy of information tha t helps you to optimize care. You: I understand that religion is very important to many of my African-\u00adAmerican patients. Is that true for you? Mr. Ware: My wife is the devout one - I basically go along f or the ride. You: Sometimes people mistrust doctors because of racial issues, experimentation like at Tuskegee . [He looks a t you directly f or the f irst time all visit.] Mr. Ware: That never happened to me, doc, but you never know. Those white doctors - you really ca n't trust them. They hurt my people. They're not going to hurt me. You: I give you a lot of credit for coming in today. I can't imagine it was easy.Mr. Ware: Mm hmm. You: Nowadays we have protections that prevent a ny experimentation like that. Would you be open to hearing more about the test we'd like to do? Having a familiarity with cultural approa ches to health that are common in patient populations with whom you interact is helpful. For example, some communities believe tha t supernatural forces cause illness, so patients or families may pursue the services of specia lized shama ns or rites such as exorcism. Conversely, do not assume that your Native American patient believes that the very mention of illness will, in turn, ca use that illness (a common belief among Native Americans).Cultural groups may have different experiences in different locales. Perspectives a re heavily influenced by one's predominant culture, but each family or social unit can diverge significantly from a given cultural norm. Theref ore, rather than provide a necessarily incomplete and inaccurate taxonomy of a ll cultures here, we encourage you to refer to online or print resources to gain some generalized background information on specific ethnic and cultural groups that you encounter (12,13). If you have a preconception a bout a particular cultural approach to health, share your ideas and check to see if they are accura te for that particular encounter. \"I understand that for some Latinos, religion is a very important part of health and illness. Is that true for you? How (or how not)?\" Develo p an understanding o f the whole person Overa ll, showing interest in patients' social context and trying to know them as whole persons will help your rapport-\u00adbuilding process. Many aspects of socia l context significantly affect patients' approach to illness even though the contextual element ma y have no relationship to medical science. For example, after you tell your patient tha t he has a myocardial infarction, he may choose to leave your emergency department against medical advice beca use he lives alone, with f ew social contacts, and feels pressured to make sure tha t his cat has enough f ood for his predicted sojourn in the hospital. Your immigrant patient who completed third grade before beginning work as a manual laborer may not understand medical vocabulary a nd may harbor beliefs about illness that you view as bizarre. Table 2: Understanding who le perso ns: Social Context. Ask about the factors listed below, and preface your inquiries with a f raming statement, such as: \"The kinds of ca re we provide a nd the way we talk to patients may be different here than in the country you came from. I want to provide you the best possible care, so it would help me if I understood more about your culture.\" A. Cont rol over enviro nment (e.g., f inances, educa tion): 1. Is money a big problem in your life? 2. Are you ever short of f ood or clothing? 3. How do you keep track of appointments? 4. Are you more concerned about how your health af fects you right now or how it might affect you in the future? B. Changes in enviro nment (migration): 1. Where are you from? 2. What made you decide to come to this country/city/town? 3. When did you come? 4. How have you f ound life here compared to life in your country/city/town?5. What was medical care like there? C. So cial stressors and suppo rt netwo rk: 1. What is causing the most dif ficulty or stress in your lif e? 2. How do you ma nage this stress? 3. Do you have f riends or relatives that you can call on f or help? Who are they? D o they live close to you? 4. Are you involved in a religious or social group? D o you feel that God (or a higher power) provides a strong source of support in your lif e? D. Literacy and language: 1. How confident are you about f illing out medical f orms by yourself? 2. Do you have trouble reading your medication bottles or appointment slips? 3. What language do you spea k at home? 4. Do you ever feel that you have difficulty communicating everything you want to say to the doctor or staff? The components of context in Table 2 cannot be addressed f ully in a single clinical encounter of average length. Optimally, you will discover more about these domains as your rela tionships develop perhaps over severa l visits in the outpatient setting, or during a hospitalization). Elicit \"expl anato ry mo dels\" Your work across cultures cannot be effective unless you elicit patients' explanatory models of illness. An \"explanatory model\" encompasses the meaning that patients attach to an illness, causes of the illness, concerns about its course, and hopes f or treatment. You: What do you think is causing your swallowing problem? Mr. Ware: You said it might be a tightness or a ca ncer in my esoph agus. You: Well, what do you think it is? Mr. Ware: My wife feeds me too much. I' m here just so I can get her off my back. Probably I' m getting too fat around my swallowing tube because she makes me eat so much. Many patients respond clearly to questions about their explanatory model, while others answer with a story tha t seems tangential to the discussion. Clinicians who f ocus on the biomedical model often find such stories f rustra ting, but close attention to the subtext usually provides insight into the explanatory model. All cultures embrace ma ny beliefs about the life issues of health and illness. Individual patients may hold all, some, or none of the belief s typica lly associated with their identified culture, depending on their level of assimilation or integration. In addition to eliciting the explana tory model, determine how strongly the patientadheres to that model. Some patients may be open to a more biomedical model tha t you offer, but others will hold a fervent belief system around illness and be closed to traditional biomedical thinking or treatments. Effective treatment of the latter group of patients (at least, in the biomedical world view) may take some creative collaboration as we discuss below and see Module 11). Table 3: Questio ns that will help elicit pat ients' explanat ory mo del o f illness (13)What do you think ha s caused your problem? What do you call it? Why do you think it started when it did? How does it affect your life? How severe is it? What worries you the most? What kind of treatment do you think would work? Questio ns that will help elicit patients' health agenda: How can I be most helpf ul to you? What is most important for you? Questio ns that will help elicit patients' illness behavio r: Have you seen anyone else about this problem besides a clinicia n? Have you used nonmedica l remedies or trea tments for your problems? Who advises you about your health? Quiz Questio ns Consider the answers, then click on the Feedback-\u00adlink.. 1) \"I understand t hat some Puerto Ricans believe that certain spirits influence health and illness. Do you hold tho se beliefs?\" This questio n is an example o f: A) Checking your own preconceptions a bout cultural approa ches to health B) Developing an understanding of the patient as a whole person t C) Eliciting the patient's core va lues about health D) Eliciting the patient's explanatory model of illness Feedback 2) Co nsider a 41 year-\u00ado ld man wit h back pain. Which o f the following questio ns do es NOT elicit a dimensio n of a patient's explanat ory mo del o f illness? A) Have you seen a nyone else f or your pain besides a clinician? B) How can I be most helpful to you? C) What do you think is causing your pain? D) Where is the pain located? E) Why do you think your pain started when it did? Feedback EMPATHY Attend to the verbal and non-\u00adverbal signals of connection and rela tionship from your patients, and learn from them. Your non-\u00adverbal signals of empathy are usually more helpful than your words. You: It must be frustrating for you to have your wife tell you to eat more, and to feel forced to come here. I imagine you might f eel you're doing a favor f or her. Mr. Ware: I AM doing a favor f or her. You: I want you to know that I am not in cahoots with her - we' re here first and foremost for you and your health. Mr. Ware: OK. You: And I'd really like to thank you, truly, deeply, for telling me as much as you have, and for being honest about it. I imagine it's been difficult for you. [Mr. Ware' s expression seems to soften just a bit, though he remains silent.] The modules on \"Therapeutic Aspects of Medical Encounters\" (Module Relationship\" (Module 6), and \"Understanding the Patient's Perspective\" (Module 9) emphasize the fundamental importance of using empathy in all health care encounters, whether you a re speaking with someone of your own culture or not. Watching a nd listening for empathic signals from patients is probably the most useful method for learning appropria te expressions of empathy for a person from a different culture. You can check your impressions with the patient, and you can ask other people familiar with the culture who can act as cultural consultants or \"tra nslators\" f or you. Among the difficulties you will encounter in communica ting empathy acro ss cultures are the following: Because clinicians are f ully steeped in medical culture's emphasis on science and technology, patient's responses may be f rustrating; A patient's expla natory model may add conf using elements to conversations; Verbal statements of empathy may not build rapport with patients who ca nnot express their plight because of a language barrier, a phasia, or other tightly-\u00adheld cultural beliefs. Nonverbal empathic expressions such as voice tone and pace, smiling and eye contact are seldom fraught with cross-\u00adcultural confusion and are generally more helpful than verbal ones. See Module 14, \"It goes without sa ying\". RESPE CT Show respect by acknowledging pa tients' explanatory models when you off er biomedical plans for diagnosis or treatment. Enlist the patient as a partner and collaborator in establishing plans for diagnostic studies or treatment interventions. To maximize the chances that patients follow up on plans, use the \"ask - tell - ask\" strategy outlined in Module 10 as you explore next steps and rea ch agreemen t on them. When you undertake pla nning across differences and diverse cultures, build trust by showing respect for patients' culture a nd ideas. Successf ul outcomes depend on your covering some specif ic issues, such as those that we list below, and tha t we demonstrate in a sample dialog with Mr. Ware a nd the following video. Be aware of assumptions or preconceptions you probably carry, either because of your immersion in the biomedical culture or other aspects of your own cultural background. (Ask): Summarize the patient's explanatory model, and determine how strongly the patient believes in it. (Tell): Offer the biomedical model as briefly a s possible, avoiding jargon. Weave it together with the pa tient's explanatory model as creatively as you possibly can. This very \"This kind of \"merging\" of expla natory models usually involves discovering a creative combination of facts and conjecture. You may choose to reveal your own preconceptions, or to offer a suggestion as to how to proceed.(Ask): Ask the patient whether the new (modif ied) model makes sense, and elicit f urther questions and potential conflicts. (Tell) (Ask) (Tell): Continue to summarize, elicit understanding, a nd clarify. Reach Agreement on the best compromise possible, which will depend on the trust in your relationship, the creativity of your weaving a tapestry that integrates the medical model with patients' explanatory models, and how stringently patients carry their explanatory models. You: Mr. Ware, sounds like you' re still ha ving problems swallowing, and I can see that you're still losing some weight. Mr. Ware: Everyone tells me I look better. You: Yes, but am I correct that you used to enjoy eating but don't any more? You said you thought it might be getting f at around your esophag us? Mr. Ware: Yeah, I think so. You: Like you said, I think there mig ht be something there. I don't know about f at. Like I said last time, there might be a narrowing in your esopha gus. It could be many things, and one of those things could be cancer. Mr. Ware: Well, doc, wha t do you say we do about it? You: I' d like for you to be able to enjoy eating again. I'd like for you to stop losing weight so rapidly. Would you like those two things? Mr. Ware: Yeah, probably. You: Ideally, I' d ask the GI doctor to take a look with a scope and a ca mera. But it seems like you might be worried that they' ll experiment on you? Mr. Ware: You just ca n't trust them to do what's right f or you. You: If I could, I would refer you to a black or Asian GI specialist. Ma ybe I could see if there is one who could do your scope test. Mr. Ware: Keep talking . You: There is one GI doctor who I really trust. He is white, but he is one of the most trustworthy people I know. Mr. Ware: May be I should talk to him first to figure out f or myself. You: That sounds like a good next step. AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) Decisio ns: Central Themes When clinicians and patients fa ce important decisions, certain central themes, \"hot button\" issues such as family and authority or thoughts a bout body organs and functions, and non-\u00adverbal cues come to the fore. The ro le of family and autho rity in decisio n-\u00admaking The role of family a nd authority a re fundamental cultural themes, anda key \"hot buttons\" among those a lready mentioned(Table 1). Especia lly in difficult situations, patients' f amilies' attitudes to clinician advice influence medical decision-\u00admaking. In addition, you will need to discover the cultural proscriptions around whether to tell patients their dia gnosis, which f amily members to inform and how and when to disclose f acts. Trust is of critical importance in people whose cultural background includes suspicions of Western medicine. Lack of trust may stem from patients' or families' strong faith in their own healing traditions, and persona l, historical, or perceived experience with inappropriate or withheld medical care. Impo rtance of language and ideas abo ut bo dy organs Different cultures express illness through body parts. For example, in Chinese, there is no verba l expression for \"depression\"; the closest description translates to \"heavy heart,\" which in literally translated, culturally insensitive encounters can lead to expensive and unnecessary work-\u00adups f orcoronary artery disease. Nonverbal co mmunicat ion Physical conta ct is another central cultural theme; a patient may construe touch as an unaccepta ble breach of persona l space, no matter how routine or innocently intended you perceive it to be. Physical presence, tone of voice, and gestures send powerful messa ges. The United States (except f or some Southern regions) and Canada are relatively \"low-\u00ad context\" cultures in which information is clearly delineated. In contrast, \"high-\u00adcontext\" cultures, such as Japan and Colombia, generally place higher value in social behaviors, a mbiguity, and politeness, so tha t listeners infer messa ges without direct delineation, and nonverbal signs are of paramount importance (19). In addition, some gestures that are acceptable in your culture may be insults in others. For example, the gesture used in the United States to show agreement or \"OK\" (thumb and forefinger formed in a circle, with the remaining f ingers fa nned outwa rd) represents a n unprintable insult in some southern Europea n cultures. It is impossible to catalog all the world' s gestures here. We resign ourselves to the fact that we will occasionally ma ke a cultural faux pas. Learning from these mistakes in a dignified and respect ful manner without too much self-\u00adflagellation serves our patients (and us) most f ruitfully.

Review your non verbal signals Videotaping and reviewing a cross-\u00adcultural interview increases your awareness of the eff ects of your nonverbal communications Cont inue Exploring and Develo ping Your Awareness o f Cultural Differences Personal awareness does not have a discrete end-\u00adpoint, but is an ongoing process, particularly releva nt to your ef fectiveness in communica ting and building relationships across differences. Check yo ur Perso nal Awareness: a Cro ss-\u00adcultural Enco unterA quiz, by Tonya Fa ncher, U California, Davis; with Marilyn Mochel, Palee Moua - both from Healthy House, Merced Discern your o wn ho t butt ons Unless you ma ke a concerted ef fort to discern how your cultural hot buttons a ffect your interactions with people different from yourself, you cannot enhance your skill with cross-\u00ad cultural communications. As you ref lect on Mr. Ware' s difficulty in interacting with the health care system, you are struck by an internal conflict. You wish to respect for Mr. Ware' s wishes, you know that a paternalistic approach would be ineffective, a nd the standard of care is to pursue upper endoscopy. You see that your inner conflict is a cross-\u00adcultural one - between older and younger, between his conception of his illness and your a cculturation into medicine, and possibly other cultural factors such as differences in dealing with a uthority or power. You see that your inner struggle directly correlates to the developing conflict in your rela tionship. You realize that to resolve this conflict and provide the best care for Mr. Ware; your paramount considera tion is to foster a sense of honesty a nd trust - by modeling honesty and trustworthiness. You: Mr. Ware, I am being as honest as I can huma nly be. I know I can't force you to do anything you don't wan t, and I respect that. At the same time, as your doctor, I'm feeling anxious to find out what is causing your symptoms, so we can get on with what to do next. As I mentioned, I have complete trust in the doctor I' m referring you to. Mr. Ware: You seem like you mean it. You [laughing]: I absolutely do! Mr. Ware: All rig ht. I promise I'll g o and talk to the GI guy. But if I can' t trust him, I need you to find me someone I can trust. You: I promise to help work on that with you. Review yo ur no n verbal signals Videotaping and reviewing a cross-\u00adcultural interview increases your awareness of the ef fects of your nonverbal communications An additional effective method to develop persona l awareness is to videotape a cross-\u00adcultural encounter, after obtaining the patient's consent. Review this videotape wit h a preceptor a nd colleagues. Not only do you increase your understanding of the non-\u00adverba l cues you send, particularly to a patient who does not have complete command over the language you use, but you also augment your knowledge of your verbal communication patterns. Expand awareness o f difference Effectiveness in communica ting and building relationships across differences does not have a discrete en dpoint. When you interact with patients whose diff erences from you are always multiple, those diff erences frequently contribute to confusion. The more deeply you understa nd your own cultural influences, biases, and approa ches, the easier it will be to note diff erences in others'. We hope you will va lue being interested and appreciative of your patients' cultural identities and value approa ching othercultures with fewer preconceptions. Review the \"Ref lection Questions\" listed at the beginning of this module as one way to explore and apprecia te influential a spects of your own professional and cultural identity. Then revisit the Questions, particularly af ter challenging experiences, a nd continue to cla rify how your own cultural heritage influences your clinical role. Share your reflections with other health care providers in order to enhance your understanding. We predict that if you apply the techniques of curiosity, empa thy, and respect in saf e collegial environments, the experience you gain there will assist you during difficult patient interactions. Note that study of DocCom Modules 2 and 4 will enhance your a bility to explore persona l issues relevant to your professional development. Check yo ur perso nal awareness: a by California, Davis; with Marilyn Mochel, Palee Moua - both from Healthy House, Merced 1. You are seeing a 60 y.o. Hmong woman f or an initial visit to your practice. She does not speak English, and her grandson accompanies her, telling you tha t his grandmother has headaches and difficulty with sleep. After you establish that the heada ches a nd sleep difficulty are the only issues for today, what is the recommeded ne xt step? A) Ask, \"Please give me a little more information about your headaches; like wha t brings them on, how long do they last, does anything make them better?\" B) Use your standardized approach for all Southeast Asian patients to develop a treatment plan C) Ask, \"Do your headaches make it difficult to do some things you would norma lly like to do?\" D) Ask, \"What pain medications have you tried to help your headaches?\" E) Look f or a staff member who might understa nd Hmong Feedback If the option is feasible, ask the patient if she would prefer a female or male interpreter. 2. When the interpreter arrives, you lea rn that the patient f led to Thailand after her husband and 3 oldest children were killed in the Vietnam war. She lived in a refugee camp and raised 3 young children alone, then emigrated to the US. She now lives with her oldest daughter a nd her 4 children. The patient tells you tha t the headaches have been going on for years, and states through the interpreter that she has a \"broken liver.\" Which of the following is the most appropriate next step: A) Ask about GI symptoms like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bloody or black stools, jaundice, lethargy and so on. B) Ask for help understanding what the expression \"broken liver\" means. C) Ask whether she is using non-\u00adtradi tional healers and medications. D) Ask whether she has been tested for tuberculosis. E) Ask whether she drinks any alcoholic beverages. Feedback The interpreter expla ins that \"broken liver\" often reflects stress, and may be an indica tor of more depressive symptoms. Following this lead, you learn from the patient that in addition to difficulty sleeping, she has a poor appetite and has considered taking her own life, although she denies active suicidal ideation. A fter discussion with her, you agree that a medication (a low dose anti-\u00ad depressa nt) would be a good next step, and you ref er her to a mental health agency withexpertise in Southeast Asian mental health. In counseling her about the treatment plan, which of the f ollowing would NOT be an appropriate statement or action? A) Tell her you will see her again in 6 weeks. B) Tell her the expected side effects and time to resolution of symptoms. C) Tell her that you and the agency counselor will work jointly to help alleviate her symptoms. D) Tell her that you would like her to bring in an a dult fa mily member or friend who can help her with the medication. E) Ma ke empathic statements that show you understand her distress about dif ficulty with sleeping and poor life functioning. Feedback PREJUDICE When patients, families, or colleagues express (knowingly or unknowingly) a cultural epithet or make a prejudicial or discriminatory remark, you can develop response options along the continuum of curiosity, empa thy and respect. When a sking Mr. Ware background questions about his health-\u00adrelated behaviors, you ask, \"Are you sexually active with men, women, or both?\" He gives you an incredulo us look and says, \"Of course, women. Who do those people think they are, anyway?\" All clinicians find tha t answering with respect for both oneself and a valued \"other\" person in the face of a discriminatory remark is one of the hardest interview moments we ever encounter. One of the most powerf ul wa ys to build trust and relationship is to bridge this gap in a manner that values preservation of everyone 's dignity. We offer below potential response exa mples, more as guides rather tha n as specif ic prescriptions. Every situation is unique, and there are no simple \"correct\" answers so we off er potential advantages and risks with each a spect of the continuum of curiosity, empathy and respect. Respo nses: Prejudice Check o ut the video o n the left Which of the following strategies might you use to respond? Curio sity \"I'd like to hear more about your a ttitudes towards 'those people.'\" or, \"What do you mean by 'those people'?\" Possible advant ages: can be easily used as a reflexive response; can make a patient feelheard; ca n elicit a story or explanatory model that might ma ke you understand why the patient holds that opinion; can be usef ul in situat*ions where a patient launches a subtle epithet (a mere knowing glance, or something like \"well, you and I know about people like that\"). Possible risks: you ma y encourage additional remarks that could make you more uncomfortable. Empathic respo nse \"Sounds like you have real misg ivings ay lesbian patient's statement is easily done; this \"simple\" response shows that you heard the patient; and may elicit a story or explanatory model that can help you understand why the patient holds that opinion. Possible risks: and empathic reflecton may encourage f urther remarks that could make you more uncomfortable. Empathic, curio us confro ntatio n \"Your position puts m e in a bit of a bind, since I work with many gay colleagues. What do you feel that does to our work together?\" Possible advant ages: establishes a sense of relationship and non-\u00ada bandonment; offers self-\u00ad disclosure and an opportunity f or truth-\u00adtelling for you; offers the patient an opportunity for explana tion. Possible risks: self-\u00addisclosure can feel threa tening depending on your own cultural background; may come across to the patient as a power play Respectful explanatio n \"Since many of my colleagues are gay, and since we are doing the best we can f or your health, I would f ind it most helpf ul if you would keep those opinions to yourself, and I will do the same.\" or, \"I'm sorry, I don' t share your views, but I would like to reinforce the importance of our work together.\" or, \"I see lots of different people who do lots of different things, and for me, I' ve found that I can't make any assumptions.\" Possible advant ages: of fers self-\u00addisclosure and an opportunity f or truth-\u00adtelling for you; establishes a firm mutual ground rule in agreeing to disagree Possible risks: can come across as condescending or as a power play; may miss hearing a story that might make you understand why the patient holds that opinio n Silence / Empathic Redirect ion \"Some might find what you sa id pretty inflammatory. Let's move on.\" or, \"[clinicia n raises eyebrows]\" Possible advant ages: very useful if you are about to lose your temper or might say something you may regret laterPossible risks: you ma y miss hearing a story that could help you understand why the patient holds that opinion; a patient may interpret silence as agreement w ith the attitude or commentCont inue Pract ice -\u00ad Respo is risk-\u00adfree.

You should probably avoid using words such as \"inappropriate\" or \"offensive\" when responding, and at least hesitate to use them in your initial response. These words reveal more about your cultural orientation and your emotional state, a nd tend to underscore your position of power in patient-\u00adclinician relationships. Your professiona l duty is to combine standard-\u00adof-\u00adcare medicine with a patient-\u00adcentered approach. You may choose to challenge a patient's underlying cultural assumptions, and occasionally this challenge may enhance your relationship. However, you must balance the benef its of sharing your own agenda and bringing such a disagreement to consciousness against the potentia l lessening of rapport, poorer adhe rence to medical plans, or underscoring of the power dynamics in your relationships. As you strive to expand the range of relationship situations in which you can provide service, taking the time to ref lect and ta lking a bout these situations with colleagues or people with whom you feel a llied and on whose personal support you can depend is always helpf ul. Behavior skills checklist 1. Show curiosity about the patient's cultural background. 2. Encourage the patients to tell a story a bout prior experiences with medical culture or illness. 3. Elicit information about hot button issues such as family roles, religion and truth telling, among others. 4. Ask about control over environmentpa tients environment and social context, (e.g.,for example, their finances, priorities), changes in environment (e.g., migration), support networks, and socia l stressors, and langua ge. 5. Respond with empathy and respect as patients describe experiences with the culture of medicine, their hot button issues, or their social context.6. Share your preconceptions about the patient' s cultural group' s approach to health and illness, and ask the patient if the ideas are accurate. 7. Elicit about patients' explanatory model of illness and determine how strongly they believe in it. 8. When working with a patient on a therapeutic plan use a collaborative \"ask-\u00adtell-\u00ada sk\" approach. 9. When establishing diagnostic or treatment plans, incorporate the patient' s explanatory model as creatively as possible. 10. In difficult, uncertain or potentially prejudicial cross-\u00adcultural situations, respond with empathic and curious confrontation, respectful explanation, or silence. 11. Demonstrate an interest in increa sing your a wareness of difference, discerning your hot buttons a nd adjusting your responses to prejudicial situations. Literat ure References 1.

How do you feel when people you care about engage in unhealthy or risky behaviors?2. What diff iculties prevent patients from taking their pills, using condoms, or stopping drinking? 3. Does motiva tion for behavior change originate within a person or is it brought to bear f rom outside a person? 4. On a scale of 0-\u00ad10, how convinced a re you tha t it is important for clinicians to learn specif ic skills for helping patients adhere to treatment regimens-or change an unhealthy or risky behavior? 5. How confident (0-\u00ad10) are you tha t you will be able to use these specif ic skills when you are tired, multi-\u00adtasking, and f rustra ted about what patients actually do? 6. How difficult is it for you to respect patients' autonomy to make a choice that you believe might be harmful to goals they have f or themselves? Key Principles: 1. Many patients seem unwilling or unable to adhere to recommendations or change an unhealthy or risky behavior. 2. Nonetheless, research shows that many patients successf ully change behaviors in response to brief counseling interventions. 3. Clinicians who counsel effectively about behavior change use specific assessment and advising skills that research shows are of proven benefit. Learning go als: At the co nclusion o f this mo dule, yo u will be able to : Describe the \"5 A' s\" model for helping pa tients change a behavior. Assess patients' \"stage\" of change, and their conviction and confidence about changing. Explore and appreciate patients' attitudes, values, and feelings about behaviors and changes in behaviors. Respond empathically and collaboratively when patients voice ambivalence or reluctance about changing behavior, including risky behaviors. According to patients' readiness, colla borate and negotiate your recommendations and advice about adherence and other beha vior cha nges. INTRODUCTION Extensive resea rch produced robust evidence tha t the use of patient-\u00adcentered and relationship-\u00adcentered counseling skills enhances patients' likelihood of successf ul change. We review the \"5 A's\" -\u00ad Assess, Agree, Advise, Assist, and Arrange -\u00ad and describe specif ic skills to implement each \"A.\" Patient educa tion and counseling is a core function of all medical encounters and an essential component of quality medical care. (1-\u00ad3 , 69, 70). Indeed, clinicia n use of effective communica tion and counseling skills promotes treatment adherence and facilitates change in patients' risky health behaviors, including smoking, problema tic substance use or unsaf e sexual practices. (1 , 4-\u00ad9) Unfortunately, hea lth behavior counseling ra tes fall well below the targets recommended in Healthy People 2010, the US Health and Human Services' blueprint f or preventive and behaviora l health objectives for the nation.(9,10 ) Multiple patient and clinician barriers to eff ective intervention are shown in Table 1. Clinicia n skepticism about spending time on patient educa tion and counseling derives in large measure from these barriers.(6 ,9) By Pat ients By Clinicians Not knowledgeable about risks Not enough time in visit Unaware of more acceptable options for changeNot trained in counseling Lacks social support f or changeFrustration with patients who seem not ready to change Feels too stressed to changeUncomfortable giving up control over goals and options f or change Lacks confidence from prior failuresDifficulty feeling comf ortable with less than perfect plan Lacks support and understanding Difficulty appreciating patient perspectives Feels ashamed or guilty a bout behavior and therefore responds defensivelyDifficulty expressing empathy when patient responds defensively Table 1: B arriers to Health B ehavior Counseling Despite these barriers, multiple studies show that clinicians who participate in specif ic training interventions do a better job of health beha vior counseling (11 -\u00ad16). Moreover, interventions tha t use a team-\u00adbased approach and combine clinician training with supportive prompts or other organizational interventions improve counseling ef fectiveness even f urther.(17 -\u00ad24, 69, 70). THE 5 A's -\u00ad A UNIFYING APPROACH The \"5 A' s\" construct derives from decades of painstaking research studies across many disciplines. The 5 A' s remind clinicians how to eff ectively promote health behavior change in everyday encounters. Over severa l decades, researchers studied behaviors that a re detrimental to health, such as smoking, drug use, overea ting, a nd not taking prescribed medicines, seeking methods to help people change. Several eff ective models emerged, including the Transtheoretical Model of Change [27] , Social Cognitive Theory (28, 29), Self-\u00adD etermination Theory (30 , 31), and Motivationa l Interviewing.(32-\u00ad34 , 67) The 5 A's framework -\u00ad Assess, Advise, Agree, Assist, Arrange follow-\u00adup -\u00ad incorporates elements of several models cited above and is consistent with their principles. Many skills that a re required to carry out elements of the 5 A' s parallel or overla p skills that are demonstrated in D ocCom Modules 5-\u00ad12. Table 2 lists the 5 A's. 1. Assess -\u00ad risk, past behavior, rea diness, importance/conviction and confidence< 2. Advise -\u00ad and inform< 3. Agree -\u00ad on goa ls and methods 4. Assist -\u00ad make plans that address and overcome barriers 5. Arrange -\u00ad follow-\u00adup Table 2: The 5 A's (Modif ied from (9 )) Despite the many barriers previously shown in Table 1, multiple studies show that clinicians who participate in specific training interventions do a better job of hea lth behavior counseling (11 -\u00ad16). Moreover, team-\u00adbased interventions that combine clinician counseling with supportive prompts or other organiza tional interventions improve effectiveness even f urther.(17 -\u00ad24, 69, 70) The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that clinicia ns adopt the \"5A's,\" because this construct has shown success in general health care settings. (9 ) Research indicates that clinicians have difficulty delivering a ll 5 A' s during a single encounter, but also demonstrates tha t a team approach that distributes counseling across multiple conta cts is both f easible and effective.(71-\u00ad75 ) Interviews in which the f ocus is on behavior change contain many f amiliar elements as well as new skills. The new skills relate to \"assessing rea diness\" to change, and \"conviction and confidence\" about change, and we describe and demonstrate all the 5A's core elements in the sections that follow. Also, we extend a nd elaborate on key skills f rom several \"Essential Elements\" Do cCom modules that conver ge in the 5 A's model, particularly Modules 8, 9 and behavio r Begin inquiry with open-\u00adended questions about health behaviors. Follow up by using empathy skills that not only build trust, but a lso help patients to reveal their own biases, beliefs and feelings about those behaviors . The first A, Assess, focuses on gathering information about health behaviors, belief s about the behaviors, ideas about and experience with change, a nd facilitators and barriers to change. Assessment usually begins with open-\u00adended questions about health beha viors. Assessment targets include: 1) adherence to treatment and medication recommendations; 2) tobacco use, risky drinking, sedentary behavior, d iet, sexual practices; 3) self -\u00admanagement behaviors for chronic illness -\u00ad namely, self -\u00admonitoring, symptom management, functions of daily living a nd following through with medical visits; and 4) patients' ideas, belief s and feelings about those behaviors and changing them, in order to tailor advice and assistance about change to patients' readiness, motivation and needs. The following dialogue demonst rates assessment of a patient's adherence to plans for treatment of congestive heart f ailure. Doctor: \"Many people have diff taking medica tions a nd doing a ll the other things that are necessary to manage their heart condition. What difficulties have you been having?\" Patient: \"Well, to be honest, I have ha d a hard time remembering to take my medications when I am supposed t o take them.\" D: \"It sounds like it has been pretty cha llenging for you.\" P: \"Yes, it has....Sometimes I just g et tired of taking pills. It seems you add new ones all the time, and then you change them. Isn't there a better way?\"D: \"I ca n see that you are pretty f rustra ted. I appreciate how hard you have been working to manage your condition and ta ke all of your medications. Let's see whether we can something to organize a better regimen f or you.\" The clinician begins the assessment with an open-\u00adended question (after a brief preface), then follows with empathic statements. A legitimizing (a lso called norma lizing or validating) statement is used (\"Many people have diff iculty.......\") and then reflective listen ing and a partnership statement. Use of these core skills builds rapport and increases the likelihood of adherence and other health behavior change outcomes.(8 , 35) Assess readiness for change Elicit information to assess patients' motivational readiness for underta king change - evaluate their \"stage of change.\" Extensive resea rch demonstrates that eliciting patients' reflections about their desire, ability, reasons or need for behavior change promotes subsequent health behavior change.(8 , 9, 32) After gathering information on a targeted behavior and learning about the patient's beliefs a nd feelings, complete the first \"A\" with an assessment of motivational rea diness. (27 , 36) Some research suggests that individuals who change a behavior progress through a series of \"stages.\" Indeed, clinicia ns find that the stages concept helps them more fully understand the difficulty of behavior change and the dilemmas their patients fa ce. The stages are: Preco ntemplatio n -\u00ad unaware of a problem or no intention to change in the foreseeable future Cont emplat ion -\u00ad ambivalent about changing with no commitment to change in the near future Determinatio n -\u00ad intends to take action within the next month or has made some recent changes in beha vior Actio n -\u00ad actively attempting to change Maintenance -\u00ad has changed a nd needs to prevent slips and relapse Relapse -\u00ad has changed for extended periods, but has returned to prior behavior West(76) presents evidence to suggest tha t clinicians should avoid designating or labeling an individua l patient as \"in stage X.\" S tage definitions are sometimes less certain than they seem, they may overlap, or a patient may manifest chara cteristics of several stages in a single conversation (2 ). Further, many patients harbor some a spect of motiva tional readiness of which they are not aware in the moment or which they cannot or do not articulate (77). Their clinicians may then miss an opportunity to fan or ignite that motivational spark. Thinking only about \"stage\" may allow clinicians to avoid -\u00ad consciously or unconsciously, see DocCom Modules 1,2,3 -\u00ad the ambiguity of behavior change conversations a nd prematurely limit dialogue, especially if they deem patients to be in precontemplation. \"After all,\" they say to themselves, \"this patient wish es to avoid the lumpiness, snail's pace progress and frequent fa ilures of trying to change behavior.\" As an aid to more fully appreciating the nature of the stages, D r. Dan Duffy engages a patient in a series of short videos. Video examples: When you click \"stages of change\" buttons above, the example shows what a patient might typically say in a particular stage. Assess co nvict ion and co nfidence Assess patients' sense of importance regarding changing a behavior -\u00ad their co nviction-\u00ad as well as their perceived ability to successfully change -\u00ad their co nfidence. Understanding change as a \"process\" rather tha n an \"event\" assis ts clinicians in engaging patients' intrinsic sparks of motivation, no matter how dim. Many clinicians who see unhealthy behaviors reflexively suggest an a ction-\u00adbased strategy such as medication or referral to counseling, just as do patients' f riends, spouses and parents. B ecause many patients are unconvinced, or lack confidence (they seem to be in an early \"stage,\") action suggestions often \"f all on deaf ears,\" producing frustration, irritation or confusion for everyone. (37, 38) Placing emphasis on patients' belief s and perspectives about the importance of change, a nd confidence about success at change helps clinicians avoid not only the traps of \"labeling,\" and \"they aren' t ready to talk,\" but also avoid the urge to recommend action strategies too soon. Conviction assesses what patients believe about the importance of taking action, while confidence assesses what patients believe about their ability to change a behavior despite obstacles or barriers (sometimes called their \"self-\u00adef ficacy.\") (33, 34 ) In addition to assessing which \"stage\" patients seem to be in, assessing patients' conviction and confidence helps ascerta in motivational readiness, a nd helps the clinicia n to appropriately ta ilor the next interventions. Many clinicians use a \"ruler\", a numerica l rating scale shown below that assists in clarif ying the extent of patients' overall \"readiness,\" builds trust and usually encourages addi tional helpful dialogue.Figure 1: Visual \"ruler\" Frame questions as follows: Convictio n or importance -\u00ad-\u00ad\"On a scale of 0-\u00ad10, how convinced are you that (behavior... like exercise or stopping drinking) is important?\" Confidence or self -\u00adefficacy -\u00ad-\u00ad\"Let's suppose for a moment that you were a 10, completely convinced that you should start exercising (or quit drinking ;) on a 0-\u00ad10 scale, how confident a re you that you would be able to get a solid start on this in the coming 2-\u00ad3 weeks?\" When conviction scales very low (e.g. 0-\u00ad2), the patient is saying \"My readiness to think a bout this issue is very low,\" and her \"stage\" would be near precontemplation. As discussed, stage and readiness each describe aspects of the change process. With higher conviction but low to intermediate confidence, the patient is saying \"I' m thinking about this, maybe I'm ready to act,\" and the \"stage\" could be contemplation or determination. Patients with high conviction and intermediate to high confidence are typically saying, \"I'm on board, and ready to find out what action I can take next to stop (or start) this behavior,\" and the \"stage\" would be action. Assess readiness t o continue Be certain to ask permission to carry on. Continue to use \"B uild Relationship\" empathy skills; specif ically, express a ppreciation of patients' past efforts. Every action, successful or not, is a \"learning opportunity.\" The following example demonstrates how a clinician uses the ruler to assess the interest of a young woman in a dopting the healthy behavior of using a birth control pill -\u00ad or the healthy alternative of having her partner use condoms. The patient has asked for a \"morning after pill\". Doctor: \"Have you considered asking your partner to use condoms when you have sex?\" Patient:\"No, not really. He doesn't like them.\" D:\"So, it's hard to ask him to use them.\" P:\"Yeah, I don't want to push him to do something he doesn' t want to do.\" D:\"I see. Would it be ok if I asked you a few questions about your views toward condom use?\" P: \"Yeah, I guess.\" D:\"Ok, on a scale of 0 to 10, how convinced are you that it is important to use condoms during sex?\" P:\"Oh, I would say a 4.\" D:\"A 4....what led you to say 4 and not lower?\" P:\"Well, I know they can keep me from g etting pregna nt....and I know they can help me to avoid a n infection.\" D:\"That' s right! I am glad you understand some of the benefits. Anything else that makes i t a 4 a nd not lower?\" P:\"Well, I certainly don' t want to get AIDS.\" D:\"No one wants to get AIDS.\" P:\"My partner has been tested and he is f ine.....but I g uess you never know.\" D:\"Right again. What would it take to raise the importance of using condoms?\" P:\"Well, maybe if I thought I could g et him to use them.\" D:\"Hmmm...so you need some help in convincing him of the value of using them.\" P:\"Tha t's for sure!\" D:\"I have some thoughts about how you might talk with him, and I also can provide you with some information on that topic f rom Pla nned Parenthood. Would you be interested in hearing them?\" P:\"Tha t would be good. Thanks! \" The interaction above demonstrates important characteristics of effective health behavior counseling; namely, respect for patients' preferences and support of patient a utonomy.(39 ) In the dialogue the clinicia n seeks the patient's permission to assess her belief s and feelings, which the patient grants, even if hesitantly. In the dia logue, the clinicia n goes on to use the conviction scale. A sking \"'why 4 and not lower\" stimulated her to reflect, and subsequently express \"change talk\". (See Appendix) Then, the clinician uses a follow-\u00adup question (\"wha t would it take to ... convict ion?\") to identify a n important barrier to change, as well as discover a potential solution. As this conversation illustrates, in addition to assessing beliefs about change tha t are seldom made explicit in medical interviews, enga ging in this dialogue usually fa cilitates patients' making additional statements about motivation, thoughts, ideas and beliefs, as well as about previous actions or steps they 've heard a bout from f riends, T.V. or the news. This is true even when patients protest tha t they do not like to use number scales. One final point about this dialogue -\u00ad asking why the number the patient chose is not LOWER than the number chosen encourages patients to voice any thoughts they have about change in POSITIVE terms, smoothing a transition to talking about recommendations. These principles are highlighted in the brief summary of Motivatio nal Int erviewing in the Appendix, below. DocCom Module 10 discusses \"A sking permission\" in more detail, and Module 10videos demonstrate this skill. Relapse When patients disclose relapse into a prior behavior pattern, assess their feelings about the relapse. Then, assess both pa st change strategies a nd conviction and confidence a bout future change. The data about feelings and readiness to learn f rom the relapse helps clinicians to respond with a ppropriate counseling strategies. Patient: \"I feel a bit ashamed to tell you this.....I went back to sm oking last month.\" Doctor: \"You seem upset about it.\" P:\"Yes.....I had worked so hard to get off those darn cigarettes.\" D:\"Yes, you worked very hard. So, wha t happened?\" P:\"Well, I had weaned myself off the patch a bout 2 months ago and I was doing fine. Then my boss made increased demands on my time. I had several new projects to complete a nd felt anxious about getting them done. One night, I was going t hrough some dra wers looking for some papers....and would you believe it, I came across a n old pack of cigarettes. I thought I would just smoke one to get me through the night. Then, I smoked another, then another. I felt terrible\" D:\"Terrible.\" P:\"Yes, like a failure.\" D:\"Failure is P:\"Well, I returned to smoking....I failed.\" D:\"Actually, you were free of cigarettes f or almost 6 months. S o, you successf ully avoided smoking more than 3500 cigarettes before having that first cigarette. That sounds successf ul to me. In f act, many f olks need to quit repeatedly before they learn what it takes to stay a non-\u00adsmoker.\" P:\"I guess you are right. So, what do I do now?\" D:\"Well, let me ask you a few questions, and then we'll think together.\" P:\"Sure.\"D:\"How convinced are you that it is important to quit again?\" P:\"Oh, it is still a 10.\" D:\"Ok, you are still convinced about the importa nce of quitting. That's great. How confident are you tha t you can quit a gain, on that scale of 0 - 10?\" P:\"Oh, I'd say a 5 or 6 right now.\" D:\"So, what makes it a 5 and not lower?\" P:\"Well, the patch really helped me...it cut the craving way down.\" D:\"What else helped?\"P:\"Well, I used those strategies to get ready, they helped too. And the online support group you suggested....that was wonderf ul.\" D:\"Sounds like you have a number of ideas about what can help you to quit again.\" Discussion: In the dia integrates \"B skills of attentive listening and empathy (D ocCom Module 6) with the assessment of conviction and confidence. The clinician \"asks\" directly about the pa tient's experience with relapse, and this assessment leads the patient smoothly into a discussion of her willingness to try quitting a gain. The clinician' s assessment of her past successf ul quitting strategies brings to light ideas tha t they may jointly draw on to produce a specific plan (see Agree a nd Assist below). Advise After completing an assessment with \"asks\" that clarify facts, feelings a nd belief s, begin to \"tell\" information and advice. Offer information in small chunks, and continually check with patients about their understanding and agreement. Offering \"advice\" is the 5A's element most fa miliar to clinicians. Controlled studies show that following a n assessment with very brief a dvice -\u00adsuggesting a specif ic behavior change -\u00ad is an effective intervention for promoting change in health behaviors such as smoking cessation, or reduction in risky drinking. Refer to DocCom Modules 10 and 11 for \"tell\" stra tegies about giving advice. When more than a few moments a re available for interaction, put advice into patients' specif ic contexts so a s to maximize ef fectiveness, a s shown in the following exa mple. Doctor: \"As your doctor, I have some inf ormation about how cutting down on smoking can favorably affect your health. Would y ou be interested in hearing about these?\" Patient: \"OK, I suppose.\" D: \"Stopping smoking will reduce the number and seriousness of your lung infections. Quitting should a lso allow us to reduce the amount of medication you have to take to control your asthma. What do you make of this?\" P: \"I won't have to take as much medication?\" D: \"That's correct ....and that should help to address some of your concerns about finances. Quitting smoking will allow you to save a bunch of money - at a pack a day you are spending quite a bit on cigarettes.\" P: \"I could sure use that extra money.\" As noted previously, show respect f or patients' autonomy by \"asking\" permission before giving advice, especially when conviction is low. Once permission is granted share information using an \"Ask, Tell, Ask\" sequence. For example, before giving advice about monitoring blood sugars, you might ask, \"What do you understand about the benef its of checking your blood sugars?\" Always deliver information in small bits, and then assess what the patient heard a nd learned. Agree Tension always exists between small steps and \"optimal\" health behavior change. Collaborative agreement on an achievable step f orward secures progress, in contra st topersuading patients to accept \"optimal\" goals that they are unlikely to achieve. Agreeing on a measurable and achievable goal for change makes eva luation of progress toward change feasible, and promotes small successes instead of big failures. Goal setting is a crucial determinant of successf ul behavior change outcomes (41,43,44), but agreement on goals for change is too of ten absent f rom patient encounters.(42 ) Foster a collaborative process for identifying goals, one that includes eliciting and clarif ying patients' goals, a rticulating common ground.(42 ,45,46) Demo nstrate a collaborative stance by using partnership skills and exploring patients' perspectives (DocCo m Modules 6, 9) in a non-\u00adjudgmental way. Time spent on seeking agreement on simple and realistic treatment goals is time well used, and increases the likelihood of successf ul change. Help patients set rea listic goals, and foster autonomy by supporting their choices. An achievable change goal, such as \"take the diabetes pill twice daily\" is more important than a bigger step that is likely to fail, such as \"check sugar level 4 times a day and adjust eating and a ctivity to optimize blood sugar levels.\" The foremost goal of collaboration is to fully empower patients so tha t they can take on the hard work of behavior change. \"Settling for less\" than optimal behavior change from a health perspectiv e may be difficult, but remembering that patients control their actions between visits may help you be pa tient during the change process. For example, goal options f or ambivalent patients engaged in hazardous drinking might include simply monitoring drinking, or reviewing educational materials, or supporting their idea to go to an AA meeting with a f riend, just to see what it is like. Quiz: diabetes ma nagement Quiz. Read the case a nd dialogue below and identify the skills D r. W utilizes a s she collaborates with Ms. D to establish an achievable weight loss goal. Dr. W has ca red for Ms. D for yea rs, and af ter discovery of Type II diabetes many months ago, they are continuing to improve management. Ms. D has succeeded in taking oral hypoglycemic medication regularly, checking blood glucoses daily and monitoring her diet ca refully but she is frustrated that despite these successes her hemoglobin A1C is still high. So far, she ha s not been able to lose weight or increase her physical activity. Find \"summary, legitimizatio n, partnership, appreciat ion, seeking perspective, ask and tell\" in the dialogue below. Doctor W: \"So, to summarize, it sounds like you have been checking your blood sugars very diligently, taking your medication every day and trying hard to f ollow the dietician's recommendations. You are having a tough time f itting activity into your routine and you have been struggling to lose weight. Though your hemog lobin A1C is down from the last visit, it is still close to 8 and both you and I would like to see it get down to 7 or below.\" Ms. D: \"That's right. I am so f rustra ted about my weight. I think I need some more help to be successful. I want to avoid having to take more medication to get that number down.\" Doctor W: \"Ok. I am hearing that your preference rig ht now is to work on your weight. I can help you with that and we can hold off for now on recommending an increase in increase your medication.\" Ms. D: \"Thanks. Do you have any recommendations a bout what else I could do?\"Doctor W: \"Sure, though I would like to hea r your idea s, too.\" Ms. D: \"Well, I read recently that exercise is very important, but that you have to exercise for an hour a day to actua lly lose weight and keep it off. An hour a day just seems impossible f or me.\" Doctor W: \"It's great that you' re seeking out the latest information. Though an hour a day is linked to sustained weight loss, the hour of activity can be broken up into multiple bouts of activity over the co urse of a day. Also, shooting f or an hour a day when you are just getting started is too difficult for most people.\" Ms. D: \"You mean I can start out slow and work up to an hour a day?\" Doctor W: \"Absolutely. It is usually best to set a more modest goal to start. What do you think is a realistic starting goal for you?\" Discussion: In the above dialog, D octor W asked Ms. D . about her preferences for a goal. They negotiated, and D octor W said she wa s willing to hold f urther increases in Ms. D 's medications while agreeing on Ms. D 's choice to work on a weight management through increased physical activity. Once physical activity was chosen, Dr. W continued to help Ms. D . to choose a realistic and measurable short-\u00adterm goa l. Assist Help patients develop action stra tegies, and help them identify and overc ome barriers to implementation. When the required actions are extensive, complex, or completely unfa miliar, bring in an expanded clinica l team. Set new goals if confidence is too low. After patients have chosen a goal, your role shifts to assisting in development of a specific, realistic pla n to achieve it. Just as with setting goals, active problem-\u00adsolving to make a coherent and feasible pla n works be st when patients identify a resource or strategy themselves.(32 ) Exploring pa st experience with change ma y help patients identify strategies that were previously successful, at least partially or temporarily. In a ddition, identifying wha t went wrong a fter a period of success may clarify strategies toward a more durable result. If patients have high convict ion but low co nfidence, focus on discovering stra tegies to enhance confidence or self -\u00adefficacy. Identifying an d overcoming barriers to success is another importa nt aspect of this process. Exploration of resources within the patients' families, social network, and environment ma y uncover valuable supports. You may enlist an extended team member to teach specif ic coping and self-\u00admanagement skills, or strategize a ppropriate \"baby steps\".(29 ,47) If you work in a multidisciplinary team, the burden of education, counseling and skills training may be shared among several clinicians. Alternatively, you may decide to ref er patients to counseling professiona ls or services outside of your practice (e.g., telephone counseling programs, self-\u00ad management progra ms) (See also the discussion of the Chronic Ca re Model below.) Before you close a session, assess patients' confidence to implement the plan. If patients' confidence ratings are less than 7, they are less likely to succeed. If confidence is low, consider: 1) continuing to identify a nd resolve barriers until patients' confidence is at least 7; or 2) identifying a more limited goal that patients believe they can achieve, with a confidence rating of at least 7.

I will have to ask him to be pa tient with me.\" Dr. W: \"It is f ine to start out at a leisurely pa ce. Eventua lly, to promote weight loss, you will want to move up to a moderate pace......a pace that produces a light sweat, but is slow enough so you can ca rry on a conversation. I ca n have Mary teach you to take your pulse too, if you are interested in getting more precise feedback about the level of activity tha t will help you to meet your goal of losing weight.\" Ms. D: \"Maybe I can work on taking my pulse another time. Keeping track of my level of exertion seems fine to me.\" Dr. W: \"That's f ine...any other barriers?\" Ms. D: \"No, I ca n't think of any. Dr. W: \"Ok, we have a plan. Would you like to review the plan with me?\" Ms. D: \"Sure....let's see...I will walk for 20 minutes, 3 times a week, in my neighborhood a fter dinner, with my husband. I will start at a leisurely pace and gradually try to increase it. \" Dr. W: \"Ex cellent! So, how confident are you tha t you can implement your plan, onthat scale of 0 - 10, where 0 is not at all confident a nd 10 is extremely confident?\" Ms. D: \"9. I could proba bly say 10, but I usually don' t give 10s.\" Dr. W: \"Fair enough. Here is your copy of the plan.\" Assist: low co nviction o r low co nfidence Pressing on towa rd plans f or undertaking change with patients who a re uncertain about their NEED to change or their A BILITY to do so annoys and sometimes even infuriates both clinicians and pa tients, a nd guarantees a \"no change\" outcome. People need both strong conviction and at least a modicum of confidence before they will invest energy in learning how to change. For patients who reject the idea of change (e.g., conviction=0-\u00ad 1, precontemplation), return to the Assess, Advise and Agree steps. Evidence suggests that it may help to continue exploring patients' experience, belief s and feelings to better understand their low level of conviction. Experts call this \"ro ll wit h resist ance.\" Asking about their ra ting, f or example, \"What makes it a 1 and not 0\" or even, \"Zero...tha t's as low as you can g et...wha t would have to happen to make it a 1?\" may provide an opportunity to apprecia te or af firm their insight by saying \"So, I see that you realize there are some potential benefits to change\". Your recommendation (\"advice\") might be to -\u00adwith permission-\u00ad suggest tha t patients read information, talk with people who have changed, discuss the behavior with a partner or family member, or simply monitor their beha vior so a s to discuss their feelings and the eff ects with you at a f ollowing visit. If your patient agrees to one of these limited steps, you can then develop a specific plan to achieve the goal. Many patients in general medical settin gs -\u00ad data suggest tha t the percentage is about 60 -\u00ad are thinking about change, but a mbivalent (in contemplation). They have low (but not as low as 0-\u00ad1) conviction OR low confidence. For these patients you ma y give clear advice-\u00adwith permission-\u00ad but refrain from prematurely suggesting action plans or trying to persuade them. Consider talking about their conviction score and then eliciting and discussi ng the pros and cons of change, or exploring the rea sons they think they cannot succeed and then problem-\u00adsolving with them. In short, shift the focus f rom trying to induce change to trying to enhance conviction and confidence. To argue, to persuade or to \"predict calamity\" about changing something that patients either do not believe in or feel hopeless about is f rustrating and fruitless. Letting go of the illusion of clinician \"control\" and broa dening the perspective to elicit, explore and include the patient's feelings, belief s and concerns creates new opportunities for finding common ground. More information on these skills is in the Appendix, (\"For advanced clinicia ns\"), and in Do cCom Modules 24,25,29,30 (on smoking, alcohol and drugs, nutrition and exercise). Arrange follow up Arrange scheduled visits and arrange for patients to make appointments for consultants, educa tion classes, mutual help groups, and so on. The essential final component of the five \"A's\" is arranging f ollow-\u00adup visits, calls, and other continuing clinical conta ct, such a s education classes, counselor and consultant visits, or rehabilitation programs. When arranging f ollow-\u00adup contacts, be specif ic about dates and times, and help patients arrange the details f or following through with a ppointments. Adopt and maintain a long-\u00adterm perspective when managing patients with chronic illness or addressing long-\u00adstanding risky health behaviors. Evidence from the resea rch literature on chroniccare mana gement and health behavior change indicates that patients need multiple planned contacts to achieve the best outcomes. (7 ,22,41,49,50) Follow-\u00adup is important even when patients are in precontemplation or contempla tion and not ready undertake change. B rief advice, even during single contacts, can tip the balance for patients, some of whom go on to make important and lasting behavior change. (9 ,22,23,41)) Stra tegies f or success at closing visits and arranging follow up are in Do cCom module 12.

Brief Motivational Interviewing F. Integration of 5 A' s and Cronic Care Model A. Chro nic Care / Self -\u00ad Management The Chronic Care Model (CCM), developed by Edward Wa gner and collea gues at the MacCollInstitute for Healthcare Innova tion, has emerged as a tool for understanding a nd harnessing forces that influence the delivery and qua lity of care to patients with chronic illnesses.(48-\u00ad52 ) The statedgoal of the CCM is to create a n environment tha t supports \"productive interactions\" between \"informed activated ) (see figure 2 below) \"Self-\u00admanagement support\" occupies a key position in the CCM, emphasizing that patients with a chronic condition must manage their own illness every day between health care visits. Self-\u00admanagement support is defined a s a patient-\u00adcentered, colla borative a pproach that promotes patient empowerment. (50,52,53) The elements of self-\u00admanagement support include: 1) Assessment of beliefs, behavior and knowledge; 2) Collaborative goal setting; 3) Identification of personal barriers a nd supports; 4) Problem-\u00adsolving; and 5) Developing a personal action plan that is based on the previous 4 steps. (7) Figure 2: Model for Improving Chronic Illness Care In addition to \"Self-\u00adManagement Support\", the CCM specifies f ive other fa ctors tha t influence \"productive interactions\" between patients and clinicia ns: 1) delivery system design (e.g., pla nned regular visits for patients with chronic illness, f ollow-\u00adup telephone contact f or patients making a behaviora l change; 2) decision support (e.g., care guidelin es available at the point of care, clinician training; 3) information systems (e.g., patient registries, computerized reminder systems for patients and clinicians; 4) overall organization of health care (e.g., leadership); a nd 5) community linkages and resources.(48-\u00ad50 ) (see figure 2 above) The CCM is compatible with other models of patient-\u00adcentered care.(1 ,54,55 ). B. Co mmunicat self-\u00ad management Roter and Kinmonth reviewed self -\u00admanagement interventions in diabetes ca re, (8 ) and found evidence supporting principles that promote effective patient-\u00adcentered interactions. 1. Explore and Hear the Patients Perspective 2. Provide Emotional Support and Express Empathy 3. Provide Useful and Relevant Information 4. Negotiate a Plan 5. Anticipate Problems and Barriers and Identify Potential Solutions 6. Offer Ongoing Monitoring of Adherence a nd Adherence D ifficultiesTable 3: Principles of Eff ective Communication (Modif ied from (8 )) These principles may be applied across a va riety of medical conditions a nd pa tient populations. The patient-\u00adcentered and collabora tive nature of these principles emphasize understanding patients' experience and showing empathy, negotiating goals and helping patients to identify a nd overcome barriers. These principles are echoed in other reviews about promoting self-\u00ad management and health behavior change (7,9,30,47,56-\u00ad58 ) C. So cial Co gnitive Theory Social Co gnitive Theory (also known a s Social Lea rning Theory) posits that behavior change and its maintenance depend uponare a f unction of an individual's: 1) outcome expectations (i.e., belief s about what might happen outcomes could result f rom engaging in a behavior); and 2) efficacy expectations (self-\u00adef ficacy) (i.e.,( belief s about ability to how capable or confident one is of performing specific the behaviors in specific situations).(28 ,29) Said more simply, one's beliefs about the likelihood of an outcome and one' s feelings of confidence about achieving an outcome are strong determinants of that outcome. Thus, interventions that increase a person' s self-\u00adefficacy will improve behaviora l outcomes. This might include(e.g., skills training with an opportunity to practice in real-\u00adworld settings.) will improve behavioral outcomes. Another p rinciple of Social Cognitive Theory, Reciprocal determinism, another principle of Social Cognitive Theory, holds that personal factors, behavior, and the environment interact in such a way there is a reciprocal interaction between personal factors, behavior, and the environment such that any change in any one of these elements has an influences on the others, \"reciprocally\". ThusFor exa mple, success resulting from a new behavior, such a s a behavior (e.g using a relaxation stra tegy to avoid smoking) may increase self-\u00adef ficacy, which will then improves one's subsequent the ability to maintain smoking abstinence f rom smoking. The environment exerts a n many eff ects on behavior in a variety of ways, including modeling, a powerf ul determinant of behavior change. Thus, repeated exposure to positive role models, such as peers with ef fective coping repertoires, promotes adoption of healthy behaviors. Self-\u00addeterminatio n theory is a theory of human motiva tion that distinguishes between motivations tha t are autonomous versus \"controlled\" by others (such as \"orders\" from clinicians). (30) Carefully designed and controlled studies show that autonomous, or interna l, motivation is associated with improved better adherence and improvements in diabetes ca re. (30 ,31) Moreover, clinicians who support patient a utonomy a nd offer advice and treatment options \"without pressure or demand\" in a non-\u00adcontrolling, non-\u00ada uthoritarian way promote enhanced adherence and health behavior change. (30 ,31) D. Mo tivatio nal Int erviewing (MI) Motivatio nal Int erviewing (MI) was developed by psychologists William Miller and Stephen Rollnick a s an intervention targeting problema tic alcohol and substa nce use. However, MI is increasingly being applied to other behaviors, including counseling to prevent HIV infection (32,33,59), diabetes (64), weight management / obesity(65), and anxiety disorders(66,67). This type of counseling is compatible with the models noted above, and relies on elicita tion of patient belief s, amplification of any positive inclina tions towards cha nging a behavior and helping patients take charge of their change process. is an approach to patient counseling tha t is compatible with all the models noted above. Rollnick a nd Miller have defined Motivationa l Interviewing as a collabora tive, patient-\u00adcenteredapproach to interviewing a nd counseling in which the role of the practitioner is to evoke from patients their own reasons (that is, \"motivation\") f or making a change in behavior, rather than to impose the practitioner' s ideas about what patients should do. Helping patients to articulate their own values and goals can be a powerf ul motivator for change, especially when values they espouse a re contra sted with their current behavior. The process of evoking values and rea sons necessarily requires active listening by clinicians. Active listening creates communicative space (68) by asking open-\u00adended questions, of fering apprecia tive comments, and ref lecting back to the patient brief summaries of what we understand the patient to be saying. Genera lly, asking open ended questions about values a nd beliefs and restating patients' answers (reflective listening) makes patients more likely to state their reasons for changing or not changing. Miller calls these patient statements \"ch ange talk,\" and change talk in turn fa cilitates patients' choosing to make a behavior change. Hearing their own \"change talk\" strengthens patients' internal motivations a nd encourages movement in the direction of change. Other techniques for understanding motivations include eliciting what patients like a nd do not like about a current behavior (review the pros and cons) and using an importance/conf idence scale, the answers to which f acilita te patients' talk about their readiness to undertake change. \"On a scale from 0 to 10, how important is it for you to quit smoking? On that same scale, how confident a re you that you can quit smoking?\" Suppose the clinician reflects, \"I hear that you want to be alive and healthy for your grandchildren.\" An example of patient change talk might be, \"Well, I di d quit smoking for a while after my hip surgery.\" Clinicians' tendency is to point out unhealthy behaviors and tell patients what they should be doing instea d. This is the \"righting ref lex\"-\u00ad\"You really should stop smoking or else you are going to have another heart attack.\" Clinicians who respond to patients who are ambivalent about changing their behavior with a \"righting ref lex\" statement typicall y and quite routinely cause patients to \"defend\" their current behavior. (\"But... I' m under a lot of stress right now and smoking is my only stress reliever.\") Thus, succumbing to the righting reflex may solidify resistance to change. If instead, clinicians resist the righting ref lex by being curious, empathic, and supportive, they provide patients a potential space to verbalize a ny reasons for change that already exist within them. This can tip the balance in f avor of cha nge by producing change talk, and creating space f or a continuing dialogue. Reflecting, \"It sounds as if you really f ind smoking relaxing, and that's what you feel you need right now,\" might be followed by, \"Yeah, but maybe there's a better way to deal with stress than smoking...\" Listen especially for \"commitment language,\" that is, statements that show that patients are ready to take steps toward changing (\"Starting tomorrow, I will quit smoking\"), a nd reflect it back, (\"Sounds like you have a first step in mind.\") Additionally, even if patients are not yet ready to take steps toward change, clinicians can support optimism and hope by stating our belief that they can change.The \"RULE\" mnemonic describes f our principles tha t underlie the MI approach to engaging patients in a back-\u00adand-\u00adf orth dialogue rather than a prescriptive monologue(67 ). 1. Resist the righting ref lex - avoid directing 2. Understand patients' motivations - explore meaning, goals and values 3. Listen to patients - respond with empa thy 4. Empo wer patients to make change - support self-\u00adef ficacy Table 4: Principles of Motivational Interviewing (From (67 )) When clinicians use the steps outlined above, any change patients make is \"autonomous,\" or \"self-\u00addetermined.\" In summary, clinicians engage patients in a facilita tive dialogue; guiding patients in a process tha t research shows more often produces sustained change than moredirective or prescriptive approa ches. E. Brief Mo tivatio nal Int erviewing Brief versions of Motivational Interviewing have been developed for use by clinicians in prima ry care and other health care settings [33,34,62,67 ]. They emphasize that progress can be made in brief interviews, and review simple strategies to build rapport (i.e., open-\u00adended inquiry, reflective listening and empathy), to assess patients' stage of change, and to ask a bout (1) conviction or importance regarding the need for change; and (2) conf idence or self -\u00adefficacy a bout taking a ction. Clinicians ca n tailor counseling and use specific stra tegies that seek to foster and increa se patients' levels of conviction and confidence. As a general rule, if both conviction and confidence a re low, investigators suggest that it is most efficient to focus on enhancing conviction first. After all, most patients have to believe it is important to change or adhere before they will be willing to invest energy in learning how to change. Brief act ion planning (B AP) is a motivational interviewing-\u00adbased communication tool developed by Steven Cole a nd others (www.CentreCMI.ca ) that is designed to support self-\u00admanagement a nd motivate adaptive beha vior change. The B AP suggests exploration of following core questions: 1. \"Is there anything you would like to do for your health in the next week or two?\" (what, when, where, how often, etc?) 2. \"On a 0-\u00ad10 scale of confidence, were 0 mea ns no confidence and 10 means a lot of confidence, about how confident are you tha t you will be able to carry out your plan?\" (If confidence <7, initiate collaborative problem-\u00adsolving.) These explora tions often result in questions that can be f ollowed up by a menu of options for treatment and follow-\u00adup; outlining development of specif ic, measurable steps toward change (e.g., reducing the number of cigarettes smoked per day or using condoms some of the time); eliciting elicitation of a commitment statement f rom the patient; and collaborative problem-\u00adsolving and follow-\u00adup. Patients not ready to commit to any a ction towards cha nge may be encouraged to continue to think a bout the possibilities for change while being told that help is available when they are ready to take a ction. For patients with low confidence, strategies include: reviewing past experience, especially successes; teaching problem-\u00adsolving and coping skills; and encouraging small steps that are likely to lead to initial success.

Figure 2: The Chronic Care Model If you ref erence the complete Chronic Care Model shown in Figure 2, you are reminded that self -\u00ad management support is but one of several elements within the level of the health care organization that interact synergistically to promote \"Productive Interactions\" between a \"Prepared Proactive Practice Team\" and an Inf ormed Activated Patient. Thus, improved health outcome s will be more broadly and deeply realized only when clinicians deliver eff ective patient-\u00adcentered health behavior counseling (Tables 3, 4, and 5 ) within a context of ca re that includes all of the key elements of the Chronic Care Model.Appendix 2: Additio nal tables and figures In this section you'll f ind the following tables / f igures: 1.

What role do patients want to play in decision making? 3. How do I determine how much involvement my pa tients want? 4. How do I promote patients' involvement in clinical decision making? Key Principles: 1. Ethics:Shared decision making arises from the dual ethical principles of benef icence and respect for autonomy: the clinician has a n ethica l obligation to provide best clinica l advice and judgmentwhile off ering pa tients a meaningful role in clinical decision making. 2. Informat ion: In order to become an informed participant in clinica l decision making, patients need adequate information about the nature of the clinical situation, alternatives, benefits and harms, and uncertainties, all in a manner which they can understand. 3. Invo lvement: The clinician should create an atmosphere that fosters patient involvement in decision making, encouraging questions and respecting divergent values and pref erences. 4. Partnership: The ultimate goal of shared decision making is to reach a decision that both the clinician and patient support. This is accomplished through mutual participation, so that the patient ga ins from the clinicia n's knowledge and judgment and the clinician learns the patients values and preferences. Learning go als: At the co nclusion o f this mo dule, yo u will be able to : list and describe the key elements of shared decision making describe the ethica l rationale for shared decision making involve your patients in clinical decision making explore your patients' desire f or a role in decision making foster your patients' informed pa rticipation in clinica l decision making. EVOLUTION OF CONCEPT OF SHARED DECISION-\u00ad MAKING Recent acceleration in medical science a nd research left patients and potential resea rch subjects with limited understanding of facts and potential implica tions of decisions about their health. A Presidential commission addressed these issues and articulated both the ethics and the process of getting people more involved with their own health. Science and technology advanced at a rapid pace in the past f ew decades. Understanding information releva nt to decisions about health became increasingly difficult for the lay public, and particularly for patients faced with the need to decide in situations that were urgent or carried lifelong implications. In the early 1980' s a Presidenti al Advisory Panel convened to address some of the complexity introduced by the rapid advance in knowledge and technology. This panel, on informed consent in health care and research, introduced the phrase \"shared decision-\u00admaking.\" They advised: Ethically valid consent is a process of sha red decision-\u00admaking based upon mutual respect and participation, not a ritual to be equated with reciting the content s of a form that details the risks of a particular treatment. (1 )Shared decision-\u00admaking a cknowledges patients' central role in making decisions about their own health care. The clinician's primary role is to make health care recommendations based on the desire to promote patients' well-\u00adbeing. The clinician's second obliga tion is to help patients obtain and understand the information relevant to a particular health decision, and to f acilita te their active participation in making the most informed decision possible. We emphasize that the clinician' s obligation goes beyond a unilateral disclosure of risks a nd benef its, and includes the specific intention to foster patient understanding, as well as targeted interventions to accomplish this intention. CONCEPT OF SHARED DECISION-\u00adMAKING DERIVES FROM FUNDAMENTAL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES The ethica l principles of respect f or persons, respect for autonomy, and promotion of patient well-\u00adbeing (beneficence) form the f ounda tion for the concept of shared decision-\u00admaking. The interactional and communica tion processes that drive the implementa tion of the concept derive from these ethica l principles. The principle of respect for persons derives from the view that people are va luable in their own right. Thus, clinicians have an obligation to show respect f or the intrinsic value of each individual. One wa y in which the clinici an ca n show respect is by fostering the meaningful participation of patients in decision-\u00admaking. The concept of autonomy is central to Western ethica l traditions. An expression of respect f or autonomy in the clinical context involves acknowledging and supporting patients' right to make decisions that affect their bodies. The principle of promotion of patient well-\u00adbeing, of ten called benef icence, is a central tenet of clinica l medicine. A s clinicians, we a re guided by a professional obligation to use our knowledge and skills to evaluate patient concerns and make recommenda tions f or beneficial health care interventions.In some situations, you and your patients may define \"benefit\" substantially dif ferently. Using the example of blood pressure control, medication side ef fects may af fect quality of lif e so much that patients no longer perceive any net benef it. The purpose of shared decision-\u00admaking is to facilitate patients' role in determining the meaning of \"benef it\" in their own heath care decisions. THE PATIENT'S ROLE Most pa tients want information, but some patients want clinicians to make important decisions for them, a nd some patients will defer to family. A sk your patients about their prefer ences. In general 70-\u00ad80% of patients, when asked their preference for involvement in decision making, express a desire to be informed a nd to have a say in the choice of medical treatment. (2,3,4 ) Nevertheless, some patients may be reluctant to participate, either because they truly would rather delegate decision making authority to the clinician, or because they simply f eel overwhelmed or unaccustomed to the task. Hence it is important to inquire about the patient' s preference for a role in decision making. Checking regularly with patients will help you ascertain that you are not overburdenin g them with complex explanations, statements laden with medical jargon, or excessive detail in discussions of alternatives, risks, benef its, or uncertainties, and insures that your dialog is both relationship-\u00adcentered a nd efficient. (see module 10)Among patients of other cultural backgrounds, the default preference for involvement in decision making may not hold true. Rather, there may be traditions of allowing other family members to make decisions, or to withhold certain information on diagnosis and prognosis f rom the patient. Remain open to those patients who have a different view of how clinical decisions should be made. Additionally, do not make assumptions about patients' desired level of involvement, ask them. Inviting pat ient invo lvement Balance your invitation, help patients understand wha t you mean, and encourage patients to think out loud. Many patients are not accustomed to playing a role in clinical decision making. Patients may worry that you will be off ended if they ask too many questions or seem to question your opinion or advice. They may a lso feel overwhelmed by the medical information, and embarrassed to a dmit this to you. For these reasons, talk with patients about the ways in which you will support and enable them to have a meaningful role. As you talk, balance your encouragement, so tha t you neither force involvement, and nor inadvertently discoura ge a role. \"You need to be involved with this decision,\" may be too forcef ul. \"You could also be a part of this decision,\" may suggest that you don't really want them involved. The best metaphor for encouraging the pa tient's involvement is to think of it as an invitation: \"I really want to give you a chance to share your thoughts about this too.\" \"People differ in how much they want to be pa rt of making choices about their medical care. How much do you like to be involved?\" In some instances, it may even be helpf ul to ask patients about their pref erred decision-\u00ad making style in a f ormal way. One tool that can help is the Control Pref erence Scale. This simple, one-\u00ad page form uses simple cartoons and pla in language to prompt patients to select their generally preferred style of decision making, from active, active shared, collaborative, passive shared, and passive. Even with such a n invitation, some patients may be quite uncertain what your intentions a re, or what you wa nt from them. One technique that ca n help is to suggest that patients \"think a loud.\" \"What are you thinking right now?\" If they can make their thinking transparent to you, you gain insight into their level of understanding, potentially f inding key areas you ca n clarify. You can a lso uncover areas that you have not yet discussed, such as specific worries this patient might have. Addressing the se concerns f oster both patients' understanding and their level of comfort with the decision. FRAMEWORK AND SKILLS TO FOLLOW UP AN INVITATION A general framework and a few associated skills enable clinicians to partner with patients in making personalized decisions about situations. Many patients will accept your invitation to actively collaborate about important decisions. Patients' need for informatio n and their ability to handle it, the medical complexity of the information youseek to help them understand a nd the urgency, importance a nd meaning of the situation vary tremendously. Is this a prevention discussion with a highly educated patient (\"Your cholesterol is high,\") an urgent surgical situa tion for who speaks little English (\"Your inf ected gallbla dder should be taken out now,\") a proxy decision with a very worried parent (\"Your baby is very jaundiced and needs hospitaliza tion,\") or a simple matter with a retail clerk (\"I do not think you need an anti biotic for your cold\")? Having a general framework in mind to remind you of the relevant elements and their associated skills enables you to flexibly handle this array of everyday situations competently, eff iciently a nd in a personalized f ashion that respects each person. The elements that you will include in your shared decision making conversa tions a ppear in the following list: Invite patients to participate Describe the nature of the decision that patients face Delinea te alternative courses of action that could be taken Describe releva nt information about the pros & cons of a lternatives Present information about uncertainties inherent in the situation Assess patients' understanding Ascertain patients' preferences for action Adjust your intervent ions to the situatio ns' complexity Dialog will be longer or shorter, and the completeness with which you carry out the steps will vary according to your relationship with patients, their past experience with related decisions and the complexity of the situation. Clearly the extent of dialogue necessary to foster informed participation wi ll vary. Additional factors influencing the dia logue needed would be the length of your relationship with a patient, the patient' s experience with prior similar decisions a nd his or her cognitive ability. Importantly, the nature and complexity of the decision will strongly impact the extent of discussion. (5) For some decisions of low complexity, only an abbreviated discussion is needed, letting the patient know what you would like to do and asking them if that will be all right. Some level of discussion of the nature of the decision is always necessary, such as, \"I' d like to order a blood count to make sure you're not anemic.\" For many such basic decisions, there will be minimal if any \"risk,\" and the alternatives are ra ther limited, such as not ordering a blood count. Thus it is not crucial to routinely discuss these elements. The conversation should, however, leave open the door for patient questions or concerns, such that when the discussion is complete, patients have their information needs met. For basic decisions, this can be accomplished by merely asking, f or instance, \"Does tha t sound all rig ht?\" The typical very complex example is a surgical procedure, in which there is substantial risk and clear alternatives. Here the need for explora tion is greater. For the most complex decisions, explicit discussion of alternatives, risks and benef its, and a full exploration of the patient's level of understanding a nd their opinion would be essential. Many decisions, such as prescribing a new medicatio n, may need a level of discussion intermediate to these two extremes. For some decisions, the amount and complexity of information may be so extensive that it is difficult to convey in a single clinical encounter. A decision aid can help in these instances. Adecision aid is a resource - booklet, D VD, video, or website - that provides inf ormation in a format and depth that is easily a ccessible. D ecision aids have been shown to improve the qua lity of shared decision making, and an increasing number of decision aids are available for common conditions and decisions. Useful skills fo r these co nversat ions Learning key skills a nd practicing them increases trust and satisfaction through f ostering a successful sha red decision making process. Phra ses simila r to those below effectively convey your intention, the mea ning of the situation and your personal concern that patients get what they want and need. Your invit ation to patients \"This is really a decision we should make tog ether\" \"It will be important to me to hear your thoughts about this too.\" Descript ion of the nature of the decisio n A clear statement of what is at issue helps clarify what is being decid ed upon and allows clinicians to share their preliminary thoughts. \"What we need to decide is...\" \"The issue f or us today is...\" Delineat ing alt ernatives A decision always has options, including the option of doing nothing at all. Taking a moment to make this explicit insures better patient understanding of the situation. \"You could try the new medication or continue the medication you are taking .\" Descri ption of the pro s and cons-\u00ad benefit s and risks Clinicians f requently present the pros of one option and the cons of a nother, without f ully exploring the pros and cons of each. A more balanced presentation a ssures that patients' decisions will be better inf ormed. In addition to clinica l impacts of the proposed intervention, it's important to address the real-\u00adworld, functional implications. For example, the patient contemplating insulin therapy might worry about how they could incorporate insulin administration into their work or social life. Your proactive inquiry about these concerns may remove a barrier to patient acceptance of a beneficial treatment. \"The new medication is more expensive. But you only need to take it once a day.\" \"Let's talk about how this might a ffect Prese nt informatio n abo sometimes difficult, a discussion of uncerta inties is crucial for the patient's comprehensive understanding a bout the options. Thoughtf ul discussion can promote trust and encourage compliance. \"There is a good chance that this will help you.\" \"This works well for most patients.\" \"There is a small chance - maybe 1 out of 20 -\u00ad of infection f rom this.\" Assess pat ients' underst anding Once the core inf ormation is provided and core disclosures are made, clinicians must check in with patients to know if what they have said so f ar makes sense. As emphasized above, f ostering understanding is the central goal of shared decision making.\"Do you follow where I am going with this?\" \"Does what I say make sense to you?\" \"Are you with me so fa r?\" Sometimes it is important to delve more deeply into the patient's grasp of the dimensions of a decision, particularly so f or a complex decision. In such instances, the use of questions that encourage the patient to share their understanding of the decision can be very helpful. This approach is often called the \"teach-\u00adback:\" \"I know we' ve cov ered a lot, and I want to make sure I did a good job of expla ining. It would help if you could repeat what you understood me to say.\" Ascertain pat ient preferences fo r next steps Experience demonstrates that many patients need encouragement to actually state an opinion, particularly if they disagree with clinicians' initial recommendations. A common clinician error with serious consequences is to assum e that silence means that patients do not disagree, a nd \"consent\" to your plan. Patients who disagree and do not say so are less likely to adhere to decisions, and (for example,) may not show up for their scheduled consultation or biopsy, increasing costs, adding delays and unnecessary frustration and ineff iciencies Make certain that your patients know that you wish to air any disagreements and tha t you will listen and explore possible alternatives graciously, including giving them more time to consider their options, consult their loved ones, a nd so on. \"Does tha t sound ok with you?\" \"What do you think?\" \"What would seem like the right course of action?\" \"How do you f eel about that?\" EXAMPLES OF SHARED DECISION MAKING Complexit y of decisio nPoor exampleBetter example Basic: obtaining a complete blood count\"I'd like to check some blood tests.

CONCLUSION The goal of shared decision making is to foster patients' informed participation in decisions about their health. Shared decision -\u00admaking rests on the ethical principles of respect for persons and autonomy and promotion of patient well-\u00adbeing. Evidence in the medical literature shows that involving patients in decision making promotes trust and satisfaction a nd contributes to better clinical outcomes. Severa l recent studies confirm that most patients would prefer a role in decision making. D o not make assumptions about your patien ts' desired level of involvement. Remain open to those patients who have a different view of how clinica l decisions should be made. To practice shared decision-\u00adma king effectively, clinicians need both a f ramework to guide such discussions and the communication skills to implement these conversations. Key elements of shared decision making include: invite pa tients to participate; describe the decision; delineate alternatives; describe pros & cons of a lternatives; present inf ormation about uncertainties; assess patients' understanding; and ascertain patients' preferences. Clinical decisions vary in complexity, from very simple to extremely complex; therefore,discussions about decisions will va ry greatly depending both on the patient and the complexity of the issue.

INTRODUCTION: EVIDENCE ABOUT SEXUALITY IN MEDICAL PRACTICE Evidence shows that inquiry about sexuality and sexual beha vior, as well as examinations of breasts, rectum and genitals remain problematic for many clinicians. In addition, clinicians' opportunitie s to talk about their clinical experiences with the topic of sexuality, their own sexuality and sexual f eelings in the practice of medicine, a re limited. These problems may greatly diminish the quality of patients' care. You've just taken over Dr. Smith's practice and are seeing a long-\u00adterm patient for blood pressure management. The patient is very f riendly, and comments on your clothing, your new office d\u00e9cor and the fact that you do not wear a wedding ring. You notice that the blood pressure medication was changed last visit because it wa s causing sexual dysfunction; your a nxiety rises as you anticipate that you' ll need to do a sexua l history. Focus groups reveal that patients pref er that their clinician initiate any discussion about sexual f unctioning. The Survey on Sexuality in Nursing Practice (SSNP) found that only 12% of nurses addressed sexuality with their clients even though the nurse/subjects consistently identified sexuality as a necessa ry part of nursing practice. Emergency room clinicia ns and Nurse Practitioners, even when prompted by a computer screening progra m that indicates a patient is at risk, or is currently a victim of intimate partner violence (including sexual abuse), rarely inquire about the details of the abuse A study of screening f or HIV risk demonstra ted that many practitioners encountered \"awkward moments\" with their patients in their discussions of risky sexual practices that limited the accuracy and ef fectiveness of the screening. Many patients experience disruption of normal sexual a ctivity as a result of medication side effects, disruptions in fa mily functioning and psychological fears f ollowing surgery. Nearly 75% of older patients would like to discuss some a spect of sexual functioning with their clinicia n but less than 2% of primary care clinicia ns routinely ask their older patientsquestions about their sexual health. A study of women with GI compla ints found that a significant proportion ha d a history of early childhood sexual abuse that was undetected in previous medical encounters. Many medical students, residents and practicing clinicia ns can identify instances of sexual bounda ry confusion (e.g., feeling attracted to certain patients, not doing breast or genital exams on patients who are about their a ge) but do not have opportunities to discuss their feelings with colleagues. In this module we identify basic principles of taking the sexual history. We offer a framework f or appro aching the interview and some practical suggestions f or ways to normalize sexual history and make it a routine. Second, we focus on special situa tions, such as interviewing patients with STD 's, and chronic illnesses or situations that may lead to sexual problems. Third, we explore clinicia n sexuality and persona l issues that inhibit treating patients appropriately. PRINCIPLES OF SEXUAL HISTORY TAKING In this section, we'll cover the following: When t o ask abo ut sex? At what point in the encounter should you initiate conversations about sex a nd sexual function? What is the most respectful way to ask abo ut sex? Learn the health reasons f or asking about sex, the questions you will need, and helpful transition statements. What questio ns should I ask? Introduction to recommended questions for the routine sexual history. How can I respectfully explo re details and the co ntext of sexual issues? Learn the best strategy to get more details about sexua lity or sexua l functioning in this or in a subsequent visit. Talking to patients abo ut HIV/AIDS o r STDs Stigma and guilt are associated with HIV and other STDs and with beha viors a ssociated with transmission of these diseases. Talking abo ut sex aft er patients' surgery, o r with tho se who have chro nic illnesses Learn to anticipate the fear and symbolic effects of surgery in conversations with patients before surgery occurs. Talking with t eenagers abo ut sexuality, STDs and pregnancy Learn what teenagers need in order to have conversations about sex with a medical professiona l. When t o ask abo ut sex As a medical professiona l you should be the one to initiate conversations about sex and sexual f unction. Certain types of interviews, such a s comprehensive evaluations, expressed concern about a ny aspect of genitourinary function, or expressed sexual concerns call formore explora tion in the domainof sexuality. Evidence suggests that many patients have questions about their sexua l functioning that they would like to discuss with their clinician. Like other sensitive topics, (living wills, costs, etc.), patients strongly pref er that the conversa tion be initiated by the clinician. Patients are unlikely to bring these topics up spontaneously. During any visit tha t includes past medical history, social history a nd systems review you will ask questions about sexual health and function routinely, just as you ask about alcohol, drugs, relationships and other sensitive topics. In less comprehensive visits, you will a sk these questions when the \"present illness\" rela tes in any way to genitourinary f unction (including possible pregna ncy), when sexua lly transmitted inf ections are a consideration, or when you had rec ently started patients on medications that may impair sexual f unctioning. Of course, you will a ddress all aspects of sexual health and function whenever the patient' s visit is precipitated by a sexual concern or problem. Some patients will refer indirectly or obliquely to questions about sexual f unctioning. For example, a patient recently put on medication for high blood pressure may ask in general t erms about side effects or express concerns about physical activity. Of ten Ask a follow up question to ascertain whether the patient is worried about sexual f unction, a nd attend carefully to the non-\u00adverbal aspects of the communica tion. What is the most respect ful way to ask abo ut sex? Learn the health reasons f or asking about sex, the usual questions you will need, and helpf ul transition stateme nts. Social scientists point out that sexual mores differ from culture to culture, sometimes making it difficult to discern the limits of propriety and decency. For exa mple, it would be very unusual for a woman to see a male clinician about her sexual health in ma ny cultures. Likewise, displaying parts of the body such as the soles of one's feet is considered the equivalent of \"exposing oneself \" in some cultures. Understanding that norms dif fer, even within your own culture, is important in your providing a safe context f or talk a bout sexual health and functioning. Your ease in taking a sexual history is related to your own level of comfort with this portion of the visit. Learning the typical a nd appropriate questions, and becoming clear about why you are asking about sexuality are important steps you ca n take to reduce your own anxieties in this situation. Just as you learned to listen to the heart and eventually were able to detect subtle signs through repeated exposure, practice is the most important key to competence in this arena. Most pa tients apprecia te that questions about sex may provoke some tension or embarrassment (particularly f or student learners), and a transition statement such as, \"Now I' m going to ask you some questions about your sexual health,\" and, \"These are questions I ask all patients and are important for your health,\" usually readies both you and your patient to discuss this material. What questio ns sho uld I ask? Below are recommended questions f or the routine sexual history. Usually, clinicians ask about sexuality during the psychosocial history. Some questio ns should be routine, others asked if patients indicate that there are issues about their sexuality they would like to discuss.Check o ut the video example about \"taking the sexual history\" on the left. Routine quest ions: \"Is there someone special in your life? Are you and this person having sex?\" \"Are you satisfied with your sex life?\" Or, \"are there any problems or concerns about your sexual f unctioning that you' d like to discuss?\" Do you have other sexual partners? (are you monogamous, have multiple partners, casual partners)? \"It's important that I a sk some questions to assess your risk of sexually transmitted diseases or HIV: Have you been having any high risk sex? (injection drug users, cocaine users, prostitutes, gay or bisexual men)?\" \"Has your illness affected your sexual f unctioning ?\" Some experts recommend asking, \"Do you have sex with men, women, or both?\" However, frequently patients will tell you this information in answering the questions above. Attend to the timing of discussions of sexuality and sexual f unctioning. Ideally, the patient and provider should be seated comfortably and at ease. If using an electronic medical record, keep note taking to a minimum and give full visual and non-\u00adverbal attention to the patient. Sometimes when you ask patients if they have a ny sexual problems or concerns, they will answer \"no,\" but seem hesitant in their responses. Monitoring both verbal and non-\u00adverbal behavior to detect signs of anxiety or ambivalence about discussing sexually related problems. It ca n be helpf ul to notice that: \"You seem a little doubtful.\" \"I get the feeling that everything isn't so great.\" Many patients will then be encouraged to reveal their concerns. For some pa tients, a statement abou t confidentiality will be helpful, \"Everything we talk about will remain between you and me.\" Many sit uations will require that you ask more det ails, such as the questio ns below: \"Are you using condoms to prevent disease? What percent of the time? \"Do you have any other sexual relationships that I should know about?\" \"Do you have difficulty having an orgasm?\" \"Do you use any sexual performance enhancing medications (Viagra, so, how frequently?\" Gender-\u00adspecific questio ns: Men: Women: you have any developing or maintaining an erection?\"\"Do you have trouble ejaculating too soon, or not soon enough?\" (For men with erectile dysfunction): \"Do you ever get spontaneous erections? If so, are they norma l?\"\"Do you have any pain during intercourse?\" \"Do you have problems with lubrication?\" How can I respectfully explo re details and the co ntext of sexual issues? The best strategy to get more details is to tell patients tha t you would like to explore further with them, in this or in a subseq uent visit. Ma ny sexual issues involve the broader psychosocial context. Check o ut the video example about \"the context of sexual issues\" on the left. Often when patients bring up sexual problems, they are associated with other problems in their relationships or in their lives. Respectfully asking patients to say more, and simply listening to them often provides an opportunity for helpful ventilation of feelings, and for revealing information that will help you decide on next steps. It is critical to listen and respond non-\u00adjudgmentally a nd with empathy to these very sensitive issues. As you transition to exploring the context in which the problem is experienced, some closed a nd some open questions that will help you respectfully get important medical and contextual details are listed below: When did you first become aware of this problem? Has the problem occurred before? Does the problem occur a ll of the time or just some of the time? (If there are multiple partners,) does it occur with a ll partners or just some partners? What feelings does the problem raise in you? How has your partner(s) been responding? What have you tried to address to this problem? Has anyone tried to hurt you or force you to have sex now or in the past? Sometimes patients will share information about maladaptive behaviors. In those cases, provide a rationale f or continuing the conversation e.g., \"I' d like to talk with you (today/next time) about your having unprotected sex with men and women because it carries increased risk for sexually transmitted diseases a nd HIV infection.\" State tha t your interest is in their health risk; not in their sexual pref erences or life choices, a nd reinforce that a ny information shared will be conf idential. Be aware that further inquiry about mala daptive behavior in the moment may interrupt the patient from continuing the story and limit your understanding of what is going on in the patient's life. If you feel that you don't yet fully understand the context ofillness, simply f lag the issue for later discussion and encourage the patient to continue. Talking to patients abo ut HIV/AIDS o r STDS Stigma and guilt are associated with HIV and other STDs and with behaviors associated with transmission of these diseases. Clinicians a re not immune to related negative f eelings about the diseases or the behaviors. When clinicia ns' and patients' ambivalent or judgmental feelings collide, defensiveness, irritation and anger f requently surface. In most societ ies, sexually transmitted illnesses are shameful, a nd people who carry them are stigma tized, especia lly if the infections were acquired by disa pproved sexual activity (outside of marriage, or through anonymous homosexual or heterosexual encounters, f or example). For people with HIV/AID S or at risk of contracting it, a fear of having a drea ded disease contributes further to the complexity of interviews . Where there is shame, there is often guilt. This is certainly true f or patients with S TDS and HIV/AID S, particularly if the infection was contracted through behavior that goes against their moral or religious belief s. Check o ut the video example about \"embarassement and guilt\" on the left. This video is a n excerpt of a longer video from DocCom module 5. The clinician on camera is Auguste Fortin. Guilt may be stronger if the infected person is putting someone else a t risk because of the behavior, f or example, a man who contra cted HIV through IV drug use or sex with prostitutes, and is continuing to have unprotected se x with his wife. It is always a good idea to provide patients a chance to talk about their feelings(m 3, 6, 13) once the behavior and situa tion have been adequately understood; a nd this is never more true than when in dialogue with patients about HIV or other STD s. Because issues related to STDs and HIV are so sensitive, your questions must be framed in non-\u00ad judgmental language, a nd your non-\u00adverbal communications should be congruent, and neutral in tone. Many patients are already f earful of having HIV/AID S, even when the actual likelihood of being infected is unclear. While you ca n't change tha t probability by how you talk with patients, they are very sensitive to the nuances of your communications. Take extra steps to maintain a professional and objective stance, so that you avoid any implication that the probability is high, and avoid f rightening patients unnecessarily. Interviews a re also complicated because these diseases, the beha viors through which they are contracted, a nd the fact that they can be transmitted to \"innocent bysta nders\" bring clinicians' fears, ambivalence, or judgments to the surface. Whatever you ma y feel about someone who engages in such behavior, it is not helpful to convey your judgments. Come to terms with any evaluative feelings you have a bout these diseases and the associated behaviors. If you have not, then your non-\u00adverbal signa ls will convey the judgments that you feel. The patient will see your mixed message, and will correctly believe that your non verbal communication conveys the truth about how you feel. Sending mixed messages confuses patients and diminish es trust. Again, practice, f eedback and experience bring comfort and skill to your interviews about sex a nd sexual functioning. Talking abo ut sex aft er patients' surgery, o r with those who have chro nic illnesses Fear and symbolic effects of illness and surgery on sexuality usually cause patients more difficulty tha n physica l effects. Medications' effects on sexual f unction are diverse and f requent. Elicit details about the situation, and then explore feelings and relationships. As stressed earlier in this module, patients se ldom initiate conversations about sexuality, so clinicians should do so with chronically ill or post surgery pa tients, and those af fected by medications. Be sure you ask directly, \"how has this illness aff ected your sexual function?\" If there are problems, ask about the details, and explore the patient's emotions and the effects of the problem on the relationship. Chronic diseases and surgery affect se xuality in a number of ways, including mechanical (e.g., arthritis, surgical wounds), physiological (e.g., f atigue or shortness of breath), or direct (e.g., endocrine or neurological disorders.) More of ten overlooked are the effects of illness and surgery on self image and self esteem, and on a patients' sense of themselves as attractive, \"whole\", men or women. For example, a colostomy or disfiguring surgery may diminish the sense of body integrity and cause people to fear they're repellant to their pa rtner, while a woman who has just had a hysterectomy or mastectomy may worry about her identity and value as a woman. Myocardial infarctions and open heart surgery are frightening for both men and women, as they fear that sexua l activity may precipitate another heart a ttack or cause other damage. Rec all that for many patients the emotional a nd symbolic effects of illness or surgery are more powerful than the physical effects on sexuality. This commonly occurs following an MI or cardiac surgery that affects men' s sense of masculinity. Many drugs used for chronic illnesses can affect sexual f unction (usually desire, erection or arousal, or, primarily in women, orgasm). Additio nal int erviewing point s for these pat ients are the follo wing: Be aware that emotiona l and symbolic eff ects are usually more devastating than the more obvious physica l effects. Do not make assumptions, (for exa mple tha t a person with a disfiguring or debilitating illness is not interested in sex), inquire. Get specif ic and appropria tely detailed information about the beha viors a nd situation, and then ask about feelings. It may be awkward for young clinicians to ask about these details of sexual relations, but if you ask a bout them directly, patients will often answer directly. For example, does the patient with severe arthritis have diff iculty opening her hips, or bending her knees? Have she and her partner talked about alternative positions, and is he willing to try these? If there is a lack of excitement or desire, does this seem due to pain, or fatigue, both, or neither? And so on. Then you ca n and should ask how she' s feeling a bout the situation, how it's affecting the relationship with her husba nd, and what her worries or questions might be. Be especially vigilant about the eff ects of major life stressors such as divorce, re-\u00admarriage, or spousal or family health on sexual f unctioning; and about the relationship of such events to patients facing or undergoing surgery. Talking with t eenagers abo ut sexuality, STDs and pregnancy Teenagers need healthcare providers who are trustworthy, empathic listeners, a nd who give good practical advice. When interviewing adolescents and young adults, ensure and emphasize confidentiality, initiate the topic of sex, give advice and sexual information respectfully and without condescension, and pay particular attention to inquiry about sexual coercion or abuse. Check o ut the video example about \"interviewing a teen about sexuality\" on the left. Teenagers are working out who they are and sexuality is a big part of this process. However smart and sophisticated teens may seem, they are still developing the ability to make good decisions, balance risks and benef its, consider future consequences, and perform other \"executive functions\". Despite this immaturity and also because of it, teena gers react strongly to advice, even when it's thoughtful and well-\u00adintentioned. They a re sensitive to condescension, being treated like children, or being criticized. They tend to somewha t distrust adults, and\u2014of ten rightf ully so\u2014fear tha t what they tell clinicians will get back to their parents. Theref ore, the first rule is to ensure confidentiality. At the same time, most tee nagers respond positively if you convey a genuine interest in their experience and opinions, and a respect for the maturity they do have. It may be helpful to start with closed questions that help you get a clear sense of the behavior or situation, and then open the interview up for the patient to ask questions, or voice concerns. Keep in mind that most teena gers are embarrassed by talk about the deta ils of sexual behavior, so be gentle in your questioning, and ask if it is ok to ask for more details, if they are needed to understand the nature of the problem. Sex education delivered in a factual nonjudgmental way is also helpf ul, as ma ny teena gers lack realistic, accura te information about sexual functions, pregnancy and birth control, and STD s. They appreciate getting reliable, frank, inf ormatio n from someone they trust, laid out in a way that respectfully a llows them to consider it and make their own decisions. Written resources are particularly helpf ul in presenting this complex and sometimes embarrassing or disturbing information. It may be helpful to have the discussion of sexuality and sexual behavior over time, a luxury that most primary care clinicians can of fer their patients. If you think that a teen is at high risk, have the discussion in the index visit. Finally, most teenagers are concerned with projecting the right image. Knowing little and without experience, most young people find it difficult to clarify their needs and desires, much less express them. Girls are often the ones in position to say \"no\" or \"yes\" to older boys' or men's demands, and are especially vulnerable to unhappy, coercive or even abusive sexual experiences. Remain alert f or clues to the possibility that patients are in a tough situation sexually, a nd need an opportunity to talk. It is often important to ask directly about this. \"What happens when you and your boyfriend argue?\" \"D oes he ever threaten you or hit you?\" \"Are you ever in a situation where he forces you to have sex?\" In a future module, we will thoroughly discuss how to diagnose and respond to physica l and sexual abuse. THE PHYSICIAN'S OWN SEXUALITY In this section, we'll cover the following: 1. Sexuality and sexual feelings Conscious and unconscious f eelings a bout sexuality can interfere with your communications and distort your relationships with patients. 2. Relatio nship Bo undaries and Professio nalism Boundaries are the implicit or explicit limits tha t allow f or a safe professional connection between a clinician and patient. 3. Identifying and managing \"seductive\" behavio r Seductive behaviors are any verbal or nonverbal cues that seem to invite sexual activity. They may be intentional or unconscious; they are socially determined; they a re inappropriate and invariably confusing in medical practice settings. Some reasons peo ple exhibit seductive behavio r Many people display seductive behaviors. Sample Video About seductive behavior Respo nding to seductive behavio r Become more self-\u00adaware of your feelings and behaviors. Respond directly to seductive behavior. Talk with colleagues. Sexuality and sexual feelings Conscious and unconscious f eelings a round sexuality can interfere with your communication and distort your relationships with patients. Sexual f eelings occur in the everyday lives of doctors, nurses, therapists a nd patients alike. They occur normally and naturally when professionals interact with patients and with one another. Problems arise when normal sexual f eelings become distorted, projected or a cted out in the professiona l-\u00adclient relationship. Conscious and unconscious thoughts a nd feelings around sexuality often interfere with the delivery of recommended physical examinations and treatment. It is not unusua l, especia lly early in their careers, for male clinicians to \"defer\" doing breast, rectal or pelvic exams in young women, and for female clinicians to leave out doing genital or rectal exams in young men. Many clinicia ns, because of feelings of attraction or fears related to sexuality or cultural norms are inhibited in a sking about patients' sexual health. At the other end of the spectrum a re clinicia ns who cross bounda ries and engage in s exual relationships with patients. These inappropriate relationships and can lead to devastating consequences f or both parties. All clinicians, especially trainees, must have opportunities to discuss their concerns a round sexuality in clinical care and to work out strategies for addressing these concerns in order to deliver appropriate patient care. Relatio nship Bo undaries and Professio nalism Boundari es are the implicit or explicit limits tha t allow f or a safe professiona l connection between a clinician and patient. Boundary confusio n occurs when the clinician or the patient becomes aware of unusual feelings about sexual issues in the relationship. In one study 72% of 392 psychia try residents, (86% of men and 52% of women) reported sexual attraction to patients. (Gattrell et. al. 1988)Boundary cro ssings occur when clinicians or patients begin acting upon their sexual feelings. Their relationship a ppears increasingly sexualized, but nothing explicit has been said or done. As each person's perceptions become clouded by his or her own desires a nd fears, it becomes increasingly difficult to understand the meaning of the other's behavior. In Gattrell's study 11% of residents believed that one or more patients were aware of their a ttraction. Boundary violatio ns occur as the sexua l dimension of a clinician-\u00adpatient relationship becomes more explicit, understood and acted upon. Gutheil and Gabbard suggest tha t sexual misconduct, the most serious f orm of boundary violation, begins with relatively minor boundary crossings that \". . . show a crescendo pattern of increasing intrusion into the patient's space that culminates in sexual conta ct. A direct shift f rom ta lking to intercour se is quite ra re.\" Peterson suggests tha t, \"In every story of a (boundary) violation . . . four motifs surface: 1) a reversal of roles (the patient takes care of the doctor), 2) a secret (shared intimate feelings), 3) a double bind (it is impossible to stay in or get out of the rela tionship), and 4) an indulgence in professional privilege (the doctor prevails upon the patient to meet a personal need). \" Gattrell found that 1% of residents acknowledged sexual conta ct with patients (all, in retrospect, regretted it). A parallel f inding from this study was that 4% of men and 6% of women acknowledged sexual conta ct with their educators\u2014clinical supervisors, course instructors, a dvisors and administrators, suggesting a possible parallel process of bounda ry violations in professional training activities that is transf erred into practice. (Module 41 is about B oundary issues.) Identifying and managing \"seductive\" behavio r Seductive behaviors are verbal or nonverbal cues that are perceived as inviting a sexual dimension into the relationship. They may be intentional or unconscious; they are socially and contextually determined; they are inappropriate and invariably confusing in medical practice settings. Some people are \"exhibitionist\", a nd may be overly made up or over dressed, or dressed so as to reveal more of their body than needed f or their work or for a physical examina tion. Others are more overtly seductive and act coyly or are flirtatious, employing facia l expressions, movement, gait, gestures, and verbal innuendo that is (are) invitations to sexual activity, while an occasional person will make openly erotic invitations to sexual activity. Some reasons peo ple exhibit seductive behavio r Many people display seductive behaviors. Some have psychiatric illness, some conf use intimacy with sexuality, and much more commonly, people unconsciously reenact a nd project feelings about someone who is not in the room. Patients may unconsciously carry feelings and behaviors about signif icant people from their past into their current medical rela tionships Without any conscious awareness of what is happening, such individuals reenact their f eelings a nd behaviors as if the clinician were the significa nt other person. This is called transf erence. Clinicians also may unconsciously reenact f eelings a nd behaviors carried over from signif icant pa st relationships, and with no conscious awareness invite a sexual dimension into the relationship. This is called counter-\u00adtra nsference. Clinician counter-\u00adtransference is likely to show up or be exaggera ted during periods of feeling isolated, depressed, chronically stressed or fatigued. Some people learn that intimacy in a ny form is an invitation to sexual intimacy, or have never experienced intimacy except f or sexua l intimacy. For them, any opening to share importantexperiences and feelings becomes defined in sexual terms, and experienced a s an invita tion to sexual activity. At times patients' response to successful treatment is expressed in this wa y. People with certain psychiatric disorders, such as somatization disorder, borderline or histrionic personality disorders, schizophrenia, a nd persons who have been abused sexua lly, physically, or emotionally (PTSD ), may have symptoms that include a component of seductive behavior. Example Video Check o ut the video example on the left and consider the questions below. Questio ns: How effectively did the clinician in this video respond to this patient? How would you respond? Respo nding to seductive behavio r Become more self-\u00adaware of your feelings and behaviors. Respond directly to seductive behavior. Talk with colleagues. Sexual f eelings a nd unconscious counter-\u00adtransference are norma l for all clinicians. As a matter of both professiona lism and better communication, we owe it to ourselves and our patients to become awa re of our sexual f eelings a nd associated behaviors. As lifelong learners we should continue to expand awa reness about how they affect our rela tionships. In the video exa mple above, the clinicia n could have immedia tely expressed concern about the inappropriate past relationship with the volleyball coach, and asked about it. He could have asked about a past history of physical or sexual abuse, depression, or low self -\u00adesteem, which may precede maladaptive sexual behaviors. By focusing on the patient and understanding the origins of a patient's behaviors, you keep the conversation in the clinica l realm, on the goal of understanding the patient' s perspective, and on helping the patient. After examining and eliminating your own motives and feelings, noticing that a patient is f lirtatious can serve as a clue to identify potentially serious psychopathology. On the other hand, responding positively to a flirtatious patient may be a warning tha t there are unresolved relationship issues in your own life that you need to address. In interviews with patients, you can begin to respond effectively to seductive behavior by addressing it, a nd setting limits. For example, it is common for male patients to flirt with young women clinicians. Sometimes these patients are elderly or seriously ill, and the clinicia n interprets the comments as a defense against illness, and is not offended. Sometimes a patient will make an explora tory flirtatious comment. If you respond with a non-\u00adverbal message of disapproval, orignore the comment, and continue with the clinical interview, the patient will often get the messa ge. But if the inappropriate comments continue, it is best to address them directly: \"Perhaps you don't mean to offend me, but I find your comments offensive. Comments like this will get in the way of my giving you appropriate medical ca re.\" If comments still persist, it is often best to leave the room and bring back a more senior clinician. If situations seem to arise frequently, it can be help ful to reflect on your own behavior, and discuss this in a safe setting with trusted colleagues and mentors. L.J. Pitkow, at the time of taping a f ourth year student at Drexel College of Medicine, demonstrates responding to seductive patient comments in the videos below: How to get over a flirt? What to do if patient persists? What if attracted to the patient? Example Videos: Please click the picture buttons to play back the videos Sometimes difficult situa tions can arise out of the best intentions if the clinician has not ref lected honestly on the presence of covert sexual f eelings in both clinician and pa tient. One attending clinician shared this story: \"A second year resident told me about a patient he was caring f or. She was a young woman who had been very overweight and who had gained most of her weight in the last two years as her marital rela tionship became more problematic. The resident talked a bout how he really liked this young woman, had spent a lot of time in counseling her a nd she had lost 40 pounds. He added, 'she really looks great now!' \"I told him I thought he was in potential trouble, but he denied there was any problem. The next day the resident called me in a panic. ' Can you come down to the clinic? She kissed me!' I asked, 'What did you do?' He said, ' I kissed her back-I didn't wa nt her to feel rejected!' I said, 'I'll be right down.' \" \"I spent time with them together, and talked with the patient about what had happened. She acknowledged she w as falling in love with her clinician as a way to avoid dealing with her relationship issues. She agreed to go for counseling. And the resident learned a valuable lesson about boundaries, and paying a ttention to his feelings in patient care.\" We would add that the advice to seek counseling applies equally to the resident. It is one thing to cross a boundary of sexual feelings f or a patient and quite another to change one's behavior and self awareness to gua rd against such things happening in the future. Professiona l counseling may be the best route to ensure success in this situation. SUMMARY Interviewing about sexual matters is an important and routine part of medical encounters and avoiding this topic risks limiting patients' healthy sexual f unctioning, illness and dea th from HIV and other STD's, boundary violations a nd clinicians' well-\u00adbeing.We stress that failing to learn skillful and rela tionship-\u00adcentered interviewing about sexual issues can produce the following negative consequences f or patient care: Avoidance o f patients o r not perfo rming services Not asking about risky sexual behaviors and counseling to minimize risk (a serious omission in this age of widespread HIV infection.) Not doing genital, brea st and rectal examinations that detect cancer, STD 's and other conditions. Inabilit y to manage advances o r attractions fro m pat ients Leads to tensions and confusion in encounters, preventing the development of a therapeutic relationship, even causing patients to terminate care prema turely. Increased risk of boundary co nfusion or violatio n Unacknowledged or ambiguous sexual feelings can distort our perceptions or behaviors. Providers who a re unaware or uncertain about their sexual feelings are more likely to engage in inappropriate beha viors that blur professiona l boundaries. Erosion of pro fessional sat isfact ion and well-\u00adbeing Denying or ignoring norma l personal sexuality can limit the vitality a nd energy derived from work and relationships. BEHAVIOR CHECK LIST 1. Provide appropriate rationale for sexual history 2. Ensure confidentiality 3. Ask concrete, specific questions 4. Ask about impact on patient's lif e 5.

How might your spiritua l/religious belief s affect your ability to discuss spiritual/religious issues with patients? 2. In what circumstances do you believe it would be inappropriate to explore patients' religious belief s? 3. How would you respond to a patient who declines your a dvice because of a religious belief, such as a Jehovah's Witness who refuses a needed blood transfusion? 4. How would you respond to patients who ask you to pray with them? Check out the video example on the left and try answering the question below: What are your responses to the clinician and to the patient in this short movie? Key Principles: 1. Religion and spirituality are important to many of your patients 2. When you explore the role of religion and spiritua lity in patients' lives, this is usually helpful to them 3. When patients make meaning of their medical condition in religious terms, this may have positive as well as negative consequences f or their well being 4. Clarifying patients' religious interpretation of their suf fering may help you offer additional support, including ref erral to an expert 5. Never impose your religious/ spiritual belief s on your patients, as this is a professional bounda ry violationLearning go als: At the co nclusion o f this mo dule, yo u will be able to : Describe the ra tionale f or exploring and supporting the role of religion a nd spirituality in patients' lives Ask patients about the importance of religion and spirituality in their lives Explore whether patients' religious beliefs give meaning and support to them in their experience of serious illness, suff ering, and death Offer patients religious a nd spiritual supports such as referrals to clergy Describe possible professiona l boundary violations with respect to religious a nd spiritual matters APPRECIATING PATIENTS' RELIGION AND SPIRITUALITY Religion and medicine have a common tra dition of alleviating suff ering; yet in modern times the religious /spiritual dimension of the person is little a ddressed in clinica l training. Nearly three-\u00adquarters of Americans say that their a pproach to life is grou nded in their religious belief s. In clinical encounters, ignoring patients' religious belief s limits your ability to attend to their needs. For millennia a nd across cultures and regions, religion and spirituality have ha d a special influence on people during times of personal crisis a nd suffering. It theref ore seems likely to have a n impact on health and response to disease. Just such an association ha s been demonstrated in numerous studies that have been reported in the medical, nursing, medical sociology and epidemiology literature. The inclusion of religious a nd spiritual problems in D SM IV further supports the importance of addressing this aspect of the person in the clinica l setting. In this module we explore the role that religion and spiritua lity play in medical settings. The United States is a highly religious nation with 94% of Americans professing a belief in God, 57% report praying daily, 42% attending religious services regularly. Nearly three-\u00adqua rters of Americans say that their a pproach to life is grounded in their religious belief s.(3) 82% of adults surveyed believe in the healing power of personal prayer and 77% believe that God sometimes intervenes to cure people who have a serious illness. Twenty-\u00adeight percent of the sample of 1004 adults believed in the ability of faith healers to make people well through their f aith or persona l touch.(4 ) A substantial research literature now demonstrates that religious involvement has sa lutary ef fects on a broad range of mental and physical health outcomes, including mortality risk.(5-\u00ad7) An ea rly study of health related variables of 91,000 people in Washington County, Maryland, and f ound a decreased risk for Ischemic Heart Disease death, liver cirrhosis, emphysema, and suicide in people who regularly attended church.(8) In addition, studies have linked religious involvement with many behavioral health outcomes, including drinking, smoking, drug use, sea tbelt use, sleep quality, and exercise.(9-\u00ad11) Adolescent behavior studies f ind that higher levels of religious involvement are inversely related to alcohol and drug use, smoking, sexual activity, depressive symptoms and suicide risk.(12,13)Researchers have explored a number of possible mechanisms to explain how religiousness may influence health and well-\u00adbeing. Examples have included support networks, coping processes, health related activities at religious institutions, a nd other psychosocial variables such as optimism and hopefulness, meaning, a nd forgiveness.(14-\u00ad17) A meta-\u00adanalysis of 147 studies concluded that there was a robust but modest inverse association between religiousness and depressive symptoms.(18) A meta-\u00adana lysis of 49 studies of religious coping f ound that positive forms of religious coping were related to lower levels of depression, anxiety, and distress.(19) Simila r findings come from reviews of studies of religious beliefs a nd coping among HIV-\u00adpositive individuals. These studies have also f ound that spirituality and religion a re positively related to immune system f unction.(20) We include this module to help you explore these issues and develop your a bility to explore and accept patients' perspectives and decisions. DIALOGUES ABOUT RELIGIOUS AND SPIRITUAL ISSUES Recognition is growing that the biopsychosocial model of health should include the spiritual dimension. (3-\u00ad6) Inclusion would reinstate important therapeutic tools to clinicia ns' repertoire, and enhance patients' ability to cope with illness and suff ering. Attending to the spiritual dimension provides clinicians with a deeper understanding of patients and their needs. Religious belief s impact on patients' health and response to disease, and exert a special influence during times of persona l crisis and suff ering. Clinicians' own religious or spiritual practices may impact upon their ability to function effectively in clinical practice The n ature and depth of conversations about religious and spiritual issues will vary in accordance with the circumstances of clinical encounters, the time ava ilable, your role in the care of particular patients, patients' views and responses, and your comfort with these topics. Conversation about advance directives or in the face of life threatening illness invites explora tion of religion a nd spirituality in greater depth. Routine visits for minor medical problems ma y not call f or as much attention to spiritual concerns. IMPLEMENTATION OF CONVERSATIONS Four specific skills f acilita te your exploration of the spiritual dimensions of health, well-\u00ad being, illness and suf fering. Use of these skills improves patients' a bility to cope with their medical circumstances and to enhance their well-\u00adbeing. The framew ork already presented establishes the ra tionale f or use of the skill sets discussed in this section. The skills parallel those discussed in the \"Essentia l Elements\" modules, with specific modif ications related to the content area of religion and spirituality. The skill sets are as follows: 1. non-\u00adjudgmental explo ratio n Clinicians' own religious (or anti-\u00adreligious) beliefs can distort their perceptions of patients' experience, as well as their interviews and relationships with patients. (Example Video ) 2. Specific inquiry at times of suffering Start with a general inquiry about patients' illness experience and then ask how thisexperience links to religious beliefs, how they interprets their suff ering, and wha t role prayer or other practices play in ef forts to cope.. 3. Demonstratio n of Understanding and Respect Inviting patients to dialog about religion a nd spirituality at times of suffering is a complex process, and requires specia l attention to context, relationship and non-\u00adverbal signa ls. 4. Suggesting / offering help When patients trust you, you may direct them to helpf ul religious a nd spiritual resources in the community. (Example Video) Non-\u00adjudgmental explo ratio n Clinicians' own religious (or anti-\u00adreligious) belief s can distort their perceptions of patients' experience, as well as their conduct of interviews and relationships with patients. D evelop your a bility to explore and accept religious beliefs in a non-\u00adju dgmental manner, independent from your own beliefs. In parallel with inquiry about your pa tients' family and social support systems, ask simple open-\u00ad ended questions about their views on religious a nd spiritual issues, and whether religion and/ or spirituality plays an important role in their life. The discussion of 'Advance D irectives' (DocCom Module 32) ca n also be a useful context in which to addres s spiritual issues. \"How importa nt is religion to you?\" \"What role does spirituality play in your life?\" \"Are you part of a religious community?\" \"What role does it play in your life?\" \"Are there thing s you would like for me to know about your spiritual belief s and how they have an impa ct on your health (or illness?)\" See Example Video on the next screen. AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) Inqui ry at t imes of suffering Start with a general inquiry about patients' illness experience, and then ask how this experience links to their religious beliefs, how they interpret their suffering, and wha t role prayer or other practices plays in their efforts to cope. Clinicians' concerns about not seeming intrusive or insensitive, based on their own emotiona l response to severe suf fering, may make it dif ficult for us to ask patients specific questions about their religious response to suff ering. Pra cticing some potential inquiries and talking over situations with team members and collea gues can ena ble you to bring patients into conversation about these issues. These dialogues are not only supportive for their own sa ke, but they can also reveal possible new forms of support. That asking specif ic quest ions of a patient who is suf fering a life threatening condition might havethe effect of imposing an extra burden (the last thing a caring clinician would wish to do) should not deter you. However, questions need to be accompanied by good rela tionship skills (see 'Demonstrate Understanding and Respect' below). Remembering to pause for reflective silences is an invaluable aid to considerate dialogue. If patients demur from the discussion, you can move on, and if they seem off ended you can offer a compassionate apology and listen with empathy to their concerns. \"This is such a difficult and painf ul time f or you. How are you doing a t this moment?\" \"Can you tell me more about what it has been like?\" \"Would prayer or meditation be helpf ul for you in these times?\" Demo nstrate Understanding and Respect When you invite patients to dialog about religion and spirituality at times of suffering, attend especia lly to your relationship skills a nd non-\u00adverbal signals. When you address sensitive issues, whether in the context of lif e-\u00adthreatening illness or acute or chronic suff ering, show your a cceptance of patients' perspectives and demonstrate respect for them as persons. Your expression of understanding and respect must be both clear and genuine. Assure that your verbal expressions and your a ccompanying non-\u00adverbal gestures are consonant with each other (D ocCom Modules 6 and 14). Check o ut the sho rt video example about \"demonstrate understanding\" on the left. Suggesting / offering help When you have confidence that patients feel understood and trust you, you can help them identify religious and spiritual resources within their community a t times of confusion or loss. The risk of seeming judgmental, insensitive or in some way inappropriate is particularly great when it comes to making suggestions or offering help around the religious a nd spiritual dimensions of patients' lives. You should only attempt such off ers or suggestions when your conversations make you confident that patients feel understood and respected in these areas. When and if patients signal their trust in your relationship, you can make suggestions such as medita tion or prayer, or offer to enlist the help of an appropriate religious leader f rom the same faith background.As an alternative, f ollowing exploration of religious and spiritual issues you can invite patients to make their own suggestions about ways to access greater spiritua l support. This is often more effective than suggestions from clinicians. This kind of invitation can feel like a test or a burden to some patients, so attention to the skills of sharing information and reaching agreement (Modules 10 and 11) helps to discover strategies that work in patients' best interest at this point in time. Additiona l examples of resources you might explore with patients include the f ollowing: religious institutions' outreach to medically ill individua ls; community 12 step meetings; religious based counseling and prevention; early detection a ctivities through religious organizations Develop a list of clergy in the community who can serve as a cultural broker-\u00ad someone who can put patients in touch with culturally appropriate resources. \"Can your relig ious beliefs or your spiritual community provide you some support at this time?\" \"What do you know about resources that might help\u2014have f riends or neighbors mentioned help they received in times of stress?\" \"In addition to the medications, I would like to help you find sources of moral or religious or spiritual support-\u00adif that makes sense to you?\" \"Are you aware of counselling or support services available throug h your church?\" \"I know of a church with many people from (Vietna m / Mexico)-\u00adperhaps the pastor there could put you in touch with ....\" See next screen for an example video. AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) PROFESSIONAL BOUNDARIES Adjust your engagement with patients so tha t you respect your personal belief s and sensibilities. Maintain a professional boundary - clinicians may be healers, but they are not spiritual leaders. A crossover in the roles of clinicia ns and spiritual leaders is present in ma ny cultures -\u00ad after all, before the scientif ic era, societ ies' healers were their priests or sha mans. Patients have similar hopes whether they see a clinician or a spiritual leader, especially when their suff ering is intense. They seek a t least relief from suf fering, and of ten hope f or a miraculous cure. When you open the sensitive topics of religion and spirituality with patients, you sometimes tap into this complex territory. If patients should ask you to pray with them, f or exa mple, your response is conditioned both by how f ully you have explored the patients' belief s and by your own religious a nd spiritual experiences. If you aff irm the value of pra yer and you have explored patients' beliefs a nd can genuinely respond positively, do so. You might also suggest tha t the patient pray while you listen quietly. If you do not feel comfortable with these opt ions, respectfully decline and offer ref erral. A gesture that would violate appropriate professional bounda ries would be to spontaneously offerto pray with patients because that is how you persona lly might handle the suf fering. True professiona lism means that you understand and respect the bounda ries of clinician-\u00adpa tient relationships in the present era. Your engagement with patients should always be calibrated to match their needs to your sensibilities, and never to match your needs to their suff ering, no matter how strong your personal commitment to a particular religion or spiritual practice (22,23). SUMMARY Most Americans say that religion is important to them. If you ignore this dimension, you limit your a bility to attend to your patients' needs. Religious belief s impact patients' health and response to disease, and they exert a special influence during times of personal crisis and suff ering. Empathic explora tion and dialogue about religious and spiritual matters is an important therapeutic tool. Clinicians who compassion ately address religion and spiritua lity in their medical encounters can enhance patients' ability to cope with illness. Helping to arrange referrals and consultations can provide additiona l support. In this module we provide both a rationale and a framework f or conversations about religion and spirituality in medical settings, and we describe skills to implement such therapeutic conversations in a compassionate manner.

(exception: cases of family violence or abuse.) 4. Encouraging family members to share feelings and responding with empathy assists information exchange, f inding common ground and adherence to plans. Learning go als: At the co nclusion o f this mo dule, yo u will be able to :demonstrate how to join with both pa tient and f amily, demonstrate setting the agenda with the pa tient and f amily in the room, demonstrate the most eff ective method of gathering information and managing a medical family interview, identify methods of responding to family members' emotions, describe an effective method for establishing a plan with a family during a medical family interview. INTRODUCTION Families a re the context within which most health problems and illnesses occur, and skillful family interviewing improves health outcomes. Despite changing demographics of American fa milies, most patients live with f amily members and are strongly inf luenced by f amily relationships. The f amily remains the most basic relational unit and intimate social environment in our society. As such, the family has a major influence on the physical and mental health of its members (1). Clinicians have the opportunity to anticipate and reduce the adverse effects of f amily stress a nd utilize the f amily as a resource in patient care. The biopsychosocial model emphasizes interrelationships between biological, interpersonal, and social factors in health (2). It recognizes tha t the family is the primary source of health beliefs, health-\u00adrela ted behaviors, stress, and emotional support. Family interviewing skills are most often used during routine medical visits when a nother family member is present. S ometimes f amily skills will be used for pla nned family meetings, and these are usually in relation to end of life or serious illness events. Family Influences o n Health A large body of resea rch demonstrates that families powerfully inf luence physical health, including overall morbidity and mortality (1,2). Numerous epidemiologic studies demonstrate that social support, particularly f rom the family, is associated with reduced mortality and morbidity (4). Fa mily support improves outcomes from chronic medic al illness, while f amily stresses such as loss of a spouse a nd divorce can negatively influence health outcomes. Marriage has the strongest influence on physica l health. Even af ter controlling for other factors, marital status affects overall morta lity, mortality from specific illnesses (e.g. cancer and coronary disease) and morbidity (3,4). Married individuals are healthier tha n the widowed, who a re in turn healthier than either divorced or never married individuals. Large studies show that bereavement or death of a spouse increases mortality, especially for men (4). Separation and divorce are also associated with increased mortality. The quality of marital rela tionships can influence the outcome of chronic medical illnesses, including coronary artery disease, congestive heart f ailure, end-\u00adsta ge renal disease and metastatic brea st cancer (5,6,7). Unlike patient centered interviewing, little empirical research exists on the relationship of patient and family satisfaction or health outcomes to specif ic family interviewing skills. However, studieshave examined the effectiveness and utility of f amily history taking, clinicians' level of involvement with fa milies, and family meetings (8). A recent meta-\u00adanalysis of family interventions in a wide range of adult diseases demonstrated signif icant improvement in the physica l and mental health of the patients as well as improvement in the health of key family members (9). This literature provides strong support for the importance of interviewing fa milies in clinical practice (2). THE SKILLS OF FAMIL Y INTERVIEWING Families a re always involved in major medical decisions a nd end-\u00adof-\u00adlife discussions, and they sometimes participate in more routine medical encounters. Specif ic interview strategies will enhance the likelihood of benef icial medical outcomes. Because f amilies exert a tremendous influence on patient's health, including fa mily members in outpatient and inpatient settings is of critical im portance. Ignoring or avoiding family members who would like to be present always has negative repercussions for the patient, and usually f or the family and the clinician as well. Family interviews a re common during discussion of end-\u00adof -\u00adlife issues or around other major illness events, in the office or in the hospital. These situa tions a re often the most important moments in patients' lives, full of important decisions and conflicts. Family interviews a lso occur f requently when a patient's family member attends a \"routine\" medical visit. A parent might accompany a child; an adult child accompany a parent; or a partner/spouse a ccompany the loved one. Basic interview skills f acilitate f amily interviews, but additional skills and strategies maximize both interview outcomes and health outcomes, particularly when importa nt decisions must be made or conflicts managed and surmounted. Practicing the special skills that enhance fa mily interviews builds confidence and the willingness to include f amily members when it is desired or when family members request inclusion. This module explores, describes and illustra tes specia l skills f or maximizing the benef it of family interviews. Join with t he Family. Certain strategies help develop ra pport and establish a positive relationship with each f amily member at the outset of a n encounter. With each family member, greet , shake hands and make a co nnect ion. Greet each family member and learn each f amily member's relationship to the patient. Make a simple connection with each a nd every family member -\u00ad be mindful of reaching out beyond the family member who tends to take on the executive function in the f amily. Examples might sound like the f ollowing: \"Oh, I heard you were flying in from C alifornia.\" \" I know you thado take off from work to be here..thanks.\" Rearrange t he seat ing to establish the impo rtance o f the clinician's relat ionship with t he patient . Often, a more dominating family member will take a seat adjacent to the clinician, with the patient placed on the other side of the f amily member. This creates a barrier between the patient and the clinician. Take the initia tive to ask the family member to exchange seats with the patient, a symbolica lly important move. It establishes that the patient-\u00adclinician relationship is paramount and that family members cannot ' unseat' the patient. Learn each family member's relatio nship to the patient . If uncertain about any person's relationship to the patient, establish that relationship, so a sto understand the fa mily member's current or future role with the patient's healthcare pla n. Assumptions ca n often be incorrect -\u00ad f or exa mple, when a man accompanies a mom and her infant. Misunderstandings can be painful and destructive, particularly when someone thinks that the clinicia n does not care who the players are. \"So, Estella, you are related to Virgina, how?\" Affirm t he impo rtance o f each perso n's co ntributio n. Set a positive tone by aff irming the value of having each person present and involved in the family meeting. Explicitly acknowledge that fa mily members' presence in the room expresses their ca re and concern for the patient. \"I'm so impressed that each of you cares enoug h about Hank to have put a side your other activities in order to attend this meeting.\" Create a safe and suppo rtive enviro nment for all participants. Take responsibility for leading the time together by stating the reason f or the conversation. Let participants know that you will be not only the \"scientif ic\" expert, but also be attentive to supporting all participa nts in the conversation. Value everyone's potential contributions by reminding everyone that you will do your best to keep the conversation on tra ck and the tone positive. You ca n thus set a tone of respect and common concern. \"We are here to explore the plans for Jane's care. I expect you'll have many questions and concerns. I'll share my knowledge and the ideas that experts have discussed with me, I'll try to keep the conversation on track a nd I'll also work toward helping all of us be a team together by helping each of you to participate.\" Unique Circumstances Specia l circumstances alter the protocols for \"joining\" together. Children: Children often accompany f amily members f or routine visits, and most children pick up much of a conversa tion even if they seem not to be paying a ttention. Use discretion in discussing topics that could be sensitive and negotiate with the patient about the child' s presence. In the case of patients who are children, arrange to have the have the parent close to the child while the clinicia n is talking directly to the patient; if a very young child, encourage the parent to hold the patient in her / his lap. See Module 21 a bout interviewing children. \"We all need to be frank and open in our conversation, and if we approach very delicate subjects, I might ask whether you'd like to ask Tom a nd Jane to step outside with a puzzle or game f or a few moments. How does that sound?\" Elderly or severely disabled patient s: The elderly patient def initely needs to be seated closest to the clinician. The most obvious reason is for the patient's ability to hear the clinician. The \"patient's chair\" is always the one closest to the clinician, and the actual patient, even in the case of dementia or other serious disability, should be in that chair. Many concerned adult children can inadve rtently hamper the clinicia n's ability to form a connection and establish rapport with the patient. Interpret ers-\u00ad whether family member o r pro fessional. Even though an interpreter may be doing most of the direct speaking to the clinician, the clinician should maintain eye contact with the patient and speak directly to him. Usually, the interpreter sits next to the clinician, although some patients pref er the interpreter to sit near them f or comfort's sa ke.Family co nflict. All families have disagreements. Particula rly if the medical situation is very complex or lif e-\u00ad threatening, conflicts ma y become intense, and pref erences difficult to negotia te. We present some strategies for working with disagreements below, but in the case of serious family conflict, experts recommend that the clinician separate fa mily members and work with each member individually. \"The emotiona l temperature is getting very high here, and I'd like to suggest that I conduct some individual conversations as a way to get us on tra ck. I'll include everyone. Let me begin with Virginia, and ask others to step outside f or a few minutes.\" Family member abuse. In situations where abuse of the patient is a possibility, the clinician must make space to interview the patient separately. See Module 28 for more details. Set Agenda and Specify Go als After initial relationship building, take the initiative to specif y goals and outline an agenda for the family interview. Clinicians should begin by stating their goals and their sense of the interview agenda, and then invite those present to state concerns, issues, other goals and their sense of agenda. Then, negotiate with the family as to what is realistic to address in this particular interview. Working towards an unwieldy list of goals or towards goals that a re too lofty will a lmost alwa ys sabotage the effectiveness of a family interview. Goals need to be linked to a health concern. A goal to \"change how my mother a cts when she is around us\" is not an attainable one. However, the clinician might wonder whether \"managing Ja ne's pain better so that she is more comf ortable (and less disruptive)\" might begin a fruitful negotia tion process a bout what ca n actually be done to improve Jane' s health. In many situations, f amily members will have more global or complex goals for the patient that cannot be easily linked to the patient' s current medical situa tion. In such cases, a mental health referral to a family therapist is a helpful next step. Gather Info rmat ion Respect and af firm each f amily member during information gathering by attending to each person, naming f amily resources and maintaining confidentiality. Gather inf ormation from each family member and elicit each person's perspective. Do not fail to elicit each person' s perspective on the topic f or the visit/meeting. Check with everyone about whether they have information about the situation that has not yet been stated. Leaving out any family member might result in missing data or views that could inform treatment decisions\u2014of ten the quietest person' s views prove to be insightf ul and fa cilitative for the family encounter. Particularly if family members' perspectives diverge, a ffirm each person's input. Inclusiveness minimizes later conflict and suggests that each person is welcome to participate in subsequent decision-\u00admaking. Identify family resources. Family cohesiveness and ability to rally around the patient is strengthened when the clinician articulates family strengths and resources. Identif y for everyone the supports and assets revealed as people gather and share thoughts.\"I'm impressed by how much everyone appears to care for each other in this family.\" \"It wa s not easy f or all of you to get here, but you have all mobilized to support Tom.\"\"You seem like a thoug htful family, and you put family first-\u00ad that will be a big help as we move f orward.\" Do not breach confidentiality. Ma intain strict confidentiality with the patient. If family members request information that the patient has not explicitly agreed to share, do not reveal it. \"How did Tom contract the hepatitis virus?\" \"I'm not a t liberty to share whatever inf ormation I have about this topic. Tom will decide wha t he wants to share with others.\" Set Limits during Info rmat ion Gathering Information gathering dra gs interminably on unless the clinician has stra tegies f or limiting distractions and setting limits. Without limit-\u00adsetting the interview is unlikely to move to fa mily agreement and task assignment. Handle disruptio ns and distractio ns gently and firmly. In many fa mily interviews one or more members interrupts others or asks distra cting questions. The clinician must develop verbal a nd nonverbal skills tha t assist in minimizing time lost to distractions and also produce a helpful flow of information and views. Nonverba l gestures include gently raising the hand, like a benevolent traffic cop, or r eaching over to gently touch the \"noisy\" person. Verbal statements, made with or without the gestures, might sound like the f ollowing: \"John, we all value your views, but right now Sally has something she wishes to say.\" \"It's crucial that I hear from everyone, and I'll be certain that you have the chance to share your thoughts, in a few moments.\" \"This issue is complex, as we have discussed, and I n eed to hear from everyone in turn. We will not leave any stone unturned.\" Set firm limits fo r perso ns who tend to monopolize. Often, the most anxious fa mily member tends to monopolize or interrupt. Assert leadership, while remaining empathic, and everyone will be reassured. Acknowledge the norma lity of anxiety in difficult and often unpredictable medical situa tions, and also remind the person who monopolizes that everyone's contribution has equal importance. State your a ppreciation that the person is trying to be helpful. Use the nonverbal \"traffic cop\" gestures (above). The PEARLS empathic statements (Module 6-\u00ad Partnership, stating the Emotion, A ffirming the person, Respecting the attempt to help, Legitimizing the anxiety, and Supporting the person / family) all apply, and sta ting them a long with the need for the person who monopolizes to give others a chance will be eff ective. \"Gosh, it is normal f or the unknowns in the situation to produce lots of worry f or you; and I do value your thoughts. Right now, I need to hear from Jessica .\" \"Thanks f or your input. I know we are working toward the same goal of helping Adrian. I must ask you again to give me the space to hear from everyone.\" Set similar limit s if a family member seeks to speak fo r the patient . When patients are able to speak for themselves, the person who \"speaks for the patient\" often is trying to be certain the clinician correctly understands the situation. Such people often are \"controlling,\" because they have a strong idea about what facts are \"correct\" orwhat would be the \"best\" next step. Employ empathic statements similar to those in the above paragraph in order to allay their fears that others do not fully understand. \"Thanks f or the additional input. We will work tog ether to fully understand the complexity of the situation so that we can design the best possible next steps. Because Kim is the patient, I want to be certain she speaks f or herself about these issues-\u00ad please hold off for a few minutes.... I' ll give everyone a chance to contribute.\" Respo nd to Emo tions Sharing f eelings a nd showing respect for feelings that people disclose promote successful family meetings. Enco urage family members to share feelings. When f amily members discover tha t they share previously unspoken feelings, they become less isolated f rom one another. When they discover tha t the clinician understands the feelings and is comf ortable receiving them, the family's a bility and motivation to think and act as a team, to set goals a nd cooperate with the clinician and with pla ns they establish i s greatly enhanced. When f eelings a re mentioned, respond with empathy-\u00aduse strategies discussed in Modules 6 and 13. \"I hear that you are afraid James might die-\u00ad this is a perfectly norma l feeling in this situation.\" When f eelings a re not mentioned spontaneously, perhaps it is because some people do not readily share their feelings, or think that \"sticking to the facts\" is what they should do in medical situations. It is easy to let people know you value hearing about feelings, and that you encourage their expression. \"I'd be interested to know how each of you is f eeling about the new diagnosis for Suzanne? Please share your feelings with me-\u00ad it will help us get over any rough patches as they arise.\" Ample evidence about fa mily function supports the notion that giving ea ch family member an outlet to express f ears, confusion, irritation and reservations about a situation is comforting, helps people relax as much a s possible in f rightening circumstances, and builds cohesion.(2) They feel understood and more confident in the clinicia n's care. Finally, it helps them share both present and future concerns more freely. Maintain an empat hic stance with everyo ne. Show every f amily member that you are a witness to their pa in, difficulty or other emotion. Ignoring or avoiding or not responding to any one person diminishes everyone's confidence in the clinician, and inhibits cohesion. Planning a nd adherence become more uncertain and less ef fective. Understandably, many clinicians f ind it difficult to strengthen the ir conviction that maintaining an empathic stance toward fa mily members who seem to be contributing to the problem is facilita tive. Once clinicians develop the confidence in their ability to show empathy despite reservations about the person in question, they discover tha t seeking to understand that person's f eelings of ten reveals hidden fears or frustration or anger. Not only is getting the f eelings out and responding with empathy reassuring to that person and all family members, but it also builds cohesion. Sometimes it helps mend f amily rifts, and sometimes the \"difficult\" person becomes a strong a lly in helping solve future problems. The important exception to this \"rule\" is when the clinician suspects that a buse or neglect is present. Family members should not be seen together until the team is satisfied tha t thepatient's sa fety is ensured. Find Commo n Gro und Clinicians who are effective in family interviews never \"take sides\" when conflict is present, and they reframe unique ideas to help find common ground. Never \"t ake sides\" in co nflict sit uations. Sometimes a family member's feelings of fear or frustration (or another emotion) will surface as an accusation that someone is not doing something or doing too much of something. Maintain a position of neutrality when family members express their feelings in a manner that could develop into a conflict situa tion. A family member might lobby hard to get the cli nician to \"take my side,\" but falling into an alliance with one f amily member not only would make directing the conversation more difficult, but also would limit worthwhile outcomes. Remain a concerned listener: \"Don' t you agree tha t Matthew should stop pestering his sick brother about taking the medicine, Doctor?\" \"I hear your concern f or your brother and understand your point, Kelley, but let's try to work out a plan tog ether-\u00ad no one has a ll the answers.\" As in \"empathic stance,\" above, if the patient's sa fety is at risk, protect the patient by helping organize a safe situation. Find co mmo n gro und fo r the family unit . In any family visit or meeting, one key clinician goal should be to help all participants find common ground. A chieving this goal may be simple when everyone expresses concern f or the well being of the patient. A t times a participant may have an interest, a good idea or an individual concern that seems unique. Seek commona lities among various members' thoughts. Reframe an idea or concern as one worthy of joint concern for the entire family. This f raming as the family' s joint concern helps the family to work colla boratively towards what's best f or the patient and the family. \"I'm worried that Aunt Ida may not remember to take the medicine.\" \"That is a good point, Albert, and I bet most everyone shares that concern? ....Let' s make certain we plan the medicatio n routine carefully.\" Reach Agreement and Clo se Bring f amily interviews to a successful conclusion by reviewing, summarizing, and agreeing on tasks. A ssist dysfunctional fa milies to achieve wha t is best for the family unit by ref erring them to a family therapist. Begin with a review o f the int erview go als. Review the reasons why the family came together for the meeting, and declare that the group has worked out a plan for meeting them. Remind everyone that few plans for complex situations are \"perfect\", and tha t any needed adjustments can be made as the situation warrants. \"Let's remind ourselves of the reasons we came together today. First, we ag reed to explo re whether everyone could lend a hand in helping Darius manage his ALS.Also, we agreed......\" Summarize agreements, including next steps. Summarize areas of a greement and pla ns for next steps. Check with each person in the room and secure their verbal or nonverba l assent. Ask if a nyone - don't f orget to include the patient in this review -\u00ad ha s residual or unspoken concerns or new ideas about next steps. Get specific abo ut tasks. As the clinician summarizes agreements and next steps, the patient and some f amily members will often volunteer to help. Accept the offers, and ask who else can take on a task. Be very specific about who is doing what, and by when - write out the plans so that each participant does not have to count on remembering all the details. \"Tanya a greed to email everyone weekly a bout Jim' s progress. Larry will accompany Darius on every visit to the neurologist, and report results to Tanya.....\" Refer families that are no t functio ning well. Clinicians who perceive dysfunction in a family should refer the family to a family therapist. The dysfunction might be that a family cannot unite around a common goal. The f amily dynamic may preclude healthy negotia tion of roles a nd tasks. Perhaps conflicts may render supporting each other impossible. Start by acknowledging everyone's suffering and the complexity of both the medical situation and its emotional impact. Then state that it is common that fa milies f acing this type of problem need assistance in f inding common ground and supporting each other. Suggest a specific thera pist that has helped others in similar situations. Acknowledge that all want the best f or the patient and for each other, a nd that this therapist will be helpful in achi eving this goal. Referral is always a delicate ta sk-\u00ad be frank, but succinct; be clear but empa thic with each person. \"Looking at how hard this situa tion is hitting everyone, and how complex it is, I'm thinking that you all could use help is getting on the same track a nd supporting each other through this very difficult time. How does that sound to you?.... Nancy Deering, a trusted colleague who has helped many of my fa milies a t times like this could help you provide the best f or each other. I'd like you to connect with her.\" Arrange a fo llow up meeting when appropriate. AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) RELEVANT BEHAVIORS 1.

When you last spent time around an infant, toddler, preschool, or school-\u00adage child, could you have engaged in a ge-\u00adappropriate play? 2. When last in a public place in the presence of a crying child, or one having a tantrum, what were your thoughts, reactions and feelings? 3. What would be easiest (hardest) for you about interacting with a school-\u00adage child with her mom in the room? Her dad? 4. What is the role of the parent in the pediatric encounter? Wha t attitudes do you have a bout parents that might get in the way of working effectively with them? 5. What are your thoughts a nd reactions when in the presence of a seriously ill infa nt, toddler, preschool or school-\u00adage child? 6. Were you or a sibling seriously ill at a young age, and what f eelings do you reca ll about that experience? 7. What childhood interactions with clinicians do you remember, and what are your feelings about them? How might you use these experiences (positive or negative) to learn how to effectively engage with children and their fa milies? Key Principles: 1. Building and sustaining relationships with children and their fa milies is the cornerstone for competent pediatric care. 2. Infants, toddlers, preschool and school-\u00adage children have different world views and react differently, requiring clinicia ns to vary their greetings and interactions a ccordingly. 3. Playing with children is essential for good pediatric ca re; and clinicians play differently with infants, toddlers, preschool a nd school-\u00adage children 4. Direct communica tion between clinicia n and child improves relationships, satisfaction, adherence, a nd health outcomes. 5. The foundation of quality pediatric ca re is the clinicia ns' ability to skillfully open the interview, understand the child's and family's perspective, build relationship, share information and rea ch agreement. Learning go als: At the co nclusion o f this mo dule, yo u will be able to : Describe the ra tionale f or including children in the interview a nd demonstrate skills for engaging them. Describe the typical illness concepts of preschool children and school-\u00adage children. Describe techniques f or communicating with children of varying ages including the use of play and rapport-\u00adbuilding strategies. Elicit the child' s and parents' perspectives on the illness / problems as well as their understanding of treatment plans. Invite and elicit f eelings of parents and children; acknowledge a nd accept those emotions. Describe ways to show empathy in the pediatric interview Share diagnostic and treatment information gently, with respect and compassion; avoid jargon INTRODUCTION Pediatric interactions are complica ted, routinely involve the doctor-parent-child triad and other family members, and are influenced by the cognitive and developmental stage of the child and changing f amily roles. The pediatric encounter encompasses not only medical problems, but also psychosocial and developmental issues. \"When I cough my brain shakes.\" - 3-\u00adyea r-\u00adold Ethan his headache \"No doctor! No doctor!\" - 2-\u00adyea r-\u00adold Ryan, initially refusing to be examined (1) \"It sounds like she swallowed a whistle.\" - Mother of 1-\u00adyear-\u00adold infant Communicating with children and their fa milies is complex, and differs in many wa ys from communicating with an adult who is capable of making heath care decisions. Children are consta ntly changing, a nd their perspective va ries by developmental stage, including their cognitive, social, a nd emotional development. The changing needs of both children and f amily members require that clinicia ns be f lexible enough to modula te their interview and physical examina tion stra tegies a ccording to developmenta l stage. Pediatric interactions routinely involve more tha n one fa mily member. Parent(s) or guardian, and often the patient's sibling(s) are present. The doctor-\u00adpatient relationship expa nds to become the doctor-\u00adpa rent-\u00adchild relationship. The interaction dynamics of this triadic communication are particularly challenging when child and pa rent have different needs.The pediatric interview encompasses not only medical concerns, but also psychosocial and developmenta l concerns. More and more children are seen f or behavioral and developmental problems, especially in primary care.(2) 1) Rider EA. The examination. s communication role deserves specia l attention. Studies show that direct communication between clinicia n and child contributes to improved relationship, satisfaction with care, treatment adherence , and better health outcomes.(3,4) \"I'm so scared, my eyes are making tears.\" - 4-\u00adyea r-\u00adold Jonathan, worried about getting shots. Health professionals formerly relied on parents for information about their child's health. Children understand more about concepts of health and illness than previously thought, can provide unique and valuable information about themselves, and, when able, should be inv olved in decisions about their own health care.(5,6) Check o ut the video example: As in any clinical interview you will see relationship building and other communication skill competencies ca rried out in conjunction with history taking and other interview tasks. The interviews, physical examinations and their scrolled list of skill labels selectively focus on communica tion / relationship skills rather than the complete medical interview or complete physic al examination. Different communica tion needs of parent and child pose an important challenge to relationship-\u00ad centered care in pediatrics. Even when clinicians support facilitation of child participation, parents may promote a passive child role that leads to sub-\u00adoptimal treatment. Clinicians ca n be explicit about partnering with parents and tea ch them the rationale f or the child' s active pa rticipat ion. At the same time, clinicians need to address parents' needs and call on parents' expertise and knowledge of their child. Clinicians ca n collaborate with parents to help children have a voice in medical encounters. After all, both pa rents and clinicians wa nt the best f or the child. Strategies that engage the child's participatio n Engaging the child directly and conducting meaningful conversa tions with the child activate the child's effective participation.Address t he child by name Invite the child to state the pro blem \"Emma, why have you come to see me today?\" Check o ut the video example that role-\u00admodels taking the history from a 2 year old child. Enco urage the child to participate in the co nversat ion Verbally: direct questions to the child Alex, has anything else been bothering you? How about your ears? Kelly, how long have you had a runny nose? Alice, can you put your finger right where it hurts? Non-\u00adverbally: eye-\u00adconta ct, nodding, smiling at child Give advice and explain treat ment plans to the child in wo rds they can understand Provide parents with a ro le mo del for subsequent interactio ns by conversing directly wit h the child 4-\u00adyea r-\u00adold Jonathan: \"I'm so scared, my eyes are Clinician: \"I understand. It' s okay to be scared and to cry. Lots of kids are scared of shots and don't like shots. All kids who a re 4 years old have to have 2 shots. The shots help keep you well. Jonathan' s mother: \"Remember when Molly [Jonathan's f riend] got her 4 shots?\" Jonathan: \"I don't want a shot!\" Clinician: \"I know you don't want a shot. We'll do it very quickly a nd then you can pick out a sticker. You can sit in your Mom's lap.\" Clinician: \"Do you have a dog?\" how dogs pant when they're hot?\" \"Okay, your job is to pant like a dog. Let's practice. I' ll tell you when.\" While you give the shot, it sometimes helps to distra ct the child-- \"Pant like a dog!\" \"We're done! Would you like to pick out a sticker?\"Skills and Strategies that Cont ribute to Parent and Child Sat isfact ion Enhancing satisfactio n Parents highly value clinicians who attend to both their and their child' s feelings and concerns (8) who seek to understand their perspective, and who utilize better communication skills. Clinician attitudes of curiosity, humility, respect and ref lective practice (14) are likely mediators of parent satisfact ion. Parents who believe their child' s clinician is f riendly, understands their concerns, and has better communication skills, a re more satisfied.(9,10) Greater parent satisfaction is positively associated with: more active communication between clinicia n and child adequate attention to parental concerns regarding the child's illnes (11) parents' perceptions of the clinicians' ability to provide information, interpersonal sensitivity, and pa rtnership-\u00adbuilding8 In the setting of a life-\u00adlimiting condition of their child, D avies (12) found that sensitive pediatricians demonstrated the ability to understand the pa rents' perspective, were humanistic, had good technical skills, a nd sought to understand the parents' life world. Check o ut the video example where the history taking with the mother of a 5 month old child is demonstrated. Parents who changed pediatricians because of dissatisfaction perceived the pediatrician to be poorer at communica ting eff ectively.(13) Browning (14) notes tha t self-\u00adawareness a nd reflective practice are central to clinicians' compassionate communication with children and their families. He recommends that pediatricians develop a ca pacity f or reflection, and come to value curiosity, humility, a nd respect for parents' expertise that will help them better understand the child and fa mily. The child' s experiences with health care may form a life-\u00adlong attitude toward clinicians and the health care system overall. Pedia tricians have the opportunity to improve children's health behaviors. Develo pmen tal St ages o f Children Child development Communication with children (and parents) improves if clinicians understand a nd respect the differences ref lected in the stages of child development. \"Why do we have necks to keep our heads up?\" -\u00ad Jonathan, age 4 \"Do teeth bleed?\" - Anna, age 5 \"Does your heart g o on vacation?\" - Carlos, age 7 (15) Children constantly cha nge and their perspective varies by developmenta l stage, including aspects related to their cognitive, social, a nd emotional development. (16,17) The clinician af firms a nd supports good parenting, and acknowledges and teaches about developmental milestones and child development. The table below presents information about children's cognitive development and their concepts of illness at different developmental stages. Table 1. Children's co gnitive develo pment and co ncept s of illness at different ages. Prescho ol children (3 - 5 years)Schoo l-\u00adaged children (6 - 12 years)Adolescent s ( 13 years) Cognitive development Magical thinking;circular reasoning Sees 1 or 2 aspects at a time; may ignore the who le of the situation Doesn't differentiate well between self and outside world; lives in the immediate environment Emergence of clear differentiation between self and others Begins to think relationally and to generalize Begins to integrate variables in causal relationships, and to reverse these relationships Capable of cognitive problem solving and decision-\u00admaking Ability to think abstractly and hypothetic ally Uses generalization to fill in gaps in knowledge Child's concept of the cause o f illness Doesn't spontaneously conceptualize the internal parts of the body Illness results from wrongdoing; medical procedures are seen as a punishment Illness is caused by external concrete phenomenon: contagion, magic, \"from the sun\", \"from outside\" Can distinguish what is internal and external to self Cause of illness is a person, object, or action external to the child: \"you get a cold from not wearing a hat\"; \"you breathe too much air in your nose.\" Integrates multiple factors in understanding illness; imagines alternativepossibilities Cause of illness lies in internal physiologic organ or process; may have additional psychologica l cause Understands illness as internal systems that dysfunction and cause external symptoms: \" a virus gets into thebloodstream and causes a cold.\"Appro aches to Children at Different Stages Different developmental stages bring about different needs for both the child and family members, a nd require va ried interviewing, examina tion, and counseling approaches.(18) Placement of the child in the room, play strategies, relationship building stra tegies, and history taking are important variables.

D espite the extraordina ry scientif ic and technological advances in modern medicine, the core skills a nd sine qua non for the delivery of quality health care remain thoseof maintaining good relationships and skillfully communicating. Create and sust ain a relatio nship wit h the patient and family A therapeutic and communicative relationship with the pa tient is the cornerstone of competent medical care. B uilding and susta ining relationships with children a nd their fa mily members remains an ongoing ta sk within all encounters. Check o ut the video example about the examination of an 8 day old child. Components that underlie an effective clinician-\u00adparent-\u00adchild relationship include: attention to the child as a person, attention to the child's and family's values, motiva tion, and thoughts, and attention to the way each f amily member experiences the child' s illness. Other important building blocks of effective relationship tha t will be explored in subsequent sections include respect, positive regard, empathy, listening skills, nonverbal communica tion, and understanding the role of play with children. The relationship is, after all, a sha red experience. Framewo rks fo r describing skills and co mpet encies Use specif ic relationship-\u00adcentered skills or competencies to create therapeutic relationships with patients and families. These include: being \"present\" and listening attentively, opening the interview; learning about the patient as a person; empathy and compassion; non-\u00adverbal activity; and play with children. Clinicians who reflect on their own thoughts and feelings, and are mindful of what they bring to the encounter, enhance the effectiveness of their skills. Severa l useful frameworks and descriptions of interperson al and communica tion skills a nd relationship-\u00adcentered ca re exist. Three usef ul models include: 1. The Kalamazoo Consensus Statement (19) identifies seven essential communication competencies, with sub-\u00adcompetencies for each, applicable to most medical encounters and adaptable across specialties, settings, and health issues. This S tatement is the underlying structure for D ocCom. (for more info see LINK 1 on the bottom of this page) 2. Rider and Keef er,(20) with an international group of medical education leaders, expanded the ACGME interpersonal a nd communication skills competencies, added 20 sub-\u00ad competencies a nd created a teaching toolbox. Their teaching toolbox connects these competencies to tea ching strategies at each level of medical education. Check the second LINK on the bottom of this page to see the list of skills in this model that pertain to the ability to create and sustain a relationship tha t is therapeutic f or children a nd supportive of their fa milies.3. Similarly, the Ambulatory Pediatrics Association, with help from 300 pediatric experts, developed guidelines f or education in pedia tric residencies.(21) including suggestions f or building relationships with patients and fa milies. See Link 3 on the bottom for further info. LINK 1: The Kalamazoo Consensus Statement \"essentia l\" competencies were developed by a group of North American experts in clinic ian-\u00adpatient communication including DocCom authors: Tom Campbell, Kathy Cole-\u00adKelly, Michael Goldstein, Geoff Gordon, Dennis Novack, Elizabeth Rider, and Robert Smith. The competencies include: building the patient-doctor relationship; opening the discussion; gathering information; understanding the patient's perspective; sharing information; reaching agreement on problems and pla ns; and providing clos ure. These competencies are presented in Modules 06 - 12 of D ocCom. LINK 2 : The following skills comprise the ability to create a nd sustain a relationship that is therapeutic f or patients and supportive of their f amilies*: 1. Be \"present,\" paying attention to the patient, caring f or the patient, and working collaboratively a nd from strengths. 2. Accept and explore the patient's f eelings, including negative f eelings. 3. Provide a sustainable relationship tha t allows f or repa ir when mista kes a re made, and includes a uthenticity, honesty, admission of, and sorrow for, mistakes. 4. Communicate with the pa tient's family honestly and supportively. The clinician-\u00adpa tient relationship in pediatrics is imbedded in and extends to the family.

It suggests building relationships with patients and families with sensitivity, tact, and empathy by doing the following*: 1. Greet patients and families and show interest in them as individua ls. 2. Demonstrate empathy and compassion with patients and families. 3. Use words that show ca re and concern throughout the interview. 4. Use tone, pa ce, eye contact and posture to show ca re and concern. 5. Be aware that ideas, feelings, and values of both the clinician and patient influence the relationship. 6. Understand that building relationships with a patient is an ongoing task within and across encounters. 7. Respond to patients and families non-\u00adjudgmentally and non-\u00addefensively. 8. Respect and be aware of patients' privacy and confidentiality. The Ambulatory Pediatric Association communica tion skills guidelines were developed by Elizabeth Rider and others, and were drawn, in part, from the Kalamazoo Consensus Statement framework. *Adapted from: Table of core pediatric goa ls assigned to competency domains.

Available online: www.ambpeds.org/egweb . URL: http://www.ambpeds.org/EGWEB NEW/Pcomp/docs/CoreGoa lstable082205.pdf Opening the interview Rapport is a primary component of building a relationship with patients, a nd the clinician begins building rapport from the opening moments. Rapport requires mutual interest and respect between the clinician, child and pa rent. In pediatrics, a va riety of individua ls may accompany the patient - e.g., siblings, one or both parents, grandparents, other relatives, guardian, or the nanny. To establish a positive context for the interview, open the interview with an inclusive introduction a nd greeting, a cknowledge everyone in the room, use their names, and find out how they are related to the patient. Greet and welcome the child. Even with infa nts, the clinician can smile and interact with the infant for severa l seconds. This a lso gives the clinicia n a moment to assess the patient. Clinician to infant: \"Look at you! You're getting to preschooler: \"Hi! How are you today?\" Welcome the child, even if initia lly resistant, as we see with 2-\u00adyear-\u00adold Ryan \"No doctor! No doctor!\" exclaims my next patient, his small hands pressed tightly over his ears, a determined scowl on his f ace. Ryan is 2 yea rs old. I smile at him and say \"Hi.\" \"No doctor!\" he replies. After talking with his mother and letting him get used to me, I a pproach him slowly. . . . \" [p. 414] (1) Address and acknowledge siblings in the room. Siblings can be disruptive if they f eel displaced by a new baby or another sibling, so your early invitation to engage ca n have an important calming effect on the entire encounter -siblings may behave better for the rest of the interview (though this isn't alwa ys the cas e). Your invitation and leadership a lso engages and assists the parents. Clinician to sibling: \"Did you bring your baby brother today? Does he cry and ma ke lots of noise?\" \"Sometimes babies do funny things!\" Learn abo ut the patient and family Getting to know the patient and parent as individuals creates a connection that will increa se their willingness to work with you on both simple and complex i ssues. It develops a context within which to understand your patient's problems, and improves your ability to successfully manage the child's care. Effective communica tion requires an understanding of the patient in her/his world. Make a social, non-\u00admedical comment to put the patient at ease at the beginning of the visit:Check o ut the video example about the examination of a 9 month old child -\u00ad with the whole f amily there and included... Clinician t o prescho oler: \"Did you just have a birthda y? How old are you? What did you have on your birthday cake?\" (Questions a bout birthdays a re particularly eff ective with preschoolers.) \"What's your f avorite thing at preschool, not counting lunch or recess?\" \"Who lives in your house?\" Clinician t o schoo l aged child: \"What gra de are you in now?\" \"I see you've brought a book with you. What are you reading?\" \"Do you play sports?\" Find o ut who are the significant people in t he patient 's life? To child: \"Who lives in your house?\" \"Who takes of you?\" \"Tell me about your f riends.\" \"Who can you talk to if you're worried about something ?\" To parent: \"Does anyone help you out at home?\" is impo rtant to the patient? To child: \"Do you have any questions?\" \"What do you like to do with your friends?\" \"What things make you happy? sad? mad?\" \"Is there anything you are worried about?\" \"What are some things you are good at?\" To parent: \"Do you have any questions or concerns f or today?\" \"Any changes a t home or in your life since we last met?\" \"Does Maria talk with you about wha t's going on at school?\" What cont ribut es to the patient's and family' s health and well-\u00adbeing? To child: \"What do you like to do with your mom? your dad? your sister or brother?\"To pa rent: \"What sorts of things do you do together as a family?\" \"What are your child care arrangements? How are they working?\" \"Do you get time f or yourself?\" Sick children af fect the entire fa mily. If a child has been up all night crying f rom an earache, the parents are likely to be exhausted and worried. Clinician to parent: \"You must have been up all night too.\" \"I imagine you are tired.\" Note: Many risks to children's health and development are preventa ble, and comprehensive health promotion and prevention are major aspects of pedia tric practice. The B right Futures national health promotion initiative provides a practical, developmental approach for primary health care for children and adolescents. B right Futures materials cover many topics including: health supervision guidelines; recommendations on routine heath screening, anticipatory guidance and immunizations; and tools to help families and clinicians support healthy social and emotional development, monitor psychosocial development, and to identify early behavioral and emotional problems. Questions to address with fa milies a re provided. For more information, a ccess the Bright Futures website. URL: http://www.brightf utures.org/ . Empathy and co mpassio n Clinicians should show empathy and compassion in every encounter with patients.(22) The ability to convey empathy is an innate human quality, expressed in nurturing of children, family, f riends, ill persons, a nd so on. The ability may be stifled or hidden by the demands of learning the science of medicine and other procedura l skills of doctoring. Rekindling the ability or fostering it in a professional environment requires specif ic intention to do so. The ef fort ca n be aided by learning a set of skills(23). The ability to convey empathy in infinitely diverse and complex medical interview situations requires a mindf ul approa ch to encounters, listening to feedback and continuing practice. (Modules 2, 6,13) \"Empathy is the clinicia n's ability to understand the patient's s ituation, perspective, a nd feelings a nd to communicate that understanding to the patient,\" (page 221)(24) such that the patient feels understood.(25) Empathy is different than sympathy. Sympa thy occurs when the clinician listens to the patient's story from the clinician' s point of view. Empathy occurs when the clinician listens to the patient's story from the patient's point of view. Check o ut the video example about the examination of a 9 month old child -\u00ad with the whole f amily there and included...Compassion is a powerful component of the clinician-\u00adpatient relationship. Compassion means 'with passion' , with caring, with the need to ease the patient's suf fering. It is consciousness of the patient's distress together with a desire to alleviate that distress. Compa ssion takes seriously the reality of other persons, their inner lives, emotions, experience of illness, and external circumstances. Empathy helps the child and family to feel validated, respected, and understood. Studies suggest an association between the clinician' s caring and empathy, and the effectiveness and appropriateness of ca re as well a s patient satisfaction(26) Conveying empathy effectively increases diagnostic a ccuracy and pa tient adherence, yet remains time-\u00adeff icient.(27,28) Empathy increases clinicia n satisfaction.(29) Conveying Empathy and Co mpassio n Conveying empathy requires that the clinician receives or perceives emotions a nd clues to emotions a s a first step and, as a second step, responds to them in ways that the patient and family can perceive. Children express their emotions in varied ways. When they do not express them directly by, crying or having a temper t antrum, or by clinging, they may offer us clues. Much of empathic communication is subtle, and subject to cultural dif ferences, particularly in its non-\u00adverbal elements. Because of this subtlety, empathy ma y be lost because clinicians may be preoccupied with the cognitive work of organizing very complex da ta about diagnosis and treatment, while patients are preoccupied with confusion, worry, politenes s or other social rules for medical encounters. The words we use with patients help us to pick up on the patient's clues a nd to elicit and respond to their emotions. What we say may promote empathic discussion, or miss it, or actually terminate it. Clinicians ca n attend to connectedness and relationship, and remain empathic in spite of the obstacles by exercising basic empathic skills that include the following:(30) Recognize when the child or parent has emotions that a re present but not directly expressed in words. The child may hide behind the examination table, or cling to a parent. A parent may appear stone-\u00adf aced or distra cted, look away or down, in some way brea k the engagement of the conversation, or say something not related to the current conversation. Invite exploration of unexpressed f eelings. With a younger child, one might comment: \"Sometimes kids feel scared when they come to the doctor and have to have a shot.\" With older children, we can a sk: \"Are you worried?\" \"How are you doing right now?\" \"What are you feeling sca red about?\" With the parent, we can a sk: \"What are you most concerned about?\" or note: \"You look skeptical.\" Explicitly acknowledge and accept feelings. Showing the child and parent that you are trying to understand helps them to feel understood. \"You seem worried by all this, which is pretty common in this situation.\" Accept children's expressions of upset or grief. Crying usually brings relief and can be helpful to the child. D on't overreact to tears or other upset actions; do not tell children not to cry; do not try to distra ct children from their f eelings. Ignore temper tantrums. Additio nal Strategies that facilit ate conveying empat hy (31) Possessing a toolbox of strategies to promote empathic communication promotes your efficiency and enhances patient satisfaction. Questio ns: \"Can you tell me more?\" \"Is there this been like for you?\" \"Were you scared?\" Reflectio ns of the content and checking in about what the patient is saying: \"What I am hearing is . . . Do I have it right?\" \"I want to make sure I'm understandin g what you are telling me.\" \"It sounds like you think . . .\" \"Did I leave a nything \"That sounds really hard.\" \"It t might feel . . .\" \"You must f eel proud about that. That' s great!\" \"You were really bra ve. Good for you!\" \"I can see that that is bothering you.\" \"It's okay to cry. No one likes to have a shot.\" Use effect ive listening skil ls Clinicians demonstrate eff ective listening by ref lecting, summarizing and checking whatever seems odd or unusual in the context, so that the patient apprecia tes the attempts to understand, a nd can correct or add information tha t completes the picture. \"I suspect that the most basic and powerful way to connect to another person is to listen. Just listen. Perhaps the most important thing we ever g ive each other is our attention. And especially if it's given from the heart.. . . . We connect through listening.\" (p. 143)(32) Check o ut the video example: as in any clinical interview you will see relationship building and other communica tion skill competencies ca rried out in conjunction with history taking and other interview tasks. The interviews, physical examinations and their scrolled list of skill labels selectively focus on communica tion / relationship skills rather than the complete medical interview or complete physic al examination. Active listening skills enable the clinician to hear and address the concerns of children and their families. Ef fective listening skills fa cilitate relationship20, and help patients understand that better care derives f rom collaboration between clinician and patient. Listening inattentively or without mindfulness can lea d to diagnostic and treatment decisions that are incorrect at bes t and dangerous a t worst.Shortly after 9/11, I saw an Arab American fa ther and his 5-\u00adyear-\u00adold daughter in our office. S he had a viral rash, and her father repeatedly asked if she had chicken pox, even af ter I expla ined why she did not. Listening to his persistent and anxious questions, and understa nding them as a clue, I asked, \"Are you concerned about anything else?\" \"Does she have smallpox?\" the f ather asked. Only af ter he verbalized this underlying concern was I able to effectively provide reassurance, and he expressed his gratitude and relief. Non-\u00adverbal co mmunicat ion Mindful nonverba l communica tion helps develop an environment of trust, support, a nd comfort. \"Nonverba l\" includes body language a s well as tone, pace and pitch of speaking. Nonverbal cues of inattention or distraction a re more powerful than the words you sa y. Congruence between words, voice chara cteristics and body language is essential for effective communication. To focus the interview on the patient as well as the illness, and to show interest in the pa tient as a person, the clinicia n must demonstrate, non-\u00adverbally, that what the patient has to say is important. Use non-\u00adverbal cues such as nodding, pausing, maintaining eye contact, and posture to show attentiveness and concern. (M14) Check o ut the video example: the interviews, physical examinations and their scrolled list of skill labels selectively focus on communica tion / relationship skills rather than the complete medical interview or complete physical examination. Strategies f or nonverbal communication tha t promote connectedness and cooperation: Establish eye contact with the infant and child from across the room. Chat with the parents while the child becomes more comfortable with your presence. Sit down, and respect the child's personal distance. If your face is too close to an infa nt's face, she may look away and cry. Toddlers do not want anyone unfamiliar in their personal space. A good strategy is to look away when you are close (e.g., listening to hea rt and lungs). Approach school-\u00adaged children calmly and respectf ully. Adults appea r large to small children. Make yourself appea r less threatening by sitting at the child's eye level or having the child sit on a high examination table with the parent nearby. Adapt your own pace, tone a nd posture in response to the child and pa rent. Tone and pace of speech sometimes communicate f eelings more ef fectively tha n the words themselves. Sometimes young children are frightened a bout being examined. I ask the parent to hold the child in their lap, and I sit at the child's eye level. When I listen to the child's lungs, for example, I slow my rate of speech and may whisper,\"Do you have Elmo back here? Or B ig Bird? . . . \" A young child often calms to a gentle, quiet approach.Avoid interruptions of patient visits. This includes interruptions f rom phone calls and beepers. D o not try to read the chart or use the computer while listening or talking with the child and family Children and play Play is a n integral component of healthy child development and learning. An effective strategy for communicating with young children is through the metaphor of play. Through play, children explore the world, gain understanding of themselves and others and communicate wi th peers and adults. As you observe young children pla y, you will see family-\u00ad related themes, a ction plans for helping and healing, and for avoiding threats. Children use play to learn about the world and to explore their abilities to cope with its complexities. Children' s play becomes increasingly more varied and complex as they grow. (click here to see Table 2 on D evelopmental Stages of Children) When examining young children, creating a playful a tmosphere helps the pediatrician complete necessary tasks and adds enjoyment f or both the child and the clinician. \"No doctor! No doctor!\" exclaims my next patient, his small hands pressed tightly over his ears, a determined scowl on his face. Ryan is 2 years old. I smile at him and say \"Hi.\" \"No doctor!\" he replies. . . . . (p. 414) (1) The interview proceeds pla yfully with the pediatrician asking: \"Where is your heart? Is it here?\" \"Do you birthday cake in your tummy?\" \"Let's check! \" \"Do you have bunny rabbits in your ears?\" \"Which ear should we check f irst?\" The examina tion concludes: When he realizes our time is up, he lags, pulling on his mother's arm so he can remain in the examination room. \"More doctor! More doctor!\" he exclaims. (p. 414; f or a description of the f ull examination see reference (1)) Understand the child's and parent's perspective Understanding the patient's perspective includes understanding the child' s and family' s individua l concerns, beliefs, and expectations, and respecting their cultural a nd ethnic beliefs, practices, and langua ge. (20) The child' s perspectiv e depends upon her or his developmental stage.(M9) \"When I cough my brain shakes.\" - 3-\u00adyear-\u00adold Ethan describing his headache \"It feels like bees are in there.\" - 7-\u00adyear-\u00adold Eliza describing her ear ache \"Are deer ticks carnivores?\" - 4-\u00adyear-\u00adold Michael with questions af ter being brought to the pediatrician f or a tick bite Check o ut the video example: The 8 year old girl shows insight and concern. How does the child and f amily experience the child's illness? What are the child' s ideas about their illness? Listen to the patient's or family's story, elicit their understanding of the causes of illness and possible treatments, and identify their major concerns. Ask about life events, circumstances, and other people that mig ht affect health. Elicit expectations about illness and treatment. \"What do you think has caused the problem?\" \"What concerns you the most about your child's illness?\" Children reveal clues to their concerns a nd perspective through their questions a nd comments. \"Does your heart g o on vacation?\" 7-\u00adyear-\u00adold Carlos asked during his yearly checkup. Af ter further discussion it becomes clear that Carlos is pondering the concept of death.(33) David, age 10, wa s hit in the leg with a baseball. During the visit, his mother expressed her concerns about his future f ertility, and was reassured to learn that David was unharmed. Following a discussion of puberty, hormones, and the changes that occur as bodies grow, the following dialogue ensued between David and his pediatrician: As we wrap up the visit, I a sk him, \"Do you have any more questions?\" \"No,\" he replies, \"I figured it out.\" \"What did you figure out?\" I ask. \"Girls attract hormones,\" he concludes. (p.792)(34) You can also a sk the child and pa rent to articulate their emotions (e.g., \"You seem worried; is that right?\") and respond explicitly to their expressed ideas and feelings. After a three-\u00adyear-\u00adold well-\u00adchild visit, Sarah's mother shares tha t Sarah has seemed anxious and worried since the 9/11 terrorist attacks. We talk further. I kneel down to S arah's eye level and tell her \"your mommy is safe, your daddy is saf e, and you are safe\". She looks at me with big, attentive eyes a nd I know I have connected. With solemn seriousness, she slowly pulls her lollipop out of her mouth and says, with great emphasis, \"And my kitty cat.\" \"Yes, your kitty cat is sa fe too.\" (p. 531)(35) Sharing info rmat ion Because clinicians contend with life and death, the power and impact of words is magnified, and pa tients and worried pa rents can be easily frightened by careless word choices, especially about prognosis. Share diagnostic and treatment information gently and use words that are easy for the patient to understand. Intersperse the telling of information with asking about understandin g and impact. Patients highly value these gestures of respect, dignity and consideration. Check o ut the video example where the physica l exam on a 5 month old child is demonstrated. Clinicians who understand a child's developmental and cognitive perspective and use this knowledge when sharing information, provide better communica tion, better relationship a nd better care. 3-\u00adyear-\u00adold Victoria , her infant brother, and her parents came to the office several weeks after Victoria 's 20-\u00admonth-\u00adold br other, Sean, had died of a congenital disease. It was a busy weekend day with patients scheduled every 10 minutes. While I examined her infant brother, Victoria hid near the examination table a nd occasionally peeked out. Her parents and I talked about Sean' s death and how they were coping. Victoria 's mother commented that Victoria repeatedly asked, \"Where is Sean?\" and tha t she had become increasingl y clingy and would not let her parents out of her sight. After further discussion about young children' s view of death, and their cognitive inability to see it as permanent, I noted, \"I think two things are going on that a re common reactions 3 yea r olds have when someone has died.\" \"Victoria may fear that, because Sean disappea red, either parent could do the same.\" I explained the need to repeatedl y and concretely reassure Victoria that, even though Sean went away, her mother and f ather, and her baby brother were not going to go away, even when she was bigger. We also discussed the fa ct tha t 3 year olds have an egocentric view of the world and tend to think that things happen because of them\u2014for example, Sean's death. \"You can reassure her that it's not her fault that Sean died, tha t it happen ed because he was very sick with a sickness she a nd her baby brother and her parents did not have and could never get.\" During this discussion, I also spoke directly to Victoria, modeling the conversation her parents could have with her. Victoria emerged from her hiding place, first moving behind her mother, then moving more freely around the examination room, and finally initia ting conversation with me. Partner with pat ient and family The clinician-\u00adpatient relationship is a partnership. When working with children, create an atmosphere of mutuality and respect by inviting active patient and family collaboration throughout the encounter, with particula r attention to involving them in decision-\u00admaking. To pa rtner with patients (19,20): Invite them to help establish the agenda for encounters (Module 5, 7.) Check for mutual understa nding of inf ormation about diagnosis and treatment. (Module 10) Collaborate in negotiation about diagnostic and treatment options and the establishment of mutually acceptable diagnostic and treatment plans Include the child (as appropriate) and f amily in choices and decisions to the extent they desire. (Module 11, 17) Adopt a relationship-\u00adcentered perspective. Effective communication between clinician, child and family is always a two-\u00adway, reciprocal process that involves flexibility in interaction and relationship development between human beings, rather than simply the collection of facts and establish ment of diagnosis and treatment. NOTE: Children' s Emotional Health Link (CEHL) is designed to provide clinicia n training in psychosocial pediatrics, to improve clinician-\u00adpatient communication and to help doctors and nurses become more skillf ul in assessing emotional problems in children. CEHL uses a \"strength-\u00adba sed\" rather than pathology-\u00adbased a pproach. The website http://www.cehl.org contains thoughtful articles f or parents, pediatricians, and other health professionals as they work together to improve the emotional health of children. SUMMARY Building and susta ining relationships with children and their family members is an ongoing task that includes a set of skills that can be improved with knowledge and practice. Communication between clinicia n, child and family involves conve rsation and relationship between human beings rather tha n simply the exchange of f acts. A therapeutic and communicative relationship with the patient and fa mily is the cornerstone of competent pediatric care. Children are not small adults. They present their chief complaint in unique ways stating: \"I have bees in my ears.\" \"When I cough, my brain shakes.\" And they ask questions like: \"Do teeth bleed?\" \"Can you check my mom to see if she's going to have another baby?\" The pediatric interview is inf luenced by the cognitive and developmental state of the child a nd changing f amily roles. Children see the world differently a t different developmental stages and ages. Younger children communicate through the metaphor of play. Your history and examina tion will be different with children of different ages. Working with parents and families is an important component of pediatric ca re. The pediatric interview routinely involves the doctor-parent-child triad and other family members. The pediatric interview encompasses not only medical concerns; more a nd more children are seen f or behavioral and developmental problems, especia lly in prima ry care.We can have meaningful conversations with children. Studies show that direct communica tion between clinicia n and child contributes to improved relationships, sa tisfaction with care, and better health outcomes.

What experiences a nd behaviors do you remember from your adolescence that might help you empathize with adolescent patients? 2. Looking back, ca n you recall some clinicians' chara cteristics that helped you decide to trust them? 3. Might some of your current attitudes a bout adolescents interfere with your building trusting relationships with them? 4. Why did most of us engage in one or more risky beha viors as adolescents and young adults? 5. What f actors make it simpler or harder f or teens to stop risky behaviors; or to adopt health-\u00ad promoting beha viors? 6. What f actors give caregivers a unique opportunity to help teens adopt less risky beha viors? 7. What is most complex or intimida ting for you about colla borating jointly with teens and their parents? Key Principles: 1. A specif ic focus of adolescent medical interviews is to explore and reduce risky behaviors. 2. Every teen has some strengths, competencies, and inherent resilience.3. Healthcare professionals who explicitly recognize and apprecia te teens' dilemmas and strengths build a zone of safety that facilitates effective conversations about beha vior change. 4. Collaborative dialog tha t explores linkages between stress a nd risk-\u00adbehavior sets the stage for consideration of behavior change. 5. Partnering with parents and teens in brainstorming alternative ways to adapt to stress is a prerequisite to guiding patients towards more healthy behaviors. 6. In the special case of medically unexplained symptoms (somatization), clinicians can assist through compassiona te conversation that explores connections between stress, brain and body chemistry and symptoms. Learning go als: At the co nclusion o f this mo dule, yo u will be able to : Describe the health impact of exploring the psychosocial a nd environmental context of adolescent beha viors. Utilize trust-\u00adbuilding communication strategies to promote open, honest and mutually respectful colla borative communication with a dolescent patients. Establish a collaborative dialog with teens as active participants in the health promoting process (do not make them passive recipients of lectures they are likely to reject!) Encourage teens to mediate change in risk-\u00adbehavior by building on their strengths. Compassionately explore how stress drives risk-\u00adbehaviors a nd how the mind-\u00adbody connection generates somatic symptoms. Partner with patients in brainstorming and utilizing alternative strategies to mana ge their stress. WHAT MAKES ADOLESCENT MEDICINE UNIQUE? Fully 80% of what kills adolescents is preventable. Risk-\u00adbehaviors are teens' responses to stress a nd are amena ble to counseling. The problem of unexplained somatic symptoms is common a nd distressing, and also usually a response to stress. This module outlines stra tegies to address risk-\u00adbehaviors and somatization through respectful exploration, using a strength-\u00ad based counseling paradigm. Take even a perf unctory glimpse a t morbidity and mortality statistics, and you will understand that if we are to save adolescent lives and preserve health, we must do more than evaluate their presenting physica l complaints. Few adolescents visit clinicia ns' offices with the in tention of discussing the risky behaviors that lead to 80% of deaths in the 14-\u00ad24 age group. Furthermore, addressing key subjects such as alcohol, suicide, sexuality and safety is a daunting task f or providers. Advances in understa nding young peoples' stressors a nd anxieties as well a s consideration of clinicians' role in adolescent healthca re have prompted changes in both the goals of medical interviews a nd in strategies for successful interventions. The traditional \"at-\u00adrisk\" questions about sex, drugs, anxiety, etc. position the clinicia n as adversary ra ther than advoca te, because every young person antici pates a \"lecture\" to follow. Not only does such an approach f ail to inspire honest answers, thoughtful consideration, or behavior change, but also many youth f eel off ended, judged or shamed by it, thus reducing the open-\u00admindedness required to explore risks or initiate behavior change. As medical professionals who ca re for adolescents, we can position ourselves as advocates. As we discover what these y oung people are doing right in their lives, we can better help them develop confidence and a sense of competency. We need to move beyond telling them what not to do, and instead reinf orce healthy behaviors in which they are already engaging and respectfully guide them to explore new capabilities that are based on their pre-\u00adexisting strengths. In this module, we discuss concrete relationship-\u00adcentered approaches to facilitating respectful, honest and saf e communication with teens. We orga nize the adolescent visit into three phases, Setting the Stage, Eliciting the Medical and Psychosocial History, and Strength-\u00adBased Counseling. We emphasize that adolescent stress is the central driver for many risk behaviors, and f or somatization. We present tools f or eliciting and exploring sources of stress, f or coordinating a strength-\u00adbased a pproach to advising and counseling, with example dialogues and conversations. SETTING THE STAGE Enable honest communication by expla ining to teens why you will ask persona l questions, what you will do with confidential information, and what benefits teens derive from choosing to share honestly with you. Spending 3-\u00ad4 minutes on stage-\u00adsetting builds trust, shortens subseque nt encounters and smoothes the way if clarifications become necessa ry later on. Adolescents, like a dults, a re hesitant to disclose personal information unless they trust and respect the questioner. Typically they ask the following questions: (1) Why is the clinicia n asking me personal questions? (2) What if I don't wa nt to discuss this information now? (3) Is it worth my time sharing private informati on; can this person even help me if I ever need it? (4) What will he or she do with the answers; will I be judged or have my business spread around? Prepare teens for the visit and fa cilitate honest dialogue throughout the visit by telling the youth what to expect, using a four-\u00adstep strategy we call \"Setting the Stage.\" \"Setting the Stage\" should not take longer than 2-\u00ad3 minutes and should be done a t the beginning of every new patient encounter and when a patient turns 11 or 12. Taking 2-\u00ad3 minutes in a visit limited to 10-\u00ad15 minutes is substantial. However, spending the time up front saves time later and also improves relationships a nd the quality of information about sensitive topics. Failing to do so generates uncertainty a nd confusion and wa stes time if a teen seems unwilling to open up. Stage-\u00adSetting: Why \"perso nal questio ns\"? Teens respond positively to explana tions that demonstrate respect. Help patients understand why you will a sk questions about their \"private\" life. S tudies show that teens are more likely to share personal information when clinicians thoughtfully explain how these data relate to their healthcare (Ginsburg, 1997). Consider beginning the encounter by saying,\"I'm a doctor; my job is to save lives and help patients stay healthy. I worry a bout many things like sore throats and sprained ankles, but also about thing s like violence, drugs, stress, and depression. Do you agree tha t doctors should worry about these things?\" Stage-\u00adSetting: Talk abo ut auto nomy and ho nesty Teens value honesty and freedom to choose what to say. Particula rly in the situation of meeting the clinician for the first time, youth seldom wish to discuss everything going on in their lives. Show respect for their autonomy by acknowledging that they can choose wha t to discuss, and also acknowledge the importance of honest disclosure. \"You can a sk me anything and I'll be honest. I' d like to talk with you about those things I just mentioned, and I need for you to be honest with me. I'll work with you to help you explore ways to stay healthy a nd safe, right now and wheneve r you need me in the future.\" \"Just because I a sk you a question, though, doesn' t mea n you have to answer it. I'd rather you say: ' I don't wa nt to talk about that today' than give me an answer that is not true.\" \"Remember, I don' t read minds. If you tell me something that isn't truthf ul, I won' t know. B ut I also won' t be able to help you or answer your questions about a subject you may really want to talk about.\" Stage-\u00adSetting: Talk about benefits of trust Teens value trusting relationships. Whether patients will benef it from sharing private information is a concern for everyone. This is a big issue f or teens, but they seldom have a conscious awareness of it and so explicit reassurance about the benef its of a relationship based on mutual trust is helpf ul. They may have little knowledge about how a clinician can be helpful now and in the future, pa rticularly if they do not perceive current needs. Assure the teen that the current and future benefits of trusting you with personal inf ormation include both enabling you to answer difficult questions truthf ully and enabling you to provide help for complex situations and dilemmas in an unbiased fashion. \"My job is to help my patients and I, along with t he team I work with, know how to do this. Of course it is ha rd to open up to someone you don't know well, but I want you to know that I am here to help you in any way I can. Stage-\u00adSetting: Talk about co nfidentialit y Teens value privacy and confidentiality - especially with regard to parents. The most critical barrier to open communication f or youth is the worry about how much doctors can tell their pa rents. Simila rly, youth a re also concerned about confidentiality within the office,as some off ice staff live in their community (Ginsburg, 1997). Few adolescents are aware that state laws protect their right to privacy. Youth benef it from guidance in understanding the nuances of doctor-\u00adpatient confidentiality (Ford, 1997; Ford 2001; English 2007). Be specific about what confidentiality means, and under what circumstances it may need to be broken. Avoid using the standa rd phrase, \"I will keep your information secret (or confidential) unless I a m worried you will hurt yourself, hurt someone else, or if an adult is hurting you.\" Using the word \"hurt \" (instead of \"kill\", below) leads adolescents to think their clinicia n will report smoking, drugs, and sex, all of which they expect doctors think \"hurt\" them. Furthermore, using \"secret\" or \"confidential\" could backf ire because teens attach shame to the word \"secret\", a nd misconstrue \"confidential\" as \"confidence\". Instead, use the word \"privacy\", and when discussing \"confidentiality\", state its limits clearly. Communicate with youth that in the case of a crisis when confidentiality should be broken, they will be involved in strategizing how to best manage the safety concern. \"The most important thing for you to know is that what you talk about with your doctors in considered private information. I know you are worried about who I may tell if you tell me something that is going on in your life. I have to keep your information private; I cannot tell anybody without your permission; not your parents or other people in the office unless they are the doctors or nurses involved in your care. There are laws that protect privacy. This is called 'confidentiality' and doctors have to uphold it for every single patient.\" \"There are three situa tions when I have to break this promise: if your life were in danger because (1) you were going to kill yourself or (2) kill someone else or (3) if someone was abusing you. In these cases, I have to get help right away because your life is in danger. Does this make sense?\" Stage-\u00adSetting: Repeat key wo rds; remind Teens value reassurance that their clinicia ns will do what they have promised. Before asking about sensitive matters later in the interview, repetition of key words such as \"personal questions\", \"choice in a nswering\", \"honesty\", or \"private information\" provides additional reassurance and saf ety. Furthermore, in f ollow-\u00adup visits a brief mention of these key words re-\u00ad creates the atmosphere of trust and enables honest communication. \"Jasmine, I want to remind you about some important things I stressed to you last time we met. You always have a choice in answering my questions when I ask you about personal matters and how your life is going. I hope you can be honest with me, because I want to help you in any way I can, and I am not here to judge you. Remember that whatever we talk about is \"confidential\" and that means I have to keep your information private and I cannot talk about you with anyone, including your parents, our office staff or other doctors or nurses, unless the they are also helping take care of you. Do you remember the three situa tions I cannot uphold this trust? If you are thinking of killing yourself, killing another person or if someone is abusing you. If any of those things are going on, I have to get you help right away.\" Video is loadin g Oana Tomescu MD, PhD, is setting the stage in this movie Set t he Stage with Parents Provide anticipatory guidance to parents by partnering with them. Build trusting relationships by acknowledging their unique and changing role and by emphasizing the balance between confidentiality / privacy a nd safety. Parents often accompany adolescents, and they carry their a dult and parental concerns regarding risks and safety. Teens a re seldom willing to participate op enly in discussions a bout sex, substances, stress a nd so on in the presence of a parent. Thus, clinicians should balance time that includes parents against solo time with patients. In case of future crisis, team-\u00adbased interventions can be more easily coordina ted if the clinician has developed a partnership with both teen and parent (Ford, 2009). Fa cilitate the parent-\u00adpartnering process with explana tions a nd reassurances similar to those used in building trust with patients. Check o ut the video example a bout emphasizing the role of the parents. When a sked to leave the room, many parents will feel left out of discussing the issues about which they are most concerned (i.e. violence, safety, sex, and drugs). Coordinating and balancing private and joint time can be dif ficult, especially if there are conflicts between parent and teen. To the teen, reinforce your commitment to confidentiality a nd to providing a safe place where the teen can come for help, and to the parent, outline a team-\u00adoriented plan in case of crisis. Here are examples of what you can say to the parent and teen: Direct ly to the child: Now, my job is to help you, but if you were really in trouble, who could help you the most? Listen and learn from the child' s response, then redirect if necessary, with the go al of having the teen mention their primary caregiver. Yes, I think that your mom/dad/caregiver can help you the most, too. Now, I meant what I said bef ore: I promise your strict privacy, but don't be mad at me if I think you might be headed f or trouble and I sugg est we work together to figure out the best way to get your parent(s) involved. B ut don't worry I won't do it without your permission unless y our life is in danger. Direct ly to the parent : If we do come to you, I'd like f or us to work together as a team to keep your child safe. But I'd like us to agree now that if something comes up in our visits, your son/daughter would not be punished. Wonderf ul thing s can happen here if young people know this is a place they can come for help without f earing they will be punished.Parents: Explain that age changes visit fo cus Acknowledge that the pediatric to adolescent healthca re transition signif ies a change in parent role. The change is not only from being the primary medical decision maker to being \"co-\u00adma nager\" of decisions, but also f rom being the primary supplier of medical information to someone who jointly explores medical information. Naturally, the teen's role changes as well, and adolescents need assistance in becoming active participants as well a s more involved in management decisions. Direct most questions to patients, but also encourage pa rents to be careful listeners and to supply additional inf ormation when needed. Mrs. B rown, I want you to understand that another part of my job is to get Jasmine ready to see doctors all on her own. I am going to ask her for most of the information I'll need, so she can pra ctice spea king f or herself with doctors. Please let her respond first, but listen carefully, we' ll probably need you to teach her information she does not yet know. So Jasmine, if you don't know the answers to some questions pay attention to what your mom says; you'll need to know this information soon when you begin seeing doctors by yourself. Parents: Explain need t o talk alo ne Teen patients need to learn to speak for themselves with their doctors. One clinician task at this life stage is to help younger patients practice becoming more independent. This simple but explicit explanation usually helps parents be more supportive about the clinician' s request to spend time a lone with their teena ger. Mrs. B rown, once we' ve covered the medical information and discussed any concerns that you have, I'd like to speak to Jasmine by herself . She is old enoug h to be examined in private and needs to gain comfort talking to doctors alone. Before that happens thoug h, I want to make sure we address all your concerns. And as I said before, if Jasmine's life is in danger, we all need to work tog ether to help her to stay healthy and alive. Is that OK? Parents: Explain co nfidentialit y and safety Resta t e the importance to teens' health outcomes that derives f rom a commitment to balancing confidentiality and saf ety. Reassure parents that they will not be excluded if their teen is having significant health, psychological, or safety issues, but also restate your commitment to confidentiality. Jasmine, I meant what I said bef ore about protecting your medical and health information; and I also meant it that my prima ry goal is to help keep you safe and healthy. So I want you to know that if I am ever worried that you are heading for trouble, I amgoing be very honest with you about trying to get your parents involved to help. I promise, though, to always work with you to get the help you need. OK? AFTER SETTING THE STAGE Preventive interventions as well as diagnostic and trea tment efforts will f ail unless clinicians employ additional tools to build on \"stage-\u00adsetting.\" This is particularly true with youth who show discomfort or participate with reluctance. \"Setting the stage\" begins building trust because it addresses teens' concerns up front, provides them with resources in case of crisis, and allows them to evaluate clinicia ns' style, attitudes and professionalism. Of course, some youth will require additional interventions before they develop comfort in communicating honestly. Substa ntial research underscores the importance of provider interpersonal style in building trust with adolescent patients (Ma lus, 1987; Res nick, 1980; Schuster, 1996). Some patients f eel intimidated or vulnera ble because of the power dynamic inherent in the doctor-\u00adpatient relationship, others because of discomfort with unfamiliar places, people or \"authority\" f igures. Some youth use toughness and \"attitude\" as a defensive posture, testing every adult until the adult proves trustworthy. Studies indicate that youth respond to and seek pr oviders who are honest, respectf ul, ca ring, non-\u00adjudgmental, consistent, and professiona l (Ginsburg, 2002a; Ginsburg, 1995, Ulager, 2005). As an interview progresses beyond the initial stage setting, additional communication strategies can help clinicians with patients who hesitate to grant their trust. Relationship building with youth utilizes the tools of empathy - attentive listening and obse rvation of nonverbal cues accompanied by empathic verbal and non verbal responding. In addition to facilitating data-\u00ad gathering and shared decision making, empathy tools help achieve a deeper understanding of patients as whole persons, as well as their illness and life perspective (Stewart, 2001; Street, 2007; Maguire, 2002). Patient-\u00adcentered communication improves both sa tisfaction and overall health status (Mead 2002; Wanzer, 2004; Street 2009) and probably reduces dia gnostic testing and ref errals (Stewart, 2000). A simple a cknowledgement of the discomfort inherent in the power differential begins to lower communication barriers. Additional empathic interventions such a s showing interest in understanding the patient by ref lecting what is heard (or seen), normalizing situations, making partnerin g statements a nd summarizing aspects of the interview demonstrate to the patient tha t the provider is fully present in the conversation, and increase the likelihood of open and honest communication (DocCom Modules 5, 6, 13); Robertson, 2005; Laidlaw 2007; Smith 2012). The body langua ge of clinician and patient conveys positive and negative messages that powerfully improve or dampen communication. Shaking hands warmly, sitting at eye level, making eye contact and leaning slightly forward convey the intent to listen a ctively (DocCom Module 14, Maguire, 2002; Robertson, 2005). Let the patient know that note-\u00adtaking or typing is necessary, but avoid it when discussing persona l information. A teen who avoids eye conta ct, mumbles or gives one-\u00adword responses is struggling with something (D ocCom Modul e 14). Clinicians who respectfully and non-\u00adjudgmentally acknowledge such cues use reflection, legitimizing, partnering and attentive listening to demonstrate their caring attitude, their professiona l stance and their trustworthiness. See Table 3 for example communica tion strategies. THE ADOLESCENT MEDICAL HISTORY When obtaining the teen's medical history, use patient-\u00adcentered strategies and involveparents. This reinforces your trust-\u00adbuilding ef forts during stage setting and prepares participants for the more delica te psychosocial history to follow. After stage setting, gather medical history. Youth, like many adults, often adopt a step-\u00adwise \"testing\" f ormat when deciding whether to trust a clinician: they divulge a bit of information and judge the adult's reaction. If the clinicia n responds without judgment, keeps their confidence, and demonstrates a caring attitude (Ulager, 2005), teens reveal more, and do so in larger increments. Consistency in spoken words, body language, and eye conta ct demonstra tes to youths that it is safe to be open and honest. Research shows that effectively building the relationship results in better inf ormation gathering and improved health outcomes (DocCom Module 6). Use a patient-\u00adcentered interview style (D ocCom Module 5) to show patients that you can suspend judgment while attentively listening. Medical questions are perceived as less intrusive by patients, and help reinforce your prior work of building a safe and trustworthy relationship. If parents are present, include them incrementally by first querying patients a nd then asking parents to contribute additional details. The incremental strategy has multiple benef its: it provides anticip atory guidance f or youths' f uture visits without their parents; it gives parents an opportunity to teach children; it allows clinicians to observe fa mily interactions and it strengthens the team-\u00ad oriented approa ch to caring f or teens. It extends the zone of sa fety, no matter how you sequence the gathering of complete information. Af ter the medical history, guide the conversa tion towards the psychosoci al realm, and use the same incremental stra tegy. I'm going to ask your mom these questions too. I want you to listen to her answers because it is really important that you know your own and your fa mily's medical history. Soon you are going to be going to doctors by yourself a nd you'll need to be able to provide this information. Check o ut the video example a bout the medical history. PSYCHOSOCIAL HISTORY: KEYSTONE OF THE ADOLESCENT INTERVIEW Use the SSHADESS tool to elicit the psychosocial history. SSHA DESS is a dual-\u00adpurpose screening strategy that enables clinicians to learn about teens' strengths and to explore teens' current risk-\u00adbehaviors. Preventable a nd modif iable risk behaviors are the major determinants of youth mortal ity and morbidity. Thus, a careful psychosocial history must be a major interview focus, and it must not only provide information about sex, drugs, tobacco and alcohol, but also highlight teens' strengths, capabilities and current coping stra tegies. Their strengths a nd capabilities can then be enlisted to help youth avoid or modify risky behaviors. We recommend using the SSHADESS tool, which encompas ses questions about self -\u00addescribed Strengths, School, Home, Activities, Drugs, Emotions (depression and suicida lity in particula r), Sexuality and Safety. SSHADESS emphasizes Strengths and Safety, encompasses Emotions more broadly than Depression, and is an expansion of\"HEADDS\" (Clark, 1995). With parents present, ask the less intrusive questions about Strengths, School, Activities, and friends. Involve parents incrementally a nd address any parental concerns in a way that is supportive of the teen's right to privacy. Before asking the more personal questions about Drugs, Emotions, Sexua lity and Safety, ask pa rents to step out. The video a nd Table 4 present suggestions f or making this request. Check o ut the video example a bout asking pa rents to leave the room. We again emphasize the delicate nature of relationships with teens and the continual need for reassurances about safety, confidentiality and trust. A fter parents leave, re-\u00adestablish confidentiality a nd follow the general guidelines below to assure successful completion of the SSHADESS's more sensitive questions. The guidelines, which might be ref erred to as an \"outward-\u00ad in\" approa ch, give insight into the teen' s surroundings, alert the patient to what is coming next, and also allow the clinicia n to make adjustments and give reassurances that sustain the relationship, if needed. Tailor the inquiry for each patient and community Begin each inquiry with a focus on peers in school and the neighborhood Move next to the patient's f riends and lastly to the patient When the teen gives a worrisome answer, avoid a ny reaction and finish the \"general\" screen before pursuing follow up inquiry about worrisome data. Most importa ntly, withhold any \"counseling\" input until the SSHAD ESS inquiry is completed. Premature counseling disrupts patient disclosure and limits clinicia n understanding of psychosocial context and \"positive\" a nd \"nega tive\" clinician reactions may dissuade teens from disclosing worrisome behaviors, a s they may not want to \"disappoint\" the doctor. Maintain special atten tion to nonverbal signals of approval or disapproval, beca use nonverbal communications carry disproportionate strength in this circumsta nce. Listening to youths' disclosures of risk behaviors is difficult and particularly so when the youth's background is diff erent from the clinicia n's. B ecome aware of your own biases, expectations and emotions, so that you do not send mixed messages to teen patients. Relationship-\u00adbuilding is a central goa l, so do not push young persons f urther than they are ready to go. Finally, keep in mind that having as therapeutic a conversation as possible is usually more important than obtaining every detail. SSHADESS: DETAILS Below we list the SSHA DESS components. Then, in each of the pages that follow, we expand and comment on each aspect of the screen. We show example dialogue that is likely to engage patients in a positive fashion. Strengths SchoolHome Activities Drugs Emotions (depression and suicidality in particula r) Sexua lity Safety SSHADESS: Self-\u00addescribed St rengths A good transition to the SSHADESS inquiry could be something like, \"Mary, I know about your medical history now, but I also wa nt to know more about you. Why don't you tell me about yourself? How would you describe yourself?\" Some teens will be at a loss and cannot f ind words to give the clinician information about their self-\u00adimage. In this case ask, \"How ld your f riends describe you?\" Ask specif ically and directly about strengths, because this information paves the wa y for a strength-\u00adbased a pproach to subsequent behaviora l counseling: \"What is your biggest strength?\" If parents are present, include them in this conversation. SSHADESS: Scho ol School performance may reflect the teen's overa ll well-\u00adbeing, and a decline in school performa nce is often pred ictive of other problems. Additionally, youth without dreams of a future may put themselves at greater risk. Conversely, commitment to schoolwork and to academic a chievement are important protective f actors (Sege, 1999; D ekovik, 1999). Questions about school might include: \"How is school going f or you?\" \"What are your f avorite subjects?\" \"Are there any you do not like?\" \"What are your dreams for your future?\" If parents are present, include them in this conversation. SSHADESS: Ho me Knowing who lives in the home provides information a bout the youth' s general environment. Many teena gers have a tense relationship with their parents, but a more critical f act is to determine whether relationships are reaching crisis proportions. Ask about home life with the parent present, and also ask again when parents have left the room. Discovery of problems may enable you to guide fa milies towards family-\u00adbased interventions that promote more thoughtful communication and discipline techniques. Questions about f amily might include: \"How are things at home?\" \"Who lives at home?\" \"How are things going with your parents/siblings?\" If parents are present, include them in this conversation. SSHADESS: Activities Peer relationships are exceptionally important to teena gers. Knowing wha t a patient' s friends are doing offers a clue about negative pressures the patient may encounter. Youth with f ew friends and \"nothing to do\" are more likely to fill time with risky behaviors, and conversely, constructive use of free time in youth programs, or after-\u00adschool activities is protective f or youth (Lerner, 2002; Gestsdottir, 2007; Mahoney, 2000; Fredericks, 2006). Questions about activities might include : \"Tell me about your f riends?\" \"What kinds of things do you do together?\" \"What do you do after school?\" If parents are present, include them in this conversation, and then invite them to leave the room. Check o ut the video example a bout asking pa rents to leave the room. SSHADESS: Drug Use / Subst ance Use Mind altering substances contribute sharply to morbidity and mortality from injuries and violence, to school f ailure a nd depression and to the acquisition of sexually transmitted diseases. Ask general questions about the school a nd neighborhood first, then about the pa tient:\"Are there a lot of drugs in your school or neighborhood?\" \"What about alcohol or cigarettes?\" \"Have your f riends ever tried drugs, alcohol or cig arettes?\" \"Have you ever tried?\" If the teen has tried substances and especially if the teen opens up about chronic use, elucidate the reaso ns behind the drug use so a s to better understand the context before engaging in a counseling discussion. Say something like: \"Thank you for being honest with me. Can you tell me more about how often y ou are using X?\" \"Some people use X for fun, while others use it to escape some other stress in their lives. Do you ha ve a sense of what makes you use X?\" (for additional sugg estions, see the Adolescent Stress section). SSHADESS: Emo tions / Depressio n Few teens admit to f eeling \"depressed\" or \"anxious,\" sometimes because of concern about stigma associated with \"menta l illness,\" sometimes because they do not yet know what the terms mea n. But screening teens for depression and anxiety is critical, and all teens understand f eeling \"stressed-\u00adout.\" Most of them can be prompted to discuss the causes of stress and the coping strategies (either positive or negative) they have utilized. Elucidation of who the teen turns to for help gives insight into a teen's sources of support, and the unhappy youth with no one to talk to is at tremendous risk. Suicide is the third highest cause of morta lity among adolescents (CD C, 2006), so inquiry about suicide is para mount. In the weeks or months preceding a suicide attempt, many teens seek care for \"routine\" or vague health concern when unable to speak about a \"hidden agenda\" about how badly they feel (Hawton, 1982; Slap, 1989; Capelli, 1995). If any response is worrisome, carry out a more comprehensive screen, a nd consider referral to mental health services (DocCom Module 27). Questions about emotions, stress and suicide might include: \"Are you genera lly happy; how is life going f or you?\" \"When you have a bad day, what do you do?\" \"Do you have anyone to talk to when you f eel stressed out, or when you have a bad day?\" \"Do things ever g et so bad that you' ve thought about killing yourself?\" SSHADESS: Sexuality Approach the subject of sexuality with no preconceptions of level of sexual activity or of sexual orientation (Ginsburg, 2002b; Marshal, 2008; Garof alo, 1999; Remaf edi, 1998)). Some teena gers resent adult assumptions that they have had sex. Additionally, many youth are in turmoil about sexual activity, orienta tion and identity and do not have a respo nsible adult in whom they can confide. Keep pronouns gender-\u00adneutral until teens disclose the gender of their partner. Open-\u00adended and non-\u00adgender specif ic ways to ask about sexual a ctivity and orientation include: \"Are you currently dating anyone?\" \"What is the person like?\" \"Have you begun to become physical with that person; I mean kissing or touching in private places?\" \"Have you had sex with this person, or with any other person?\" \"Are you comfortable with your sexual f eelings?\" Use normalizing (legitimizing) statements to follow up on uncertainty: \"What do you mean?\" \"Some people feel g uilty about thinking about sex and others feel confused about their thoughts, that is pretty normal....\" \"Do you feel this way?\" SSHADESS: Safety Determine who is likely to be a victim or perpetrator of violence by asking about violence. Interpersonal violence is a primary concern f or many youth, and asking about it can sa ve lives. Some believe that a weapon will protect them, despite the evidence that it puts them at greater risk of death. Inquire whether the patient carries a weapon or has access to one. Further, when treating youth for violence-\u00adrelated injuries, explore whether they have plans to \"get even\"; then look for partner violence by asking about jealousy as well as physical and emotional abuse. Start with general questions and proceed to more personal ones: \"Are there a lot of fights or weapons a t your school or in your neighborhood? \"Are there weapons at home?\" \"Do your f riends carry weapons?\" \"Do you feel safe at home and at school?\" \"Do you get int o fights?\" \"What makes you mad enough to fight?\" \"Have you ever been hurt in a fight?\" \"Do you have a weapon?\" \"Do you feel your boy/girl-\u00adfriend? \"Does s/he get jealous? \"Has s/he ever hit you or made you feel bad about yourself?\" STRESSORS, RISK-\u00adBEHAVIORS AND SOMATIZATION Patients' responses to SS HADESS inquiry aids understanding of the stressors that drive teens' engagement in risk-\u00adbehaviors. In some cases, teens' adaptation to stress manifests itself as distressing and disruptive somatic / physical symptoms, referred to a s \"somatiza tion.\" Adolescence is a time of life change in all domains: physical, emotional, vocational, psychological and socia l. The SSHADESS screen's key goal is to gain a deeper understanding of stressors that patients face. The ups and downs of developmental tasks like socialization, diff erentiation and autonomy produce stress for all teens and additional stressors such as family disruption, violence, substance abuse, etc., further amplify the stresses of life cha nge. Every teen adopts behavioral strategies that serve to lessen stressf ul feelings-\u00ad some \"positive\" and others \"negative.\"(Figure 2) Note that the \"positive / negative\" label reflects culturally determined value systems -\u00ad not a strategy' s effectiveness at reducing stress. In most cultures, behaviors with negative healthconsequences carry the \"negative\" label; however, some \"negative\" strategies are quite ef fective and highly reinf orcing in the short term. When adolescents adapt a nd cope by regularly engaging in a specific risk-\u00adbehavior, they experience the short term effectiveness in the context of their lif e. But every clinicia n has seen tragic consequences, including death, when risk behaviors become ingrained coping mechanisms. Stress can become the central driver of somatization. While we often consider \"stress\" an emotion, it is very much a biologic and physical phenomenon. When we experience \"stress\" we are feeling the effects of a drenaline, cortisol, other hormones, and neurological responses. Our hearts beat faster and stronger; we flush and become overheated. Our gut may experience crampy discomfort as blood is shunted to more critical organs and we begin to breathe faster, often leading to light-\u00adheadedness. Most teens are unaware that these scary symptoms are simply their bodies' natura l response to stress. Some teens unconsciously relieve emotional stress through generating a somatic symptom for which they seek medical a ssistance, an effective but ultimately dysfunctional coping strategy. Like most people with \"medically unexplained symptoms\" (D ocCom Module 31), adolescents seldom make the connection between life stresses and body symptoms. Many teens present with somatic complaints such as headache or belly pain for which ca reful evaluation reveals no specific medical problem. Helping them requires that clinicians adopt counseling strategies a nd avoid exacerbating patient and f amily distress (and expense) with additional testing and specialty consultations. Transitio n to counselin g Be explicit with patients about the transition f rom \"examinations\" to sharing information and patient education. B egin with respectful feedback, a cknowledge risk beha vior in life context and seek permission to continue. After gathering data using the SSHADESS mnemonic and completing a physical examination, transition to counseling. The f ollowing is a step-\u00adwise transition technique that begins with feedback that appreciates strengths and capabilities, then recognizes risk behaviors in the larger context of patients' lives, and finally, underscores respect f or patients' autonomy by asking for permission to continue risk behavior discussion. Appreciat e capabilities. \"Julie, I have rea lly enjoyed talking with you. I have learned a lot about you and I apprecia te how honest you have been in talking with me.\" Reco gnize risk behavior -\u00ad in co ntext . \"I admire how much you care about going to colleg e and playing basketball, ...(pause). Also, I a m worried that you are not regularly using condoms when you have sex. Ask permissio n. \"Would you be willing to talk more about this?\" Offering cho ice shows respect a nd also empowers patients to choose whether to address the issue. When the answer is \"yes,\" begin to construct a dialogue that is guiding in nature. Ra rely is the answer \"no,\" but if so, respect this choice, offer to dia logue at any time, ask the patient to ponder the issue and ask for permission to bring it up again at a f uture visit. \"I hear that you don't want to talk about this now and I apprecia te your honesty. I'm here to help you with this, so please think more a bout the issue. I'm always here to listen or answer your questions. Is it OK if I check in with you about this the next time I see you?\"Check o ut the video example a bout transition to the final phase of the visit of addressing risk-\u00adbehavior STRENGTH BASED COUNSELING Our goal a s patient advocates is to empower and strengthen youth - only they can choose to change a behavior. Clinicians too often hinder their counseling eff ectiveness because of a tendency to mistrust youth and expect the worst from them. To change any behavior, a person needs both the conviction that the issue is important and a sense of confidence to make change (Ginsburg, 2002c). If the goal for clinicians who advocate for youth is to empower and strengthen them, then doctors must learn about teens' strengths and capabilities, rather than focus on negative behaviors. Clinicians who listen to youth with their hearts as well a s minds inevitably discover traits or actions to respect and admire, and this is true even when unhealthful or very dangerous behaviors are evident. Emphasizing competence by helping youth discover and acknowledge their strengths is not only the first step to mediating positive change, it is also one of the most inspiring moments in interactions with patients. Not enough teens receive unqualified positive feedba ck from an adult and feel they have someone advoca ting for their needs. Many have never felt \"seen\" or \"heard\" without judgment or reprimand. When teens are guided to acknowledge their strengths, they tend to be more receptive to learning how to use these capabilities to initiate change of worrisome behaviors. Bring your own subconscious expectations and biases into awareness and consciously put them aside in order to avoid hampering your ef fectiveness in essentia l counseling activities. Most adults do not look past the risk-\u00adbeha viors and try to understand why the teen is engaging in dangerous coping strategies. Medical professiona ls see the consequences risky beha viors such a s pregnancy, violence and addiction, every single day. As clinicians, we must ask ourselves, \"Do I define success f or youth in terms of behaviors th ey avoid rather than who they are?\" Carrying low expectations of patients undermines interventions, just as low confidence on patients' part hampers progress. D o not engage in \"blaming the victims\" whose strengths are incessantly undermined by detrimental forces in their environment. If we exclusively target risk and limit our focus to drugs, violence and pregnancy-\u00adprevention programs, we convey low expectations and send adolescents the implicit message that we expect them to engage in these beha viors. Counseling: Connect Stress and Risk Adolescents face stress, derived both from inner anxiety and from difficult interactions with friends or pa rents. Everyone adopts behaviors that help cope with stress, and teens experiment with many strategies, some healthy, others risky. Many dangerous behavior s are effective stress reducers but have long-\u00adterm deleterious consequences. (Note: a separate section on counseling about somatic symptoms follows below)Help adolescents to connect the dots between stressors and harmful behaviors. Helping teen patients view harmful behaviors as typical a nd normal attempts to deal with stress always requires multiple conversa tions. Make use of the previously mentioned communication tools with the goal of exploring motivation and readiness to change. Time is required to cement gains in understanding, to discover motivation f or changing behavior(s) a nd to learn f rom attempts to change. A s patients partner with you in this process, encourage them to assent to your request that multidisciplinary partners such as counselors, social workers a nd psychiatrists join your partnership and lend a id to the process. Approach these conversations in a stepwise f ashion, and consider using the f ollowing structure: (1) elicit the main stressors; (2) ask the teen to explore how the behavior relieves stress; (3) lessen shame by ref raming the behavior in a positive light; (4) explore negative consequences; (5) brainstorm a lternative strategies. 1. Unco ver stressors. Listen f or hints about current or past sources of stress such as bullying, abuse, f amily violence or drug use, and for clues about behaviors the teen uses to adapt to stress. Gently ask a bout stressors or adaptations. \"What are some things that stress you out? What is the main thing going on in your life that is causing you to want to escape?\" Young people tend to be awa re of the stressors they experience, and can name them if asked to do so in a safe environment: \"I get into f ights beca use...\" or \"I smoke marijuana because ...\" or \"When I am stressed out, I...\" This a ffords a more comprehensive picture and additional clues f or guiding the conversation toward constructive paths. 2. Explo re whether and ho w the risk-\u00adbehavio r relieves stress. Some presenting compla ints (such as somatization) and most risk-\u00adbehaviors a re stress-\u00addriven. Explore contextua l details of medically unexplained somatic symptoms, a nd discover as many connections between behaviors and stressors a s possible, as these findings will beuseful when brainstorming alternative methods f or stress reduction. \"Can we look a little more at where and when the headaches come on?\" \"What is it about (behavior) that helps you deal with stress? How does it relieve stress? 3. Lessen the shame -\u00ad reframe: t he teen has fo und a way to cope. Present the hypothesis that the behavior enables the teen to handle some of life's stresses, so that you legitimize the adaptation. This empathic refra ming not only lessens the shame associated w ith disclosure and exploration of a risk-\u00adbehavior but also empowers patients by demonstrating that they are actively making decisions and coping with life. \"Everyone has to explore ways to cope with stress-\u00ad it seems like this (behavior) is working for you, at least at present.... What I am hearing you say is that you have found a way to deal with the stress in your life.... Many people, adults even, don' t ever find wa ys to deal with stress. They just a llow the stress to become overwhelming .... Did you realize that you have f ound at least one way to cope?... What do you think?\" 4. Explo re bot h whet her the risk-\u00adactivity wo rks, and whether there is a negat ive side. Elicit information about how effectively the current behavior serves to relieve stress, and also ask about actual and potential negative consequ ences and drawbacks. Give positive f eedback and ref lect what the teen has disclosed. Assess whether such an exploration helps the patient to gain insight. \"I'd like to help you assess how well (behavior) works to reduce your stress? ...How long does the relief last? ...How do you feel afterward; does it ever make your stress worse? ...Are there other things you don't like about (behavior)? ...I admire that you've thought about all these things. ...It seems that you have f ound a way to relieve a little stress in your life, but from what you are telling me, (behavior) makes you more stressed sometimes. ... What do you think?\" 5. Ask permissio n to brainsto rm alternate suggest ions fo r stress reduct ion (See \"S tress Reduction Ideas,\" below). State your own AND the teen' s concerns, and ask for feedback. Then, guide patients to develop alternate healthy coping strategies that they might use as lifelong stress reduction techniques.\"I' m concerned too about how some of your coping is starting to work against you. ...I worry about the not-\u00adso-\u00ad good ef fects, both today and in the future. ...If you could f ind other ways to help you deal with stress, maybe you wouldn' t feel so bad? ...What do you think? ...Can we try to come up with some other strategies tog ether?\" Connecting the Do ts In this section, we explore a structure that helps you assist adolescents in the process of connecting the dots between their own personal stressors and their adoptions of dangerous / risky behaviors.

They just allow the stress to become overwhelming .... Did you realize that you have found at least one way to cope?... What do you think?\" Explo re bot h whether t he risk-\u00adactivit y wo rks, and whether there is a negative side. Elicit informa tion about how effectively the current behavior serves to relieve stress, and also ask about actual and potential negative consequences and drawbacks. Give positive feedback and ref lect what the teen has disclosed. Assess whether such an exploration helps the patient to gain insight. \"I'd like to help you assess how well (behavior) works to reduce your stress? ...How long does the relief last? ...How do you feel a fterward; does it ever make your stress worse? ...Are there other things you don't like about (behavior)? ...I admire that you've thought about all these things. ...It seems that you have found a way to relieve a little stress in your life, but from what you are telling me, (behavior) makes you more stressed sometimes. ...What do you think?\" Ask permissio n to brainsto rm alt ernate suggest ions for stress reduct ion. State your own AND the teen' s concerns, and ask for feedback. Then, guide patients to develop alternate healthy coping strategies that they might use a s lifelong stress reduction techniques. (See \"S tress Reduction Ideas,\" below) \"I'm concerned too about how some of your coping is starting to work against you. ...I worry about the not-\u00adso-\u00adgood ef fects, both today and in the future. ...If you could f ind other ways to help you deal with stress, maybe you wouldn' t feel so bad? ...What do you think? ...Can we try to come up with some other strategies tog ether?\" Counseling: Advise Facilitate a discussion that avoids lecturing, and help break down large abstract concepts into a series of small concrete steps. Use communication techniques such as the choreographed conversation, role-\u00adplaying, a nd the decision tree to involve the teen in brainstorming diff erent approa ches to stressors. Adolescents are concrete thinkers whose brains have not matured sufficiently to routinely consider the consequences of their actions. Research using f unctional MRI has shown that neuronal connections between the regulatory center of the brain in the prefrontal cortex and the hormonally sensitive, reward-\u00adand impuls e-\u00addriven area the limbic system does not f ully ma ture until the mid-\u00ad20's (Steinberg, 2007). This means that young persons seldom consider consequences when making in-\u00adthe-\u00admoment decisions; in ef fect, they are at the mercy of hormonal drives. Your role in addressing risk-\u00adbehavior is to help teens to examine future consequences of their current actions, to identify their positive capabilities and help them acknowledge their strengths, and then to mobilize these strengths to examine worrisome behaviors and pla n for changing them. When patients assent to discussion, the f undamental goal is to assist these concrete thinkers in anexamination of their a ctions. In general, advice provided in a format that might-\u00ad even remotely-\u00ad be perceived as a lecture, is guaranteed to shut down youths' receptivity to taking action. In terms of \"good\" communication strategies, ask guiding questions, give positive feedback, and reflect back the teens' answers. Include a n opportunity f or teens to examine possible underlying motivations for the behavior - such as stress, a need to \"fit in,\" etc. Even if given in a neutral and non-\u00adcondescendin g tone, a bolus of information in which the clinician connects behavior and consequences puts off the patient. Use the complementa ry strategies described below. A \"choreographed conversation,\" a \"decision tree,\" or a brief \"rehearsal\" can channel the counseling to a n assessment of both the immedia te and longer term consequences of risky behavior. This dialogue breaks down abstract concepts into simple , concrete and understandable steps. Exploring steps in sequence allows patients to discover the key points themselves reach conclusions on their own. The process leads teens to an abstract realization of why the risk behavior is harmful, what we call a \"Cognitive Ah-\u00adHa! Moment\"(Ginsburg, 2001). See sections below for more detail a bout implementing these strategies. The Choreographed Co nversatio n The c horeographed conversation is a planned and loosely f ormatted dialogue that begins with questions to help teens explore the problem from different a ngles. The clinician conveys severa l points to the patient, a nd helps brainstorm other points by asking guiding questions and by reflecting back the teen' s answers. Include empowering feedback with the reflections to assist patients to discern key concepts and to develop a sense of self-\u00adef ficacy. The following sample questions could be used to guide a young woman to a conscious connection between using condoms and the STDs she is worried about. A simila r set of questions could help her consider the consequences of getting pregnant and how that would a ffect her dreams of going to college and playing basketball. Some sample \"choreographed\" questions / reflections, with empowering f eedback include: \"Julie, what are co ndoms fo anyway? What do t hey do ?\" \"I apprecia te your ability to talk about this - it is often a difficult subject. What do you mean infections? Which ones are you worried about?\" \"You know a lot about these things. Doctors worry about these infections, too. Tell me more about why YOU worry about infections.\" \"Yes, Chlamydia and Gonorrhe a can hurt a lot, especially if they go up into your fallopian tubes and ovaries. And just like you said, people die from HIV and there still is no cure. There a re also some diseases that we don't have good tests for that a person may not know they have, like herpes.\" \"And those are all good reasons to use condoms.\" \"So how come yo u are not using co ndoms every time you have sex?\" The Decisio n Tree Another technique is the decision tree, essentially a choreographed conversation written out on paper. Ask guiding questions to discover alternate, often unintended outcomes and use a writing surface to illustra te the process and help adolescents to visualize these potential outcomes. The product is a diagram that represents a series of choices leading to the outcomes. An additional bonus of the decision tree is that patients can take home the diagram to contemplate further. This decision tree (Figure) was used with a 14-\u00adyear-\u00adold girl, who presented with a sclera l hemorrhage in a school-\u00adbased clinic. She became mad enough to fight when a girl insulted her mother. When a sked what was going to happen next, she responded \"I'm g oing to kill her, that' s why I brought this knife (which she had in her pocket) to school.\" When a sked how that would make her feel, she responded, \"Good!\" When asked ho w long she would f eel good she responded \"All day!\" She needed a tool that would help her contemplate an important future consequence, namely, how her actions would affect her mother, since she f ought to protect her mother's honor. Her clinician asked questions that helped her brainstorm diff erent scenarios and outcomes, examine and weigh the consequences and develop the decision tree shown in the figu re. REHEARSAL Another counseling technique is rehea rsal (DocCom Module 10). Most people need to practice verbalizing realizations gained during a conversa tion or brainstorming session. To introduce this technique, use terms like \"practice\" or \"rehearse\" instea d of \"role play,\" a concept that would generally bring to mind \"on stage\" or \"perf orming\" and potentially make teens f eel uncomfortable. However, remain in professional role, do not use teen langua ge (current or past slang) a nd describe concepts in a simple, concrete f ashion. Provide positive feedback for the answers she gives, and add information and phrasing that may be helpful to integrate into her mock dialogue. Some ways to spea k about rehearsal might include: \"You've shown me that you can think pretty clearly about this. Let' s practice what you will sa y to your boyfriend if he does not want to use condoms.......\" \"The way you said that seems convincing to me. What if he then says, 'Why do you want to use condoms, don't you trust me?' Can we rehearse to gether what you might say?\" \"That's g reat, and I know you have coped well with some other complex situa tions before this. Now, what if he says, 'I' ve been checked for every disease; I don't have anything.' What wo uld yo u say?\" CONNECT STRESS AND SOMATIC SYMPTOMS The stress reaction a lerts people to presence of danger. This adaptive biologic reaction can and does produce physical symptoms that sometimes reach the level of somatization - the teen is disabled by somatic symptoms. Facilitate healing both by attentive listening to symptoms and perspectives a nd by describing links between stress a nd physical symptoms. Build trusting relationships over time by repeated listening and examining, while minimizing testing. For patients who are experiencing soma tization, that is, disabling somatic symptoms, your goal is to facilitate healing by helping them understand that body and mind are integrated. The following discrete steps all contribute expanding patients' understanding: 1. obtain a thorough a nd comprehensive history; 2. elicit the patient's illness perspective; 3. perform a thorough physical exam; 4. be transparent in your f indings and assessment; 5. discuss your differential diagnosis, and include the possibility that the symptom is stress related; 6. clarify the mechanisms that translate psychic and environmenta l stresses into soma tic symptoms; 7. reduce shame associated with somatiza tion by validating and norma lizing symptoms; 8. make a diagnostic a nd treatment plan and ask the patient f or buy-\u00adin. Somatiztion: Explo ratio n Engage the patient by eliciting all aspects of the symptoms, eliciting their perspectives, and being transparent about the exam and findings. 1. Obtain a tho rough and co mprehensive medical histo ry. Utilize a ctive listening skills to demonstrate engagement with the patient's story and suff ering. When patients suf fering from soma tic compla ints feel engagement and accurate reflections of their distress, they become less a nxious and mistrusting. Listen to the whole story as long as it takes, until the patient is done. Ask questions about a ssociated symptoms and timing of the presenting compla int. Elicit the SSHA DESS screen, and past and present stresses. Retell the storyincluding the new information, and elicit feedback from the patient about your understanding. 2. Elicit the patient's illness perspective. Ask the teen and parent to provide their perspective on the symptom. A helpful patient-\u00adcentered technique that elicits the patient's illness perspective is called FIFE (Rosenberg, 1997). FIFE is a mnemonic tha t stands for Feelings/Fears (What are you most af raid is going on?), Ideas/Instincts (What do you think is going on? What is your instinct about what is g oing on?), Function (How has this af fected what you can do and want to do?) a nd Expectations (What are your expectations from today's visit and what can I help you with most right now?). 3. Perfo rm a tho rough physical exam. As the exam is done, address specifically and with transparency the patients' central f ears and instincts. Link this strategy with the FIFE technique because it provides a n opportunity to reassure patients that is pertinent to their central concern, such as headaches, dizziness or belly pain. 4. Be transparent abo ut findings. As the exam is done, give voice to your thinking, as this level of transparency rea ssures patients not only about your concern for their suff ering, but also about your thoroughness and the lack of suspicious f indings. Somatiztion: Initial Management Somatization is mysterious and embarrassing. Management of the adolescent with disabling somatic symptoms begins with introducing the possibility of a stress-\u00adrelated condition, discussing how stress might produce the disorder, normalizing the stress response a nd finding common ground about a treatment plan. 1. Discuss the assessment and differential diagno sis, and include the possibility of a stress-\u00adrelated diagno sis. Of course, keep an open mind about symptoms so that diseases other than somatization a re not ignored or missed. In discussion, state the possibility that the symptom(s) could be stress related and tha t this is a common a daptation to stress. Negative test results will then conf irm this possibility at a subsequent visit. Waiting until another visit to even mention possible stress adaptation often leads patients to think doctors are defaulting to \"it's all in your head\" because they did not order the right test to find the \"right\" diagnosis. 2. Discuss the mechanism. Take time to expla in the biology. Guide patients pa st their natural and expected skepticism by saying that stress - from emotions or other sources-\u00ad produces hormones like adrenaline a nd cortisol and leads to intense, diverse and sometimes devastating eff ects over time. First ask, \"How old a re you?\" \"Most people your age are not able to answer this question yet. It is somet hing most people don' t figure out until they a re much older.\" \"But, have you noticed that you are more likely to have (symptom) if you are having a strong emotion, like being stressed, angry, or sad?\" \"Before you answer, let me tell you what I am asking. I absolutely know you are having (symptom); I am not a sking if you are faking or crazy. You see the mind and the body are connected in ways we barely u ndersta nd. And, everyone is a little dif ferent.\"3. Reduce shame. Recognize the inherent shame people carry a bout somatization. Minimize shame by repeating tha t the symptom is a common, norma l and predictable (but dysfunctional) result of the body's response to stress. If parents are present, ask them what happens in their bodies when they are stressed. Clinicians might even discuss their own body's stress reaction, and underscore body complexity that makes people experience stress differently one f rom another. When patients continu e to reject the expla nation, assuming clinicians believe that they are \"f aking\" or \"crazy,\" explicitly deny this notion. Provide anecdotes about successf ul symptom remission in prior patients. \"For me, I get nausea with immediate stress, headaches with a couple of hours of stress, and I can' t sleep if stress lasts for more tha n a day. \" Turning to parent, \"What does your body do when you are stressed ?\" Demonstrating a caring attitude towards the pa rent allows the teen to witness a therapeutic interaction about stress-\u00adrelated symptoms. 4. Make a plan and ask fo r buy in. If testing is warranted, tell the patient what tests you are planning on ordering. If you know that the patient/parent expects a certa in test ordered (from the FIFE technique), address this now, supporting whether tests a re warranted by physical exam and overall assessment. Minimize testing, but state tha t certainty is elusive in medical practice, so careful follo w up is essential and routine. Declare openness to future testing as indicated by developments. D iscuss test risks, such as those f rom radiation with XRAYS a nd CT scans to help patients and pa rents realize that there are inherent drawbacks to testing, and tha t delaying certain tests is a wise strategy. \"Have you noticed the body-\u00admind connection in you yet?\" If YES: \"Great, that' s very helpful. But it's my job to worry and to make sure I don't miss the big thing s. So I a m going to do a thorough exam and mig ht even do some tests. Will you agree tha t if I decide that this may be stress related, we can come up with a plan to deal with that?\" If NO: \"Ok, either wa y, I am g oing to do a thoroug h exam and may even do some tests. Then, if I don't have an a nswer yet, I a m going to send you home with a diary. Every time that you have a -\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad, I want you to answer all of those questions I asked today, about f ood, location etc, including its timing compared to stress. Ok? Will you agree tha t if I decide this ma y be stress related, we can work together to come up with a plan to deal with that?\" Check o ut the video example of beginning to counsel a patient who is suf fering severe somatic symptoms. Somatizatio n: compla ints often resolve af ter a thorough history and careful exam tha t includestrust building empathic statements and some exploration of belief systems. Adding an explora tion of alternative coping strategies provides additional help when working with ma jor disabling symptoms. At later visits, a s patients begin to accept that physical symptoms are stress-\u00adrelated, explore alternate coping strategies that include physical, spiritual, and creative outlets that ca n expand patients' repertoire for handling stress. Use the Stress Reduction plan outlined in the next section, and reassure the family tha t you will continue to address their concerns. Remain a lert to the possibility of other underlying causes, continue to review the history and physical, and proceed cautiously with procedures that have their own risks and tend to divert attention f rom the primary mind-\u00adbody issues. The steps outlined for somatization management are specif ically tailored for disabling unexplained symptoms. However, experienced practitioners confronting any new symptom elicit patients' concerns and belief s up f ront, and many integrate the FIFE inquiries into such encounters. Using the tools discussed, they expand the conversation and build trust. Furthermore, every symptom has some emotional component, whose size and impact remain hidden until explored in conversation. This explora tion provides information about patients' belief s, and is simultaneously also therapeutic (D ocCom Module 3.) IDEAS FOR STRESS REDUCTION These are suggestions f or teens on dealing with stress. You should review the topics with the teen during the visit, but can a lso give the teen a handout to take home. 1. Exercise Listen to your body: when you are stressed, your body is saying RUN and you need to get rid of the stress hormones! !!! When you use up those hormones, you will concentrate/think better. Exercise every day to control stress and to build a strong, healthy body. 2. Fool your bo dy into thinking t hat you are relaxed Breathe deeply and slowly. Put your body in a relaxed position-\u00ad tell your body there is no emergency! Visualize yourself in a calm, beautif ul place. Close your eyes and go there for 1 minute. Recline and ta ke deep breaths while you are there. 3. Let it out!! Deal with the Emot ions: Do n't ho ld all o f your feelings inside. Find someone (who deserves your trust) to share your f eelings with and get advice from them. Many teena gers benefit from an extra adult relationship with a teacher, counselor, or medical provider. Be creative! ! Things like music, poetry, writing, singing, dance, or rapping are ALL powerful ways to let your f eelings out. Deal with only one problem at a time. 1. Sometimes f eelings become so overwhelming that we put them away in a box, thinking we will deal with them later. 2. Once there is too much in the box it becomes terrifying to open - and we don't deal with anything. 3. The box can overflow, especially when we are angry or frustrated 4. Pick just one problem to deal with and forget all the rest. 5. Find a calm, quiet place, brea the deeply, and think, talk, or write about only one problem at a time. 4. Take t ime for yo urself Everyone deserves some private time, something special every day. Time to think, to relax, and to do something that makes you happy: medita te, pray,take a bath, take a walk, and be creative! 5. Get it done...then play! Putting things of f creates more stress because you are worrying about the work you still have to do. Make a plan: Have fun exercising and burn off those stress hormones; then get your work done; then enjoy the rest of the night without worry! 6. Lastly: Sleep 8 hours regularly, eat healthfully, and brainsto rm your own ideas for stress reduct ion!!!! CONCLUSION Helping youth discern wha t stress-\u00adrelieving strategies work best f or them is seldom achieved in one visit; neither is guiding teens completely a way from risk-\u00adbehavior. While we ra rely witness an overnight transformation, we can help adolescents recognize and build on their existing com petencies. We can help them not only to link risk-\u00adbehavior with stress but also to learn the skills to initiate alternate strategies so as to lessen their reliance on unhealthy and da ngerous solutions. Join with adolescent patients and their parents to develop trusting and non-\u00adjudgmental rela tionships. Express your a ppreciation of their dilemmas and your respect f or their successes, and use a strength-\u00ad based approach to addressing risk-\u00adbehaviors. Learn ef fective skills f or exploring linkages between stress, behavior and symptoms, and f or brainstorming new options a nd making new choices tha t build upon patients' existing strengths and fa cilitate additional successes in their lives. RELEVANT BEHAVIORS 1. Consistently project a n open, non-\u00adjudgmental attitude and demeanor throughout the entire encounter. 2. \"Set the stage\" with each new patient and briefly with returning patients. This includes explaining why private information (medical and personal) will be asked of the teen and what will be done with the information (i.e. confidentiality). 3. Discuss confidentiality with each a dolescent pa tient using concrete words that the teen will understand. 4. Involve parents as much as possible, but a lways focus primarily on the teen as the center of the interview. The provider should plan to spend time a lone with each a dolescent patient. 5. Attempt to elicit the SS HADESS screen in a free-\u00adflowing dialogue that is focused on eliciting the teen' s strengths as well as risk behaviors. SSHADESS: Strengths, School, Home, Activities, Drugs, Emotions (depression/suicidality), Sexuality and Saf ety 6. Maximize safe a nd honest communication with the teen by eliciting the entire SSHADESS screen first before addressing a ny risk beha vior. This approach projects the attitude that the provider is interesting in learning about the entire life and situation of the teen, not just about what the teen is \"doing wrong.\" 7. Try to be aware of personal reactions, biases, a nd expectations. This will help the provider remain non-\u00adjudgmental as s/he listens to the teen. 8. Approach behaviora l change with patients using a streng th-\u00adbased tactic. This means focusing first on what teens are \"doing right\", then helping them f ind solutions to their current problems. 9. Avoid lecturing. Instead, when a ddressing risk-\u00adbehavior, the provider should get teens involved in brainstorming their own solutions by using techniques such as the choreographed conversation, role-\u00adplaying, and the decision-\u00adtree. 10. Ask every teen about their current stressors at each encounter. This a pproach will help minimize the stigma of stress and will also help the provider with current or future interventions that may involve somatization or stress-\u00adreduction.

INTRODUCTION Older patients are a large and growing portion of the practice of every clinician who cares f or adults. Communicating with older patients, many of whom have multiple complex, interacting problems can be daunting, especially when time is limited. In this module, we review techniques for communicating effectively with older patients, especially those with sensory, cognitive, a nd functional impa irments, and for interacting with their caregivers. These skills and strategies assist clinicia ns in making more comprehensive dia gnoses as well as effective and informed joint decisions with patients and their caregivers during rela tively brief encounters. We also provide a n opportunity f or learners to examine their own assumptions, values, and beliefs related to aging that may influence medical decision-\u00admaking. We show how ageism, comprised of negative attitudes about the elderly, ca n influence care. Ageism in Health Care Learners' exposure to frail older adults who communicate poorly can result in negative stereotyping; this is a geism. When a geism is unexamined, it impairs trust and communication with both patients and colleagues, anddiminishes the quality of care provided to elderly patients. Medical training exposes students and residents to a disproportionately ill popula tion of older adults. Learners in the health professions interact less frequently with healthy older adults, who f ar outnumber those who are chronically ill or frail. Hospitals and chronic care f acilities are filled withelderly persons who have complex problems that are difficult to diagnose and treat, and who frequently communicate slowly or poorly. Extensive a nd repetitive exposure to the sickest of older adults often results in negative stereotyping of the entire geriatric population by medical learners (1). Learning to provide high quality care to this popula tion requires that students recognize and reflect on this bias, as everyone must do with other importa nt stereotypes to which everyone is subject, such as racism or sexism. Ageism, like other biases, f requently operates at a subconscious level but nevertheless ca n strongly inf luence the way we view older patients, provoking negative a ttitudes toward ca ring f or them, inaccurate assumptions rega rding their functionality and preferences for care, and erroneously poor estimates of their prognoses. This bias ca n also adversely affect interactions wit h patients, impairing communication, trust and other importa nt aspects of the doctor-\u00adpatient relationship. A wareness of the ef fects of medical education on promoting nega tive attitudes, introspection into feelings about older adults, and interaction with healthy elderly can serve to minimize ageism. (2) Ageism can also insidiously af fect how medical colleagues interact with one another. Negative comment s regarding both elderly patients and clinicia ns headed for careers in geriatrics abound in medical education settings, perpetuated by students, residents, and attending clinicians. These attitudes a re typically f ostered outside of formal educationa l settings and thus constitute a n \"informal curriculum\" that promotes ageism. Upholding standards of medical professionalism requires that you do your part in creating a work environment that is respectful of patients a nd coworkers, through actions such as using respectful language when speaking of older adult patients, initiating conversation with a colleague who behaves or speaks inappropriately, and raising awareness of professionalism in the work place. Later in this module, severa l videos illustra te how attitudes can a ffect care of the elderly. Give Yourself t he Time Needed for Elderly Patient s Develop and use strategies that will prevent frustrations a bout time and the resulting impairment of trust. You will be f rustrated if you enter a geriatric interview with the same temporal expectations you would have f or interviewing a younger patient, and your f rustra tion will likely result in behaviors that impair establishment of trust. It takes more time to interview older patients. Simply f rom having lived longer, they have more history to report, and their medical problems are often more numerous. Typical conditions of older adults, such as Parkinson's disease, strokes, or dementia, retard response times to your queries. Time constraints ca n be mitigated by: altering your schedule to allot more time with older patients asking your patient or caregiver to fill out a questionnaire before the visit. This questionnaire can include H&P questions, as well as questions about concerns, need for medication renewals, etc. setting an agenda and prioritizing topics at the outset of the interview, perhaps saying, \"What a re the three main problems you would like to address today? (See Modules 5 and 7.) dividing the interview into more than one session Before st arting the Interview Review the patient's record, arrange the environment, check f or comfort, vision and hearing, and decide whether to include a partner or caregiver. Prior to interviewing elderly patients, especially those with complex problems, review the record, even if only to refresh yourself about the patient's problems and medications. After arranging the physical environment for optimal communication, check the patient's comfort level and suitability for effective communication. Finally, before beginning the actual interview, make an explicit decision a bout whether or not a caregiver or spouse should be present, and ma ke it so. While caregivers can of ten provide important inf ormation, the patient's wishes regarding their presence and input must be solicited and respected. Probably the simplest way to establish this is to ask the patient, Can you see and hear me OK? Are you comfortable? Would you prefer that (your caregiver) leave the room, or join us? Communicate with Caregivers Caregivers provide essential support for many older patients and are part of the care giving team. Communicate and collaborate with your patients' ca regivers while maintaining patient autonomy and confidentiality. For older patients who receive ongoing care from paid or unpaid caregivers, the therapeutic relationship is no longer a dyad, but a tria d. Caregivers are usually a family member, often a daughter or daughter-\u00adin-\u00adlaw, who accompanies the patient to visits and communicates with the clinician or other clinical staff between visits. Remain patient-\u00adcentered, negotiate confidentiality issues and be alert to pa tient-\u00adcaregiver relationship problems. Begin with t he Patient In private, elicit patients' pre ferences about your communications with caregivers, seek permission to share informa tion with ca regivers, and ask a bout sensitive topics such as relationship with the caregiver and sexual activity. Spend time alone with the patient, at the beginning of your relationship a nd periodically thereafter. This usually means asking the caregiver to leave the room for a portion of the visit. Use simple, direc t language. \"It's important that I spend time alone with each of my patients. Would you mind stepping out for just a few minutes? Just wait in the (hallway, lobby)-\u00ad-\u00ad I'll come get you.\" If caregivers raise concerns a bout leaving the room, these expressions are usually important \"openers\" to learn more about unspoken concerns, anxieties, stress, or tension between the patient and caregiver. Check with the pa tient about how they want you to communicate with caregiver(s) about their health, and specif ically ask their permission to share informa tion with ca regivers. Establish confidentiality rules, even with patients with mild-\u00adto-\u00admoderate dementia. Emphasize that you cankeep conf idential any specific issues that might arise in the future. During your time alone with patients: ASK, \"Is there something you would like to discuss while we have this privacy?\" COMPA RE patients' presence with and without the caregiver. Does the patient' s affect or nonverbal behavior change? Does the patient appear more or less agita ted or anxious without the caregiver present? Observed differences may be clues to the relationship between patient and caregiver. B e alert to the possibility that they amount to warnings of a buse or neglect. ASK about sensitive areas, especially the caregiver and sexual concerns. About relationship with the caregiver, you might ask: \"What do you and (the caregiver) disagree most about?\" or \"Do you feel nervous or afraid with (the careg iver)?\" About sexual concerns, you might ask: \"Do you have any concerns or questions about sex or sexua l activity?\" Keep Patient at the Center Greet the patient first and begin each interview by conversing directly with the pa tient - even if demented or verbally impaired-\u00ad-\u00ad so that you can better assess the patient and also model effective communication strategies f or the caregiver. For patients with impaired communication, you might explain your wish to begin with the patient by saying, \"I'd like to a ssure you that the accuracy of the patient's report is not as important as my having this direct communica tion,\" and \"I'll surely g ive you a chance to fill in the story from your caregiver's perspective.\" As with any important conversation where time is a n issue, you and the caregiver will likely need to negotia te and reach agreement on who talks when.An open, direct, wa rm approa ch in a sking the caregiver to hold their comments is nearly always effective in achieving a therapeutic alliance with the caregiver. Inform ation f rom this negotia tion process may help guide your patient interview a s well as shed light on positive and nega tive aspects of the patient-\u00adcaregiver relationship. Include the Caregiver as a Member o f the Healthcare Team After patients give permission to share information with the caregiver, use the three-\u00adway conversation to assess the caregiver, coach the patient and caregiver about day-\u00adto-\u00adday mana gement issues, a nd clarify priorities and values most important for the patient. Assess caregiver stress through direct inquiry, either with the patient present if rapport is strong and the patient and caregiver have demonstrated effective, open communication, or in a private conversation. If separate f rom the patient, you might briefly explain the purpose of the conversation by saying, \"I'd like to see how (the caregiver) is doing, in a private conversation.\"The stress of caring f or an impaired parent or other relative surprisingly often provokes abuse or neglect by people who are otherwise quite competent and stable, particularly if impairment is from dementia. \"Prescribe\" time away f rom the patient to a lleviate guilt and decrease caregiver stress. Say something like, \"Experience shows that the kind of attention required f rom you on behalf of the patient is very stressf ul. I always prescribe \"time off\" for caregivers. How are you doing?\" Provide caregivers with information and coaching on use of resources such as books (3), support groups, counseling services, and social workers who can a dvise them on local options for living arrangements and in-\u00adhome support. PHYSIC AL, SENSORY AND COGNITIVE DEFICITS With very simple measures, unfortunately often overlooked by busy clinicia ns, you ca n overcome communication barriers that derive from patients' sensory, physica l, or cognitive impairments. Many older adults have chronic conditions causing sensory, physica l, and cognitive def icits that ca n impair communication with medical providers. When interviewing younger patient s, we often safely assume that such deficits are not present. To facilitate effective communication with the older adult, however, you must check for such deficits and compensa te for any that are present. B efore getting started with the interview, you can f irst optimize the physica l environment to facilitate communication via the measures described below. Senso ry Impairment s Patients cannot communic ate well unless they can hea r you and see you. Both conductive and sensorineural loss hearing deficits increase exponentially with age. Optimize patients' hearing with the f ollowing measures: Clear the ear canal of cerumen. Conduct the interview in a quiet room. Ensure proper placement and functioning of hearing a ids. Face the patient and avoiding glare (see above) to aid lip-\u00adrea ding. Use proper vocal pacing a nd pitch. Click on the picture-\u00adbutton on the left to play a video in which Dr. Willia ms communica tes with a hearing impaired patient.Visual impairments increase exponentially with age, a nd stem f rom three main causes: refractive error, cataracts, and macular degenera tion. To ensure optimal visual functioning, take the following a ctions before commencing with the interview: Make sure that patients have their gla sses on. Minimize glare, which is particularly troublesome for those with catara cts. Avoid back lighting, by not positioning yourself in front of a window or other light source. Ideally, the room should be illuminated with indirect lighting. Maximize acuity. For patients with severe visual impairment, sit closer a nd use nametags printed with a large f ont. Click on the picture-\u00adbutton on the left to play a video in which Dr. Willia ms communica tes with a visually impaired patient. Physical Deficit s Ask about physical comfort a nd take mea sures to assure it. Older adults with conditions impairing posture or mobility pose other obstacles to effective interviewing. To eliminate the potential perception of a power dif ferential between you and your patient and to facilitate communication, position yourself level with the pa tient's eyes. This may mean sitting or kneeling next to a patient in a wheelchair, and even sitting on the floor to look directly at a patient with a pronounced thoracic kyphosis. Older patients ma y have numerous conditions that render it painful to sit or lie in certa in positions. As with all interviews, patient comfort must be ma ximize d, and assuring comf ort wa rrants a simple inquiry into a patient's comfort bef ore beginning the rest of the interview. Cognitive Deficits Detecting and compensa ting for cognitive deficits is a complex and nuanced endeavor. In order to discern cognitive dysfunction, you will remain alert f or clues that arise during your interview. Conf irm deficits with formal mental status testing, and solicit inform ation f rom caregivers. Minimizing sensory a nd physical obstacles to interviewing is relatively stra ightforward through direct inquiry and manipulation of the physical surroundings. Many cognitively impaired patients lack insight into their deficits, and those aware of impaired cognition may be defensive or embarrassed. You will usually discern impaired functioning by observing clues that surf ace throu gh the course of the interview, rather than asking pa tients directly about cognitive status. The clues you may notice include the following signs of cognitive impairment:Evasive or defensive responses to innocuous questions (\"Oh, I don't work anymore so I don't need know wha t day it is.\") Lack of specif icity regarding recall of recent events Excessive use of \"pat,\" or simplistic responses Reliance on a caregiver or spouse to provide a nswers to queries Difficulty with word f inding Keep in mind that social behaviors are retained in early dementia, so you can be easily fooled into thinking that a well-\u00addressed, socially appropriate demented patient is cognitively intact. If you suspect the presence of cognitive impairment, you must confirm it through f ormal mental status testing during the physica l examination portion of the patient visit. Before that, however, you can pose certain other questions during the interview to gather more information, such as the following: \"How do your days go -\u00ad what do you do in a typical day, lately?\" A lack of specif icity in the patient's description heightens suspicion of a cognitive problem. \"What have you heard about recent important news, in the world or locally?\" \"Would you fill me in on some recent medical events in your life?\" When you are having difficulty obtaining information f rom a patient that you suspect has cognitive impairment, soliciting f urther information f rom a caregiver or spouse (with the patient's consent) is often very helpful (see \"Communica ting with Cognitively Impaired Patients\" section in this module). GATHERING DATA In this \"Gathering D ata\" segment, we discuss how older patients' symptom descriptions differ from typical descriptions, with emphasis on va gue and downplayed symptoms. We note that attention to structured routines-\u00ad for example, about past history and review of systems-\u00ad is of specia l importance in establishing diagnosis and making treatment pla ns with the elderly. This chapter is divided into two sub-\u00adchapters: Sympt oms Often, very signif icant or serious diseases in older patients do not present themselves as well-\u00addescribed symptoms or appear to you as typical syndromes. Explore symptoms carefully, despite their vague character or patients' downplaying of them. Routines Certain elements of \"routine\" data gathering tend to have more importance in the management of your elderly patients. Attend to details about patients' psychosocial context, past history, medications and review of systems. Gathering Dat a: Sympt oms Often, very signif icant or serious diseases in older patients do not present themselves as well-\u00ad described symptoms or appear to you as typical syndromes. E xplore symptoms carefully, despite their vague chara cter or patients' downplaying of them. Downplaying meaning of symptoms. Research shows that older adults tend to downplay or underreport symptoms. (4,5) B e aware that comments downplayed symptoms a re cues topursue the compla int further, because patients often ascribe a bnormal symptoms to a norma l aging process. Typical comments sound like: \"It's nothing really\" or \"It's just a ge, I guess\" Vague complaints. The sensitivity and specificity of symptoms f or predicting specific conditions decrease with age. \"Classic\" presenta tions a re less common and atypical presenta more f requent. A complaint of \"a little indigestion\" could simply indicate dyspepsia - but it f requently indicates angina or intestinal ischemia. Ca refully and methodically exploring va gue complaints a nd discovering their cause is a challenge. Geriatric syndromes. Frail older adults with many illnesses often experience \"geriatric syndromes.\" This term refers to the common symptomatic endpoints of the interplay of multiple medical conditions and psychosocial stressors. Common syndromes include confusion, incontinence, frequent fa lls, immobility, nonspecific functional decline, and weight loss. These syndromes seldom arise from a single cause when they appea r in frail elderly patients. Employ an interdisciplinary, team approach to establish the proper dia gnosis and management plans (see next section). Gathering Dat a: Rout ines Certain elements of \"routine\" data gathering tend to have more importance in the management of your elderly patients.(6) Attend to details about patients' psychosocial context, past history, medications and review of systems. Past history. When a ssuming the care of older patients, conduct a comprehensive review of their past history. Reviews are often tedious and time-\u00adconsuming, but essential for gaining a sense of the medical trajectory of the patient's life. Careful reviews also minimize duplication of testing and of expensive consultations that may be enervating f or patients. Medication review. About one-\u00adquarter of older adults take 5 or more prescription drugs. Adverse drug reactions are a common cause of symptoms a nd severe illness in the elderly. Few people who require multiple medications can recite the details succinctly, particularly when time is short, a nd we suggest using the \"brown bag\" method f or medication review. Instruct the patient or caregiver to put all med icines and supplements into a bag and bring them to the visit. A trained medical assistant or nurse can then review the medications, compare them to the medication record, and report the results to you. Psychosocial context. A patient's living situation, family (and other) conflicts and supports, availability of caregivers, and ability to perform activities of daily living a nd instrumental activities such as driving or shopping shape all medical diagnostic a nd management decisions. Establish the patient's f unctional status with a thorough exploration of psychosocial fa ctors. Ask about sensitive topics such as sexual activity and about relationships with caregivers. Screen for abuse or neglect. Family history. When pressed for time, the family history is one area of the geriatric interview that can be abbreviated. You take a family history to discern fa milial patterns of premature disease in order to screen or monitor such conditions. By definition, however, the elderly do not have premature disea se. Review of systems. As a group, older adults usually have more medical conditions a nd more positives in the review of systems tha n younger patients. Minimize the problems that result from underreporting of symptoms by performing a diligent review of systems and working through any positives.Understanding Patients' Functio nal Status and Preferences fo r Care Decision-\u00admaking with older patients is complex and nuanced, and frequently requires that you balance complicated medical conditions, patient values, a nd prognostic considerations. Establishing trust is an important goal of a ny patient interview, and holds true with older patients. Genera l methods for fostering trust are considered in detail in Modules 5 and 6. Attend particula rly to using open-\u00adended questions at the beginning and to responding to both verbally and non-\u00ad verbally expressed Geriatrics is a functionally-\u00adbased discipline, and wa rrants respectful inquiry about a patient' s living situation, functional status, outlook on life, and preferences for care. S ome open ended questions that help to establish this information migh t include: Living sit uation: \"Tell me about where you are living.\" \"Who a t home?\" Funct ional stat us: \"How are you able to g et along throug h the course of a typical day?\" \"Could you describe a day f or me?\" Outlo ok on life: \"What is the best thing about your life right now?\" -\u00ad \"What is the worst thing?\" \"On a scale f rom 0 to 100, where 100 is the best life you can imagine, and 0 is being dea d, or worse if there is such a thing for you, what is your number?\" Preferences fo r care: \"Have you thought about wha t you would like to happen if you became very sick? Perhaps you have already prepared a living will.\" \"Could you share with me some of your thoughts about these matters?\" See Modules 32 a nd 34 for interview strategies that assist with discussing and establishing care preferences. Clarify Values and Care Preferences Making good medical decisions depend s on ef fectively helping pa tients and caregivers clarif y their values and share their thinking with you. Effective medical decision-\u00adma king is a mutual process between doctor, patient and caregiver, and clinicians who assure that it is an open process within which each party shares thoughts a nd values about what is important and what should be done strengthens trust among the pa rties. Module 32 stress es that values discussions provide better guidance than asking about specif ic interventions such as chemotherapy, ventila tors, f eeding tubes or resuscitation. Modules 9-\u00ad11 cover details about the complex process of f inding the right decisions. Ask direct open-\u00adended questions to elicit values, such as, \"What do you seek from your medical care?\" Also, review hypothetica l scenarios to enhance mutual understanding. This might sound like,\"If you beca me really ill, would you prefer to minimize medical intervention to be as comfortable a s possible, and die in 6 months, or would you prefer to go through uncomfortable treatments so tha t you might live a f ew months longer?\" CHALLENGES: COMPLEX COMMUNICATIONS In this \"challenges\" segment, we discuss how cognitively impaired patients' need for autonomy affects clinician decisions about communications. In addition, collaborative conversations with caregivers must support patie nts' independence while maintaining confidentiality. Clinicians must balance patients' interest in autonomy and independence against considerations of patients' safety. This chapter is divided into two sub-\u00adchapters: Cognit ive impairments and co mmunicat of medical decision-\u00admaking as well-\u00ad intentioned clinicia ns and caregivers pla n for their safety. Optimize the balance (and resolve any conflicts) between your patients' independence in decision-\u00admaking on the one hand, and their saf ety on the other. Caregivers and communicat ion Caregivers provide essential support for many older patients and are part of the care giving team. Communicate and collaborate with your patients' ca regivers while maintaining patient autonomy and confidentiality. Strategies fo r communicating with co gnitively impaired patient s Too often cognitively impa ired patients \"left out\" well-\u00ad intentioned clinicia ns and caregiver s plan f or their sa fety. Optimize the balance (a nd resolve any conflicts) between your patients' independence in decision-\u00admaking on the one hand, and their saf ety on the other. Medical decision-\u00admaking is context-\u00adspecif ic. Patients not capable of making decisions in some areas (e.g., saf e driving) can possess decision-\u00adma king capacity in others (e.g., timing or dose of medications). Patients who understa nd the options and consequences for a particular medical decision possess decision-\u00admaking capacity in that context, even in the presence of underlying cognitive impairment. Assess cognitively impaired patients for decision-\u00admaking capacity, and involve them in decision-\u00admaking whenever possible. When patients ca nnot make medical decisions or provide informed consent to them, make decisions with the careg iver in the presence of the pa tient. Then, periodically \"check in\" to gauge patients' understanding and reaction to the options or recommendations under discussion. When patients have severe cognitive impairment and are unable to report symptoms such as pain or depression, observe their beha vior and work with and coach ca regivers in detecting distress. Some typical signs of distress a re sleep disorder , agitation and tense facial expressions. (7) Driving Mo tor Vehicles Driving carries tremendous symbolic importance about autonomy, and any conversa tion about driving threatens and f rightens cognitively impaired patients. Periodically review driving history with cognitively impaired patients and at least one observer. Initiate conversation about driving with the pa tient, and then include the caregiver. Taking the driving privilege awa y is fraught with distress, so a ct only on clearly observed a nd reported f acts about deficits. If necessary, arrange for obtaining data from reliable observers. Guidelines on when to restrict driving in patients with dementia are available for both clinicia ns (8) and fa milies. (9) States do not agree on uniform criteria for restricting driving. B ecome f amiliar with laws and regulations in your state regarding required testing and find o ut who can call for manda tory testing against the patient's wishes (clinicians, fa mily). AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) COMMUNICATING WITH HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS Providing good care for older patients requires that multiple health care providers, usually including at least a clinician, nurse, and socia l worker, perform as a team, developing the ability to openly express opinions, feelings and conflicts, and agree on processes for resolving disagreements. Quality care of older patients requires effective interdisciplinary teamwork. Conflicts may arise because team members on the one hand expect leadership from any clinicians involved, while on the other hand they value a flattening of hiera rchy, and wa nt clinicians to a cknowledge the special expertise of team members. Many team membe rs have little opportunity to practice skills that would help with negotia ting such conflicts. Show that you respect the autonomy, the feelings a nd the ideas of other team members, a nd that you value their ideas and will strive to resolve any disagreements in a relationship-\u00adcentered manner. Teamwork concepts are addressed in Module 38, and more specifically around the care of older patients in a \"case study.\" (10) Help the tea m establish a clea r, explicit understanding of the scope of authority of its members. This requires clinicians to learn more about the scope of expertise of members of other disciplines. Will the social worker do the mental status and psychological a ssessments, but not the clinician? Will the pha rmacist change medication orders before or after checking with the clinician?) Decide how disagreements will be resolved, including who will make the f inal decision to resolve disagreements. When off ering assessment or recommendation to a practitioner from another discipline: Routinely give your reasoning. Provide evidence whenever possible. Make it clear that you welcome being asked to provide evidence or reasoning for your opinion. Use terms common to the two disciplines or explain unfamilia r ones. Clinicians routinely use a large number of abbreviated terms - CHF, DOE, PND, etc. Establish the habit of using the full term. When listening to practitioners f rom another discipline: Begin with positive regard f or practitioners and their opinion. Understand the content clearly, asking for clarification when needed.Inquire for reasoning and evidence. Provide positive feedback. Meet periodically to discuss process and problems in team function. GERIATRIC ROUNDS Working with acutely ill geriatric patients in the hospital often requires extra thoughtfulness, specif ic interviewing strategies a nd attention to your own and the patient's attitudes, values and goals of care.

Abstract PURPOSE: To test the assumption that knowledge, a ttitudes, and skills (KAS) in geriatrics are learned via exposure to elderly patients in nongeriatric clerkships. In the developed world, the proportion of adults > or = 65 years old will soon surpass the proportion of children <14. However, clinica l clerkships containing geriatric rotations a re not mandated by the Liaison Committee f or Medical Education. METHOD : The authors assessed differences in geriatrics-\u00adfocused KAS between medical students who completed a rotation in eldercare and those who completed a tra ditional nongeriatric clerkship. Over two academic years, the authors randomly assigned 263 clinical clerks to a clerkship year that did (eldercare group) or did not contain a two-\u00adweek rotation f ocused on geriatrics. All students completed questionnaires tha t assessed their knowledge of and attitudes toward geriatric patients before and af ter their clerkships. Before graduation, all students completed an objective structured clinica l examination (OSCE) including a clinical station focused on geriatrics. RESULTS: Questionnaire and OSCE station respo nse rates were and 100%, respectively. The eldercare group had signif icantly higher knowledge scores (P = .004). Students' attitudes toward older adults worsened over the clerkship year in both groups, but slightly less in the eldercare group; that group had signif icantly higher OSCE geriatric station scores and overall pass rates (both: P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Geriatrics is often regarded as a nonessential discipline. This study showed, however, that a clerkship year containing a specia lized geriatric rotation is signif icantly more effective than a traditiona l clerkship year in prepa ring students to care for an aging population.

AbstractWhen medical schools change their curricula, this opens up opportunities for the development of new material and often eliminates previously designed courses. Emory University' s School of Medicine revised its curriculum in 2007, combining clinical medicine and basic sciences in the first 18 months. As part of its f irst section on \"The Healthy Human,\" it included a weeklong module on aging. The main objective of this study was to evaluate attitudes a nd knowledge about a ging issues before and af ter the course. The course included 5 days of sessions on topics ra nging from molecular biology to societal aspects of aging.Students completed a survey including demographics, the University of California at Los Angeles Geriatrics Attitudes Sca le (UCLA-\u00adGAS), and the Facts on Aging Quiz-\u00ad1 (FAQ1) bef ore and after the course. The UCLA-\u00adGAS measures attitudes toward geriatric patients on a 5-\u00ad point Likert scale, and the FAQ1 is a 25-\u00aditem true-\u00adf alse test on knowledge of aging. A ll 130 first-\u00adyear students completed the precourse survey, and 129 completed the postcourse survey. Four students said they planned to pursue specialty training in geriatrics before the module, and 10 planned to do so after the course (P=.28 using Fisher exact test). Mean UCLA-\u00adGAS score was 3.7+/-\u00ad0.4 before the class and 3.8+/-\u00ad0.4 after (P<.001 using paired t-\u00ad test). Mean of correct answers on FAQ1 was 16.1+/-\u00ad2.4 before the class and 17.5+/-\u00ad2.3 after (P<.001 using paired t-\u00adtest). This weeklong course on aging for first-\u00adyear medical studen ts at Emory improved their attitudes toward elderly people and their knowledge base on aging.

Knowledge and att itudes abo ut geriat rics o f medical st udents, internal medicine resident s, and geriatric medicine fellows. Kishimoto M, Nagoshi M , Williams S, et.al. Department of Medicine, John A. Burns School of Medicine, University of Hawaii, Honolulu. Abstract OBJECTIVES: To evalua te the attitudes a nd knowledge of medical students (MS1-\u00ad3), internal medicine residents (postgraduate years 1 to 3 (PGY1-\u00ad3)), and geriatric medicine f ellows about elderly patients before implementation of a new geriatrics curriculum. DESIGN: Cross-\u00ad sectional study. SETTING: An academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred eleven people participated: 54 MS1, 52 MS2, 50 MS3, 20 PGY1, 12 PGY3, and 11 geriatric medicine fellows. MEASUREMENTS: Each participant completed a questionnaire, including a 16-\u00aditem geriatrics attitude scale, and a 23-\u00aditem knowledge test (both revised versions of the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) Geriatrics Survey). Pearson correlation coefficients and t tests were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: B oth surveys demonstrated high internal consistency (alpha=0.70 and 0.71, respectively). Knowledge test scores increased with advancing level of training. MS 1 and MS2 scored signif icantly lower and fellows scored signif icantly higher than others. PGY3 scored significantly higher than PGY1 on the knowledge test. All group s demonstrated positive attitudes toward geriatric patients (score>3.5). MS1 and f ellows had signif icantly more favorable a ttitudes scores tha n more advanced students and residents. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the UCLA Attitudes Sca le and Knowledge Test can be used reliably to assess attitudes a nd knowledge level across all levels of medical education and training.

AbstractThe present study exa mined age dif ferences in the identification of anxiety and depressive symptoms in a community sample of 374 adults, ages 18 to 93. Older adults were less accura te and more likely than younger adults to label symptoms as neither anxiety nor depression. Both older and younger adults were mo re accura te in their classif ication of depressive than anxiety symptoms. These findings suggest that additional ef forts a re needed to educate the general public, particularly older adults, about anxiety and its symptoms.PMID: 19684501 [PubMed -\u00ad indexed f or MED LINE]PMCID PMC Article loading.. loading..

INTRODUCTION Smoking is the # 1 preventable cause of mortality in the U.S. Clinician treatment of tobacco use is straightforwa rd and cost-\u00adeffective. Clinician intervention f or tobacco use and dependence is one of the most cost-\u00adeffective interventions in he alth care. (6, 7) All clinicians play an important role in inf luencing and helping smokers to quit. A dditional evidence shows that training community providers who are not professionals to briefly counsel smokers promotes quitting beha vior. (3, 19) Demonstrating to providers that quitting is not an \"event\", but a stepwise \"process\" is a primary training goal. Just as smokers need to view temporary abstinence as a definite success, clinicians must recognize that a skillf ul and brief intervention can change patients' attitudes a nd behaviors. Public Health Service Guideline Strong evidence supports the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation that tobacco intervention be a top clinical priority. Smoking causes cardiovascular and respiratory disease, and also complica tes chronic conditions and pregnancy. The 2008 U.S. Public Health Service (PHS ) Clinica l Practice Guideline (CPG) for Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence comprehensively reviews the evidence and concludes that brief a dvice -\u00ad even less than 3 minutes -\u00ad increases quit rates. (7) A dose-\u00adresponse rela tionship exists between intensity of trea tment and quitting. Further, treatment that includes both behaviora l and pharmacologic interventions is more eff ective thaneither element alone. However, even brief interventions are effective. The PHS CPG details evidence for effective treatments: pharmacotherapy (i.e., nicotine replacement, bupropion, varenicline), and practica l counseling that may include problem-\u00adsolving skills training and social support. (6, 7) Motivational interventions are also recommended f or tobacco users who are not ready to quit. The full PHS CPG can be f ound at: http://www.a hrq.gov/professionals/clinicians-\u00ad providers/guidelines-\u00adrecommendations/tobacco/index.html Quitt ing, an Arduo us Journey Because smoking is a chronic and complex behavior with multiple determinants, achieving abstinence is arduous, both f or patients and f or the clinicians who seek to help them quit. Tobacco use is woven into the fa bric of a person's life. Smokers think regularly about quitting; they want to change, but strong physiological, psychological, and socia l factors impact on wheth er they will reach for another cigarette. Change is sometimes abrupt -\u00ad for example, after a heart attack. Most of the time, however, quitting is a challenging process, a nd abstinence requires that a smoker not only eliminate nicotine dependence, but also cope with living without tobacco. The process is strenuous, iterative and fluctuating - with repeated cycles of abstinence and resumption of smoking before achievement of stable abstinence. Hence, tobacco dependence is a chronic remitting a nd relapsing disorder, similar in this regard to asthma, heart f ailure or depression. Patients' quest f or abstinence sometimes seems impossible. As with any chronic condition, successful clinician intervention depends on appropriate assessment, a trusting relationship and skillful informing and a dvising of patients. When abstinence is elusive, ef fective clinicians ma intain a long-\u00adterm perspective, continue to partner with patients in a patient-\u00adcentered way and discern strategies appropriate f or the particular individua l. Productive and satisfying patient interactions arise when clinician and patient focus on realistic goals that \"meet smokers where they are\". (16) Clinicians who intention ally support patients' explora tion of feelings, obstacles a nd options can signif icantly shorten the abstinence quest. (6, 7) Obst acles Severa l serious obstacles negatively a ffect patient encounters and often block progress toward quitting -\u00ad including the myths described below. Click the links below to learn about myths that hold professionals back: 1. Myth #1: Smo kers don't want to quit Fact: many smokers would like not to smoke, although fewer a re ready to try at any given moment. 2. Myth #2: Smo kers can quit if they really want to Fact: long-\u00adterm abstinence requires more than just an attitude or desire or \"willpower.\" 3. Myth #3: Smo king treat ment s don't wo rk Fact: ra ndomized clinical trials show that effective therapies such as behavioral counseling, medications, social support (from a clinician as well a s from others in the individual' s social network), and repeated interventions increase quit rates, and long term abstinence.Myth: No Desire to Quit FACT: most smokers would like not to smoke, and about half of them attempt to quit in any one year. \"Smokers don' t want to quit\", expresses clinicians' belief that smokers have little desire to quit. The belief is partly based on many smokers' statement that they enjoy smoking. The myth may also derive f rom the complex and often negative or painful dynamics of working with chr onic behaviora l conditions in medical settings. D ata show that at about 70% of smokers want to quit smoking, and almost half make a serious attempt to quit each year. Of those who make an attempt, 4-\u00ad7% are successf ul. (13) A clinician encountering smokers 2 or 3 times in a year ma y erroneously assume they have been continuously smoking, when in fact they have made one or more quit attempts during this period. Myth: No Willpo wer Fact: long-\u00adterm abstinence requires more than determination or \"willpower.\" Clinicians ca n effectively treat nicotine dependence, and should work with smokers just as they would manage patients with any complex, chronic or intracta ble condition. Smokers constantly hear that cigarettes are a bad 'habit' that can be ' kicked' any time. A s a result, patients frequently lament, \"I know it's bad for me, I guess I don't have the willpower to give it up.\" This f alse line of thinking gives smokers total responsibility for quitting. The patients a re participating in \"blaming the victim,\" in this case themselves, the victims of a n addictive process. Nicotine is a powerful psychoactive drug, and smoking produces both psychological and physiological dependence. Myth: No Effect ive T reatment FACT: randomized clinical trials show that eff ective therapies include counseling and medications, and tha t repeated interventions increase quit attempts a s well as long term abstinence. Patients frequently bemoan their sense of failure and frustra tion, saying, \"I tried the patch, and it didn't work,\" or, \"I did what you said, but I picked up a gain at a party. \" Without a \"magic bullet\" for to bacco use, it is no wonder that health professiona ls share patients' lack of confidence about treatment. Af ter any given encounter, even when competent clinicians counsel patients and employ the most eff ective treatments, only a minority achieve sustained abstinence. Clinicians begin to doubt their own competence as well a s patients' motivation, and then find that their own motivation to intervene dec reases. B ut data presented in the PHS CPG clearly show that most smokers who use combinations of therapies will achieve at least temporary abstinence, and tha t short periods of abstinence can be leveraged to increase patient and clinician commitment and confidence to try again. (6, 7, 21) BRIEF INTERVENTION Short structured smoking interventions can be applied every day in the course of usual patient care. Successful approaches are patient-\u00adcentered and colla borative recognizing both the complexity of nicotine dependence and the slow process of behaviora l change. A brief intervention for tobacco dependence can be delivered in any medical setting, including during a telephone call. Designating an intervent ion as \"brief\" implies tha t the tobacco discussion takes only a few minutes, not that the interaction is inef fectual or insufficient. Tobacco dependence interventions derive from models of brief health beha vior change counseling as well a s patient self -\u00admanagement counseling for other chronic conditions, such as diabetes a nd obesity. (8, 31) The use of appropriate skills to address smoking is not assoc iated with longer visits. (6, 7, 11, 19) The 2008 CPG includes a Quick Ref erence Guide for Clinicians. (7) Research shows that both patients and providers report greater satisfaction when providers discuss smoking cessation, emphasize preventive care and discuss behavior change. (26) Clinicians f requently discuss tobacco use, but less often of fer assistance f or quitting. (6, 7, 28) Simple expla nations for this discrepa ncy include lack of provider skill and competing demands during visits. However, more insightful study shows that clinicia ns' fears that smokers will become irritated and \"difficult,\" when added to the myths cited above tend to curtail discussion. But the facts debunk the myths, a nd clinicians can build trust that minimizes irritation and supports effective discussion. Video is loading ... Brief Intervent ion Introduct ion by Michael Go ldstein MD Communicate Co ncern Directly state interest in patients' context, conflicts and beliefs, and withhold admonitions. Patients who smoke are sensitive to criticism, given the rise in cigarette taxes, smoke-\u00adfree policies and public health progra ms that target tobacco use. Smokers expect to be admonished by friends, co-\u00adworkers, f amily and health pr ofessiona ls. A judgmental question such as, \"You were just in the hospita l with a heart attack -\u00ad haven' t you smoking?\" feeds into this expecta tion, heightens def ensiveness, puts patients on guard and erodes their confidence. An empathic alternative would be to state, \"I'm interested in hearing how things went with your smoking after the heart attack.\" Even better, listen carefully while reviewing the interval history, as many patients will bring up smoking, which allows the clinician to respond supportively, strengthening the relationship uponwhich both medical and smoking interventions depend so heavily. Ta ke the initiative to tailor comments so they renew patients' interest in stopping, support their commitment, and boost their confidence. TOBACCO DEPENDENCE Nicotine addiction is common and withdrawal of nicotine a powerf ul stimulus to pick up another cigarette. The more \"hooked\" one is, the more intensive trea tment should be. In this section you f ind more in-\u00addepth information about: Nicotine Nicotine' s combination of stimulant a nd depressa nt effects, its quick uptake by bra in tissue and its subtle but very irritating withdrawal effects produce a ddiction that is difficult to break. Intensifying t reatment may help t hose who are mo re dependent Ability to achieve sustained abstinence and to avoid relapse correlate roughly with intensity of dependence and relevant medical co-\u00admorbidity. Nicotine Nicotine' s combination of stimulant a nd depressa nt effects, its quick uptake by bra in tissue and its subtle but very irrita ting withdrawa l symptoms produce addiction that is difficult to break. Nicotine reaches the brain less than 10 seconds af ter in halation and achieves maximum concentrations within 1 minute. Nicotine has both stimulant a nd depressa nt effects that contribute to its addictive properties. Nicotine' s almost instantaneous entry into neurons, in combina tion with its effects on brain function optimizes conditions for the development of physical dependence. Acute (minutes and hours) and chronic (weeks and months) tolera nce to nicotine effects contributes to an increa se in cigarette consumption, as people must smoke more to obtain desired effects. Learned or conditioned factors, genetics, a nd social and environmenta l factors contribute to dependence, but to a f ar smaller extent than the neurological ef fects of the drug. (35) At least 50% of smokers trying to quit experience signif icant withdra wal symptoms. Withdra wal symptoms appear within two hours, usually peak after 24 to 48 hours, and typically last f rom a few days to four weeks. (10, 35) Cra ving, increased hunger, a nd dreaming about smoking can persist for months. For some smokers, especially women, concerns about weight ga in may deter quitting or even motivate starting to smoke. Most smokers gain weight after quitting, generally fewer than 10 pounds, but there is a broad range with as many as 10 percent of quitters gaining as much as 30 pounds (Fiore 2008). Women tend to gain more weight than men when they quit smoking. Suggestions for addressing post-\u00adcessation weight gain are included in the CPG. Eff ective pharmacotherapy f or managing nicotine withdrawal reduces symptoms of withdrawal, increases quit rates, and ma y delay post-\u00adcessation weight gain. Treatment Intensit y Achieving abstinence and avoiding relapse correlate with intensity of dependence and relevant medical co-\u00admorbidity. Studies show that smokers more dependent on nicotine have grea ter difficulty quitting tha n less dependent smokers. (18) The Fagerst r\u00f6m Tolerance Questio nnaire measures dependence; in an off ice setting, a brief Heaviness o f Smoking Index can estimate the degree of dependence from answers to two questions: How soon after you wake up do you smoke your first cigarette? On average, how many cigarettes do you smoke per day? Certain types of smokers require more intensive interventions - usually a combina tion of behaviora l strategies and medication. Individuals smoking within 30 minutes af ter arising, or smoking 25 or more cigarettes per day have higher levels of dependence. (9) Individua ls who have not been able to get through 24 hours of abstinence in the p ast ma y require longer active treatment. Psychiatric co-\u00admorbidity such a s anxiety and mood disorders, other substance a buse disorders and schizophrenia is associated with higher prevalence of smoking and more dif ficulty achieving abstinence from tobacco use. Relapse after quitting is common, and in ra ndomized trials of pharmacothera py, rates approach 80%. These f indings support the need for a consiste nt, well-\u00ad integrated and ta ilored approach to treating tobacco use and dependence. Certain medical conditions may actually improve success with quitting. For example, quitting rates are higher among hospitalized patients undergoing coronary bypass or admitted for myocardial inf arction.(22) Any condition that is directly related to tobacco use provides a \"teachable moment:\" a n opportunity f or clinicians to engage in persona lized discussions about tobacco use and about the benefits of quitting. (6) THE 5A's OF TOBACCO COUNSELING Extensive resea rch indicates that clinicia n use of the \"5 A' s\" helps patients quit. in addition, skillful \"basic\" communication, pharmacotherapy, assistance with problem-\u00adsolving and skill-\u00ad building f or patients contribute to success. The CPG, Public Health Service Clinical Practice Guideline (7) f eatures the 5 A' s framework f or counseling patients about smoking cessation (Table 1). The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force's Counseling and B ehavioral Interventions Work Group recommends the same framework f or counseling about health behavior change. (8, 31, D ocCom Module 16) The 5A's emphasize motivational and educa tional needs, collaborating with patients to choose goals tha t are realistic and appropriate and tailoring counseling interventions accordingly. Table 1: The 5 A's [Modif ied from (7)] 1. Assess -\u00ad identify a nd document tobacco use status for every patient at every visit, and assess past behavior, motivation, importance and confidence; 2. Advise -\u00ad quitting, and persona lize to patient's health status and concerns, 3. Agree -\u00ad on goals and methods, based on willingness to quit 4. Assist -\u00ad with a tailored plan that addresses barriers to quitting and accords with patients' willingness to quit 5. Arrange -\u00ad follow-\u00adup In addition to 5 A's counseling, the PHS Guideline recommends tha t tailored treatment plansinclude the f ollowing: Recommend an approved pha rmacotherapy regimen Encourage both counseling and medication Problem-\u00adsolve with patients and tea ch them skills that help with quitting; Help patients access \"quitlines\" or more intensive treatment programs When you focus interview time on addressing tobacco use, your interaction differs in important respects from other interviews, but also contains many familiar elements. New skills relate to assessing motiva tion/readiness to change, and impo rtance and co nfidence a bout change. In this DocCom Module, we show how small modifications of the essential communication skills of gathering info rmatio n, (Module 8) understanding pat ients' perspect ives, (Module 9) and sharing info rmat ion (Module 10) converge in the 5 A's Mo del. The 5A framework f its well with other behavior change models proven effective in enhancing smoking outcomes, including the Transtheoretica l Model of Change (20), Social Cognitive Theory (2), Self-\u00adDetermina tion Theory ( 32) a nd Motivational Interviewing. (17) In the following sections, we describe the 5A's approach to Tobacco Counseling, providing examples of the skills for each \"A\". Assess The dialog below demonstra tes guiding discussion, asking permission, a nd using open-\u00adended questions and ref lections to begin an a ssessment. Prepare f or a \"no\" answer when asking permission. Start by guiding the conversation to smoking and tobacco use. Specif y your intention to help the patient to modify health risk behaviors. For example, you might begin with, \"I would like to talk with you about health behaviors and how you can modify these to promote good health. I noticed on the health history f orm you completed that you smoke.\" Pause hereand allow patients to share something spontaneously about their smoking, providing implicit permission to go on. If they don' t spea k, ask permissio n to continue the discussion, such as, \"Would it be OK to talk about your smoking and how it may be affecting your health?\" Asking pa tients' permission to proceed gives patients control and helps minimize resistance to change. Once patients say YES, they at least agree to consider how smoking aff ects their health. When asking permission, howeve r, be prepa red for patients to say 'NO'. Though rare, if it happens, you can respectfully reflect disinterest with, \"Seems like you are not willing to talk about smoking today.\" Sometimes this simple reflection opens the door to further discussion. However, if patients reiterate their wish to avoid a discussion, you can say.... \"Ok, though I hope you will be willing to talk about it sometime, because stopping smoking is the single most important thing you can do to reduce your risk for future illness.\" Once permission to proceed is granted, use open-\u00adended questions to learn about the patients' smoking history, belief s about smoking and its health effects, a nd their conviction (importance) and confidence a bout quitting. Use reflective listening to state the meaning of what you heard,pausing to allow the pa tient to verify, correct, ref ine or add more information. The following dialogue demonstrates elements of an initial assessment: Doctor: \"So I noticed f rom your history form that you smoke?\" Patient: \"Yeah...I know I should give them up.......it is not good f or my breathing .\" Doctor: \"So, you're aware smoking is having a nega tive impact on your asthma...you have been thinking of giving them up.\" Patient: \"Yeah, I' d really like to give them up.....my wife would like me to also....it's hard to think about g etting through the day without them. I've cut down to about a pack a day, though....I used to smoke 2 packs. Doctor: \"I am glad to hear that you know quitting will help us to better manage your asthma and make your wife happy. Sounds like you have worked hard to cut down, but are concerned about how you would manage without cig arettes. Patient: \"I have never been able to quit...I thin k I'm pretty addicted..\" Doctor: \"So you think you are addicted to cigarettes based on your dif ficulty quitting. Sounds like you have tried....wha t was that like?\" Patient: \"Well, I used some nicotine gum...but it bothered my teeth and gums.....so I gave it up after about a week and went rig ht back to smoking .\" Doctor: \"That must have been frustrating. Yet, you managed to stay quit for a week?\" Patient: \"It w as more like 5 tha t is an accomplishment!\" Patient: \"I never thought of it that way....but I guess you are right. I'd never gone more than a day without cigarettes before.\" Employ Relatio nship Skills Most pa tients are reluctant to dialogue about their smoking. B uild sa fety by using core relationship skills such as reflections, affirmations, empathic statements and statements that normalize (\"legitimize\") patients' experience. The example dialogue above shows the utility of open-\u00adended questions and requests, and the clinician also uses a series of effective reflectio ns to confirm data, allowing patients to add and refine their views regarding smoking. Note the affirmatio ns (\"I am glad to hear\", \"you have tried\", was an accomplishment\") of stat are concerned\"...\"that sounds f rustra These relationship-\u00adbuilding skills are vital elements of successf ul interventions whether or not the patient is right now ready to quit smoking. The statements assure patients that you are concerned but not judgmenta l and fa cilitate their disclosure of more information a bout their feelings and belief s, as well a s their a ttendance to your recommendations. (17) Assess Mot ivation to Quit Assessment of motiva tional readiness or stage of cha nge improves clinician ef fectiveness by enabling them to tailor interventions to patients' readiness. Many smokers are interested in stopping tobacco, but only some are prepa red to take action to quit. Clinicia ns are most ef fective when they adjust their dialogue to match patients' readiness to change. The Stages of Change model posits tha t change is a process of moving through severa l stages, not a sudden \"event\". (20) A smoker in the stage of preco ntemplatio n has no interest in quitting in the foreseea ble future. A patient in cont emplat ion is ambivalent about quitting and not willing to make a commitment to change. Someone in preparat ion intends to quit within the next month, or has made recent changes in smoking behavior, and a smoker in act ion has recently quit and is using strategies to remain abstinent. Those in maint enance have quit for at least 6 months. Relapse to smoking is a frequent and entirely norma l occurrence, and smokers should be re-\u00ad assessed to determine motivational rea diness at this time. Limiting clinician intervention to persuading, lecturing about harms, or recommending a ction strategies is never effective and is frus trating f or you a nd the patient. In contrast, tailoring interventions, f or exa mple, by reviewing information on smoking' s effects on their health to increase contemplative patients' awareness is both more eff ective and more satisfying.. (See the Agree and Assist sections below for more details on tailoring). Assess Impo rtance and Co nfidence Assessing importance and confidence creates explora tory dia logue. Asking \"why not a lower number\" encourages additiona l disclosure of beliefs and knowledge. The explorations facilitate tailoring of advice and assistance. Impo rtance is wha t patients believe about the value or importance of giving up cigarettes. Confidenc e, also known as self-\u00adeff icacy, is what patients believe about their ability to quit despite obstacles. Gathering information a bout importance and confidence helps to define smokers' readiness f or change, a nd allows you to tailor the \"advise\" and \"assist\" steps. You can use a numerica l rating scale to clarif y patients' belief s about value and ability.Figure 1: Visual Ruler (adapted from (14)) The following demonstrates how to use the conviction ruler to assess a young woman's motivation to quit smoking: Doctor: \"I would like to turn our attention to your heath behaviors. What about smoking?\" Patient: \"I'm still smoking......but I have cut down to less than a pack a day.\" Doctor: \"I am glad to hear that you' ve cut down.\" At this point, how convinced are you that it is important to quit smoking, say on a scale of 0 - 10, where 0 is not at all important and 10 is extremely important?\" Patient: \"Right now?\". Doctor: 5.\" Doctor: \"OK, a 5....so somewhat important. What led you to say 5 and not lower?\" Patient: \"Well I know smoking is making my sinus condition worse......a nd you have told me repeatedly about all the ot her problems it can ca use.. it's just so hard to think about not having my cigarettes.\" Doctor: \"So, you understand several reasons why quitting smoking would be benef icial. You would have f ewer sinus infections and less chance of developing other serious medical problems, including heart disease and cancer. Anything else that led you to say a 5?\" Patient: \"Well, I am hoping to get pregnant in the next year or so. I know smoking would not be good f or my baby.\" Doctor: \"You seem well informed about the risks of smoking during pregnancy.\" Patient: \"Yeah...and so is my husband! He has been on my case as well.\" Doctor: \"So, he'd be f or sure!\"Doctor: \"What would it take for you to feel it was even more important to quit smoking?\" Patient: \"I guess if I knew I would be able to do it....as I said, I don't know how I would manage without my cigarettes.\" Doctor: \"So you are worried about getting by without cigarettes. Tell me more about what you mean.\" In this example, the clinicia n learns about the patient' s beliefs. The questions, \"What led you to say 5 and not 1 or 2?\" and \"what else?\" elicited her reasons for quitting -\u00ad she made her own argument f or change! This technique, called eliciting \"change talk\" increases the likelihood of change (17). The basic relationship -\u00ad building statements of reflection and a ffirmation allowed the patient to state her own ideas, moving seamlessly to the open-\u00adended question tha t begins deeper explora tion of the patient's confidence about quitting. Typically, the assessment would continue with, \"On the same 0-\u00ad10 scale, how confident are you that you could quit f or a month?\" and f ollow with, \"Tell me, what gives you the strength to say '5', and not 0 or 1?\" which a gain is likely to elicit \"change talk,\" this time about the patient's strengths. (Note that asking \"Why are you not higher than '5?\" results in patients' talking about their limits, not their strengths. Addressing barriers is important, but it is better to begin with strong points. DocCom Module 16) Advise Quitt ing Whenever you discuss smoking, include at least brief advice or information, asking permission to do so and persona lizing it. Never lecture, and \"roll with resistance.\" Evidence shows that even very brief advice increases quit rates. (7) Enhance giving of a dvice by personalizing it ba sed on assessment of patient s' symptoms, risks, readiness, values and concerns. Be vigilant that \"brief advice\" does not morph into lecturing and persuading, which always feels like attack or criticism to patients, and increa ses resistance and ba rriers to success. This is particularly so for smokers with low importance regarding quitting. When a ssessment shows a low level of readiness to quit, ask permission to briefly off er advice or information. Patients rarely say \"no\" and the act of asking supports autonomy and increases patients' receptivity to the advice. B e willing to a ccept a \"no\", a difficult prospect f or many health professiona ls. After a \"no\" response, you might add a reflection, for example, \"Sounds like you don't want my input rig ht now.\" This simple reflection is a n example of rolling with resist ance, a tactic that helps avoid the unproductive, resistance-a ugmenting path of argumentation or pa tient \"change talk\" that ref lects towards considering quitting. Consider the example below: Clinician: \"So, you a re not considering quitting smoking right now. Would it be ok if I shared my thoughts about how stopping smoking will benefit your health?\" Patient: \"To be honest, ....no...I don' t want any lectures .\" Clinician: \"So, you don' t want to hear my advice right now.\" Patient: \"Well I know all about that scare stuf f. I know smoking is not good f or my health. I don' t need you to tell me that. again.\" Clinician: \"I hear you. Sounds like you are alrea dy aware of the downside of smoking.\"Patient: \"Yes......Listen, I know you are trying to do your job and I apprecia te your concern.....I am just not ready to quit smoking.\" Clinician: \"OK.....well, when you are ready...I' m holidays.\" Clinician: \"That would be great.\" In this example, asking permission and using simple reflections led to the patient's own expression of a reason to quit, \"I know smoki ng is not good f or my health\" and even some interest in quitting in the future! The clinician responded to this \"change talk\" with affirmatio n, and wisely, did not extinguish the patient' s small move into change territory, respecting the patient' s \"no\" response and not giving f urther advice or recommendations When a dvice is subsequently shared, personalize the advice by ma king links to improvements in health and well-\u00adbeing that the patient is likely to experience in the short-\u00adterm or to other hopes or interests. See APPEND IX for Timetable of Benefits associated with quitting smoking. Agree: Basics Following \"Assess\" and \"Advise\", engage in colla borative discussion in order to \"Agree\" with patients about goals and next steps. Patients' active participation of in a goal-\u00adsetting process is associate d with improved outcomes in studies of dietary, alcohol, and dia betes self -\u00admanagement counseling. (8) Collaborative goal-\u00ad setting is a decisive determinant of successf ul tobacco interventions, a nd too often absent f rom clinician-\u00adpatient encounters. Time that spent seeking agreement on clear and realistic goals is time well used. The interview goal is to colla boratively a gree on specific outcomes by a specif ic time (such as the next visit) that a re both desirable and achievable. (D ocCom Module 11) The outcome goal patients agree to choose often falls short of abstinence now and f orever-\u00ad the most healthf ul outcome. As a n informed health professional, you ma y have difficulty \"settling for less\" than optimal goals. However, remembering that patients are in full control of their a ctions may help you to relinquish trying to control or mold their a genda. Giving up trying to shape their agenda helps lower pa tients' resistance, a nd increases likelihood of making progress toward optimal outcomes at a later time. When patients are not willing to agree to quit, consider \"motivational\" interventions (below). If they are ready to quit, move on to the \"Assist\" step. Agree: St rategies Use relationship skills t o help patients clarif y and ascertain their own goals. Realistic a nd achievable goals will then be aligned with patients' importance a nd confidence. Create a collaborative process by reviewing and clarifying patients' goals, articulating your clinica l goals, and then finding common ground or negotiating a compromise. Show that you have heard patients' perspectives by making statements that legitimize their beliefs, thoughts and feelings (DocCom Modules 6, 9). This empathic stance helps patients trust that you seek to colla borate with them in establishing sensible goals.Ask patients to suggest goals a nd then jointly determine which ones are specific, realistic ad aligned with their readiness, importance and confidence. Assure that you and pa tients agree on goals that are based on patients' past experiences. Agreeing on an achievable goal is far better than persuading patients to assent to an \"optimal\" goal which they neither want nor are capable of reaching. A sensible goal encourages small successes instead of big failures and enhances the likelihood of succe ssful change. When smokers have little int ention to quit, a sensible expectation is for them to notice their thoughts a nd actions a round smoking, a suitable aim at this \"no intention\" stage. For such patients, you might state, \"Should you become more interested in trying to quit in the future, I am ready to support you and talk about the best trea tments available.\" (And, see more deta il in Table 2, bel ow). For smokers ambivalent about change (contemplating), a sensible expectation for the encounter is to ref lect on their belief s and to provide information that might increase the likelihood that the patient will consider quitting in the future. Reframe previous quit attempts a s learning opportunities -\u00ad sources of data about barriers and steps to success that can increase patients' confidence in future attempts to quit. Many smokers believe they must \"quit on their own.\" Thus, a sensible goal f or those preparing to quit might be to discuss why various medication and counseling interventions help. Most patients have no idea that their \"willpower\" can be a ugmented by receiving advice and nonjudgmental support from clinicians. When smokers are clearly ready fo r a quit attempt, a typica l encounter goal is to offer counseling and medication integra ted into a quit plan. Table 2 provides exa mples of encounter goals and related messa ges that are adjusted to readiness. Table 2. Tailo r messages t o goals fo r the enco unter.

In the example below, the clinician begins dialogue about realistic goa ls. Clinician: \"So, to summa rize, you tried to quit smoking several times in the past, and were able to go without smoking for about a week. Once when you used nicotine patches, you had fewer problems with cravings. Right now, you're thinking about quitting again.\" Patient: \"I am f rustrated about my smoking, but also a bout my weight. I think I need some more help to be successful.\" Clinician: \"OK. I' m hearing that you might try to quit ag ain, but don't want to gain weight.\" Patient: \"Right. I ca n't afford to gain 20 pounds.\" Clinician: \"What are your thoughts about wha t you would like to do now?\" Patient: \"Well, I would like to quit. I rea d there are pills to help you quit, a nd not gain weight.\"Clinician: \"It's great that you' re considering another try. Several medications can help increase success with quitting while limiting weight ga in, and we can review medication options as well as talk about other strategies tha t might help limit weight changes when you're not smoking?\" Patient: \"That would be great.\" Clinician: \"So, you're ready to quit smoking, and you are willing to take medications and consider other ways to limit weight ga in after quitting .\" Patient: \"Yes, I' d like t tr y using medicine, and I a m willing to consider other opti too.ons The clinician summarizes the assessment data and clarif ies the patient's readiness. The patient desires to quit smoking and wants trea tment that will help limit weight gain. The clinician ma kes empathic statements, reflects the patient's concerns about weight gain and expresses willingness to help address tha t barrier. Their collaborativ e process of reaching goal agreement sets the stage for the next element of 5 A' s counseling, Assisting the patient to develop a specific plan. Assist: Quit St rategies The \"Assist\" process builds upon the output of first three A' s -Assess, Advise and Agree. Collaboratively develop a plan f or quitting for smokers who are ready for action. For smokers who are prepared to try to stop, collaboratively identify a \"stop date\" -\u00ad pref erably within a few days or a week. and develop a quit pla n. Begin to assist patients with high impo rtance but lo w co nfidence by praising their decision-\u00ad this supports autonomy. Af firm past small success a nd apprecia te patients' traits or a ttributes that you perceive as strengths-\u00ad this supports self-\u00adef ficacy. Designing a f easible plan works best when patients identify stra tegies themselves. Ask patients, \"Based on your experience, what problems do you foresee when you try to not smoke?\" Listen, reflect their concerns, and then ask, \"What ideas do you have about overcoming such challenges?\" Identify what went wrong af ter a period of success a nd brainstorm what else could be put in place to achieve a more durable result. If patients have f ew or no ideas, of fer your own. Se ek strategies that enhance confidence. You can offer self-\u00adhelp ma terials, medications to reduce withdrawa l, and information about local in-\u00adperson progra ms and telephone quit lines. Explore potential supports in patients' family and social network. Enlist the clinical team to teach specif ic coping and self-\u00admanagement skills. Of fice staff can provide support with brochures, internet resources, referral information, a nd can arra nge follow-\u00adup. Clinician: \"You' ve set a date to quit. Can you tell me -\u00ad what challeng es do you see for you when that quit day gets here?\" Patient: \"Well, I don't have much trouble not smoking a t work. You have to go outside the parking lot, or sit in your car - and I don' t like doing that beca use I smell like smoke. But when I get home, it gets pretty tough.\" Clinician: \"It's not convenient to smoke a t work, and that supports your success during the day. When you get home, that's another story. What is it about being athome that ma kes it hard?\" Patient: \"When I come home, I want to relax and unwind, and smoking helps me do that. I usually watch the news and have 2 or 3 cig arettes then.\" Clinician: \"So, smoking a nd watching TV go together af ter work. What about last year, when you told me that you quit for a month - what did you do a fter work?\" Patient: \"Well, it was easier then because I lived with my boyfriend, who didn' t smoke, and we spent time together, took wa lks, cooked dinner...\" Clinician: \"OK, last time you quit, you were able to distra ct yourself at home. What could you do this time?\" Patient: \"I could spend more time with my daughter and call friends on the phone.\" Clinician: \"I wonder if these same challenges will happen on the weekends, too? Would it be helpful if you could write a list - rig ht here - about some ways to distra ct yourself outside of work.\" (Joint ly the clinician and pat ient brainsto rm a list). Clinician: \"...a ny other challenges you can think of?\" Patient: \"Well, I seem to do OK for a week or so, and then I have trouble concentra ting.\" Clinician: \"I'm g lad you mentioned this. Trouble concentra ting is a common symptom -of nicotine withdrawal. It sometimes can last as long as a month. Treatment can help: including medication ro reduce those symptoms, or counseling or coaching by a tobacco treatment specia list.\" Patient: \"Do you mean a stop smoking class?\" Clinician: \"That's one option. Another is a quit line, a free telephone program that helps many smokers get throug h the day and succeed at quitting. They call you back several times to see how thing s are going.\" Patient: \"I've heard a bout the quit line, but I can't imagine getting what I need by phone.\" Clinician: \"Many of my patients had the same reaction. They tried it and found that it was a big help. Would you be willing to give them a call? I ca n have our nurse write down the contact information.\" Patient: \"I guess I could.\" Clinician: \"Ok, sounds like you have a plan. Can you just summarize f or me?\" Patient: \"Sure...let' s see... I' m going to list some activit ies to distra ct myself at home, like ta lking with my daughter. And I' ll call the telephone smokers' line.\" Clinician: \"Great. I'd like to see you or speak to you in a few weeks.\" AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) Assist: Nico tine Dependence Design treatment plans that take account of nicotine dependence level and quitting history. Assure that plans align with patients' confidence level before making final decisions. For patients with lo w levels o f nicot ine dependence and both high importance and high confidence (more than 7) provide brief, supportive messages and offer medication therapy. Patients who relapse after a trial of nicotine re placement therapy (NRT) might try a non-\u00adnicotine medication or a medication combina tion. Reframe relapse after a period of abstinence as a success in order to dispel patients' typical notion that the medication \"f ailed to help.\" Combinations of different f orms of NRT or combination NRT and bupropion is more effective than monotherapy. (7) Use the quit experience as a starting place to determine whethe r alternative treatment plans are likely to prove more effective. Assess patients' confidence about their ability to carry out a new plan before providing closure. If their confidence is less than 7, success is less likely, and reasonable strategies in this situation include working to identify a nd resolve barriers until confidence is at least 7, or renegotiating and agreeing on a plan that patients believe they can achieve with confidence of at least 7. In contrast, smokers with high levels o f nico tine dependence are at high risk for relapse, despite high confidence. An initial step would be to prescribe higher doses of NRT or combina tion medication. Concurrent counseling through state-\u00adf unded or health plan telephone services is helpful and programs are now widely ava ilable.(34) D o not hesitate to offer highly nicotine dependent patients more intense behavioral therapy, either in the office or with a professional tobacco specialist. Assist: Not Ready to Quit For patients who reject the idea of change, suggesting change options is an impolite waste of time. Check out whether patients f eel hopeless. Respond with empathy, and roll with resistance. Very low importance and very low confidence can be loosely equated with f eeling \"helpless and hopeless.\" Patients need both high importance a nd at least modest confidence before you and they invest energy on changing. Few \"helpless and hopeless\" patients would be able to agree on a change goal, so pushing them towards active quitting steps is fruitless, f rustrating and erodes trust. Steadf astly ref rain from trying to persuade them to believe somet hing or do something that is either not very important to them, or about which they feel hopeless. Seek to comprehend their low level of importance by using the \"rulers\" a s a starting place to elicit the pros and cons of cha nging or, using the confidence ruler, problem-\u00adsolve with them about why they feel they ca nnot succeed. Listen attentively to their experience, responses, perspectives and feelings. Talk about the importance ruler: \"What makes it a 1 a nd not 0\" or even, \"Zero...that' s as low as you can g et...what would have to happen to make it a 1?\" You might find an opportunity for an affirmatio n, such as \"So, you realize that there are some potential benefits to change\". Legitimize the challenge for patients by reflecting on how hard it is to quit smoking. When providers say, \"Sounds like it' s been t ough for you quit,\"patients' struggle is validated. They also hear something that says - 'I'm listening to you'. Show that you wish to understand by reflecting back statements or the content of questions or objections. Oh, because your boyfriend does not want to stop, it is hard to imagine trying.\" \"I hear you saying that never being able to go beyond a day or two makes you f eel hopeless, and stuck at a \"1\" on confidence\" This kind of reflection is called \"rolling wit h resist ance\", and research shows that it often (not always!) encourages patients to think more broadly, to examine pros and cons, to trust you more, and to value and invest in the relationship. At the very least, accurate acknowledgement of their situation helps them keep coming back for more conversation instead of feeling resentful about your unwillingness to meet them where they are. After aligning with patients' perspective, you can make simple recommendations tha t communicate your concern and expertise. Provide some feedba ck and informa tion (f rom one sentence to many exchanges, depending on patient responses) so patients know that you think quitting is important. This might involve your wish to improve their heart condition or minimize risks for lung disease. Ask smokers to pay attention to their smoking behavior and discuss their f eelings with you a t a following visit. Recommend brochures or online resources (such a s www.ahrq.gov or www.cdc.gov) or talking with people who have quit. More information on these skills can be found in modules on promoting behavior change, alcohol disorders, diet a nd exercise, and substance abuse (DocCom Modules 24,25,29,30). Note that it is not \"giving up\" to mindfully loosen your natural urge to forge ahead, it is acknowledging the complexity of helping relationships. With respect to behavior cha nge, outcomes are entirely dependent on patients' a ctions. Clinician-\u00adpatient communication and other actions may influence outcomes, but only patients fully determine outcomes. Aligning yourself with patients is the best way to create new opportunities for finding common ground. AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) Assist: Relapse Help patients who relapse to combat their shame and hopelessness and stay engaged with change. Provide empathic support and additional inf ormation, reframe the rela pse as a learning opportunity, and brainstorm solutions to ba rriers. When patients quit, relapse within a few days is commonplace because nicotine withdrawa l symptoms provide strong impetus to smoke, and smoking provides instant relief (it feels miraculous). Looking a t relapse's positive aspect, it demon strates adherence to the quit plan and is an opportunity to rea ssess. Reassess motivation, provide more information a bout nicotine withdrawal, and explore feelings and supports. Patients become discouraged a nd disillusioned when their dependence is high and social supports for behavior change are inadequate. Your compassiona te statements a nd optimism will build relationship a nd trust. Then you will be able to explore importance and confidence again, and promote patients' continuing engagement in the process of change. AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) Arrange: Fo llow-\u00adup Arrange personal or telephone follow-\u00adup for patients in any stage of readiness, in order to check results, celebrate successes a nd review potential cha nges in importance or confidence. Patient follow-\u00adup is an essential aspect of the smoking intervention, whether contact is face-\u00adto-\u00ad face or by telephone. Follow-\u00adup is important even f or patients who are not ready to quit. B rief advice, even during a sin gle encounter, ma y tip the balance, and some smokers go on to make lasting change. For smokers attempting to quit, at least four contacts appea r optimal f or achieving sustained abstinence. Follow-\u00adup visits can be brief. (7) Assess treatment response, adjust medication and continue to provide supportive messages for quitting. The ef fective support technique of proactive telephone counseling can be cond ucted by clinical staff or a community resource. Continuation of medications may be appropriate a fter a relapse, if patients agree to set a stop date soon to resume abstinence. However, if assessment suggests pa tients are not motivated to develop a new quit plan, discontinue the therapies. Schedule a future rea ssessment and consider a new treatment plan. Strategies f or providing closure to visits and arranging follow up can be f ound in D ocCom Module 12. AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) CONCLUSION Clinician intervention f or tobacco use and dependence is one of the most cost-\u00adeffective interventions in health care. Counseling intensity correlates with quit rates, and even brief advice - less than 3 minutes - increases quit rates. The 5 A' s approach (Assess, Advise, Agree, Assist, Arrange) is a useful way to organize and customize tobacco use counseling and can be applied effectively for all patients who smoke, including those not ready to commit to quitting. Expressing empathy and building a trusting relationship are keys to successf ul 5 A' s counseling. Assessing patients' readiness to change, including calibration of both the importance they assign to quitting, and their confidence a bout quitting enables clinicians to adjust, tailor and customize counseling interventions so as to increase overall ef fectiveness. When smokers a re not ready t o quit, examine their \"pros\" about change, use reflective listening, provide empathic support and agree on a goal short of quitting - f or example to reflect about their smoking experience. When patients are ready to commit t o quitt ing, review past e xperiences and collaboratively choose among various evidence-\u00adbased treatment options, potentially including medications. When smokers relapse after trying t o quit, affirm successes, re-\u00adassess their importance and conf idence about quitting, consider more intensive forms of counseling and more intensive pharmacologic treatment and agree on a new goal based on their current readiness. Patient-\u00adcentered, respectf ul and tailored 5A' s counseling, when combined with evidence-\u00adbased pharmacological and behavioral treatments, not only enhances outcomes of tobacco dependence treatment but also increa ses sa tisfaction f or both patients and clinicians.

How confident are you tha t you can balance your own diet and physical activity to optimize your health? Consider why you are not more confident, and then why you are not less confident? 5. What would you need from your own clinician to learn to maintain healthy diet and physical activity? 6. How do your a ttitudes about motivation nutrition and physical activity a ffect your counseling? Key Principles: 1. Brief interventions by clinicians are eff ective at helping patients to improve nutrition and tobe more physica lly active. 2. Human motivation is psychologica l energy directed at specific goa ls. 3. Negotiating reasonable goals, listening with empathy, non-\u00adjudgmentally supporting patient needs, and believing that your patients can change helps patients to locate and sustain their motivation. 4. Changing eating and exercise habits requires that patients learn new information, intend to change, and persist at trial and error. 5. Most Americans need to reduce serving sizes and choose better quality foods. To do this we need to be able to: 1. Read food labels 2. Reduce portion size by about 25% 3. Avoid trans f ats 4. Insure that half of daily grain intake is whole grain. 5. Devote thirty minutes of physical activity per day a t moderate levels to prevent chronic disease, 60 minutes per day to maintain a stable weight, a nd 90 minutes per day to lose weight. Learning go als: At the co nclusion o f this mo dule, yo u will be able to : List evidence tha t good diet intake and daily physical activity promote health. Assess patients' diet and daily physical activity, and recommend specif ics of balanced energy intake and expenditure. Describe the ra tionale and evidence for using the 5 A's intervention stra tegy Demonstrate ability to assess interest in behavior change, elicit patient perspectives empathica lly, and express support of patient autonomy. Negotiate healthy change goals for diet and physical activity, and respond positively to lack of success. BACKGROUND The topics covered in the first section of this module are: Why sho uld clinicians o r health care practit ioners do the co unseling? Over 300,000 premature deaths per year in the US are attributa ble to unhealthy diet and physical inactivity (1). Always consider pat ient nutritio n and physical activity to gether. Despite major public health efforts, Americans are growing more obese, resulting in a n increased prevalence of chronic illness. Unfortunately, fewer than a third of patients receive lifestyle counseling from clinicians.Why sho uld clinicians o r health care practitio ners do the co unseling? Over 300,000 premature deaths per year in the US are attributa ble to unhealthy diet and physical inactivity (1). 55-\u00ad60 million Americans have prediabetes (2). People with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) often have obesity (especially abdominal or visceral obesity), dyslipidemia with high triglycerides and/or low HDL cholesterol, a nd hypetension. Structured lifestyle intervention aimed at increa sing physical activity a nd producing 5-\u00ad10% loss of body weight a nd certain pharmacologica l agents prevent or delay the development of diabetes in people with IGT (3). More than one third of people born in the U.S. 2000 will get diabetes (Type 2) bef ore dying (2). \"Trans fats\" a re found in high percenta ges in U.S. foods (e.g., margarines and fast f oods) an d are a major cause of cardiovascula r disease (3). Trans fats now appea r on all f ood labels. B alancing energy intake tha t includes daily physical activity of 60 minutes at a moderate level (walking 3-\u00ad4 mph) would drama tically lower rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, obesity, and cancer. Always consider pat ient nutritio n and physical activity together Despite major public health efforts, Americans are growing more obese, resulting in a n increased prevalence of chronic illness. Unfortunately, fewer than a third of patients receive lifestyle counseling from clinicians. The D ietary Guidelines f or Americans 2005 provide evidence based recommendations to balance energy intake and expenditure in order to prevent major chronic diseases (e.g., Type 2 diabetes, severa l cancers-\u00adincluding co lon cancer-\u00ad, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and degenerative arthritis) and to improve health and quality of life (6). American jobs have become increasingly sedentary, and Americans now are unlikely to expend enough energy during work to mainta in physical fitness or a healthy body weight. Over the past two decades portion sizes have increased dramatica lly (\"portion distortion\"-\u00ad http://hin.nhlbi .nih.gov/portion/ ), and have lef t patients and clinicians unable to identify healthy serving sizes (7). Obese adults underestimated their daily caloric intake by 47%, and overestimated their da ily energy expenditure by 51% even before this increase in portion size began (7). American adults gain an average of roughly 2 lbs per year (9). Together these \"forces\" have led the avera ge American to become overweight or obes e (60% of Americans), a nd to get inadequate amount of physical activity to maintain health (only 15 % are active at the recommended level, and 40% are sedentary). Yet, less than 30% of patients currently receive lifestyle counseling from their clinician (10). It seems that health care practitioners need as much motivating to do this counseling as patients need to make dieta ry and physical activity cha nges. It is likely that clinicians are the most potent motiva tors of patient life-\u00adstyle change, based on studies of counseling about tobacco and alcohol. This is because clinicians have unique access to patients, and because patients solicit a nd respect clinician advice. D octors have a greater impact on popula tion health tha n any other single health practitioner (11,12,13). If health care systems assist clinicians to provide counseling and a second type of health care provider is involved, the counseling is even more ef fective (14).COUNSELING PRINCIPLES In this section, the following topics a re covered: Motivatio n Motivation is energy directed at a particular goa l.You can energize your patients by having positive relationships, supporting their autonomy and promoting self-\u00adeff icacy. Suppo rt of patient autonomy Promoting patient autonomy, def ined as patient willingness to enga ge in a behavior, is motivating, yields better health outcomes and is fully consistent with engaging patients in the process of inf ormed decision making (8,19) Physical activity and nutrit ional ions As a clinician, you are an important motiva tor of change. Your patients will likely need to discuss change several times before trying to change and attempt change severa l times before being successf ul. Motivatio n Motivation is energy directed at a particular goa l. You can energize your patients by having positive relationships, supporting their autonomy and promoting self-\u00adef ficacy. The field of hea l th psychology has several theories of motivation that inform practitioners how best to counsel patients to change behavior (11). Motiva tion has two components: psychological energy and direction. Clinicia ns need to account for both these components of motivation to provide effective counseling. The \"direction\" of motivation has to do with negotia ting agreement with the patient on the health goal to be achieved. Thus, establishing clearly agreed upon goals for nutrition and physical activity becomes crucial to successful change. Psychological \"energy\" to reach those goals is f elt to come f rom a va riety of sources: positive rela tionships that support patients unconditionally, higher levels of autonomous self-\u00adregulation of the patients, and higher levels of perceived efficacy (or perceived competence ). Patients are likely to hear advice to change their behavior several times before they will begin efforts to change, and then are likely to try several times before they can maintain the change over time. There is a very strong dose response relation between amount of contact time and successful change in tobacco abstinence, yet even simple advice statements from clinicians increase abstinence rates 5 months later (14). It is likely that nutrition and physical activity counseling will also be more successf ul with greater contact time and with additional health care workers integrated into the support system (15). In this module, we recommend you spend 6-\u00ad9 minutes on counseling for diet and nutrition, a nd physical activity, and repeat this counseling over time (16,17). Suppo rt of patient auto nomy P romoting patient autonomy, defined as patient willingness to enga ge in a behavior, is motivating, yields better health outcomes and is fully consistent with engaging patients in the process of inf ormed decision making (18,19). In addition, promoting autonomy is one of three fundamental principles of medical care (20,21). Supporting autonomy serves as a clinical end-\u00adpoint for all health care encounters. Thus, not only is supporting autonomy associated with behavior change and better health, it is essential to providing ethical clinica l care. Researchers identif y seven clinician behaviors that support autonomy, and reduce the likelihood the patient will interpret the recommendations as controlling. These beha viors include: 1. Elicit patient perspectives before making recommendations (e.g. listen a ctively). 2. Acknowledge patient af fect related to the topic. 3. Negotiate health goals the patient is willing to pursue. 4. Identify and discuss effective options f or change versus not changing. 5. Discuss the disorders caused by poor diet and inactivity. 6. Present eff ective treatments and lifestyle change options. 7. Discuss risks and benef its of no treatment, a nd benef its and risks of treatment. 8. Provide your recommendations clearly and a rationale f or cha nge . 9. Elicit patient understanding and perspective regarding options. 10. Support patient initiatives for change. Recognize most people need to initiate change several times before they a re successful. 11. Negotiate a plan, including a time table for determining if the course of action wa s effective. 12. Minimize control. Physical activity and nutrit ional reco mmendat ions from Dietary Guidelines 2005 and nd As a clinician, you are an important motiva tor of change. Your patients will likely need to discuss change several times before trying to change and attempt change severa l times before being successf ul. Clinicians need to be able to provide specific recommendations in a straightf orward mann er that patients experience as motiva ting, a nd not as controlling. Patients are more likely to change if clinicians initiate these discussions (22). Ongoing follow-\u00adup is needed because most patients are unlikely to change on the basis of a single discussion, a nd most patients will need to attempt change severa l times before being successf ul. Key Recommendations f rom the Dietary Guidelines f or Americans 2005: 1. Consume fewer ca lories to remain healthy. 2. Be more physically active to remain healthy and weight management. 3. Make wiser f ood choices to remain healthy. 4. Avoid trans f ats (trans fats were added to food labels in 2006) THE WAVE AND REAP TOOLS The WAV E and REAP are valida ted for use in brief clinician discussions of nutrition and physica l activity. The WAVE assesses weight, activity level, variety of intake and excess intake. The REAP assesses food intake. (17, 23, 24) Assessment a nd counseling based on the WAV E and REAP is intended for general nutrit ion counseling, such a s in the time typically a llotted in primary care visits. If the patient has hypertension, the D ietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) is recommended by the D iet Guidelines (6).The PREMIER trial demonstrated that persons with hypertension can sustain multiple lifestyle changes that improve blood pressure control over 18 months (25). The D ASH Eating Plan is available at http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/public/heart/hbp/dash/new_dash.pdf . If the patient has complex problems, or is not able to make good progress in 3 to 6 months, then refer to a dietician for further assessment a nd counseling. The WAVE To ol The WAVE instrument can be downlo aded as a double sided pocket guide at http://med.brown.edu/nutrition/acrobat/wave.pdf (17). The WAVE has two sides; one for assessment, and the second f or recommendations. Each side is divided into four quadrants related to each letter of the acronym. The assessment side is intended to answer the following questions: Weight -\u00ad is the patient under or overweight? Activity -\u00ad does the patient get enough physical activity to optimize health? To manage weight? Variety -\u00ad is the patient eating a variety of foods from important sections of the food pyramid? Excess - is the patient eating too much? The recommendations side is to be used to guide your counseling once those questions a re answered. In order to assess whether the patient's \"variety\" of foods meets nutritional sta ndards, and to determine if the patient eats an \"excess\" of calories from a particular f ood group, the practitioner ca n complete a quick 1 day 24 hour food recall (estimated to take 3 -\u00ad5 minutes), compare f oods eaten with the Food Pyra mid recommendations, or complete the REAP with patients. The REAP Too l The REAP to ol can be downlo aded http://med.brown.edu/nutrition/acrobat/reapmdkey.pdf is the Clinician Key which a ids the provider in discussing the pa tient's answers and counseling them a bout recommended changes for each major dietary area. Patients can complete the REAP (written at the 5th grade level) in the waiting room to shorten time (estimated 10 minutes). The intervention using the REAP is illustrated in this module. Specifically, the REAP assesses intake of the fo llowing: Whole grains Calcium-\u00adrich f oods Fruits and vegetables, Fat Saturated fat and cholesterol-\u00adavoid trans fats Sugary beverages a nd foods SodiumThe REAP also assesses whether the patient: Engages in regular physical activity Prepares his or her own f ood Has trouble being able to shop or cook Follows a special diet Eats or limits certain foods f or health reasons Is willing to make changes to eat healthierAlcoholic beverages COUNSELING In this section you'll f ind the following topics covered: 1. The 5A's As a clinician, you should use 6-\u00ad9 minutes of counseling f or behavior change on physical activity a nd diet. 2. Integrating t he WAVE and REAP into the 5A's Diet and Physical Activit y Counseling Regular counseling about diet a nd physica l activity are needed f or Americans to reach Healthy Goals f or 2010 (26). ASSESS , Weight ADVICE , Activity AGREE ASSIST , Variety & Excess ASSIST , Reduce Calories ARRANGE The 5A's As a clinician, you should use 6-\u00ad9 minutes of counseling f or behavior change on physical activity a nd diet. This counseling is recommended for life style change as part of National Guidelines for Hypertension, Hypercholesterolemia , Diabetes a nd its prevention, Cardiovascula r Disease, Physica l Activity, and Obesity. The 5 A's include: (see also D ocCom module 16) Assess-\u00adbackground information regarding risk, beha viors, patient knowledge related to Physical Activity and D iet Advise-\u00adprovide a clear advice statement personalized to the patient's situation.

Assist-\u00adset a cha nge date, establish a change plan, problem solve and skills build, a nd support patients obtaining extra-\u00adtreatment support Arrange-\u00adFollow-\u00adup, establish a time frame for assessing eff ect of current plan Integrating t he WAVE and REAP into the 5A's Diet and Physical Activity Co unseling Regular counseling about diet a nd physica l activity are needed f or Americans to reach Healthy Goals f or 2010 (26). As you are learning the specif ic content outlined below, please consider your own motiva tion for incorporating the 5A's into your medical practice. You will need to adapt your office system to support your counseling practices. Most clinicians will need multiple change attempts to maintain using the 5A's in practice. Gradual change in your practice is likely to be more successful than trying to master all of the material at once. The specific tasks needed to complete the 5A's are outlined in the following para graphs. Much of the content of the counseling has been adapted from Blackburn & Waltman (16) to fit the 5A's format. Mr. R. is a 49 y.o. advertising executive who has been very successf ul in his work. He is married with 2 children 14 and 17 y.o. He has a BMI of 31 (see http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/bmicalc.htm ) and his blood pressure is 132/84 in your off ice today. His total cholesterol is 198 with an LDL of 125 and f asting blood glucose of 101 mg/dl. You have been his clinician for 4 years, since he moved to the area and his weig ht has increased by 2-\u00ad4 pounds each year. You a re seeing him for a health maintenance visit. Go the the next section using the tree-\u00admenu on the left or in clicking the section tit le below: ASSESS , Weight ADVICE, Activity AGREE ASSIST , Variety & Excess ASSIST , Reduce Calories ARRANGE In these sections, the 5A's and WAVE are indicated by those words in brackets. ASSESS, Weight Doc: \"I am starting to place more emphasis on nutrition and physical activity in my practice. You can tell by the diet questionnaire (REAP) tha t you were given to complete while you were waiting for me. Would it be alright to spend a few minutes going over this with you now? I think its important for your hea lth.\" Mr. R: \"Sure.\" Doc: \"I see that your weig ht has been increasing by a few pounds each year over the past few years. Your body mass index of 31 means that you are in the obese ca tegory.\" Mr. R: \"Yes, my new position has kept me busy at work, I just don't have time to get any exercise.\"Doc: : \"Often times these promotions have their costs as well a s benefits. Is this the most you have weig hed?\" Mr. R: \"Yes. It's hard to resist all the f ood we have at our meetings. We encourage people to work throug h lunch by providing good food.\" Doc: \"Well, you are experiencing what most Americans a re-\u00adga ining 2-\u00ad4 pounds per year,because jobs and diets like yours a nd mine no longer allow us to burn enough calories to maintain our health. Wha t does it mea n to you, learning that you are obese?\" Mr. R: \"My wife has been after me to lose weight and to g o on a diet.\" Summary: 1. Much of Assess ha s already occurred at other visits as you know his health history. 2. Mr. R has completed the REAP bef ore your meet with him. 3. Ask permission to discuss his weight. If he says no, ask why, and when it would be OK to discuss. 4. Provide a diagnosis, as most obese people don't acknowledge that they are obese. 5. Provide a rationale such as \"most Americans are gaining ...\" to normalize. ADVISE, Activity Doc: \"Of course, I'd advise you to be more active, and reduce your calories, too. However, I wonder if you could f ind any reasons that might be worth to make changes yourself. For example, your pattern of weight gain, higher blood pressure, blood sugar, a nd cholesterol may result in heart disease or diabetes over the next 5 to 10 years. What are your thoughts about this?\" Mr. R: \"I don't like the sound of having diabetes, or a heart attack.\" Doc: \"It is ha rd to think about yourself having diabetes, or heart disease.\" Mr. R: \"I' ve never really had any illnesses before. That would be a hard way to start.\" Summary: 1. Be clear about the risks of obesity, and personalize this to his risk profile if possible. 2. Elicit his perspective, and ref lect what you hear the patient say. Sidebar: If the patient has a healthy BMI (see http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/hea lth/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmicalc.htm ) that is stable, and is otherwise healthy, your advise statement could be something like this \"Based on what we have discussed, and your health history, I f eel your health would be best mainta ined if you ate healthier foods and were physically a ctive for 30 minutes of walking a day. B y 'healthier' I mean you would be less likely to get diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers if you choose better qua lity foods and were physica lly active each day. I'd like to work with you on this if you are willing.\" Ask if the patient understands your recommendation, and for his perspective a bout what you have said. Answer a ny questions. B e prepared to acknowledge that this represents a big change. AGREE Doc: \"You can avoid these, but it is a reasonably difficult change. It takes at least 6 to 8 weeks to find out if you can really learn to live in a new pattern. How motiva ted are you on a scale of 1 to 10 to wa lk for 60 minutes a day, while you reduce your ca lories?\" Mr. R: \"About 4.\" Doc: \"Tell me, from being an 8\" Mr. R: \"I just don't have that kind of time in my day.\" Doc: \"What keeps you from being a 2 in motivation?\" Mr. R: \"Well, I really would feel better about myself if I could lose about 30 pounds.\" Doc: \"Would you be willing to try for 5 to 10 pounds, first? Or, how about just trying to keep your weig ht neutral? There is a great deal of health you get from a 10 pound weight loss, or not gaining more weig ht, particula rly if you become more physically active.\" Mr. R: \"Oka y, I'd like to lose 10 pounds. What do I have to do?\" Summary: 1. After presenting the diagnosis of obesity a nd risk information, provide hope by indica ting that the patient can be successf ul at changing the cause-\u00adenergy imbalance. Acknowledge that it's difficult to make these changes over the long term. 2. Use the motivationa l assessment of asking how motivated the patient is to esta blish a new lifestyle. Then, explore the barriers by asking: Why aren't you higher than the number given? Write these in his cha rt so you can use these barriers to brain storm about these expected problems later. Now, move to agreement by asking: Why aren't you lower than the number given? Patient is likely to answer with a persona l (or autonomous) reason for change. If the answer isn't about him, ask again \"are there any other reasons that keep you from being less motivated?\"3. Negotiate a reasonable goal. Most patients want to lose lots of weight right away. This is likely to be frustrating to them later when most can' t maintain it. Suggest establishing new physical activity patterns or that just remaining weight neutral will be a success. This will help at future visits. ASSIST, Variety & Excess Doc: \"I want you to try three thing s; be more physica lly active; reduce you r calories by 25%; and, eat healthier f oods. We will g o over each of these briefly, but first I would suggest you choose a date to start in the next two weeks, if possible. What date makes sense to you?\" Mr. R: \"Next Saturday.\" Doc: \"Tell others around you that you are making these changes and ask f or their support. Anticipate where you will have difficulties and pla n around those.\" Mr. R: \"I' ll tell my wife, she will be thrilled. I'll ask her to go to the gym with me and to help change our diet. How much time do I have to exercise?\" Doc: \"I feel the physical activity is the most important part for your health. I want you to do whatever you can to start a new pattern of daily physical activity that you can continue. I suggest 15 minutes a day of walking at 3-\u00ad4 miles per hour for the first week, then increasing to 30 minutes a day in the second week. Further increa ses will depend on your weight g oals. Do you think you can make room for this daily physical activity?\" Mr. R: \"That will be a stretch, but I think I can do that by taking a walk af ter dinner.\" Doc: \"Here are some genera l guidelines about physical activity tha t you can use to guide how much you do in the long run. 30 minutes a day of wal king provides a lot of health by protecting you from diabetes, heart disease and colon cancer. The problem is you will likely still gain weight. 60 minutes of walking at 3-\u00ad4 miles per hour will keep you very healthy and your weig ht neutral. Here' s the bad news, it takes 90 minutes a day of walking to lose weight for most Americans.\"Mr. R: \"I can't believe it takes so much time to lose weight. There is no way I ca n do that with my schedule. Does it have to be all at one time?\" Doc: \"It does sound like a lot, but that's because the portions we eat are wa y too large. No, you don't have to do the physical activity all at once. You could do six 10 minute walks to keep your weig ht neutral. Every a dditional step improves your health, a nd burns calories, but it takes 20 steps to burn a calorie, that's about an hour of walking to burn off one candy bar with 250 calories.\" Mr. R: SILENCEDoc: \"It seems daunting, doesn't it-\u00addo what you can just walking over the next 8 weeks. Perhaps you won't be able to make any change.\" Mr. R: \"Well, I feel I need to do something about this sooner or later, lets try now.\" Doc: \"Build up gradually adding 10 or 15 minutes of walking per day each week to get to your goal. If you want to exercise harder than that, it ta kes time, but I would like you to get a stress test first before you exercise vigorously. Then, I' d like to see you back and discuss what went well and where it didn't. Try not to be hard on yourself. Wha t would be a reasona ble physical activity goal f or you?\" Mr. R: \"I' ll try to get to 20 to 25 minutes per day and see what happens.\" Summary o f physical activit y assist: 1. Support any patient willingness to start being more active. B e positive about any commitment to change, and tha t you feel the patient can do this. 2. If he is not ready to change, ask what would make it importa nt enough f or him to cha nge. Let him know you will bring it up again. B e positive, attentive and empathic. 3. Outline the three levels of activity a nd their relation to weight and health, either at this first visit or at the second. Be positive, acknowledge his reaction to this information. 4. Negotiate a date for the change to start. ASSIST, Reduce Calo ries Doc: \"That would be a grea t start. The second thing I'd like you to do is to learn to read food labels, so that you know what and how much you are eating. I have an example label here for you. The most important things on the label are to understand portion sizes so you can reduce your ca lories and to avoid all trans fat-\u00adif possible-\u00ad because they cause heart disease. Trans fats now appea r on all f ood labels in the U.S. In order to complete the next two parts of the discussion on reducing portion size and eating healthier food, first review the following inf ormation: 1. Determine Pat ient's Daily Calo ric Needs To quickly estima te the patient' s daily caloric needs you will need to know the patient's age, gender, and whether they are sedentary, modera tely active, or active. 2. Understanding and Co ntrolling Portion Sizes In order to reduce caloric intake successfully, your patient needs to know how to read a food label and how to estimate a serving size. 3. Behavioral Strat egies fo r Weight Lo ss Record your weight frequently, keep a f ood diary, monitor your daily physica l activity pattern 4. Set specific goals Set specif ic goa ls with your patients for the various f ood groups. B e sure to set realistic expectations. Determine Pat ient's Daily Calo ric Needs To quickly estima te the patient's daily caloric needs you will need to know the patient's age, gender, and whether they are sedentary, modera tely active, or active. Derive aylor' s Web-\u00adpage https://www.bcm.edu/research/centers/childrens-\u00ad nutrition-\u00adresearch-\u00adcenter/caloriesneed.cfm might (interactive menu-\u00ad planner) also helpf ul. A third resource for deriving a patient's caloric needs and f at intake is http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/GettingHealthy/FatsAndOils/Fats101/My-\u00adFa ts-\u00ad Translator_UCM_428869_Article.jsp (27). Af ter you enter your pa tient's, height, weight, age, gender, and physical activity level, the resource calculates caloric need, as well as recommended range for total f ats and limits for saturated fats a nd trans f ats. Walking is a helpful mea sure of physical activity (PA). See Table 4 on the Web-\u00adPage of the US Department of Health and Human Services about D ietary Guidelines http://www.health.gov /DietaryGuidelines/dga2005/document/html/cha pter3.htm for inf ormation about caloric per physical activity. Understanding and Co ntrolling Po rtion Sizes In order to reduce caloric intake successfully, your patient needs to know how to read a food label and how to estimate a serving size. Ask your patients to look over a sample food label and whether they f eel comf ortable understanding it. Ask patients if they can identify one or two of the followi ng serving sizes based on everyday objects. Some basic strategies f rom Blackburn a nd Waltma n (16) include reviewing how to read a food label, and teaching the patient in the Assist Step to identify a portion size by comparing it to everyday objects he or she is familiar with. Additional strategies to reduce portion size include: Leaving 25% of one's meal behind Taking 20 minutes or more to eat each meal Using a smaller dinner plate, and not letting foods touch each other on the plate Starting meals with appetizers of low energy density, such as salads and broth based soups Eating breakf ast daily Adding fiber to breakfa st Learning skills f or managing portions when eating restaurant foodsBehavioral St rategies fo r Weight Loss Record your weight frequently -\u00ad Keep a food diary -\u00ad Monitor your daily physica l activity pattern A recent study by Wing and Hill (28) f ound that patients who maintained weight loss of 30 lbs or more for a yea r engaged in very specif ic behaviors: weighing themselves weekly, eating breakf ast daily, and being regularly physically active. Several recent studies have shown that daily self -\u00ad weighing by participants was strongly associated with successful weight-\u00adloss maintenance and clinica l guidelines from the National Hea rt, Lung, and Blood Institute emphasize the importa nce of regular self-\u00admonitoring f or long-\u00adterm maintenance (29). Those who choose to eat healthier and get regular physica l activity will need additional skills: To learn what a calorie is. To learn to read f ood labels. To learn to avoid trans f ats. To learn about portion distortion, and how to gauge a serving size in terms of recognizable, everyday items such as a tennis ball or a deck of ca rds. Suggest the patient review the \"portion distortion\" website to learn more about this (http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/wecan/eat-\u00adright/portion-\u00addistortion.htm ). To learn the physical activity needed to burn certain amount of calories (e.g., that it takes a 150 lb person about an hour of walking a t 3.5 miles per hour to burn 250 calories-\u00ad or the amount of calories in a candy bar). To learn about why they overeat and to find replacement activities that are healthy. Set specific goals Set specif ic goa ls with your patients for the various f ood groups. B e sure to set realistic expectations. The thrust of your recommendations is to have them move a way from the typical American diet which is high in red meat, saturated fats, and ref ined flours to one tha t is rich in fruits, vegetable s, whole grains, lean meats and low fat dairy products. If they can't agree in principle to the overall direction of change, it is best to know that now. Review the REAP questionnaire with your patients. If agreeable, introduce each of these goa ls and ask if your patient is willing to make some change toward one or more of these goals working with you or with a nutritionist. Choose qua lity foods: 1. Half of your intake of grains should be whole gra ins (e.g., 3 slices of whole grain bread) 2. Have 5 to 9 servings of fruits a nd vegetables (4.5 cups for 2,000 calorie diet) 3. Keep total f at between 20 and 35% of total calories, with most f ats coming from fa ts such as fish, nuts, and vegetable oils; limit saturated fats, trans-\u00adfats, and cholesterol. 4. 3 cups per day of fat-\u00adfree or low-\u00adf at milk or equivalent. 5. Consume less than 2,300 mg of salt (one level teaspoon) per day. Include potassium rich food. 6. Keep alcohol to no more than 1 drink per day f or women and 2 per day f or men. Be physically active (e.g., walking at 3-\u00ad4 miles per hour) f or 30 minutes per day.ASSIST: Dialogue. We return to the interview between Mr. R. and his clinicia n.

Your strategies will focus on supporting motivation, assisting in skills building and assisting in getting additiona l support. First, support motivation. As a clinician, you ca n be an important motivator of nutrition and physical activity cha nge. B egin with a collaborative discussion that includes eva luation of nutriti onal intake and physical activity. Be positive that your patient can cha nge. On return visits, be attentive, respond to affect and remain empathic; if your patient has not been successf ul, acknowledge any frustration and remain non-\u00adjudgmental. Identify any short term successes and indicate that most people need to try more than once to succeed. Suggest tha t your patient choose a specific date in the n ext 2 weeks to renew change efforts, and remind that you will continue to help. Next, assist in skills building and problem solving. Spend the time to introduce to every willing patient the basic concepts of calories, reading food labels, serving size, and the health benef its expected from living in energy balance that includes 30 minutes of daily physica l activity. Patients with medical problems requi ring specific nutritional changes (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus) should be directed to a more specialized diet (e.g. DASH for hypertension) and to a dietician. Finally, assist in getting additional support. Ask your patient to bring important others to your visits, and advise your patient to discuss plans and ideas with friends, family and co-\u00adworkers, and seek their support to make changes. RELEVANT BEHAVIORS Emphasize energy balance (nutrition and physica l activity) when counseling. Assess nutritiona l intake and physical activity f or all patients (Consider WAVE. and REAP). Explore the patient's perspective before and af ter making clear recommendations for change. Support your patient's initiation of any positive change he or she a grees to make. Avoid increasing resistance (examples: never argue; acknowledge that making no change is an option; never speak arrogantly.) Recommend 30 minutes of physical activity per day f or all patients. Recommend 5 to 9 servings of f ruits and vegetables for all patients. Refer patients with multiple dietary change needs and with specif ic medical problems to a dietician (in addition to your own counseling.) Recommend the D ASH diet for those with hypertension or pre-\u00adhypertension. Express your certainty that your patient can succeed in making these changes. Arrange for follow-\u00adup in a reasonable time (1-\u00ad8 weeks). REFERENCES 1. Mokda d AH, Marks JS, Stroup D S, et. al. Actua l causes of death in the United States, 2000.

Ratio nale Steven Locke, MD Video is loading... The Patient's View Video is loading... The Do ctor's View Steven Locke, MD Questio ns fo r Reflect ion: 1. What are non-\u00adverbal clues, including your own subjective responses to the patient, that indicate the patient is anxious? 2. What concerns do you have a bout shifting your interview to allow f or exploration of the patient's past history of treatment f or mental disorders? 3. What kinds of situations make you anxious? How might your own experiences with anxiety lead you to a greater understanding of patients with anxiety? 4. How do (or might you) feel when patients ca nnot be reassured tha t their physical symptoms are likely due to an anxiety disorder? 5. How might these feelings af fect your communication with your patient? Key Principles: 1. Patients with anxiety disorders are more likely to present with physica l symptoms than to compla in that they feel a nxious. Take a ll somatic concerns seriously. Any attempt to dismiss their relevance will increa se patients' anxiety. Anxiety can be \"ca tching,\" so be careful toapproach anxious patients in a calm and reassuring manner. 2. Patients will be reassured that you are taking them seriously when you explore their somatic symptoms carefully, even when you think the symptoms are likely to be physical manifestations of anxiety. 3. After exploring somatic symptoms, tra nsition gently to inquiring about current worries, concerns and recent stressors. Ask whether the patient has previously had similar symptoms, a nd/ or trea tment for an anxiety disorder or a mood disorder. 4. In addition, take a thorough history to discover whether the anxiety could be a sign of 1. an underlying medical disorder (e.g., hyperthyroidism), 2. an adverse drug effect (e.g., SSRIs, psychostimulants, respira tory medications such as theophylline, and steroids), 3. toxic effects of ca ffeine or alcohol, 4. an agita ted withdrawal state due to alcohol or drug discontinuation, or 5. an undia gnosed depressive disorder that is presenting with anxiety. 6. an underlying history of trauma: rape, incest, sexual a buse, or exposure to violence 5. Because a nxiety disorders can be f amilial, it is important to also explore the occurrence of similar symptoms in biological relatives and inquire if there is any family history of phobias, obsessive-\u00adcompulsive behavior, panic attacks, agoraphobia, social a nxiety or shyness. A family history of alcoholism or substance a buse is often a marker f or underlying anxiety or mood disorders that may be f amilial. 6. In addition, anxiety disorders are often \"co-\u00admorbid,\" and co-\u00adoccur with other mental disorders such as depression, post-\u00adtra umatic stress disorder, and/or substance abuse. Look carefully for these diagnoses a s well. Tip: A paper-\u00adand-\u00adpencil self-\u00adreport symptom checklist or computer-\u00adassisted assessment tool can be very helpf ul in ensuring a more thorough evaluation than is otherwise possible in primary care or general medical settings. Learning go als: At the co nclusion o f this mo dule, yo u will be able to : describe the key features of anxiety as it appears in its most common forms in the prima ry care setting; list common somatic symptoms tha t lead anxious patients to seek treatment in the general medical setting; list medical conditions that can masquerade as an anxiety disorder; elicit a nxious patients' symptoms a nd perspectives; assess the patient for comorbid conditions (behavioral and somatic); inform patients how mind-\u00adbody interactions produce somatic symptoms; inform patients about treatment options, and explore their interest in treatmentINTRODUCTION Despite a high prevalence of a nxiety disorders, clinicians frequently miss this diagnosis. They fail to explore patients' current worries, concerns and recent stressors, and do not ask whether the patient has previously had similar symptoms, and/ or treatment for an anxiety disorder or a mood disorder. Instead, clinicia ns focus on \"ruling out\" an exhaustive list of illnesses that \"might\" produce the patients' somatic symptoms, of ten ordering unproductive expensive studies. Anxiety disorders are serious medical illnesses that cause disabling anxiety and fear. Unlike episodic anxiety caused by a stressful event such as a business presentation or a first date, anxiety disorders are relentlessly distressing, disrupting patients' lives with irrational f ear and dread. Eff ective treatments ar e available, and resea rch is yielding improved therapies that can help most people with anxiety disorders lead fulfilling lives. Anxiety disorders include panic disorder, obsessive-\u00adcompulsive disorder, post-\u00adtrauma tic stress disorder (PTSD ), generalized anxiety disorder, and phobia s (social phobia, agoraphobia, and specif ic phobia). Iin a given year, approximately 40 million Americans, about 18 percent of adults over 18 have an anxiety disorder. Almo st 75% of patients with an anxiety-\u00addisorder have their f irst episode by age 22. Anxiety disorders frequently co-\u00adoccur with depressive disorders or substance abuse. 1. Kessler RC, Chiu WT, Demler O, Walters EE. Prevalence, severity, a nd comorbidity of twelve-\u00ad month DSM-\u00adIV disorders in the Survey Replication (NCS-\u00adR). Arch Genera l Psychiat 2005;62(6):617-\u00ad27. Anxiety disorders are common in primary care, with preva lence about 15%. Primary care pa tients usually hav e relatively mild symptoms, and the anxiety disorder is often co-\u00admorbid with depression, substance a buse, or somatiza tion. (2) Each anxiety disorder carries distinct features, but the common theme of excessive, irrational f ear and dread binds them together. Most common, and most confusing to distinguish f rom medical disorders tha t produce symptoms of anxiety are genera lized anxiety disorder and panic disorder. Currently, growing numbers of vetera ns from combat theaters of operation are re-\u00adentering civilian life; the appearance in prima ry care settings of patients with symptoms of PTSD requires a heightened alertness and proper dia gnosis and treatment. Primary care clinicians less often encounter obsessive-\u00adcompulsive disorder, social phobia (or social anxiety disorder), a nd other specif ic phobias. In this module we will focus on the more common Generalized Anxiety and Panic Disorders. First, though, we will review the basic approa ch to anxiety in medical patients. Physical o r emot ional? Anxiety disorders are quintessential \"mind-\u00adbody\" disorders that mock medicine's outdated view of the mind and body as separate entities. Distressing physical symptoms usually lead people with anxiety disorders to primary care clinicians. Particularly if symptoms such as dizziness, shortness of breath, palpita tions, muscle tension, or sleep difficulties are worsening or recurrent, they mislead patients and their clinicia ns. In the frequent fruitless sea rch for a \"physica l\" disorder, clinicians overuse tests and procedures.In the absence of skilled explana tions, the unnecessary expense and negative results make patients more anxious and dissa tisfied, and they worry that their frustrated doctors are thinking \"the problems are all in your head.\" Of course, nothing could be f urther from the truth. The complex pathophysiology involves the brain and peripheral nervous system, the autonomic nervous system a nd both central and peripheral elements of the neuro-\u00adpsycho-\u00adendocrine system. This module enables you to discern when common physica l symptoms belong to a medical condition that is masquerading as an anxiety disorder, a nd far more commonly, to discern when to provide specific trea tment for the anxiety disorder in which distressing and disabling physical symptoms suggest an occult medical disorder. A principal therapeutic tool for anxiety disorder management is your skillful conversation that informs and encou rages patients, that is not defensive about testing (or NOT testing! ), that responds to patients' perspectives, and that consistently shows your empathy and positive regard f or patients. Who should be assessed fo r anxiety? Clinicians ca n address the dilemma caused by the disparity between the high preva lance of anxiety disorder and infrequent diagnosis by systematically employing siimple and validated screening tools. Anxiety disorders are so prevalent in primary care settings and so frequently undiagnosed that we recommend regular anxiety screening for every patient. This screening may occur annually during a well patient visit. it should also happen at any time a patient presents with physical symptoms that are not attributable to an obvious acute physical disorder. Particularly important are the following symptoms: sweating, shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, syncope, choking sensations, flushes, paresthesias, a nd even chest pain (especially in a young person with no risk factors for cardiac disease). Many patients who are at a high risk of anxiety have other problems that divert attention a nd result in continued and increased suff ering because of the untreated anxiety. Important groups include patients with chronic illnesses such as diabetes, heart failure, CAD, patients with unexplained somatic symptoms such a s pain, f atigue, or neurological symptoms, and patients under stress because of major life transitions such as job loss or caring f or a sick family member, or those with a recent exacerbation of a serious illness. If you become concerned about an anxiety disorder during an acute care visit, use a brief standardized assessment tool to help you decide whether to follow up with a more detailed exporation. Screening fo r Anxiety Diso rders Anxiety disorder screening can be done with either self-\u00adreport or clinician administered screening tools, a nd each has its advantages. When concern about an anxiety disorder surfaces during an interview, use a brief standardized assessmen t tool to help decide whether to proceed with further diagnostic explorations. Patients accept the easily completed and accurate brief self -\u00adreport assessment tools currently available, and we recommend that clinicia ns use them. One example is the GAD-\u00ad7, which is discussed in detail in \"Elicit Symptoms\" section under \"APPROACH\", below. It asks about the 7 cardinal f eatures of Genera lized Anxiety Disorder (GAD ), and has high sensitivity and specif icity forGAD. It is less sensitive, but f airly specif ic for Panic D isorder, Social Anxiety Disorder and PTSD . (11) Pencil and pa per versions are being replaced by versions f or computer, telephone (interactive voice response systems IVR), on-\u00adline or smartphone usage.Clinician-\u00adadministered tools require valuable time that is better used for dialogue with patients about the mea ning of symptoms a nd for providing information about diagnostic and treatment options. WHEN A PATIENT IS ANXIOUS When a patient shows nervousness, whether verbally or non-\u00adverbally, or when a patient has multiple somatic symptoms not obviously connected to a medical problem, seek more information so that you can establish or reject the diagnosis of an anxiety disorder. Take a careful history, listening for anxiety related to known diseases, a nd for possible medical conditions that can lead to anxiety. Gather information about medicati ons, including herbals and OTC meds, and attend carefully to the psychosocial history. Ask about \"stress\" and listen actively, getting details of the stressf ul situa tion, the timefra me, and the patient's emotiona l reactions. Ask about substance use and abuse, depressive symptoms, a nd past history of anxiety and pa nic attacks. Check for family history of mental disorders, including substance use disorde rs. There is a high rate of heritability a nd comorbidity of a nxiety and mood disorders(6). Anxiet y in medically ill pat ients People who a re medically ill often exhibit anxiety. Some of the numerous psychological rea sons for this response include the following: (3) Uncertainty regarding the medical diagnosis and / or the prognosis Concern about one's body (loss of f unction, disfigurement) Fear of pain or suffering Fear of death Fear of dependence Fear of abandonment Concern about the impact of illness on identity and livelihood Concern about the impact of the illness on relationships (family, friends, coworkers) Concern about interacting with stra ngers or being in the hospital Concern regarding negative reactions from clinicia nsCo-\u00admorbid Depressio n Depression often accompanies anxiety disorders (4) and, when it does, it needs to be treated as well. Nearly half of patients with anxiety disorders also have major depression, and nearly half of patients with depression have an anxiety disorder. Symptoms of depression include f eelings of sadness, hopelessness, changes in appetite or sleep, low energy, and dif ficulty concentra ting (M 27). Most people with depression can be eff ectively treated with antidepressant medications, certain types of psychotherapy, or a combination of both. Respo nding to anxio us mo od Rely on basic ra pport-\u00adbuilding skills to respond to a patient's anxious mood. Five basic skills have been discussed in Module 6: ref lection, legitimation, support, partnership, and respect. When a patient appea rs anxiou s, it is usually helpful to make a brief reflective comment, e.g., \"You seem quite [tense][restless][nervous][anxious][upset]\" (select a descriptive word that seems to reflect the patient's experience). If the patient seems perplexed by your reflective comment, mention what you observed that led you to make the ref lective statement. For example, you might say: \"Well, you're fidgeting and restless and s eem to be having a hard time concentrating on what we're discussing. Is there something that' s distracting you? Can you tell me about it?\" A simpler approach might be: \"I can see this is upsetting for you to talk about.\" Usually this type of comment is helpful, but not always. Some patients with anxiety also suff er from shame sensitivity and may f eel criticized or even humiliated by the clinicia n commen ting on their obvious anxiety. In this instance, you will need to defuse the stigma tizing power of the observation by mentioning how common these symptoms are (\"legitimize\" the patient's situation) and tha t by recognizing them early, ef fective treatment can be started. Empathic comments a bout the observed symptoms serve many purposes - they let the patient know you are listening and observing. This giv es the patient \"permission\" to talk about the feelings. And it communicates a sense of support to the patient. When you listen a nd respond empathica lly, sometimes the anxious patient will allow more of the associated sa dness to emerge after hearing this type of facilitative comment. The patient' s eyes may even tear up or he/she may start to cry. EVERYDAY ANXIETY DIFFERS FROM ANXIETY DISORDERS Patients w ith Genera lized Anxiety Disorder (GAD ) have \"free-\u00adfloating\" a nxiety, chara cterized by an over-\u00adreactive nervous system whose reactions produce physical symptoms.If someone pointed a gun at you, it's likely that you would become anxious. Your heart would beat faster and could pound, your palms would become swea ty, breathing would become rapid and shallow, your mouth would become dry, and intestina l motility would decrease.* That is adaptive anxiety and a component of the \"flight or fight\" response described by Cannon. But what if merely pointing a pencil at you produced the same full set of responses? That inappropriate response would be an indica tion of the presence of an anxiety disorder - an over reactive nervous system easily triggered by otherwise neutral stimuli. Some people with those chara cteristics suffer from repeated and frequent elicitation of the f light or fight response and live with a chronic state of \"free-\u00adfloating\" a nxiety. Constant over-\u00adrea ctivity to everyday worries and concerns can lead to persistent physica l and emotional symptoms of distress, a nd produce the condition known as \"generalized anxiety disorder\" or, GAD. *Although sympathetic activation decrea ses colon activity, the colon has increased motility in panic attacks, which may be attributable to CRF. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16046376?dopt=Abstract DSM IV Diagno stic criteria for generalized anxiety disorders A.

Note: Only one item is required in children. restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge being easily f atigued difficulty concentra ting or mind going blank irritability muscle tension sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep) D. The fo cus of the anxiety and worry is not confined to features o f an Axis I disorder, e.g., the anxiety or worry is not about having a Panic A ttack (as in a Panic Disorder), being embarrassed in public (as in Social Phobia), being contaminated (as in Obsessive-\u00adCompulsive Disorder), being away f rom home or close relatives (as in Separation Anxiety Disorder), gaining weight (as in Anorexia Nervosa), having multiple physical compla ints (as in Somatization D isorder), or having a serious illness (as in Hypochondriasis), and the anxiety and worry do not occur exclusively during Posttrauma tic Stress D isorder. E. The anxiety, wo rry, o r physical sympto ms cause clinically significant dist ress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of f unctioning. F. The disturbance is no t due to the direct physio logical effects o f a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism) a nd does not occur exclusively during a Mood D isorder, a Psychotic Disorder, or a Pervasive Developmental D isorder. AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text)Panic Attacks Panic attacks are feelings of terror that strike suddenly and repeatedly with no warning. People who have panic attacks can't predict when an attack will occur and one result is that people develop intense a nxiety between episodes, worrying when a nd where the next one will strike. When repeated pa nic attacks lead to persistent or recurrent worry about f uture attacks, the condition is known as panic disorder. If you are having a panic a ttack, most likely your heart will pound and you may f eel sweaty, wea k, faint, or dizzy. Your hands may tingle or feel numb, and you might feel flushed or chilled. You may have nausea, chest pain or smothering sensations, a sense of unreality, or fear of impending doom or loss of control. You may genuinely believe you' re having a heart attack or losing your mind, or on the verge of death. Panic attacks can occur at any time, even during sleep. An attack generally peaks within 10 minutes, but some symptoms may last much longer. Lif etime prevalence estimates are almost 1 out of 4 persons for isolated panic attacks (without agoraphobia ) and almost 1% f or panic attacks with agoraphobia but without panic disorder (4). Panic disorder Panic D isorder is common, disablin g and treatable. Suicide is a tragic outcome. Panic D isorder is frequently co-\u00admorbid with depression, substance abuse or alcoholism. Panic disorder is a painful condition and associated with suicide, especially when a ccompanied by depression. This is especially tragic because the illness is one of the most treatable of the anxiety disorders, and very responsivel to medications or ta rgeted psychothera py. Some people with panic disorder go for years without lea rning that they have a treatable illness. Ma ny people with panic disorder visit an emergency room repeatedly or see a number of doctors before they obtain a correct diagnosis. Panic disorder affects about 6 million adult Americans (1), about twice as many women as men (5), and in any given year about 2.7 percent of people over age 18 have panic disorder. Lifetime prevalence f or panic disorder is a lmost 4% without a goraphobia, and just over 1% f or panic disorder with agoraphobia (4). Panic disorder often begins during late adolescence or early adulthood (5), a nd the risk of developing panic disorder appears heritable (6). Not everyone who experiences panic attacks will develop panic disorder\u2014for exa mple, many people have one a ttack but neve r have another. Treatment for panic disorder is effective, but patients with untreated panic disorder can become very disabled and develop a secondary depression. Panic disorder is frequently comorbid with major depression, and when they occur together the depression treatment is more dif ficult and outcomes are poorer. In addition to being frequently co-\u00admorbid with depression, panic disorder is often accompanied by other serious conditions such as drug abuse or a lcoholism (7,8). Video is loading... Steven Locke, MD , is the Clinician in this video Agorapho bia When people with recurrent panic atta cks become unable to carry out everday a ctivities, their illness is called agoraphobia. Recurrent panic attacks lead people to avoid places or situations where panic atta cks have occurred. For example, if a panic attack strikes while riding in an elevator, a person might develop a fear of elevators. If she begins to avoid elevators, that aff ects her choice of a job or apartment and restricts other parts of her life. Some lives become so restricted tha t people avoid everyda y activities such a s grocery shopping or driving, and some people become housebound. Others are able to confront a feared situation only if accompanied by a spouse or another trusted person. Basically, people try to avoid any situation in which they would feel helpless if a panic at tack were to occur. When their lives become very restricted, as happens in a bout one-\u00adthird of people with panic disorder (5) the condition is called agoraphobia. Early treatment of panic disorder can prevent agoraphobia. Screening questio ns fo r panic diso rder The first two questions have 94% sensitivity to detect panic disorder if either is positive. 1. In the past 6 mont hs, did yo u ever have a spell o r an att ack when all o f a sudden you felt frightened, anxio us or very uneasy? yes___ no___ 2. In the past 6 mont hs, did yo u ever have a spell o r attack when for no reason your heart suddenly began to race, yo u felt faint, o r you co uldn't cat ch yo ur breath? yes___ no___ IF YOU ANSWERED YES TO QUESTION #1 OR TO QUESTION #2, THEN CONTINUE WITH QUESTIONS 3-\u00ad5, OTHERWISE, STOP (0 = NO PANIC D ISORD ER). 3. Did any of these spells o r attacks ever happen in a sit uation when you were not in danger or not the cent er of at tentio n? yes___ no___ 4.

Psychosom Med 1999;61:359-\u00ad364. (9)CONDUCT A FULL ASSESSMENT Full assessment o f patient s with anxiet y includes 3 fundament al steps. First, build enough trust and relationship with patients so that they are willing to disclose their symptoms, while asking the screening and follow-\u00adup questions discussed above; Second, differentiate these symptoms from a general medical condition or adverse drug effect; And third, help patients to understand how anxiety can be the basis f or their persistent or recurrent physical / somatic symptoms. Facilitat e ackno wledgement and disclo sure o f anxiety sympt oms When you discover any symptoms of a nxiety, continue with an open question, a nd move to inquiry about the 7 cardinal symptoms of Genera lized Anxiety D isorder. If patients show verbal or non-\u00adverbal signs of anxi ety, you might make a reflective comment as a way of beginning your data gathering in a n open-\u00adended way. For exa mple, \"You seem worried (or nervous, or anxious.)\" If the patient acknowledges a nxiety and worry, ask them to tell you a little more, and then proceed with inquiry about specific symptoms related to GAD and Panic D isorder, as discussed in prior sections. The GAD -\u00ad7 (below) is a screening quest ionnaire that you can use as a starting point for inquiry, filling it out while in dialogue with patients, or having them complete it in the waiting area . It includes the 7 cardinal symptoms of GAD. The GAD -\u00ad7 has been extensively valida ted for use in medical and surgical off ice practice. It was designed primarily as a screening a nd severity measure for generalized anxiety disorder, but the GAD -\u00ad7 also has modera tely good opera ting characteristics for three other common a nxiety disorders - panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and post-\u00ad traumatic stress disorder. GAD -\u00ad7 total score for the seven items ranges from 0 to 21, and a score of 10 or grea ter is the recommended cutpoint for further evaluation. (10). There a re seven cardinal symptoms of GAD, here shown in the GAD -\u00ad7 format: Over the last 2 we eks, how o ften have yo u been bothered by t he fo llowing pro blems?not at allsev-\u00ad eraldaysmorethan half the daysnearlyeveryday Feeling nervous, anxious or on edge 0 1 2 3 Not being able to stop or control worrying 0 1 2 3 Worrying too much about different things 0 1 2 3 Trouble relaxing 0 1 2 3 Being so restless that it is hard to sit still 0 1 2 3 Becoming easily annoyed or irritable 0 1 2 3 Feeling af raid as if something awful might happen 0 1 2 3 At a cutpoint of 10, the following sensitivity a nd specificities have been reported f or four common types of anxiety: GAD = 10 PTSD Sensit ivity .89 .74 .72 .66 Specificity .82 .81 .80 .81 This mea ns that when using the GAD-\u00ad7 for screening, 89% of patients with GAD will score 10 or more (true positives), a nd 82% of patients without GAD will score less than 10 (true negatives). 11% with a score of 10 will NOT have GAD (false positives) and 18% with a score less than 10 WILL have GAD , the false negatives.) In addition, because almost half of patients with a n anxiety disorder also have a depressive disorder, it is usef ul to screen the patient for depression as well. This can be done by asking \"Have you been feeling sa d, blue, down in the dumps?\" \"Have you noticed t hat you don't enjoy thing s as much as you used to?\" If the patient responds positively to either one of the two above questions, you should proceed further with an open-\u00adended question, such as: \"Could you tell me a little more about your f eelings of sa dness or your loss of enjoyment?\" If depression is suspected, initiate a more thorough assessment for depression, as outlined in Module 27, or use a valid ated screening questionaire such as the PHQ-\u00ad9. Differentiate anxiety diso rders fro m medical conditio ns and drug effects Many treatable medical conditions and a long list of medications cause a nxiety. B e mindful of this criticall issue in order to help patients avoid unnecessary suffering. Many treatable medical disorders produce obvious a nd sometimes dramatic anxiety symptoms and findings. Too often, c linicians make a psychiatric diagnosis without conducting f urther inquiry, physical exam and diagnostic studies. Then the medical disorder such a s hyperthyoidism or a central nervous system illness goes untreated, sometimes with tragic results. When seeing patients with anxiety, be mindful of the likelihood that anxiety symptoms may be due to an underlying disease process. Ask questions and do the requisite physical exams that will help save patients from avoidable suf fering. A partial list of common problems mistaken f or anxiety disorders follows: Thyroid disease, particularly hyperthyroidism Pulmona ry disease Parkinson's disease Post-\u00adstroke anxiety Seizures Cognitive dysfunction (delirium, dementias) Alcoholism or drug addiction; either wi th withdrawal syndromes or without them Rare conditions, such as carcinoid or pheochromocytoma. A very long list of medications produce a nxiety as a side-\u00adeff ect, and two classes, the anti-\u00ad depressa nts and anxiolytics, are of special and paradoxical importance. Some antidepressant drugs approved by the FDA for the treat ment of anxiety disorders (e.g., certain SSRIs), can paradoxically cause anxiety. Occ asionally, this substance-\u00adinduced anxiety subsides as the person becomes adjusted to the medication. However, substance-\u00adinduced anxiety can become intolerable and this possibility must be considered during assessment a s well as during treatment. Other anxiolytic drugs that can para doxically cause anxiety symptoms are benzodia zepines (BZDPs), a class of drugs that is effective for both controlling anxie ty and inducing sleep, yet can also cause symptoms indistinguishable from a nxiety under specia l circumstances. When patients have been using BZDPs on a daily basis f or long periods of time or at high doses, a \"discontinuation syndrome\" may occur if they stop the medication suddenly. This ra pid cessation of a drug with sedative properties can lead to nervousness, agitation, swea ting, sleeplessness, a nd other signs of CNS over-\u00adactivation. In this case, urgent treatment is required, often including continuous medical supervision. A list of other common drug classes that cause anxiety(3) bo th sympto m discussio n and engagement wit h treat ment Minimize embarrassment a nd other obstacles to diagnosis and treatment with trust-\u00adbuilding statements and common-\u00adsense explanations. Anxiety is included in the general social stigma about mental illness or emotional problems. Consequently, patients may be embarrassed to disclose a nxiety or symptoms of panic or may simply deny their presence. The social stigma extends to patients without full-\u00adblown anxiety disorders, who may respond to simple inquiry such as, \"Are you anxious?\" with irritation, perhaps responding, \"Of course I'm worried, who wouldn' t be worried, with all these physica l problems and all the stress I am under.\" This minimization of symptoms and resistance to talking about them frustrates clinicia ns. As noted in Modules 6 and 13, arguing with patients or f alling back on authority, saying something like \"Well, I do think you're anxious even if you are not aware of it\" hinders f urther dialogue. Legitimation (normalization, validation), support and simple expla nations presented straightforwardly without jargon and without conveying an implication of authority or superiority help resistant patient s remain engaged. An example statement might sound like this (with suitable pauses f or patient response-\u00ad see Module 10): \"Many people in your shoes f eel exactly like you feel. The kind of problems and stresses you have been having would certainly be upsetting for almost everyone. ... Over the years I have learned that when people strugg le with these serious problems f or a long time, their body beg ins to run out of the chemicals that help all of us cope with stress. ... Loss of those chemical helpers can lead to an imba lance which makes it even harder to cope and function ef fectively. Everyone under enough stress f or long enough will have difficulty functioning at the level they usually can manage easily. ... In these high-\u00ad stress situations, certain medications and self-\u00admanagement tools can really help. ... What do you think?\" Unless the clinician employs trust-\u00adbuilding explana tions of the \"medical model\" of the illness process, patients may become confused, f rustra ted and completely deaf to any trea tment suggestions. Finding a response that not only reassures patients and suggests tha t you understand their perspective, but also encourages an alternative view of the situation enables continuation of the conversation. Patients may use a lcohol to self-\u00admedicate, but this culturally sanctioned practice is ultimately self-\u00ad defeating because alcohol quickly loses any ef fectiveness, a nd heavy use may result in the development of alcoholism. MANAGEMENT Follow the sequence below to provide good treatment for patients with anxiety. TELL THE PATIENT YOUR DIAGNOSISShare your thoughts about how the illness process works (your \"explanatory model,\" module 9) Address stigma and barrier health belief s Inform the pa tient about trea tment options and offer choices when that is appropriate Agree with the patient on a specif ic treatment plan (Module 11) and document the discussion and the patient's agreement (Module 17) Support the patient's self -\u00admanagement strategies. ONCE THE PATIENT BEGINS TREATMENT, THE SUB SEQUENT TASKS ARE THOSE OF ASSURING ADHERENCE AND MAKING ADJUSTMENTS DURING FOLLOW UP VISITS - (Module 16): Monitor symptoms Monitor adherence and address barriers Continue educa tion about a nxiety and about working together Elicit and address adverse events or concerns as they arise Reassess progress, adjust the treatment plan and agree on any changes to it Document the informed consent conversations so as to reflect changes in the plan Tell the diagnosis Patients often have difficulty understa nding mind-\u00adbody relationships and even more difficulty accepting tha t the symptoms rela te to a trea table a nxiety disorder Many patients with anxiety come to the of fice complaining of symptoms like dizziness, headaches, muscle tension, and insomnia. They seldom rela te these somatic symptoms to anxiety, so they are understandably disturbed when the doctor seems to \"explain away\" their symptoms by suggesting that anxiety causes them. In fact, clinicians can easily be caught in that trap of seeming to discount physical symptoms in their ef fort to inform and treat patients' a nxiety. A multidimensional approa ch assists in maintenance of a partnership with patients. On the one hand, treat the physical symptoms with respect, evaluate somatic concerns and treat them conservatively. Meanwhile, treat anxiety as an independent cause of suffering and disa bility. For example, a conversa tion with patients with irritable bowel syndrome and a clinica lly signif icant anxiety disorder might sound like the following example, which illustrates a multidimensional approach: \"I hear very clearly that your stoma ch pain and bloating is a big problem f or you. I am going to prescribe a new medication that should reduce your bloa ting and cramping, while we conduct a few simple tests. I also think that stress a nd anxiety a re worsening your symptoms, and that treatment f or the stress and anxiety will help us get your symptoms under much better control. If you are willing I' d like to talk about how we can treat the stress a nd anxiety, too.\" As you increase your understanding of mind-\u00adbody relationships, strive to develop communication skills that will enable you to effectively inform patients about the basis for symptoms using an explana tory model that integrates mind-\u00adbody mecha nisms. (module 9 &10)Address \"barrier\" health beliefs and denial Stigma about emotiona l problems is widespread and is both a cause and a result of health belief s that act as barriers to good information and treatment. Ask about belief s. The most important barrier health belief is the notion that mental disorders signif y personal weakness. This belief and ba rrier hinders development of a partnership and alliance between doctor and patient. Establishing the presence of a barrier health belief is neither difficult nor complex, but the clinician has to take the initiative to ASK about it. The doctor might say something like the f ollowing: \"I think stress and anxiety is contributing to your symptoms . ...What do you know about anxiety?... What does the term mean to you?... How do you feel about the diagnosis of an anxiety di sorder?\"... The patient's response(s) may uncover health belief s that can profoundly affect a working alliance, but also provide an opportunity to respond directly to barrier belief s and concerns. An alliance-\u00ad building response might sound something like the following: \"I understand how you might feel this way. Anyone exposed to enough stress will develop an anxiety disorder and it has very little to do with a person's strengths or weaknesses. You may have heard that fully a third of the soldiers returning f rom Ira q have serious emotional problems from the extreme stress they were exposed to. Even astronauts, who are carefully selected f or both physical conditioning and stress-\u00ad resistance, have occasionally experienced symptoms of anxiety a nd depression during long-\u00adduration space missions.\" Patients w ho state, \"I a m not anxious,\" or in other direct or indirect ways show that they do not accept your explanations or management strategies present a special dilemma . Denial of a nxiety or resistance to explanations and treatment is especially troublesome when a patient has self-\u00ad medicated with alcohol or other substances. Either beca use of fear, stigma or substance a buse, these patients are out of touch with their emotions, do not understand the mind-\u00adbody connection and often reject recommenda tions f or behavioral treatments in a dismissive f ashion. Sometimes the substance abuse issue must be addressed first (module 29 & 30). In some cases I have helped patients diminish their suff ering by saying, \"It seems that standard medical care has been a serious disappointment f or you. ... Relief may be in sigh t, however, as I know many patients with symptoms like yours who enjoyed considerable relief of their symptoms and their distress af ter they participated in a mind-\u00adbody educa tion progra m that teaches stress management.\" By removing the recommendation f rom the domain of mental health and ref raming it in terms of health educa tion, stigma may be avoided and adherence a chieved. Provide bio medical info rmation, alo ng with suppo rt As you tell the patient your idea about the diagnosis, you have the opportunity to explain the concepts of anxiety and panic. Education begins with an assessment of current knowledge: \"What is your understanding of anxiety?\"After responding to any verba l or non-\u00adverbal expression of concern with empathic statements, you can make concrete and clear statements about how modern medicine understands the condition. Explanations might include statements like the following (or parts of them), interspersed with opportunities for the patient to respond, and accompanied by relationship-\u00adbuilding statements from you. \"While everyone has occasional worries or fears, an a nxiety disorder is a different story. For a variety of reason s, such as genetic inheritance, age, and stress, the body and the brain are make too many stress hormones. Those chemica l hormones provoke the symptoms you describe. In some cases, they can lead to a terrible cycle of panic attacks. Unfortunately, the worry caused by the symptoms make the problem even worse. B ecause people cannot predict when those hormones and chemicals will be most active, they get worried that they will get worse, or that something else will happen. Then tha t worry makes more hormones a nd the concern comes true and people feel worse, and so on. ... \"The panic attack cycle set off by the chemica ls produce extreme symptoms, and help us understand. When someone has a panic attack, the chemica ls make her heart pound and she may feel sweaty, weak, f aint, or dizzy. Her hands may tingle or feel numb, and she might feel flushed or chilled. She may have nausea, chest pain or smothering sensations, a sense of unreality, or f ear of impending doom or loss of control. She may genuinely believe she is having a heart attack or losing her mind, or on the verge of death. The feelings of terror strike suddenly and repeatedly, with no wa rning, and for no good reason. B ecause she cannot predict when a terror f eeling will strike, she becomes very a nxious between episodes, worrying when and where the next one will happen, and then that worry makes more hormones and another attack gets set off. ... \"The good news, however, is that panic disorder and other anxiety problems caused by these chemica l hormones are easily treated and can usually be controlled. It's a physical condition and nothing to be emba rrassed over. Would you like to learn about the various treatment options?\" Personalized, interactive, online programs for the technology-\u00adsupported management of anxiety are available; expect more such programs to be available for wireless devices. Nego tiatio n of a treatment plan Many patients will accept treatment recommendations. B ecause of stigma or disbelief that mind and body are so inter twined, or both, others are reluctant to accept. Adopt an empathic and unpressured approach that communicates your interest in continuing partnership. The strategies of skillful explora tion of patient perspectives (M 9), thoughtful information-\u00adsharing (M10) and reaching agreement (M11) strengthen the alliance with patients and provide them with the best possible outcome at any given visit. A convers ation with a reluctant patient might proceed as described in the following paragraphs. \"You have an anxiety disorder that usually improves with treatment. Anxiety improves with proper medication. And anxiety also improves with counseling or psychotherapy. Some people prefer both medication a nd counseling, which is often the most ef fective path to f ollow. Some self-\u00admanagement a pproaches are effective for mild anxiety. Would you be interested in these treatments? Of course, I'll tell you my recommendations.\"Patients who a re reluctant or refuse trea tment at the time of first diagnosis may be open to some conservative self-\u00admanagement approaches such as exercise, meditation, and stress management. Many agree to more intensive treatment later. Always remain supportive of the patient, even when you believe they are making a poor choice, and leave the door open to future trea tment. Inviting signif icant others into the discussion ca n also be helpful. You might say something like the following: \"I understand that you are not interested to start treatment now. I hope you might think more a bout what I have said, perhaps talk to your husband (or wife, or parents, etc) and even bring him (or her or them) to your next appointment. I'd like to continue to work together, and see how you feel in say, two or three weeks? ... You might also want to try some self-\u00adhelp approaches during this time to see if they can ma ke a difference. Would you like me to provide some educa tional materials or direct you to online inf ormation tha t many patients have f ound to be useful?\" Personalized, interactive, online programs for the technology-\u00adsupported management of anxiety are available; expect more such progra ms to be a vailable for wireless devices. If the patient clearly is not ready to accept treatment, the tenor of the sta tements above amounts to \"watchful wa iting.\" You clearly state that you will not \"abandon\" the patient, and that you are prepa red to continue the conversation a t a later date. Self-\u00admanagement suppo rt (SMS) You can help your patient with chronic anxiety problems by helping the patient design and stick to a self-\u00admanagement plan. The \"5 A's\" provide a useful organizing framework f or assisting the patie nt. Anxiety is a chronic, recurring illness. Sometimes it is a life-\u00adlong problem. Like patients with other chronic illnesses such as diabetes and heart f ailure, patients with anxiety who come to accept responsibility f or self -\u00admana gement have better quality of life and the best long-\u00adterm outcomes. You can help your patient with chronic anxiety by supporting the patient's self -\u00admana gement. One model for guiding self-\u00admanagement is known as \"the 5 A's of Self -\u00adManagement Support\", based upon the work of Lorig, and others. The 5 A' s are discussed in M 16 and M 24. Here we offer examples of how the 5As could be used for patients with anxiety disorders. Assess On follow-\u00adup visits, patients with ongoing a nxiety symptoms may not have addressed contributory factors that ca n precipitate or a ggravate anxiety, o r new issues may have arisen, so ask about the following issues, or revisit them if you asked previously. Life stressors (recent losses, job changes, finances) Diet (caffeine in colas, coffee, tea ; stimulants in chocolate) Medications (asthma and cold medications, steroids, etc. See list in D iagnosis section) Alcohol use or use of other substances Ask patients what ef forts to control a nxiety they have already made? Inquiry should include the following a reas: Exercise, including Yoga, Meditation or Relaxation training, etc Self-\u00adhelp manuals and stress management tools Psychotherapy Ask what has previously helped, a nd are they willing to return to doing what helped in the pa st?Would they like a recommendation about a new strategy? Can they do this on their own or do they need a coach to guide their self-\u00admanagement program? Ask about how convinced they are tha t they should take some action, and how confident they are about their ability to follow any proposed course of action. Ask directly but not in an a ccusatory way about medication adherence, perhaps with a question like the one that follows: \"Many patients find it dif ficult to take their medication as prescribed for a variety of different reasons. Has this been true f or you?\" If the patient acknowledges problems, continue the explora tion. \"Sometimes people stop taking their medication because of unpleasant side effects. Have you experienced side effects that led you to discontinue your medication?\" Advise refers to information about anxiety or its management. You might say, \"Many patients tell me how hard it is to take the medication every day, and I understand this problem. Anxiety medica tions have some special problems=sometimes I the medication takes a f ew weeks to kick in, a nd if you don't take it reg ularly, you don't get the benef its. May I share with you some of the sugg estions that ma ny of my patients find helpf ul?\" Or..., \"Patients with anxiety usually tolera te caf feine poorly. It makes anxiety wors e and should be eliminated from your diet. That can be hard to do, so I sugg est that you slowly eliminate it by mixing decaffeinated coffee with your regula r coffee and gradually reduce your caffeine intake over a period of several weeks.\" Agree involves helping the patient develop and \\set a specific personal a ction plan. Personal action plans should be specific behaviors; e.g., taking medication twic e daily, exercise three days a week, medita te for 20' daily, etc. The strategies in a personal a ction plan must be developed and agreed to by the patient, although the clinicia n usually provides helpful suggestiong. Here is an example of patient-\u00adcentered personal action planning, \"Since it is hard to take medication regularly, I wonder if you wish to make any plans now about how to take your medication ?\" Assist refers to helping patients' develop solutions to barriers to carrying out personal action plans, such as cost, discomfort, medication side-\u00adef fects , or diff iculty sticking to a planned routine ). \"It sounds like you are having trouble getting started on your meditation practice. Let' s brainstorm a bout changes you could make that might get you going; wha t ideas do you have?\" Arrange ref ers to ensuring tha t follow-\u00adup a rrangements are tailored to the patient's specific needs. \"I want to track with you how you are feeling a nd how you've been able to do with your action plan. Two weeks seems right to me... What do you think?\" VIDEO (not shown in print-\u00adout text) Steven Locke, MD , is the Clinician in this video CONCLUSION The skills elaborated and described in this module can be used to communicate effectively with anxious patients, to evaluate whether their a nxiety symptoms stem from an anxiety disorder, to inform patients about the meaning of their symptoms, to minimize patients' pain and suff ering, and to initiate treatment. Anxiety disorders are disruptive, painful, and serious medical conditions that contribu te to poor relationships, social isolation and poor work performance, a nd frequently lead to development of a substance abuse disorder. Anxiety disorders are treatable. Good communication skills enable clinicia ns to build a strong alliance with patients. When patients experience a trusting and respectf ul relationship, they disclose symptoms, listen to clinicia ns' descriptions of how and why anxiety disorders make them feel poorly, and are more likely to undertake treatment and adhere to recommendations. In addition, clinicians who utilize these strategies make positive contributions to their patients' lives and enjoy the professional gratif ication that comes f rom helping to relieve suf fering.

Considering your personal life and those of your f riends and family, to what extent are you able to diff erentiate depressed f eelings a nd aff ect from clinically signif icant depression? 2. Have you or anyone you have known been treated for depression? How have those experiences influenced your a ttitudes and skills related to working with depressed patients ? 3. Has anyone you have known persona lly ever been suicidal? How has that experience influenced your a ttitudes and clinical care? 4. In what ways have you encountered stigma with respect to depression? In what ways could stigma aff ect the way you interact with and support your patients? Key Principles: 1. Depressed affect is common, but clinically signif icant depression is a serious medical condition that requires f ocused communication skills to manage appropriately. 2. All patients with clinically signif icant depression must be assessed for suicidality. 3. Specif ic communica tion skills help clinicians to respond to depressed af fect, to manage stigma, negative health belief s and resistance, and to collaborate in negotiating eff ective treatment strategies. Learning go als: At the co nclusion o f this mo dule, yo u will be able to : Describe the dif ferences between depressed af fect and clinically signif icant depression. Inquire about the nine symptoms of major depression. Ask five questions to evaluate suicidality. Demonstrate empathic interactions with depressed patients. INTRODUCTION Many mistaken belief s limit diagnosis and treatment of major depression, a common illness. Specif ic communica tion skills help clinicians to overcome the typical barriers, and to facilitate their patients' short-\u00adterm and long-\u00adterm management and healing of depressive illnesses. The illness of depression and its variants are common in society, and more common in people who are seeking medical care, but the diagnosis is f requently overlooked. S ocial stigma and negative attitudes limit the insight, interest and ability of both patients and clinicians to discover depression. Patients with depression of ten complain of physical symptoms and clinicia ns frequently fail to connect these somatic problems with other clues to establish the correct diagnosis. Treatment of depression is effective, and many patients go unnecessarily untreated, continuing to suffer, miss work and cause distress in f riends and families. This module presents basic concepts as well a s special communica tion challenges, and focuses on strategies and skills that will assist patients to become more comfortable discussing symptoms and more likely to accept the dia gnosis and treatment of depression. MULTIPLE MEANINGS OF \"DEPRESSION\" \"Depression\" can mean either the feeling of \"sa dness\" or a serious illness. Misunderstanding and carelessness in using \"depression\" leads to misdiagnosis and substandard care. The term \"depression\" has at least two rela ted, but distinct meanings. On the one hand, the word \"depression\" refers to an affect, a feeling state, which can b e brief or long lasting. A synonym for depressed a ffect would be \"sad.\" Another use of the term, however, ref ers to a clinically signif icant medical illness that has specific signs, symptoms, and treatments. There are severa l different depressive syndromes - major depression, dysthymic disorder, and adjustment disorder withdepressed mood. Major depression is an illness and disease state, characterized by dysregulation of various neurotransmitters in selected areas of the brain, associated with genetic predispositions, a variety of personality variables, early life history, a nd current stressors. In both the lay public and within the medical context, the word depression is used in both ways - a circumstance leading to confusion among both clinicia ns and patients. Skilled clinicians have a clear understanding of the different meanings of the term, \"depression,\" and are able to utilize communication skills f or both contexts. MAJOR DEPRESSION The illness of depression has both psychological a nd physical symptoms. Major depression is the core depressive syndrome. Two cardinal signs/symptoms-\u00ad-\u00addepressed af fect and anhedonia (lack of the ability to experience pleasure)-\u00ad-\u00adcharacterize major depression, along with 7 other symptoms, 4 physical and 3 psychological. Four physical ones are sleep disturbance, appetite/weight disturbance, f atigue or loss of energy, and psychomotor agitation or retarda tion. Three psychological ones are poor concentration, low self -\u00adesteem or guilt, and thoughts of death or suicidal ideation. The two cardinal symptoms along with the two other groups of symptoms, (physical and psychological), are often considered the f our hallmarks of major depression. In addition, irritability is not one of the \"diagnostic\" symptoms of depression, but irritability is common in major depression and dysthymia, a nd clinicians should ask about it. Patients with relatively persistent depressed mood or anhedonia f or at least two weeks, along with a total of any 5 of the 9 symptoms listed a bove meet criteria f or the diagnosis of major depression. Depressio n can be fat al Every person experiences grief and sadness, but the illness of depression (\"clinical depression\"), with its persistent symptoms, has high morbidity and mortality. Clinicians and patients should not confuse the presence of depressed a ffect (sadness) with the clinica l syndrome of major depression f or several important reasons. First, depressed affect is a universal a nd unavoidable part of the huma n condition. However, rega rdless of circumstances, it is distinctly abnormal f or all-\u00adencompassing, painful, and debilitating sa d affect to persist da y after day, week af ter week, a nd month after month. In major depression, such a persistent sad af fect often accompanies anhedonia and the other physica l and psychological symptoms described above. Seco ndly, ma jor depression is a serious medical disorder with ma ny negative health consequences, even death. D epression is associated with suicide, and depression predicts future coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease as well as increased morbidity a nd mortality of many other physica l conditions. For example, the myocardial inf arction patient who suf fers from major depression af ter the heart attack is 2-\u00ad3 times more likely to die in the next few years than patients without depression. About 20% of heart attack patients suf fer from major depression.(1) Finally, major depression is usually treatable and reversible. Distinguish depression fro m grief Grief can be devasta ting, but it is limited to the feeling of sadness and it is transient. People with depressive illness develop symptoms in a ddition to sadness, and the symptoms persist over time.When people suf fer a loss, a grief response is norma l, and sadness is a major component of that grief. Note that grief can follow any kind of loss, not only the death of a loved one. People grieve after the break up of a love relationship. They grieve af ter losing a job, losing a limb, or loss of capacities from other illnesses, such a s loss of ability to play tennis after a back injury. A person may grieve having to give up a stressful job or stressf ul lifestyle after a heart attack. People may even grieve a fter losing something they never had - as when one realizes he will never achieve a dearly held dream. Grief often has a natural history, including periods of denial, anger, and sadness. D epending on personality, gender and the severity of the loss, most people are through the worst suffering in months and return to baseline in 6 -\u00ad12 months, though some sadness and longing may last f or years. Clinicians commonly think, \"Of course she's depressed, look at wha t she lost;\" however, the sadness accompanying grief is norma l, while the sadness of depression signals an illness. People who are grieving certainly f eel sad, but do not experience all the other hallmarks of depression such as low self esteem, guilt, suicidal thoughts, loss of a ppetite, poor sleep, and fatigue. Sometimes grief triggers a depressive illness, a nd when it does, the illness needs treatment.(1,2) Respo nd to tears Witnessing the suff ering indicated by tea rs stands as a fundamental component of the mission of medicine. Skilled and compassionate responses to crying f acilitate ef ficient and eff ective medical care. The sadne ss in patients' lives as well as the sadness of chronic or serious illness is an inescapa ble part of medical practice. Patients commonly cry in the doctors' office. Some clinicians think that patient tearfulness distracts from the \"rea l\" work of medicine, but nothing could be f urther from the truth. Clinicians who take their mission to relieve patient suffering seriously will strive to mindfully atten d to the distress of the patient who is sad, and assist in relieving it as skillfully as possible. In general, as a window into the patient's soul, tearf ulness becomes a unique opportunity to understand the patient and to build a strong alliance. In fact, it is often a good sign when a patient cries. First, it usually means you have gained the patient's trust, as patients generally do not cry in the presence of a clinician he or she does not trust. Second, tears usually a ccompany the discussion of an important life issue which you must help the patient address. Third, the tears may be an important signal to the presence of a depressive illness. Tearfulness seldom interferes with the other work of a visit, and most patients will cry for less than a minute, often apologizing and saying that they did not want to cry in your off ice. As you come to understand the thoughts that provoke sadness and tears, you gain an invaluable insight into the patient. Your empathic response begins the process of improving your understanding, and builds a solid therapeutic and working alliance that improves health outcomes. Once a patient begins to tear up, or starts to cry, a simple ref lective or caring comment is facilitative, shows your concern and encourages the patient to say more: \"I'm so sorry\" or, \"I can see this is very hard for you.\" After a few brief sentences f rom the patient, you may already understand enough a bout the situation to make a meaningful legitimating (empathic) statement, such as, \"Anyo ne wo uld be dist ressed in this t ype of situat ion. I am sure I wo uld be quite upset if I were in this situa tion also.\"NEGATIVE ATTITUDES Negative attitudes a bout sadness and mental illness are common, and negative responses to them can seriously undermine the clinicia n-\u00adpatient relationship. Ultimately, they impair clinicians' clinical ef fectiveness. Many patients and clinicians have had emotionally charged persona l experiences with depression that shape their current attitudes. They may have had a depressed parent or relative whom th ey could never please or help; a depressed parent who was always angry, depriving or even abusive; or perhaps a depressed parent who helped cultivate a profound sense of responsibility for caretaking of others. Conversely, ma ny clinicians have experienced depression themselves or have had a depressed spouse or child with depression. With the strong cultural empha sis on independence and achievement, depressed individuals may f eel guilty or distressed because they lack energy to be self-\u00adsuff icient and productive, thinking they should be able to \"pull themselves up by their bootstraps.\" These f actors contribute to the widespread notion that mental illness, including depression, is a form of moral weakness or failure. Like their patients, clinicians may also hold these negative, stigma tizing attitudes toward depression. Unfortuna tely, medical trainees a nd practicing clinicians themselves suf fer from high rates of incident and chronic depression. Patients commonly expla in away depressed feelings as \"understa ndable\" or \"normal\" under stressful circumstances. They deny to themselves and others tha t they may be suf fering f rom clinica lly signif icant depression, often thinking or saying that they have \"g ood reasons\" to feel sad under the circumstances. If they are grieving a loss, they may mistake a new clinically signif icant depression f or a normal grief reaction. Consider your personal experiences with depression and reflect on how those experiences have shaped your attitudes. You might have difficulty connecting emotionally with patients who have a depressed a ffect, or you ma y worry about \"making\" patients cry. Ma ny medical tra inees are overly cautious about a sking about emotional topics, or worry about \"prying\" into the causes of a patient's sadness. Such concerns a re common a nd norma l, but can seriously impair your clinical effectiveness. Exploring your own attitudes a nd coming to terms with those which could hinder your ef fectiveness, will enable you to view depressive illnesses more positiv ely and to care for depressed patients with skill and empathy. ESTABLISH A DIAGNOSIS Patients often conceal their sadness or do not complain of sadness. Few clinicians employ screening strategies routinely. The ra pid pace of medical practice may impede diagnosis of depression. Depression is common among medical patients. In disadvantaged populations the prevalence may exceed 30%, which a rgues f or vigi lance and frequent screening. Some clinicians and researchers argue that every patient should be assessed f or depression at every visit, but we believe targeting screening assessments to patients at high risk for depression represents a more ef ficient and pragmatic strategy. High risk patients have been shown by research to include those with chronic illnesses (diabetes, heart failure, etc), patients with recurrent unexplained physical symptoms such as pain, fa tigue, neurological symptoms, etc, and patients undergoing lif e transitions or unusual stress. Too few general clinicians discover their patients' depressive illnesses. Studies show that in primary care practice, a bout half of patients with depression do not receive a proper diagnosis. Many factors contribute to this problem. Patients with de pression often appear to have normal affect often make a very conscious effort to hide their sad feelings. Patients seldom complaindirectly of depression. Clinicians can uncover hidden depression with screening stra tegies, but few clinicians routinely screen patients for depression. Medical practice today suf fers from compelling time constraints, and clinicians may focus their attention on other acute and chronic medical problems that demand immediate a ttention. Ask abo ut sadness and o ther sympt oms Ask direct questions about sadness, a nd follow up with further open-\u00adended inquiry. Eliciting the symptoms of depressive illness c an be very straightforward. However, clinicians should practice with mindfulness of the high prevalence of depressive disorders and attention to overcoming their own internal reluctance or hesitation about working with patients' sad af fect. Finally, clinicians must remember to ask directly about depressed affect, anhedonia and other symptoms. Effective opening questions a re simple. For example: \"Have yo u been feeling sad, blue, down in t he dumps?\" \"Have you no ticed that you don't enjo y things as much as yo u used to?\" If the patient responds positively to either one, proceed with further open-\u00adended interventions, saying something like: \"Could yo u tell me a little more abo ut your feelings of sadness o r your lo ss of enjoyment?\" Remember to respond actively and compassionately to patients' verba l and non-\u00ad verbal expression of emotions. Attend to non-\u00adverbal signals Non-\u00adverbal signs can alert clinicians to possible depressive illness and avoid inef fectual pursuit of somatic symptoms. Many patients with depression who conceal their sadness emphasize somatic symptoms such as insomnia and poor appetite or lack of energy. This distracts clinicians, who may f ocus on the chara cteristics of symptoms a nd order e ndocrine, cardiac or other work-\u00adups that are expensive, time consuming and ultimately f ruitless. However, patients often display non-\u00adverba l and para-\u00adverbal hints of underlying depression, a nd alert clinicians notice these signals, comment on them and follow up.(m14) Patients may look down when speaking, sigh frequently, or take in a breath as though they were going to sigh and then speak instead, with a breathy quality to their voices. They may reach f or their eyes or dab at them, though there a re no tears, or their eyes may start to glisten, as though they might cry. They might make helplessness gestures (a shrug of the shoulders, an upturned hand gesture followed by the hand dropping to the lap or table). Their voices may trail off by the end of a sentence, or have a \"flat\" qua lity. Some will sh ow an anxious af fect or other signs of anxiety, which often accompanies depressive illness. Another hint is your own af fect. If you suddenly feel sad about or sorry for the patient, it is often related to the patient's sa d affect. If you notice any of these, and simply say to the patient, \"you seem sad to me,\" f ollowed by silence, the patient will often start to cry.Stigma pro duces co nflict Because of the stigma attached to depression, patients and clinicians too easily attribute symptoms to \"stress.\" Responding supportively is possible. Substantia l social stigma concerning all mental illness (including depression) exists in the public today, and as a result, many patients are embarrassed to disclose depressed affect or may simply deny its presence. This ca n create a head-\u00adto-\u00adhead conflict between doctor a nd patient. For example, the patient with chronic illness, physical complica tions, and significant life stress may have trouble sleeping, have trouble with energy and trouble with f atigue. When a sked, \"Are you depressed?\" the patient may respond by saying something like, \"Of course I' m depressed doctor, who wouldn' t be depressed, with all these physical problems a nd all the stress I am under!\" How can you respond to this challenge? It is helpful to reassure the patient and support his or her defense, while also encouraging a different perspective. Responses like the following a re often helpful: \"Many people would feel exactly like you feel. The kind of problems and stresses you have been having would certainly be upsetting for almost everyone. B ut I also wonder whether you might be suff ering from a kind of chemical imbalance that is now making it even harder for you to feel OK and harder for you to function. If so, treatment ca n really help.\" Busy, rushed clinicians occasionally invoke their medical \"authority\" when challenged by patients who deny depression. When challenged in this way by patients who are responding to the stigma, clinicians not unc ommonly turn to defensive, distancing, un-\u00adf acilita tive and counter-\u00adproductive responses , and say something like, \"Well, I do think you're depressed even if you are not aware of it.\" Do not say a nything like this! Try a simple empathic statement such as, \"Seems we are not quite on the same page; ...I hope I can find a way to be helpful to you.\" Getting around denial Asking about symptoms other than d epression or sadness is a reasonable way to engage patients and avoid potentia lly troublesome denial and unnecessary conflict. Denial of depression is a troubling patient response, and a frank denia l discourages compassionate responses from clinicians and invites difficulty in the doctor-\u00adpatient relationship. When asked a question about depression, the patient may simply state, \"I am not depressed.\" How can you respond to tha t, if other symptoms seem to point to depression? When the skilled clinician realizes that the patient may deny depressed a ffect or clinical depression, he or she will strategically a void or postpone direct questions about depressed affect, especia lly in the earlier pha ses of the interview. Inquiry about anhedonia is less threatening than talk about depressed affect. Instead of addressing depressed a ffect, it may be more judicious to begin with a question about anhedonia, such as, \"I have been wondering if you've been enjoying life lately?\" or \"I wonder wha t you' ve been doing f or fun these days.\" If the patient acknowledges anhedonia and at least four of the other nine symptoms of depression, the patient meets criteria for major depression even without acknowledging or count ing depressed affect as one of the nine symptoms of clinica l depression. For the purposes of diagnosis, then, the patient's response to inquiry concerning depressed affect is actually not pivotal to the diagnosis ofmajor depression. ASSESS SUICIDE POTENTIAL Ask each patient with depression about suicide, and be certain to know the 5 key questions that help a ssess suicidality. Every patient with depression should be considered a potential suicide risk and needs evaluation. Suicide assessment usually begins with a broad question about hopelessness, such as, \"Do you sometimes feel that life is no t worth living anymo re?\" The patient w ho answers positively to this question is said to have \"passive\" suicide ideation. Continue the interview to determine whether or not the patient also has active suicidal ideation. If the patient responds positively, f ollow-\u00adup with a n open-\u00adended question like, \"Can you say some more about this?\" Five f ollow-\u00adup questions comprise the basic and essential suicide evaluation in the primary care sector. If the patient does not reveal answers in response to an open-\u00adended question (above), these five questions should be asked directly: 1. \"Do you ever think abo ut actually killing yo urself?\" (If the answer is \"Yes,\" ask, \"Can you tell me some more about those thoughts?\") 2. \"Have you ever made an at tempt on your life?\" (If the answer is \"Yes,\" ask, \"Can you tell me some more about that?\") 3. \"Do you have a plan?\" (If the answer is \"Yes,\" ask, \"Can you tell me some more about your plan?\") 4. \"Having a t hought is different from actually carrying out a plan. Do yo u think there is a chance yo u might act o n this plan befo re I see yo u again?\" (If the answer is \"Yes,\" ask, \"Can you tell me some more about that?\") 5. \"If you do begin to lo se co ntrol o f yourself, do you think you co uld call me or go to an emergency ro om befo re you act o n any impulse to hurt yourself?\" The patient who claims he or she will contact the clinician or a n emergency room is said to be able to \"contract for safety.\" Contracting for safety is a useful intervention, but little research evidence supports its use. Thus, the ability or willingness to contract for safety ma y be a modest clinical measure of suicide risk, but you cannot use this guideline mindlessly. Patients who a nswer \"yes\" to questions 1 or 2 should be considered moderate suicide risks, while any patient who responds positively to questions 3, 4 or 5 should be viewed as a high suicide risk, and requires immedia te action, for example referral to a psychiatrist. AnnotatedVi deo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) PRESENTING THE DIAGNOSIS After establishing the presence of clinical depression and evaluating f or suicide, share your thoughts with the patient, a nd address stigma and barrier health belief s. Tell patients they have depression, but do not discount the primacy of their somatic symptoms and the eff ects ofdenial and stigma. Telling patients you think they have clinical depression can be a challenge. Many patients with depression come to the primary care doctor's office with chief complaints relating to physical symptoms like pain, f atigue and insomnia. They do not experience their problems as depressive in origin, so they are understandably concerned if doctors attempt to \"expla in away\" their symptoms as caused by a depression. Do not get ca ught in the trap of discounting physica l symptoms in the ef fort to properly diagnose and treat depression. Maintain a two-\u00adarmed or multidimensional approach: treat the physical symptoms with respect and concern, evaluate them and treat them conservatively and responsively. However, also treat the depressive syndrome a s an independent cause of suffering and disability. For example, the patient with stomach discomfort and a clinically signif icant depressive syndrome should be managed with the two-\u00adarmed multidimensional approa ch, such as: \"I understand the stomach pain is a problem. We want to do a few more tests and I a m prescribing a medication that should lower your production of acid. And I would also like you to consider treatment for another condition I think you are suff ering from: clinica l depression...\" Address barrier healt h beliefs Ask what the patient knows or feels about depression, and counter the belief that depression is a \"weakness\" by sepa rating characteristics like \"strength\" f rom illness. Stigma about mental illness and depression serves as both the cause and result of \"barrier\" health belief s. The most important barrier health belief is the notion that depr ession is a sign of weakness. This belief imposes a barrier that discourages a treatment alliance between doctor and patient. Clinicians ca n recognize the presence of a barrier health belief and address it straightforwardly. The only sure way to recognize the presence of a barrier health belief is to ask, \"I think you have some clinica l depression...What do you know about depression? How do you feel about the diagnosis of depression?\" The patient's a nswers will uncover health beliefs that ca n profoundly af fect a working alliance with the patient. If the patient says something like, \"Only weak people get depressed,\" you now have some insight into factors that may lead to non-\u00adadherence and have an opportunity to respond directly to the patient' s concerns. The clinician can then say something like, \"I understand how you might feel this way, a nd many people have the same feelings. It is important f or you to know that anyone can get caught up in depression and it has nothing to do with a person's strengths or weaknesses.\" Share info rmatio n abo ut depressio n Considerable resea rch points to structured strategic steps that ultima tely help patients understand the illness, construct a manageable treatment plan , and adhere to it. The f irst step requires elicitation of the patient' s belief s and perspectives, followed by the provision of smallamounts of information directed at those beliefs, f ollowed by a check f or understanding. Effective educa tion about depression begins at the same time that the clinician first presents the diagnosis to the patient. Good care necessitates understanding the patient's knowledge and perspective, with a question like, \"What is your understanding of depression?\" After the patient answers this question, you can respond to the patient' s emotiona l and cognitive concerns, and then offer short, concr ete, clear statements explaining the condition. Sometimes clinicians try to \"educate\" their patients with long monologues that are poorly understood and poorly a ttended to. Patients become confused and overwhelmed with long explanations. On the other hand, clinicians who pause af ter providing short educa tional messages find that patients often understand better and reply with statements and questions that f acilita te emotionally relevant as well a s efficient and effective information transfer.(m9,10) \"While everyone gets sad once in a while and particularly when bad things happen, clinica l depression is a different story. Clinical depression has a persistent sadness and loss of enjoyment that is related to chemical imbalances in the brain that also cause poor sleep, low energy, slow movements, chang e in appetite, poor concentra tion, low self-\u00adesteem or g uilt, and hopelessness... The good news is that the condition is treatable... We usually prescribe either antidepressants and/or counseling... I think you owe it to yourself to consider one or both of these treatments. You deserve to feel better. What do you think...a re you willing to consider treatment for your depression?\" Some clinicia ns compare depress ion to other chronic illnesses with chemical deficiencies, such as hypothyroidism or diabetes. \"Depression is a deficiency syndrome like diabetes. If you don't have enough insulin coming from your pancrea s, your sugar goes up. In depression there is a deficiency of serotonin, a chemica l in your bra in that you need to have a norma l mood. If you don't have enoug h serotonin being produced in certain parts of your brain, it affects how you think and feel; you will have a low mood.\" NEGOTIATE TREATMENT PLANS Getting treatment at some time is more important than insisting that treatment begin today. Offer choices, including \"non-\u00admedical\" ones like exercise and socia lizing. Support autonomy and involvement, and assist the patient in developing a long-\u00adterm plan for self-\u00admanagement. Because many patients wil l resist accepting the diagnosis of depression or resist starting treatment, either counseling or medication, an open-\u00adminded attitude of flexible negotiation to the encounter is helpful. Off ering choices supports pa tients' sense of autonomy and involvement with planning, and increa ses adherence to the treatment selected. \"You have a clinica l depression that usually responds very well to treatment. The re are different treatments available. Depression responds to treatment with medication. And depression also responds to treatment with counseling. Some people prefer treatment with both medication and counseling, which is often the most powerful treatment. My persona l recommendation for you now is that you consider treatment with both medication and counseling. Would you be interested in these treatme nts?\"Patients who refuse trea tment initially may agree to treatment at a la ter point in time. Always leave the door open to future trea tment. Inviting signif icant others into the discussion ca n also be helpful. You could say something like, \"I understand that you are not willing to start treatment now. I would like you to think some more about wha t I have sa id, perhaps talk to your husband (or wife, or par ents, etc) and even bring him (or her or them) to your next appointment. We will watch you closely a nd see how you feel a t your next appointment in say, two or three weeks.\" Other strategies can help. Prescribing daily aerobic exercise helps alleviate the symptoms of depression. Encouraging patients to renew ties to friends, community, a nd places of worship can help relieve the isolation of depression and enhance social support. \"You haven't been going to church since your symptoms began a few months ago -\u00ad I remember you used to be a regular church-\u00adgoer and enjoyed volunteering at church suppers and the like. It will really help you feel better if you try to get back to the things you used to enjoy. I think it would be a good idea for you to consider starting to go to church a gain. Perhaps you would consider going this Sunday? What do you think of that idea? Suppo rt self-\u00admanagement Patients benefit from clinicians' strategic facilitation of their personal short-\u00adterm and long-\u00adterm plans to manage the behaviors that influence their health. Depression is a chronic, recurring illness. Like patients with other chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and heart f ailure, patients with depression who can learn about the illness and accept the responsibility for self-\u00admanagement have the best quality of life and the best long-\u00adterm outcomes. You can help your patient with chronic illness by supporting their own goal-\u00adsetting and problem-\u00ad solving. Evidence-\u00adbased techniques tha t clinicia ns can use to support self-\u00admanagement are contained in the framework of the \"5A's: assess, advise, agree, assist, and arrang e.\" (m16, 24, 25) Another useful f ging self-\u00admanagement is Ultra-\u00adBrief Perso nal Actio n Plan has 5 co re elements: 1. The plan must be truly patient-\u00adcentered, that is what the patient himself /herself actually wants to do, not what the doctor told him/her to do. 2. The plan must be beha viorally specific - that is very concrete and specif ic about what, when, where, how long, etc. 3. The patient should re-\u00adstate the complete plan (i.e. \"commitment statement\").The plan should be associated with a level of confidence (on a 1 to 10 scale) of 7 or grea ter. 4. If the confidence level is <7, the clinician and patient should begin problem-\u00adsolving on strategies to modify the plan. 5. There should be a specif ic date and mechanism for follow-\u00adup (or accountability). The Ultra-\u00adBrief Perso nal Actio n Planning is structured aro und 3 core questio ns: 1. Elicit patient pref erences/desires f or behavior change \"Is there anything you would like to do that will help you feel better over the next few days (weeks) before I see you again?\"___ What? ___ Where? ___ When? ___ How often? ___ Elicit commitment statement (e.g. \"I will walk f or 20 minutes, in my neighborhood, every Monday, Wednesda y and Friday before dinner\") 2. Check confidence level \"That sounds like a great plan. B ut changing behavior and sticking with a plan is actually very hard for most of us. If you consider a conf idence scale of 1 to 10, where '10' means you are very confident you will ca rry out the plan and ' 1' means you are not at all confident, about how confident are you?\" If confidence level <7, problem solve solution \"That's g reat that you feel a confidence level of 5. That's a lot higher than 1. I wonder if there are some ways we could modify the plan so you might g et to a confidence level of 7 or more. Perhaps you could choose a less ambitious g oal, ask for help from a friend or family member, or think of something else that might help you feel more confident about carrying out the plan\"? 3. Arrange follow-\u00adup \"Great, so let's make a date f or our next appointment, so we can check on how you're doing with your plan.\" CONCLUSION Because depression is such a painful, serious, but trea table condition, clinicians who develop the communication skills to meet these challenges will make positive contributions to their patients' lives. This module reviewed the specia l challenges of communicating with depressed patien ts. Clinicians need special skills to meet the many challenges of depression assessment a nd depression management in the general medical setting. In addition, clinicians who treat depression successfully will also feel the professional gratif ication that comes from helping patients feel better, from enhancing their qua lity of life and from improving their general medical prognosis. BEHAVIOR CHECKLIST Respond to depressed a ffect with empathy. Adopt attentive nonverbal position, such as, leaning f orward, head forward. Respond with soft, warm and caring tone of voice. Ask about the 9 symptoms of depression. Ask about suicidality, and ask the 5 f ollow-\u00adup questions. Address stigma or resistance with relationship building strategies (such as PEARLS; m6) and sharing of inf ormation about depression. Tell the diagnosis clearly and directly, and in a supportive manner. Share information about depression, using simple language without jargon, short sentences, and checking for understanding. Explain treatment recommendations, using simple language without jargon, short sentences, and checking for understanding.Ask about patients' perspectives on the nature of the illness and ideas for treatment, and respond with respect a nd acceptance of those perspectives.

It is her companion gently asking if everything is okay and reminding her that he'll be in the waiting room if she needs anything. Even though the interruption is minimal, you notice a slight change in your patient: she becomes distracted and looks away more. You ask her about this relationship; she remarks tha t he's very good to her in that he takes her to her appointments, makes sure she is never alone, and guides her as to how to do things. Only after you persistently question her, she slowly a nd hesita tingly cries. At the same time, she repeatedly asserts that he \"takes care of me and teaches me how to do things correctly.\" 1. What will you do next? She has been scheduled f or a 15 minute appointment but you highly suspect a buse. 2. What must you ask a bout? 3. Do you have a ny legal obligations in dealing with the abuse? 4. What ca n you off er her? 5. What do you document in the chart? Key Principles: 1. Intimate partner violence is common, in fa ct equally common through socioeconomic classes, cultures, and racesand. Abuse is often missed in clinical practice. 2. Abuse victims rarely complain of abuse, but they do often comlain of multiple somatic problems and give a history of injuries. 3. Abused patients often have associated psychological issues. 4. The health care provider' s words are critical in moving patients from being victims to becoming survivors of abuse - the key is empowering patients ra ther than telling them wha t to do. 5. Understanding each patient's unique situation is critical to therapeutic planning. 6. Multidisciplinary approaches work best.7. Helping patients overcome abuse may ta ke months or years.

It cuts across all socioeconomic groups, cultures, ages, and gender identities. In 2005, the CD C's annual random telephone survey of non-\u00adinstitutiona lized US persons > 18 years included an optiona l Initmate Partner V iolence (IPV) module. Of the 70,156 respondents, 24% of women and 11% of men had lifetime IPV victimization. Nearly one in four women in the United States reported experiencing violence by a current or former spouse or boyf riend at some point in her life. (Adverse Health Conditions and Health Risk B ehaviors Associated with Intimate Partner Violence; United States, 2005 CDC. MMWR Weekly. February 8, 2008 / 5 7(05);113-\u00ad117. http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5705a1.htm ) Older medical studies show simila r demographics. A random sample of women aged 18-\u00ad46 f rom three public hospital prima ry care clinics (n=734) who were questioned a bout their history of physical, sexual, and psychological abuse reported a 15% prevalence of recent (within the last 12 months) abuse by an intimate partner and a lifetime prevalence of 51% (1). A self-\u00adreported survey presented to all adult women seeking care from a family practice clinic in the Midwest (n=394) showed a 22.7% prevalence of physica l assa ult by their partners within the last year and a lif etime rate of 38.8% (2); another self-\u00adadministered survey of all patients ra ndomly presenting to three university-\u00adaffiliated internal medicine clinics in California (n=453) indicated a 14% rate of current domestic violence and a 28% lifetime rate (3). Looking at medical records of all female trauma patients presenting to an emergency department, McLeer and Anwar (4) found a 30% incidence of battery leading to their presenting symptoms. A nother study of female adolescents (n=4163) found that 1 in 5 female students reported being physically and/or sexually abused by a dating partner (5).Globally, a 2005 World Health Organization study of 24,000 women f rom 15 sites in ten countries reported that women who had experienced physical or sexua l IPV in their lifetimes ranged f rom 15 percent (Japan) to 71 percent (Ethiopia ), and most sites fell between 29% and 62%. (Garc\u00eda-\u00ad Moreno et al. 2005. WHO Multi-\u00adcountry Study on Women's Health and Domestic Violence Ag ainst Women. World Health Organization. http://www.who.int/gender/violence/who_multicountry_study/summary_report/en/index.html ) Abuse does not have boundaries. Men who have sex with men experience violence. A telephone survey of 2880 men from 4 cities from 1996-\u00ad1998 f ound a prevalence estimate of 34% for psychological / symbolic battering, 22% for physical battering, and 5% f or sexua l battering. (Greenwood GL et al. Battering Victimization Among a Probability-\u00adBased Sample of Men Who Have Sex With Men. Am J Public Health. 2 002;92:1964-1969.) A self -\u00adreported, anonymous survey of 521 adolescents at a gay, lesbian, bisexual (GLB) youth rally found the prevalence of dating violence among GLB adolescents to be similar to that of heterosexuals. (6) A nationally representative telephone survey asking about lifetime experiences with domestic violence compared same-\u00adsex cohabitation with opposite-\u00adsex cohabitation and found a high er prevalence among same-\u00adsex cohabitants and specif ically among gay male couples. (7) Another national sample of 283 gays and lesbians found that 47.5% of lesbians and 29.7% of gays have been victimized by their same-\u00adsex partner. (8) When a buse occurs during pregnancy, it could have two victims. A random sample of pregnant women from two public prenatal clinics in Texas and Maryland (n=1203) found a prevalence of 16% physical and sexual abuse during the pregna ncy.(9) Another self-\u00adreported survey of 6143 women in South Carolina (population-\u00adbased data) noted an 11.1% prevalence of physical abuse during their pregnancy. (10) RAMIFICATIONS OF VIOLENCE Violence has many insidious consequences for the patient, always involves the family, and may produce f uture violence as children mature. It is important to establish a diagnosis of abuse. When the diagnosis is missed, patients continue to suffer and may die. Patients experiencing violence may not come to you with an injury. They often appear with physical or psychological symptoms, such as anxiety, loss of appetite, pelvic or abdominal pain, headaches, diarrhea , and problems sleeping(11). A random telephone survey of 3568 women from a US health plan (not seeking medical care nor identified as IPV in past) found strong a ssociations between past year IPV and a variety of medical/psychosocial conditions in 18 ma jor area s. Victims of abuse have an increased risk of depression compared to women without partner abuse (1), and are at increased risk of substance abuse and suicide (12). Abused women had a more than 3-\u00adfold increased risk of a sexually transm itted disease and a 2-\u00adfold risk of lacerations as well a s increased risk of acute respiratory tract infection, ga stroesophageal reflux disease, chest pain, abdominal pain, urinary tract infections, headaches, and contusions/abrasions. (B onomi AE, et al. Medical and psychosocial diagnoses in women with a history of IPV. Arch Intern Med 2009; 169(18):1692-\u00ad1697.) There a re ramifications beyond individua l suffering, including concomitant child abuse and the potential to produce a cycle of violence in later generations (13). Children who witness IPV are more likely to exhibit behavioral and physical health problems such as the following: depression, anxiety,violence towards peers; attempting suicide, abusing drugs and alcohol; other high risk behavior. ( Graham-\u00adBermann SA, Seng J. 2005. Violence expos ure and traumatic stress symptoms as additional predictors of health problems in high-\u00adrisk children. J Pedia trics 2005;146(6):349-\u00ad 354.) A study of 8629 participants showed a statistically significant graded relationship between the number of childhood violent experiences and risk of IPV. Physical abuse during childhood increases the risk of future victimization among women and the risk of future pe rpetration ofabuse by men more than two-\u00adfold. (Whitfield, CL, et. al. Violent childhood experiences and risk of intimate partner violence in adults: Assessment in a large health maintenance organization. J Interperson Violence. 2003;18(2):166-\u00ad185.) When violence occurs during pregnancy, the effects can be even more pronounced, such as preterm delivery (14), cesarean delivery, hospitalization f or complications (10), and impairment of coping mechanisms.(9) Intimate partner violence is costly. One study revea led that a large health plan spent about $2000 more per patient f or abuse victims, who had more hospitalizations, general clinic use, mental health services, and ref errals (15). In another study in which residents evaluated standardized patients for various clinical scenarios, residents missed the history and ordered unnecessary tests to evaluate the abused patients. Furthermore, residents who missed the DV diagnosis spent nearly twice as much working up their patients (16). UNDERRECOGNITION OF IPV Intimate Partner V iolence is often unrecognized in general practice, emergency centers and in hospital settings. When it is recognized, clinicia ns often do not respond ef fectively. We tested 71 residents in a multi-\u00adstation standardized patient exercise where one station depicted a scena rio common to abuse vict ims\u2014a woman presenting with chronic headaches, who, if asked appropriate questions, would admit to having an abusive partner. Forty (56%) residents correctly diagnosed IPV. Still, the majority gave inappropriate (even dangerous) treatment recommendations (16). There a re many reasons for under-\u00adrecognition of IPV. Many clinicia ns do not screen for abuse, or do not have a high index of suspicion. Many clinicians are uncomfortable asking questions about abuse. Many fear that if they ask a bout abuse, they won' t know how to respond. On the patients' side, abused women are often embarrassed or ashamed by the abuse and will not readily admit the abuse to their practitioners. They often present with a variety of somatic symptoms, a nd clinicians can of ten get sidetracked working these up. Many women are afraid to admit the abuse: they may have been threatened with even more violence if they reveal the abuse to anyone. Many are ambivalent about their rela tionships with their abusers, hoping that things will turn a round; some f eel that they are at fault or are bad, or deserve the abuse. Many women have concomitant mental health problems, such as depression or alcohol a buse, tha t cause their own problems and may distract from the dia gnosis of abuse. To admit abuse, a patient must feel completely trusting of clinician, feel that there is time to talk about it, and that the clinician cares. SCREEN FOR IPV -\u00ad IPV IS \"SECRET\" Screen for violence by asking direct questions. As of 2013, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends \"that clinicia ns screen women of childbearing age f or intimate pa rtner violence (IPV), such as domestic violence, a nd provide or refer women who screen positive to intervention services (B recommendation ). This recommenda tion applies to women who do not have signs or symptoms of abuse.\" (28) As long ago as 1992, the AMA recommended... \"to routinely screen (women) for victimization\u2014 including intimate physica l and sexual a ssault, in initia l and ongoing a ssessments.\"(17) Unfortunately, routine screening for IPV is infrequent (10%-\u00ad25%), even in states where screening is mandatory (18, 19). Yet, clinicia ns believe it is part of their role to assist victims of IPV (20). It is important to ask straightforwa rdly about abuse. A bused women feel a good deal of guilt,shame and fear about their situations, and are understandably reluctant to disclose. Normalize questions about domestic violence by including them with other \"routine\" psychosocial history questions like smoking and drinking. Or bring up abuse while asking about other saf ety questions, such as seat belts or weapons (21). Experts suggest questions like these: \" I see many patients who are dealing with a busive relationships. Some are too uncomfortable to bring it up so I ask about it routinely. Are you involved with someone who physically or emotionally hurts you?\" (22). \"Who do you live with? How do you get along? How do you/your partner manage your anger? Do you ever ha ve physical fights?\" As discussed earlier, many women may be reluctant to reveal the abuse; don't expect victims to immediately open up to you. If a patient seems hesita nt, or equivocal, or looks down when she answers, or chang es the subject, or says something like, \"I'm just trying to be a g ood wife,\" you can gently encourage her: \"It sounds like it' s hard for you to talk about this.\" If she nods in assent, you ca n reassure her of confidentiality, and your willingness to listen. Use attentive silence (Module 6) to give her a chance to gather coura ge to respond. Beyond routine screening, suspect abuse when women present with symptoms that seem stress related, such as headaches, muscle aches, fatigue ... or if they have multiple somatic complaints with nega tive work-\u00adups f or organic ca uses. Beyond diagnosis, your most important role is to provide \"inf ormation, support, and a saf e environment\" f or discussion whenever the patient is ready (23). WHAT DO YOU ASK ABOUT ONCE THE PATIENT DISCLOSES VIOLENCE? It is important to understa nd something about the patient's background and the development of the abusive relationship, before you can begin to make suggestions. Ask, \"Can you tell me something about your life, what your childhood was like, how you got into this kind of relationship? Tell me something about your partner.\" Many abused women grow up in abusive homes. As children many have witnessed violence against their mothers a nd are often victims of physical and emotional abuse themselves. Often a parent is an alcoholic. Ask, \"Many women who are victims of intimate partner violence have experienced sexual or physical abuse growing up. Has that happened to you?\" As children trying to make sense of their lives, they assume that they are being punished because they are bad. They grow up with the sense that they are bad, that t hey are undeserving, not good enough, not intrinsically lovable, that life is uncontrollable. They grow up expecting to be rejected and hurt. Many fa ll victim to the common psychologica l defense of \"repetition compulsion.\" They run away from home at an early age to be with a man that they think will treat them with respect. They may know that there may be problems with the relationship but f eel that if they love the new partner enough, they can reform him. Too of ten, these partners become abusers. Their sense of lack of choice is compounded by their ambivalence and confusion. Abusers often take their victims through a cycle of violence-\u00adhoneymoon where immediately after an outburst of violence, theabuser apologizes and is extremely caring towards the victim. This may last for some time; then the pattern of abuse gradua lly escalates. Abused women feel that their partner loves them, and needs them, a nd they often have strong feelings of love and need as well. After the apology the victims start to hope again and positive f eelings may resurfa ce. When the abuse recurs, a ll of the negative f eelings a bout self, the sense of helplessness, and the positive feelings for the abuser all combine to paralyze the victim's will. They see no way out. Also, practically, they may have few choices. They a re often financially dependent on the abuser, have children in school, f ew social and fa mily resources, and feel if they leave they will have nowhere to turn. Reading narratives written by survivors of abuse can give you insight into the worlds of abuse victims. Key Quest ions There a re other key question s you must ask once you learn about abuse. Ask abo ut her tho ughts and feelings, and any plans. It is important to understand your patient's reactions to her situation. S he may blame herself or feel she deserves the abuse. She may be desperate but sees no way out. She may have thought about leaving in a tentative wa y, or she may have decided to do so but needs help. Ask gently about what she thi nks and f eels about her situation and about any plans she may have made. Ask abo ut safety. First, assess if she is in immediate danger once she leaves your off ice. Has the pattern of abuse escalated lately? How severe have been the physical injuries? Has she had to go to the ER? If the abuse has not escalated, ask about the possibility of serious abuse in the future, i.e., does the abuser have a weapon ? Ask abo ut child abuse. Ask if anyone else is being maltreated-\u00ad-\u00adas children often witness abuse or are victims themselves. If there is concomitant child abuse, you have a legal obligation to report this. Ask abo ut mo od. Depression and suicidal ideation is common a mong victims of abuse (1, 12). Depression can paralyze the victim's will, and make her situation seem more hopeless than it is. Adequate trea tment of depression often enables the victim to think more clearly, improves her self-\u00adesteem, and lessens her tolera nce of abuse. If you are referring her to a therapist, be sure to cite abuse as a reason, f or a possible stigma of mental incapacity may be used by the abuser in custody battles later.Ask abo ut substance abuse. Ma ny women will try to escape the pain of abuse by turning to drugs or alcoho l. Substance use and abuse only complica tes the situation and keeps her trapped. If she is a busing substances she will need treatment for that problem as well as her abuse. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ONCE THE PATIENT DISCLOSES VIOLENCE? It is important to say several things: 1. \"This is wrong.\" 2. \"It's not your f ault.\" 3. \"You are not a 4. \"You have a choice.\"1. \"This is wro ng.\" The personal and emotional history of IPV victims often instills the errant belief that abuse is what life has to offer f or them. Your strong statement, \"This is wrong. No one has the right to put a hand to you, no matter what!\" can shake the abused woman's world, and be the beginning of her thinking dif ferently. Empower the victim by telling her she does not deserve such treatment. It is important not to seem like you are scolding her (\"Why do you stay with him?\") (22) 2. \"It 's no t your fault.\" Too often, abused women blame themselves f or the abuse, saying things like, \"I should have had his dinner ready on time. It is the least I can do - he works so hard.\" \"If only I were a better wife, things would be dif ferent.\" The abusers often shift the blame onto the victim and ma ke verbally abusive statements about the victim's worthlessness. You must reinforce the notion that ab use is not the victims' fault. \"Please don' t blame yourself. Nothing about this is your f ault. Nothing you do should provoke him to hit you.\" 3. \"Yo u are no t alone.\" Abused women feel isolated and alone. This is f requently reinforced by the abuser, who has over time systematically worked to cut off contacts with the victim' s family and friends. Let the patient know that domestic abuse is all too commo n, and tha t there is a good deal of support ava ilable in the community. Let her know that you will be available to work with her to help her to make choices f or her life. 4. \"Yo u have a cho ice.\" Women in abusive situations often feel trapped. They see themselves as victims of fate without choices. The great insight that allows them to begin the first steps away from being a victim of abuse to being a survivor starts when they realize that they actually have choices in their lives. You can help them come to that realization: \"You don't have to live like this. You can choose another course. There a re hard choices, but there are choices, and you can make them. What have you thought about?\" COUNSELING Urge the patient to seek counseling. Arrange for counseling immediately if needed. Do not tell people to leave their partners. If it seems too dangerous to return home today, you must actively intervene and ask if she would be willing to see a counselor immediately. Many hospitals and communities have such counselors available, and it is impera tive for you to know of these resources. Make a statement of concern: \"I admire your courage in telling me all this. From what you've told me about your husband' s recent behavior and his threats, I' m really worried about your going home today. Would it be ok if I called a domestic violence counselor who you could see immediately?\" If immediate danger is ruled out, ref erring patients for counseling is the core of IPV management (24). Make small educa tional brochures with emergency numbers of counselors, hotlines, and shelters available in your room and in your women' s bathroom. Thus, the patient can discreetly read a nd carry these sma ll cards on her. Tell the patient about specific resources and people she can ca ll as soon a s she feels safe to do so. Once referred, the counselor will then assess further safety issues and educa te her about her options. While it is reasona ble to ask the patient if she has thought about leaving the abuser, it is ill-\u00ad advised to recommend tha t she leaves, for many reasons. The f irst is that women start the healing process by rea lizing they have a choice. They are used to f ollowing orders from an authority figure. If you tell a woman to leave, she might just do so because you said it, which could precipitate a crisis in her life and endanger her. It is important to remember that leaving is the most dangerous time f or a victim of abuse. Also, if she leaves precipitously, she may have limitedchoices and financial support. Some women suddenly become homeless when they leave. To succeed, she must plan carefully. If she asks your a dvice about leaving and wants to plan to do so, educate her to pla n ahead: set aside some money regularly, copy all important records, disclose the abuse to family and friends in order to gain support and identify where she can stay once she leaves, alert company a nd coworkers about the existence of abuse. Remember that many women ma y try to leave many times before they succeed, and many women are not ready to leave yet, still hoping to salvage the relationship. If you show that you are judgmenta l or frustrated at a patient's unwillingness to ta ke necessa ry steps, it will undermine her trust in you and your ability to help her. Another generally accepted contradiction of treatment is recommending couples counseling (24). Abusers generally becom e angry when they learn the victim has revealed the abuse, and the violence may esca late. Also, abusers seldom benef it from this form of counseling. http://www.enda buse.org/resources/ provides a comprehensive review of resources. AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) WHAT DO YOU DOCUMENT IN THE CHART? The doctor's notes a re often the only other evidence of abuse besides the victim's voice, as there are often no witnesses to abuse (25). Legally appropria te chart documenta tion could be an invaluable asset to the patient in court. The National Institute of Justice has put out a report regarding documenting domestic violence. They note the following: When examining a victim, if there are injuries, take pictures, draw body maps, and describe the stage(s) of healing. Write who committed the injury and with what instrument. Describe the facts; do not write \"patient claims or patient alleges\" as this may introduce incredulity in the courts. As always, write legibly. (26) Legal is sues Make sure you are aware of your state' s laws about abuse. In addition to providing general standard medical care, clinicians treating victims of abuse may have legal obligations. As of March 1994, a ll but f ive states (Alabama, Louisiana, South Carolina, Washington, a nd Wyoming) have laws that to varying extents require reporting of injuries involving a weapon or a crime. As of 2001, six states ( California, Colorado, Kentucky, New Hampshire, New Mexico, and Rhode Island) specifically require reporting domestic violence. Still, reporting may have varying reasons: Rhode Island requires reporting f or data collection only whereas California requires reporting to the police (27). Since local laws vary state by state, providers must know local reporting laws or possibly be held liable for neglect. N ational D istrict Attorneys Association has a list of state laws regarding domestic violence. See http://www.ndaa.org/pdf/the_voice_vol_1_no_3_2006.pdf CONCLUSION Intimate Partner Vio lence is widespread amo ng wo men seeking medical care. It affects women' s overa ll well-\u00adbeing, a ny children involved, and society (by increasing cost of health care). As clinicians, there is much that we can do: we can help by screening for abuse, empowering and educa ting the victims, and ref erring them to specia lized domestic violence counselors.

Original Publication in Medical Encounter; Volume 12 No.2, Spring 1996; used with Permission This text is ava ilable for printout: LoneB earStory.pdf Introduct ion Three years ago last Thanksgiving I left my husband f or the f inal time. When I left I have to admit I did not know I was leaving permanently. I was just escaping. But looking ba ck I realize it was the f irst actual physical step I took to save my life. Now I see that events and people at the right times and places enabled me to take each needed step to make the final break. History I had been married for seven years. This was my second marriage and it was a typical domestic violent (DV) relationship with cycles of abuse and \"honeymoon\" periods. However, a t the time of my final leaving there were no longer any \"honeymoon\" periods. Our marriage was mostly extended periods of silence by my husband unless he was on a tirade or other people were present. I had left many times -\u00ad sometimes f or a few hours, other times overnight and a couple times for severa l nights. A few incidents involved the county sherif fs department. But never was anyone taken awa y or any f ollow-\u00adup done. My husband was classified disabled and had a very modest monthly income. I was the f ull-\u00adtime breadwinner. However, the \"control\" part of our relationship had progressed until my husband had full contr ol of all our income and expenses. He drove me everywhere and the only thing I did outside of going to work wa s attend his son's high school athletic activities and church on S unday. At the time of my final leaving the severe physical violence had ceased. Af ter a severe beating early in the ma rriage I filed for divorce. He then knew how much physical abuse I would tolerate. After a two-\u00admonth separation with promises of a Christian home (exactly what I wanted to hear) he drew me back in. This time my husba nd found I would tolerate pushes, being slammed against walls, squeezed, telephones ripped out, being confined, etc. I was isolated f rom friends a nd family. I was not only afraid of him, but embarrassed, confused, a nd by this time so dependent I just lived f rom day to day. Knowing this wa s not right but incapable of taking any a ction to get a way, I was always walking on eggshells to keep from shattering the peace. I came to welcome his punishments of ignoring me for days at a time. We attended an exclusive-\u00admembership church in Seattle where women were not allowed to speak. There was no interaction with the church outside of Sundays. He took a n active \"speaking\" role in this church . At home I was continually prea ched to about not being submissive enough a nd did not know my \"place.\" My faith in God wa s used ef fectively against me. To finish this history, I a m sure you know that the control issues did not just happen overnight. It continually escalated and the more I tolerated the more I lost control of my life. At the time just prior to my actual leaving, I don't belie ve I was actually suicidal but I was deeply depressed. And I can honestly say I felt death probably was pref erable to what my life was. My children (my only close family) had been pushed away f rom me. With my lif e far beyond my control at the time I just didn' t care if I lived or died. When my husband would go somewhere, I would hope something would happen to him so he would not come home.Leaving I had outpatient arm surgery (work related) the day before Thanksgiving (holidays are crisis times in D V relationships). My husband was giving me my pain medication. I was sleeping most of the time. B ut I was so drugged I didn't realize it or care. Due to an allergic rea ction to the pain medication (I have this problem with pain medication), I aroused enough to know I was not breathing properly a nd had severe itching. I asked my husband to call the surgery consulting nurse but he refused. I literally had to pull myself to the telephone in the kitchen (none in the bedroom) and call. She said to immediately call 911 for paramedics or if it wa s faster have my husband rush me to the hospital. I had my husband talk to her as he would not respond to my plead f or help. He hung up and said he wo uld drive me, walked out to the car and waited for me. B y pulling myself along I managed to get to the car. If his actions were public he a lways acted in a way that protected himself, i.e., talked to the nurse, took me to the hospital. B ut he off ered no help to me. At the hospital they treated me f or a drug reaction. B ut the doctor asked me why there were so few pills left. I told him my husband h ad been giving me the medication. The doctor had my husband come in from the waiting room and asked him why he had given me so many. I can remember my husband replied \"I just thought it was better for her to sleep.\" Af ter a few hours in the hospital I was sent home with my husband. The doctor could have been sending me home to die. When we returned home I waited until I felt \"normal\" and until my husba nd was not pa ying attention. I grabbed a few articles of clothing and wa lked out to the car. I managed to get in and lock the door before he ca me storming out. I then drove away and never went back. It has only been through D V group counseling tha t I have been able to a dmit that his intentions may not only have been to keep me quiet but to perma nently silence me. A murder threat against me telepho ned to my daughter and son-\u00adin-\u00adlaw during the time of the divorce proceedings confirmed this. Doctors Doctor A: My husband and I had the same primary care doctor. I really like him and went to him before I ever married my husband. I have since returned to this doctor as my primary care clinician. B ut to this day we have never discussed why my marriage to Steve dissolved. During the marriage my doctor treated me for stomach and bowel problems, asthma, chronic sinus infections and chest pains. It seems like I was a lways going to him f or something. He was treating all the symptoms and never finding out the real underlying cause of them. Whenever I needed to see the doctor, Steve alwa ys accompanied me, usually even into the exam room with me. The doctor would come in, take care of me and th en start visiting with Steve. Toward the end of the rela tionship I was constantly being monitored by Steve. One incident I know the doctor should have f ollowed up in private with me in some way. It was a typical doctor visit for me with Steve following me into the exam room. The doctor had completed his exam and ma de some comment to Steve (I do not remember what it was). B ut I do remember S teve re plying \"Ma ybe I should just knock some sense into her!\" The doctor did respond that Steve should not make those kinds of statements because he might have to view it as possible abuse. Steve laughed a nd said he was just joking. One thing my doctor did that probably helped me escape the relationship was ref er me to the medical group' s women's health practitioner, Marilyn. I saw her for my yearly female exams. She not only concerned herself with women's health but with the whole picture. As soon as she sa w how many medications I was taking, she said I had to take charge of my life. She recommended the stress reduction cla sses that were ava ilable. I did not take those classes, of course, nor was DV mentioned. But because of this initial visit and f ollowing visits, I trusted her and knew she wassomeone I could talk to. After I finally left S teve for good, I cha nged doctors. Since our doctor still was involved with Steve and his medical history, I felt it was easier for me to change, as usual putting Steve ahead of myself. During the DV training sessions I participated in someone asked me who initiated Steve's going into the exam room with me. This immedia tely made me feel like I was to bla me even now a fter three years and all I have learned in DV group. However, it was an honest question and I am sure one not intended to make me feel intimidated. I remember the first time it happened. The nurse called me in and said \"Hi\" to Steve. He asked if he could come in also because he wanted to ask the doctor something. The nurse said \"sure.\" I remember it because it wa s one of the times I actually realized my fr eedom was being diminished again. A great heaviness always settled in my chest whenever some new control happened in my life. It felt like some more of me was dying. Doctor B: My new doctor was even older than I was (I will be 50 this year). I went to him for a start-\u00adup physical and even though his ma nner was different I had no problem with him. Looking back I realize no questions were asked on t he forms or verbally a bout D V or related topics. During the divorce proceedings when I was being stalked, hara ssed and threatened (my daughter and grandson also), I landed in the hospital emergency room with a panic attack (severe chest pain). D uring my follow-\u00adup visit with my primary care doctor I told him exactly what had happened and the events causing the panic attack. He seemed embarrassed a bout it. He was very \"nice\" a nd as he left the room he patted me on the shoulder, told me to take care of myself and gave me a prescription for tranquilizers. Ma ybe it was in my record that I was going to the D V Group and had seen a mental health counselor but I don't think so. And even if it was, shouldn't he have recommended I continue with the group and counseling or have some form of follow-\u00adup? Maybe af ter all the years of denial, embarrassment, etc., I expect too much of other people, especially professionals, to help me. B ut it was a major step for me to open up and actually be honest with someone outside of the group. I knew this but guess he didn' t. Help It is only looking back on the events following my leaving that I see how the final brea k happened. It is very obvious to me now that there are five women that are responsible for me being where I am today, Perhaps even alive. I left on a Friday. I went to my daughter's and year-\u00adold grandson' s apartment to stay. At the time I did not realize the danger I was placing them in. Af ter a very harassing weekend, I was confused and frightened and I knew I had to get help. Monday I called not my doctor but Marilyn, my women' s healt h practitioner. The FIRST WOMAN I talked to on the telephone was either the receptionist or the nurse. I do not recall which it was. B ut I can honestly sa y whoever tha t woman was she played a very important part in my recovery .I did not tell her exactly what happened or the significance of it, but she must have picked up the crisis in my call because she got me in that very day to see Marilyn. At this time there were no same day visits scheduled even if Marilyn happened to be in the clinic that day. So whoever that woman is, thank you. If you hadn't got me in immediately, I might not have come in at all. That day when I saw MARILYN, I told her what had happened. I felt as if I was coming completely apart. Because of the groundwork Marilyn had laid out with me in the pa st, I could do all this honest falling apart in her presence. If my only resource had been my doctor, I probably would not have gone to him. Marilyn provided treatment for my physical problems, but, more important in the long run, she made me an appointment with a mental health counselor, JANE, the very next day. The next morning, I received a telephone call from mental health encouraging me to keep my appointment with J ane. This wa s a very important telephone call because I was already thinking of excuses f or not going. Remember for severa l years it had been my conditioning to not take any action on my own. Besides it was frightening and embarrassing to have to meet someone new and talk honestly about my life. The telephone call made the difference in my showing up for the appointment. After ju st a few minutes with Jane, I started to feel more at ease. She had lots of tissues and had a very quiet, understanding demea nor. Whether this is something counselors learn or is Jane' s personality, I don' t know. But it worked with me. She heard the above stories and also had me talking about my dysfunctional f oster home, my troubled half-\u00adbrother, and my Native American heritage. She also took me to the next crucial step in my recovery. She put me in touch with the DV therapy group, which just happened to be meeting the very next afternoon. Again, there was a telephone call the next day encouraging me to attend the group. Boy, do these workers know how we D V victims rationalize our inaction. A nd again, this was a real hard step f or me to take. With my self esteem at an all-\u00adtime low, I just di d not want to see a bunch of other women in similar circumsta nces as myself . I especially did not want to have to admit to other people how I had let my husband hurt and control me for so long. HILLARY A ND LAURA were the counselors/leaders of the group. And what a group, not what I expected. All a ges, all different stages of DV represented. It was easy to go there and see what I thought were circumstances a lot worse than mine. I had never had a gun held to my head or had young children held as bargaining power against me. Hillary, Laura a nd the other women in group a lways pointed out when I was still putting my husband ahead of myself . They helped me understand I was minimizing the danger I was in and also that of my daughter a nd grandson. They also helped me learn how to protect myself . Hillary could be very direct when she thought I or another was not recognizing a dangerous situation. Laura would always be there with suggestions and help when it seemed like we had run up against a wall. They were nice and always available whenever I ca lled, but they could be tough when necessary. One thing I learned about myself and group sessions is that it was always easy to not go, but I was always glad after I had attended a session. Now I find myself going to a meeting occasionally, usually during a crisis or new influence in my life. I attended the meeting right af ter Nicole Brown' s husband was f ound not guilty. I found myself very angry and upset about the verdict. I believe I related it to my divorce. I f elt my husband was rewarded for his abuse. In both cases, in my opinion, justic e was not done. Conclusio n During the training sessions, I was asked a s a DV survivor what I thought the medical group could do to help other D V victims to speak out and get help. My first suggestion is to get domestic violence out in the open. Domestic violence is not a dirty word unless it is kept silent within an abusive relationship. If all the survivors of domestic a buse would come out in the open as a group, I believe society would be astounded a t our numbers, our ages, our incomes, our races, etc. I always see Stop Smoking a nd Breast Cancer Exam posters in the clinic and exam rooms. Let's get domestic violence posters up also. Get the information out in plain view about crisis line numbers, DV shelters and groups. If I had seen DV posters when I went in to the clinic as much as I saw the others I might have sought help sooner. Remember, I was in the clinic a lot. If there a re injuries, ask and ask a gain. Remember we are afraid, may not have any resources to escape or a re so conditioned to deny even to ourselves the situation we will not be honest with the question. B ut if the opportunity is always given, there may come the time when the victim reaches out for help. The same is true f or new patient histories. Have the question worded somehow on the form. And remember if the spouse is with the patient (sitting together in the waiting room or at home filling the questionnaire out), the victim will no way indicate there is a problem. Even just three years ago, domestic violence was still pretty much kept behind closed doors. But public awareness has been greatly heightened since then, in part because of the Nicole Brown/Ronald Goldman murders and co urt case. There seems to be many books, newspaper, articles, television movies, etc., a ddressing D V. But I still hear people asking how an intelligent woman can stay in such a relationship. I guess unless you have actually been a domestic violence victim it is hard to understand the pain, the fear, the numbness that creeps in. Remember the abuser is usually someone we have loved a nd \"hope springs eternal.\" But please don't discourage any victim who reaches out in any way for help. It might be the only time she ever gets the chance. loading.. Welco me to DocCom Mo dule 29: Alcoho l: Interviewing and Advising by William D. Clark, M.D. and Sharo n J.

The Do ctor's View William Clark, MD Questio ns fo r Reflection: 1. How will your past experience with alcohol use problems in f amily, friends or patients affect your ca ring for future patients with a lcohol problems? 2. Recall encounters with patients with alcohol problems\u2014were there moments when you interacted less professionally than you would wish? 3. Ample evidence exists that dependent alcohol users cannot exert f ull control over their intake. What shapes your attitudes a bout whether you fully accept this evidence? 4. Patients whose lives are falling apart because of alcohol use seldom accept clinician recommendations. How do you feel a bout this?Key Principles: 1. Alcohol use problems exist on a continuum, with alcohol dependence on the severe end, at-\u00ad risk alcohol use at the other, and alcohol abuse in between. 2. Effective clinicians know the NIAAA saf e (modera te) drinking limits a nd talk with patients about them 3. Patients consistently minimize and cover up alcohol problems (both consciously a nd unconsciously), a nd clinicia ns delay action because intervention may be complex or difficult to implement. 4. Reconciling dif ferences in clinician and patient perspectives by using evidence-\u00adbased behavior change counseling skills is ef fective. Learning go als: At the co nclusion o f this mo dule, yo u will be able to : Demonstrate strategies and skills for assessing alcohol use. Describe differences between alcohol dependence, alcohol abuse, at risk alcohol use, and moderate drinking (within NIAAA sa fe limits). Demonstrate communication skills that minimize patient def ensiveness, f or asking questions, making recommendations and adjusting goals. Demonstraate the use of communication skills that differ according to patients' willingness to change. INTRODUCTION Alcohol use disorders af flict 20 percent or more of adults a nd lead to tragic f amily and socia l problems, injuries, and death.(15,21) Most clinicians feel inadequately prepa red to interact with af fected patients, and many express f eelings of dismay at having to do so. Screening and assessment improves detection(16,18,22), and counseling improves patient health and clinician satisfaction with their encounters.(8,12,16,18,21,24) Patients with alcohol use disorders suff er from toxic brain eff ects and from the debilitating psychological effects of isolation and poor social f unctioning, as well as emotional a nd physical violence to strangers, family members, and other loved ones. Helpin g them to change their drinking behavior requires that clinicians use specific interview techniques for responding to defensiveness and for encouraging change. This module defines and explores the spectrum of alcohol use disorders, and suggests ways to promote a therapeutic relationship despite patient impairments in thinking and behavior. Using evidence based behavior change strategies, students and seasoned clinicians in primary care or specialist practices can move from common feelings of dismay and begin to celebrate the successes they will foster af ter study and skills practice. We include an APPEND IX that includes both the AUDIT questions and reproductions of the Tables found in the main text section. CONTINUUM OF ALCOHOL USE DISORDERS Alcohol use problems exist on a mild to severe continuum, and generate another continuum of physical and psychosocial consequences. Structured screening is essentia l, and diagnosis may be elusive because of denial or a reticence to reveal informa tion. Nevertheless, experts agree on an evidence-\u00adbased classifica tion system that is useful in guiding clinicia n actions.(18) The term \"alcoholism\" is used loosely, usually ref erring to persons with an alcohol use disorder of unspecif ied severity. The following pages present clinically useful definitions. More extensive discussion and details of cla ssification are in reference papers and in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental D isorders, DSM-\u00adIV. Healthy alco hol use More than 50% of US adults a bstain or drink less than one drink monthly. Thirty per cent of adults drink more than \"sa fe limits.\" Of this group, roughly 10% will manifest al cohol a buse and another 10% alcohol dependence, a t a given point in time. (15,18) NIAAA Safe Drinking Limits(16) The NIAAA expert panel declares that \"safe limits\" for men are 14 or fewer drinks a week and no more than 4 drinks in a day. For women and those over age 65, they specify limits of 7 per week and 3 drinks in a day. Moderate Drinking. Expert consensus holds that \"moderate drinking\" is defined by low quantity of intake (<14 weekly for men and < 7 for women), a social setting for drinking, and little intoxication (not more than 4 drinks per occasion f or men and 3 for women). Drinking above these limits is variously ca lled \"at risk\", or \"hazardous,\" and is likely to cause harm, according to long-\u00adterm studies.(1,7) Standard drinks. (3,16) A \"drink\" is 12 oz. beer, 5 oz. wine, 2-\u00ad3 oz. of cordial or aperitif or 1.5 oz. (bar shot) of liquor or brandy; and each standard drink contains ~ 0.6 oz of alcohol. Alcohol contents are approxima tely as follows: beer 5%, wine 12%, and liquors 40%.* Alcohol is absorbed quickly from an empty stomach; but even when taken with food, all the alcohol in drinks is absorbed. *(12 oz beer x .05 (5%); 5 oz wine x .12; 1.5 oz .40; = .6oz ). Alcoho l dependen ce Alcohol dependence is a severe disease manifested by multiple a nd persistent life problems, with or without the brain disorder of physical dependence.(18) Alcohol dependence occurs a cross cultures and nationalities. A striking 5-\u00ad10% of American adultsdevelop this syndrome. Individuals with it suff er medical and psychosocial consequences from uncontrolled use. Importantly, the diagnosis of alcohol dependence may occur without the brain disorder of physical dependence. Patients with alcohol dependence are preoccupied with drinking, spend less a nd less time on other life activities and continue to drink despite life-\u00adthreatening medical and psychosocial consequences. They develop a distinctive interactive style, hiding importa nt facts, def ending their \"right\" to drink, a nd responding to simple inquiry with hostility and reticence. Patients usually make repea ted attempts to cut down or quit alcohol, and many will also develop physica l dependence, with withdrawal symptoms. Table 2: Sympt oms o f alco hol use diso rders. (16-\u00adadapted) If yes to one or mo re of the questions below, the patient has alcoho l abuse. In either case, proceed to assess for dependence symptoms. In the past 12 months, has patient's drinking repeat edly caused or contributed to-\u00ad -\u00adrisk of bodily harm (drinking and driving, operating ma chinery, swimming) -\u00adrelat ionship trouble (family or friends) -\u00adrole failure erence with home, work, or school obliga tions) -\u00adrun-\u00adins with the law (arrests or other legal problems)If yes to three o r mo re of the questions below, the patient has al cohol dependence. In the past 12 months, has the patient-\u00ad -\u00adnot been able t o stick to drinking limits (repeatedly gone over them) -\u00adnot been able t o cut do wn o r sto p (repeated failed attempts; may include abstinent periods) -\u00adshown t olerance (needed to drink a lot more to get the same eff ect) -\u00adshown signs o f withdrawal (tremors, sweating, nausea, insomnia, if trying to quit / cut down) -\u00adkept drinking despit e problems (physical, e.g., blackouts, overdose, gastritis, liver trouble; ical, e.g., anxiety, depression, request for psychotropic meds) -\u00adspent a lo t of time drinking (or anticipating or recovering from drinking) -\u00adspent less t ime o n other mat ters (activities that had been important or pleasurable) Alcoho l abuse People with alcohol abuse have less intense a nd less pervasive symptoms. On the contin uum, alcohol a buse falls toward the center, with moderate to severe consequences. Alcohol abuse is a \"maladaptive pattern of use leading to impairment or distress, manifested in a 12 month period by one or more of the following : failure to fulf ill role obliga tions; recurrent use in haza legal problems; use despite or interpersonal problems.\" What distin guishes alcohol a buse from alcohol dependence is not the nature of problems, but the frequency and pervasiveness of problems. B oth abuse and dependence result in health and legal problems, fa mily dysfunction, and impaired performance at school or work. When patients show neurochemical changes and symptoms of physical dependence, theappropriate diagnosis is alcohol dependence, not a lcohol abuse. (3) Table 2: Sympt oms o f alco hol use diso rders. (16-\u00adadapted) If yes to o ne or mo re of the questions below, the patient has alcoho l abuse. In either case, proceed to assess for dependence symptoms. In the past 12 months, has patient's drinking repeat edly caused or contributed to-\u00ad -\u00adrisk of bodily harm (drinking and driving, operating ma chinery, swimming) -\u00adrelat ionship trouble (family or friends) -\u00adrole failure (int erference with home, work, or school obliga tions) -\u00adrun-\u00adins with the law (arrests or other legal problems)If yes to three o r mo re of the questions below, the patient has alco hol dependence. In the past 12 months, has the patient-\u00ad -\u00adnot been able t o stick to drinking limits (repeatedly gone over them) -\u00adnot been able t o cut do wn o r sto p (repeated failed attempts; may include abstinent periods) -\u00adshown t oleranc e (needed to drink a lot more to get the same eff ect) -\u00adshown signs o f withdrawal (tremors, sweating, nausea , insomnia, if trying to quit / cut down)-\u00adkept drinking despit e problems (physical, e.g., blackouts, overdose, gastritis, liver trouble; ical, e.g., anxiety, depression, request for psychotropic meds) -\u00adspent a lo t of time drinking (or anticipating or recovering from drinking) -\u00adspent less t ime on other mat ters (activities that had been important or pleasurable) At risk o r hazardo us alco hol use The alcohol use disorder of a t risk drinking (or hazardous drinking ) includes both drinking in unsafe situations, and drinking above recommended limits, without important or sustained life problems. On the mild end of the continuum are \"at risk\" or \"hazardous\" users. \"At risk\" drinkers use alcohol above the recommended a mounts (see healthy use) (16), but do not yet have important negative consequences. \"Hazardous\" users ma y use alcohol in high-\u00adrisk situations such as when taking medications that interact with alcohol, during pregnancy, or while opera ting a chainsaw. Clinicians should intervene with such drinkers on the basis of the risks associated with higher quantit y or the risky situatio ns. In contrast, interventions with patients with abuse or dependence are ma de because of negative consequences. Clinicians need data about both quantity and consequences, a nd the meaning of \"quantity\" remains unclear until they obtain a picture of adverse consequences or lack thereof. Most people who experience serious life consequences use excessive amounts; but the intensity of clinical interventions should be based on the severity of problems, not on the amount consumed.(3,10,18) Pathophysio logy The pathophysiology of alcohol use disorders is a failure to consistently limit drinking. \"Denial\" severely limits normal social interactions and interferes with eff ective clinician care. Individuals modula te their drinking according to feedback from internal states such as shame orhangover, and external f eedback such as reprimands, criticism, and sanctions. The interplay of genetic, physiologica l, psychological and socia l factors determines an individual' s success or failure in limiting use. When a drinker cannot consistently limit use, the brain effects of heavy use facilitate a vicious circle of using more, developing problems, a nd the role of the intoxicant. This discounting of the negative ef fects of alcohol is often called \"denia l.\" Denial builds on both neurochemi cal and psychological cha nges. Heavy intake produces memory deficits and other cognitive problems, as well as the dysphoric effects of hangover. The bra in can adapt, becoming \"tolerant\", enabling even heavier drinking without overt intoxication. Friends and family resent the apparently voluntary nature of over-\u00ad indulgence. D rinkers ma ke excuses for their behavior, direct blame onto others, and show hostility whenever sensible limits are discussed. They become adept at ignoring reality and suppressing negative f eelings. Social dynamics become increasingly unhealthy and uncertain. The heavy drinker selects f riends and partners who tacitly a gree to overlook intoxication a nd its consequences. D enial is not only a powerful mediator of patients' interpersonal difficulties, but also of clinician difficul ty in establishing a diagnosis. With or without actual physical dependence, the problem drinker becomes emotionally isolated. This may be so extensive that family and friends sometimes feel that two separate individua ls inhabit the same physical body, a nd one of them is mysterious a nd unfathomable.(3) Pre-\u00adScreening Information and data about pa tients' alcohol use and misuse affects the diagnosis and management of all other medical problems and every aspect of medical care. Prescreen new patients with a single, simple question about alcohol (16): \"Do you sometimes drink beer, wine, or other a lcoholic beverages?\" If the answer is \"No,\" lea ve this topic. The a bstinent subgroup with past problems often discloses this spontaneously, although the clinician may want to explore selectively why a patient is abstinent. A \"Yes\" answer should be f ollowed up with a screen for at-\u00adrisk drinking , abuse and dependence. Remember tha t certain patients ma y be at-\u00adrisk with low intake, because of pregnancy, a medication interaction, a health condition or a work issue. Typically, conversations a bout alcohol begin \"on the wrong f oot,\" because of the dynamics that produce denial. All patients who use too much alcohol ha ve high levels of a mbivalence and resist talking seriously a bout drinking. Studies show that encounters that employ skills discussed in the following sections are more critical to success than getting any one encounter \"exactly right.\"(2,3,12,13,17,24) Show interest in the patient as a person with voice tone, gestures, and words that convey care and concern. Remain sensitive to cues patients put out that might signal issues about trust or veiled concerns. A possible empathic response to irritability or suspicion might sound like: \"Many people are concerned about these questions,\" or \"Let's back up a moment, as I'd like to explain why drinking might be important to your care.\" When patients seem vague, put off, confused or appear to be attacking the clinician, respond with a statement that reflects back the content of the patient's utterance.\"I hear some concern or irritation in your voice.\" or \"This line of questions seems to be conf using to you.\" DIAGNOSIS Confirm the presence of an alcohol use disorder through assessment of symptoms a nd evaluation of clues. Despite sca nt or imprecise information, tenta tively decide whether the evidence best f its a diagnosis of moderate drinking, at-\u00adrisk drinking, alcohol a buse or alcohol dependence (with or without physical dependence). Always begin with evidence-\u00adbased screening strategies.(5,9,16,20,22) Refrain from giving reassurance or answering questions about diagnosis or treatment during the assessment process. Allot time not only for investigation of physical, psychological and socia l symptoms, but also for discussion about the pros and cons of drinking and patients' perspectives about quitting alcohol. Clinicians do not ha ve to be certain o f the precise alcohol use disorder dia gnosis, since all interventions will address similar dynamics about rela tionship, trust and the process of cha nging drinking behavior. Over multiple encounters, clinicians improve diagnostic Subsequent pages and the videos in this section illustra te these principles. Intoxicatio n, tolerance, withdrawal In clinical settings alcohol on the breath, intoxication and tolera nce mean a high likelihood of an alcohol use disorder, and its severity is determined by further investigation. For practical purposes, withdrawal symptoms alwa ys mean alcohol dependence.(3) Alcohol on the breat h always demands further investigation, because it means the patient has recently had severa l drinks. If easily smelled, the alcohol level (BAL) is likely greater than 0.125 g/dl, a nd a less dra matic odor suggests B AL of 0.07 to 0.10 g/dl. Zero .08 is the lega l level f or driving. The B AL declines in linear fashion, a t approximately .015-\u00ad.020 g/dl/hr. Healthy drinkers do not attend clinica l appointments with alcohol on their breath. Even in the Emergency Department, someone \"under the influence\" is likely to have an alcohol use disorder, because only a tiny proportion of ED patients a re healthy drinkers who drank \"one too many\". In medical encounters any sign of intoxicat ion\u2014most prominently slurred speech, incoordination or emotiona l lability\u2014prompts a tentative diagnosis of alcohol use disorder, until proven otherwise. Tolerance is present if an odor of a lcohol is apparent in the absence of intoxication -\u00ad a person can look norma l with an alcohol level of 0.400 g/dl, or even higher. Tolerance is caused by heavy drinking lasting at least severa l days (usually weeks), indicates brain adjustment to alcohol, is inevitably toxic, and usually mea ns alcohol dependence. Withdrawal symptoms\u2014most prominently, anxiety, sweating, tremor and tachycardia-\u00ad-\u00addo not happen overnight, or on a short binge. B rain chemistry changes over periods of weeks and usually years of heavy drinking. The wor se the physical dependence, the more quickly withdrawal symptoms develop af ter the \"last\" drink. The symptoms cause an intense cra ving, and a f ew trials convince the person that a drink is an effective antidote. People begin to save a beer in the refrigerator, or a drink under the bed in anticipation of sha kes and anxiety during the night or in the morning; this drink is the eye-\u00adopener. In extreme cas es people try continuously to dampen the withdrawal sickness a nd then drink around the clock, never really sleeping or eating. D ependent individua ls in this situa tion ca n lethal complica tion of delirium tremens.Structured Screening: AUDIT /CAGE Clinicians are unlikely to discern alcohol use disorders without a structured screening strategy, and currently miss 60% to 80% of cases. The AUD IT and the CAGE are effective simple screens. Consistent use of a validated strategy is a powerful determinant of clinical ef fectiveness. One carefully validated screening strategy is the 10 question AUDIT, also available in Spanish. It ca n be self-\u00adadministered in a waiting room; it is sensitive throughout the spectrum of unhealthy drinking(10); a nd it is the best instrument f or identifying hazardous drinking (sensitivity 57-\u00ad97%, specif icity, 78-\u00ad96%).(see Appendix ) (16) Alternatively, many clinicians with the simple f irst AUD IT question(9,20): \"How many times in the past year ha ve you had 5 or more drinks in a day (f or men; or 4 or more drinks for women).\" (Positive screen is at least one day with 5 or more drinks [4 for women]) This closed question rather than open ones (Module 8) is helpful here. If patients answer open-\u00ad ended questions vaguely, f orcing the interviewer to ask clarifying questions, they feel accused of lying a nd become def ensive. If this response is positive, quantif y the drinking behavior. D etermine a weekly average by asking: \"On average, how many days a week do you have an alcoholic drink?\" and \"On a typical day, how many drinks do you have?\" Record and monitor heavy drinking days and the weekly a verage over time. The four-\u00adquestion C AGE test (Table 1, and Appendix ) is a validated screen, initially designed to test for alcohol dependence. However, CA GE is a good wa y to begin a conversation without fostering undue defensiveness, and easy to use.(3) If two responses are positive, it is 60%-\u00ad95% sensitive and 40-\u00ad95% specif ic for alcohol dependence, depending on the popula tion screened. CAGE is less a ccurate f or women and African-\u00adAmericans. To better detect at-\u00adrisk drinkers, the CAGE questions can be combined with consumption questions from the AUD IT).(10) Laboratory testing is of little use f or screening purposes.(5) Table 1. CAGE screening fo r dependence sympto ms. 1. Have you ever felt that you should Cut do wn on your drinking? 2. Have people Anno yed you by criticizing your drinking? 3. Have you ever felt bad or Guilty about your drinking? 4. Have you ever had a drink first thing in the morning to steady your nerves or get rid of a hangover? (Eye opener) AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) Other clues Unsolicited comments about alcohol, lega l issues, family comments a nd other evidence require more intensive data-\u00adga thering. You should f ollow up patients' spontaneous mention of \"partying,\" hangover, blackouts or withdrawal symptoms. The same is true f or a positive f amily history, arrests for driving while intoxicated, spouses or friends who confide about problems, and prior medica l records that indicate alcohol-\u00adrelated problems. Interviews with fa mily, nurses, or social workers, and records from other clinicians or hospit als may contain unanticipa ted information that establishes a diagnosis. ASSESSMENT AFTER POSITIVE SCREEN Additional assessment is required af ter a positive screen or to follow up another clue. Ask about typical symptoms, the pros and cons of drinking and readiness to cut down or quit. (16) Patients with problems minimize intake and consequences, and may lie outright. When inquiry provokes defensiveness , many clinicians experience frustration, often because of interactions with previous patients. This puts them out of balance and may make expression of ca ring difficult. Effective clinicia ns remain mindful of their f eelings a nd learn ways to respond positively. If any screen is positive or worrisome, or if patients spontaneously disclose drinking that exceeds safe limits or if another clue (perhaps f rom physical exam or the f amily) is present, take more history. Ask about the issues listed in Table 2. Ask about the patient's perspective (Module 9) on drinking and consequences. Table 2. Sympto ms o f alcoho l use diso rders. (16-\u00adadapted) If yes to o ne or mo re of the questions below, the patient has alcoho l abuse. In either case, proceed to assess for dependence symptoms. In the past 12 months, has patie nt's drinking repeat edly caused or contributed to-\u00ad -\u00adrisk of bodily harm (drinking and driving, operating ma chinery, swimming) -\u00adrelat ionship trouble (f amily or friends) -\u00adrole failure (interf erence with home, work, or school obligations) -\u00adrun-\u00adins with the law (arrests or other legal problems)If yes to three o r mo re of the questions below, the patient has alcoho l dependence. In the past 12 months, has the pati ent-\u00ad -\u00adnot been able t o stick to drinking limits (repeatedly gone over them) -\u00adnot been able t o cut do wn o r sto p (repeated f ailed attempts; may include abstinent periods) -\u00adshown t olerance (needed to drink a lot more to get the same eff ect) -\u00adshown signs o f withdrawal (tremors, sweating, nausea , insomnia, if trying to quit / cut down) -\u00adkept drinking despit e problems (physical, e.g., blackouts, overdose, gastrit is, liver trouble; psychological, e.g., anxiety,depression, request for psychotropic meds) -\u00adspent a lo t of time drinking (or anticipating or recovering from drinking) -\u00adspent less t ime o n other mat ters (activities that had been importa nt or pleasurable) AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text)Ask pro s and cons o f drinking Asking about benefits and negatives of drinking provides more data, encourages ref lection and builds relationship.(3,13) Asking screen-\u00adpositive patients to comment on the good things and the not-\u00adso-\u00adgood things about their drinking continues the conversation. The prior \"doctor-\u00adcentered\" (Module 5) screening and symptom questions are important f or diagnosis, but they limit dialogue. A more \"patient-\u00ad centered\" approach is to ask a bout pa tients' beliers about the role of alcohol. \"I'm interested in wha t benef its you g et from drinking alcohol\" invites their perspective. \"Yes, a nd what else is good about drinking?\" \"And what else?\" Show that you sincerely wish to hear their thoughts. Following up with asking about the \"cons\" invites them to reflect, and contributes valuable information, not only to assessment a nd diagnosis, but also to formulation and negotiation of next steps as the clinician moves toward planning interventions. Questions about quitting enhance your understanding of patients' situations. \"If you were to quit (or cut back to safe levels), what benef its could you ima gine,\" or, if appropriate to the patient, \"...what benefits did you notice during previous periods of abstinence?\" And, \"For you, what might be the negative consequences of cutting back?\" This level of conversation demonstrates interest in and valuing of the patient's perspective. The willingness to attentively listen (Module 6) contributes strongly to the ability collabora tively negotiate next steps. AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) Assess readiness t o change Listening to patients ' perspectives on their int erest in cha nging, and about their perceived ability to accomplish change prepa res the ground f or dialogue about next steps. Prochaska a nd collea gues proposed that people progress through typical \"stages\" on the wa y to successful lif estyle change(24). West(23) notes the \"soft\" nature of the \"stages\" and suggests that clinicia ns who affix \"stage\" labels ma y limit dialogue or fail to engage a spark of motivation in patients. We agree that co nversat ions about readiness help patients consider health behavior change, and tha t avoiding stage designat ions is a more relationship-\u00adcentered approach.(2) Ascertain patients' by asking about conviction and conf idence. Conviction assesses what patients believe about the importance of adopting or changing a behavior, whileconfidence assesses belief s about success at changing. Belief a bout success is often referred to as \"self-\u00adef ficacy.\" Ask patients to help you understand where they stand by requesting that they use a numerical rating scale: Understand patients' beliefs by using the rating scale above. Frame questions as follows: First-\u00ad-\u00ad\"On a scale of 0-\u00ad10, how convinced are you that quitting (or cutting down) is important?\" And then-\u00ad-\u00ad\"Let' s suppose f or a moment that you were a 10, completely convinced that you should quit (or cut down;) on a 0-\u00ad10 scale, how confident are you that you would be able to entirely abstain (or limit drinking to safe levels) f or the next 4 weeks?\" In addition to assessing beliefs about change that a re seldom made explicit in medical interviews, engaging patients in this dialogue provides a dditional information a bout drinking a nd consequences. This is true even when patients protest that they do not like to use number scales. Usually, asking why the number the patient chose is not LOWER than the number chose n encourages patients to voice their own thoughts about change in positive terms, smoothing a transition to talking about recommendations. ALCOHOL COUNSELING PRINCIPLES Alcohol counseling is a common task fa cing clinicians in office and hospital settings. The communication challenge requires that clinicians make recommendations f or patients whose perspective is at odds with the fa cts. Tailor plans in order to take account of the patient's readiness to change Medical problems bring people with alcohol use disorders into f requent contact with clinicians. Effective intervention and ref erral f or treatment requires clinicians to adopt evidence-\u00adbased counseling strategies. In general, the strategies parallel those used in other behavior change situations, but interactions are always complex because of the intensely diff erent perspective of clinician and pa tient. (3,13) Proper counseling mea ns creating a climate that is conducive to dialogue, responding to emotions, and adjusting conversa tions so that advice / recommendations are presented not only clearly but also consistent with patients' readiness to change. The following sections discuss the principles that underlie effective, compassiona te front line counseling for patients in trouble with a lcohol. The principles underlie all \"brief interventions,\" and apply whether the alcohol problems seem minor or severe. Some patients may need referral to aspecia lized setting. \"Brief Intervention\" \"Brief intervention\" is a specif term for 10-\u00ad15 minutes of counseling, with f eedback about drinking, personalized advice, and follow-\u00adup contact. Brief interventions, as studied in a variety of pra ctice settings, decrease alcohol intake and decrease the prevalence of at-\u00adrisk drinking by about 10%.(4,6,12,17,19) In long term follow-\u00adup studies of up to 16 yea rs, brief intervention decreased self -\u00adreported daily and binge drinking, as well as alcohol-\u00adrela ted mortality. Clinician interviewing styles that a re non-\u00adconfrontational a nd aimed at enhancing patients' motivation a re more effective at reducing (or stopping) drinking than confronta tional counseling. Brief intervention can be ef fective whether patients are ready to take action to change, are thinking about change, or seem dead set against change at the time of the interview.(13,18) Studies show that more than 75% of patients express some readiness to change and tha t readiness correlates positively with the severity of the drinking problem. These f indings contradict the common belief that severe drinkers are precontemplative. In f act patients with less severe problems are less likely to be interested in changing and likel y to benef it from concern-\u00adra ising brief interventions(2,24). Advice, reco mmend In every interaction, make clear and def inite recommendations. Then, negotiate specif ic goals and wa ys to achieve them. Express optimism. Avoid commanding or persuading, and do not force patients into \"a ll or nothing\" situations. For patients with a t-\u00adrisk alcohol use, recommend a drinking goal that conf orms to guidelines for safe use (NIAAA, above). For patients with a lcohol abuse or dependence, recommend abstinence. The \"pathophysiology\" section emphasizes the dynamics of denial. As preoccupation with alcohol progresses, many patients ignore reality, suppress negative feelings, and smoothly reject sound advice. For alcohol dependent patients, change seems unimagina ble, like jumping into a featureless abyss. Specif ic attention to these dynamics improves adherence. Give a dvice / recommendations with characteristics that are based on the extensive relevant literature (3,12,13,16): Base advice on expert opinion, facts and science, giving patients an objective ra tionale derived from a broader database than simply their case. Present recommendations explicitly, succinctly and clearly, even though experience shows that few patients will a ccept the advice. Stay in dialogue, listen to patients' perspectives and find common ground-\u00adexplore options until patients choose an a ction that is a step in the right direction. If none can be f ound, agree to disa gree, and continue the conversation a t subsequent visits. Do not let \"the best be the enemy of the good.\" A minima l action plan is to make a return visit, or perhaps to rea d a pamphlet from you, or keep a dairy or talk with a f riend or spouse. Advice / recommendation might sound like:\"Your weekend drinking is clearly a bove the saf e limits that the NIAAA a nd other experts advise. I recommend that we try to work out a plan for you to cut back to safe limits\" or, \"I recommend, based on data in the medical literature and my experience with experts who have advised me about simila r patients, that you stop drinking all alcohol. Of course, no one can be certain that this will work for you.\" or, \"Most people find tha t talking with people in Alcoholics Anonymous is help ful. AA might or might not be right for you. I recommend you go there.\" Next, ask patients what they think. Even when patients fa il to agree to an a ction step, conversations that do not provoke more resistance and negativity often prepare them for an action decision at a later time. Patients' reluctance and resistance often challenge clinicians' caring instincts. Clinicians may become hopeless and f ail to use constructive skills and strategies. Then, mirroring their patients' unwillingness to face reality, they may decline to intervene, leaving patients' problems unaddressed. Studies of successful interventions show that effective clinicians roll with resistance and remain consistently relationship-\u00adcentered by responding with empathy to irritability and defensiveness. Principles of behavior change co unseling (Modules 16, 24) a nd \"Motiva tional Interviewing\"(13) a applicable and helpful in their explication of stra tegies a nd associated skills. We illustra te these ideas in the following video, and discuss tactics for \"being clear but not demanding\" and for responding to reluctance with rela tionship-\u00adcentered empathic statements in the pages that follow the video. Create dialogue Avoid monologue by a lternating \"asking\" and \"t elling.\" As the encounter progresses, respond to resistance with reflection, and respond to agreement with \"telling\" more. Employ a format of \"ask, tell, ask.\"(Module 10) In this format, \"a sk\" means to inquire about patients' ideas, reactions and f eelings, and \"tell\" means to share facts a nd recommendations. Initially, ask for permission to discuss alcohol issues, then briefly \"tell\" (share) f acts and advice, and then ask about patients' responses-\u00ad this might include asking how they feel, what they think, or what they imagine to be next steps. Keeping \"telling\" brief helps clarity, and \"asking\" allows patients to choose \"change enhancing\" or \"change obstructing\" responses. Further, \"asking\" fosters exploration, choice and autonomy. The ma nner in which patients respond to inquiry about their perspectives on what clinicians \"ask\" or \"tell\" guides f urther counseling. Generally, \"change enhancing\" responses include statements of agreement, commitment or optimism; they suggest that further explora tion of the data and options might be helpf ul. Genera lly, \"change obstructing\" responses include disagreement, reservation, pessimism, defensiveness, non-\u00adcommittal statements, and questions that detour the dialogue; they suggest that clinicia ns should reflect back the \"obstructing\" response. Ref lection invites patients to look inside themselves, encourages motivation and may build discrepancy between time present and an improved future.(3,13) AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) Focus o n facts Minimize defensiveness and argument by sta rting with fa cts, rather tha n conclusions, opinions or authoritative statements. Create a climate of fact by giving information and recommenda tions in an objective or \"scientif ic\" way. Clinicians who in any way communicate, \"I know what is right for you\" provoke debate that is fruitless and a frustrating wa ste of time. \"Tell\" patients the relevant data about al cohol problems in a n impersonal way; such a s the following: \"Research shows that treatment helps;\" \"Having a high tolerance for alcohol means that a person is deprived of the early warning system that tells him to stop drinking before the alcohol level gets so high as to be dangerous;\" \"95% of men drink less than 35 drinks per week;\" \"Becoming sick in the morning until after a drink g enerally means a person's brain has become hooked on alcohol.\" Create a dialogue and relationship by \"ask\"ing the patient what he thinks about the relevant f acts. Patients also need to know about their own situation, a nd using numbers and \"scores\" (from rating scales, etc) encourages further discussion about the \"scientif ic\" and objective situation. Use language such a s the f ollowing: \"Three of your liver tests are abnorma l,\" instead of \"alcohol has damaged your liver;\" \"Your alcohol level when you arrived in Emergency wa s .160,\" instead of \"You were drinking heavily before you came to Emergency;\" \"You mentioned 3 important things, -\u00ad-\u00ad that your relationship with your wife is going poorly, that you are having stomach trouble, a nd that you lost your license to drive;\" instead of \"Alcohol is wrecking your marria ge, For patients with a t-\u00adrisk use, and others with mild alcohol abuse, many clinicia ns might wish to enhance off ice-\u00adba sed brief interventions with a dditional discussion a nd recommendations. Pharmaceuticals may be useful for withdrawal symptoms or craving. Set aside 30-\u00ad40 minutes for a longer visit. Ask the patient to invite a family member or friend to attend. Investigate the details a bout how drinking fits into daily life. Ask patients to list the positive and negative aspects of changing their alcohol use. This process produces a list of situations and triggers. Jointly problem-\u00adsolve and develop specific methods to cope with these situations. Patients can write in a diary or notebook and review it daily as a reminder to practice using new strategies. Celebrate even small successes a nd reframe \"failures\" as learning opportunities. See patients weekly or at fea sible short intervals for a time, to assure short-\u00adterm success a nd tailor strategies. For patients whose progress is unclear or non-\u00adexistent, make early referrals and frame the referral process in positive terms. In addition to treating medical complica tions (examples: trauma , liver problems, infections),clinicians can usef ully prescribe medications to help with dependence issues. (see \"Alcoholism Treatment and Follow up\") Adjust dialogue to readiness Clinicians who make effective interventions adjust their tactics, but not the basic recommendation, to patients' readiness to listen, think a nd take action. Because only the patient can ef fect change, the counseling task is to trigger change. Evidence shows that clinicians whose counseling a im is to build a sense of autonomy, optimism and confidenc e help trigger change.(3,12,13) Most learners (and practicing clinicia ns) do not suggest ideas and conscientiously check them to see whether they can be a djusted to patients' level of resista nce to change. When ma king suggestions, \"ask\" patients what they think about them. Importantly, do not present more facts to bolster the case for change, or try to persuade pa tients to adopt those suggestions. This strategy raises resistance and begins an enervating downward spiral that demoralizes patients and clinicians and assures poor a dherence. Below are example dialogues that highlight conversational adjustments for patients who seem uninterested in change, uncertain about change or ready to take actio n Uninterested: When a patient demonstrates little interest in changing, make a reflective statement that acknowledges this. Listen, and seek an action plan that suggests the patient take a closer look over time at the behavior and its ramifications. State that you are sufficiently concerned that you will bring it up again. \"We clearly have dif ferent perspectives right now. I appreciate that you do not intend to quit drinking . I wonder if you would be willing to think more a bout what makes me so concerned before your next appointment?\" Uncertain: Suppose a patient responds to inquiry and concern in a way that expresses uncertainty abo ut changing (or outright ambivalence) such as the following: \"Thanks f or your concern, Doctor; you know me pretty well, so I suppose there is some truth in what you say,\" A \"motivational\" intervention tha t could be employed is to make a reflective statement a nd ask for more dialogue: \"I apprecia te that you are thinking a bout this. Looking for your \"some truth\", would you be willing to review some good things about drinking as well as some not-\u00adso-\u00adgood thing s for me?\" Continuing, emphasize a utonomy a nd choice by saying, \"I'd value the chance to seek a deeper understanding of the total picture and help you make the best decision you can for yourself, as time g oes by.\" The general idea with patients not fully committed to quitting is to discern whether there is any a ction they might ta ke, short of actually stopping drinking. Ready fo r change: Occasiona lly, patients will be ready to take action, and seek advice from a trusted source. Such a patient might say, \"You know, a fellow at work has been pushing me to go to AA, and I almost wentwith him after I got my DUI.\" You might respond, \"It seems that we ag ree that it might be good to do something differently right now. Would you like to hea r my advice? ... ...In fact, from a medical and health point of view, my recommendation is that you quit drinking . Many people learn a lot about themselves when they go to a f ew AA meetings with an open mind. Would you be able to quit and go to an AA meeting weekly until I see you again in a month or so?\" Augment patients' confidence about change by stating their specia l and unique strengths. Tell the patient why he has a cha nce of success, based on facts a bout his unique chara cteristics, past successes, attitude, and other attributes. \"You've told me how independent, even stubborn, you can be and that may mean that when you decide to do something difficult, you can stick to it.\" AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) Alcoho lism t and fo llow up counseling is not \"treatment\" f or severely af fected patients. Specialized treatment and long-\u00adterm programs support patients with mutual-\u00adhelp, daily care, intensive counseling, and extended stays in \"ha lf-\u00adway house\" type facilities. Help patients f ollow through with referrals. Recommend a mutual-\u00adhelp group for patients with alcohol a buse or dependence.(3,11,16) Alcohol dependent patients may benefit from access to medical detoxification and multidisciplinary counseling opportunities. Severity of the drinking problem and consequences informs ultimate referral recommendations better than does the specific diagnosis of a t-\u00adrisk, abusive, or dependent use. Most people know a bout Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). Other mut ual-\u00adhelp a lternatives exist in many communities; two examples are Rational Recovery and Women f or Sobriety, but their success rates are less clear tha n AA's. B oth inpatient and outpatient treatment progra ms help patients initiate and continue contact with community based self -\u00adhelp, halfwa y houses, and intensive counseling. Many communities support specia l needs programs, such as for adolescents, women , and patients with psychia tric problems. Clinicians may choose to prescribe medication. Four are approved a nd effective, namely naltrexone, guidelines (16, pps13-\u00ad18) include valuable drug information as well as advice about improving adherence. Confirm patients' intention and commitment to follow through. Additionally, emphasi ze the need for support from specialist colleagues. Set up the appointment before patients leave the office. Assure patients tha t a referral letter will be sent. Let patients know that you will speak with the specia list and tha t you would like to participate in the treatment plan. As with all behavior change situations where patients do the work (no medical or surgical \"cure\" is a vailable) results are uncertain, but evidence shows that counseling makes a diff erence.(14,16) CONCLUSION Interventions for patients with an alcohol use disorder, whether on the mild or severe end of the continuum of severity, ca n make a difference in health-\u00adrelated outcomes.Recommendations should be clear, but the rela tionship-\u00adcentered dialogue of intervention varies according to patients' readiness to change. Alcohol use disorders exist on a continuum, and clinicians in hospitals and offices frequently a re patients' initial contact with potential treatment. Clinicians should attend to any clues a bout an alcohol use disorder. Early intervention makes a difference in health-\u00adrela ted outcomes, and there is no excuse f or delay. In particular, both waiting to be certain exactly where a patient lies on the continuum a nd thinking the patient is uninterested in changing should not delay an intervention. Progress may seem slow or non-\u00adexistent, but data show that persistence in making recommendations with rela tionship centered evidence-\u00adbased behavior change counseling skills saves lives and diminishes suffering. Working with patients with alcohol use disorders is sometimes discouraging and painf ul. Full scale treatment requires more resources tha n any one person can provide, so clinicians should recommend and foster patients' integration with networks of helpers like Alcoholics A nonymous and comprehensive treatment progra ms. BEHAVIOR CHECKLIST 1. Screening Follow up a positive \"Prescreen\" with either, \"how many times in the past year have you drunk 5 or more drinks in a day (f or men, or 4 for women or over 65),\" or the AUDIT or CAGE test. 2. Assessment / Diagno sis If screening is positive or any clue is present, ask about consequences a nd symptoms: Psychosocial symptoms (rela tionship, job or legal problems, role f ailure, other drug use, depression, a nxiety). Alcohol-\u00adspecif ic consequences (blackouts, arrests f or DUI/OUI/D WI, AA a ttendance, family history). Alcohol-\u00adspecif ic symptoms (tolerance, withdrawal, dif ficulty with control or cutting down, preoccupation, continued use despite consequences). Somatic symptoms (heartburn, trauma, insomnia). Use ref lections and empathic statements to respond to irritability, hostility, anxiety or defensiveness. Refrain from responding to distra cting questions. Assess readiness to change. 3. Advise / reco mmend Recommend abstinence f or patients' with alcohol abuse or dependence. Recommend a comprehensive treatment progra m, Alcoholics A nonymous, or other local facilities for patients with alcohol a buse or dependence. Use \"ask-\u00adtell-\u00adask\" stra tegy to present information and recommendations. When off ering information, feedback facts, not conclusions.Apprecia te patient strengths; support self-\u00adef ficacy, autonomy and choice. Use ref lections and empathic statements to respond to reluctance, resistance and ambivalence about change. Arrange follow up. REFERENCES 1. Bondy S , Rehm J, Ashley M, et al.

INTRODUCTION Substance abuse and substance dependence are commonly seen in patients in medical practices, and are frequently co-\u00admorbid with other medical and psychia tric disorders. Considerable societal stigma exists toward patients with substa nce use disorders; healthcare provider s frequently have negative attitudes toward these patients as well. Fortunately, there are established communication skills you can master that will f acilita te the establishment of therapeutic rela tionships and motiva te patients for treatment. Substance abuse and substance dependence have a 10.3% lifetime prevalence; yet, they are routinely underdiagnosed by healthcare providers. (2, 3) Approximately 20.1 million Americans age 12 a nd older used illicit drugs in the past month (8.0% of the population). (4) The prevalence of illicit drug use is 7 to 20% in ambulatory practices and up to 50% in trauma patients. (1) Psychiatric and physical co-\u00admorbidities are very common, and 60% or more of patients with substance use or dependence suff er from an additional psychiatric disorder.(4,5) In 2008, an estima ted 23.1 million persons age 12 or older needed trea tment for an illicit drug or alcohol use problem (9.2% of the popula tion over 12). Of these, 2.3 million (0.9% of the popula tion and 9.9% of those who needed trea tment and received it) received treatment at a specialty facility.(4) In addition to the health and socia l consequences, these high rates of use and of undertreated patients contribute to the staggering f inancial costs of substance use (illicit drugs and alcohol), which a re estimated a t $416 billion per year. These costs, do not, however, translate into treatment costs. For example, in 2003, only 1.3% ($21 billion) of total health care expenditures were for the treatment of alcohol and drug disorders.(6,7) People with substance use disorders are heavily stigmatized. Clinicians are not immune f rom negative attitudes about substance use disorders. The identification, assessment and referral f or treatment of patients are strongly influenced by clinician attitudes a nd life experiences with personal, f amily, or prior patients' substance use. Ef fective tools and strategies can help you recognize the physiologic and behavioral red f lags of addiction and elicit a substance use history in a nonjudgmental manner, so you can make the appropriate diagnosis and develop a patient-\u00ad specific plan for treatment and ref erral. (8) This educa tional module on the clinica l assessment of substance a buse disorders presents written text a nd instructional videos that provide the knowledge, skills, a nd attitudes needed in the screening, evaluation, and referral of patients with substance use disorders. The video exa mples in this module focus on prescription drug abuse, a common and increasing problem in clinical practice. However, the strategies f or screening and referral that we present are the same for all substance use disorders. For additiona l information on drug abuse and addictive disorders, please go to the National Institute on Drug Abuse's NIDAMED Web site: http://www.drugabuse.gov/nidamed / MEDICAL MODEL OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND SUBSTANCE DEPENDENCE Substance use disorders are complex chronic, relapsing and remitting diseases in bothpresenta tion and pathogenesis, lity. D espite the neurochemical changes and the chronic and relapsing nature of these diseases, treatment is effective and recovery possible. http://www.drugabuse.gov/scienceof addiction Substance use disorders are chara cterized by compulsive drug seeking and use despite harmful physical, psychiatric, and interpersonal consequences. (9,10) Substances of abuse alter brain f unction, impact many health conditions, and can lead to major public health problems, including the transmission of HIV, hepa titis, and tuberculosis. Steady use of psychoactive substances causes biochemical and structural changes in the brain that limit self control and result in substance abuse and dependence as defined in the DSM IV-\u00adTR (see text under the heading \"D iagnostic Criteria,\" below). Substances of abuse acutely activate and chronically dysregulate brain reward functions, largely via mesolimbic dopamine pathways. Brain-\u00adimaging studies show changes in both ana tomy and physiology in areas known to be critical for judgment, decision making, learning, memory, and behavior control. (11) S ee also http://www.drugabuse.gov/pubs/teaching/Teaching6/Teaching.html . \"Addiction\" is a commonly used but frequently nonspecific term. In this text, \"addiction\" is defined a s a chronic, relapsing brain disease, characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use despite known harmf ul consequences. It ma y include physical dependence, which refers to brain changes associated with daily substance use that produce noxious symptoms (e.g., gooseflesh, runny nose, hyper-\u00adalertness, sweating, tremor, confusion) when the person stops using (i.e., withdraws). Withdra wal is a powerful stimulus to use a gain, and the symptoms abate when use is restarted. However, physical dependence is not the same as addiction. Please click the video button on the left to watch Cliff, a Family Clinician, talking about his substance use and how he became addicted. Substance use disorders have a multi-\u00adfa ctorial etiology, including genetics (can account for 40-60%), biologic changes in brain f unction, a nd pre-\u00adexisting co-\u00admorbid A xis I psychia tric disorders. Family history, societal, and life events can also be important etiologic factors. However, most people who \"experiment\" with drugs or alcohol do not develop a substance use disorder. Please click the video buttons on the left to wa tch Michelle discuss how mental health issues led to addiction a nd Rhonda discuss the complex life circumstances that led to her addiction. Substance use disorders are a major co-\u00adfactor in societal violence. Substance use often begins in childhood or adolescence, when the brain continues to undergo dramatic changes. One of the brain areas still maturing during adolescence is the prefrontal cortex\u2014the part of the brain that enables us to assess situations, make sound decisions, and keep our emotions and desires under control\u2014putting a dolescents at increased risk for poor decisions (such a s trying drugs or continued abuse). Moreover, the immature brain may be particula rly vulnerable to chemical cha nges caused by psychoactive drugs, and therefore drug use may increa se the risk of abuse or dependence in adolescents and young adults. Adolescents who use alcohol or other psychoactive drugs also frequentlyhave academic and social problems, as well as encounters with the crimina l justice system. Symptoms of substance abuse, dependence, and withdrawal can mimic symptoms of major psychiatric disorders. Treatment works! Treatment enables people to regain control of their lives and countera ct the powerful disruptive eff ects on the brain and beha vior of substance a buse or dependence. Relapse rates for treatment of substance use disorders are similar to those of other chronic illnesses, like asthma or diabetes. Thus, substance use disorders should be treated like any chronic illness, with relapse serving as a trigger for renewed intervention. Diagno stic Crit eria To serve your patients well, you must know features that distinguish the substance use disorders from one another and fro m non-\u00adproblem-\u00aduse. More importa nt, you must take a ction when you a re concerned, even if you cannot make a definitive diagnosis. The D SM IV criteria f or distinguishing substance use disorders, including substance abuse, dependence, and substance-\u00adinduced disorders, are delineated in the next sections. The symptoms that practicing clinicians witness are frequently only the tip of the iceberg. Any concern on your part may indicate a more serious problem. Theref ore, take action a s soon as your screening protocols or the presence of any \"red flag\" suggests substance use problems. Refer a ll patients with evidence of a substance use disorder for further evaluation and possible treatment by a substance a buse professiona l. Substance abuse specia lists have the time and tools to make an exhaustive diagnostic inquiry; to distinguish between substance use, abuse, and dependence; and to adjust their interventions accordingly. Substance Use Diso rders and Substance Related Disorders The D iagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental D isorders, DSM-\u00adIV-\u00adTR (12), categorizes Substance Use D isorders and D isorders, and specif ies criteria for diagnosis: Abuse and dependence are maladaptive patterns o f sub stance use leading to clinically significant impairment o r distress, as manifest ed by persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal pro blems caused by subst ance use. The Diagno include: Substance Abuse: Maladaptive of substance use leading to clinica lly signif icant impairment or distress as manifested by one or more of the f ollowing social or interpersonal problems caused by use of substance, within a 12 month period: Recurrent substa nce use resulting in f ailure to fulf ill major role obligations at work, school or home. Recurrent substa nce use in situations in which it is physica lly hazardous Recurrent substa nce related legal problems.Continued substance use despite persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exa cerbated by the effects of the substance. Substance Dependence: Maladaptive pattern of substance use leading to impairment as manifested by three or more of the following in any 12 month period of time: Tolerance-\u00ad either 1) marked need to increase amounts of substa nce to achieve intoxication or desired eff ect or 2) markedly diminished ef fect with continued use of the same amount of substa nce Withdrawal-\u00ad either 1) characteristic withdrawal symptoms of a specific substance or 2) use of the same or similar substance to avoid withdrawal symptoms Substance taken in a larger amounts or over a longer period of time than was intended Persistent desire or unsuccessf ul effort to cut down or control use Excessive time is spent in a ctivities necessary to obtain the substance or recover from its eff ects Important social, occupationa l or recreational activities are given up or reduced Substance use continues despite knowledge of having persistent physical and/or psychological problems caused by the substance 2) Substance-\u00adRelated Diso rders include, but are not limited to: Intoxication Withdrawal Delirium and dementia Amnestic disorder Psychotic disorder Mood disorder Anxiety disorder Sexual dysfunction Sleep disorder SCREENING FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS A good clinical interview includes questions about substance use and sequelae of use across medical, psychiatric, personal, legal and social domains. Pay close a ttention to high risk or under recognized patients including pregnant women, young and older adolescents, older adults, Native Americans, health care providers, noncompliant pa tients, those w ith major psychiatric disorders and individua ls in the criminal justice system. Screen all new patients and reevaluate established patients periodically. D ata show that clinicians very of ten overlook substance use disorders. In one prima ry care study, clinicians reported a preva lence of substa nce abuse disorders of less than 1% of their patients despite an estimated substance abuse prevalence of 2%-\u00ad9%.(3) Place particula r attention on high risk patients with co-\u00admorbid medical or psychiatric disorders, including those with chronic pain, gastrointestinal complaints (abdominal pain), systemic infections including Hepatitis B and C, HIV/AID S, other STD's, bacterial endocarditis, pulmona ry disease, obesity, cardiovascular and cerebral vascular disease, trauma including motor vehicle accidents, gunshot wound s, and psychiatric symptoms including depression, a nxiety, and insomnia . (13) (see http://www.druga buse.gov/consequences )The assessment and mana gement of chronic pain presents complex challenges to the clinician. Some patients will come to clinicians having been treated with narcotics, and f eel they cannot function without them. It is important to remember that pain is a subjective sensation that is very rea l for the patient. Many f actors influence the processing of pain signals and the sensation of pain, including past life experiences, personality traits, f ear and anxiety, the meaning of the pain, depression, \"secondary gains,\" etc., in addition to any pathology that may be present. The f actors that contribute to a patient's perception of pain may need to be evaluated over severa l visits, sometimes with the help of a pain professional or psychiatrist. All patients with chronic narcotic use for painful conditions should be evaluated f or substance use and abuse disorders. If any o f the kno wn medical, psychiat ric, familial, yment, and legal flags\" are present (See next section on \"Red Flags.\"), a more detailed evaluation is needed to ascertain the presence of a substance use disorder and the patient' s readiness to accept treatment. When screening f or substance use disorders, include questions about both alcohol and drug use, which are f requently linked. Ma ny patients use more than one substance of abuse. Each should be explored. Ask specif ically about tobacco (cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco), alcohol (beer, wine, liquor), marijuana, cocaine/crack, methamphetamines, other stimulants, opioids (heroin and ied Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (NMASSIST) provides screening questions covering all drugs of a buse (specif ically separating out prescription drugs from similar street drugs).http://www.druga buse.gov/nidamed/screening Please click the video-\u00adbutton on the left to play Dr. Parran's Comment on screening. Studies show that \"subtle\" screening is not better than direct questioning. (16) Specif ic screening strategies include simple structured questionnaires, such as the CAGE-\u00adAID , adapted from the widely used CA GE questions for alcohol dependence. (17,18) With adult patients, start with a question about use: \"Do you use, or have you ever experimented with alcohol or other substances?\" If \"yes\", or if the a nswer is equivocal, f ollow with: Have you ever f elt a need to Cut Do wn on or Control your use of alcohol or other drugs? Have friends/f amily made comments to you about your use of alcohol or other drugs ... have those comments ever Annoyed you? Have you ever f elt bashful, emba rrassed or Guilty about thing s you have said/done when using alcohol or other drugs that you would not have said/done otherwise? Do you ever use Eye-\u00adopeners (drinking or using in the morning to \"get going\" or settle your nerves)?Please click the video-\u00adbutton on the left to play Dr. Parran's Comment on pa tients' positive responses to these questions. If any a nswer is positive, initiate a \"Brief Intervention\" (below), but before doing so, ask follow up questions, because the patient's responses to them will help you structure the particulars of your brief intervention conversation. Define patterns of use for each substance including the quantity, duration of use, frequency of use during that time, route of administration, ef fect of use, strategies used to acquire substances a nd cost. Explore periods of abstinence and triggers to use substances a long with associated physical symptoms. (18) One helpf ul strategy is to ask the patient about his/her perspectives and observations about their use and consequences. Helpf ul questions include the following: Do you ever think you use too much? Have you ever tried to cut down on your use? Have you needed to use more to get the same eff ect? Has use created any problems, e.g. medical, educationa l, job? Red Flags fo r Substance Use Diso rders Despite good interview skills a nd use of effective screening tools, many patients with serious substance use disorders escape identification in clinicia ns' offices. Attending to behaviora l and physical red flags will help you identify a significant subset of patients who would otherwise remain \"under t he radar,\" and thus not benef it from intervention. Patients with substance use disorders are often reluctant to reveal them. They may fea r negative judgments, be embarrassed about their inability to control their lives, or be in denial about the extent of their problems. In a variety of subtle or not-\u00adso-\u00adsubtle wa ys, patients eff ectively avoid disclosure. Their methods include not listening to question s; minimizing use or consequences of use; changing the topic; showing irritation, anxiety, or other symptoms that discourage f urther inquiry; blocking many facts f rom their own consciousness; and outright lying Please click the video buttons on the left to see what Reno and Rhonda have to say about interactions with their doctors. However, there may be signals that appear in an interview, during the physical exam, in prior records or in statements from signif icant others, office staff, or hospital staff, tha t raise concern about a patient's substance use. These \"red flags,\" whether mentioned by the patient, f amily, or another information source, should be an indication to follow up with the same diligence and persistence as you would after a positive drug screen or disclosure of heavy substance use, in order to ascertain the presence of a substance use disorder and the patient's readiness to accept treatment.Some common \"red flags\" a re in the bulleted list below. Physical findings: Alcohol on the breath, ascites, an enlarged liver, nasal ulcers or a perfora ted septum, excoriated skin (f rom scratching), track marks, skin abscesses, obesity or anorexia, abnormal gait, tremor, slurred speech, change in pupil size, injuries, chronic pain, bla ckouts, accidental overdoses, withdrawa l symptoms, other liver or gastrointestina l problems, premature labor, and vague soma tic compla ints. Mental sympto ms: Depression, anxiety, f lashbacks, insomnia, behavior, paranoia, irritability, vagueness, hallucinations, memory and concentra tion problems, and defensiveness about questions relating to substance use. Social Pro blems: Isola tion/withdrawal, loss of previous f riendships, marital difficulty including domestic violence, a nd loss of interest in prior a ctivities (e.g., sports, hobbies). Educat ion and emplo yment hist ory: School f ailure or poor gra des, job losses, and frequent job changes. Legal problems: D UI, assaultive or violent behaviors, stealing, drug possession, and prostitution. Family histo ry: May be positive for substance use or mental disorders; developmental problems in children. Clinician Attit udes All patients have the same huma n needs for feeling well, attachment to others, and sense of self-\u00adcontrol. Clinicians who have had difficult experiences with patients or others with addictive disorders may expect patients who have a substance use disorder to betray their trust and to manipulate them with drug-\u00adseeking behavior. These early experiences can lea d to persistent negative attitudes, including cynicism a nd hopelessness resulting in lack of empathy and poor or inadequate screening f or substance use disorders. These negative clinicia n-patient interactions can also adversely impact pa tients' willingness to discuss use and accept ref errals for treatment. (17) You can enh ance your care of patients with substa nce use disorders by ref lecting on your own attitudes a nd discussing them with colleagues, by increasing your knowledge about the medical nature of the disease and the effects of substance use disorders on patients' lives, and by practicing discussions a bout dia gnosis and treatment with patients who are f earful and discoura ged. Signif icant societal stigma still exists toward patients with substance use disorders despite signif icant advances in scientific knowledge, diagnosis, and treatment. (9,18) Remember tha t addiction is a disease of the brain and comparable to other chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, asthma, or hypertension, which also need ongoing monitoring and treatment. Lack of knowledge about clinical screening techniques and referral resources, however, increases clinicia n reluctance to evaluate patients for substance use disorders. Please click the video button on the left to hear Dr. Parran's comments about the benef its of honing skills in these challenging relationships. Anger toward patients, especially when they are noncompliant or relapsing, will only drive a wedge between the patient and clinician and exacerbate noncompliance. Negative clinicia n attitudes can be manifested in the way clinicians ask and respond to questions about substance use, e.g., \"You don't use drugs, do you?\" or in responding \"Good\" when a patient initially denies use. Addressing patients' drug-\u00adseeking beha viors respectfully and directly, in an empathic manner, while setting appropriate limits on requests for prescription drugs, will increase the possibility of engaging patients in treatment. Patients' behaviors may continue to be frustrating, but a positive attitude and belief in the possibility of recovery can energize patients. After all, many patients do recover, though it may be a long process and take several interventions. You can visualize frustrations as challenges to overcome, and feel compassion for pa tients' struggles. Learning and using effective communication strategies a nd setting relationship limits in a respectful and straightforward manner create a healing relationship. Your hope and respect give your patients both hope a nd a new measure of dignity. If patients feel that you won't give up on them, they may be less likely to give up on themselves. Respond to irritability and suspicion with interventions that reflect what you hear \"Many people are concerned about these questions.\" or \"I hear some concern or irritation in your voice.\" or \"I'm feeling a bit confused by your responses. Help me better understand what you are saying.\" When patients express irritation with your reflections or your limit-\u00adsetting, or a t their own shortcomings, here are some helpful responses for you to consider. \"I hear your f rustration that I will not prescribe more oxycodone for you\" or \"I understand your f rustration. Patients in recovery tell me tha t my firm limits were helpful in getting them into treatment; I hope that will be the case for you.\" or \"I hear your sense of hopelessness now, and I've heard so many people turn that around when they get into treatment.\" or \"I know you feel bad about fa iling to carry out the plan. But let's look at some of the details together and see if we can learn something that will help you succeed the next time.\" Physical Examination Prognosis f or recovery is better if diagnosis and intervention are made early in the course of the disease. Some physica l findings may be present in early stages of substa nce use disorders. Others, par ticularly the \"classic\" physical findings occur only in later stages. Injuries from accidents, or from altercations in the home or on the streets, may appea r early in the course of substance use disorders, and they are always cause f or active intervention. Other early clues include a lcohol on the breath; signs of intoxication such as abnormal gait, slurred speech, sedation, dilated or constricted pupils, excoria ted skin (from scratching), track marks, and skin abscesses; and behavioral symptoms such a s irritability, vagueness, para noia, and poor concentra tion. The e arlier a diagnosis is made, the better the prognosis. However, use over periods of years produces physical findings that ma ke diagnosis much easier. Some examples of physical symptoms and findings that ensue af ter persistent use include the following: Malnutrition, including cachexia, but also obesity Systemic infections including cellulitis, sexually-\u00adtransmitted diseases, HIV, hepatitis B and C, tuberculosis, a nd bacterial endocarditis Elevated blood pressure, tachycardia, chest pain, transient ischemic a ttacks, restlessness, sweating, a nd tremor\u2014f rom withdra wal Physical damage from administering a drug that involve chronic sinus/nasal problems, worsening bronchitis f rom marijuana or cocaine smoking, or \"track marks\" f rom injection drug use The myriad systemic ef fects of alcoholism, including delirium, liver enlargement or f ascites, a nemia, thrombocytopenia and bleeding, seizures, trauma, myopathy, and cardiomyopathy In pregnant women, abruptio pla centa, premature birth, low gesta tional size, and neonatal withdrawal syndrome Intervention may seem more difficult in later stages of the disease process, but many patients have suf fered enough by that time and are more ready to accept the diagnosis and referral f or treatment with experienced professionals. B e clear about a vailability and eff icacy of treatment, even af ter many years of destructive use; be respectful a nd compassionate; and be persistent with later-\u00adstage patients. For more information a bout specif ic medical consequences of substance use, please see http://www.nida.nih.gov/consequences/ Labo ratory Evaluation Lab testing has limited usefulness in the diagnosis of substance use disorders and in the discovery of a ssociated physical harm. Drug testing does not measure severity of the disease. However, testing to monitor drug use is a n important component of every treatment regimen. No specif ic laboratory test establishes an unequivocal dia gnosis of substance use disorder; however, blood alcohol levels may confirm tolerance, or detection of a nother drug may confirm the origin of coma or confusion. Routine laboratory screening including liver f unction tests, complete blood count (anemia from chronic gastritis or a slightly high Mean Corpuscular Volume [MCV] with excessive alcohol consumption), and vitamin B 12 and folate levels occasiona lly are the \"red f lags\" tha t stimulate further diagnostic inquiry.Blood alcohol levels, breathalyzer test results, urine drug screens, and, less commonly, hair and saliva analysis can be used to assess patients for possible alcohol and other drug use. A drug screen may be usef ul in evaluating a n adolescent with school problems, or in accidents, domestic violence, or other trauma situations. Performing urine a nd blood screens in some situations (e.g., school, employment) may be controversial, so it is a dvisable to obtain the patient's (and/or parents') permission before initiating such screens. Failure to do so can damage the clinicia n-\u00adpatient relationship and cause legal consequences f or the clinician. Blood, urine, and saliva studies add a crucially important dimension to the eff ectiveness of treatment progra ms. Testing adds structure and limits that are critical aspects of helping patients regain self-\u00adcontrol and self-\u00adrespect. AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) THE BRIEF INTERVENTION When clinical screening indica tes a potential substance use disorder, assess the patient' s readiness to change and conduct a brief intervention to fa cilitate treatment engagement. Take steps to determine the patient's willingness to accept the diagnosis and accept further explora tion, intervention, and referral for treatment. Prior to discussing treatment options, check patients' readiness to change their beha vior. Inquire directly about patients' interest in changing and about their confidence in accompl ishing change. In a brief intervention, you tell the patient your diagnosis and specif ic recommendations in a matter-\u00adof -\u00adfact and non-\u00adconfrontational way. You offer educational materia ls and choices about next steps, emphasize that any change is up to the patient, and convey confidence in the pa tient's ability to change his or her behaviors. You help the patient work out appropriate and doable next steps toward accomplishing your recommendations. Encourage the patient to regularly report progress toward his or her established goals. (18) You then make definite treatment recommendations, tailoring your conversation based on the patient's apparent readiness to take action. Acknowledge that the patient is the one who decides what to do and, in f act, does all the real work. Most clinicia ns find that telling patients of a diagnosis of addiction is a difficult task, a n uncomfortable example of \"giving bad news.\" The discomfort can a rise from a n incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of substance use disorders, f rom previous negative experiences with substance abusing patients, from negative judgments about the patient's behaviors (impulsivity or crimina l activity), a nd from a lack of practi ce with skills for this special type of doctor-\u00adpatient interaction. The f ollowing guidelines present ideas about the content of recommendations, the process of giving them, a nd some \"how to' s\" about skills f or responding to patients' reactions, as well a s information tha t may assist you in examining your own biases. Content o f a Brief Interventio n This section delinea tes the principles and rationale f or a brief intervention, along with sample dialogue for handling pa tients' denial and their norma l resistance to changing their beha vior that has progressed to the point that it controls their lives. D epending on severity, you will support positive lifestyle choices, recommend abstinence f rom illicit drug use, recommend thatpsychoactive prescription drugs be taken only as prescribed, and suggest referral to professiona l treatment. All intervention dia logue with patients should be direct empathic nonjudgmental When talking about next steps, present information without a lienating pa tients who may be ashamed, in denial, ambivalent, or resistant to change. The use of shame, guilt, threats, confronta tion, arguments, a nd arbitrary treatment plans is counterproductive a nd should be avoided. Express optimism about recovery and willingness to continue to work collaboratively with your patients. (18) NIDA Info-\u00adFacts for \"Understanding D rug Abuse http://www.nida .nih.gov/infofa cts/understand.html Non-\u00adpro blem use: For patients who are using substances but appea r to be at low risk of a substa nce use disorder, give them information about safe limits f or alcohol use, and acknowledge that the only reasonable advice about other drug use is not to use illicit substances and not to exceed amounts prescribed for any psychoa ctive prescription drugs. Continue to screen patients periodically to verify that they have not developed a substance use disorder. Substance use diso rders: Explicitly and clearly recommend that patients with substa nce abuse or dependence abstain f rom all illicit drugs. For patients with a co-\u00admorbid psychiatric disorder, help the patient find a qualified psychiatrist to prescribe and supervise the ta king of any appropria te psychoactive drugs\u2014it is particularly helpf ul if the psychiatrist is associated with a substance use disorder treatment program. Coordination of care is essential. D o not prescribe any psychoactive drugs for patients, unless they are active in a treatment progra m, and then only with specif ic guidance f rom that program; otherwise your prescriptions may not be effective, and they are likely to worsen patients' problems. Articulate your medical concerns and be specific a bout the patient's substance use and the related medical issues. Provide patients with written information f rom the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA ) about drug abuse disorders and steps they can take. It is important to convey that you believe they need the help of substance abuse professionals and that you would like to refer them to local treatment progra ms. Substance dependence: Recommendations f or patients who have progressed to dependence are essentia lly the same as f or substance a buse--abstinence and pa rticipation in local treatment programs. Office counseling is rarely useful f or patients who are not participating in other treatment activities and it unwittingly contributes to prolonging or worsening the dependent state. You may wish to follow up and support such patients, but leave the treatment to professionals. Under norma l clinical situa tions, you should not prescribe medications that drug-\u00addependent patients can abuse. Instead of prescribing, respectfully and calmly say \"no\" and continue recommending tha t the patient take advantage of specia list treatment. No matter how persuasive (or demanding) patients are, or how much you think a small dose of \"x\" might ease their suffering, we cannot emphasize enough this caveat. Patients w ho are drug dependent and require narco tic medicat ion for pain management fo llowing surgery o r trauma should be managed collabo ratively, by t heir surgeon/trauma clinician, dentist , and addiction t reatment pro fessional. The pat ient always needs t o be an integral part of the treatment team. AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text)Determining Readiness to Change When clinical screening indica tes a potential substance use disorder, take steps to determine the patient's willingness to accept the diagnosis and accept further exploration, intervention and ref erral for treatment. Prior to discussing treatment options, check patients' readiness to change their beha vior. Inquire directly about patients' interest in changing, and about their confidence in accomplish ing change. Researchers have found that patients go through a series of predictable stages in the process of changing unhealthy behaviors. Stages of change include: precontemplatio n, co ntemplatio n, preparation, act ion, and maintenance. (20) It is important to understand wha t stage your patient is in, since your counseling will need to address the patient' s particular needs and expectations relevant to that stage. Briefly, in Preco ntemplatio n, the patient is content with the behavior and doesn't see the need to change. In Co ntemplatio n, the patient understands tha t there are benefits of the behavior, but also risks and current negative consequences, a nd is thinking about changing the beha vior. In Preparatio n, the patient has decided tha t it is best to change the behavior, begins to gather informa tion on wha t it will take to change, and pla ns concrete actions necessa ry to change. In Actio n, the patient undertakes the necessary behavior, social, and environmental changes necessary. In Maint enance, the patient practices the many behaviors necessary to substitute f or the previous unhealthy behaviors and to a void restarting the previous behaviors. In Relapse, the patient restarts the previous unhealthy behaviors and usually returns to the contemplation stage. Please click the buttons \"Contemplation\", \"Action\", and \"Relapse\" in the graphic on the left to play video examples showing interviews of Ms. Anderson in these stages. Below are videos of actual patients illustrating maintanance. Please click the video buttons on the left to listen to Reno, George, a nd Cliff talk about how they remain in the stage of maintenance. Asking two questions about patients' co nvictio n and confidence helps you ascertain their motivational rea diness. Conviction assesses what patients believe about the importa nce of taking action, and confidence a ssesses what patients believe about their present ability t o adopt or change a behavior (despite obstacles or ba rriers.) The latter is often referred to as their degree of\"self-\u00adef ficacy.\" Ask patients to help you understand where they stand by using a numerical rating scale. \"On a scale of 0-10, how convinced are you that quitting cocaine is important?\" Not only will patients' answers to readiness questions alert you to ma terial not usually made explicit, but also many patients respond with more dialogue and useful information a bout the past and the present. This is true even when patients protest that they do not like to use number scales. Usually, asking why the number the patient chose is not LOWER than the one the patient named proves a helpful continuation of the dialogue. You ma y wish to incorporate this tactic in your B rief Intervention (below), perhaps saying, \"So you are at a \"6\" about thinking you need to quit cocaine; I' m wondering why you did not name a lower score?\" Asking about lower scores encourages patients to speak (and to hear themselves speak) about change in positive terms. You can then move more smoothly to talking about next steps. Frame your confidence question as follows: \"Let's suppose f or a moment tha t you were a 10, completely convinced that you should cut down or quit; on a 0-10 scale, how co nfident are you tha t you would be able to entirely abstain f or the next 4 weeks?\" If the patient chooses a low number, you might a sk, \"What would it take for you to get your confidence level higher, say to an 8?\" The patient may then suggest strategies that develop a greater sense of self -\u00adefficacy a nd hope. The narcot ic cont ract When patients come to you who are already taking narcotics f or chronic pain, it may be unclear that substance abuse is a signif icant problem. For these patients, it is helpful to be explicit about the circumstances under which you will prescribe narcotics. A sking your patient to sign a narcotic contract can be very helpful. The NID A Centers of Excellence for Clinician Inf ormation (CoE) http://www.nida.nih.gov/coe/coe.htm provide, amongst many other valuable resources, an example of a narcotic contract on page 8 -\u00ad 9 of http://www.nida.nih.gov/coe/pdf/preventing-\u00ad supporting-\u00addocs.pdf (provided by B oston University School of Medicine). In the video on the next pa ge, you can observe D r. Parran discussing a narcotic contract with a patient. AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) Dealing with Resistant Pat ient Behaviors Behavior change is diff icult for everyone. Patients' resistance to accepting a substance use diagnosis or treatment is frustrating and often contributes to clinicians' negative counter-\u00ad transference beha vior and defensiveness. Talking with patients who do not a ppear to want help enervates clinicians. In dialogue with a respectful clinicia n, some patients are prepared to accept their dia gnosis and a treatment ref erral. On the other hand, many do not initially. Clinicians who seek to understand patients' resistance to change can develop an effective treatment alliance. D uring ongoing conversations they can use their understanding of the nature of resistance to augment patients' intrinsic motivation and hopefulness and shepherd pa tients towards recovery. Patients suff ering from the disea se of substance a buse or dependence are ensnared in diverse traps that lead to emotional isola tion, irrational f ears, discouragement, and hopelessness, accompanied by a n overwhelming inner certainty that they are worthless and undeserving persons. Some of these traps include the following: Estrangement f rom family Loss of friends who are not part of a substance-\u00adusing subculture Daily life restricted to obtaining the substance, or to finding the mea ns to obtain it Large amounts of time recovering from the effects of use Criminal behaviors such as shoplifting, burglary or other types of stealing Daily small and large lies a bout feelings and about actions Negative interactions with healthcare personnel, pa rticularly around episodes of intoxication or injury Begging, plea ding, or wheedling f or their substance of choice, or any substitute that might stem the urge or craving\u2014f rom doctors, pharmacists, dealers, and other users Destructive episodes of unconta ined anger or impulsivity, resulting in violence to friends, family, or stra ngers such as pedestrians, people in other vehicles, or healthcare personnel Repetitively a nd abjectly poor performance of social roles such as parent, spouse or partner, worker, or citizen The psychological mechanism of denial, intrinsic to the disease process, may play a key role in the pa tient's inability to recognize the problem and seek treatment. Sporadic or binge users of psychoactive drugs can have even more difficulty saying, \"I can stop anytime.\" Shame and guilt based on reactions from f riends and family contribute to resista nce. When patients imagine their clinicia ns' negative response to discovering their involvement with substance use, their shame and guilt and need to stay hidden increa se further. A co-\u00admorbid psychiatric disorder can limit patients' ability to accept a diagnosis or participate in treatment. Substance use-\u00adinduced cognitive impairment can impede patients' understanding of the need for treatment and ability to follow through with trea tment. In concert with the patient and his or her family, develop a diff erential diagnosis as to why a patient is resistant to treatment. Rema in open to addressing the patient's concerns and resistances without confronta tion, and develop skills and strategies that eff ectively communicate your expertise and your concern. (21) For students attending universities with DocCom memberships, see also \"DocCom\" modul es 9 (Understands the patient's perspective), 13 (Responding to strong emotions), 14 (It goes without saying: Nonverbal communication in clinician-\u00adpatient relationships), and 29 (Alcoholism diagnosis and counseling). In the following example, the clinician addresses denial directly and uses \"reflection\" in a genuine attempt to understand and hear the patient's perspective. MD: Hmmmm. You are doubtful about my diag nosis of a substance use disorder. Patient: I really don't think I have a problem. I know I can stop at any time! MD: You are pretty certain that the relationship problems and health issues we have discussed do not come f rom your drug use. Patient: Well, I' m always stressed out with my crazy family, and my horrible boss. I justneed to chill out now and then. MD: I hear that even if drug use caused some of the problems, you need drugs to help you chill out. Have I g ot that right? Patient: I' m thinking you are way off, doc. MD: You know, as we speak, I get more worried about your health. I could be mistaken, but what you have told me about your situation and the way you are looking a t it as we talk sounds like what I have heard f rom others af fected by substance use before they got well. In medicine, we understand that this process is common, a nd we even have a name for it\u2014\"denial\". Perhaps I a m wrong , but I am deeply con cerned, a nd worry tha t the disease of substance a buse has taken control of your life. What do you think? Patient: Thanks f or your concern. What about my ra sh? it is really killing me. MD: I'll recommend an ef fective, simple trea tment for your skin. How can you and I work together to look out for your overall health, now and into the future? AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) TREATMENT OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS Treatment f or substance abuse or dependence requires specia list care from certified counselors or comprehensive community programs or mutual help groups. You shoul d understand the core principles of treatment, so you can best a dvise your patients. Prima ry care clinicia ns play a key role in identifying high-\u00adrisk patients and providing appropriate prevention counseling. When a ppropriate, f amily members should be engaged as well. Prima ry care clinicia ns also play a n essential role in referring patients for treatment. Convey to patients that substance use disorders are chronic, relapsing diseases tha t can be successfully trea ted and managed a nd that recovery is a long-\u00adterm process. Effective treatment needs to be individualized, a nd it includes psychosocial and pharmacological interventions. Treatment recommendations need to be staged based on patients' immediate treatment needs, e.g. brief intervention identifying the diagnoses for the patient, detoxification to manage withdrawal symptoms, residential or outpatient treatment, and 12-\u00adstep progra ms. Initial and brief interventions include discussions of the results of screening, advice about the need to change substance use behaviors, evaluation of patients' readiness to make change, negotiation of goals, scheduling of f ollow-\u00adup visits and referral for specialized substance use disorder treatment. Assessment a nd treatment for co-\u00admorbid psychiatric disorders are essential components of substance a buse treatment. Please click the video button on the left to watch George discuss his treatment. NIDA Treat ment GuidelinesThe Nationa l Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) recommends a of overa rching principles that ef fective substance use http://www.druga buse.gov/infofacts/Treatmeth.html 1. No single treatment is appro priat e for all individuals. Matching treatment settings, interventions, and services to each individual' s particular problems and needs is critical to his or her ultimate success in returning to productive functioning in the f amily, workplace, and society. 2. Treatment needs to be readily available. Because individuals who are addicted to drugs may be uncertain about entering treatment, taking advantage of opportunities when they are ready for treatment is crucia l. Potential treatment applicants can be lost if treatment is not immediately available or is not readily accessible. 3. Effect ive treatment at tends to multiple needs of the individual, no t just his or her drug use. To be effective, treatment must address the individual's drug use and any associated medical, psychological, social, vocational, and legal problems. 4. An individual's t reatment and services plan must be assessed co ntinually and modified as necessary to ensure t hat the plan meets t he perso n's changing needs. A patient may require varying combinations of services and treatment components during the course of treatment and recovery. In a ddition to counseling or psychothera py, a patient at times may require medication, other medical services, f amily therapy, parenting instruction, vocational rehabilitation, and social and legal services. It is critical that the treatment approach be appropriate to the individua l's age, gender, ethnicity, a nd culture. 5. Remaining in t reatment fo r an adequat e perio d of time is crit ical fo r treatment effectiveness. The appropriate duration for an individual depends on his or her problems and needs. Research indicates that for most patients, the threshold of signif icant improvement is reached at about 3 months in treatment. A fter this threshold is reached, additional treatment can produce further progress toward reco very. B ecause people often leave treatment prematurely, programs should include strategies to enga ge and keep patients in treatment. 6. Counseling (individual and/or gro up) and o ther behavio ral therapies are critical components of effective treat ment for addictio n. In therapy, patients address issues of motivation, build skills to resist drug use, replace drug-\u00adusing activities with constructive and rewarding non-\u00addrug-\u00adusing activities, a nd improve problem-\u00adsolving abilities. B ehavioral therapy also facilitates interpersonal relations hips and the individual' s ability to function in the family and community. 7. Medicat ions are an important element o f treatment fo r many patients, especially when combined wit h counseling and ot her behavio ral therapies. Buprenorphine and methadone are very eff ective in helping individuals addicted to heroin or other opia tes stabilize their lives and reduce their illicit drug use. Naltrexone is also an effective medication for some opiate addicts and some patients with co-\u00adocc urring alcohol dependence. (See also http://www.druga buse.gov/drugpages/buprenorphine.html and http://www.druga ). For patients with mental disorders, both beha vioral treatments and medications can be critically important. 8. Addicted o r drug-\u00adabusing individuals wit h coexist ing mental diso rders should have both disorders treated in an integrated way. B ecause a ddictive disorders and mental disorders often occur in the same individual, patients presenting f or either condition should be assessed and treated f or the co-\u00adoccurrence of the other type of disorder. 9. Medical deto xificat ion is only the first stage of addictio n treat ment and by it self does litt le to change long-\u00adt erm drug use. Medical detoxification saf ely manages theacute physical symptoms of withdrawal associated with stopping drug use. While detoxification alone is rarely sufficient to help addicts achieve long-\u00adterm abstinence, for some individua ls it is a strongly indicated precursor to effective drug addiction trea tment. 10. Treatment does no t need to be vo luntary to be effective. Strong motivation can facilitate the treatment process. Sanctions or enticements in the family, employment setting, or criminal justice system ca n significantly increase both treatment entry and retention rates and the success of drug treatment interventions. 11. Possible drug use during treatment must be mo nitored cont inuously. Lapses to drug use can occur during treatment. The objective monitoring of a patient' s drug and alcohol use during treatment, such as through urinalysis or other tests, can help the patient withstand urges to use drugs. Such monitoring also can provide early evidence of drug use so that the individual' s treatment plan can be adjust ed. Feedback to patients who test positive for illicit drug use is a n important element of monitoring. 12. Treatment programs sho uld pro vide assessment fo r HIV/AIDS, hepat itis B and C, tuberculo sis, and o ther infectio us diseases; and co unseling t o help pat ients mo dify or change behavio rs that place themselves o r others at risk o f infect ion. Counseling can help patients avoid high-\u00adrisk behavior. Counseling also can help people who are a lready infected manage their illness. 13. Reco very from drug addict ion can be a lo ng-\u00adterm pro cess and frequently requires multiple episo des of treatment. As with other chronic illnesses, relapses to drug use can occur during or af ter successf ul treatment episodes. Addicted individua ls may require prolonged treatment and multiple episodes of treatment to achieve long-\u00adterm abstinence and fully restored f unctioning. Participation in self-\u00adhel p support progra ms during and f ollowing treatment often is helpful in maintaining abstinence. AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) RELEVANT BEHAVIORS ASK: 1. Screen all patients f or past and present substance use. 2. If any use, ask \"CAGE\" questions for alcohol/drugs, or use NID A modif ied \"ASSIST\" questionnaire. 3. Ask about f requency of use. 4. Ask about method of administration. 5. Ask patients for their perspective on the current and potential consequences of drug use. 6. Ask patients how they acquire their substances, including how they can afford them. 7. Ask about past quit attempts, or attempts to cut down; including withdrawal symptoms, how long abstinent, etc. 8. Ask about current mood and any past mental health problems. 9. Ask patients if they are open to hearing tha t they might have a substance a buse problem and might need specif ic help for this. 10. Assess patients' conviction and confidence about their willingness to quit using. 11. Conduct interviews in a non-\u00adjudgmental way. (ie: Do not say, \"This is really a will-\u00adpower problem and you need to just quit! \" or make other statements that might induce judgment or shame.) TELL (Brief Interventio n):1. Tell patients that you a re concerned that they have a substance abuse problem, and need help to manage it. Talk a bout the potential negative impact of substance use on pa tients' health, family, employment, mental health and well-\u00ad being. 2. Recommend assistance / treatment, and speak succinctly about options: stop on their own, join a 12 step program, go to an addiction specialist, be ref erred to a treatment center. 3. If patients are on prescription narcotics, negotiate a trea tment contra ct with them. 4. Inform patients about the role of drug and alcohol testing in treatment monitoring. 5. Communicate that individual needs vary, and that treatment usually includes psychological, socia l, vocational, and biological interventions. 6. Make a supportive statement like, \"Recovery is usually a long-\u00adterm process and it may take years to return to full functioning.\" 7. Offer to communicate with patients' families. 8. State your willingness to provide continuing care to patients who abuse substances. ASK: 1. Ask patients if they are ready to accept a referral to treatment. 2. Ask patients about their reactions to the discussion. 3. Ask patients about their questions and concerns. Learner assessment questio ns: 1. Define the concepts of tolera nce and dependence. How do they differ? 2. What are the common medical co-\u00admorbidities of substance use disorders? 3. Define the key principles of screening and assessing substance use disorders in the primary care setting. 4.

What changes can you suggest in the healthcare system in which you pra ctice to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients with MUS? Key Principles: 1. MUS a re often understandable in the context of patients' personal histories and current life situations. 2. Only if the clinician shows empathic understanding of distress and suff ering -\u00ad despite frustration or slow progress - will patients with MUS respond to attempts to explain their symptoms or plan treatment. 3. Emphasizing specific steps in planning treatment improves disability, satisfaction and mental health, decreases narcotic use and lowers healthcare costs. Learning go als: At the co nclusion o f this mo dule, yo u will be able to : Describe steps required to establish a diagnosis of \"Medically Unexplained Symptoms\" (MUS). Establish and maintain eff ective relationships with patients with MUS. Assist patients with MUS in understanding their illness. Negotiate and agree on specif ic treatment plans with patients with MUS. Assist patients with MUS in making a commitment to actively pa rticipate in their care. WHAT DOES MEDICALLY UNEXPLAINED SYMPTOMS MEAN? The term \"medically unexplained symptoms\" (MUS) refers to symptoms that are not adequately expla ined by the presence of organic disease or pa thology, even af ter an appropriate work-\u00adup. Patients with MUS are in emotional distress, and caring for them is diff icult or imposs ible if clinicia ns ignore or f ail to respond to tha t distress. Medically Unexplained Symptoms (MUS) refers to physical symptoms tha t occur without demonstrable organic disease. In patients with demonstrable organic disease, \"MUS\" refers to symptoms tha t are out of proportion to or inconsistent with the organic disease. Patients with MUS are a heterogeneous group [1], with a spectrum of presenta tions ra nging from mild to severe. In primary ca re, MUS is the primarymanifestation of emotional a nd psychological distress that is unrecognized by the patient. In a national survey, 72% of patients with emotiona l disorders presented to their clinicia ns complaining of physica l symptoms.[2] Unfortunately, most doctors ignore or fail to respond to patients' verbal and nonverbal cues and to their silent cries for emotional support. [3] The term \"MUS\" is often used intercha ngeably with \"somatiza tion,\" a term that has been defined a s \"the expression of emo tional discomfort a nd psychosocial stress in the physical language of bodily r term, \"f unctional somatic provoked reactions f rom pa tients, clinicians, and researchers [6-\u00ad14]. However, the idea of MUS does not preclude the possibility of underlying explanatory pathophysiologic changes, nor does it preclude that improved scientific understanding in the future could provide organic disease explanations f or some of what we now call MUS. MUS should also not be confused with Soma tization Disorder, wh ich describes a very sma ll specif ic group of patients with MUS. The present day understanding of MUS compels clinicia ns to focus on from emotional distress. Healthcare providers for MUS patients express frustration, disma y and a sense of helplessness in caring f or patients who have what they perceive as \"no real disease.\" [15-\u00ad17] Wrongly assuming that patients want multiple diagnostic evaluations, they unwittingly promote f urther somatization by f ocusing on symptom diagnosis and alleviation, while ignoring psychosocial cues. [3, 18] Tools for alleviating suff ering are described below. MUS IS COMMON AND EXPENSIVE Every clinician (particularly in primary care settings) sees many patients with Medically Unexplained Symptoms. Puzzled or worried clinicians frequently ref er patients to specia lists, and s uch referrals result in f requent diagnostic tests and very high medical expenses. Physica l symptoms, such as headache, pain, itching, or swelling are a common human experience. These symptoms a re often self-\u00adlimited and ignored by most people, even though their cause is usually unexplained. Some people are concerned enough to visit a clinician for their symptoms. Examination documents organic disease co nsistent with the symptoms in only a minority of these ambulatory patients, and most unexplained symptoms do not present a signif icant problem. In a small but significant minority of patients, MUS manifests as persistent symptoms that remain unexplained even af ter extensive and thorough evaluation. One investigator estimates the yearly healthcare costs for MUS patients at over $256 billion. As patients with MUS seek to ease their suffering [19, 20], the resulting utiliza tion of healthcare resources is expensive and ultimately fruitless. Patients with persistent MUS report more distress and impairment than similar patients with organic disease [21]. Patient suff ering is f urther exa cerbated by skepticism and distrust in both their healthcare [22] a nd personal relationships [23]. The prevalence of persistent MUS ranges from 1% -\u00ad33% depending on the setting and definition used [24-\u00ad26]. According to Katon et al, 25-\u00ad75% of visits to primary care clinicians were primarily due to MUS. [27] Specialists recognize MUS, and give various labels to the symptoms [27]. Some common designations are as f ollows: fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic pain syndrome, chronic fa tigue syndrome, somatof orm diso rder, non-\u00adca rdiac chest pain, non-\u00adepileptic seizures, and conversion disorder. (see below). SEVERITY OF MUS SYMPTOMS Patients with MUS may have mild symptoms or very severe and persistent ones, and clinicians seldom make the MUS diagnosis, leading to high costs. Patients with severe MUS experience dysfunction in many life domains, and often have a concomitant psychia tric disorder. A well recognized limitation of the literature on MUS is the lack of a unified standard definition and classification. [28] Nonetheless , the following classification seems useful in helping clinicia ns to recognize MUS a nd initiate appropriate treatment. [29] Mild MUS Patients with mild MUS experience f ew unexplained symptoms (usually one or two) tha t last from days to weeks and lead to modestly high healthcare utilization. [24, 29, 30] Clinicia ns seldom make the diagnosis of mild MUS because patients' symptoms a re self-\u00adlimited. However, instead of further listening in an a ttempt to understand the full story of the symptoms, clinicians often substitute diagnostic tests. It seems likely t hat factors such as \"stress\" and \"worry\" generate patients' symptoms, but patients with mild MUS have not been systematically studied, [31, 32] perhaps because they probably make up 80% of all MUS cases in clinical settings, [29] and if clinicians were able to establish this dia gnosis a nd provide interventions that we discuss below , many laboratory tests, unnecessary treatments and iatrogenic complications could be eliminated. Moderate MUS Perhaps 15% of all MUS patients in clinical settings have more than 2 unexplained symptoms that endure 1 to 6 months. S uch patients with moderate MUS average 8 or more visits a year and undergo extensive testing for their unexplained symptoms. [34] An estimated 20% or more of patients with moderate MUS have psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, dysthymia or substance abuse. [29] They express worries about persistent unexplained symptoms, and many believe they are in poor health. [35] Many patients with moderate MUS have psychological dys function that does not meet criteria for a specif ic diagnosis, a nd present a significant challenge f or their clinicians. [36] Severe MUSPatients with severe MUS -\u00ad perhaps 5% of a ll MUS patients -\u00ad have multiple unexplained physical symptoms that endure more than 6 months, result in functional impa irments and lead to very high testing and referral costs [37] If primary care clinicians recognize that a patient has severe MUS, they usually lack confidence in their ability to care for that patient. More frequently, clinicia ns mis s the diagnosis, perceive severe MUS patients as \"dif ficult,\" and order unproductive tests and consultations. Studies suggest tha t two thirds or more of patients with severe MUS meet diagnostic criteria f or a psychiatric disorder. [38] Investigators studying severe MUS have made the psychiatric diagnoses of \"Somatoform Disorder\" (includes hypochondriasis, conversion disorder and somatization disorder) or medical diagnoses of \"Functional Somatic Syndromes,\" (including fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, multiple chemical sensitivities, sick building syndrome, a nd Gulf War syndrome). However, the validity of these diagnoses has been questioned because of signif icant overlap in symptom criteria. [4, 33, 39] WHERE DO MUS SYMPTOMS COME FROM? The tools of biomedicine fail to explain the MUS illness process. However, adding the tools of psychodynamics, personality styles, neurobiology and behavior to those of biomedicine - producing the biopsychosocial model - makes possible an understanding of symptom origins and the plethora of patients' disabilities and dysfunctions. The fa ilure to explain the origin of physical symptoms puzzles clinicia ns and dismays patients. [40] Western cultures' a cceptance of a mind-\u00adbody duality demands that clinicians expla in what broken body part or system produces symptoms. The duality drives patients' search for legitimate sick roles to access support (\"how ca n my doctor and I f ix this broken part?\") Experiments support the \"gate control\" theory that provides an overarching biological explanation for unexplained symptoms. This suggests that long-\u00adterm cortical representations of factors such as family dynamics, socio-\u00adcultural influences, past trauma , and prior interactions with providers (see details below) modula te a \"gating\" mechanism in the substantia gelatinosa in the dorsal horn of the spina l cord. On balance, these central representations lead to less inhibition (a more \"open gate\") for centrally directed pain impulses (and other impulses) ascending through the spina l cord. While the ordinary person has greater inhibition and feels little pain, the unfortuna te MUS patient has less inhibition a nd more symptoms. The \"open gate\" makes it more likely tha t pain and other symptoms become more expected and anticipated. The recurrent anticipation and expectation of pain generates a chronic stress response that produces the suff ering experience of the MUS patient. According to recent exper imental data, the cortical representations act through a central pain matrix consisting of areas of the orbitofrontal and somatosensory cortices, thalamus and limbic system via multiple neurotransmitters. The following short paragraphs present research and scholarly thinking about ea ch of the biopsychosocial dimensions that \"cause\" MUS symptoms a nd distress. Engel [41] eloquently described psychodynamic theories; whose basic premise is that patients' symptoms are symbolic and express an underlying and unconscious conflict. A common scenario is a patient whose symptoms represent punishment; and thus serve to ease unconscious feelings of guilt. Some perso nalit y traits or styles predispose to development of MUS. [41-\u00ad43] Histrionic or passive-\u00adaggressive styles, for example, are associated with MUS, and may promote misinterpretations of norma l body sensations or excessive worry; personality disorders such a s borderline persona lity sometimes accompany severe MUS. Neuro biologists think that abnormalities within central nervous system pathwa ys for sensory impulses (particularly for pain) alter patients' perceptions and cognitions of bodily symptoms that occur norma lly in everyone. [44] Changes have been found in peripheral nervous f unction associated with viscera l hypersensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome [45], and in autonomic and neuroendocrine f unction in f ibromyalgia . [46] Alexithymia, or the inability to express emotions in words, may be neurologically based, as are the depressive syndromes, and both show f eatures of somatization. [47] When depression responds to medications physical symptoms often abate. Behavio rists maintain tha t behavior is often unconscious, adaptive and perpetuated by environmental f actors. S omatization behaviors might be an adaptation to fa mily dynamics or social f actors such a s need f or recognition or financial compensation. Some adaptive behaviors ma y be helpful initially but cause problems such a s MUS syndromes if they persist.Cultures a ttribute specif ic meanings to symptoms, a nd the associated belief s and attitudes lead some patients to generalize and dramatize somatic complaints. [47, 48] Violence, particularly sexual a buse, is strongly associated with moderate to severe MUS. Among women with chronic pelvic pain and functional gastroenterological disorders and in patients with chronic pain disorders the frequency of past abuse is as high a s 50%. [49, 50] Neurobiological, [51] behaviora l, cultural and psychodyna mic mechanisms likely contribute to this association. For women in abusive re lationships symptoms reduce the abuse (an abuser refrains from mistreating his ill partner). At the same time symptoms may serve as a \"cry for help,\" and allow her to seek ca re and emotional support f rom a clinician. Discard mind-\u00adbo dy duality When patients and clinicians think and work as if mind a nd body are separate, not only do symptoms worsen and costly interventions increase, but also clinicians' sense of competence diminishes. The clinician should help patients understand that symptoms derive f rom many sources, that seldom does an identifiable single cause or \"broken part\" exist, that efforts to distinguish \"mind\" contributions to symptoms from \"body\" contributions are fruitless and that the clinician will strive to help the pa tient f unction well in spite of symptoms. Research shows that diagno stic interviews become therapeutic conversations when clinicia ns empathetically introduce current scientif ic thinking about the importance of mind-\u00adbody connections to symptom development in \"Western\" terms. Patients are more likely to disclose the full panoply of symptoms a nd their psychosocial context. Further, the strategies that we describe below assist in the resolution of mild MUS symptoms, minimi ze or prevent the escalation f rom a \"moderate\" syndrome to a \"severe\" one, and help patients live fruitf ul lives despite symptoms. DIAGNOSIS OF MUS When patients complain of multiple symptoms of equal importance in unrelated body systems, think of MUS. S pend time on psychosocial history, repeat physical exams, and postpone intensive testing. As outlined in Modules 5 and 7, clinicians should open every interview by surveying problems and setting priorities for addressing them. However, when surveying and priority setting seems exhausting and strenuous and patients compla in of multiple symptoms of equal importance in unrelat ed systems, consider MUS syndromes. Then, spending time on a thorough psychosocial history may reveal important clues. For example, symptoms may begin or worsen during a stressful time, such as the loss of a loved one, a job, a dream -\u00ad or on the anniversa ry of an important loss. Ask directly, \"How stressful is your life these days?\" \"What worries you most about (the symptoms). \"What do you think (the symptoms) mig ht mean?\"Find out about chaotic or conflicted relationships. A sk if physical or sexual abuse ever occurred or is present in their lives. Ask about past or present substance abuse, or self-\u00ad medication attempts to lessen symptoms. Perhaps a co-\u00adworker just died with similar symptoms? Each of these factors contributes to worrying, adds to distress about wha t symptoms might mean, and contributes to possible amplification of the symptoms. In the absence of physical f indings related to the symptoms, obtaining simple screening laboratory tests is appropria te. Wait f or these results, talk with patients about them, and repeat the physical examination. Symptoms of mild MUS may diminish as time passes and the clinician repetitively uses words and nonverbal strategies to express concern and caring. Repeat examinat ions, no t tests Repetitive thorough examination is therapeutic f or patients with MUS. In dra matic contrast, repetitive and vigorous testing delays diagnosis and harms patients with MUS. MUS is a preva lent disorder. In cases where symptoms persist, a rare or elusive disease such as Wilson's disease, multiple sclerosis, Lyme disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, porphyria, or celiac sprue may be present. Patients with certa in diseases-\u00ad for example, carcinoma of the head of the pancreas, subdu ral hematoma, or ulcerative colitis may have prominent psychosocial features. Remember that moderate to severe MUS is far more prevalent than the disea ses with which it may be confused. Clinicians must sometimes live with uncertainty for extended periods. However, during repeated examination, patients who have another disease usually develop additional symptomatology or physical f indings. The repetitio n of careful physical exams and symptom reviews not only reassures clinicians, but is therapeutic for patients with MUS. Testing never outperforms careful thinking and carefully repeated examinations in the detection of rare and elusive diseases. Refrain from repeating tests when the proba bility of negative results is high. Adding new tests, especia lly invasive tests or consultations, may worsen the symptoms of MUS patients. As time passes, carefully record ideas and interventions. Without meticulous documentation, clinicia ns are tempted to repeat unnecessary and negative tests and also fa il to make interventions that ma y help the patient with MUS. It is likely that the sooner appropriate interventions are begun, the more likely patients with MUS a re to stabilize or improve. Co-\u00admorbidities wit h MUS Many patients with modera te to severe MUS a lso have co-\u00admorbid conditions, such as symptomatic organic disea se, psychiatric disorder, substance abuse or personality disorders. Trauma, personality f actors and psychologica l stress not only contribute to the development of MUS, as described, but also to the genesis of other disorders, particularly mental health conditions. Co-\u00admorbid organic illnesses such as coronary disease, a neurological disorder, or complicated surgeries exaggerate the effects of the above factors. Patients may be in relationship with other prof essionals, including alternative medicine providers for these conditions. Clinicians should coordinate theirefforts with those other providers. Organic disease Symptomatic organic disease: Patients with symptomatic organic disease who also develop MUS pose both dia gnostic and treatment challenges. For exa mple, the patient known to have epilepsy may a lso have non-\u00adepileptic seizures tha t would properly be recognized as part of an MUS disorder. The patient with coronary artery disea se may have non-\u00adcardiac chest pain and not be appropriately treated for MUS. When patients with MUS develop a new disea se such as pulmonary embolism or appendicitis, continue MUS treatment in para llel with other interventions; otherwise, excessive testing and potentially harmf ul invasive treatments f or other conditions will ensue. Psychiatric Disorders Depression: Many patients with MUS do meet criteria for a parallel diagnosis of depression. Both disorders require treatment. Depression treatment may reduce the number of somatic concerns, but is not treatment for MUS. MUS treatment should continue simultaneously. Note that undiagnosed depression is not the same as MUS. Panic Disorder: Panic disorder frequently accompanies MUS. Clinicians must a sk about panic attacks (Module 26). Effective treatment of co-\u00admorbid panic disorder dramatically reduces symptoms in patients with moderate to severe MUS. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder: Post tra umatic stress disorder (PTSD ) is associated with MUS, and some reports show that severe MUS could be 90 times more likely in people with PTSD than in those without. [52]In exploring the depth and breadth of patients' symptoms, be alert to hints a bout pa st or present traumatic situations, such as abusive relationships (Modules 28, 13), cult membership or service in a war zone, and seek consultative help. Substance Abuse and Perso nality Diso rder Substance Abuse: Co-\u00adexisting a buse of substances such as alcohol, benzodiazipines, narcotics, or street drugs is frequent in patients with MUS, especia lly in those with chronic pain. Interventions for MUS will surely f ail unless substa nce abuse problems are managed in parallel. Many \"red flags\" signal a co-\u00adexisting substance use disorder, and include the following: a) more concern about the drug tha n the problem, b) claims of multiple medication sensitivities, c) claims of inability to take generic drugs, d) refusal to engage or follow up with diagnostic work-\u00adup or consultation, e) sophisticated knowledge of drugs, f) claims by the patient tha t you are the only one tha t can help him or her, g) claims of lost prescriptions. (Modules 29 and 30) [53] Always obtain consultation and refer patients with MUS a nd substance use disorder to a community resource. Personality Disorder: One of two signal events may indicate the presence of personality disorder in patients with moderate to severe MUS. The first is failure to stabilize or improve with use of the communica tion and interaction strategies we outline above and below. The second is when patients' attitudinal and behavioral problems extend beyond preoccupa tion and worry about somatic symptoms to a broad range of personal and social situations. Treatment f or personality disorder is not in the purview of most clinicians in practice. Obta ining consultation or co-\u00admanaging with psychiatrists ca n greatly help in coping with patients' challenging styles and painful, distressing beha viors.MANAGEMENT: MILD MUS MUS is the prototype illness in which the clinician is the treatment. (Module 3) [54] Effective management de-\u00ademphasizes technical interventions in favor of relationship-\u00ad building strategies. This is not intuitive for clinicia ns who seek to \"find the broken part and fix it\". Clinicians who explicitly display sensitivity to the intensity of patients' suffering facilitate the resolution of mild MUS symptoms. Experience shows that many 21st century clinicians -\u00adperhaps even most of them-\u00ad f ind that attending to the somatic aspects of patients' distress is easier tha n encouraging patients to describe the feelings components of somatic symptoms and then responding empathetically to those emotional a spects. This is not surprising, as they live in a system dominated by mind-\u00ad body dua lity and intensive use of technology and procedures. The somatic emphasis is a serious problem because empathetic exploration of both aff ective and somatic symptoms during \"history taking\" contributes strongly to \"treatment,\" producing diminished suff ering and symptom resolution. Further, mounting evidence suggests that a predisposed patient may be \"turned into\" a \"somatizer\" if the clinician minimi zes or fails to recognize verbal and nonverbal cues to the emotions that signal the intense suffering. [55] Becoming effective with predisposed patients or those with a diagnosis of \"mild MUS\" requires bringing together certain communication principles outlined in prior modules. The Modules most relevant are Modules 5, on patient-\u00adcentered interviewing, 9 and 15, on patient perspective a nd culture, and 6, 13, and 14, on relationship building and non-\u00adverbal communication. Full exploration of not only physical symptoms (\"bio-\u00ad\"), but also the full emotional and socia l context (\"-\u00adpsychosocial\") assists in the resolution of mild MUS symptoms, the attenuation of moderate symptoms, and the prepa ration of more seriously af flicted patients for structured interventions (see MGMT: Ma jor MUS, below). Ignoring or minimizing patients' suffering delays symptom resolution. Dr. Smith highlights the therapeutic ef ficacy of these basic skills in the following videos that show a patient with dif ferent symptoms at off ice visits several months apart. MANAGEMENT: RELATIONSHIP Both clinicia ns and patients are often trapped by clinician inability to \"fix a broken part\" when no \"cure\" exists for the symptoms. Demands and def ensiveness mount, leading to challenging interactions, broken relationships and clinicia n burnout. Some patients with MUS believe tha t a body part is broken, that a really competent clinician would find a cure (drug or surgery), or that caregivers should not \"mess with\" their minds. Typically, neither pa tients' belief systems nor their symptoms respond to rational explanations or simple remedi es, so frustration and distrust ca n mount for both patient and clinician. Clinicians often experience patients as unwilling to cooperate with suggestions and simultaneously as making unreasonable demands. While helping patients become active participants in their care is always an issue, it often seems an impossibility with MUS patients. Lack of progress is not due to patients' willful refusal to participate, but to both the dynamics of MUS development and the inevitable communication dif ficulties. Clinicians who f eel discouraged and frustrated a re unable to express genuine empathy and sta yin relationship. They may adopt maladaptive behaviors such a s avoidance, inappropriate jesting, or being overly controlling or inappropriately passive. These dynamics inescapably lead to negative emotiona l reactions that are harmful to patients and contribute to clinician burnout. Effective management requires not only that clinicians reflect on their feelings, but a lso that they stay attuned to patients' suf fering. Many simple empathic sta tements can help build relation ships with patients, and we list some helpful ones below. Most clinicians will have to both practice them in saf e settings and also explore their feelings about \"uncooperative and demanding\" patients bef ore they are able to use them. Consulting with colleagues will also help avoid making situations worse. \"I will do my best to help you to feel better.\" \"I am impressed that you can work (or, \"get ou t and around\" or,\" make it to the office\", etc) with the symptoms you have-\u00ad you have a strong constitution.\" \"you and I have diff erent ideas about why you have these symptoms; let's talk about them together.\"\"I sense your f rustra tion that I'm not ordering another MRI at this time.\" \"Let's talk about how you can f unction better with treatments for this pain that do not involve drugs like oxycodone, whic h would not be appropriate for me to prescribe.\" \"You are worried that your condition might be serious.\" \"I can see how you would feel so distressed.\" \"I see you've been through a lot. Thank you for sharing so much about your situation with me.\" Set limit s; focus on functio n, not sympt oms Empathic establishment of certain limits and a steady emphasis on function rather than symptoms a lso helps to combat relationship challenges raised by the \"no cure\" dynamic. Clinicians who plan regular, time-\u00adcontingent visits -\u00ad rather than ad-\u00adhoc visits based on compla ints -\u00ad show more interest in the patient than in the symptoms. A regular schedule f acilitates a stronger f ocus on improvement in f unction than a change in symptoms. See patients weekly until they stabilize and begin to make progress. Progressively len gthen visit intervals as tolera ted, and shorten visit intervals during times of crises. To avoid reinforcing patient crises, discourage unscheduled visits and instead supplement regular visits with 3 to 5 minute phone calls or short emails. Establish a consistent visit routine. Once a diagnosis of MUS is established and an initial plan developed, limit follow-\u00adup visits to 10-\u00ad20 minutes. Start with a brief, open-\u00ad ended, patient-\u00adcentered update that focuses on the elements described in Management: Major MUS. Physical exam, even a limited one, is highly valued by patients, and should never be neglected. Monitor f or potential new diagnoses and integrate the treatment of co-\u00admorbid chronic disea se like diabetes and hypertension with the treatment of MUS. Remember that patients with MUS a re a heteroge neous group [1], and remember that combating societal emphasis on mind-\u00adbody duality in the service of improving patient function constantly cha llenges the most competent and empathic clinicia ns. MANAGEMENT: MAJOR MUS Patients with moderate or severe MUS a re extremely concerned, angry, or sad about their symptoms, and often demand tests a nd procedures. Successful management requires specific protocol interventions -\u00ad in a ddition to empathic responsiveness -\u00ad in order to generate a beneficial and ef fective partnership. As noted previously, being alert a nd responsive to clues that patients give as they describe physic al symptoms is a primary aspect of preventing the development of MUS in predisposed people, and of treating those with mild MUS. Clinicians who f ail to continually acknowledge the emotional aspects of patients' suffering not only delay symptom resolution, but worsen the situation. This occurs whether clinicians' non-\u00ad response to the emotional aspects is conscious or inadvertent. No patients who sen se -\u00ad consciously or unconsciously-\u00ad the lack of response to their suffering will be able to cooperate in a ctive treatment. The old sa w \"We are ruled by our emotions,\" dictates that these patients will \"doctor shop.\" They go on to the next clinicia n with intensified distress, distrust a nd demands. They mistrust clinicians because so many encounters lack empathic acknowledgment of their distress. Effective clinicians ma ke special ef forts to listen a ttentively and accept patients without judgment or prejudice. In spite of patients' anxiety, sa dness and demanding demeanor they are genuinely curious a bout how patients manage suffering and seek to fully understand their patients' life situation. When patients question clinicians' competence and ideas, these clinicians respond to the challenges non-\u00ad defensively and negotia te and compromise rather than demand and order. [56] They are willing to advocate for patients, but they eff ectively set limits (above) and are aware of professional boundaries (Module 41). They of ten and repetitively make statements like those in Manag ement: Relationship, above. Some specific communica tion skills that assist in the resolution of mild MUS symptoms, the attenuation of modera te symptoms, a nd the preparation of more seriously af flicted patients for interventions in the \"Major MUS Protocol\" below, include the following: Respond to both clues about f eelings or overt expression of feelings with empathic statements (Name the feeling, show you Understa nd the feeling, Respect the feeling, Legitimize the feeling, express Pa rtnership and Support the patient. ) Details in Modules 5, 6, 13 and 14. Conduct a careful and thorough exploration of the physica l symptoms themselves-\u00ad the \"biomedical aspects.\" Details in Modules 5 and 8. Explore the full emotional and social context and patients' perspectives about origin and treatment of symptoms. Details in Modules 5, 9 and 15. MANAGEMENT: PROTOCOL FOR MAJOR MUS The authors developed a trea tment protocol that adds steps specifically designed for complex MUS patients and also incorporates the skills previously described. They confirmed protocol utility by conducting randomized contr olled trials. In randomized studies [57] [58] treatment groups showed clear improvements in physical disability, overall mental health and depression, and decreased use of narcotics and benzodia zepines -\u00ad compared with controls. Additionally, the interventionsresulted in higher satisfaction with the provider-\u00adpatient rela tionship, increased use of full-\u00addose a ntidepressants and no cost increase.[59] A recent study in Israel using a similar approach demonstrated decline in hospital visits, healthca re expenditures and mortality.[60] In summary, the trial authors named its elements as education, co mmitment , goals and nego tiatio n. Educat e patients using specif ic strategies that help them understand that symptoms are not due to a life-\u00adthreatening proc ess, that their problem has a name, that the symptoms are not \"in your head\", and that their functioning can be improved despite the symptoms' a pparent intractability. Obta in a commitment to become an a ctive participant in treatment. Agree on achievable goals so that progress can be assessed and celebrated. Nego tiate details of active participation in a specific treatment plan. Educat ion: share perspec tives The goal of education is for patients to understand their condition. Simple reassurance is not usually eff ective. B e optimistic and rea listic\u2014\"it is possible to manage symptoms and function better, but not possible to cure this illness.\" Elicit patients' ideas about what explains their symptoms a nd listen to their concerns about wha t that means for the future (Module 9). Confidently convey to patients tha t their symptoms and findings do not indicate life-\u00adthreatening disease and that further testing would not be helpful at this time. Assure them that you believe their problems are real and not \"in your head.\" Name the condition -\u00ad use a somatic disorder for which some of the symptom criteria are present (e.g., fibromyalgia), or a descriptive name like chronic low back pain. Ascertain that pa tients understand that stress ca n lead to bodily symptoms. Then explain further that their past history of a buse, current stresses or depression produces chronic adrenalin relea se and muscle spasms, or that chemical imbala nces rela ted to depression contribute to increased perception of pain. (see \"Causes\" above) Share evidence that antidepressants are better than narcotics and tranquilizers for long-\u00ad term treatment of MUS. Off er an appropria te, plausible mechanism f or the symptoms, but remind patients that many mysteries remain about mind-\u00adbody connections. We suggest statements a nd questions that are elements of this process on the next page. Educat ion statements Conversations might include the following elements to legitimize some of patients' thinking and perspectives, a nd track associations that could be usef ul. \"The good news is that you do not have a life threatening disease and more tests would not add to our certa inty right now.\" \"You have (name the condition).\" \" I have treated many other patients with this condition.\"\"This is probably ca used by, or at least exaggerated by... (e.g., abnormal wiring in the brain or abnormal muscle contra ctions).\" \"While we are unlikely to cure it, you and I can work together to move it f rom the center of your life...\" \"I see that you are still worried that (e.g. ozone, high-\u00adtension wires, microwa ves, yeasts) might be causing your troubles, and I know other people blame those things too; however, current evidence sug gests (repeat your previous explana tions), and I want to keep working at wha t has been shown to be helpful, so that you can manage better.\" \"You are suff ering terribly. One thing that would help you and me monitor progress and discover things we might change would be a diary. Would you be willing to write down something about your symptoms each day? Then we can look it over together.\" Ask patient fo r commit ment to active partnership Patients will not improve unless they make a commitment to active participation in treatment. Both clinicia ns and patients are aware of remarkable advances in biomedicine, and eager to find a broken mechanism tha t might be simply fixed, usually with a drug or procedure. When \"finding and fixing\" is not possible, managing pa tients' symptoms and health requires a ctive participation f rom both parties. Just as patients with severe organic illnesses who have no specif ic treatment options left must manage medic ations well, treat depression, eat well, exercise when possible a nd keep up their social relationships, patients with MUS must take responsibility for active participation in their non-\u00adspecific trea tments or neither their f unction nor their symptoms will improve. Ask patients for an explicit commitment to following plans developed jointly. Anticipate out loud that their eff orts will be rewarded in the short and long term, but that since medicine cannot f ind a broken part, the task is to find wa ys to improve f unction. Avoid statements that blame the patient for lack of progress, and show apprecia tion for any small victories. We suggest statements a nd questions that are elements of this process on the next page. Commitment statements Conversations might include the following elements to underscore t he need for active commitment and partnership in improving function. \"We have treatment that works, but you and I will have to work hard at it together. It is going to be a lot of work, proba bly harder than you have ever worked on your health, but it will be worth it. \"Are you on board with this, and willing to carry out your part?\"It's hard to go to exercise class or walk every da y (etc), a nd may take ma ny tries to be successful-\u00ad just like losing weight or stopping smoking. Let's look for simple steps in the right direction that you know are likely to work for you.\" \"We were both optimistic about taking that next step, but something got in the way. Tell me about what happened for you....\" \"Are you really committed to walking? On a 1-\u00ad10 scale (where 1 is not at all and 10 is total commitment), where would you put yourself\" \"Why did you not pick a lower number?\" \"What would it take to help you do better?\" \"You seem discoura ged. I know your lif e is miserable-\u00ad from what I've seen. I think you have the strength to keep at this. I know you could be better. What do you think?\" Agree o n goals and assess pro gress Some patients expect the clinician to have the \"a nswers\" and may be resistant to a process of joint goal-\u00adsetting. Engage patients in setting both long-\u00adterm goals and short term goals, so that they c an assess a nd celebrate progress. Help MUS patients remember tha t many illnesses, such as diabetes, hardening of arteries or a stroke a re not curable. Like these patients, patients with MUS need to establish realistic long term goals to keep functioning, or improve functioning after setbacks. Living with an incurable illness is hard work and people function better if they decide to pursue goals that t hey know may have positive eff ects. Managing blood sugar, avoiding blindness, preventing another stroke, learning to walk or talk again are realistic yet difficult goals. Examples of realistic long-\u00adterm goals for MUS patients are improved work and school record, rela tionships, mental health, physical and emotional function, and somewhat improved symptoms. Achievement of long term goals depends on skill and creativity at negotiating realistic short-\u00adterm goa ls. These are the specif ic day-\u00adto-\u00adday, week-\u00adto-\u00adweek behaviors that could eventually lead to the long-\u00adterm success. Exercise, medita tion, and diminishing reliance on addictive medications are examples. Work with patients to obtain their commitment to work on a limited number of goals. D evise protocols tha t enable people to a chieve and measure smal l successes that can be celebrated at the following visit. Failure to achieve goa ls is common and predictable, but definitely not a f ailure of the overall treatment plan. Very often, f ailures are due to unexpressed a mbivalence tha t results in a \"socially accepta ble\" agreement to do a task, rather than a thoughtful commitment to it. Most patients have difficulty disclosing ambivalence or reluctance, or they may be unaware of it until after the visit. Unanticipated larger or smaller obstacles, such as a partner' s disagreement, a new crisis, a sick pet or a snowstorm explain other failures. Some are due to unsuspected substance misuse or abuse. Keeping a n \"eye on the prize\" is essential but difficult when life is complicated by so many elements that hamper even small successes. The clinician's role is to persist at examining and reviewing the total picture, to revise short term goals so that success is possible, and to express hope, empathy and respect. For clinicians, mindfully maintaining a n empathic stance and expressing curiosity, respect and apprecia tion of patients' positive qualities when progress is absent or fleeting is challenging, sometimes maddening, and yet is one key to their patients ' success.We suggest statements a nd questions that are elements of this process on the next page. Goal-\u00adsetting stat ements Focus the conversation. Keep it practical. Examine the total context. Review any homework. D evelop new short-\u00adterm goals to be achieved by the next visit. Dialogue about goal-\u00adsetting will often include statements and questions like the following: \"What are some of the thing s you would like to be doing if you weren't feeling so badly?\" \"What two to three things could you commit to doing over the next one to two weeks?\" \"Let's review your homework that we agreed on a t the last visit.\" \"You thought tha t medita ting for 5 minutes twice a day would be possible for you. What has g otten in the way?\" \"It seemed that you were ready to walk for 15 minutes twice daily at your last visit. On review, we can see that you had some success, but not at all wha t we anticipated. Tell me what happened?\" \"I know you were reluctant to cut back on your oxycodone prescription. Has anything else changed over the past two weeks since I cut back your prescription?\" Nego tiate specific treat ment steps Reach agreement on an individualized specif ic treatment plan. The key aspects of a fruitful negotiation process include the above-\u00addescribed elements of educating, goal-\u00adsetting and obtaining commitment. The negotia tion process begins as the clinician establishes the dia gnosis. Not only do plans usually require several visits to complete and review, but also plan review modif ication should occur at ea ch visit. In addition to the skills discussed regarding perspectives, explora tion and information sharing, clinicians will use skills delineated in Modules 11, 15, 16, and 17 in seeking agreement on a specif ic pla n. For typical patients with moderate to severe MUS, plans usually include some combination of the following a ctions: full dose anti-\u00addepressants for treatment of co-\u00admorbid depression and/or anxiety substitution of non-\u00adaddicting medications f or addicting ones to treat symptoms simple physica l therapy, exercises or relaxation routines, often designed in consultation with experts agreement that the patient will not self-\u00adrefer to other providers and will take only the medications prescribed in this relationshipinvolvement of a significant family member. Nego tiatio n strategies During visits, review the plans and negotia te any new elements. Use written contracts to emphasize the importance of the plan' s elements and the partnership. Dialogue about trea tment plans will often include statements like the following: \"Anybody who has been throug h what you have been throug h would be anxious or depressed. We have f ound that treating depression and anxiety a lso help significantly to improve symptoms like yours.\" \"The medications you are now taking are addicting and as you have seen a re not very ef fective in the long-\u00adterm... Antidepressants are very ef fective pain medications\" \"With your permission, I would like to try to slowly wea n you off X... and start you on Y... Do not worry. We will go very slowly. My g oal is to help you get better, not to get worse.\" \"I will go over some specif ic exercises tha t have been very helpful f or other patients.\" \"Before you go to the ER, see other doctors a bout these problems, change the doses of your medications, or start other medicines, please discuss your ideas with me.\" \"Bring your (supportive family member, or supportive significant other) to your next visit.\" \"So that we know we are in full agreement about the pla ns, I'm going to write them out, review them carefully with you and ask you to sign them. That way we'll have something in writing to reference in our work tog ether.\" \"How does this (any of the above statements) sound to you?\" \"Can we agree to make (any of the above statements) part of your treatment plan?\" Video is loading... Treatment Francesca D wamena , MD Dr. Dwamena comments on the videos you are about to see in which Dr. Smith works with a patient with moderate to severe MUS Consultat ion and Ho spitalizat ion Cultivate relationships with consultants and peers who understand the dyna mics of MUS, who can assist with the frequent interactional and emotional problems and who can help you add to your expertise and facility with ma naging these complex patients. Clinicians often need the help of mental health providers and other specialists to perform diagnostic tests or to assist with co-\u00admorbid problems or with refractory MUS cases. Partner with consultants who will curtail investigation a fter an appropriate but not necessarily exha ustive assessment, and who will clearly convey to the patient that no new disease was f ound and that no further testing is needed. Inform consultants that your patient has or may have MUS so that they can a void inadvertent reinforcement of the patient's f ears of undiagnosed organi c disease. Patients may worry that ref erral means abandonment and need explicit rea ssurance of your continuing involvement and long-\u00adterm support. Hospitalize patients with psychiatric or physical insta bility, but not for treatment of symptoms. Ms. A (a real patient) In the following videos, Drs. Dennis Novack, Carol Landau and their resident team work with Mrs. A, an actual patient ref erred to their clinic. Drs. Novack and Landau created the \"Problem Patient Clinic\" lled the \"Medical Psychological Consulta tion Clinic,\") as a consultative resource and learning experience at Rhode Isla nd Hospital. With residents working alongside them weekly for 12 yea rs they saw pa tients who had multiple symptoms f or which organic disease could not be identified. The team interviewed these patients from one to three times, occasionally making home visits, and then contacted the referring clinician with a dvice on how to manage the patients more effectively. This approach informed a nd had many elements in common with the \"Educate, Commitment, Negotiate, Goals\" paradigm (above), had a positive impact on patient outcomes, and helped clinicia ns feel less frustrated in caring for these complex patients. Patients with MUS develop their symptoms over time, and many factors contribute to their onset a nd maintenance. A careful and focused interview can help you understand how development, f amily environment, social, financial, and cultural factors, personality a nd affect interweave to effect expression of multiple symptoms. Such an understanding gives you the ba sis for designing eff ective therape utic interventions and a comprehensive treatment plan. After each video segment Dr. Novack poses questions that can help focus your thinking about the genesis and treatment of medically unexplained symptoms. After each set of questions, you might want to pause, reflect, and write down your thoughts. It would be helpf ul to view these video segments with colleagues, as rich discussions and new understand ing can emerge. At the end, you should have a better idea of how and why Mrs. A developed her symptoms, what factors keep them going, and what you could do to help her improve her symptoms and her quality of life.

The Patient's ViewVideo is loading... The Do ctor's View Robert M. Arnold, M.D. Questio ns fo r Reflect ion: 1. Have you experienced any advance care planning (ACP) interviews? How would you begin such a conversation? 2. What are your goals when talking with patients about ACP? 3. What do patients seek in ACP conversations? 4. During conversations about ACP, which patient questions or responses might be most unsettling? 5. How have your personal or professional conversations about living and/or dying with a serious illness prepared you for ACP talks? Key Principles: ACP conversations should begin at a time of relative health. ACP conversations are pa rt of routine medical care for all patients with serious illness. ACP includes goals of care for the present and for the future; a nd planning conversations should be revisited as patients' medical condition change. ACP conversations reassure patients, strengthen relationships, diminish potential family conflicts, and guide medical therapy. ACP conversations discuss patients' goals for quality of life, and explore which treatments they are willing to endure to meet these goals. Learning go als: At the co nclusion o f this mo dule, yo u will be able to : Describe nine ways that ACP benef its patients, f amilies and healthcare providers. Demonstrate a seven-\u00adstep approach to ACP.Focus on patients' values and goals, ra ther than treatment options for ACP. Describe differences between Advance Care Planning and Advance D irectives . INTRODUCTION An Advance Care Planning conversation explores patients' current and future healthcare goa ls and values, as well as their wishes about future treatment options. An Advance Ca re Planning (ACP) conversation is an ongoing conversation that begins during a time of health when patients a re less vulnerable and the situation less emotionally charged (than when they a re ill). B elow we list some benefits of ACP. In addition, providers should bring up or revisit ACP in some specif ic situations, such as the following: Patients with serious illness such as cancer, congestive heart f ailure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, neurological conditions like A LS, multiple sclerosis or dementia Patients with worsening clinical status, declining functional status, or imminent expected complica tions Patients with f requent readmissions to the hospital Members of vulnera ble popula tions whose physicians may not follow a preferred decision-\u00admaker's decisions unless the person is a legally designated health care proxy. Included in these groups a re same-\u00adsex couples, common-\u00adlaw couples, and single people. Use the \"surprise\" question: Ask yourself , \"Would I be surprised if this patient died in the next two years?\" If the answer is \"no\", then ACP is warranted. Your role in ACP is to enga ge pa tients in thinking about what is most important should their time be limited and to give patients space and time to clarif y values and learn more about treatment options. Often patients have not thought much about getting sicker or what might be important to them when gravely ill. Understanding patients' preferences, clinicians can recommend treatments and other interventions that a re consistent with the patient's va lues and goals. ACP conversations can be conducted in either outpatient or inpatient settings as patients' health status changes over time. Advance Directives (AD) are any written documents that state patients' wishes for how to address future medical decisions. We begin this Module with a f ocus on suggested steps for conducting Adva nce Care Planning conversations , and end with discussion of written Advance Directives (AD). Clinical Scenario: Kate is a resident on a primary care rotation in D r. Robert Arnold's office. Last week, she admitted a n 85-\u00adyear-\u00adold man with metastatic lung cancer. He wa s ill with sepsis and acute renal failure, and intubated in the ICU for two weeks. There was no documentation of any previous conversations about end-\u00adof -\u00adlife wishes. His children struggled to make the de cision to take him of f the ventilator, as he had never discussed his wishes for end-\u00adof-\u00adlife care with them. Ultimately, he died on the ventilator af ter a cardiac arrest. She is wondering how this situation could havebeen avoided. Why do ACP? ACP conversations benef it patients and their entire care-\u00adgiving team, primarily by generating trust, exchanging inf ormation Your conversations about ACP can address both medical and non-\u00admedical goals, build clinician-\u00adpatient trust, ease conflicts and fa cilitate decision-\u00adma king. ACP also prepares patients for diverse and unpredictable contingencies, including loss of decision-\u00admaking capacity and death. Thoughtf ul ACP conversations contribute strongly to minimizing burdens on pa tients, f amilies and all caregivers. Appropriate documentation of ACP conversations a llows clinicians to better advocate for the patients' wishes, better assist surrogates in making decisions when patients ca n no longer do so for themselves, and decrease potential conflict with f amily members and other clinicia ns. We list some specific patient benefits of ACP conversations below. Patients can... ...clarify their values and consider their feelings about what would matter to them most if facing a serious illness. ...develop a sense of control and obtain assura nce that their preferences are important a nd will be honored during a ll stages of their illness, and as they approach death. ...learn what to expect as they approac h living with a serious illness and learn about life-\u00adsustaining and pallia tive care treatment options. ...help their loved ones and clinicians understand their goals, so that if they lose the ability to make decisions for themselves the healthcare that is provided is consistent with their values. ...relieve their loved ones of the decision-\u00admaking burden. Families report both less stress associated with decision-\u00admaking and more certainty that their decisions are consistent with patients' goa ls and values. ...better prepare themselves f or death and find opportunity to reflect about their life's mea ning a nd accomplishments. Now, we list some clinician benefits of ACP conversations. Clinicians can... ...generate more trusting rela tionships so that patients can more openly communicate their true hopes, fears and concerns. ...feel more confident that they are ordering interventions in patients' best interest. ...coordina te specif ic interventions that are consistent with patients' wishes. Hindrances t o ACP Despite the universally acknowledged importance of ACP and the benef its listed above, too f ew conversations are conducted. As in Kate's experience a bove, in the absence of ACP conversations, physicians and families experience frustrations and confusion when patients become seriously ill, and patients' ca re is often compromised. We list some patient barriers to engaging in ACP conversations below. Patients ... ...find it emotionally dif ficult to contemplate a worsening medical condition ...cannot predict their future experience of illness, or imagine what interventions such as CPR, mechanical ventilation, or dialysis would feel like. ...often change preferences - while feeling healthy they wish for life-\u00adsustaining care, but when seriously ill they seek a more comf ort-\u00adoriented approach. Conversely, patients with slowly progressive serious illness who think they would never want life support may change pref erences as they adapt to limitations. We list some physician barriers to engaging in ACP conversations below. Clinicia ns... ...perceive that A CP talk would take too much time or displace other activity ...may be concerned tha t asking patients to foresee their wishes if they were to get sicker might contribute to their becoming depressed or to losing hope ...often f eel unskilled about having ACP conversations Kate asks D r. Arnold about how he brings up ACP. He says that he is about to meet with Ms. Conners, a patient whom he's known f or 5 years. When they first met she was undergoing cancer treatment, and D r. Arnold had an initial discussion about advance directives at that visit. He obtained permission f rom Ms. Conners to videotape that encounter for teaching purposes, and asks Kate to view it now. Prepare pat ients Introduce the topic of ACP by telling patients that you would like to discuss how they would like to handle decision-\u00admaking if they become unable to make decisions for themselves. Begin the ACP process by ascertaining whether patients have already designated a health care proxy or established a written plan such as a living will or by completing a Five Wishes booklet (see more on wills and wishes in \"Instructional Directives\" below). Ask patients if they know whom they want to make medical decisions if they were to become unable to make them. For patients who are unable to communicate because they are too ill, unconscious or mentally incapable, seek information from other clinicians regarding possible prior ACP conversations or written directives . AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) OPEN A CONVERSATION Assemble people that patients would like to be present and directly but gently open the ACP conversation. If patients have not made prior plans, begin by explaining that you are raising the ACP because you wa nt to support them, understand and honor their goals and help them achieve those goals. Make certain that the people whom patients wa nt involved in the conversation a re present. Many physicians legitimize the conversa tion by saying, \"I talk with all my pa tients a bout advance care planning and living wills. What do those things mean to you?\" If patients are already seriously ill, put the conversation into the context of the illness process. You might say something like, \"I talk with all my pa tients a bout what they would want if they become sicker. What are your thoughts about this?\" \"Because this has been a difficult time f or you, I' d like your advice about how to handle decisions if you get worse or if you become unable to do so yourself.\" Many patients may demonstrate emotion a t this time, and physicians should respond with empathic statements, such as, \"I can imagine how distressing this can be. \" \"I'm prepared to work with you and with your f amily, no ma tter what happens.\" In some studies, 25% of patients say they do not wish to talk about these issues or make decisions about the future. A compassionate response might be ... \"Sounds like this is something you do not feel comfortable discussing today. Some people want to be very involved in making these decisions while others don' t. I wonder if there a re specific reasons that you f ind this difficult at this time?\" Check perceptions If you need to update patients' understanding of their illness a nd prognosis with new information that they perceive as \"bad news,\" separate that news f rom the ACP conversation. Accurate inf ormation helps patients to make decisions that are consistent with their values. For example, patients who understand that their life expectancy is limited are more likely to opt for a comfort-\u00adfocused approa ch. Patients' understanding of their illness process a nd potential outcomes may be limited or spotty because of overwhelming emotions or because of temporarily limited cognitive ability. A t such times it is pref erable to focus on clarifying their details of their illness situation and their values. If new information is heard as \"bad news,\" give patients space and time to process this to mull it over,. This ma y mean postponing the topic of a nd take up ACP to a future encountersepara tely. Assess what patients understand, perhaps by asking:\"What is your understanding of your illness?\" \"What do you expect will happen in the f uture?\" \"As you think a bout your situa tion, what is the best a nd the worst that might happen?\" Ask patients what they want to know, what concerns they have, and how much detail would be most helpf ul in their decision-\u00adma king process. \"What would be most helpf ul for me to tell you about your situation at this time?\" \"Would a 'general picture' or a more detailed des cription be better f or you rig ht now?\" Focus on go als and values Your ACP conversations should always be guided by your patients' goals and values - not by specif ic interventions . Satisfactory ACP cannot be undertaken in the absence of information a bout patients' va lues and their treatment goals. Ask patients to expla in their hopes for treatment, to say what health state would be acceptable, to descri be what makes life worth living, to name the activities they most value, and whether there a re personal goals they want to achieve. Ask also about wha t they would most like to avoid. Given sanitized and generally optimistic scenarios a bout CPR a nd intensive trea tment interventions such as dialysis or mechanical ventilation in film and television, f ew patients can infer wha t such interventions would mean in their own illness process. A focus on patients' goa ls instead of specific treatment interventions gives physicia ns a better chance to recommend treatments that will help patients achieve their goa ls. One wa y to discover key pref erences is to explore patients' experiences with friends or relatives with serious illness, and to assess the meaning of these experiences. \"What experience do you have o f being with someone who was seriously ill?\" \"Based on what you saw, what would be your concerns if you were in a similar situation?\" \"What makes life worth living for you?\" \"What would be most important if your time was limited? Discovering which situations a re not acceptable to patients is one ef fective approach to helping patients uncover crucia l information on preferences. Typical unacceptable situ ations include being unable to meaningfully interact with loved ones or living in a facility for the rest of their life. Ask also what risks patients are willing to take to avoid such situations. \"What circumstances might there be in which you would find life not worth living?\" \"What situations would you most wa nt to avoid?\" ASSESS TREATMENT PREFERENCES Guide the discussion so that you can understand as thoroughly as possible what connectionspatients envision between their goa ls and their treatment preferences or choices. As you develop your understanding of patients' goals and values, questions and speculations about specif ic treatments inevita bly arise. Patients are both curious a nd worried, and ma ny have personal experiences and knowledge based on months or years of interventions (chemotherapy, congestive heart f ailure, etc.) f or themselves or for family members. Most pa tients' preferences for potentially life-\u00adsust aining therapies are hierarchica l (from most aggressive and interventiona l to least). If patients do not want to be readmitted to the hospital, then you probably don' t need to ask for views regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Instead you can simply make a recommendation about resuscitation (see below). You will be required to balance values and goals alongside preferences for (or against) specific treatments available. Be specific in your inquiry about treatments, a nd then be curious about what outcomes patients hope f or with (or without) a specif ic intervention. Given that many patients may not understand the implications or specifics of a n intervention, the f ocus should be on the desired outcome of the therapy rather than the therapy itself . Identify what life situations the patient would find unacceptable (e.g. \"being a vegetable on a machine\"). Listen attentively to patients' responses to inquiries such as \"What are your thoughts about chemotherapy at this point?\" \"If you get sicker, how would you feel a bout coming back to the hospital?\" \"We should talk about if you wa nt to be put back on the breathing machine if your breathing were to get worse again.\" Then fashion your responses in such a way that patients are encouraged to clarify relationships between interventions and values, such as the following: \"I heard you say that you don't want treatment Xdialysis. Tell me more about your thinking behind this so I know your specific reasons.\" \"Am I hearing you correctly - are you saying that your goal is to avoid living in a nursing home if that would be a X as a long-\u00adterm treatarrange ment?\" \"Under what circumstances might you be willing to undergo mechanical ventilation receive treatment X?\" \"You are saying that you wish to avoid more chemotherapy - what do you hope to achieve by declining it at this time?\" Continue to dialogue, eliciting preferences for specif ic treatments, telling information about the treatments and assessing the patient's va lues. You wish to ensure that your pat ients understand the implica tions of decisions regarding specif ic treatments and that you understand the pa tient's values. Artificial nutritio n and hydratio n In some states nutrition and hydration are differentiated f rom other treatments. Provision of artificial nutrition and hydration is a specia l case when it comes to which trea tments you must ask about. In most states, a rtificial nutrition a nd hydration is not considered differently from any other life-\u00adsustaining therapy such as dialysis, CPR, or a respira tor. In these states a health care proxy can make artificial nutrition a nd hydration decisions just as with any life-\u00ad sustaining therapy. However, in other states such as New York, Pennsylvania, and Missouri,health care proxies require more evidence that they know patients' specif ic pref erences regarding artificial nutrition a nd hydration. (See Appendix 1 for an example of a more specif ic proxy f orm.) AGREE ON A PLAN A successf ul plan specif ies recommendations for interventions that are acceptable and those that will be avoided. Discuss f irst what can be done for the patient, rather than what cannot be done. \"I hear that your goal is to continue chemotherapy if it will help you live longer and if you don't have too many complications. You also wa nt to maximize time with your family. Ultimately, if you get rea lly sick, you'd rather be at home than in the hospital. So I'd recommend that we continue chemotherapy and only a dmit you to the hospital for treatable conditions like inf ections. If you get really sick, we will not use machines, because those will not help you meet your goal of being with your family.\" When you mention what treatments will be avoided, tell patients and families what will be done instea d. This assures the success of the overall advance care plan and will assuage some a nxieties of patients and their families. \"If something should ha ppen and your heart stops or you stop breathing while you're in the hospital, we would give you medications to make sure that you are breathing comfortably and not suffering from a nxiety.\" Recommend a treatment plan that is aligned both with patients' goals and with the medical realities. Make a reco mmendat ion abo ut co de status Focus conversations a bout resuscitation a round patients' perspectives regarding an acceptable quality of life. Do not focus on specific interventions. Experts (12) propose that conversations regarding resuscitation pref er ences f ocus on three issues: Patients' quality of life, before any arrest or resuscitation effort What patients hope their post-\u00adresuscitation qua lity of life will be The probability of successf ul resuscitation (where \"success\" is a chievement of patients' hoped for post-\u00adresuscitation qua lity of life) A recommendation about how to respond in the event of the patient's death often f ollows quite naturally once you have a ssessed the patient's goals and values. \"Given the importance you place on being at home and not being readmitted to the hospital, my recommendation wo uld be tha t when death comes, we allow you to die naturally.\" Some healthcare f acilities have incorporated this langua ge into their orders, using \"AND\" or \"AllowNatural D -\u00ad a specif ic example of an Advance D irective, which in this case anticipates the possibility of cardiopulmonary arrest and the patient's inability to ma ke a considered decision a t that time. (see a more complete discussion on Advance Directives below.) Elicit Preferences Check goals, by asking \"Why this goal?\" and telling how you will support their goals. Ask patients to explain their goals for treatmen t, and probe for an understanding of what makes their life worth living a nd what personal goals they want to achieve. Alternatively, ask about their fears and what they would wa nt to avoid. One wa y to begin such questioning is to explore their experiences with f riends' or relatives' end of life care and to inquire how that experience impacts their perspective. \"What experience do you have of being with someone who was dying ?\" \"Based on what you saw, what, for you, ma kes the dif ference between a good death and a bad death?\" \"What makes live worth living for you?\" \"What would be most important if your time was limited? Wha t would you want to avoid?\" Another interviewing skill involves reversing the question in order to explore the same issue from a different perspective. For instance, after asking what does make life worth living f or the patient, reverse the question and explore what situations they would f ind unacceptable (e.g., persistent vegetative state) and what risks they are willing to take to avoid such situations. \"What circumstances might there be in which you would find life not worth living ?\" CLOSE ACP CONVERSATION End an ACP conversation by apprecia ting of patients' participation, and stress patients' autonomy. Express your a ppreciation for patients' willingness to talk about the topic and emphasize that you will remain a ctively involved regardless of what goals they wish to pursue. Give a clea r description of what you will do to meet patients' goals. \"I've heard you expla in that A, B, and C are important to you. I want you to know that as your physician I will do X, Y, a nd Z in order to help you accomplish these things and that I plan to stay actively involved in your ca re.\" Second, stress that you are engaged in an ongoing conversation, and tha t patients can a lways change their mind. \"I want to thank you for helping me understand your values and goals. Have you talked to anyone else about what' s most important to you?\" \"I want to thank you for helping me understand what's most important to you as a person and how those values inform the decisions you might make if you get sicker. Over time, patients sometimes change their mind and so I will be sure to check in withyou as we go along.\" Today, Ms. Conners has returned f or a follow-\u00adup visit. It is now five years after the encounter Kate just viewed. Unfortunately, Ms. Conners' cancer has sprea d. Dr. Arnold is planning to address Ms. Conners' wishes surrounding her care going forward given this worsening of her disease. He reviews the steps he usually goes through in these conversations. AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text ) Document ACP co nversat ions Chart your conversation, and if the notes a re not accessible by other providers, conta ct them and share appropriate details Be sure to document the context f or your conversations, the pa tient's goals and values, a nd the plan, including any pending decisions. At subsequent visits, establish that you are on the same page with patients by reading what you noted in the record. Kate thanks D r. Arnold for the learning opportunity to watch and discuss the conversation with Mrs. Connors. Ka te says \"I really liked that you began by talking about the patient and eliciting what was important to her. Then you were able to make some recommendations that made sense within her context. I think I will try that next time. But I'm wondering how we will make sure these decisions are honored if she goes to the hospital.\" Dr. Arnold answers, \"That's one reason I made sure to send my note to Mrs. Connors herself . Our conversation, and my documentation of it, will be in the medical record. But you're right. If she goes to another hospital that' s not in our system, they might not have access to the records. On our next visit, I plan to complete a POLST form with Mrs. Connors a nd her husband, and will give them a copy to take home with them on a bright pink page. I tell patients to keep this somewhere where they will remember it, like on their refrigerator. This doctor's order will be valid across the state.\" ADVANCE DIRECTIVES \"Stand-\u00adalone\" Advance D irectives have proven ineff ective, but written Advance D irectives continue to play an important role when joined with documented Advance Care Pla nning conversations. \"Advance D irective (AD )\", refers to a ny written document that states patients' wishes for addressing f uture medical decisions. Physicia ns hoped that AD would be the solution to the troubling situation of unwanted treatments at the end of life, but they proved ineffective f or the following reasons: Patients are seldom able to think hypothetically about f uture illness and even less a ble to predict what type of care they would want Patients' perspectives, goals, values, a nd preferences often change over time The content of many written D irectives is either too specific or too vague to apply to the situation at hand.Patients who write a Directive often f ail to discuss the document, or physicians or families forget such discussions. In recognition of these limitations, experts underscore the importa nce of Advance Care Planning conversations, as described in deta il above. These conversations may a lso be recorded as a formal written Advance D irective, and of course the outcomes of conversa tions will be documented in the medical record. Instructio nal Direct ives Instructional directives such as a living will or the Five Wishes booklet permit patients to instruct others about their preferences should they lose capacity to decide f or themselv es. The Five Wishes booklet is considered a legal document in 42 states and prompts patients to designate wishes about 5 topics: Who they wa nt to make health care decisions if they lose capacity to make decisions themselves The kind of medical treatment they want How comfortable they want to be How they want people to trea t them What they wa nt their loved ones to know The workbook section of the Five Wishes prompts patients to choose preferences for life-\u00adsupport treatment in three situations -\u00ad close to death, permanent and severe brain damage, and coma from which the patient is not expected to recover. Patients can a lso describe any a dditional conditions under which they would not want to be kept alive. The living will is the oldest form of a dvance directive , devised in 1969 as a way for individuals to express health care desires when no longer able to express current health care wishes. A living will can be very specific or very general. As discussed, this point-\u00adin-\u00adtime document is less helpful than Advance Care Planning conversations . If patients have already executed an instructional directive , ACP conversation will be facilitated by having them bring that document to the discussion, f or review a nd to ensure that it is still reflective of their wishes given their current hea lth status. Any instructional directive could include a section f or the designation of a proxy decision-\u00admaker. Dr. Arnold now invites Kate in to observe his f ollow up visit with Mrs. Conners. Proxy Directives Proxy directives designate someone to make medical decisions if patients lose capacity to make decisions, but do NOT specify wishes for care. The decision-\u00adma ker is usually referred to as the \"health care proxy\", but may a lso be cal led a\"durable power of attorney for health care\" or a \"health care power of attorney.\" Proxies' levels of authority and decision-\u00admaking responsibility vary by state. In most states, patients' health care providers cannot serve as their proxy, nor can individuals under the age of 18. Be sure your patients discuss their health care proxy choice with family members, especia lly if the proxy choice is unconventional (e.g., if a patients choose a friend ra ther than a spouse). Of course, the proxy should expre ss willingness to undertake that role, and if possible to be present for ACP discussions with providers, in order to fully understand patients' wishes. POLST Directives A POLST (Physician Orders for Life-\u00adSustaining Trea tment) form helps ensure that emergency medical personnel and inpatient teams follow patients' wishes. Ethicists and other experts designed the POLST program in an additiona l attempt t o ensure that patients' end-\u00adof -\u00adlife wishes are honored. After originating in Oregon in 1991, the current POLST paradigm creates a ctionable medical orders that a re \"translations\" of decisions made in conversation a nd discussion among patents, family members and proxies. Because ea ch state implements its own program (43 a s of 2014), specif ics such as name (e.g. MOLST, COLST, MOST, and POST), implementa tion deta ils, and the structure of forms utilized varies widely. The POLST form, when completed in one setting such as a hospital, clinic, or nursing facility, is transferred with the patient to the next setting, where it can be used as a code status order and to clarify the patient's pre-\u00adexisting goals of care. More information about the POLS T program: www.polst.org . See Appendix 2 for examples of POLST forms. Note that \"non-\u00adPOLST\" advance directives are recommended for any adult, provide instructions (but not \"orders\" in the medical sense) f or future treatment, a nd are not specific about wha t emergency medical personnel or inpatient treatment teams should do. CONCLUSION Clinicians who initiate ACP conversations during health - or during illness when patients are still able to think for themselves -\u00ad enable patients to thoughtfully prepare for un predictable future possibilities. Initiate an ACP conversation during health or during illness. Addressing the medical, emotional, and socia l issues that concern every patient is important because ma ny patients are reluctant to bring up these issues. Key elements in ACP conversations include eliciting patients' goals and values, attentively and empathetically listening and responding to their preferen ces, sharing information about ava ilable and realistic treatment possibilities and agreeing on a plan that is consistent with patients' pref erences and the current medical realities. While Advance directives have been largely supplanted by documented ACP conversations , Proxy D irectives and POLST Directives continue to play a very specific role in ACP.

What have been your reactions or your f amily' s reactions when you have heard bad news in the past? If you were receiving bad news, how could whoever is telling it to you help you hear it? In thinking about the communication of bad news, what makes it go well; what makes it go poorly? From whose standpoint are you answering this question? How can you take ca re of yourself while attending to the needs of patients and f amilies when you are obliged to deliver bad news? What are yourl f ears about illness and death? How might these fears affect your communication of bad news. Key Principles: 1. Communicating bad news is an everyday clinician task, a core clinical skill. 2. Bad news is defined by the person receiving the news. 3. The wa y bad news is delivered has a powerf ul impact on the clinica l relationship. 4. The wa y bad news is delivered is always af fected by providers' feelings (sadness, fear and anger, for example) and by their ability to respond to patients' a nd families' reactions. 5. Using the \"6 steps\" skills fosters a ccuracy and empathy during delivery of bad news and builds mutual trust and respect. Learning go als: At the co nclusion o f this mo dule, yo u will be able to : Describe a six-\u00adstep protocol f or delivering bad news Demonstrate 4 skillful responses to the expressed feelings of patients receiving bad news Name 4 common ba rriers or pitf alls in delivering bad news Demonstrate an understanding of the six steps and the ability to use them in a bad news delivery situation.INTRODUCTION \"Bad news\" is not limited to life-\u00adthreatening situa tions. Communicating bad news is an everyday event f or clinicians. B alancing the emotional jolt with compassion instea d of false hope or vague statements enables patients and f amilies to derive maximum benef it from a trying experience. Many clinicians find delivering bad news especially challenging when it involves a life-\u00adthreatening illness. S ome clinicians f eel uncomfortable with the strong emotions tha t bad news can elicit both in themselves and their patients. Others f eel inadequately prepared or inexperienced, or struggle with their desire to protect the patient and preserve hope, while simultaneously trying to be honest and develop realistic expecta tions. Despite these challenges, bad news can be conveyed clearly and compassi onately. Effectively breaking bad news can improve the patient's and f amily' s ability to plan and cope, encourage realistic goals and autonomy, support the patient emotionally, strengthen the clinician-\u00adpatient relationship, and f oster colla boration among the patient, f amily, clinicians, and other professiona ls. From a patient's perspective, diagnoses other than life-\u00adthreatening illnesses ma y qualify a s \"bad news\". Anything that has the potential to change someone's sense of self or health ma y be bad news; for example the diagnosis of new hypertension. Clinicia ns know that such conditions are common a nd usually easily treated, and can easily f orget what it means to a patient to hear that he needs to take a medication every day f or the rest of his life. Also, the implication of the diagnosis may be very different for a patient if there is a family history of myocardial infarction or stroke. Remembering that whether news is \"bad\" is determined by the listener, not the giver is a n important facet of empathic communica tion. We describe a 6 step process f or giving bad news, and also discuss specia l circumsta nces that commonly arise in the communication of bad news. These circumsta nces include discuss ing prognosis, discussing conflict between what the provider and the family think the patient should know, dealing with uncertainty, and telephone notification of death. COMMUNICATE NEWS AND SUPPORT -\u00ad A 6-\u00adSTEP PROTOCOL We outline and detail a 6-\u00adstep communication process tha t builds on what patients already know and what more they are ready to hear. The process respects the need for honesty a nd attentio n to individuals' needs to control the flow of facts and information, as well as to receive emotional support during a painful time. 1. Advance Planning 2. What does the patient know? 3. Ho w much do es the patient want to know? 4. Sharing t he info rmat ion 5. Respond t o emo tions 6. Establish a plan and follo w upStep 1: Advance planning Before delivering bad news, prepare yourself , prepare patients a nd families, choose an appropriate setting, and allot time f or full discussion. Prepare yourself. Imagine how your patient might f eel, a nd anticipate typical emotiona l reactions. Acknowledge your own feelings so tha t interactions are not driven by your sadness, anger, remorse, or guilt. Review thoroughly basic in formation about the illness and treatment options. Ensure that all necessary information is available. Rehearse what you will say. Consider bringing a colleague, nurse, or social worker. Prepare t he patient . When ordering a test or trea tment, let the patient (and family) know the possible outcomes, including both benign possibilities and more serious ones. This allows the patient and family to prepa re psychologically. Also, they may disclose inf ormation about the meaning of a particular diagnosis or specific concerns about possible outcomes that will help you respond more accura tely and compassionately. Determine whom the patient would like to invite. This might include f amily, surrogate decision makers, or members of the interdisciplinary team, such as a nurse, social worker or chaplain. Choose an appro priat e sett ing. Create an environment conducive to effective communication, usually a quiet, private place with a dequate seating. Be sure you are comf ortably seated at eye level with the patient. Allot a dequate time, a nd avoid interruptions by arranging to hold telephone calls and pages. Patients appreciate evidence that you are not rushing or running away. A box of facial tissues should be hand y. Step 2: What does the patient know? After initial greetings, have the patient and fa mily tell you what they already know. This provides a basic f ramework f or a patient-\u00adcentered discussion. Start by shaking hands, sitting down, and attending to comfort f or everyone present. If family members or others you have not met are present, introduce yourself and determine their relationship to the patient. The n establish what the patient and family already know about the patient's health and pay specia l attention to the emotional content of their response to your inquiry. A bad news conversation goes better when you can a djust the presenta tion of the news according to the participants' level of comprehension of the situation, and their emotional state. Questions might include: What do you understand so f ar about your illness? What did other doctors tell you about your condition? What have you heard so f ar about what the test showed? How serious did you think it might be when...? Occasionally a patient will fall silent and seem completely unprepared or unable to respond. To ease the situation and stimulate discussion, gently inquire further about what f amily and pa tient understand about the situation and recent tests or interventions. In rare circumstances, it may be better to reschedule the meeting for another time, a nd invite additional support persons. At times patients may ask you to stop \"beating around the bush\" and give them the news. Thissignif ies a readiness to move f orward with steps 3 and 4. Step 3: How much do es the patient want to know? Before actually delivering bad news, ask whether the patient is ready for discussion. Asking before telling is respectful and rela tionship-\u00adcentered, even though patients may guess that the news is not good based on your tone and facia l expression. Establish what a nd how much the patient wants to know. People handle informa tion differently and each pers on has the right to voluntarily decline to receive information. A patient may designate someone else to communicate on his or her behalf . Ask the patient and f amily how they would like to receive information before telling them. Possible questions include the f ollowing: Possible questions include the f ollowing: How much do you want to know about the results of the test? How much detail would you like me to g ive you about your condition? Some people really do not want to be told much at all about their condition, and would rather have f amily or a friend handle the information. Other people want every detail. Where do you stand on this issue of how much to tell? Ask a patient a bout general preferences for the handling of medical information and decision making early in the clinical relationship before significant information needs to be shared (this is ideally done in the pretest counseling period). This will help the clinician to avoid ma king a misstep. \"If your condition turns out to be serious, do you want to know? If not, whom should we tell?\" Step 4: Sharing t he info rmat ion If information is clearly bad, precede it with a \"warning shot\" Share informa tion in small amounts, using unambiguous but not insensitive language, giving p atients time to respond to each element you a re telling them.. Deliver the information in a sensitive but stra ightforward manner. Many experts recommend starting with a \"warning shot,\" which helps to prepa re the patient for bad news (such as \"I don't have good news...\"). Give the news using easily understood language, a nd then pause. Avoid delivering all implications of the information in a steady monol ogue. Provide information in small chunks, pausing frequently to a llow silence and time f or patient and f amily to ask questions about each a spect. Do not use technica l jargon or euphemisms (i.e. use the word \"cancer\", not \"carcinoma\" or \"tumor\"). Check often for understanding. Use silence and body langua ge as tools to facilitate the discussion and do not minimize the severity of the situation. Well-\u00adin tentioned ef forts to \"soften the blow\" may lead to va gueness and confusion. Patients appreciate honesty and straightforwardness as long as it is delivered with compassion. D irectness does not imply brutality or insensitivity. You might choose to break bad news by using language like: I feel badly to have to tell you this, but the growth turned out to be cancer. I'm afraid the news is not good. The biopsy showed that you have colon cancer.Unfortunately, there' s no question about the test results: you have been infected by HIV. The report is back, and it' s not as we had hoped. It showed that it is cancer. I'm afraid I have bad news. The tests show that you had a heart attack. Step 5: Respond t o emo tions Strong emotions usually accompany the reception of bad news. Respond to those patient and family feelings with legitimation and empathy. Reinforce your commitment to work through the process over time by answering questions and responding to feelings and distress . Patients and fa milies respond to bad news in a variety of ways. Responses ca n be af fective (tears, anger, anxiety, fear), cognitive (denial, blame, guilt, disbelief), spiritual (why me?), or even visceral (numbness, disorientation, fight/f light response). Whoever brings the bad news must balance patients' and fa milies' needs for information with their needs for emotional support. Keep in mind that their responses ma y be directed to you as the \"messenger\" of bad news. Recall that taking a patients' or families' anger or sadness personally will not only interfere with their ability to process this information, but also with your a bility to maintain a meaningf ul relationship them. Expressions of strong emotion make many clinicia ns uncomf ortable. Pause, a nd give the patient and family time to react instead of trying to limit emotion . Balance the shock with compassion; euphemisms or vague statements produce confusion and are not comforting. B e prepared to support them through a broad ra nge of reactionsBe prepared to support them through a broad range of reactions. Basic communication skills are useful to respond to emotions D ocCom Modules 6 and 13; PEARLS: Provide partnership We will work throug h this together. Is there anyone you would like me to ca ll? Explo re emotions a nd be sure you understand before providing rea ssura nce Tell me what is most upsetting to you.... Tell me what worries you the most... Empathize by st ating yo ur understanding I imagine it feels overwhelming; maddening ; very sad; etc. Ackno wledge the emotion. I can see that this is very upsetting. You seem overwhelmed by this news. Legitimize or no rmalize the emotion. Anyone in your shoes would be upset. A lot of people would feel a ngry right now Provide suppo rt I will stay with you. You will not be abandoned Avoid saying, \"I understand wha t you are going through.\" No one can truly understand wha t another person is going through. Remind patients a nd families that strong emotional responses are normal. Have a box of tissue available. Some patients may express their emotions nonverbally, so be awa re of how a patient lo oks as well as what they say. Some patients may initially \"shut down,\" perhaps f eeling overwhelmed by emotion or by internal ref lection about the personalmeaning of the news. Quietly listening and \"being with\" a patient in distress is a helpful nonverba l expression of caring. Consider touching the patient in an appropria te, reassuring manner. Allow time f or the patient and fa mily to express a ll of their immediate f eelings. Don't rush them. Once the emotion is fully expressed, most people will be able to move on. A shared understanding of the news and its meaning enhances t he clinician-\u00adpatient relationship and facilitateS future decision-\u00admaking and pla nning. Sometimes clinicians continue to talk while a patient is shut down or nonverbally expressing emotion. Don't be afraid of silence. If you f ind yourself talking too much (if the encounter becomes a monologue rather than a dialogue), pause and respond to the associated emotions (\"You seem overwhelmed...\") or count silent ly to 20 in your head. Stopping or slowing yourself helps patients experience your presence and support at a time when they cannot absorb your information. If the early discussion is a ll emotion, suggest tha t the patient may have many questions that you will address at a subsequent visit. If the patient's initial response is a ll intellectua l, suggest tha t they may notice strong emotions when they go home, and to call with any concerns. Step 6: Establish a plan and fo llow-\u00adup Make concrete plans with patients about next steps, and include both medical and personal parameters. Address saf ety issues. Reinforce your commitment and your availability for questions and follow-\u00adup. Establish plans for the next steps. They ma y include gathering additional inf ormation, , performing further tests and telling other f amily members. A rrange for appropriate referrals, and discuss potential sources of emotional and practical support, such as, f amily, significant others, friends, social worker, spiritual counselor, peer support group, professiona l therapist, hospice, or home health agency. Reassure pa tients and fa mily that they are not being abandoned and tha t you as the clinician will be actively engaged in a n ongoing plan to help. Indicate how patients and family can reach you to answer additional questions. Establish a specif ic time f or a follow-\u00adup appointment or phone call. Assess patients' safety and ensure that they will not be overwhelmed when they leave. Are there medical concerns that need immediate attention? Is a patient able to drive home a lone? Is a patient distraught, feeling despera te or suicidal? Is there someone at home to provide support? Patients and fa milies may r may not be able to make major medical decisions during an initia l conversation, when inf ormation sharing is the prima ry goal. You will probably have an opinion about what decisions could or should be made, but far more important is your provision of support for their decisions (or non-\u00addecisions), and your ef forts to maint ain a therapeutic rela tionship. This ensures both tha t the patient and family feel respected, and increases the likelihood that you will be able to provide guidance for their future decisions. SOME SPECIFIC SITUATIONS In this section we cover the following topicsClinician self-\u00adreflect ion In order to participate eff ectively in conversations about bad news, clinicians should review and explore their personal concerns a nd feelings that are typical in these situations. Some concerns and emotions may be obscure, conf using or discounted. When t he family says \"do n't tell\" Most pa tients eventually want to know their diagnosis, but listen carefully to a family' s request to withhold information. A ssess whether the request makes sense within the family system, culture, or patient values, a nd respond accordingly. When language is a barrier Use an experienced medical translator when delivering bad news to someone who speaks another language. In general, the same 6 step protocol can be followed, but when using a translator, be certain you double-\u00ad check understanding at each stage. Tips about co mmunicat ing prognosis When discussing prognosis give a range of time that the \"average person\" with this condition would live (hours to days, days to weeks, 3-\u00ad6 months, etc), and a llow f or exceptions. Clinicians tend to be optimistic, so be sure to prepare patients a nd families that the time could be shorter than anticipated. Telepho ne notificat ion of death Telephone notification about a death is a challenging communica tion problem, especially if you are a covering clinician without prior interactions with the fa mily. Prepare f or the call, identify who should be contacted, and follow the 6-\u00adstep protocol.(6) The challenges o f clinicians' stating \" I'm so rry\" \"I'm sorry\" is an empathic expression of sorrow, but it can be conf used with pity or with an apology, and ma y shift f ocus from the patient and family to the clinician. The significance of clinicians' saying \" I wish... \" Wishes stated by clinicians are first and foremost expressions of empathy. The clinician joins the patient and family in wishing that things were dif ferent, a nd simultaneously acknowledges the emotional impact of the loss. Clinician self-\u00adreflect ion To pa rticipate ef fectively in bad news conversations, review typical clinician concerns a nd feelings that surface in these situations. Often, emotions are obscure or confusing, but do explore your personal reactions, whether with trusted people or in solitude. Clinicians often experience confusing feelings when telling patients bad news. Nega tive, difficult and conflicting feelings are normal responses to disclosure of bad news. Clinician emotions include a sense of loss of control, a fear of death, feelings of guilt or loneliness, and at times more complex and less discernible feelings. The scope and intensity of emotion varies with the patient, the disease, past experience, and f amily attitudes. Acknowledge and accept the legitimacy of your own f eelings so that you can be fully present and conduct a respectful discussion. Do not fail to explore your own reactions to bad news conversations. What did the discussion bring up about your own life and your own f amily? It will sometimes be possible to take time right af ter a meeting with the patient to do this, other times you will have to wa it until the workday is finished. Some people find it helpful to discuss their feelings with a trusted colleague, some people journal or meditate. Provided any identif ying details of the case a re taken out, it is permissible and often important to discus s your feelings and rea ctions with a close f amily member or friend. When families say \"do n't tell\" Most pa tients eventually want to know their diagnosis and prognosis. Listen carefully to requests to withhold information. Assess whether the request makes sense within the family system, culture, or patient values, a nd respond accordingly.. Clinicians have a legal obliga tion to obtain info rmed consent f rom pa tients f or procedures and f or treatments. However. at times family members ask the clinicia n not to tell the patient the diagnosis or other important information, but effective therapeutic relationships generally require a meaningful alliance with f amilies. Ask them why they don't want you to tell the patient, wha t it is they are afraid you will say, or what their experience has been with bad news, rather than confronting their request with \"I have to tell the patient.\" Inquire whether there is a personal, cultural, or religious context f or their concern. Suggest tha t you go to the patient together to ask how much informa tion is desired about the situation and what questions there might be. After discussion with the patient, it ma y ultimately be decided that deta ils of diagnosis, prognosis and/or treatment will be discussed only with the f amily. However, unless the patient has previously indicated that he or she wants no information, hiding the dia gnosis or importa nt information about prognosis or treatment, especially if the patient is a sking to be fully informed, is neither ethical nor legally acceptable. These situations may require significant negotiation. In particularly difficult cases, support from the institutional ethics committee or palliat ive care consultants may be helpful. When language is a barrier Use experienced medical translators when delivering bad news to someone who speaks another language. Continue to use the 6 step protocol, but be certain to double check understanding a t each step. This same 6-\u00adstep protocol for communicating bad news can be used when the patient and clinician do not speak the same language. The assistance of an experienced translator who understands medical terminology a nd is comfortable tra nslating bad news is required. D o not use family members or untrained bilingual people as translators because this could confuse their roles in the family unit and may violate confidentiality. A lso, family members may have personal agendas a nd responsibilities that lead to miscommunications if they translate. Brief translators about the nature of the discussion before beginning the interview. If they are not experienced medical translators, reassure them their role is only to translate. Verify that they will be comfortable translating the news you are about to give. Arrange seating in a triangular fashion so that you can f ace and speak directly to the patient, yet still turn to look at the translator. Speak in short segments, and then give the translator time to convey the information. Verify that the patient and f amily understand, a nd check f or an emotional response. Communicat ing pro gnosis When discussing prognosis, give a range of time, such as hours to days, days to weeks, 3-\u00ad6 months, etc, Acknowledge that exceptions are frequent, in both directions, and that predictions are often incorrect. Communicate that your personal support will not wa ver, throughout the illness process. Patients and fa mily members frequently ask a bout prognosis. There are many motivations f or this request. Some want to have a sense of their future so they can plan their lives. Others are terrif ied and hope that you will reassure them that things are not so serious. Before directly answering questions about prognosis, inquire about reasons for asking. Questions might include: How specif ic do you want me to be? What experiences have you had with others with a similar illness? What have you been told about the future? Consider the implications of prognostic information you provide. Patients who wish to plan their lives want detailed information, while those who are terrif ied may do better with more general answers. More definitive answers, e.g., \"You probably have a bout 6 months\" are always risky because they produce disappointment if the time proves to be less, a nd anger o r frustration if you have underestimated the patient' s lifespan. Consider giving a range of time that encompasses an a verage life expectancy \"On average patients with your condition live\"...\" to to weeks,\" \"weeks to years,\" etc. Then follow with, \"Of course, there can be exceptions in either direction - you mig ht live longer than expected and we will do everything in our power to make that happen; but you also mig ht live shorter, so you should probably attend to critical matters soon, just in case.\" Emphasize the limits of prediction, \"What this will mean f or you I can't tell. We'll have a better sense over time how thing s will evolve f or you.\" Good studies show that lifespan estimates, even by the most experienced clinicians, are seldom on target, and of ten differ from reality by many months, or even years. Clinicia ns tend to be optimistic in an a ttempt to preserve hope, and ungrounded optimism fosters a f alse hope and unrealistic expectations. Always caution pa tients and f amilies that unexpected surprises can happen. Suggest tha t it is generally a dvisable to get critical affairs in order so they won' t be as vulnerable in case things progress sooner rather than later. Reassure them that you will be available to help with issues and support them throughout their illness, wha tever happens. Cl arify what ca n be realistically expected and distinguish this from what might be wished for, or what is most feared. Identify the miraculous for what it is\u2014something that happens exceedingly rarely. It may be helpful to say something like \"we need to both hope f or the best, while we simultaneously plan for the worst. We can' t predict surprises and should plan in case something happens sooner than we ar e hoping for.\" Death no tificat ion Notifying people about a loved one's death is challenging and stressful. This is doubly true f or covering doctors who have not had prior interactions with the family. Notifications often take place on the telephone. Clinicians should carefully prepare, identif y who should be contacted, and follow the 6-\u00adstep protocol described above. Always promptly inform families of a grave turn of events. When patients do die, most agree that it is pref erable to present death notif ication in person. If no family is present in the facility, however, telephone notifica tion is often preferable to delay. If using the telephone, call as soon as possible. Prepare carefully for a telepho ne no tificat ion, following the steps belo w: Positively identify the patient (hospital ID bracelet) and confirm dea th. Obtain relevant inf ormation; e.g. patient's name, a ge, gender, SS# and other ID numbers. Obtain the full name, a ddress, phone number(s) of the person/s you are calling. Try to establish f rom the chart a nd nursing staff the relationship of the contact to the deceased patient. Establish the circumstances of death; expected or sudden. Write down the key information you need and review wha t you will say. Find a quiet or private area.. Telepho ne co nversat ion 1. Identify yourself; ask the identity of the person you are ta lking to and their rela tionship to the patient. Ask to speak to the person closest to the pa tient (ideally, the health care proxy or the contact person indicated in the chart). Until you have verified the identity of the person to whom you are speaking, do not respond to any direct question. Ask if the contact person is alone. D o not give death notif ication to minor children. 2. Ask what they know about the pa tient's condition: \"What have the doctors told you about ____' s condition?\" 3. Provide a warning shot: \"I'm afraid I have some very bad news.\" 4. Use clear and direct but sensitive language, without medical jargon; \"I' m sorry, ____ has just died.\" Use words like \"dead\" or \"died\"; avoid using \"expired\", \"passed away\" or \"didn't make it\" which ca n be misinterpreted. Never deliver the news of death to an answering machine or voice mail. Instead, leave specif ic conta ct information. If you cannot make conta ct within 1-\u00ad2 hours, contact a hospital representative (e.g. Social Worker). Speak clearly and slowly, a llow time f or questions; be empathic. 5. If the family chooses to come to see the body, arrange to meet them personally, or designate the best possible person to substitute f or you. 6. Provide contact information f or the clinician or hospital off icial who ca n meet with them and answer questions about the patient' s death and other administrative issues. 7. Ask if you can contact anyone for them. Assess their emotional reaction. Briefly assess their safety (suicidality, ability to drive). 8. If you feel uncomf ortable about telephone notification, ask for help. Not telling t he news o ver the telepho ne? In rare circumstances, it may be appropriate to ask family members to come to the hospital, rather than telling them about a death by telephone. Factors to consider in deciding whether the risk of potential harm f rom abrupt disclosure of death warrants delaying notif ication include the following: the anticipated emotiona l reaction of the contact person, based on prior information; the contact person's level of understanding; whether the conta ct person will be alone when receiving the information; distance, availability of transport, and time of day. The notifier must decide whether to describe the patient as gravely ill and request that the contact person come to the hospital immediately. If you decide to delay disclosure of the death, make immediate admission of such nondisclosure as soon as you meet the fa mily (e.g. \"I' m sorry for not telling you right away over the phone\" then give your rea son for doing so).\"I'm So rry\" Saying \"I'm sorry\" intends to communicate an empathic expression of sorrow, but is easily misinterpreted. Attend to the verbal and non-\u00adverbal responses to saying \"I'm sorry,\" so you can identify and correct misinterpretations. \"I am so sorry t hat this happened t o you.\" is generally intended as an empathic expression of sorrow, acknowledging and sharing the sadness and unfairness of the situation. By expressing sorrow, clinicians express their human feelings of connection to the pa tient - that the patient's loss has touched them as a person. Clinicians must remain aware that genuine expressions of sorrow can be misinterpreted, and should not be made prematurely. If \"I'm sorry\" is sa id prematurely the statement may shortcut a deeper understanding. Patients' and families' own expression of loss ma y be limited. Perha ps better to begin with \"tell me the most dif ficult part...\" (or similar) before expressing empathy with \"I' m sorry\". Below a re several ways that the empathic expression \"I'm sorry...\" can be misinterpreted by patients or f amilies. By paying careful attention to the patient's verba l and nonverbal response to the clinician' s saying \"I' m sorry\", misunderstandings can be identified and c orrected quickly if they occur. They co nfuse empathy wit h sympathy, o r even pity, thinking you are saying: \"I feel sorry f or you\". They co nfuse empathy wit h apo logy, thinking you are saying: \"I am sorry that I contributed to your suff ering; or \"I hope that you can forgive me f or my role in what happened\". They t hink yo u are changing t he subject fro m patient and family t o clinician, looking for them to say: \"It's okay, doctor; you did the best you could\". Hopes and Wishes Do not give false hope, and, do not deny all hope. Help patients reframe hopes. Make statements that you \"wish things were diff erent\", which ca n simultaneously express empathy and acknowledge the emotional impact of bad news. Patient s frequently make statements about hope during a discussion regarding ba d news. Sometimes they say they hope to get well or to live a norma l life span, and at other times they may describe f eeling a complete lack of hope. Honesty should prevent clinicia ns from giving fa lse hope, yet denying all hope is just as damaging. The parallel requirement f or honesty and hope present a communication dilemma in bad news conversations. An adequate discussion of hope reflects the fact that goals necessarily change as situations a lter. For example, instea d of hoping for a long life, focus the patient on hoping for quality of life, freedom from suffering, or living until a certain milestone, if this is plausible. A more general type of hope is a sense that things will get better and that the patient will f ind pea ce. Ask patients what they are hoping for and help them to reframe their hopes into something they are likely to receive. (Module 32, 34) S peaking of \"wishes\" allows patients and clinicians to express a fleeting hope that the patient's circumstances could be different, to join together and temporarily suspend reality.\"I wish we had mo re effect ive treat ment for your conditio n.\" \"I wish I had so me o ther kind of news to give yo u.\" \"I wish t hings had t urned o ut better fo r you.\" By characterizing statements a s wishes, the clinicia n underscores that what is being hoped for is unlikely. This expression, \"I wish we had more eff ective treatment for your condition,\" is different from sa ying something hopeful that may not be connected to reality, such as, \"I ho pe we can f ind effective treatment.\" Whether such statements represent true hope or false hope depends both on the genuineness of the statement, and on the reality of whether effective treatments are available. Do not say, \"We are hoping to find more treatment f or your condition,\" unless there is a reasonable chance of finding such trea tment. Instead, express your hope as a wish that simultaneously a cknowledges the fa ct that it is unrealistic. \"I wish that we had more eff ective treatments tha t we could off er you.\" Statements in the form of wishes a cknowledge your limited ability to control medical matters and your regret that medicine is not more powerful and eff ective. Wish statements a re most helpf ul when they begin a conversation. After such a wish stateme nt, patients might be invited to share their sa dness and loss more fully by being asked \"What has been the hardest part?\" or \"As you look to the future, what is your biggest worry?\" Once wishes and disappointments are fully explored, the patient, f amily, and clinician must begin a search together for new forms of hope a nd direction that are consistent with the pa tient's values. Medicine' s ability to cure or control disease is but one avenue of hope. The search for hope in other dimensions may include living successfully with the disease rather than curing it, exploring experimental therapy (only those which have not been shown ineff ective), being f ree of pain or other symptoms, achieving closure with f amily members, exploring spiritual or religious issues, or any of a number of personal short-\u00adterm goals. AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) CONCLUSION Learning to deliver bad news with honesty, compassion and attention to individua l needs and preferences is a core clinica l skill that will only improve if you practice and attend carefully to the impact of your bad news conversations with patients and families. \"I just couldn't believe he was talk ing about me.\" (A young patient ref lecting back on receiving the diagnosis of gastric cancer.) Clinicians have the privilege a nd task of delivering bad news almost every da y. Sometimes the news is bad no matter who is receiving it (gastric cancer), and other times it is experienced as bad because of personal experience (hypertension in a patient whose parent had a disabling stroke.) Following a delibe rate, six-\u00adstep process allows the clinician to become prepa red, a llows the patient to control the flow of information, suggests ways of responding to the emotions that inevitably accompany bad news, and suggests strategies f or joining with the patient to create an individua lized initial care plan. BEHAVIOR CHECKLIST Prepare yourself in advance of the encounterChoose a private spa ce and uninterrupted time, turn off pager. Always have tissues available. Sit down, shake hands with patient and f amily. Ask what the patient and family alrea dy know. Ask about readiness to receive news Tell a \"warning shot;\" such as, \"I do not have good news.\" Tell news in simple, direct language; pause Attentively listen, allow silence and note nonverbal responses Acknowledge, legitimize, and explore emotion before reassuring or telling more Tell additional information in small chunks; with pauses to assess reaction When telling prognosis, use a range of time; tell that exceptions occur in both directions Balance the shock of truthf ulness by expressing compassion; do not try to balance by distorting grim facts Tell key data again in initial conversation, and in follow up visits (patients and f amilies don't hear much after the initial diagnosis) Establish and agree on a concrete plan for immediate next steps. When telling bad news on the telephone, acknowledge emotion, keep call brief, and arrange face to face contact Tell patient and family tha t you will make certain they are not abandoned.

Clinicians may also f eel hopeless, but they can relieve considera ble suffering through directed interventions and compassionate communica tion Perhaps the pa tient with metastatic cance r has failed his third round of chemotherapy or the patient with left main coronary artery disease is ineligible for bypass surgery because of his compromised medical status. Perhaps the patient with dementia responded to treatment of her aspiration pneumonia but then a spirated a gain a week later. Clinicians sometimes feel they have little to offer such patients a s they approa ch the end of life. Patients in these situations often feel helpless; they f eel hopeless, isolated, f rightened, and in pain. They turn to their clinician for help in the physical, psychological, and spiritual domains. In fact the clinician has a great deal to offer. End-\u00adof-\u00adlif e care is a critically important, labor-\u00ad intensive f orm of medical care. Clinicians who are able to overcome their own sense of helplessness a re an inva luable resource for both patients and their families. Directed interventions and compassionate communica tions a llow them to to relieve suf fering and assure patients tha t they will not be abandoned WHAT DO DYING PATIENTS WANT? Among patients' key needs at the end of life are preparation f or death and avoiding suffering. Patients and fa mily members say that their physicans seldom offer sufficient emoti onal support and generally communicate poorly with them. When patients are asked what matters to them near the end of life, they talk about having trust and confidence in their doctors, about not being kept alive if there is little hope f or recovery; and about wanting open and honest communication about their disease. They also want to have good control of symptoms (primarily pain but also nausea, shortness of breath, etc.), to prepare f or death by f inding a spiritual peace, and to a chieve a sense of completion by saying goodbye a nd making amends. Other fa ctors that patients associate with a good quality of life at the end of life are avoiding hospital or ICU care, meditating, having a good relationship with a clinician, and being visited by a pastor. When f amilies look back on their relatives' dying experience, additional themes emerge. Families typica lly comment that one of the principal deficiencies in care wa s the paucity of emotional support, f rom clinicians, in the hospital, in the nursing home and at home. Home hospice care typically provides more support tha n care in other settings, but still has room for improvement. Both patients and their families agree that discussions with the clinicia n are particula rly crucial\u2014 and singularly lacking\u2014d uring the close of life. One f ourth of families report specif ically that clinician communication was poor. Fortunately, we know a great deal about how to communicate in ways that provide the emotional support and comfort that all seriously ill patients wish for. Share medical informatio n Assuring tha t patients understand that their clinician thinks they a re entering the f inal stage of life is a complex process, one tha t requires communicating empathy and support that is individua lized to the patient, the family and the medical particulars. Patients may enter the f inal stage of life abruptly with a highly malignant brain tumor, or move insidiously into a state of increasing f railty because of a chronic illness. As clinicia ns perceive that patients are moving toward the end of life, they must share t his understa nding of the medical f acts with patients, and inform them of the important implications for subsequent medical and personal decisions. Telling patients that their underlying health status has changed is an undertaking tha t must be accomplished with empathy, tact and communication of clinicians' unwavering support. Include families or significant others in joint dia logues unless such a step in impossible because of geography, culture or other obstacles. Experts on telling patients such bad news propose six steps tha t ensure a good process. D ocCom Module 33 sets out steps that will communicate support, understanding and a ccurate infromation in a compassionate f ashion that is calibrated to particular patients' needs and wishes a nd puts a plan, however partial and preliminary, in place. If the patient/family do not have questions or say little in response to the news, clinicians may probe gently, and \"ask\" (see Modules 9 & 10) for their perceptions or their concerns about what they've been told. This \"ask\" will usually elicit responses that allow clinicians to \"tell\" additional important inf ormation tha t is relevant to the particular situation. When a well established relationship is in place, using humor can be an ef fective and empathic strategy. Be certain to summarize whatever decisions and pla ns have been made. HOW LONG WILL I LIVE? PROGNOSIS Patients wa nt to know how much time they have, but uncertainty is often high, and many clinicians do not talk about prognosis in a skillful and compassiona te fashionBreaking the news, providing a diagnosis, naming the problem, and pla nning next steps are all important, but patients cannot make informed medical decisions\u2014or other decisions about their lives\u2014unless they understand their prognosis. In general, patients want to know their prognosis,while clinicians hesita te about prognosticating both because they worry about how to talk about the end of life without \"taking away hope\" and beca use they believe their predictions are likely to be inaccurate. How ever, a review of the medical literature found that while doctors tend to be over-\u00adoptimistic, their estimates are well correlated with actual survival. An important barrier to clinicia ns' disclosing prognostic information is discomfort with talking about imminent death, quite apart f rom any uncertainty associated with prediction. Examples of widely used and eff ectve statements are the following: \"Every one is different, but many pa tients with your condition only have a little time left.\" or, \"The statistics show that on avera ge, a patient with your condition lives nine months\". This formulation f ocuses on average life expectancy. Because of both patient and clinician urgency to gauge prognosis, considerable ef fort has gone into finding ways to make reasona ble estimates. Estimating survival is more d ifficult with chronic diseases such as obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure or dementia than with malignancies. However, researchers developed tools that can help with prognostication. One example is the Palliative Performance Scale (PPS), a simple 0 (dea d) to 100 (f ully inta ct) scale, that incorpora tes functional status, disease burden, and cognition. Using the PPS improves prognos tic accuracy. The consequences of failing to have a good grasp of reality are striking: in a study of over 900 patients hospitalized with advanced cancer, all of whom had a 50% chance of dying in the next six months, those who believed they were going to live longer than six months were fa r more likely to request life-\u00adprolonging treatment over comfort care. This tendency to seek aggressive measures wa s prominent in those who believed they had a greater than 90% chance of living longer tha n six months but whose clinicia ns estimated the odds at only 10% ELICIT PATIENTS' GOALS OF CARE Ask your patients what is important, and then determine whether their response is more like \"life-\u00adprolongation,\" \"maintaining f unction,\" or \"maximizing comfort.\" Once clinicians communicate a prognosis, patients are in a position to think about their own goals for their care. Clinicians might introduce this subject by asking, \"What is most important to you at this stage?\" Typically, patients communicate their desire to be at home a nd to spend time with family; perhaps they will indicate that they do not want to be a burden to others or that they do not want to suffer. After they respond, take the opportunity to deepen the conversation and ascertain whether unresolved conflicts between family members should be addressed, or whether remaining spiritual issues require attention, perhaps with the assistance of clergy. Continue the conversation by inquiring which of the three major goals of medical care matters most: life-\u00adprolongation, maintenance of function, or maximization of comfort. Acknowledge that most p atients have all three goals, but that trade-\u00adof fs are frequently necessary. Prioritizing patients' goals of care helps clinicians determine which medica l interventions would be most appropriate to present for further discussion with a given patient. Not infrequently, patients and their fa mily members disagree about the goals of care: typically, the patient favors a focus on comfort, but a spouse or ad ult child wants life-\u00adprolonging therapy. As you mediate a f amily meeting about the conflict, emphasize that you are an advocate for the patientand tha t you seek to honor his wishes by facilitating fa mily discussion. Consider offering video decision aids that depict the specif ic interventions commonly associated with the different goals of care. In one study of patients with advanced cancer who were given a verbal description of the goals of care, 26% said they wanted life-\u00adprolonging care, 52% said they wanted basic or limited care, and 22% wa nted comfort care; while of those randomized to watch a video, none wanted life-\u00adprolonging care, 4% wanted basic or limited ca re, and 91% wanted comfort care. Update go als During times when patients' health declines, tell patients about your perceptions of illness progress and ask again about their priority goals, which often change as the end of life is closer a t hand. At the time of diagnosis of life-\u00adthreatening illness, patients usually indicate that life-\u00adprolongation is their major goal. As long as cure is possible or the disease remains well-\u00adcontrolled, maximal medical therapy may be rea sonable - even including treatment in an intensive care unit, intubation or dialysis. Attempts at cardiopulmonary resuscitation may be appropriate in the event of cardiac arrest, though survival is rare in patients with terminal illness. As illnesses progress, maintenance of function often becomes patients' priority goal\u2014remaining as independent as possible and continuing to be able to see, hear, wa lk, and think. At this juncture, clinicians should clarify that vigorous trea tment of medical problems will continue, but that CPR, intubation, a nd ICU care are seldom consistent with this goal. Finally, when comfort becomes the major goal, clinicians should translate this into medical interventions that are consistent with this priority, such as antibiotics, oxygen, and pa in medication, and interventions which are inconsistent with the \"comf ort\" goal, such as surgery, hospitaliza tion, or CPR. Arrange consultat ion wit h palliat ive care When initia l diagnostic steps revea l that a life-\u00adthreatening illness is prese nt, open conversations about pallia tive care and arrange a consultation. Palliative ca re is a relatively new specia lty that focuses on symptom management, psychosocial support, and advance ca re planning. Palliative care consultation ca n be helpf ul at any stage of a life-\u00adthreatening illness and can be used even as curative therapy is continued. During conversations about planning for diagnostic a nd therapeutic steps, talk with seriously ill patients about palliative care. Because it is new, patients and f amilies may think you are declaring that \"the end is near,\" so you might introduce palliative ca re using a phrase like this one: \"....an added layer of support f or anyone with a serious illness.\" A growing medical literature shows that palliative care consultation improves quality of life for patients and may even prolong life: in one study of patients with advanced lung cancer, median surviva l was 4 months longer in the group randomized to palliative care plus oncologic care than in those receiving standard oncology care alone. AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) ARRANGE HOSPICE REFERRAL When patients desire only comf ort care, review hospice services with them and their f amilies, and arrange for an intake interview. As illness progresses and conversations a bout treatment goals reveal that the patient's overriding goal is now comfort, it is time to think about a referral to hospice. Hospice programs provide comprehens ive care f or patients with a prognosis of six months or less who agree to forgo \"cura tive\" treatments, and this care is prima rily home-\u00adbased. If the patient expresses interest in remaining at home, the clinician might say, \"You've told me you want to be as independent a nd comfortable as possible. Hospice care is the best way I know to help you achieve those goals. If you agree, a nurse from the program will come to the hospital or to your home and provide further information about their procedures and services.\" The benef its of Hospice care are multiple a nd include a nurse who makes home visits, the availability of an on-\u00adcall nurse 24/7, emotional support from a team that includes a social worker and chaplain, volunteer support, and bereavement services. The mention of \"hospice\" connotes imminent de ath to many people, or ma y suggest that the primary doctor is \"giving up\". In fact, not only can the primary ca re clinician remain the attending clinician during hospice ca re, but also services are most eff ective when patients a re enrolled f or more than just a few days. Discussions with patients and fa milies will clarify these issues, and include additional important facts such as that opioids, commo nly prescribed for serious illness, do not shorten life and do not imply tha t death is imminent. NEARING DEATH and SAYING GOOD-\u00adBYE Acknowledge your personal relationship with patients and fa milies a s death approaches. Say \"good-\u00adbye,\" and offer assistance to families. Clinicians often f eel sad as a patient nears death, especially when it's someone for whom they provided care over an extended period of time. Just as we cncourage patients who are dying to say goodbye to friends a nd family, f orgiving them f or any wrongdoing and ma king amends themselves, clinicians may wish to say goodbye to a dying patient. This is a n opportunity to state explicitly tha t the relationship has been personally meaningful. You might say, \"It's been a privilege to help take ca re of you; I'm g oing to miss you when you're gone.\" or, \"I don't know if I will see you aga in. I will always remember the colorful caps you crocheted that you wore when you came to see me af ter your chemotherapy, a nd your wry sense of humor.\" A hug - if culturally appropriate (Module 15)-\u00ad of ten communicates more than words. When patients die, the clinicia n relationship with the their f amilies often comes to an end as well. This represents a second l oss. The loss can be slightly mitiga ted by sending a condolence card ortelephoning family members. Families warmly appreciate an off er to help them with issues such as gaining access to an autopsy report, responding to questions a bout the actual cause of death or providing help in coping with the death. AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) CONCLUSION Communicating news about a diagnosis of life-\u00adthreatening illness, discussing prognosis, eliciting patients' goals, translating goals into interventions, providing psychosocial support, a nd saying goodbye are crit ically important interventions for all clinicians. Of ten, specialists such a s oncologists, ca rdiologists, pulmonologists, and others provide much of the care f or patients with advanced illness. Primary care clinicia n s will coordina te with the specialists as they shepherd patients through this intense a nd emotionally trying phase of life. While the ultimate outcome is death, other goals such as sympto m relief and patient and fa mily satisf action are greatly improved and augmented by steady an skillful communication among clinicians, patients, and families.

Questio ns fo r Reflect ion: 1. Imagine that you are a patient, and tha t a mistake or unforeseen complica tion occurred during your surgery that will probably require an amputation. Or, imagine tha t there wa s an unexpected severe complication due to a medicine that you or a close f amily member received. What information would you like, a nd how would you like to be told? 2. ... what could your clinician say and do to help you handle your intense feelings of loss, anger, and blame? 3. If you or a family member or a lawyer wanted to sue whoever made the mistake, what could your clinician or system do to mitigate the intensity of your urge to file suit? 4. Can you imagine communication strategies that your clinician could have utilized in advance of the mistake which might ease your conversations after the mistake is brought to light? 5. Remember a serious mistake that you made (or imagine one) and the subsequent conversations with the pa tient and f amily and colleagues. What were (might be) the painful moments, and what could people say or do to mitiga te your guilt, shame, anger, and defensiveness? Key Principles: 1. Contemporary standards of professionalism mandate that clinicians disclose errors and discuss unexpected outcomes. This is true whether I made the error or I discovered an error made by another clinician concerning a patient of mine. 2. Unexpected outcomes can be trivial or tragic, and might or might not involve errors. 3. Collaborative conversations a bout unexpected outcomes a re more likely if the clinician conducts an informed consent discussion in advance of such outcomes. 4. Intense feelings of anger, sadness, blame, shame, distrust a nd defensiveness are norma l when serious unexpected outcomes occur. 5. In the fa ce of tragic outcomes, honest disclosure and explicit acknowledgment of feelings not only help in ma intaining a positive relationship, but also reduce malpractice risk.6. When unexpected outcomes occur, clinicians need personal support from colleagues and administration. Learning go als: At the co nclusion o f this mo dule, yo u will be able to : List reasons why an informed consent dialogue helps to prevent undesired outcomes. Describe ethical and prof essional principles that support honest disclosure of errors. Describe seven key aspects of a disclosure discussion: setting the stage; reviewing background facts; responding to feelings; including everyone; avoiding hedging and conjecture; a pologizing; arranging f ollow up. Verbalize respectful responses to the feelings of patients, families a nd clinicia ns when communicating about medical error. Describe principles for managing common error situations involving other clinicians. ERROR IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM Both medical errors and unexpected outcomes without error a re common a nd deadly at times. They are due to biologic variability and incorrect judgments in complex situa tions. Every clinician and health professional makes errors. According to the Institute of Medicine report medical errors are the 8th leading cause of death in the United States, with medication errors alone accounting for over 7,000 deaths annually. \"Error\" often seems dif ficult to define because illness and medical care are so complex and uncertainty is so prevalent. A medical / legal definition is: \"Act of commission or omission with potential negative consequences f or the patient that would be judged wrong by skilled and knowledgeable peers at the time it occurred, independent of whether there were actually any negative consequences.\" Notice the important role played by medical peers, and tha t the actual outcome is not relevant. Many unexpected outcomes result from the biological variability of patient and illness: either the illness appears to be pa rticularly virulent, or the patient resistant to usual treatment. Un common, or \"low probability\" side ef fects a nd complications account f or many unexpected outcomes. Sometimes clinicians make judgments which prove incorrect, but without negligence; that is, the clinician recommends the wrong path when confronted with signif icant uncertainties. Some errors result from the complex interactions a mong members of the healthca re team and systems issues. Finally, every clinic ian occasionally makes frank errors. Patients and clinicians often have differing expect ations fo r success Patients and fa milies have high expectations for success and \"expectation mismatch\" is a major source of complaints a nd distress. In some cases patients and families have much higher expectations from treatment than their clinicians do. If these high expectations go uncorrected, an unwanted result might be called \"expectation mismatch.\" Clinicians, aware of the complexities of care, may be only slightly surprised by an unanticipated outcome. But the element of surprise may raise doubts and suggest the possibility of error to patients and families, regardless of whether the \"risks\" were mentioned prior to initiating treatment. Unexpect ed outcomes challenge clinicians Clinicians are disappointed and uncomfortable with unexpected outcomes, error or not. They worry about how to talk about them, and about blame, uncertainty and judgments. Clinicians have very high expectations of themselves, quite apart from their ideas of the cou rse of a particular treatment or procedure. Unexpected outcomes without error are rather common, so both patients and clinicia ns often have experience with them and can call on f amiliar coping strategies. On the other hand, when a clea r error of any kind results in some unwanted outcome, both patient and clinician experience great discomfort. The patient's trust is shaken. The presence of error challe nges the clinician' s sense of personal and professional integrity. They a sk themselves, \"Where did I go wrong?\" \"How could I miss the early warning signs?\" They may experience feelings of shame, doubt, sadness and anger at themselves. Sometimes when caring f or a patient we learn about possible errors made by another clinician. Discussion of such situations with patient, f amily and the previous clinici an presents many challenges. Some of the hurdles include fear of precipitating legal action against a colleague or becoming involved in such action, embarrassment during conversation a bout the situation with the other clinician and managing personal clinica l indignation when a serious error has clearly occurred. Some common concerns of clinicians include questioning the identity of the f inal arbiter of right and wrong care: who is to judge what appropria te care should be in an individual case? A nd, since so many errors occur without adverse consequences, how \"negative\" must the consequences to the patient be before the clinicia n is obliga ted to discuss the error with the patient? In addition, many medical errors have complex origins, involving teamwork and \"systems\" problems. Who is \"to blame\"? MUST PHYSICIANS DISCLOSE? Professional standards require that clinicians discuss unexpected outcomes and disclose errors, whether made by oneself or by another clinician. The responsibility to disclose is based on the intrinsic fiduciary relationship between patient and clinician, and is supported by contemporary ethica l standa rds and accrediting and professional bodies (see below). Furthermore, a clinicia n who ha s deceived a patient may not be defended or \"covered\" by his malpractice carrier. In court, \"deception\" may be a matter of perception rather than \"proof \". Honesty is the best policy. Not surprisingly, most patients and f amilies want and expect clinicians to discuss problems with treatment promptly and honestly. A personal, non-\u00addef ensive and open discussion usually reducesfeelings of betrayal and distrust, and anger is often soothed, making the sa dness and disappointment more tolerable. Mandate to disclo se: Joint Commission: requires hospitals to have an explicit policy a nd procedure for the disclosure to patients of adverse events, complica tions, with and without error. American College of disclose ...informa tion about....errors...if (it) signif icantly affects...the patient. Errors do not necessarily constitute improper, negligent, or unethical behavior.\" Disclo sure is unset tling Clinicians f ear conversations a bout disclosure, and they are of ten ill-\u00adprepared f or them. But cover-\u00adup and deception have worse consequences. Clinicians' fear of negative consequences f rom disclosing errors begins early, and pervades the current culture of medicine. In one study, only 54% of residents who made a serious mistake reported it to their fa culty attending. Clinicians often react in a \"fight or flight\" way, based on spontaneous emotional reactions that we hope will protect us\u2014but which seldom are effective, and may actually worsen the situation. We may try to distance ourselves or minimize possible errors: \"We all make mistakes...it's ha rd to be perfect...\" Another defense mecha nism is discounting or displacing responsibility: \"The hospital does not have enough staff...bad illness...patient did not comply...\" S ometimes we attempt to refute even the possibility of error through denial: \"Medicine is more art than science...there are only differences of opinion.\" Of course, there is usually some element of truth in these statements. Fear of disclosure operates between residents and faculty as well as between peers, and concea lment leads to the problems of secrecy such as fear, anger a nd retaliation if secrets a re discovered. In addition, guilt, shame and withdrawa l induced by \"cover-\u00adup\" inhibit learning and quality improvement. Clinicians in teaching institutions and clinicians who are members of interdisciplinary medical teams have a specia l obligation to model and teach appropriate disclosure and discussion of unexpected outcomes. In the event of an adverse outcome (or a perceived one), establishing rapport and rebuilding trust with colleagues, team members, patients a nd families during a disclosure and rela ted conversations is challenging and never simple. The a bility to engage empathically, clearly and supportively is greatly improved by simulation a nd \"rea l-\u00adtime\" practice of the skills outlined in this Module, according to a recent study. We encourage you to take advantage of both simulated and real opportunities for reviewing, learning and practicing the approa ches and techniques we discuss. Coping can be impro ved Denial, minimizing and def lecting blame can a nd should be replaced with intellectually honest, supportive and reflective collegial conversations. Clinicians have many concerns a bout how to discuss unexpected events, and little experience in managing the dif ficult emotions that arise. Clinicians usually feel disappointed, and the prospect of a complex a nd emotion-\u00adladen discussion or even a verbal attack increa ses persona l and professional discomfort. They worry about the impact on their lives and practices, teams, institutions and relationships. In part because causality may be hard to assess accurately, unexpected events raise clinicia ns' doubts about their own perf ormance, and clinicians worry thatdisclosure could awaken the patient's awareness a nd suspicions, increasing the likelihood of a malpractice claim. If you feel you have made a serious error, it can be very helpf ul to talk with a trusted colleague. Tell your colleague what happened, a nd your worries a nd feelings about it. Many errors are errors in retrospect only, and ma ny times your colleagues may tell you they would have made similar decisions. If you ma de a clea r error, talking with a trusted colleague can help you think clearly about it, help you forgive yourself, and learn from the mistake. Denial and avoidance of your feelings can keep you f rom learning and ma y prolong your own emotional suffering. Also, in the evolving era of disclosure, discussing the error with your hospital risk management staff provides perspective and hleps prepare f or your disclosure conversation. \"EXPECTATION MISMATCH\" AND INFORMED CONSENT The informed consent process helps assure tha t clinicia n and patient share expectations and basic understanding of the situation, and minimizes the chance of expectation mismatch. When introduced a few decades ago, informed consent seemed almost a formality, a \"cover your butt\" piece of paper with some mention of risks, a nd a signature. This has changed, and present professiona l and ethica l expectations are that the informed consent \"f orm\" certifies that patient and clinician have shared an open and frank (but not bruta l) discussion. Clinicians use their best communication skills to inform patients as collaboratively a nd empathically as is feasible. Clinician and pa tient should have a simila r idea of what is most \"likely\" to occur, and also of what could occur, negotiating expectations along the worst case-\u00adbest case spectrum to prevent mismatch. In some institutions it is unclear whose role it is to obtain informed consent -\u00ad clinician, nurse, resident, or clerk. The clinician is ultimately responsible for the care delivered. Consequently, patients (and lawyers) consider the informed consent process to be the clinician' s responsibility, regardless of who obtains the patient's signature on the inform ed consent document. Elements o f info rmed consent A consent conversation explores perspectives, options, and uncertainties. Any inf ormation tha t is presented must be tailored according to language, cultural and litera cy concerns. An adequate conversation can minimize mismatches, distrust and conflict if disappointing outcomes occur. Module 17 presents informed decision making in depth. Here we off er a summary of the specif ic issues rela ted to informed consent discussions. Patients need a clea r framing of the clinical issues and discussion of options for diagnosis and treatment, with presentation of potential benef its and risks. Survey uncertainties a ssociated with diagnosis and treatment. Take time to discover whether the patient, the family or the clinicia n thinks certain alternatives are not \"acceptable\". Explore the patient's and f amily' s perspective (Module 9). Include their ideas about the nature of the disease, concerns a bout treatment alternatives, prior experience with healthcare, and potential conflicts based on different cultural or social expectations, in order to tailor the care and anticipate future diff iculties. Tailor information to the patient's needs and interests in order to establish a shared understanding a nd mutually agreed plan of action (Modules 10 and 11.) Be certain that patients have ample opportunity to raise concerns, especially as youapproach closure, and tha t they are able to summarize the plan in a way that demonstrates their understanding (Module 12). Conversations about complex matters such as treatment with multiple a ntibiotics or cardiac medications or for hyperthyroidism should be documented in the medical record, even when no pa tient signa ture is required. Consent forms signed by the patient that are required for procedures, certain drugs and surgery should include documentation a bout the conversations that precede the signing. An effective inf ormed consent dialogue does not prevent disappointing outcomes, but it assures that the patient and clinician have shared their thoughts and concerns about the goals and potential risks of a course of treatments or a procedures. The process strengthens relationship bonds and supports trust, especially in the event of a tragic or very unexpected outcome, with or without medical error. Those bonds and t he increa sed trust permit subsequent conversations to be more open, more dignified and more empathic in spite of the distress. ARRANGE DISCUSSION ABOUT UNEXPECTED OUTCOMES: After unexpected outcomes, attending clinicians should initiate discussion promptly, arrange an appropriate private setting, enga ge families, and ensure seating f or all participants. Assist residents and obtain administrative suppor t. In this section you'll f ind the following topics covered: 1. Begin discussio n before initiating treat ment 2. Meet Promptly 3. Privat e sett ing 4. Engage t he family Begin dialo gue prio r to treat ment Conversation about unexpected outcomes begins prior to treatment, continues during active treatment, and picks up where it left off if unanticipated events ensue. Prior to treatment, the informed consent process serves to minimize misunderstanding and mismatched expectations. During active treatment, the dialogue includes discussion of treatment goa ls, progress and f uture planning, with description of any deviations f rom the expected course of treatment and active elicitation of patients' concerns. Arrange meeting promptly As with any \"bad news\" conversation, arrange a meeting with the pa tient and f amily as the clinical situation and circumstances allow , as soon as possible. If telephone discussion is required by the circumstances, tell the basic facts that demand a face-\u00adto-\u00adf ace meeting for further talk. D on't waitfor all the \"fa cts\" or for a complaint or question. \"I don't have a ll of the information yet, but I need to tell you what I do know at this point. We will meet again as more information is ava ilable.\" You may be inclined to postpone, but delays usually magnif y problems, and may be perceived as an attempt to conceal or obfuscate issues. Privat e sett ing Talk in a private area, such as a conf erence room, office or private patient room, and close the door. If conversations begin unexpectedly in a public area such as the emergency department or a hallway, have everyone take a breath and loca te a more private area. Privacy is far more important than any inconvenience. Assure seating f or everyone, a nd be especially certain that the clinicians are seated (Module 14). Engage t he family Explore family roles a nd care-\u00adgiving relationships, and respond to the family dynamics, conflicts and dif ferences. The importance of f amilies cannot be overstated, both in the informed consent process and in the event of unexpected outcomes. Family members' roles diff er enormously (Module 20, 32-\u00ad34), but elicitation and documentation of certain basic information is essential if conversations about unexpected outcomes are to be successful. Find out what f amily members, f riends, and other clinicians have sa id and advised. Make an effort to identify diff icult relationships and dif ferences of opinion within the family. Make notes a bout how well you know the fa mily members, their relationships and the living a nd care-\u00adgiving arrangements that include the patient. Clarify what involvement the patient and individual family members f eel is beneficial, appropriate, and desirable. When there are differences of opinion or if family ideas are in possible conflict with what you think, discuss these in an open manner. (Module 20) DIALOGUE STRATEGIES AND SKILLS Bring assistants when discussing serious problems, a nd assure that any residents who lead such conversations have specific tra ining and guidance. All staff participants should be prepared: read the chart ca refully and know not only the facts of the case but also know which issues remain as yet unclear. Whenever there is serious injury-\u00ad-\u00adwith or without error-\u00ad-\u00ada second person, preferably from hospital administration, is essential to witness the conversation, facilitate, support the patient and family, and coordinate follow-\u00adup. In a non-\u00adteaching institution, the attending or covering clinicia n at thetime of the event takes responsibility for initiating a nd leading the discussion. In a teaching hospital or clinic, initiation and leadership depends on the severity and acuity of the situation, the experience of the resident, and any special characteristics of the institution. Inexperienced residents should be adequately prepared and accompanied by a senior resident or faculty clinician as they conduct the conversation. Students may be present, but should not lead discussion. In serious cases, or where there is possible or obvious error, the faculty clinician takes the lead, and negotiates the role of the resident before the meeting. These conversations are a high stakes learning opportunity and caref ul prepa ration ca n assure maximum educa tional benef it.

Students may be present, but should not lead discussion. In serious cases, or where there is possible or obvious error, the faculty clinician takes the lead, and negotia tes the role of the resident before the meeting. Mindful appro ach Conversation should be timely, but not begun until you have discussed the situation with supportive colleagues or administrators, a nd taken steps to calm yourself so that you can remain mindful. In discussion wit h other personnel, decide who will review the situation, who answers clinical questions, and how to describe different roles. If there are administrative issues and concerns or financial questions, enlist help from administrative personnel. D o not a ttempt to answer questions you are unsure of, such as whether the hospital will pay f or prolonged care. \"I don't know how to answer your questions a bout th e extra cost, but I will find the right person for these issues.\" Clinicians appropria tely anticipate conflict and dif ficulty when joining the patient and fa mily f or discussion of unexpected outcomes. Take a mindful a pproach and notice your own emotions. Remember prior related events, and especially those when you were in the shoes of patient or family. Remember how and from whom you obtained support then, a nd anticipate who will support you now. You might begin with deep breaths or other stra tegies (Module 2, 4) to help settle feelings and calm your mind. Dialogue elements and sequence Take responsibility for introductions, a compassionately delivered opening statement of bad news and an apology. Follow up with a clear summary, attentiveness to patient and family concerns and acceptance of them, check f or understanding and continue to respond with empathy. Take the lead, introduce everyone, and then review their roles and relationships. Warn the patient/f amily. \"I am afraid I have s ome bad news.\" Then, a simple initial a pology and brief explanation informs people of your compassion and respect for their strengths, which is very helpful at the outset of a complicated discussion. Patients and fa milies depend on and expect professiona lism. At such times of disappointment a professional demeanor includes and demonstrates both attentiveness to others and thoroughness regarding the details. Do not hurry, and especia lly in situations when you feel urgency, do not allow this to override your attentiveness or give an impression of ca sualness. Review the course to date (diagnosis, goals, choices made a nd why). Recall the informed consent dialogue, but do not suggest tha t the disappointing event should come as no surprise (it always does). Describe the event succinctly but clearly and p ause, indicating your interest in questions and responses. Check for patient and family understanding, and clarify a nd resolve a ny differences that emerge. Anticipate common concerns and ask a bout them, even if others do not initiate discussion. \"What questio ns do you have abo ut why t his happened when t hings were go ing so well?\"Listen f or and understand the core of the patient's distress, remembering t hat their concern may not be immediately obvious, or obscured by confusion or other emotions. Reflect and respond to the emotional messages because these reflections help the patient find her core emotions a nd express them. Strive f or accurate understanding and acknowledgement of feelings, ideas and concerns. \"This is a co mplex situatio n. What wo rries you mo st?\" Conclude the conversation with a joint di scussion about the future. Include a negotiation of the immediate goals and expectations of care and possible complica tions or risks, and arrange support and future meetings as needed. \"If you have no further quest ions, let's talk abo ut the coming days...\" Commo n Dialogue Dilemmas With a careful approach and skills practice, clinicians can avoid common communication problems, such as premature reassuranc e, responding defensively, fa iling to apologize, and neglecting to talk about who will take continuing responsibility for the patient's care. In this section, the following issues are covered: 1. Premature reassurance 2. Feeling defensive 3. Offering apolo gy4. Assure co ntinuing care Premature reassurance Premature reassurance hinders open dialogue, while empa thy and acceptance build trust. Do not offer premature reassurance, because this is of ten interpreted as minimizing the experience of the patient and the family. \"I wish I co uld reassure yo u that everyt hing will be all right, but I am afraid this might be premature.\" Empathize and fully accept disa ppointments and doubts, usi ng reflective listening and other relationship building skills that foster trust (Module 6, 13) When patients f eel understood, upset feelings are soothed. On the other hand, fa iling to acknowledge strong feelings, trying to minimize them, or turning a way from feelings to the facts, even in an attempt to reassure, usually exacerbates strong feelings and hinders open dialog. When the patient indicates h e feels that you do understand his distress, review any good news that exists. \"I kno w that this is very wo rriso me, but I wo uld also like to describe some reaso ns fo r hope.\" Feeling defensive Defensive f eelings a re normal, but expressing them blocks supportive discussion. Avoid the natural tendency to defend yourself. Express empathy and respect instead of your own defensive feelings. \"It must be hard to trust us aft er what has happened.\" Defensiveness evokes suspiciousness and distrust. Defensiveness has the eff ect, if not the intention, of appearing to place yourself a nd your position at the center, in a time of crisis for the patient. Remember that they are the ones who are sick, no matter how sick at heart you ma y feel. Offer apolo gy Apology is difficult and complex. Genuine apology is compassi onate and expresses sincere concern. Clinicians often worry that their apology is an admission of fault, or may be construed as an admission of \"guilt\". The simplest \"apology\" might better seen as a statement of compassion and concern, or a general expression of sympathy f or the situation. \"I am sorry about what yo u have been t hrough this week.\" \"I am sorry t hings turned o ut this way\". Such statements are effective at conveying concern, do not constitute a ny admission of responsibility a nd are very important to patients.A more complex \"a pology\" underscores the fa ct that you take personal responsibility for your work. \"I am sorry I did no t cont act you sooner abo ut the laborato ry results.\" \"I am very I nicked the bile duct during surgery.\" Clearly this does convey both remorse a nd responsibility. When there is error involved, this kind of statement is uncomf ortable to deliver, but is very reassuring to patients and eff ective at allaying their worries about your honesty, trustworthiness and potential betra yal of your fiduciary relationship. When there has been error, patients expect a n apology, and f ailing to apologize angers people, sometimes increasing the likelihood of conflict and future claims. In court, your apology is \"discoverable\". However, should problems come to court, it is better to have previously acknowledged the discovera ble issue than to have it discovered during the litigation pr ocess, which convinces people that you wanted to conceal fa cts and avoid taking responsibility, and increa ses their anger and vengefulness. Assure co ntinuing care Do not fail to assure patients tha t you will take responsibility for ensuring a continuing care relationship. When situations turn out ba dly, patients are apprehensive about feeling abandoned. If they sense that you are pulling away from them, they become angry and more litigious. You and the patient may not have a prior or continuing doctor-\u00adpatient relationship. If the possibility exists f or one, maintain a continuous dialogue and relationship with the patient and fa mily. \"We should t alk about the days to come. I need to stay in clo se co mmunicat ion wit h you so that yo u can underst and what is happening and I can hear and address yo ur concerns.\" If this is a one-\u00adtime encounter such as an emergency department visit, or a time/role limited relationship such as occurs in ma ny hospital situations, clarify a nd reinforce the role of the primary care or specialty clinician who will be assuming care, without minimizing your involvement in the present situation. \"It is important that I speak as so on as po ssible with yo ur primary care clinician so we can assure co ntinuit y of care.\" TRAGIC OUTCOMES AND ERRORS Unexpected death, any major complication or a ny error produces very strong emotions and reactivity is high. Clinicians need support setting up and conducting conversations about tragic outcomes. In conversations regarding \"major\" complications or clear errors, emotions and disappointment are stronger, particula rly the clinicia n feelings of de fensiveness, denial, guilt, remorse and concern about malpractice suits. The strategies and skills described above for unexpected outcomes are appropriate and relevant, but certain elements deserve more emphasis. Your first priority should be to seek help and advice, particularly to help identify a nd manage your emotions, and to help you remain mindful of the total picture, not just the present events . Take the time to review the case before you start the discussion, with a focus on what must be done atthis time and wha t and how much is best to discuss. Review a ny tra ining you received on how to respond to and discuss unexpected outcomes and errors in the context of your own institution. Talk with your risk management department, your immediate clinical supervisor or department cha ir, or other appropriate personnel. Honesty, det ail, criticism, and empathy Dilemmas common to tragic situations include the question of amount of detail needed in the conversation, avoidance of unnecessary controversy, a nd avoidance of blaming language when another clinicia n or institution is involved. Honesty is never wrong, a nd apology, acceptance of responsibility a nd avoidance of hedging and blaming are fundamentally important to showing that you care deeply about the patient and family, but judgment is required regarding the level of detail to provide. Remember that too much detail can increase confusion for non-\u00adclinicians and make people think there is more that you are covering up. D escribe f acts and answer questions willingly. Be certain to use language that acknowledges a nd defines area s of uncertainty. \"There are so me things we know fo r sure and o thers which remain unclear...\" Dishonesty (real or perceived) is noticed, a nd breeds distrust. Apologize. Be sincere. Accept responsibility without detailed self-\u00adcritical ana lysis. Save self-\u00adcriticism for forums other than with the patient and family; your clarity about what did happen is more important than what might have been. D o not make statements about wha t you \"should\" ha ve done, such as, \"I really should have reviewed the literature more carefully and ma ybe obtained a consultation.\" Avoid conjecture th at might imply bla me. \"It's hard to know exact ly what I wo uld have do ne if I had been t here...I'm afraid we will have to wait until the sit uation has been fully investigat ed.\" Empathize with disa ppointments, without taking a position. \"The impact of this is just so t errible....I wish I co uld tell yo u exactly why t his all happened.\" Transfer, atto rneys, disco very Offer to transfer care; never talk with patie nts about your conversa tion with attorneys or insurers, and remember that all conversations are discoverable except for Quality Assura nce proceedings. When major problems occur, someone always wonders whether a transf er of care is appropriate. Even if patient or f amily do not bring it up, offer this option as a compassionate response to the pain and other strong emotions that are near the surface. Yo ur offer acknowledges that a natural human reaction might be that continued healthy collaboration could seem too difficult for the patient to manage. Such a respectful off er will not be misinterpreted. \"I wo uld like t o remain yo ur clinician, but I understand you may have so me feelings about this. If you would like, I will help yo u find anot her clinician.\" Never discuss with the patient any of your cons ultations with attorneys, personnel acting under attorney' s direction, or your liability insurer' s personnel; these must be kept confidential. Anypotential or pending disciplinary actions a gainst you or other medical personnel must similarly be kept entirely in confidence. \"I am afraid I canno t discuss what t he ho spital investigat ion has fo und, but I am happy to answer whatever questio ns I can.\" The proceedings of Medical Staf f Peer Review committee meetings and case review are protected. However, outside of this protected Quality Assura nce arena, the content of informal discussions and meetings such as Morbidity and Mortality conferences are potentia lly discoverable. HIPAA regulations and associated hospital privacy policies also influence the f reedom we have to discuss the details of cases a mong ourselves. B e sure to consult your practice's legal af fairs department. ERROR BY A COLLEAGUE In situations where a colleague may have committed a n error, respond with empathy and avoid both conjecture a nd def ensiveness. Organize a \"disclosure c onversation\" after obtaining consultation f rom Medical D irector or senior collea gues. A circumstance that is awkward and sometimes thorny is the assumption of care for a patient who may have been harmed by another clinician' s actions. The patient and the family will typically ask your opinion of the previous clinicia n's care. Questions such as: \"Was it a mistake f or Dr. A to prescribe Drug XYZ that ca used this terrible reaction;\" \"Dr. A should have prescribed treatment for atrial f ibrillation before dad had the stroke, isn't that right;\" \"Why didn't the ra diologist report this finding ?\" When such questions arise, the clinician to whom care is transf erred is likely to experience ma ny concerns and emotional responses, including the following: \"I am really upset with Dr. A for making this mistake;\" \"Dr. A should be asha med of this;\" \"I am ashamed to be working in the same institution as Dr. A;\" \"I know Dr. A is too smart to ma ke the mistake the patient is worried about;\" \"Did Dr. A really make a mistake?\" \"What are the full facts related to this situation?\" \"How much can I tell / disclose to the patient?\" \"With whom should I (or can I) discuss this situation?\" Because we seldom know the full story, our sense of professionalism and ethics is challenged - particularly on the occasion when we initially hear about a possible error. Whether an egregious error seems obvious, or the patient seems to have misinterpreted a complex situation, we may be tempted to share our thoughts about a lapse, or conversely, to def end a colleague' s clinical work. We are simultaneously reluctant to criticize a colleague, or to withhold the \"truth.\" Furthermore, appropriate concerns a bout potential litigation cloud judgment. This difficult dilemma is common and it usually arises unexpectedly during a busy day. Few clinicia ns have rehearsed how they might respond professionally and adequately. As with other \"difficult conversations,\" calling on principles discussed in prior Modules - notably those on strong emotions (Module 13), balance (Module 4), bounda ries (Module 41) patient perspective (Module 9) and sharing information (Module 10) fully a pply here. Key principles f or talking about a colleague's clinica l work include the following:Disclose what is known for certain, specify what still needs to be ascertained, and avoid conjecture; Acknowledge patients' and f amilies' emotiona l reactions, a nd become aware of your own; Call for assistance from a dministration or the legal depa rtment in high risk situations; Set up a conversation with the colleag ue whose care is in question. Gallagher a nd colleagues recently published a table of guidelines for choosing participants for conversations: Table 1. Disclo sing Harmful Errors in Co mmo n Situations Invo lving Other Clinicians (adapted) For this situat ion... Choo se these participant s... Error by clinician at your institution Attending clinician and prior clinician Error involving trainee or interprof essional colleagueAttending clinician and (if appropriate) whoever made the error Error by non-\u00adpatient contact clinician at your institution (e.g. radiologist)Attending clinician, a nd invite the colleague Error unrelated to current care (e.g. something previously missed)Medical D irector (or similar); invite current attending clinician Error by clinician from another instituti onMedical D irector (or similar), af ter consultation with other institution's Medical Director; invite current attending Suppo rt for Colleagues The dynamics of supporting colleagues are complex. Approach your colleagues in a non-\u00ad judgmenta l fashion, with empathy and respect. Simultaneously, help discover as much of the truth as possible under the circumstances. In fact, unexpected outcomes are discussed frequently. D iscussions range from \"morbidity and mortality\" conferences and hall-\u00adway conversations to peer review root-\u00adcause analysis a nd institutionalized support groups. Some resemble a n inquisition, others an aca demic exercise, still others a means of condolence. Conversations among colleagues should mirror those with patients and families: prompt, respectful, honest, empathic, problem-\u00adsolving, su pportive, and with a focus on learning for the future. Clinicians have specific needs when an error occurs. Ca rrying lif e and death responsibility can be lonely, and is never simple. Clinicians feel disappointed and unha ppy, and apprecia te the opportunity to say so. Clinicians need to understand wha t went wrong, and how to prevent it in the future. They need to feel understood and supported by colleagu es, in both their f eelings a nd their medical practice. Establishing a balance between dealing realistically and honestly a bout questions of clinica l judgment while a voiding contributing to a clinician's feeling of shame or guilt is as delicate a process as talking with patients and fa milies. When talking with a colleague who has had a serious adverse outcome, build trust and relationship that ca n suppo rt a frank exploration of the situation. Express empathy: \"I can imagine yo u feel pretty badly abo ut this.\"Keep it simple; wa it for your colleague to respond and do not minimize. Try to facilitate understanding of the case, when and if a ppropriate. Ask permission first: \"If you'd like, I wo uld he happy t o talk abo ut the case with yo u...I wo nder what happened...\" Avoid shame and alienation: \"I've made so me bad mistakes and kno w I felt pretty badly afterwards. Still, I ho pe you don't feel t oo ashamed t o talk with me abo ut the case. I've always respect ed your judgment and t his won't change o ur relat ionship.\" Support your colleague, without condescension: \"What can I do to help you get thro ugh this? I want you t o know I value o ur partnership.\" Two mo vies abo ut having a dialo gue wit h an angry patient who suspects yo u of being t he cause fo r her suffering Click on the picture-\u00adbutton above to see a movie ho w no t to deal with a n angry patient who suspects you of being the cause of her suffering.Click on the picture-\u00adbutton above to see a movie ho w to deal with a n angry patient who suspects you of being the cause of her suffering. AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) RELEVANT BEHAVIORS Informed consent Check patient's perspective: what does she believe is the dia gnosis and the prognosis without treatment; then share additional information as needed to educate her about the diagnosis. Ask the patient what she knows a bout treatment options, and their benef its and risks, and then share information so that you can a ssure the patient' s understanding. Ask the patient to summarize her understanding of the management plan and ensure that you have a chieved a shared understanding. Involve the family according to the patient' s wishes.Unexpect ed outcomes Discuss and review the treatment process. Compare treatment progress with treatment goals established during informed consent process. Preface disclosure of an unexpected outcome by warning the patient of impending ba d news. Describe unexpected outcomes (with or without error) succinctly. Ask patients how they would like their f amily involved. Actively elicit questions, feelings and concerns, a nd respond without defensiveness. Make empathic statements a nd use reflective listening skills tha t acknowledge and accept patients' and f amilies' feelings and concerns. When a n unexpected outcome without error occurs, express personal concern. When a n error has been made, accept responsibility. When a n error has been made, apologize. Ask whether the patient is ready to talk about immediate and f uture care. Obtain professional and persona l assistance when an error has been made. LITERATURE REFERENCES 1.

Continuity of care and non-\u00adabandonment are central principles of all medical care 2. Clinicians have a duty to minimize clinical, emotiona l, behavioral and logistical difficulties caused by transfer of care 3. In both \"good\" a nd not-\u00adso-\u00adgood relationships, adherence to relationship centered communication principles promotes mutual respect and satisfactory separa tions / transfers of car Learning go als: At the co nclusion o f this mo dule, yo u will be able to : Describe typical psychological and behavioral impacts of clinician-\u00adpatient separations, for both clinicia n and patient. List 3 patient characteristics that increase vulnerability to transfer of care. List 3 topics that should be covered in discussions of transfer of ca re. List 3 reasons why patients request transfer of care. Review with a patient the steps and procedures for the transfer of care to a new clinicia n Elicit patient perspectives and feelings about transfer, and respond with empathy to typical \"negative\" reactions such as sadness, anxiety and anger INTRODUCTION More frequent and disruptive transfers of care are ta king place than ever before. Mobile patients, changes in practice ownership, a nd continuous insurance and financial fluctuations contribute to the disorder . Clinicians must learn to minimi ze the adverse consequences f or themselves a nd their pa tients. Case 1: Dr. C has ca red for Mrs. N, 68, for over 20 years through pneumonia, a myocardial infa rction and ischemic colitis, as well as throug h the death of her husband and estrangement f rom her daughter. She views Dr. C as her doctor, supporter, counselor and friend. Over lunch, a friend mentions that Dr. C is leaving town f or an academic position. Arriving home alone, Mrs. N is anxious and upset. What will she do without Dr. C.? And, why didn't Dr. C have the courtesy to tell her himself ? Dr. C. and Mrs. N. shared a continuous relationship, coming to know each other as doctor andpatient and as persons. Continuity of relationship is a cornerstone of primary care, supporting benef its such as patient and clinician satisfaction, improved health outcomes and cost savings. An ongoing trusting relationship enables both clinicia n and patient to better confront f uture challenges. Today, the vagaries of insura nce plans and shifting provider \"networks\" make it increasingly difficult to maintain continuity in relationships. In the hospital, many patients are cared f or by hospitalist s whose work schedules interrupt continuity. Patients are more mobile than ever, and relationship continuity is further limited by f requent changes in insurance plan coverage. Patient dissatisfa ction with ca re disruptions may translate into patients requesting a new clinicia n, and clinicians, in exceptional circumsta nces, choosing to dismiss a patient. How do doctors and patients rea ct when the bond b etween them must be broken, and can we learn to predict, recognize and understand these reactions? In this Module we explore typical reactions to disruptions, terminations and transfers of care as well as communication strategies that have proven ef fective in managing such separations. AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) ATTACHMENT AND SEPARATION IN MEDICAL SETTINGS Biologic attachment drive creates strong bonds between people who care f or each other. When a clinician breaks bonds by leaving, pa tients commonly experience separation anxiety. B oth tenuous and over-\u00addependent relationships complica te sepa rations a nd provoke amplified requests for attention or alternatively, excessive independence and noncompliance. Case 1 (co ntinued): Mrs. N discovered a breast lump several weeks ago, and is unsure why she put off making an appointment-\u00ad-\u00adnow she wonders if she will be able to see Dr. C before he leaves. Her a nxiety g rows as she considers fa cing breast ca ncer without her trusted clinician. Bowlby described attachment theory, a framework f or understanding responses to disruptions of caring relationships a s, \"a way of conceptua lizing the propensities of huma n beings to ma ke strong affectionate bo nds to particular others and the many forms of emotiona l distress and disturbance to which unwilling separation and loss give rise. Attachment behaviors serve the biologic purpose of establishing relations of care and nurturance f or the very young, the frail and the ill. When these bonds are threatened or broken, separation anxiety is a common response. It peaks during the second a nd third years of li fe, but typica lly resurfaces during times of stress such as illness and hospitaliza tion. Mrs. N encountered f eelings of helplessness and dependency when she discovered a brea st ma ss and contemplated separating from D r. C. Case 2: Af ter learning that her clinicia n would be leaving town in several months, Ms. P, age 40, canceled her next appointment. In a letter she told her clinician that sa ying good-\u00adby e in person would be too diff icult. Most patients have trusting, open and secure relationships with their clinicians. Attachments are more tenuous f or some and usually reflect earlier relationship dif ficulties leading to either excessive independence and denial of interpersona l connections (\"I don't need you anyway\") or amplified requests for attention, care and nurture. For Ms. P, the supportive rela tionship with her clinician was a stark contrast to the abuse she suf fered as a child. The prospect of separation wa s, at least transiently, overwhelming and threatening. Terminat ion Syndro me Psychiatrists apprecia te that patients may respond to termination of the psychotherapeutic relationship with anger, sadness, anxiety, missed appointments a nd flares of psychiatric and/or somatic symptoms. This \"termination syndrome\" ha s also been observed in primary care. Case 3: Soon after her clinician moved to a nother city, Ms. V, a ge 54, repeatedly phoned the emergency number of her HMO requestin g urgent care for \"pneumonia.\" The on-\u00adca ll clinician obtained a history consistent with viral bronchitis and suspected that her symptoms were amplif ied by anxiety. Clinician: \"It sounds like you' re really worried about this cough.\" (Naming an emotion) Patient: \"I just don't know what to do. I need to talk with someone.\" Clinician: \"I notice f rom your chart that you were Dr. L's patient. He recently left the practice.\" Patient: \"I always counted on him to be there for me.\" Clinician: \"It sounds like you miss him and that makes this illness a lot more frightening.\" (Naming an emotion) Patient: \"Rig ht. Now I don't know wha t to do.\" Clinician: \"I can appreciate how difficult this is for you. I' m new to the practice and would be happy to take you on as a new patient. How does that sound to you?\" (Valida tion, or Legitimization) (Partnership)Patient: \"I'd be so you would. Thank you! \" The on-\u00adcall clinician correctly recognizes that Ms. V's anxiety is connected to the recent loss of her primary care clinicia n. Her symptoms and demands f or urgent care are amplified due to uncertainty a bout who would care for her. The clinician responds using basic empathy skills. (Module 6) Basic empat hic relat ion ship skills -\u00ad PEARLS: Partnership: \"We will work together in being certain we have identified a new clinician before I leave.\" Name the emo tion (Empat hy): \"I can see this news is pretty upsetting to you.\" Appreciat e / Respect the patient's feelings: \"You've been a great patient and I've enjoyed being your docto Legitimize the patient's respo nse: \"Af ter the many years that I've been your doctor, I apprecia te that my leaving raises many concerns f or you.\" Suppo rt: \"I'll be certain that we smoothly transf er your care to a caring and competeint clinician.\" Welco ming newly transferred pat ients Mrs V' s difficulties in case 3 remind clinicians to work at smoothing the transition to a new clinician by addressing the emotional a nd practical consequences of \"termination syndrome.\" When seeing a new patient, the alert clinician keeps in mind tha t patients may carry unresolved sadness, anger, or a nxiety stemming from the loss of their prior clinician and this may influence the patient's willingness to establish a trusting relationship with you. At the initial visit, ask how the patient feels about prior clinicians. S pecific questions include: \"What did you find particularly helpful or useful a bout your relationship with Dr. L?\" \"What do you miss about Dr. L?\" \"How have you done since Dr. L. left and were you prepa red for her/his leaving?\" \"What do you want our relationship to be like? This will be helpful for me to know as we begin our work tog ether. \" These questions are a novel starting point for negotia ting a new relationship tha t incorpora tes what the patient values f rom the previous one. Even a brief relationship-\u00adcentered inquiry communicates your interest in feelings and your openness to discussion of interpersonal matters. PATIEN T RESPONSES TO LOSS OF A PHYSICIAN Separation may precipitate anxiety, sa dness, anger or loss of self-\u00adesteem. Loss of one's clinician is particularly destabilizing f or patients with chronic illness, psychiatric disorders, social isola tion and f or those who have had a dependent or conflicted relationship with the clinician. Case 4: Soon after learning that his clinician, Dr. W. would be leaving, Mr. H. began calling the practice frequently f or medica tion renewals, to report new a nd \"worrisome\" symptoms, a nd to demand an immediate response from his doctor. Dr. W. was concerned that a flare of medically unexplained symptoms might indicate a missed diagnosis or perhaps a relapse of the patient' s substa nce abuse. . Dr. W. noticed that she was putting off returning Mr. H.'s calls. On top of the added ti me demands of closing her practice, Dr. W. became aware that emotion laden interchanges with patients wa s exhausting, particularly with dema nding and \"needy\" patients such as Mr. H. She even wondered if her practice style had promoted patient dependency. The frequent visits and shared experiences that accompany complex medical conditions build relationships and trust that a re not easily transf erred to another clinicia n. Vulnerable patients express their a nxiety, sadness and anger through a variety of behaviors. Like Mr. H, the wish to keep the clinician from leaving is expressed through the \"body language\" of physical symptoms and requests for care. Other common reactions include: Anger: Accusations that the clinician is irresponsible or uncaring. Sadness: Worsening of an underlying af fective disorder, withdrawal and low self-\u00adesteem (\"I'm not worth taking care of\"). Anxiety: Heightened somatic awa reness with misinterpretation of normal physiologic processes as symptoms of disease, and urgent requests f or care Gaining Control: \"Leaving before I' m left\" (Case 2 is an example). Denial of emotional response: (Case 5) Deterioration in a dherence to care plan and resumption of risky behaviors Minimize the impact of transfers Initiate discussion, tell patients sooner not later, raise the topic early in an encounter, listenattentively and legitimize the full range of potential negative emotions. Consider this discussion as similar to the delivery of \"bad news\" and use similar strategies. You must initiate discussion about an impending separation, even if reluctant to spend time this way. Acceptance of patients' responses in an empathic and nonjudgmental ma nner helps patients recognize, explore and resolve the loss. Incoming clinicia ns will be especially grateful, because such talks help patients avoid maladaptive behaviors that bedevil attempts to establish a new therapeutic relationship. Tell patients you are leaving sooner, not later. One approa ch is to inform patients as soon as your decision is certa in. Another is to tell patients no later than their next-\u00adto -the-\u00adlast visit. Vulnerable patients alwa ys benef it from earlier disclosure that a llows them time for emotional adjustment a nd logistic planning. Doctors, like patients, sometimes inadvertently leave important topics to the end of a visit. Make your leaving a specific agenda item and bring it up early in a visit so that you have time for dialog. The pitfa lls of ending a n encounter with, \"Oh, by the way, I'll be leaving the practice next month\" are obvious. Listen in a nonjudgmental and non-\u00addefensive manner, and legitimize (normalize) nega tive respon ses. Expressing \"negative\" emotions is easier for pa tients whose clinicia ns tell them that it is normal to feel anxious, angry, or abandoned when their doctor leaves. This legitimization invites patients to speak openly and often helps them resolve prior conf licts with the doctor and move forward with their care.Employ co mmunicat ion strategies similar to those used in breaking bad news. Begin with a brief, clear statement that you are leaving and when; do not elabora te initially. Allow a period of silence so patients can a ssimilate the news and respond. Elaborating, asking questions or providing reassurance at this time interrupts the intimacy created by sharing silence. Physical touch provides connection and helps the patient stay with her/his feelings. B ody language such a s slumped shoulders, downward gaze, or restless hands conveys patients' reactions more clearly than words. Patients' off-\u00adhand comments such as, \"Oh well, that' s the way things go for me,\" or a change of topic, are clues to their feelings. Invite them to elaborate on such responses. If the silence continues, a sk something like, \"I wonder wha t feelings or thoughts you are having in response to this news?\" Occasional pa tients will not wa nt to talk about termination, and your respecting this choice and patient s' boundaries is appropriate. You can reassure patients of your continued willingness to talk, that all emotional responses are acceptable and that you will help them plan for the future. Offer relationship building empathic statement (described above and in Modules 6 and 13) AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) PHYSICIAN RESPONSES TO TERMINATION Clinicians should mindfully attend to their own f eelings a bout saying good bye and cultivate awareness that both their medical decisions a nd their responses to patients are influenced by those f eelings. NOTE: move appdx 1, with a n intr o sentence, into this section...... The truism that \"doctors have feelings too\" is underscored when clinicians say good bye topatients. D egree of comfort with emotional a nd interpersonal issues, a ttachments to particula r patients and conf licts with others influence clinicia ns' responses. Sadness is to be expected but guilt, anger and relief are equally common (D r. W in Case 4.). Cool or noncommittal patient reactions can wound the clinicians' self-\u00adesteem, particularly for residents just establishing their professiona l identity. Increased cynicism is an unfortunate result that can be minimized through reflection and di scussion (Case 5. below). Reflection a nd personal awareness are key a ttributes that support clinician resilience a nd effectiveness during times of relationship stress (Module 2).Saying good-\u00adbye to a large number of patients is always daunting, and even more so if leaving the practice entails additional administrative burdens (Dr. W. in Case 4). Clinicia ns may intensif y their medical focus a nd worry that they missed diagnoses or neglected preventive measures. Adding this concern to the prospect of multiple emotiona l interchanges may provoke clinicia ns to procrastina te. Table1: Difficult Emo tional Responses to Terminat ion of the Do ctor-\u00adPatient Relat ionship PATIENT DOCTOR Sadness Sadness Anger Anger Separation Anxiety Guilt Feeling abandoned Relief Diminishing self esteem Emotional Fatigue Denial Denial Discomfort with a mbivalent/negative feelings Discomfort with a mbivalent/negative feelings Disillusionment with medical care and doctors Cynicism about lack of patient appreciation Uncertainty about future ca ere Embarrassment about patients' gifts Anxiety that important medical information will be lost in the transitionAnxiety about how medical care will be judged by incoming clinician Table 2: Behavio ral Respo the Docto r-\u00adPatient Relat ionship PATIENT DOCTOR Missed appointments Not returning calls Decrea sed adherence Failure to inform patients about leaving Increased somatic compla ints Hurried attempts to complete work-\u00adups Difficult bonding to new doctorAvoidance of emotional issues during interview Giving gifts Over/under involvement Boundary issues in transfer of care Patients may bring gifts of a ppreciation and may want to hug and kiss the doctor. As a rule, receive these signs of patient aff ection and gratitude with wa rm appreciation. A brief and gracious relaxa tion of the usual boundaries of the professional relationship is almost a lways appropriate. When sa ying good-\u00adbye to pa tients it is a ppropriate to express your own f eelings of sadness and to let patients know you will miss them. TIME-\u00adLIMITED SETTINGS Relationships a re predictably time limited in settings such as residency clinics, subspecialty consultative practices, inpatient coverage schedules for teaching attendings a nd for hospitalists. The practice setting strongly influences the emotional and behaviora l aspects of clinicians' departures. In many settings, short-\u00adlived relationships are the rule. Patients may quickly develop intense bonds with hospital-\u00adbased clinicians (hospita lists), sub sp ecialists and other personnel such as nurses and physical therapists. Hand-\u00adoff s of care at shift change are mini-\u00adterminations. Preparing patients for changes in clinician coverage. Responding empathically to patients' reactions improves relationships a nd probably enhances both quality of care and pa tient satisfaction. Resident co ntinuit y practices Residents in continuity clinics benef it from structur ed reflection on transf ers. In their own ways, many patients learn to anticipate the changes. Case 5: After a workshop on termina tions a nd transfers of care, a medicine resident scheduled to complete tra ining in 3 months tells a clinic patient that he will be leaving the practice soon. Afterwa rds, he meets with his clinic attending. Attending: \"S o, how did the sa id I was leaving a nd she just said, ' Oh, I expected tha t. Everyone knows that residents leave every three years.' She didn't seem bothered at all.\" Attending: \"How do you feel about her reaction?\" Resident: \"Well, it just shows that we residents are interchangeable. Patients seldom apprecia te all that we do f or them. I don' t think I' ve made much of an imp act.\" This resident' s response ca rries a tone of disillusionment and a tinge of cynicism, as is common in this situation. Workshops on departures and transfers of care provide opportunities f or residents to reflect on and learn from these and other responses. Residents and their patients frequently form meaningful a nd intense connections despite the limited duration of their relationship. However, most patients in resident clinics weather terminations without impairing their care, perhaps reflecting resident and clinic efforts to inform patients and insure smooth transfer of care. Quality improvement experts point out that pla nnedand purposeful communication during care transitions increases patient safety. Furthermore, patients who understand that clinicia ns change at least every three years may form a bond to the clinic rather than to the doctor, what Reider called \"institutional transf erence\".) However, some groups of patients have an increased risk of disruptions in care - including those with complex medical conditions, challenging psychosocial circumsta nces, non-\u00ada dherence and frequent in-\u00adpatient or ED visits. P ractice ba sed processes to prospectively identify patients at high risk and provide structured handof fs can reduce the number of patients lost to follow-\u00adup or who show up f or care in the emergency department or acute care clinic post handoff . Brief and intense relatio nships Clinicians and patients bond quickly when patients a re suddenly stricken, hospitalized or very concerned about their illness. In many settings, these intense bonds are soon broken and patients are \"left\" f requently, as specialists arrive and leave, at shift changes or while traveling. Office Practice: Case 6: Mr. R developed painful corneal erosions on a Friday af ternoon while at a remote conference center. Initially very concerned, he was pleased and reassured by the evaluation done by Dr. O, an ophthalmologist nearby. B efore leaving the office, Mr. R. asked what he should do if pain recurred or his vision worsened. Dr. O: \"My partner is on call this weekend. I' ll bring him down to meet you and take a look at your eye. That way you'll have already met ea ch other if a problem arises and he'll know what your eye looks like today. How does that sound?\" Mr. R: \"That's perfect. What a relief!\" Despite the brevity of their encounte r, Mr. R. and D r. O established a clinicia n-\u00adpatient relationship. Dr. O. recognized that to insure quality of care and to address Mr. R' s concern, it was important to introduce the patient to the clinician on call. Hospital Practice: Hospitalist clinicians often form intense yet time-\u00adlimited connections with their patients. At shif t changes, hand-\u00adof fs are mini-\u00adterminations as well as the medium f or information exchange. At a minimum, patients a ppreciate being informed prior to an upcoming change in attending clinician. Bedside hand-\u00adof fs have the advantage of providing an opportunity to say \"good-\u00adbye\" and introduce the new clinician. AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) POSITIVE POTENTIAL OF CARE TRANSFER Separation presents an opportunity to review importa nt events and savor the value an d meaning of the relationship. Physidian and patient may both acknowledge mutual af fection, respect and caring. Near the time of transfer, patient a nd doctor can review the \"ups and downs\" of their worktogether; and ta lk about times that have been challenging or diff icult as well as those that have been successful a nd rewarding. Issues of trust and feelings of abandonment warrant explicit discussion. The patient's personal strengths, contributions, resources, and socia l supports can be emphasized, and termination can stimulate valuable growth and enhance the pa tient's sense of self-\u00adef ficacy. The review often highlights personal and community resources for self-\u00admanagement, critical elements in th e management of chronic illness. Patients can a lso ref lect on what they value most in a doctor a nd consider these factors as they choose a new clinician. The opportunity f or review should not be missed or discounted. Despite social and institutional forces that conspire against spending time in \"reviewing relationships\", a few minutes spent on communication at a personal level improves serl-\u00adawareness , promotes persona l growth, builds community and broadens clinicians' abilities to ma nage complex, novel and unanticipated f uture relationships and situations. Choo sing to Dismiss Rarely and as a last resort clinicians may decide to dismiss a patient or a patient may request transfer to a new clinician. The behaviors and emotions that provoke these decisions can sometimes contribute to improving a relationship, or at times ca use irretrievable deteriora tion of the rela tionship. icult\", \"hateful\" or \"heart sink.\" Such labels typically arise in the following situations: repeated infringement of relationship boundaries, disruptive or threa tening beha viors, a degree of continuous non-\u00ada dherence that makes reasona ble management impossible and is a risk to self and a liability to others, or strongly negative emotional responses that clinicians think will significa ntly cloud professional judgment. In the past, patients who repeatedly presented medically unexpla ined symptoms(MUS) were often labeled in this nega tive fashion. With improved understanding of somatoform disorders, a nd formulation and descriptions of effective communica tion and treatement strategies, this problem is diminishing. (Module 31) Management problems related to prescription of opiod medications f or chronic pain a re worsening, and too many relationship problems now result in dismissal of patients with chronic pain problems. (see below). A written policy on patient dismissal helps ensure that each situation is ha ndled with strict adherence to medical, legal and ethical guidelines. Chro nic pain Clinician and patient unc ertainty and concerns about management of pain with opioid medications interfere with maintenance of mutual trust and respect.. Prescriptions f or opioid analgesics are a frequent cause of breakdown and termination of theclinician-\u00adpatient relationship. Difficulties often center on a patient's view that the clinicia n is unfairly withholding pain relief while the clinician views the suffering and needy patient as drug seeking and manipulative. The relationship dynamics a re worsened because indeed some patients skillfully pla y the suff ering and needy role as part of their substance abuse problem. (Module 30) Case 8, Patient view: Ms. B frequently visited her PCP complaining of severe and unrelenting back pa in. Despite non-\u00addiagnostic imaging studies, Ms. B insisted that her pain was \"real\" and required escalating dosages of opioid a nalgesia which her clinicia n declined to prescribe. She felt her clinicia n underestimated her suffering, did not understand the importance of pain relief in allowing her to continue working as a potter and increasingly viewed him as cold a nd unfeeling. After several f rustrating months sh e contacted the clinic director requesting a new PCP. Clinician view: Dr. M. came to dread seeing Ms. B . because her visits were dominated by demands for opioid analg esia. Although he cared deeply for Ms. B 's well being he was increasing ly convinced tha t she was abusing pain medications and mig ht even be obtaining narcotics \"on the street\" which she vehemently denied. Dr. M asked the clinic director to assign Ms. B another PCP. Suggestio ns fo r practice: The relationship breakdown between Ms. B and D r. M might have been prevented by establishing a formal treatment agreement prior to starting a regimen of chronic opioid therapy. An opioid agreement delinea tes patient and clinicia n responsibilities for the conduct of treatment and specifies consequences if these responsibilities a re not met. The eff icacy of treatment agreements (often labeled opioid or narcotic \"contracts,\" although they lack the legal status of a formal contract) has not been established, but clinical experience suggests they set a tone of shared decision making, and def ine bounda ries that help sustain respect and trust (see Module 30 video, \"narcotic contract,\" and \"resistant patients\"). Clinicians may decline requests to presc ribe opioids, but continue to off er alternate approaches to pain management that will improve function, and continue to care for a patient's other medical problems. \"I apprecia te that you are in pain and I am committed to providing you the best and safest medical care. In my opinion, opioid a nalgesics a re not (or are no longer) an appropriate management approach to your pain and I do not plan on pre scribing them. I know this is disappointing news for you and ma y not be what you hoped for. If you would like, I will refer you to a pain specialist for another opinion on management. I also wa nt you to know that I am willing to continue to be your PCP a nd work with you on your other health issues. \" Reco ncile or dismiss? Establish practice guidelines for dismissal; make rela tionship deteriora tion a n explicit discussion topic, and consider the pros and cons of reconciliation versus dismissal. Patients sometimes dismiss a clinician, a s well. When a relationship is deteriorating clinicia ns should initiate conversations about the decline and adhere to principles outlined in prior modules regarding difficult conversations. Reconciliation can result in a strengthened partnership, whereas dismissal of a patient leaves a bad taste for both parties - and often for other staff as well. To begin,respectf ully describe the behaviors that cause serious concern and ask f or the patient's point of view. Elicit the patient's goals and values, and do not focus on entrenched positions -maintain a nonjudgmental stance. Avoid arguments, counter-\u00ad attacks and def ensiveness. As in all relationships, negotiation is more likely to succeed if the clinician raises concerns before they reach the \"difficult\", \"hateful\" or \"heart sink\" level ofintolerability. Clinicians should write and honor practice-\u00adspecific guidelines for dismissing patients, and review them prior to taking a ction. Initially it is prudent and helpful to review concerns and decisions with trusted colleagues, and to enlist support from practice managers, risk management, patient advoca tes and/or a patient relations off ice. Depending on the setting, the intensity of the conflict and the participants' tolera nce for negotiation, the benef its of a fresh start with a new clinicia n may outweigh those of continued attempts at reconciliation. Outright threats to the clinicia n or the practice are particula rly intolerable. The personal challenge of skillfully responding to the strong emotions engendered is addressed in other modules. Dismissal may also be init iated by a patient who is dissat isfied wit h care and requests a new do ctor. Frequently cited reasons f or dismissing clinicia ns are behavior that is dehumanizing, rude, uncaring, impersonal, unresponsive, incompetent, dishonest, or belligerent. A patient's request for transfer presents an opportunity to reassess goals, values and boundaries and potentially discover mutually accepta ble approaches to better communica tion, better relationship and better ca re. DEATH OF A PATIENT Death is a special instance of leave taking, and an opportunity to extend compassion to the family; a meaningful letter of condolence may produce importa nt benef its for the bereaved. Death of a patient means saying good-\u00adbye to the patient and in ma ny cases acknowledging and responding to bonds with the pa tient's family. Attending the pa tient's funera l or visitation acknowledges the patient's value and is an opportunity to grieve the loss. Sharing f eelings a nd memories with the fa mily or colleagues f acilitates the mourning process and comf orts both fa mily and clinician. Case 7: Mr. E, 33, died on a genera l medicine unit from complications of chronic hemodialysis. The attending clinician wrote to the family expressing his condolences and availability. Several weeks later the patient's sister requested an appointment and described overwhelming grief and guilt since her brother's death. \"If only I had donated my kidney he would still be alive.\" After responding to her grief, the clinician reminded her that her brother was not deemed an acceptable tra nsplant ca ndidate. He scheduled a meeting with the nephrologist, who a nswered her questions and further relieved her guilt A letter of condolence communicates personal involvement, human connection and availability. It extends compassion to the patient's f amily. If there is no communication, f amilies may wonder, \"Where did the doctors go?\" In case 7, the clinician' s extension of caring and availability provided relief, and may have prevented an extended bereavement response or depression. Bereaved survivors, especia lly a spouse, suffer increased morbidity and mortality after a loss. Increased attention to the emotional, social and medical needs of the bereaved ma y mitigate the risk. Practice suggest ions fo r a Lett er of Condolence Acknowledge the loss and name the deceased Express your sympathy Note special qualities of the deceased Recall a memory a bout the deceasedRemind the bereaved of their personal strengths Offer help End with a word or phrase of sympathy DEPARTURE FROM PRACTICE: ETHICS Planning for terminations and transfers includes meeting specif ic ethical obliga tions a nd a careful review of a clinician's patient pa nel to identify patients especially vulnerable to disruptions in care. Departures from or closing a medical practice increase the workload and are emotional and stressful times f or practitioners, staff , patients, and others. If mishandled, terminations can signif icantly disrupt continuity of care as well as office routines and eff iciency. Clinicians should facilitate teamwork with pra ctice mana gers, nursing and support staff that will allow everyone to contribute to smoother transitions. Forethought and planning prevents discontinuity and disruption and improves patient satisfaction. Clinicians who leave a practice must attend to the following ethical obliga tions: Inform patients of major changes (such as the clinician leaving the practice). Notify patients suf ficiently in advance (at least 30 days) to secure other medical care. Inform patients how to contact the departing practitioner. Facilitate patients' ability to choose a practitioner from among those in the practice or outside, within existing constraints. Tell patients how to obtain copies of or transfer of their medical records. In settings such a s resident clinics where turnover is predicable, patients should be informed early that their clinicia n will leave when training is finished. Planning for terminations and transfers includes meeting specif ic ethical obliga tions a nd a careful review of a clinician's patient panel to identify patients especia lly vulnera ble to disruptions in care. Patients requiring special attention and planning for social, psychological or medical reasons should be identified early. Advance planning is necessary for patients with complex illness and chronic disea ses. Vulnerable patients should be contacted and encouraged to schedule an appointment prior to the clinician' s leaving. Give special considera tion in choosing a new clinician for patients with limited English language skills or other cultural pref erences. Patients without a scheduled appointment and not a t specia l risk for separation problems can be informed of the practitioner' s leaving by phone ca ll or letter. (Appendix). The letter should f ulfill the obligations listed above. Office personnel can provide a sense of continuity in clinics where clinicia n turn over is high. In resident clinics, attending clinicians can help smooth transitions in ca re. Provide the patient with (or direct them to) information regarding transfer of medica l records and other logistic matters. A patient's new clinicia n should be identified by name and introduced to the patient, when possible. A personal meeting of outgoing and new clinicians allows the sharing of information, especially about interpersona l issues or others that might result from the transfer of care that even the best tra nsfer note ca nnot a dequately convey. APPENDIX Dear Mr./Ms. Patient: I will be leaving the ___name of pra ctice__ on ____date___. Thus, I will no longer be able toserve as your clinician. I am writing because I want you to be awa re that I am leaving and to allow enough time f or you to make an a ppointment with me, if you wish, before I leave. My colleagues at __name of practice__ have a greed to take on your care. Each one is a dedicated and caring clinician. Some patients have a lready made plans to see one of my colleagues. If you have not done so, you should call a nd make an appointment with a new doctor. When you call, our off ice staff will tell you whether the clinician you prefer is ava ilable. I know you will receive excellent care. If you wish to transfer your ca re to another practice, our office can provide a list of clinicians and you should sign a release f or your medical records. I also want to take this opportunity to tell you something about myself and the reasons I will be leaving the practice. (insert message) I will miss you and will carry you in my heart.

What aspects of your own ora l case presenta tions would you like to improve? Key Principles: 1. Using a standard format can guide novice and advanced lea rners in organizing essential information for oral ca se presentations 2. Determining and adjusting to the expectations of your audience and setting can guide learners in tailoring ora l case presenta tions 3. Attending to your presentation style (e.g., appearance, demeanor, and verbal a nd nonverbal signals) can enhance the quality of oral ca se presentation 4. Advancing students use clinical reasoning to prioritize and organize oral presentation content 5. Practicing your oral ca se presentation can enhance fluency, confidence and competence 6. Asking for feedback on oral ca se presentations can support skill development Learning go als: At the co nclusion o f this mo dule, yo u will be able to : Value learning and mastering the skills required to organize and deliver effective oral presenta tions List key principles f or constructing eff ective oral ca se presentations, and list common problems that interfere with ef fectiveness Use the STAGE framework to tailor oral ca se presentations so that they meet clinical and educa tional goa ls Apprecia tively ask for, receive and deliver feedba ck about your own and colleagues' skills at making oral presentations INTRODUCTION Oral case presenta tion is a distinct clinical skill, a nd this module provides engaging tools and a cognitive framework (STAGE) to assist with learning and improving this skill. STAGE is a mnemonic for a f ramework that guides learners in developing their oral ca se presenta tion skills, and also guides f aculty in providing feedback to learners. Teachers and learners can utilize the STAGE f ramework to review key elements of ora l case presenta tions, to model or practice delivering them and to give or request f eedback on presentations. Check o ut the video example where Dr. Monroe describes the goals of this module. This module advoca tes for augmenting instruction in oral case presentation, and reviews key concepts and the STAGE f ramework, through text, video a nd exercises. OVERVIEW Advancing students master the primary components of oral ca se presentation: structure/content and style of delivery. Students who master the novice level c an extract key information from the patient's na rrative, organize information chronologically, and use a structured presenta tion style. Ef fective novices are able connect the f acts into a chronological, relevant and condensed medical narrative. More advanced learners understand wha t listeners typically need in order to engage quickly withunique f eatures of a case, to ra pidly understand the clinical issues and to construct a differential diagnosis. The advanced presenter uses this understa nding to filter, sort and organize the data so as to deliver a succinct, organized, compelling and engaging presenta tion. As an advocate f or the highest qua lity of care for the patient, the presenter wishes to provide listeners with essential facts so as to achieve the best possible outcome. The advoca te's central task is to organize data from severa l domains, including a) the patient' s current symptoms and story, b) relevant psychosocial and behaviora l factors, c) importa nt physical findings, d) and relevant laboratory , radiology and other data. Advanced presenters balance the need for thoroughness against the helpfulness of succinctness, and omit details that might be interesting, but not relevant to the patient's central issues. Similarities a nd differences between writ ten and o ral presentatio ns While both types of presentations document the relevant data to support dia gnosis and treatment, there a re important diff erences. The written writeup is comprehensive while the oral presentation is focused and concise. Written and oral presentations each thoughtfully organize the patient' s narrative into a coherent and sequential HPI a nd utilize t he same format and information. The information includes subjective da ta elicited from the patient, f amily and records, and objective data from physical exam, laboratory and radiology. The written record is more expansive about narrative details and symptoms, and also more thoroughly describes past problems, potential f uture problems, psychosocial details, review of systems a nd comprehensive physical and laboratory exams. Basic principles fo r oral case present ations The oral case presentation is a brief edited presentation of the essential information using a standard approach. However, it is not uniform, and its content depends on audience, setting and goals. Use notes a nd practice at first, so as to develop proficiency and eff iciency in this aspect of clinica l care and clinical educa tion. Not only do oral presentations diff er from written, but the length and amount of deta il are influenced by the audience and setting (medicine attending rounds, a surgery consult request, obstetrics and gynecology walk rounds, pediatrics evening sign out), and the goals of the oral presenta tion (teaching, patient care and/or evaluation of clinica l skills). A full medicine presenta tion in attending rounds sh ould be under 5 minutes. A presentation in the hallway on walk rounds on surgery should take no more than 1-\u00ad3 minutes. Students are often uncertain what is expected, and so should check with supervisors to clarify expectations. Check o ut the video example about the importa nce of practiceStudents' initial oral presentations should be written, practiced and then delivered with minimal dependence on written notes. Advanced students will be suff iciently familia r with varied f ormats and suff iciently engaged with the details a nd management of their patients that they will eventually not need notes to organize and concisely present appropriate essentia l details. Standard fo rmat fo r the oral case presentatio ns Novice medical students focus on the seven basic components of the standard case presenta tion, which f orm the STORY of the presenta tion. Advanced students add an eighth component, the Plan for the primary problem plus an Assessment and Plan for additional active problems. As your basic science, physical exam skills and clinical problem-\u00adsolving skills increase, the requirements of your oral case presentations will also grow. You will expand the formula tion section of the case presentation to include the differential diagnosis and a plan for evaluation and treatment. Check o ut the video example about format and content expectations for novice and advanced lea rners 1. The Opening Statement (Identifying informa tion/chief complaint ID/CC) 2. The History of Present Illness (HPI) including relevant information f rom Review of Systems (ROS\u2014these include symptoms related to the major and adjacent organ systems, constitutiona l complaints such as fever and weight loss and epidemiological risk factors or exposures) 3. Other active medical problems 4. Selected Elements of Past Medical History Selected Hospita lizations/surgeries (relevant to HPI) Medications/OTC/Herba l remedies Allergies (reaction) 5. Brief Social History (current situation a nd major issues only and tobacco, alcohol and substance use) 6. Physical exam (pertinent findings only) 7. Formulation/Summary statement of the prima ry problem (includes diff erential dia gnosis) 8. Plan for primary problem and Assessment/Plan for each additional active problem (for advanced level) Advanced presenters use clinical rea soning to guide the structure and content of oral case presenta tion, organizing and prioritizing information based on what you think are the patient's most likely diagnoses. STAGE FRAMEWORK FOR DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE ORAL CASE PRESENTATIONS STAGE is a structure that incorporates the standa rd format for oral ca se presentations with tips for guiding you in crea ting and tailoring your oral ca se presentations. The elements of STAGE include: Story/Style, Timing, Audience, Goals, a nd Eliciting Feedback Check o ut the video example where Dr. Monroe names and describes the elements of ora l case presenta tions. The sections below provide additional a nnotations a nd guidance f or creating and tailoring oral case presenta tions. STORY The first element includes both the Story and Style. The Story conta ins the standard seven or eight components listed below. 1. Opening Statement (Identifying Information/Pertinent Illnesses/Chief Complaint) 2. History of Present Illness (HPI) 3. Other Active Medical Problems 4. Past Medical History (PMH) 5. Social History 6. Physical Exam 7. Formulation/Summary statement of the primary problem 8. Plan for primary problem and Assessment/Plan f or each additional active problem (for advanced level) Opening Statement (Ident ifying Informatio n/Pertinent Illnesses/Chief Co mplaint) This element is the Story headline and engages the listener, states the presenting problem, and introduces the pa tient as a person. The identifying information includes the patient' s name, a ge and -\u00adsex (gender is a social construct that relates t o how one defines one's role and identity in society, sex connotes biology only and is the preferred term\u2014this expla nation is not for inclusion in the paper), a nd the presenting compla int in his/her own words, with the apparent duration of the compla int. At times it states other past or active medical problems relevant to the main problem-and if so, lists them only by diagnosis, as the \"HPI\" or \"other medical problems\" elements provide more details. Ask for help in deciding whether to state other active problems when this is not obvious.Do not include race or ethnicity unless it helps listeners weigh dia gnostic possibilities dif ferently. Avoid editorial comments and distracting information\u2014in particular, do not give any detail about other medical problems. Check o ut the video example about content of opening statement including CC Cont rasting Examples: (Providing editorial comment and too much detail): Mr. Jones is a difficult but unfortunate 35 year old man with a complica ted social history, his active problems include diabetes mellitus complicated by retinopathy and nephropathy, COPD with FEV1 of 1.5 liters, coronary artery disease with EF 50%, who pres ents with a chief complaint of abdominal pain for 3 days after going on a drinking binge. (Improved): Mr. Jones is a 35 year old who presents with abdominal pain for 3 days f ollowing one week of heavy drinking. His active problems include diabetes mellitus, COPD and CAD . Listeners will be distracted by the interesting comments a nd details in the initial example. The improved example does not interrupt listeners train of thought between the chief complaint and the history of present illness. Relevant information about the problems might be stated in the \"HPI\" or \"other medical problems.\" Additio nal Go od Examples: Mr. Mason is a 47 year-\u00adold man with a 10 year history of diabetes mellitus who presents with a chief complaint of nausea and vomiting f or 3 days. Mrs. Hernandez is a 50 year-\u00adold woma n who was electively admitted for evaluation of increasing shortness of breath over 5 days. Her active problems include sarcoidosis and hypertension. Mr. Jones is a 22 year old man who comes to the clinic for follow-\u00adup of daily headaches. History of Present Illness (HPI) The HPI element begins with a general statement of the patient's health prior to onset of the current illness then tells a chronological story that includes details about the importa nt symptoms. Begin the HPI with an introductory statement of prior health/f unction, a nd follow this with a chronologica l reporting of the illness story. This introductory sentence typically f ollows the following f ormat: Mr./Mrs./Ms.____ was in his/her usual state of (excellent health/poor health) until (three days/weeks) prior to admission when she (suddenly/gra dually) developed (pain/fever/wheezing ).State times relative to admission (e.g., 3 days prior to admission), instead of reporting that an event occurred \"on Sa turda y\". Check o ut the video example where Dr. Monroe demonstrates HPI Good Examples: Mr. B oone has a long history of chronic obstructive lung disease a nd home oxygen therapy. He was in his usual state of health until three days prior to admission, when he developed gradual worsening of his shortness of breath, associated with a cough productive of yellow sputum and a fever of 102. Mr. Ryan has a long history of coronary artery disease including three myocardial infarctions, the most recent in 2004, a nd congestive heart f ailure. He was in his usual state of health, with angina occurring once per week, until the night of admission when, while watching a f ootba ll game on television, he suddenly developed severe substernal chest heaviness. In the HPI, chara cterize the major presenting symptoms, state wha t the patient thinks is causing the symptoms (his attribution), and mention any prior episodes, complications and the relevant Review of Systems (ROS) questions (include both pertinent positives and negatives). If there wa s any evaluation of the chief compla int prior to hospital admission, include this also. A usef ul memory a id to help characterize symptoms Asso features\u2014Timing including constancy, duration, frequency, changes over time (progressive, stable or improving); previous similar episodes; + what else happened-\u00ad for example, if the major symptom is wheezing, describe associated cough, pain, f ever, ra sh, and so on.. Give relevant Past Medical History, Social History, Family History contributing to HPI. The positives and negatives f rom Review of Systems a re usually pertinent to the differential diagnosis. Cont rasting HPI examples: (poorly cha racterized and too brief) ...admitted for evaluation of chest pain. He was well until three weeks prior to admission when he began to feel chest heaviness whenever he exerted himself . He saw his local doctor who prescribed antacids with little benef it. The pain woke him last night so he came into the emergency room for evaluation. His other problems include....... (symptoms characterized and relevant past history, f amily history, ROS and other details added) ...admitted for evaluation of chest pain. He was in his usual state of good health until one week prior to admission when he developed the gradual onset of intermittent chest pain, chara cterized as substernal heaviness which radiated to his jaw and left arm, lasting about f ive minutes per episode, occurring several times a day, a ggravated by exertion and relieved by rest. Associated with the pain were shortness of breath and sweating, but no nausea. One week prior to admission he was seen by a local doctor who, without other testing, dia gnosedgastritis a nd prescribed antacids without benefit. The chest pain was stable until two hours prior to admission, when the patient awoke with a more severe version of the same pain tha t lasted until he came to the emergency room. He was quickly transferred to the coronary care unit. There was no history of cough, heartburn, weight loss, f ever, or chills. The patient has a positive family history coronary artery disease, a cholesterol of 310 in 1998, and has never smoked cigarettes. Other Active Medical Problems Learning which problems to state in an oral presentation, learning the \"key words\" that apply to describing dif ferent illnesses, and learning what is \"irrelevant\" f or a particular oral presenta tion is complex, and must be learned in the context of a ctive participation with more experienced clinicians. Other active problems include the same problems mentioned in \"Opening statement\". For example, diabetes mellitus is relevant f or a patient admitted with angina. Consider each condition separately and recount details chronologically; for example, first expla in the history of coronary disease, telling the story from the beginning to the present, then discuss his peptic ulcer, and then his COPD . Present information on a series of problems in order of importance, with most important first. ...his other medical problems include insulin-\u00adrequiring diabetes f or 12 years and complica ted by retinopathy, painful polyneuropathy, and nephropathy. His recent creatinine was 1.7..... Use \"key words\" and phrases to summarize an ongoing chronic illness in this section. In general, key words emphasize date of diagnosis, its treatment, current symptoms, complications, and recent objective tests. Approp riate \"key words\" vary with the nature of the problem, and you learn these with clinical experience and by listening to more experienced clinicians make oral presenta tions. ....history of multiple abdominal procedures including appendectomy, cholecystectomy and hysterectomy, and insulin dependa nt diabetes with target organ dysfunction.... ....long history of chro nic o bstructive lung disease with steroid dependence and the requirement f or home oxygen therapy, a 1994 FEV1 of 0.8L, and three hospital admissions for exacerbations in the last year. He has never been intubated... ...two yea r history of congestive heart failure, felt to be secondary to alcohol cardiomyopathy, characterized by chronic one block dyspnea on exertion, three pillow orthopnea, and ankle edema . In addition to his long term therapy with fur osemide and enalapril, digoxin was added six months ago. An echocardiogram f our months prior to admission showed four cha mber enlargement and global hypokinesis with ejection fraction of presenta tion of \"irrelevant\" diagnoses. Like \"key words\" what is \"irrelevant\" is seldom obvious to novices. For example, \"syphilis in 1940, malaria in 1952, catara ct extraction in 1972, and cholecystectomy i n 1987\" are usually irrelevant during presenta tion of the patient with diabetes and crescendo angina. Past Medical Histo ry (PMH) Include all of the patient's problems in your write-\u00adup, but refrain from orally presentingproblems not relevant to the current active problems. Select which hospitalizations and surgeries to include. List a ll prescribed medications (have information on dosages ava ilable), and any releva nt non-\u00adprescription medica tions a nd herbal medications. Of course, you will only be able to give as much detail about medications as the patient can give you, unless you have the patient's chart or off ice medication list. Report a ny drug allergies and the type of reaction (f or exa mple, \"...developed a rash af ter receiving penicillin 20 years ago and carries the dia gnosis of penicillin allergy\"). Social Histo ry (current situat ion and majo r issues) Every person has a complex social history; summarize it in a brief paragraph (2-\u00ad3 sentences). The social history often expla ins why the patient has fallen ill or decided to seek care now. For example, patients may lack social support and the help needed to follow pla ns, few financial resources to buy medications, or depression that reta rds their taking action. If unaddressed, these factors lead to hospitalizations. Comment on current lif e situation including habits, work, living environment, and support systems, and important stressors. Include information about advance directives (living will and durable power o f attorney) and any discussion with you about these issues. Summarize substance use, but if mentioned in the HPI, do not repeat it. Include tobacco, alcohol and other drugs (including a buse of prescribed drugs). State amounts, f requency, a nd duration; and include intravenous use, past or present. Relevant information regarding Family History and Review of Systems has usually been incorporated into othe r elements of the Story. Physical Examination Report of physica l examination findings always includes a general description, vital signs and both positive and negative f indings pertinent to the admitting problem and active disea ses. Check o ut the video example where Dr. Monroe demonstrates report of PE This aspect of ora l presentations includes severa l elements. B egin with a general description - paint a word picture so listeners can visualize the patient. \"The patient was sitting on the edge of the bed, leaning f orward and gasping f or brea th\" is better than \"the patient was short of breath.\" Always state the vita l signs, and ment ion relevant postural changes in blood pressure and pulse.After the word picture and the vital signs, limit presentation to relevant positive findings a nd relevant negative findings. An exa mple of 'negative findings\" in the dyspneic patient would be that \"the exam is remarkable f or clear lungs bilaterally.\" Use concise but complete descriptions of positive findings. Formulat ion/Summary statement o f the primary problem (includes differential diagnosis) The formulation synthesizes pertinent da ta into a problem title from which the differential diagnosis is derived. This synthesis takes the following f orm: \"...the patient's presenting problem is wheezing/a bdominal pain/urethra l discharge. Then state \"The differential diagnosis includes a/b/c. The diagnosis of c appears to be most likely beca use of x, y, and z.\" .....the patient's main problem is a crescendo pattern of exertional chest pain, now prolonged at rest, which could be due to a myocardia l infarcti on, a dissecting aortic aneurysm, pericarditis, and other diagnoses such as pneumonia, pulmona ry embolus, or esophageal disease. MI seems most likely, because his description of chest pain is classic for angina and because his ECG reveals a new injury current in the inferior leads. Plan for primary pro blem and Assessment/Plan fo r each additio nal active problem (fo r advanced level) As you advance, your presenta tion will include specific plans f or confirming a diagnosis, instituting treatment for it and monitoring the progress of the illness. For each a ctive problem, you will present an assessment, including differential diagnosis (if diagnosis not known) and plan. .....to diagnose the MI, I recommend a cardiac enzyme panel and repeat ECG in the morning. We have ordered ASA , B-\u00adblocker, ACEI, a statin a nd consulted cardiology for consideration of angiography and intervention. The patient is on continuous ECG monitor and frequent vitals. In addition, the uncomplicated diabetes is well controlled on insulin. The hypokalemia is probably due to chronic use of diuretics but may be induced by the stress of this acute illness. Replacement potassium ha s been ordered along with a repeat blood test.... STYLE St yle, which includes appearance, demeanor and nonverbal signals, strongly impacts the quality of your oral case presenta tion. Modulate your voice and cadence of your presenta tion. Every patient is unique; capture the specia l elements so a s to engage the listeners. Paint a word picture of the patient. Stand up straight and make eye contact so as to connect with listeners. Do not bury your nose in the chart; and do not read verbatim your presenta tion. Become enthusiastic about this patient, and show your engagement with the situa tion. Rehearse and know the situa tion well enough to feel confident and show it. In the case of inadequate time for preparation, say so, only once, a nd be confident about wha t you do know. \"Sweating bullets\" severely limits your learning and that of others. Avoid distra cting \"Um's/Ah's\" during your presentation-\u00ad silent pauses are always preferable to \"um's\" No one likes to listen to repeated nonsense syllables or fillers, such as, \"ok\", \"maybe\", or \"the pa tient said that....\" Eliminate verbal \"tics\" f rom your repertoire. Learn f rom colleagues, attend to presenters who engage you and make the exercises fun, then imitate them. Think of a sport, or a jazz ensemble. TIMING Timing is influenced by expectations specif ic to the setting of your oral case presenta tion. Specif ic courses, clinica l settings, and supervising residents or attendings impose differing expectations for the duration of a presentation. Ask supervisors and instructors about their expectations and preferences for length, conciseness, a nd when they pref er summary versus details. Observe your colleagues. Mostly people want to help learners. Complex medical issues, busy clinica l services and other demands on your instructors may require your attentiveness and may influence the timing of your presenta tion. AUDIENCE/SETTING Presentations typically occur in the conference room, hallway or bedside. Each audience and location requires adjustments to your presentation. Check o ut the video example about seeking clarification of audience/setting Bedside presentations require attention to the patient and family and usually include a n invitation to them to add to or edit the informa tion in your presentation. While bedside presenta tions may seem difficult or a wkward, studies confirm strong patient preference for them and, with practice, growing learner preference, too. Fo llowing a bedside presentation, it is important for you to check with the patient in order to clarif y or resolve any questions related to your presentation. Make additional adjustments related to special audiences (grand rounds versus daily work rounds), to the degree of privacy available, and to how well listeners already know the patient. GOALS The specific goa ls of a presentation determine the details of content, length, and organization. Common situa tions that call f or important alterations in oral presentation include arranging cross coverage, inf orming the tea m of new admissions, and f ormative or summative evaluation of learner skills. Consider whether the goa l is to promote patient safety and high quality patient care, to promote gro up learning, or to perform for an evaluation of your knowledge and skill.. Elicit Feedback Feedback on presentations enables you to obtain inf ormation from different observers, utilize ideas derived from multiple perspectives, make targeted a djustments, and check on whether you are advancing your skills. Check o ut the video where D r. Monroe reinf orces reasons for eliciting feedback Feedback provides important informa tion about how to adapt your approach in the future. More feedback is better than less, and immediate f eedback is pref erable to feedback tha t is delayed. The following strategies can a ssist in structuring and organizing f eedback. Self-\u00adassess each component of your presentation in light of the STAGE f ramework. In advance of a presentation, establish your colleagues' (and faculty) expecta tions a bout the Story, Timing, Audience a djustments, and Goals. Share your self-\u00ada ssessment (strengths and opportunities for improvement) and request feedback on the accura cy of your self-\u00adassessment. From both junior and senior colleagues, solicit f eedback and suggestions about a specif ic component of the STAGE f ramework. Develop a plan for improvement and specif y a time to follow-\u00adup with fa culty regarding your progress. Asking fo r feedback Greeting: \"Hi, how is the day going for you? Is this a good time f or you to give me some feedback on my oral case presentations?\" Share your self-\u00ada ssessment of your presentation: \"I think I have a handle on how toconstruct a n opening statement and chronologica lly convey key information in the history of present illness, but I am unclear on whether I am including all the appropriate pertinent positives and negatives. \" Solicit observations a nd suggestions, in advance: \"Would you be able to comment on the appropriateness of my inclusion and exclusion of components of the past medical history, social history, and fa mily history in the present illness?\" Solicit observations a nd suggestions, afterwards: \"What went well from your perspective? Could you give me some suggestions on how to improve?\" Make a plan f or follow-\u00adup: \"Would you be able to listen to a presentation in a week to comment on my progress?\" Express appreciation: \"Thanks, that was especially helpful because.....\" Exercise #1: 47 YEAR OLD MAN WITH CHEST PAIN Part A: The interview Observe t his brief int erview (4:41) o f a a standardized patient wit h chest pain by a third year student.

COMMON MISTAKES IN ORAL PRESENTATION Improving presenta tion skill requires a disciplined and systematic approa ch that includes improving knowledge about what an excellent presentation looks and sounds like, and practicing with peers and fa culty to aid you in identifying and trouble shooting problems. Common problems fall into two broad cat egories: first, information\u2014failing to summarize, organize and transmit coherently huge amounts of information (this requires learning a new jargon); a nd second, \"delivery\"-\u00ad-\u00ad f ailing to maintain connection and relationship with listeners. 1. Labo red rhythm, wit h litt le audience co ntact -\u00ad novice students typically have difficulty tracking all the informa tion and tend to present in a wandering, disorganized and/or desultory f ashion. Maintaining eye contact with your listeners means that you should not read your write-\u00adup verbatim, and instead use notes. The skill to convert a written history and physical examination into a compressed pres entation requires practice, like any other skill. At first, take the time to practice it two or three times in advance. For most learners, it ishelpful to find a classmate or resident who can spend a few minutes listening, give you feedback and watch you try again. Most learners also benefit from a udio-\u00adtaping (or video-\u00ad taping) in order to gain personal insights. Like any skill, this one is easier for some students than others; so some advanced students may need to continue practicing. 2. History of present illness to o brief -\u00ad 90% of correct diagnoses come f rom the history alone; so do not sabotage your listener's understanding of the case by omitting important information. The HPI portion of the oral presenta tion, as a general rule, should take 1/3 to 1/2 of the presentation time. Common pitfalls include incomplete chara cterization of major symptoms, reporting lists of symptoms instead of a chronologica l story, omitting pertinent negatives or positive ROS questions, and omitting specif ic information a bout pa st history that relates to the present problem. 3. Failure to use parallel reference point s -\u00ad in both write-\u00adups and oral presentations, relate time in \"hours/days/weeks prior to admission\". Avoid \"at 2:00 in the morning of last Wednesday\" or \"on May 25th\"; instea d, say \"three hours prior to admission\", or \"at 2:00 am, three days prior to admission\". 4. Edito rializing -\u00ad a void comments like \"do you even wa nt to hear this?...\" or \"cardiac examination revea led a systolic murmur....well, I thought heard it, but the resident didn't...so maybe it isn't there....I don' t really know....\" 5. Use o f negative statements instead of positive statements. Positive statements add color and accuracy to your presentation. \"Chest X-\u00adra y shows normal heart size\" is better than \"chest X-\u00adray shows no cardiomegaly\". \"In summary, this patient's problem is acute dyspnea\" is better than \"the patient's problem is rule-\u00adout pneumonia\". 6. Unnecessary and repetitio us descript ive sentences. Overly repetitious sentences become monotonous and lose the listeners. \"On pulmonary exam, the lungs were normal...on cardiac exam, the heart sounds were..., on lymph node exa m, there were no cervical nodes...\" is unnecessary - your listener knows that S1 and S2 are part of the cardiac exam! Use brief descriptive sentences: \"an S 3 gallop was heard a t the left lower sternal border.\" 7. Disorganizatio n - Every novice learner has this problem. B ecause students are f requently encountering new illnesses, new twists on extreme human conditions and new situations for presenta tion, be aware that disorganization can happen even with careful preparation. Rehearsal, feedback, experience with multiple types of problems and situa tions, and attending to the structure of presentations you hear and admire will ea ch help improve organization. If you sense that you are not on track, pause. D o not make editorial and self-\u00ad referential comments like \"Oh, I ca n't believe I forgot to tell you this! \" Saying \"...in summary, this patient...wait, I forgot to tell you the most important thing...\" will kill a presenta tion. Everyone forgets, and everyone has feelings of embarrassment too, so listeners will he lp you get all the data on the table, and help you reorga nize it, but they will be less charitable if you spend presentation time making a big deal about shortcomings a nd talking about yourself . Be certain that you have the opportunity to talk with your supervisors about the shortcomings and the associated feelings in feedback sessions. 8. Lack of pro per t erminolo gy fo r physical findings-\u00ad for example, \"lymph node exam shows some small cervical nodes\" is not as descriptive as \"...there were three soft tender mobile nodes in the left anterior cervical chain which measure 1 x 1 x 2 cm each... \" Commitment to a ccura cy will improve your physical examination skills. 9. Naming a diagnosis instead of describing physical findings-\u00ad dia gnoses belong in the assessment, descriptions in the physical examination. For exa mple, a void \"exam showed the apex and to the axilla\". Avoid \"skin exa m showed psoriatic lesions on the elbows...\"; and instead say \"there were severa l 2 cm. dia meter round plaques with silver scale distributed on the extensor surf ace of the elbows...\" CONCLUSION Competent oral presentations help listeners and presenters maintain a high standard of patient care by facilitating coherent information transfer that is essential to high quality clinica lreasoning about diagnosis, treatment, and teamwork. The STAGE f ramework can assist learners to organize information and to deliver it clearly in oral presenta tions, and STAGE provides a structure for practice a nd feedback.

Describe parallels between rela tionship-\u00adcentered communication processes in clinical and organizational settings. INTRODUCTION In caring f or patients, no person works alone. The quality of teamwork and communica tion has demonstrable impact on patient outcomes, qua lity and safety, efficiency, patient and staff satisfaction, workf orce retention and the capacity to improve work processes. [1] The stakes c ould not be higher. In this module, we examine relationships on healthca re teams a nd describe perspectives, attitudes a nd skills that any team member or team leader can use to improve both relationships a nd team perf ormance. Most DocCom modules address relationships and eff ective communication between patients and clinicians, and we stress that application of these principles also enhances relationshi ps between healthcare team members. HOW WE THINK ABOUT TEAMS How we think a bout teams profoundly ef fects our expectations and behavior, which in turn influences the behavior of others. In this section, we examine the assumptions a nd consequences of two common perspectives on teams, one based on hierarchy and control, the other based on relation and emergence. Beliefs a bout tea ms are remarka bly self-\u00adful filling. The way we think about the roles of leaders a nd team members shapes our perceptions, expectations and behavior, which in turn influences how people behave toward us. Behaviors repeated over time become habits a nd habits become enshrined as social norms and team culture. We will consider two dif ferent team cultures, one based on hierarchy and control and the other based on relation and emergen ce. [2] Neither perspective is intrinsica lly right or wrong; rather, each is best suited to particular kinds of teams or situations. In current practice the hierarchy and control approach is used extensively so we highlight the alternative, which we call relationship-\u00adcentered administration.Hierarchy and Cont rol The hierarchy and control approach presumes that leaders know the answers and team members should do what their leaders tell them to do. This approach is detrimental to outstanding tea mwork in most situations. According to the hierarchy and control perspective, the best path to a good outcome is to have a good plan, which the leader is responsible for prepa ring and executing. A s a leader, you have control (exclusive decision-\u00adma king authority) over a specific \"territory\" that can be defined geographically (e.g., an inpatient unit or off ice practice) or by function (e.g., quality improvement or inf ormation technology). People work on projects or make use of resources within tha t territory only with your a pproval. You control the activities of the team members, specifying what work they do and how they do it, and holding them accountable. Leadership is equated with expertise: you are assumed to have the greatest knowledge and skill in your domain. The role of team members is to carry out your directions, respecting your judgment and not getting involved in the work of other territories and teams without permission. The hierarchy and control perspective has the advantage of quick and orderly decision-\u00admaking, is appropriate when a standardized process needs to be carried out with precision and dispatch, and without variability (e.g., the acute response to a patient in full ca rdiac a rrest). Only one person leads, and conflicts over decision rights and jurisdiction are minimal. And with accountability resting with you, the leader, team members are spared the anxiety of taking personal responsibility f or any of the group's failures. Nonetheless, we recognize limitations of this approach for the functioning of most teams. Concentrating authority and responsibility with you reduces the initiative and motiva tion of other group members. Communication and collaboration between teams is encumbered by the need to go through team leaders rather than directly between members of your respective teams. Unrealistic expectations of control create a nxiety: when things don't go as planned, the ensuing struggle between you and your team members over who is responsible diverts attention a nd effort from the work at hand. The apparent simplicity and efficiency of hierarchical decision-\u00admaking is often illusory. Relationship-\u00adcentered Administ ratio n The relationship-\u00adcentered a pproach involves paying careful attention to communication and relationship processes. The leader's role is to engage each tea m member's participation a nd creativity and to foster good dialog while a lso ma intaining accountability. An alternative way of thinking about teams is the relationship-\u00adcentered approach. This perspective assumes that best tea m performance emerges from good interpersonal process. A s team l eader, you attend closely to the quality of communication and relationships (a responsibility that the team members also share). You recognize that differences and unique perspectives are the source of creativity and adaptability, so you foster a n environment in which individua ls are comf ortable bringing forth differing perspectives, explore each other's opinions and are open to being changed. Plans em erge in the course of the team' s conversa tion and benefit from everyone' s thinking. Using a relationship-\u00adcentered a pproach, you strengthen commitment and motivation by engaging team members as partners, trusting and developing their ca pacity. You give team members wider latitude in determining how to do their work and in colla borating directly with members of other teams. You still hold authority and are responsible for maintaining accountability, but you do so in a relational f ashion, for example, by negotia ting individual goals and performance criteria. You view accountability as a form of service, a n opportunity to help your team and its individual members realize their best potential. Occasionally you remove someone from the team, when yourecognize and correct a mismatch of person a nd role that serves neither that individual nor the team well. Team members are responsible f or participa ting in partnership, volunteering their observations and idea s honestly and respectf ully. Leadership flows throughout the group. Anyone can suggest a new idea; anyone can make a reflection or suggestion to help facilitate the team' s interactions. ATTITUDE Before we turn to methods that foster teamwork, we must f irst consider attitude, for the result of any strategy or skill that you use depends heavily upon the spirit in which you use it. Thomas Watson Jr, who built IB M, said, \"The basic philosophy of an organization has far more to do with its achievements than do technologica l or economic resources, organiza tional structure, innovation and timing.\"[3] We describe below some a ttitudes and basic philosophy that support outstanding tea mwork. Impro visatio nal team co nsciousness Thinking about meetings as an improvisational performance rather tha n a predetermined script facilitates collaborative group participation and the emergence of unpredictable and crea tive possibilities. We often come to meetings with our own personal outcomes in mind - our plans, wa nts, grievances, opinions, data, spreadsheets, slides, and so forth. It's as if we're music ians who arrive to orchestra practice rea dy to perform our individual solos but not particularly interested in hearing what others play; or worse, only interested in listening to others for the purpose of critique a nd criticism. For a relational meeting you arrive practiced and prepa red, ready to listen responsively to others and to support their performances - like a jazz ensemble in which your own riff is highly influenced in the moment by wha t and how the other musicians are playing. The resulting improvisational perf ormance is an emerging, synergistic creation that is greater than the sum of its parts - an outcome whose specifics could not have been designed or predicted ahead of time. [4] Learner's mindset The willingness to adopt a non-\u00adexpert stance and to continue to learn f rom others creates a respectful team environment, one that is unshackled from the mindset of \"knowing\". In our healthcare culture, the expert or 'knowing' mindset is a n attitude that severely inhibits team function. We a re all trained to be knowers, and clearly knowledge and knowing are important-\u00ad-\u00ad as responsible professionals, we must have a certain level of knowledge and skill. In team situations, however, the 'know ing' mindset can prevent us f rom listening and learning. Presuming that we 'know' the problems and solutions leaves little room f or hearing other's thoughts or opinions, and even less room for combining our individual knowledge in creative ways. An alternative approa ch would be to hold your perspectives more lightly and to be willing to explore someone else's perspective even as you continue to hold y our own. This mindset is oftenreferred to as the humble learner's or 'beginner' s mind' [5] It's an approach of curiosity and open-\u00ad mindedness rather than dogmatic close-\u00admindedness. It's the type of mindset you have when you come to a new situation, or that a social scientist brings to the explora tion of a new culture or setting. It frees you f rom the shackles and burden of your own knowing and allows you to listen, learn, wonder, a nd grow. Value difference Members on high perf orming teams value their differences and respectfully challenge a nd disagree with each other, stimulating dialog and creativity. The voicing of differences is critical to crea ting value in an organization; for only through exploring our disagreements can we learn from one another. People too of ten sit in meetings in silent disagreement. Perhaps they do not care enough to speak up, or do not wish to challenge someone for fear of hurting their feelings, or perhaps they fear rejection, exclusion or humiliation. Indeed, it takes courage and skill to speak up honestly and respectfully - to be truthf ul and also acknowledge other peoples' truths. This courage and skill are critical ingredients of meaningf ul conversations and productive meetings. In one very successful organization that we've studied, there's a saying - ' if two people agree with ea ch other th en one of them is superf luous' . Difference stimulates new ideas and possibilities. Silent disagreement deprives others of the opportunity to receive important feedback, and foments a nger, resentment and pa ssivity. Silence also robs us of the opportunity to lea rn and grow through having our own ideas challenged. Check o ut the video example about \"value difference\" on the left. An alternative approa ch is to locate the courage to acknowledge how much you care, to offer your honest, genuine perspective in a respectful wa y that skillfully invites others to voice their disagreement in turn. Expressing yourself genuinely at meetings and encouraging others to do so enhances the possibilities for understanding a nd creativity. This approach values difference and diversity and creates a n open and pa rticipatory environment. Passive resistance, the silent killer, evaporates. Appreciat e capabilities o f others An approach that apprecia tes capacities and successes, rather than one tha t focuses on f laws and problems, allows teams to create a better f uture by bringing along the best of their past. The word ' apprecia te' ha s a number of meanings, including both to recognize the value in someone or something, and to increase the value of someone or something. Our experience is that individua ls in organizations seldom do this - we often underestima te the value of our colleagues and co-\u00adworkers, much less elevate or increase their value. We look for flaws or problems without recognizing the good things, a nd we may also appl y that same \"pathologizing gaze\" to ourselves.We rarely make the eff ort to assist one another in appreciating tha t value. Check o ut the video example about \"appreciate capabilities of others\" on the left. An alternative approa ch is one of appreciation. Experience and experiment have shown that the more capacity you perceive the more likely it is that people will rise to meet those expectations (a self-\u00adfulf illing prophecy). So in reflecting on your daily work and especia lly in promoting change, you can cast your attention out toward the positive - what's working, what we want more of - rather than towards wha t's not working.[6] D uring meetings you ca n value team members through recognizing each other' s capacities and increa se your value through a cknowledging the team' s successes. Beco me co mfortable with uncertainty The ability to tolera te uncertainty and hold back the rush to resolution creates space for team members to brainstorm, present and tweak new ideas and implement creative solutions. One of the pitfalls of many meetings is the overwhelming desire to describe and quickly f ix problems, to find solutions, to make decisions and check those items off the list. Our quest f or control makes us anxious with uncertainty, because we equate uncertainty with incompetence, failure or diff icult conversations a nd intera ctions. Too often in our rush to resolution, we focus prematurely and narrow our vision of the range of possibilities. In doing so, we miss the voices and ideas at the periphery - innovations that a re just the germ of an idea, or that might make little sense at f irst blush but which eventually could off er new solutions. We fail to allow space with uncertainty in order to see what new patterns might em erge. An alternative approa ch is to embrace \"not knowing\" - to recognize that it ca n be a virtue rather than a fault. Removing the fears associated with uncertainty makes room f or free-\u00adflowing brainstorming and open dialog, and allows a group to go beyond formulaic tools or approaches. It also lets a group recognize when it needs more time to simply sit with the question. Reflect on pro cess Spending ti me on 'how we are working together' boosts efficiency by resolving inevitable frictions and misunderstandings before they become serious impediments to productivity. In our desire to be productive, our meetings often concentrate a ttention on the content of the work at hand. We' re all about the ' what'. Rarely do we focus on the patterns of power and relating and the values we enact as we work\u2014the 'how' of working together. Many dismiss such reflection as 'touchy-\u00adfeely' , 'navel-\u00adgazing' and a fruitless a waste of time. But what really wa stes time and impairs team perf ormance are conf lict, misunderstanding and mistrust, nearly all of which is preventable and solvable if we take the time to reflect on how we are working together.An alternative approa ch is to recognize the importance of paying attention to relationships and communication processes. Exploring each other' s perceptions and addressing the inevita ble frictions and misunderstandings of daily work while they are still minor prevents enormous amounts of extra work. A regular discipline of reflecting on \"how we are working together\" ca n improve ef ficiency a nd save time. Peter D rucker, one of the greatest management scholars, described this type of activity as the most critical and primary responsibility of each and every individua l in an organization. [7] COMMUNICATION SKILLS Our daily lives are packed with interactions as we work on teams, meet in hallways, and congregate at meetings. Each interaction is an opportunity to strengthen relationships, exchange information and generate ideas. This section describes skills that enhance your awareness, responsivenes s and effectiveness as a supportive co-\u00adworker, meeting participant or team leader. The skills f or effective clinical communication described in other modules of D ocCom are valuable in fostering teamwork and relationship-\u00adcentered a dministration. When we use these interactional skills in meetings and other conversations, we create patterns of relating tha t fashion and shape a relationship-\u00adcentered cultur e within our teams and for the organiza tion as a whole. Self-\u00adawareness You can learn to notice where you a re focusing your a ttention and wha t assumptions and judgments you are making. You can be aware that a n inner voice is distracting you and return your a ttention to what you are experiencing right here, right now. Have you ever noticed your mind during a meeting? So often an inner voice judges wha t is happening or rehearses what you intend to say next, or perhaps occupies your mind with idea s not related to the present interaction. These ever-\u00adpresent messa ges can be distracting and keep you from being f ully present; or they can focus you on the present and your current experience. Whether they are distra ctions or insights depends upon your capacity to observe yourself - your self-\u00adawareness. Self-\u00adawareness encompasses mindfulness of body, f eelings a nd mind itself , as noted in Table 1 Table 1: Va rieties of mindfulness (adapted from [8]) Types o f MindfulnessExamples o f self-\u00adobservatio ns Mindfulness of the bodybreath, conta ct, movements, communication via body posture, proximity to others; unpleasant and plea sant bodily bumps\" Mindfulness of emotionsexcitement, fear of embarrassment, anger, anxiety, heaviness, acceptance, (identification of your emotions may heighten sensitivity to others' emotions - similar to counter-\u00adtransference with patients) Mindfulness of mindalertness/attentiveness, distra ction, associations, assumptions, fears, desires (for a further discussion of mindfulness and self-\u00adawareness, please see module 2)Active listening Active listening is more than passively receiving inf ormation. Reflect back what you've heard to show speakers that you understand wha t they are communicating. An inaccurate reflection will show them both that you are interested and tha t you've not yet understood. As a skilled listener you convey genuine interest through nonverbal behaviors such as posture, eye contact, head and body movements and fa cial expressions, a nd also through a n open and curious line of inquiry. Expressing your curiosity by not steering conversation towards a premeditated goal allows speakers to lead you through their ideas and experience. Skillfully echoing speakers' phrases or paraphrasing what you've heard not only demonstrates your interest in accurately tracking their thoughts, but also creates an o pportunity to discover what you do not understand to help you get back on track. Present your thinking Presenting your perspectives enhances both the diversity available to the group a nd the willingness of members to contribute to the dialog. Speaking your truth contributes to a culture of frank open discussion and serves to enhances that culture when your perspective differs f rom others' . Explain h ow you f ormed your opinion and give the data on which it's based. Take a moment to describe what meaning it has for you or what you have at stake. Your f rankness can make it easier for others to speak up. Your transparency enhances openness, and encourages others to make their a ssumptions a nd reasoning available to all. Harness difference and diversity Diversity is valua ble because it opens new a nd bro ader possibilities. Team members who manage to \"look out\" through each other' s eyes understand situations more comprehensively and wisely than they could with a narrower, individual perspective. Underlying all our positions are assumptions, belief s, rationales and logic. Striving f or self -\u00ad awareness of these underpinnings enables us to hold them up f or examination. Making them available to inquiry by others and exploring the way others think can open us to new ways of understanding, which cannot be done if we \"dig in our heels\" and cling to \"the way it is.\" Maintaining a beginner's mind - being willing to \"not know\"- allows the differences to become the spark of a transforming new idea. Resist the common temptation to mistake difference for rejection or to make immediate judgments about what is right or wrong. Hold multiple perspectives simultaneously and stay engaged with exploration of differences so as to move beyond \"either-\u00ador\" a nd recognize more complex realities.Check o ut the video example about \"harnessing difference and diversity\" on the left. Stay engaged despit e conflict Displays of strong emotions ca n evoke reactions that destabilize the group's focus. If we get defensive, lash back, give in to the temptation to withdraw or smooth over diff erences instea d of responding compassiona tely, we miss creative or transforming insights. Seeking creative a nd transforming results inevitably surfaces conflicts between team members. Awareness of your own emo tions, the ability to name them and a willingness to notice and name others' feelings is a crucial factor in group success. Acknowledging and naming your own or others' emot ions helps groups creatively hold the tension of the conf lict and re-\u00adopen us to dialog. The willingness to hear each voice even when pass ionately expressed builds trust and gives the group the benef it of each member's truth. B oth demonstrating respect and part nership using relationship-\u00adbuilding statements (PEARLS - see Table 2 below) and restating and checking common goals keep the team vital and restores its focus. Subjects tha t would otherwise become sources of discord a nd fractiousness become discussable. Even more, they become wind ows to deeper insights. Table 2: PEARLS build team relationships. Relationship statements, summarized by the mnemonic PEARLS , were presented in the context of the patient-\u00adclinician relationship (see modules 6, 13). These communica tion skills a re equally useful f or building relationships in tea ms. The chart below offers examples. (adapted from [9]) PartnershipCollaboration and teamwork, common goals and v ision, joint problem solving.\"We all want what's best f or the patient. I know that we will figure this out together.\" EmpathyRecognize and addressemotion. Put feelings into words. Point out low/high energy levels.\"You look f rustrated about this.\" Or, \"I' m feeling low energ y right now, can we take a quick check on how others a re feeling?\" Apology, AcknowledgementAdmit errors, show concern f or mistakes a nd ta ke responsibility.\"I acknowledge tha t I should have contacted each of you sooner about this.\" RespectGive credits, a ppreciative comments and positive feedback. Value group members' behaviors.\"I apprecia te that you've brought that point up. \"I' m impressed with the strength of your convictions.\" LegitimizationNormalize and validate feelings, choices and responses.\"I don't blame you for feeling that way. Anyone in your shoes would feel the same.\"SupportMaintain an optimistic, open attitude.\"I know we' re going to figure this out. \"I'm willing to stay in conversation a bout this.\" Make pro cess reflectio ns Members who comment on group interactions can stimulate a team to adopt more congruent and transparent dialog patterns that contribute to both the team' s cohesiveness and its effectiveness. Awareness of your own emotions or degree of engagement in the dialog can help you monitor other members' engagement. This tracking is the organizational equivalent of using your own feelings (counter-\u00adtra nsference) to understand those of a patient. Take a moment to observe your feelings during a difficult or conf using spot, and then observe the other team members. Their posture, expressions and other nonverbal signs may help you discern their f eelings and engagement. At such moments, you might notice incongruence between what you discern and what is being said; for example, expressing verbal agreement while showing disengagement through f lattened voice tones or slouched posture. D isengagement sometimes indicates the presence of important issues that no one is bringing forth f or discussion. Speak your observations as a method of calling attention to the team's current beha vior and situation. This provides the group a n opportunity to be more mindful of its own process, to consider new and more forthright interactive patterns and to regulate itself more effectively. Your transparency may stimulate members to develop their own self-\u00adawareness and communication skills. (See module 14 about \"nonverbal communication\") MEETING PROCESSES \"Microskills\" of relationship centered practices are intended to introduce and reinf orce patterns of partn ership and colla boration. They can help your team break out of frustrating patterns of relating so that meetings become more ef fective and enga ging. In this section we hope to give you tips on improving your meeting performance - whether as a participant or the chair. Executive skills such as time-\u00adkeeping, rules of order or decision-\u00admaking processes are important, but not our f ocus. [10] Instead, we describe meeting strategies that build on the attitudes a nd skills considered above. In meetings, how we interact and respond to one another can have more long lasting impact on outcomes and results than what we actually talk about. So it's worth learning interactive skills tha t respond to typical meeting dyna mics- a nd knowing that any new ways of participating that you employ may eventually dif fuse and spread in ways that impact work in other areas of your organization. Meetings ha ve a beginning, middle and end - each with a specific purpose. We will consider each of these in turn. Beginning a meeting The first 10 minutes of the meeting, devoted to greeting, checking in and establishing agenda, set the stage for the tone a nd effectiveness of the entire meeting. Table 3 lists the opening tasks of a meeting and itemizes specif ic contributions f or which the Chair and Participants should take responsibility. Chairs a nd participants who attend to these tasks bring team members together and address problems and concerns that can delay or derail the work if not managed early. We give more specif ic and detailed consideration to check-\u00adin and agenda negotiation in subsequent paragraphs.

Check o ut the video example about \"checking in\" on a team that meets on a regular base. Check-\u00adin is a simple technique which can achieve many things:assist participants in transitioning from a previous activity a nd setting aside extraneous concerns and distractions; reorient and f ocus participants on this team's task. improve trust and build relationships by helping participants know each other better. invite every participants' voice into the room at the very outset; bring everyone together enhance interactional skills that can improve team function Check o ut the video example about \"checking in\" on a team that meets f or the f irst time. Table 4 outlines check-\u00adin f ormats, and includes sample questions. In each format, the chair and other participants should give each other the opportunity to \"pass\". Forcing people to self-\u00addisclose can diminish the sense of trust and safety in the group. \"Whoever would like to start, please do and others please join in as you are ready...And as alwa ys, please feel f ree to pass.\" In the press of urgent business, it' s often tempting to skip check-\u00adin to \"get on with the work.\" This is usually a false economy. Helping people get connected and calibrated makes the conversation more efficient a nd less prone to time-\u00adwasting distractions, misunderstandings and conflicts. Check in may occur before or after you negotia te the agenda. Experiment with this! Find out what your group pref ers.

Nego tiate t he Agenda Negotiating an agenda as a group ensures that everyone has the chance to clarify the \"sha red purpose\" and content of the work. At the process level, this activity underscores the collaborative intentions of the chair. Negotiating an agenda facilita tes sharing responsibility for managing the group' s time and pla nning its work. Agenda setting is similar to the beginning of a clinical interview when you discuss the shared goals for the appointment, establishing the values of sha red responsi bility and collaboration. To negotiate an agenda, you can either ask for last minute changes to an agenda that has been sent out ahead of time, or you can receive suggestions to construct a n agenda on the spot. Once all topics are listed, you can decide upon sequence and priority. If there are too many items for one meeting, you can decide together how a nd when to address the other items.

Avoid Muddled Middles Meetings commonly derail or lose f ocus. The lea der and all participants share responsibility for attempting to change an ineff ective pattern by suggesting that participa nts try a new strategy. You're all ch ecked-\u00adin; the agenda is approved. People are engaged, energy is high; you're moving through the agenda, making decisions and creatively exploring important issues. Meetings ca n proceed that smoothly, but sometimes they don't. We might find ourselves rehashing old issues orre-\u00adenacting ineffective communication patterns. Perhaps participation is low, or the same one or two people monopolize the conversation. The meeting gets sidetracked, energy drops. Table 5 presents some common stuck situations and suggests interventions for managing them. None is guaranteed to work - but trying new interventions is essential when your current practices aren't working. Any participant (not just the chair) can suggest or utilize these techniques. Check o ut the video example of ineffective communication patterns. What patterns can you identify, and how would you remedy them within a meeting? Table 5: Met hods fo r mo ving a team away from ineffect ive patterns Descript ion of Ineffective PatternPossible Intervent ionss Not enough time to explore issues properly; not everyone can contributeParallel Co nversat ions: invite pairs or other small group to discuss an issue for 5 minutes with or without \"reporting back\" (the additional discussion often helps move everyone along). Stories are eff ective experiences to share in dyads. Click here for an example movie showing \"pairing up\" Same people talk all the time; never hear from \"quiet\" onesGo Around: Each person is invited to take a turn to speak without interruption and always with the opportunity to pass or, if they a re not yet ready to speak, to come back to them later. Disorderly conversation;many people trying to speak at onceTalking stick: One can only speak while holding a symbolic \"talisma n\" - a ceremonial stick or bean bag or a ny other object. Sometimes a little structure helps to ensure hearing the full diversity of opinions and to slow down conversation enough to listen to one another. Click here for an example movie showing the \"talking stick\" Nominal gro up pro cess: This varia tion on the Go Around is a rapid brainstorming technique. Proceeding around the room in order, participants make one brief suggestion at a time which is recorded on a blackboard or flip chart without discussion. The brainstorming continues f or as many rounds as necessary until there are no further new ideas. Only then are the ideas discussed and evaluated. People continue assertingopposing views without listening to each otherBalancing inquiry and advo cacy: Ef fective group participation means inquiring in to the point of view and needs of others as ardently as you advoca te for your own. It also implies a willingness to be changed by wha t someone else says. Peter D rucker, in his last published article, admonished executives to \"listen first, spea k last\". [4]Participants are not saying what they are reallythinkingNaming t he elephant: Giving voice to what is not being talked about. Describe the issue or the relational pattern in a descriptive and non-\u00adjudgmental way, e.g.: \"I notice that we' re not talking about whose staf f is going to be cut\" or \"We haven't yet addressed the conflict that's in the room.\" You can a lso use a Go Around to ask \"what important thing s are we not talking about?\" Wicked questio ns: Sometimes there's a way of tilting a n issue 180 degrees or coming at it from a paradoxical direction. For instance, instead of the question - \"how do we find more time for our quality meetings\" you might ask \"how does paying so much attention to meeting a bout quality interfere with our a bility to provide quality service?\" Or \"what would a system that was perfectly designed to fail look like?\" A wicked question usually starts with \"how\" - often there is no clear answer. A good wicked question will help surface a paradox or tension which ca n be f ruitful to explore more deeply. [11] Actively seek disagreement : \"I'll bet there are some other perspectives on this, and it would be valuable f or us to hear and understand them.\" Conversationis jumping around withou t coherence; it's hard to know what is going onReflective silence: give people 1-\u00ad2 minutes of silence in which to gather their thoughts before returning to issue at hand. This ca n also be useful after a very intense a nd successful piece of dialog. Click here for an example movie showing \"ref lective silence\" Meta-\u00adreflect ion: take a time out from the conversation for a Go Around inviting people to reflect on how the conversation is going. Reflective self-\u00addisclosure: As an alternative to observing what is happening with the group, it can be f acilitative to observe what is happening f or you. For example, \"I'm having this gnawing feeling in my stomach at this moment. Something is making me uncomfortable and I'm not quite sure what it is.\" Or, \"I notice that I'm f eeling really a ntsy. I guess I'm hoping we can g et into a deeper conversation.\" End Elegantly The end of a meeting is also the beginning of your subsequent work - and of your next meeting. It's an opportunity to clarify commitments (a brief summary of actions and decisions) and to improve the team's capacity f or feedback and working together. A brief debriefing or checkout is an effective technique f or building relationships and helping the team \"calibrate\" how it's working together. As a meeting moves toward closure, summarize any agreements, decisions and action commitments that members made. Take this opportunity to ensure that everyone has a common understanding a nd remind people of their specific tasks. Rather than ending with that summary , however, a usef ul and stimulating practice is to conduct a quick debrief ing or check out. The structure is similar to check in, and extends an invitation to participants to reflect on the meeting through a \"Go-\u00adround\" (with the invitation to pass) or \"popcorn style\" (in no order, each person speaks when ready).Check o ut the video example about \"checking out\" Participants have a n opportunity to recognize one another' s contributions and to give positive reinforcement to behaviors that contributed to the meeting' s success. This consolidates learning and increases the likelihood that those behaviors will occur in subsequent meetings. Also, like check-\u00adin, it helps people get to know each other better a nd builds relationships. Table 6 presents severa l possibilities f or the specific f ocus of a \"check out.\" Table 6: Suggest ions fo r \"Check-\u00ado ut\" f DebriefDescript ion Potential Benefit s Apprecia tive Debriefing\"I'd like to invite each of us to check out by telling another person of a moment when that person said or did something that was helpful to you.\"Reinforces desired behaviors Builds positive regard among tea m members Builds team ca pacity by noticing and sharing what works Action Steps\"I'd like to go around with a check out and have everyone claim an action step they are committed to trying in the next week.\"Clarifies and consolidatescommitmentEnds meeting on positive note - helpsin transition f rom \"decision\" to \"action\" Personal reflection\"I'd like to invite each of us to check out with a brief word about how we were impacted by the meeting today - perhaps something you will think about and carry with you until our next meeting.\"Helps team deepen understanding of one anotherShows how shared events impact each one of usProvides opportunity for persona l consolidation of meaningful experience Openinvitation\"Let's have a brief checkout - where are you at now that our meeting is drawing to a close?\"Invites personal reflection and calibration between team members Builds group \"history\" SUMMARY A team is at its best when a ll its members can be fully present, holding the richness of their diversity as their most valuable resource, and when they can simultaneously influence and be influenced by each other. These are the conditions under which new ideas are most likely to emerge; this is the path to innovation and resourcef ulness. And most important, participants' presence and openness to influencing each other makes the team' s work ef fective, enjoyable, creative and meaningful. In this module, we' ve examined a comprehensive a nd practical framework f or improving communication and pa rtnership on teams, including attitudes, skills and strategies. Perhaps an effective way to summarize this material is to return to comparison of the hierarchy-\u00adcontrol perspective a nd relationship-\u00adcentered admini stration, and to fill in more deta il (Table 7).

How do you def ine a fully f unctioning clinician? 2. What does it take to function f ully, and continue through an entire ca reer?3. Think of a time when your ef forts to work at a high level were challenged. What was it like? How did you deal with it? With whom did you speak about it, and how did they respond? What would have helped you deal with it even more ef fectively? 4. What do you think of when you think of an impaired or distressed clinician? 5. Recall a situation in which a peer appeared impaired in some way - or imagine such a situation. What would you say, and to whom? Where could you get help about this? What are consequences if you do nothing? Key Principles: 1. Every clinicia n experiences times when their capacity to perform well professionally is subject to stress of some kind. 2. Ethical a nd legal mandates cha rge us to intervene with any colleague who might be impaired. 3. Many impairments can be prevented, and others effectively treated. 4. Initiation of conversa tion with a possibly impaired colleague requires coura ge to overcome personal and societal obstacles, particularly when the colleague is of \"equal or higher\" status. 5. Effective intervention calls f or respectful a ttitudes and empathic communication skills. 6. Some situations require immediate and def initive intervention by the person witnessing the unacceptable beha vior. Learning go als: At the co nclusion o f this mo dule, yo u will be able to : Describe diverse ways in which a high level of professional performance ca n be impaired. Remember a time when you had diff iculty performing well as a clinician or student, and describe the contributing fa ctors, how your work was af fected, and how colleagues communicated with you. List reasons for taking action about impaired colleagues, rather than remaining silent. Describe and demonstrate skills f or effective communication with colleagues who are distressed or impaired in some way. Note: This Module is not intended to prepare participants for the prof essiona l assessment, treatment, or monitoring of impaired clinicians, but f or the recognition of possible impairment and initial intervention by/as a colleag ue.INTRODUCTION Clinician rates of impairment from substance a buse and from psychiatric and physica l disability are at least as high a s the general population. Successful conduct of work as a healthcare provider requires high levels of cognitive ability, emotional balance, unimpaired consciousness, flexibility and competence with communication and teamwork skills, a s well as a physiological state that is stable and suited to the individua l's practice. Every clinician experiences times when their capacity in one or more of these domains may be diminished by stressors such as physical or emotional illness, family or social problems or dysfunctional work environments. As a clinician, you owe allegiance to both your colleagues and to a prof essiona l standard of ethics and behavior, and above all you owe a commitment to patients' sa fety. The World Health Organization (1948) defines health as \"a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-\u00adbeing, a nd not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\". POOR STRESS ADAPTATION PRODUCES IMPAIRMENT Clinician training may promote maladaptive responses to stress. The strengths that assure success in medicine, such as diligence and high degrees of responsibility and c ompulsivity, may a lso predispose clinicians to considerable internal stress, particula rly as control over the workplace is relinquished to group practices a nd corporate management. We often fail to identify our distress and ask f or help. Additionally, we seldom intervene with distressed colleagues. In a 2010 study only 64% of surveyed clinicians agreed with the commitment to report possibly impaired c olleagues. In medical school a nd residency, the \"hidden curriculum\" reinforces coping silently with sleep deprivation, a demanding specia lty rotation or the inappropriate senior attending. In response to such stresses, you may have learned maladaptive or even unprof essional strategies. Consider the distancing tactic of calling undesirable or demanding patients by sarcastic or demeaning names. Clinician s must adapt to the many stresses intrinsic to the practice of medicine, and life itself. On many occasions our professional f unctioning is impacted by stress. Stressors include periodic sleep deprivation, mistakes (whether hidden or known only to the clinicia n), deaths of beloved patients, legal, economic or pra ctice dif ficulties, and \"ordinary\" life stressors such as the arrival of a new child, deat h of a parent or emergence or complications of a personal health problem. Continual effective functioning in medical practice requires personal resilience and ef fective coping skills. Among clinicia ns, there is a t least a 16% lifetime incidence of major depressive disorders. Estimates of clinician alcohol dependence range between 8% and 15%, compared with 13.5% in the US adult US population. Data on p hysical illness among clinicians are scant but an estimated 10% of clinicians will experience disa bling physica l illness at some time in their ca reers. Many clinicians successfully a dapt. Further, diligent and caref ul clinicians of ten compensate for such difficulties as sensory disturbances (deafness etc), diabetes, well-\u00adcontrolled bipolar disorder, cancer and orthopedic impairments. IMPAIRMEN TS AND DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIORS The list of situations that impair high level professional functioning is diverse a nd manifold, limited only by our experience and imagina tion. A patient of mine, a competent and conscientious surgeon, went to the operating room despite knowing that he had a clinical condition with high probability of having deep venous thrombosis and a subsequent pulmonary embolism. Both the preoccupation with his illness and hypoxemia could have been signif icant. He and the patient were lucky, and there was no adverse outcome. Only af ter hospital admission for pulmonary embolism did he acknowledge his \"bad judgment\" in operating that day. \"Disruptive\" behaviors impair the professional functioning of the clinicia n and the interdisciplinary team. Some disruptive behaviors are the following: inappropriate humor, loss of temper, inappropriate or abusive langua ge, and nonverba l behaviors such as appearing a ngry, irritable, unapproachable, or arrogant. These beha viors often accompany impa irments described in this module, but may occur alone. The term \"disruptive clinician\" is nonspecific, and often pejorative. Recent policy changes by the Joint Commission require accrediting bodies to develop and implement policies and procedures for the identification and remediation of disruptive behaviors, lending additiona l urgency to the topic. When clinicians are disruptive, intervention techniques are similar to those described below for other impairments. Impairments in communica tion ability, consciousness, physical functioning or cognitive performance are common. Communication skills can be impaired by everything from earwax to keratitis to dysphasia. Consciousness is af fected by medications, intoxication of all kinds, sleep deprivation, acute or chronic illness, or the many va rieties of life stress tha t afflict everyone. Physical functioning varies with specia lty: a fractured wrist would be significant in a surgical specialty, awkward in pediatrics, and possibly a mere nuisance in psychia try. Cognitive performance is a ffected by everything f rom licit a nd illicit drugs and alcohol, insufficient sleep, neurolo gical diseases and psychia tric disorders. Fluctua and even \"normal aging\" may impair cognition. PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT Early identification allows for treatment or management of impairments. Resident f atigue is a n example of impairment that is being prevented through regulation. Module 4 describes tactics and strategies that prevent impairments by helping find or restore personal ba lance within the context of learning medicine and providing medical care. The sleep deprivation tacitly required by medical tra ining and practice has come under intense scrutiny and is regulated by prof essional and public agencies because of its documented impact on professiona l function and lapses in patient saf ety. At the level of the ward team we are required to notice our exhausted colleagues, insist that they rest, and finish their work f or them. These interventions necessitate more f requent \"handoff s\" that require vigilance to assure continuity of care. Physica l ailments are often overcome with occupational therapy or special devices. Some impairments, for example depression or situational stress, ma y be more difficult to identif y but are effectively managed when diagnosis is made. Regular healt h maintenance a nd screening for stresses a nd impairments through a steady relationship with a primary care clinicia n facilita tes diagnosis and mana gement of these types of disorders. Check o ut the video example about resident colleagues providing validation and support for each other, through their common experiences of long and frequent call nights. Video exercise: View this video a nd reflect upon your own simila r experiences. How do (or did) you ma nage similar dif ficulties for yourself and others? What are the important personal and systems issues? SPEAK UP! Because impairments ri sk patient injury, we must intervene whenever we are concerned that a colleague might be impaired. The ACP Ethics Manual states clearly that \"clinicia ns who are impaired for any reason must refrain from assuming patient responsibilities that they may not be able to discharge safely and effectively...and there is a clear ethica l responsibility to report a clinician who seems to be impaired to an appropria te authority.\" Statutes vary f rom state to state, but some states require you, if you observe an impaired collea gue, to report the colleague to state authorities, a nd there may be penalties f or neglecting to do so. Impediment s to intervent ion Many obstacles impede the clinicia n's urge to support an impaired colleague. Because patient safety is paramount, overcoming societal, professional and internal or personal ba rriers to reach out to collea gues is essential. Communication difficulties, issues of power and concerns about shame and loyalty top the list of impediments to both good intentions a nd the ethica l, regulatory, statutory and patient saf ety imperatives that call for action. Lack of skill and experience: Medical training rarely includes learning skills f or helping a n impaired colleague. Some senior management courses do include such training, but we often avoid, miss or are even excluded f rom these discussions. Thus, few of us have either experience or a specific idea of how to proceed when confronted with an emergent situation. Unequal po wer: Medicine is rife with hierarchies, such as student/resident/attending, young/old, male/female, generalist/sub-\u00adspecialist, and staff/chief. Even the idea of confronting colleagues in positions of authority about a difference of opinion, much less about issues of clinician impairment intimidates most of us. If you are a student, you ma y feel in particular jeopardy since you a re often in the most junior position (12). Fear of reprisal, perceptions of lack of respect, or pa inful past experiences impede students. Conflicting lo yalties/ bet rayal: So metimes you may be unclea r to whom you owe your loyalty. Your actions could seem an a ct of personal betrayal even in the face of your obligations to thepatient, your progra m, or your practice. For example, suppose you are conf ronting or reporting an impaired colleague such as a fellow student or resident. Perha ps you have suspicions a bout a practice partner with whom you are quite close and share family events and other social times. Shame and guilt: Aa ron Lazare (13) has written a bout the role of shame and guilt in medicine. Clinicians share cultural belief s with the general population, notably the idea that impairment suggests weakness. There fore, the inability to perf orm well f or any reason is embarrassing and shamef ul. As a clinician observing a colleague you may recognize that risk of shame and, perhaps identifying with your colleague, become reluctant to discuss your concerns. When confronted, impaired clinicians often react defensively a gainst the possibility of frailty. Boundary issues: Conf ronting colleagues who are friends or pra ctice partners about personal issues seems invasive and often seems like a violation of personal boundaries. Perfect ion and medical culture: The idea that the clinician should be close to perfect f osters collective denial within the culture of medicine, as well a s society at large. We can't be impaired, we've jumped Olympian hurdles. As one senior resident put it, \"I have sla ved and struggled to get here, and I don' t make mistakes! \" Check o ut the video example about recognizing impairment from f atigue and ef fectively assisting the colleague. Video exercise: As you watch the video, listen f or the obstacles the resident tells her friend about. Imagine what other obstacles there might be for you. How would you suggest she deal with them? RECOGNIZE EARLY CLUES Diminished quality of work is a relatively late ma nifestation of impairment. In order to intervene early, attend to behaviora l cues a nd clues tha t might indicate problems. Early behaviora l clues that may be evident to an observant collea gue include changes in work habits such as tardiness, missing rounds, absenteeism or failure to complete ta sks. Other cues such as lapses into irrita bility, mood disturbances, social isolation, or abusive language often precede full-\u00adblown impairment. Eventually, the quality of work may diminish and be recognized by missed diagnoses, multiple patient or collegial complaints or inappropriate prescribing. Obvious signs of cognitive or motor impairment, such as might occur with a neurological disorder, severe arthritis, or intoxication, should be acted on without delay. Ethics and at titudes Intervention is difficult. Trust that your colleague shares with you a wish to do well by pa tientsand society. For best results, maintain attitudes of respect and non-\u00addefensive responding. The eff ectiveness of a conversation with a possibly impaired collea gue springs from trusting that his or her concern f or patients overrides personal concerns, even when observations suggest otherwise. It requires courage to approach a peer or a senior clinician, whether the situation is fairly clear (slurred speech and alcohol on the breath) or suspected (perhaps from a declining quality of work). Take the time to talk with supportive collea gues, administration or other professionals and examine your a ttitudes and potentia l conflicts about loyalty, shame and perfection. Recall your personal commitment to the overlapping communities in which you participate, including care of individua l patients, the larger society and the profession. Remember tha t the ethics of your commitment to society a nd patien t safety overrides relationships with individual clinicia ns. Preparat ion Take time to decide how and when to intervene, and who else should be involved. Review principles of difficult conversations, and remember that the conversation will arouse strong emotions f or both you and the colleague. The primary risk of delay is harm to patients, so do not wait for \"more evidence\" and proceed with interven tion as soon as possible following a rousal of any concerns, worries or suspicions. A face-\u00ad to-\u00adface conversation is warranted a nd provides opportunity to both express concerns and of fer support. When definite evidence of error, poor care or repeated problems in teamwork exist, involve someone in a position of authority, regardless of whether you choose to discuss the situation in person with your collea gue. Compose yourself , as you would for any \"diff icult conversation.\" Approach a conversa tion with a n attitude of respect f or the ef fort that medical care demands of clinicians. Your commitment to addressing thorny issues of impairment in an empathic and non-\u00ad judgmental manner, bolstered by a dedication to respond non-\u00addef ensively if the colleague reacts badly assures a reasonable if not entirely satisfactory outcome. Acknowledging in conversation the importance of a trusting a nd respectful relationship and a para llel concern f or the colleague' s well-\u00adbeing paves the way for additional conversa tions, as needed. Set aside suff icient time -\u00ad if impairment from drugs or a lcohol is likely, morning may be a good time f or intervention. Select a private setting. Prepare to respond to denial, guilt or a nger. Review the modules on building relationship (module 6), responding to strong emotions (module 13), delivering bad news (module 33) or the corresponding section on bad news in module 35 on discussing unexpected outcomes and errors. Check o ut the video example about strategic planning for intervention when a n observation of possible impairment involves a senior colleague.Video exercise: If you suspect a colleague of impairment, how might you seek a trusted colleague f or help in planning ef fective intervention? Whom would you call? How might they respond? THE CONVERSATION An opportunity f or a conversation with a potentially impaired colleague is not common. Review these examples and practice wha t you might say. Although you will f ind your own words, here are some example openings in differing situations: With someone yo u kno w well, and with o nly mino r clues: \"Bill, I need to talk with you about a concern of mine.\" (a warning) \"We've been working together f or a long time and I've a lways admired your work.\" (statement of respect) \"Lately, however, I've been noticing......(description of behaviors that you have observed)\" \"I'm worried.\" (statement of concern) \"Can you tell me what's going on?\" (a request) With someone yo u kno w less well, and with minimal evid ence: \"Dr. Jones, I know we have not worked tog ether much....(acknowledgment of relationship) \"I need to talk with you about something concerning to me.\" (a warning) \"It is rather awkward because we do not know each other well.\" (acknowledgment of difficulty) \"When I consulted on your patient yesterda y I noticed...\" (description of behaviors that you have observed) \"I was concerned about....\" (statement of concern) \"Can you tell me what is going on?\" (a request) With a senio r colleague, and wit h minimal evidence: \"Dr. Thompson, I know you're the senior (use title)....and I am just a junior staff member...\" (acknowledgment of relationship) \"I am really f eeling stuck. Can I speak with you?\" (acknowledgment of difficulty) \"On the one hand, you are my supervisor. On the other hand, I am also responsible f or my patients.\" (a cknowledgment of your personal position) \"I am worried about what is going on tonight.\" (statement of concern) \"I am sure I smelled alcohol on your breath\" (behavioral description of your observations) \"I am worried about your going into surgery.\" (statement of concern) Check o ut the video example about a resident confronting the attending regarding possible impairment. Video exercise: If you have been in a similar situation, how did it go for you? How might you have handled the situation differently? Concern for impairment with evidence and requiring repo rt to perso n in aut hority: \"Dr. Y, I am afraid I cannot handle this on my own, and I am also responsible for my observations. I need to speak with the Chair about this situation. I hope you canunderstand.\" Speaking to the person in autho rity: \"Dr. X, I don' t know wha t to do. I have been working with Dr. Y, and I have noticed.....He and I have spoken a lready and he knows I am coming to you. I need to put this in your hands.\" Dangero us situat ions Some situations pose immediate risk to the patient and require action \"in the moment.\" Dangerous situations include an apparently intoxicated clinician, a colleagu e expressing out of control anger, or a variety of unacceptable beha viors (eg demeaning, ra cist, sexist, vulgar speech or humor, etc). These colleagues a re impaired in their a bility to behave in a professiona l manner, although not all of the individuals are \"impaired\" in a medical or psychiatric sense. The result is the sa me: the witness or witnesses become aware of dangerous behavior and need to intervene immediately by making a clear statement of what they observe, the perceived danger and what needs to happen at the moment. The nature of the concern, for example, immediate patient saf ety, group or individua l safety/integrity or safety of the protagonist guides the statement that is made. You may feel worried, frightened, offended, angry, shut down, or \"merely\" very uncomfortable. When you are clear tha t \"something must be done\", ask for the assistance of someone who is present, or, if alone, speak up. Although you will f ind your own words, here are some example openings in differing situa tions: With a patient in danger: To Dr. T (who appears intoxicated or otherwise impaired) and D r. J (team member): \"Can you help me? I am very unsure this case is going well. I need to check with both of you before we go any f urther.\" When physically o r perso nally threatened: To Dr. T (who seems impaired, at least momentarily): \"Dr. T: \"Your languag e really bothers me. I need you to lower your voice and stop using vulgar language.\" Example: A co mplex into xicatio n. A group of residents and fellows became a ware that their attending appea red to have altered consciousness a nd mentation suggestive of intoxication or another acute organic brain syndrome. After brief questioning of their attending, they spoke quickly to each other, firmly took the senior clinician by the arms a nd brought him to the ER. In the ER he was discovered to be intoxicated with a psychoactive drug, and later diagnosed as having a chronic dementing disorder, previously unrecognized.Example: Getting help, and co mprehensive assessment and interventio n. You may need to obtain prompt assistance in assessing or intervening, and immediate help can usually be obtained f rom colleagues, senior residents or nurses present or nearby. The impera tive is to act -\u00ad with or without help. More comprehensive actions include ca lling on program directors, department chairs, dea ns for educa tion and/or members of clinicians' wellness committees or risk management departments. AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text)INTERACTION WITH RETURNING COLLEAGUES When a colleague returns to work, do not ignore your relationship. Initial interactions may f eel awkward, but \"be yourself ,\" express interest and show respect f or complex f eelings related to reentry. People with impairments may require absences from work to participate in treatment. Talking with someone who returns from hospitalization f or cholecystectomy may be easier tha n if the illness is prostate cancer or brea st cancer, with the very personal sexual and gender issues as well as the uncertainties a ttendant to cancer treatment. Even more problema tic are diagnoses such as depression, substance a buse, or neurologica l problems like stroke or multiple sclerosis. These ordinary, common a nd typically huma n dilemmas call upon you to communicate in a genuine way, on the one hand not being intrusive or asking too many questions, and on the other hand not ignoring obvious realities. B e welcoming in a manner consistent with your own and your colleague's emotional styles. It is natural to engage right away in clinical and work-\u00adrelated dialogue, because these conversations constitute the f oundation of collegial relationships. However, do not f ail to recognize that relationship and trust must be rebuilt on a revised foundation -\u00ad express interest in the person' s health and inquire about feelings regarding reentry to the work force. If your colleague wishes to speak about experiences while away, listen non-\u00ad judgmenta lly, and respond honestly and empathically. CONCLUSION Colleagues have both a n ethical and a collegial obliga tion to intercede. Patient safety is paramount. Many clinician impairments can be effectively mana ged. Numerous obstacles reta rd and limit the intention to enter dialog with potentially impaired colleagues. These include the \"culture of medicine,\" role ambiguity, power differences and hesita tion to initiate conversations with which we have little experience or pra ctice. Further, we can a nticipate the bilateral arousal of strong emotions and a threat to the continuation of a collegial relationship. However, these situations are part of the human condition and not exclusive to medicine. Nourish and sustain an attitude of commitment to the well-\u00adbeing of the colleague a nd that person' s patients. Take prompt a ction. Provide an accurate description of behaviors you have observed. Make explicit statements of respect, personal concern and partnership. Respond non-\u00adjudgmentally and no n-\u00addef ensively. If possible, review strategies for initiating conversa tions that might prove \"difficult.\" Seek timely consultation with trusted teammates such as senior clinicians, depa rtment heads and members of the administration, particularly when the danger to patients or your colleague appea rs imminent. BEHAVIOR CHECKLIST Initiate conversation even if cues and clues leave room for doubt a bout impairment Speak respectfully and non-\u00adjudgmentally Acknowledge the relationshipAcknowledge the dif ficulty of broaching this issue Express personal concern and state your personal position Describe your observations using behaviora l terms Seek a ssista nce if harm appears imminent for a patient or your colleague Welcome colleagues returning from treatment with honesty and respect REFERENCES 1.

What f ears do you have that may get in the way of offering eff ective feedback? 4. If a learner irritates you, how might tha t effect the feedback you offer? 5. After giving f eedback, what do you hope the learner will be thinking and f eeling? Key Principles: 1. effective feedback from fa culty and peers f acilitates improvement a nd learning2. a safe and eff ective culture of f eedback includes the f ollowing fea tures: agreement on learning goals consensus about expectations direct observation of behaviors considera tion of emotions checking learners' understanding and commitment to continued improvement invitation to reflect on potential personal and system resistance to utilization of feedback Learning go als: At the co nclusion o f this mo dule, yo u will be able to : Describe characteristics of a learning environment that facilitates and encourages feedback. Describe general f eedback principles. Describe the problems associated with giving eff ective feedback and how to overcome them. INTRODUCTION Specif ic elements in the environment of medical education fa cilitate the giving and receiving of constructive f eedback between faculty and learners. You can help to create a culture in which feedback signals are expected, valued and easily heard a bove the incessant ba ckground noise of clinic, classr oom and hospital. A large body of medical education literature attests to the importance of giving ef fective feedback. (1) Ende, in a seminal article on giving f eedback in the clinica l setting (2), emphasized that feedback should address changing behavior rather tha n changing the person exhibiting the behavior. Learners at all levels desire and apprecia te feedback. (3, 4, 5 ) For purposes of this mod ule, \"feedback\" is a strategy employed by teachers and coa ches to enhance the learning of their students or trainees. Feedback is directed towards improvement. On the other hand, \"positive reinf orcement\" is acknowledgement of behaviors that are at least satisfactory. Key elements of effective feedback include a focus on f uture performance, good intentions, accuracy, and timeliness. In an often hecti c environment, you can give better feedback and become more alert to feedback you receive if you attend carefully to maximizing how f eedback is heard (the signal) and minimizing background (noise). Creating a learning environment in which constructive f eedback promotes learners' willingness to try diff erent approa ches to problem-\u00adsolving, knowing that you will note errors a nd give advice for improvemen t. This module will focus on general f eedback principles, optimizing learning environments and emotions a bout feedba ck. GIVE FEEDBACK ABOUT OBSERVED BEHAVIORS Effective feedba ck focuses on improvement and addresses behaviors tha t ought to be changed. Optimally, the feedback derives f rom personal observation of behaviors a nd skills. Focus o n fut ure perfo rmance: Feedback is directed towards improvement. It involves formative assessment of a specif ic behavior and a plan that, if implemented by the learner, will result in a favorable outcome. Giving feedba ck effectively involves judgment and skill. Failure to give feedback conveys a number of possible messages, ranging from, \"No improvement is necessary,\" to lack of instructor interest, or even instructor inability to provide feedback. Observat ions, even-\u00adhandedness: Feedback is most ef fective when it is based both on persona l observation (insuring accura cy of assessment that prompted the feedback) and its relevance to the learner's goals. Learners are particularly appreciative of instructors and p eers who are even-\u00ad handed, i.e. giving f eedback when improvement is needed a nd acknowledging (positive reinforcement) actions done well. Commonly, you give feedback verbally or in writing, but you also convey f eedback by non-\u00adverbal cues such a s posture and facial expressions. ESTABLISH EXPECTATIONS Clarif y and agree on expectations so that learners know what they are to achieve, and give feedback in a timely way. Establish co nsensus as t o mutual expectatio ns: In an optimal learning environment you, as the instructor, will describe the behavior that you expect f rom learners and let them know that you will provide both formal and informal feedback. If you expect learners to demonstrate or master specific skills or tasks, outline them in deta il, using handouts and skills checklists with anchoring statements, so that learners will know what they must a chieve. Then, check that they understand your expectations. Formal f eedback is accomplished in scheduled sessions and meetings, so that learners can reflect on the feedback and act upon it before you make a final (summative) evaluation. Informal feedback, occasionally not thought of by learners as \"feedback\"(7) can occur anytime. Encourage learn ers to reflect on the feedback so tha t they can internalize it, process it, and make it part of their total learning experience. (8) Please click the video-\u00adbutt on on the left and watch the vignette \"You must f ix this -\u00ad NOW! \"Timeliness: Feedback is best given as near as possible to the observations you ma ke. Otherwise, both learner and instructor lose some relevant details, and learners are likely to be distra cted by intervening events, thus greatly reducing the value of the feedback. ADJUST FEEDBACK STRATEGIES Learners apprecia te feedback given straightforwardly, succinctly and objectively. Nuance your feedback by checking its impact, a nd consider learners' vulnerability about communica tion skills behaviors. Adjust t o situation and learner: Calibrate and deliver feedba ck with proper a ttention to the learning situation. In general, non-\u00ademergent issues should be dealt with in non-\u00ademergent terms. In most situations, f eedback requires no drama, since you are focusing on behaviors, not the person. Some learners need more information from their instructors and peers than others. Check with learners to establish the impact of f eedback, and do not deliver more than they can digest. Some learners are easily overwhelmed, particula rly if the feedback concerns a behavior that they already have been working to change, unsuccessfully. Keep your f eedback free of personal ref erences and deliver it in unemotional and objective terms. The art of giving feedback involves recognition that there are many ways of delivering feedback and the skillful instructor chooses the way most appropriate f or the learner and f or the occasion. Feedback abo ut communicatio n skills: Receiving f eedback about communica tion skills often puts learners in a more vulnerable state than in other learning situa tions. They've been communicating all their lives. Even well-\u00adintentioned and well-\u00adconstructed feedba ck delivered compassionately may be taken to mean \"you are not good enough\", or \"you should know better.\" In this latter situation, learners often feel personally attacked, criticized or ashamed that they cannot do a \"perfect\" interview or demonstration the first time. You can emphasize that you don't expect perfection and tha t getting feedback hastens the process of mastering skills and strategies f or use in unfamiliar, unanticipa ted and unsettling situations every clinician encounters while caring for patients and their families. OPTIMIZE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS Learners expect f eedback and value f aculty and peers who of fer appreciation of things well done a s well as suggestions for improvement. Establish culture o f feedback: In a study that examined the chara cteristics of faculty judged by learners a s skilled in giving feedba ck (6), the authors found that these skills included a willingness to consider the emotional response of learners, a n ability to resolve conflict, an interest in determining what the learner wanted to get out of the experience, a willingness to establish consensus as to mutual expectations, and a willingness to allow learners the time needed f or them to solve the problem on their own.Make feedback part of the learning culture. In this instance, all students expect suggestions f or improvement as well as acknowledgement of what was done well. In the latter instance, for example, comments f rom supervisors commending a student's performance need not be ef fusive. Often, a \"well done\", or a smile of approbation is a ll that it takes to make a learner's day. Self-\u00adassessment: When giving f eedback, a usef ul strategy is to ask learners to self-\u00ada ssess, and to inquire about what they think is an appropriate next step on the road to improvement. This helps you determine their level of insight a bout their ability a nd their comprehension of reasonable next steps. After learners' self-\u00adassessment, you can off er your own assessment a nd recommendations for future improvement. CONSIDER EMOTIONAL R ESPONSES Expect that you and your learners will sometimes be f eeling emba rrassed or inadequate, shy, overconfident, irritated, disinterested or unmotivated. Singly, in groups and with peers, include talk about feelings when such conversation will adva nce learning. Discuss with learners that your f eedback is meant to be helpful, formative, and designed to produce a positive summative evaluation. Remin d them that they are adequate as persons and as learners, but that developing a toolbox of effective skills is a challenging task that will continue throughout their professional careers. Practice is important to skill development, and some skills are inherently more complex or difficult and will require more practice than others. Inevitably some learners take f eedback personally, often feeling invali dated, or that they are not good enough. These feelings usually ref lect the learner's broader issues and feelings about themselves in rela tion to the course work or clerkship. It is an opportunity for you to respond with empathy, and perhaps to inquire in a nonjudgmental f ashion about what might be going on, and what is getting in the way of learning. Feedback in Gro ups Self-\u00adesteem may be even more f ragile in group settings. Do not make irrelevant positive comments to soften feedback. Another challenge involves giving f eedback to a learner in the presence of peers in such a way that you preserve the self-\u00adesteem of the f eedback recipient. As learners in the group notice that you attend thoughtfully to preserving the self-\u00adesteem of the f eedback-\u00adrecipient, the entire group is reassured that whoev er is next will not be embarrassed or worse when they are the recipients of feedback. Trying to soften the impact of feedback by prefacing it with irrelevant positive comments is of little value. Learners quickly begin flinching as soon as they hear a positive comment because they fear that the next comment will be about something they have done especially poorly. Feelings in tho se who give feedback Noticing and reflecting on the feelings associated with giving feedback improves teaching and learning. A willingness to give feedback involves taking risks, whether you are designated a \"faculty\" person or you a re a peer of the feedback recipient. These risks include being unpopular, becoming involved in a confronta tion, making incorrect or incomplete observations, working under time pressure and sometimes f ailing to explicitly acknowledge excellent progress or a ppreciate major deficits. Giving constructive f eedback when stressed or angry is difficult and the results uncertain. Unless there is a n immediate need, f eedback is best delayed until tempers have cooled. In some cases, it is advisable to deliver the feedback in writing rather than verbally. Document the facts and deliver your recommendation f or improvement as dispassionately as possible. Sometimes it will be helpful f or you to disclose and acknowledge with your learners your f eelings about your emotiona l responses to the stresses of giving feedba ck. Reflecting on both fa cts and feelings about the feedba ck aspects of your teaching activity with fa culty peers improves the quality of future feedback to learners. AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) ASSESS FEEDBACK EFFECTIVENESS Develop strategies for discovering the o verall effectiveness of your feedback activities. Perhaps one of the greatest challenges f acing faculty is f inding out whether the feedback received was helpful. One way is to ask the learner what he or she has taken awa y from the feedback, a nd what he or she will do dif ferently, and when. Another direct way is by observing improvement or conversely, its lack, in the learner' s behavior. Alternative ly, learner surveys or focus group sessions ma y yield information concerning the issues discussed in this module. These include the manner a nd timing of the feedback, the appropriateness of the feedback and recommendations for improvement and whether the feedback is given in a professiona l manner, i.e. free of bias, objective, positive and future-\u00adoriented. RESIDENTS ARE FACULTY The team' s supervising resident is in closer and more frequent contact with team members than any other faculty member Drexel University College of Medicine residents and faculty brainstormed and ref ined their perspectives on the role of Resident as Teacher. We present their lists of helpful Principles and key Strategies for improving the learning environment and the entire team' s learning opportunities. Resident Principles for Creating an Opt imal Learning Enviro nment Resident team leaders' effectiveness as teacher, supervisor, role model and advocate depends on their communication skills and attention to all team members' feelings.1. Golden rule: Treat your interns the way you would want to be treated! They are equal collea gues-\u00ad-\u00addo not look at them as subordinates, and remember, you were in their shoes only a short time ago. You and your interns are a team. If you can look at each other in that way, your patient care becomes more eff ective and eff icient. (Sometimes interns have done residencies in other countries and have considerable experience. B e open to learning from them.) 2. Residents have an o bligatio n to teach, both interns and medical students. Take time to consider how you can be an effective guide, a nd spend your extra time preparing to teach. Teaching can be both aca demic and practical. (Examples of practica l points: How to work with talkative patients, how to respond to family members' concerns, how to decrease patients' hospital stays, how to prioritize clinica l tasks, time management in general, the \"ins and outs\" of the system.) 3. Communicat ion is key. Keep the lines of communication open with your intern and students. If you are unhappy with how some things a re going, set aside time to explore the issues and \"clear the air,\" since resentments undermine team dynamics. Remember tha t you are an authority figure, so your interns ma y feel reluctant to bring up issues or be assertive about their needs. Encourage them to talk abou t how things are going f or them and what they need from you. 4. Perfect ion is the enemy o f the go od. You don't need to be perfect, or expect your interns to be perfect. Saying \"I don't know the answer to tha t, let's look it up\" or, \" I'm not comfortable ma naging this problem, let's get a consult\" can be reassuring to your team members and set a good example. 5. Provide po sitive energy! Your positive attitude and enthusiasm ma ke a real difference in the tea m. 6. You are a role mo del and a mento r for yo ur team. Your interactions with patients, colleagues and staff set an example of professional behavior. Also, you have been through a lot during your internship, and the lessons that you can pass on will help. You remember that internship is very stressf ul. Interns make mistakes. If you are supportive, positive and understanding, your attitude will reduce anxiety and help interns learn. 7. Monitor your own feelings and mo od. Leaders who are irritable and easily a nnoyed create a negative learning environment. If you are f eeling down, talk to a colleague or consider getting help. You cannot be eff ective with patients and your team if you don't take care of yourself . Also, be sensitive to your intern's emotional state. Up to 30% of house staff become burnt out or depressed and this may put the team off balance. If your intern is down, or dragging, gently inquire, a nd offer help. \"I notice that you seem (a little down; irritated; etc.); would you share a little about wha t is going on-\u00ad-\u00adI'd like to help?\" 8. Be an advo cate for your team. As team leader, at times you will need to protect your team members from inappropriate demands. Also, take responsibility for the team, and if for example, the attending asks about something that hasn't been done, don't blame the intern! 9. \"Think about what 's best fo r the patient , not about yourself, and yo u wo n't go wrong.\" (Edgar Sanchez) In a way, this seems like an obvious principle but sometimes it gets lost when a fellow or attending seems annoyed when you ca ll in the middle of the night. You or your intern might f eel intimidated to call because of a superior' s negative reputation, or you may not want to ask a question f or fear of being criticized or that others might think less of you. If you can keep the perspective that we' re here for the patients first of all, and the potential blows to our self -\u00adesteem are small when compared to the pa tients' needs for us to care for them, you'll do what is right.Resident Strat egies fo r Creating an Opt imal Learning Enviro nment Reach agreement with team members about expectations for sharing work, making time for learning, taking responsibility a nd the nature of teamwork. 1. Clarify goals and expectat ions at the beginning of every rotation with your team. Setting high expectations is usually helpful. Be clear on the details of everyone's roles, including your own. Tell interns to call you right away if a patient takes a turn f or the worse. Ta lk to interns about how to organize and prioritize their days. Ask them about their system and make suggestions to improve it. He lp interns understand the \"long view\" of the rotation, since interns tend to get ca ught up in the minutia of daily tasks and lose perspective on their general patient care and learning goals. Tell interns the rules about new admissions. (For example, when is it ok for triage to give you new admits, etc.) B e open to suggestions. Look at the first day as a team building exercise. Get to know each other. This sets the tone for the whole rotation. A sk your intern how they learn most eff ectively. What are their expectations and learning goals for this rotation? How can you help them achieve those goals? Do they learn best with a lot of guidance, or do they want to work independently and call you when they need you? Come up with an explicit a greement about how you will work together during the month. 2. Work as a group. If you share the work, there will be more time f or teaching, (and for much needed breaks). Consider setting goals as each day begins. Help interns manage their time and work more eff iciently\u2014at first, help interns prioritize tasks since everything seems important in the beginning. In the first months, ask the intern how many notes they can write by 10AM and call them at 10AM asking , \"who have you seen and wha t do you need me to do?\" At the end of the day, consider sitting down to go over what we all did today, and think about what the team will need to accomplish tomorrow. 3. Be available, a nd make sure your interns know you are available. Show up when needed. Don't tea ch over the phone. 4. As ro le mo del and mento r, follow these guidelines: Let interns kno w yo u suppo rt them, respond graciously to questions and invite them to ask whenever they are not sure of something. Your empathic leadership fosters their growth a nd enhances team effectiveness. Find things t hat are go ing right, and compliment your interns, in addition to looking for things tha t are wrong and correcting them for the future. Appreciate their accomplishments, both in patient care and learning. Never t alk in a disparaging manner about other house staff. Your gossip begets additional gossip a nd inevitably creates a negative tone. Also, gossiping contributes to creating fa lse impressions that could f ollow people for a long time. Are yo u making a po sitive cont ribut ion to the program? Your words and actions contribute to the general culture of learning in the residency. 5. Plan for mid-\u00adro tatio n info rmal feedback, and articulate what that feedback will cover. (This f eedback session will be something like going to coffee with your intern(s), asking them how things are going, are they accomplishing their stated goa ls, asking how can we do better, what could I as the resident do differently that will help the team, etc?) 6. You are respo nsible for the care of patients on your team. This mea ns that you should have a goal of seeing every patient every day! For the sicker patients, you need to spend time and make sure all bases are covered. For the less sick patients, you can spend less time. You should review all patients' labs every day.7. Set aside learning time, perhaps 15-\u00ad20 minutes in addition to attending rounds. Every day, pick something f rom your patient panel: a physical f inding, a feature of a patient's disease that you can explain more fully. At the beginning of the year, a good tea ching session would be \"common ca lls that an intern will get, and how to respond to them.\" (This session would also be good at the end of the year for the fourth year students.) 8. Organize a 20 minute t eam orientatio n with a Fellow f or specialty rotations, like at the beginning of MICU, CCU, or oncology rotations, . Make it a short overview of what is expected and perhaps create or locate handouts of essentials unique to that specialty - adjusting vent settings in MICU, interpretation of swan readings and how to make management adjustments based on these in the CCU, how to respond to a febrile neutropenic pa tient in oncology, etc. 9. Bring co ffee or make o ther simple gest ures o f suppo rt occasionally for your post call interns. Your encouragement and support are reassuring and help your interns maintain a positive attitude. 10. Attend to communicat ion with other patient care tea m members. You can explore many communication issues, like how to respond to \"suggestions\" from nursing staff without being confrontational. Listen to nurses and be respectful in talking with them. D on't get to the point of yelling at a nurse or collea gue. Work at being assertive and respectf ul at the same time. 11. When acting as resident for a sister team, help your post call intern. Be certain that each of you is f inished with your work bef ore you leave the hospital on weekends. CONCLUSION Providing feedback is both a skill and an a rt. It involves accura te assessment of an action or behavior that needs improvement a nd feedback that includes a plan which, if followed, will facilitate the learner's a bility t o achieve the desired goal. At the same time, learners receive and process feedback in different ways. The art of giving feedback involves knowing when a nd how to employ the most eff ective strategy to address the needs of individual learners. BEHAVIOR CHECKLIST 1. Reach a greement tha t feedback facilita tes improvement. (Establishes a feedback culture and creates a safe learning environment.) 2. Note that feelings of exposure and embarrassment a re norma l. 3. Establish agreement about what the \"correct\" behavior looks like. 4. Personally observe behaviors for which you provide feedback. 5. Invite self-\u00adassessment by learners. 6. Appreciate good work as you begin feedback. 7. Suggest improvements. 8. Check learner understanding of suggestions. 9. Check commitment to continue working to improve this skill. 10. Focus on behaviors (not personality or chara cter tra its or attributes). 11. Respond with empathy to verbal and non-\u00adverbal expressions of emotion. 12. Invite reflection about both instrumental and emotional obstacles to acceptance of feedback and commitment to improvement, both in the moment and outside the learning session. 13. Conduct inf ormal and formal evaluations of the ef fectiveness of feedback you give.

What elements distinguish a prof essiona l relationship f rom other human relationships such as friendship, family or that between colleagues or classmates? 2. In your professional relationships to date (as clinician or a s patient or as family member of a patient,) have you been aware of situations when the professiona l person responded in ways that did not seem appropriately \"professional\" (perhaps by beha ving in too social or friendly a manner, or perhaps by seeming too dista nt or abrupt)? How do these experiences inform your sense of \"professionalism\" ? 3. In a clinica l situation, what principles might be useful in deciding how to respond to gif ts youare offered from patients, or to a possible \"come-\u00adon\" f rom a patient, or to pa tients' questions about your personal life? 4. Have you encountered situations in which your professional boundaries became an issue? How did you decide what a ctions to take? 5. Personal issues play a role in clinician's behaviors in regard to professional bounda ries. How do the following issues apply to you? To what degree do you take responsibility for the happiness and well-\u00adbeing of your patients? Of your family and friends? To what degree are your interactions with patients meeting your own emotional needs? How comfortable are you in saying \"no\" to patient requests? Are you prone to \"rescue fantasies\" in your care of patients? Do you often take care of the needs of others before your own? What were the attitudes and behaviors about boundaries in your f amily of origin? Key Principles: 1. Boundary-\u00adchallenging interactions are those in which optima l professional action is unclear, often because the distinction between social and professional behavior is hazy. 2. Every clinicia n is confronted with boundary-\u00adchallenging situations such a s gift-\u00adgiving, self-\u00ad disclosure, physical touching, social invitations or social encounters with patients. 3. Problem-\u00adsolving requires clinicians to reflect on the value of altruism, consider patient and clinician motives, take into account inherent power differentials, seek consultation, and to err on the side of firm boundaries. 4. Communication about boundaries should convey respect f or patients' feelings as well a s acknowledge the complexity of the situation. Consider making statements about ethical and professional standards, statements that cla rify the professional nature of clinica l relationships and statements that indicate a need for additional time to consider the situation. Learning go als: At the co nclusion o f this module, yo u will be able to : Describe ' bounda ry-\u00adchallenging' situations that clinicians commonly encounter. In individual and group settings, reflect on appropriate boundary limits for clinicians in general and yourself personally. Describe strategies for deciding how to respond to commonly encountered boundary-\u00ad challenging situations.In boundary-\u00adchallenging situa tions, demonstrate ability to compassionately appeal to professiona l standards, state a general principle to which you a dhere, clarify the nature of the relationship, or postpone a decision. PROFESSIONALISM AND PROFESSIONAL BOUNDARIES The clinician-\u00adpatient relationship requires a special kind of intimacy. Caring and wa rmth must be shared within mutually understood professional bounda ries, and 'boundary challenges' arise regularly in clinical practice. Awareness of these challenges and responses to them that are simultaneously human and professiona l require mindfulness and practice. The introduction section of this module is outlined as f ollows: Intimacy and professionalism; concepts of boundaries and limits Social and professiona l behavior norms; discernment and \"alarms\" Responding to alarm signals; principles f or exa mining and resolving challenges Communicating: st rategies f or responding to bounda ry challenges Communicating; skills f or responding to bounda ry challenges INTIMACY AND PROFESSIONALISM Healing relationships involve trust, esteem, love and caring, which must be bounded by professiona l commitment to accountability, altruism, respect, confidentiality and self-\u00adcare In this module, we explore the bounda ries of a particular form of human relationship - the doctor-\u00ad patient relationship. This relations hip is often an intimate one, in which trusting patients confide their most personal issues as well a s their f ears, hopes and dreams. Patients often esteem and love their clinicia ns, and we in turn often admire, care for, and even love our patients. This intimacy and caring ca n be healing elements of our relationships with patients, but only when they occur within mutually understood prof essional bo undaries. The idea of professional bounda ries is informed by the concept of professionalism, which encompasses a commitment to altruism, confidentiality, accountability, excellence, respect, compassion, self-\u00admonitoring a nd self-\u00adcare. The study of professional boundaries is concerned with beha viors at the limits of a clea rly defined notion of professionalism. Any beginning medica l student knows that it is unprofessiona l for a clinician to come to work intoxicated, to have sexua l relations with a patient, or to prescribe narcotics to a neighbor. You might also easily identify certain examples of professional behavior; such as, a clinician who apologizes for and tries to rectify a mista ke, or refuses to share patient information with her spouse. Where do you draw the boundary line? Clinicians must recognize and resolve ambiguous, uncomfortable and potentially exploitative situations involving gif t-\u00adgiving, attraction, self-\u00addisclosure and social relationships. When we exclude situations that are clearly inside or outside of the bounded concept of professionalism, we notice that ambiguous boundary area s remain. Situations shaded in graymight include the f ollowing: Is it ok to accept a gift f rom a patient? Is it appropria te to reveal persona l information to a patient? What should I do if I know a patient f rom another context? What if I find myself feeling attracted to a patient? May I keep in touch with a patient who is no longer in my practice? Such situations are poised at the top of a \"slippery slope\" in which the patient or provider are at risk for sliding into an uncomfortable and potentially exploitative situation. Successful negotiation of these and related professional boundary challenges is essential for the development of a trusting and eff ective relationship betwee n clinician and patient, and ultimately a successful a nd satisfying career in medicine. SOCIAL AND PROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOR NORMS Understand the distinctions between the social norms that govern personal relationships and those that apply to professional relationships. Professional boundaries might also be thought of as the social norms that govern the clinicia n-\u00ad patient relationship. Ideally, social nor ms serve to maintain order, saf ety and productivity in human relationships and communities. Think of the social norms you learned growing up. You probably learned not to look at naked people, and certainly not to touch people's private parts unless you were involved in a n intimate relationship. You lea rned not to play with or even discuss body f luids. You learned not to ask people very persona l questions a bout themselves. These ingrained social norms no longer hold in the clinician-\u00adpatient relationship, as the new medical trainee breaks one \"taboo\" af ter another. This process can be unsettling and confusing to the medical trainee a nd even the advanced practitioner (1) . Students must learn to internalize a new set of social norms, ca lled \"professional bounda ries\". Furthermore, the clinician must be clear on the distinctions between the behaviora l norms tha t apply to one's personal or social relationships, and those that a pply to one's professional rela tionships, and be able to manage the complexity inherent in \"dual-\u00adrelationships.\" Harper G. Breaking taboos and s teadying the self in medical school. Lancet. 1993;342:913-\u00ad915. Discerning bo undaries There a re no clear-\u00adcut \"rules of conduct\" f or common bounda ry challenging situations. We offer guidelines and principles to help problem solve and negotiate boundary challenges. The development of healthy and eff ective professional bounda ries is fostered by opportunities for mentorship, problem solving, a nd practice with language. Memorizing \"rules of conduct\" is rarely helpful in learning to negotia te common boundary challenges. This module states some general principles applica ble to the infinite variety of challenges every clinician encounters. The movies in this module depict commonly encountered situations conta ining a \"boundary dilemma\". They offer rich opportunities for reflection, case explora tion, problem solving and role play. These clips depict clinicians early in their training, but the lessons and principles are a pplicable for every level of medical training and experience. Apply the module's general principles and practice the suggested communication strategies a nd language, a nd begin building a repertoire of effective solutions tha twill work f or you. Tune into your Bo undary Alarm Certain situations, such a s strong emotional reactions to a patient, gifts, or persona l questions should trigger an internal \"alarm\" to warn you of a possible boundary challenge. In negotiating boundaries in clinical pra ctice, you might find the \"boundary alarm\" framework a useful conceptual guide (2) . The phrase \"my bounda ry alarm is constantly going off! \" was coined by a medical student struggling with issues of self-\u00addisclosure and social interactions with patients. Like a home security system, a boundary alarm is intended to preserve safety, well-\u00adbeing and integrity. It must be set to ring at the correct threshold -\u00ad a setting that is too low produces cold and distant relationships; too high a setting may result in unprofessiona l behavior and unsafe outcomes. Your alarm should ring and increase your vigilance about bounda ry issues whenever you encounter personal questions, gif ts, hugs, social invitations, chance encounters or business dealings with patients. Further, emotional reactions to pa tients, such as a strong like or dislike for a patient, or the feeling that you are saying or doing things around a particular patient that you wouldn' t norma lly say or do are part of our norma l human responses to other people, but in the professional setting should def initely set off your boundary a larm. Psychiatrists ref er to these emotional responses as counter-\u00adtra nsference feelings, acknowledge their power, and assure us that vigilance is especially importa nt in these situations. Each movie in this module depicts a situation that should trigger your boundary a larm. Your thoughtful responses to the alarm signals are often as important to your patients' health as any other diagnostic or treatment actions you take on their beha lf. Gaufberg E. Alarm and Altruism: Professional boundaries and the medical student. Clinical Teacher 3;2006:206-\u00ad209. RESPOND TO BOUNDARY ALARM SIGNALS: PRINCIPLES In thi s section, we present 6 problem solving principles that can help when you encounter a bounda ry challenging situation. Internalizing these principles can help you decide wha t to do and what to say when your boundary alarm rings Operationalize altruism. Understand patient motives and needs. Understand your own motives and needs. Remember the power differential. Call on collea gues. Err towards more bounda ries, rather than fewer. Operatio nalize alt ruism Always consider wha t actions a nd words would best benef it the patient. Altruism is a fundamental distinguishing feature of a prof essiona l relationship. Operationalizing altruism involves discerning how to place the needs and interests of the patient bef ore your personal needs. Take the time to ask yourself these questions: \"What action would be in the best interest of this patient?\" and, \"What action has the highest likelihood of assuring a successful ongoing professi onal relationship with this patient?\" Consider what course of action and what words would benef it the patient in the short-\u00adrun and what might allow the rela tionship to thrive in the longer-\u00adterm future. Understand pat ient motives and needs Discovery of effective resolution to a boundary dilemma requires a n understanding of the patient's motive and purpose. For example, with gif t-\u00adgiving or social invita tions, ask yourself: \"What does the gift or invitation mean to the patient?\" \"What is the patient trying to communicate with this gift?\" Let your a nswer help guide your solution. It is important to try to understand the mea ning of the gesture, and to respond a ppropriately to it, if the relationship is to retain the proper focus on patient well-\u00adbeing. Usually the best way to understand a patient's motiv e is to ask the patient. You may have some hunches or assumptions about the meaning, but checking with the patient shows your respect f or subtlety, your concern about trust and dignity, and your interest in putting your patient's well-\u00adbeing first. Understand yo ur own mo tives and needs Discovery of effective resolution to a boundary dilemma depends on your a ttempt to understand your own emotions, needs and reactions. Try to identify what persona l and professional issues a given \"boundary challenge\" raises for you. Pay attention to your own emotional reactions. Ask yourself : \"Am I identifying with a particular patient?\" \"Do I f ind myself disliking a particular patient?\" \"Are there potential conflicts of interest in my interactions with this particular patient?\" \"How does this make me feel regarding this patient and my medical practice?\" The clinician should be especia lly aware of how his or her own needs such as the perfectly normal needs for certainty, af fection, intimacy, or conf lict avoidance may shif t the focus of the encounter away f rom caring f or a patient's illness or health concerns. Pause and consider whether certain possible responses actually serve your personal needs rather than advancing your professional relationship with this patient.Remember the po wer different ial Power differentials are unavoidable. Ignoring these dif ferences leaves patients and clinicians vulnerable to unconscious attempts to take power or give it up. Take into account the power diff erential in your relationships with patients, and recall that this factor always affects expectations and interpersonal interactions. Whether consciously or not, patients perceive care providers as quite powerf ul. Medical tra inees ma y not realize how pa tients perceive this issue or how strongly patients respond to it because of the trainee's relatively low status in the medical hierarchy. Sea soned clinicians often discount the extent to which the power differentials and the patient or clinician' s unconscious attempts to cope with them may lead down slippery slopes toward invitations, gift-\u00adgiving and so on. Call o n colleagues Gain important perspective and new ideas, and also assist your colleagues' growth by calling them into conversation a nd seeking advice. Bringing underlying issues and emotions to light and discovering sensible solutions is always easier when we enlist help from someone not directly involved or affected by the situa tion. Obtain supervision from a trust ed colleague or call on a mentor f or consulta tion when presented with a bounda ry challenge. you encountered experiences like mine?\" \"With the advantag e of hindsight, what are your thoughts now a bout it?\" \"What if you were in my shoes, what would you think a nd do?\" Further, because bounda ry issues are so common and puzzling, your request is also likely to improve the collea gue's awareness and understanding of future issues that he or she will confront. Err to wards mo re boundaries, rather than fewer When uncertain, always take actions that you a nticipate will provide saf ety and increase trust, even though you ma y feel more distance in the relationship than you'd like. Remember tha t relaxing a more rigid bounda ry is easier tha n back-\u00adpedaling up a slippery slope! Once a safe, trusting relat ionship is f irmly established and bounda ry challenges clarified, you can always adjust the limits of the rela tionship. COMMUNICATION WHEN CHALLENGES ARISE: STRATEGIES When the boundary alarm rings, experienced clinicians have a repertoire of effective types of responses to call upon while they seek to better understood the nature of the issue. Use the following communication strategies when you encoun ter a boundary challenge:Appeal to medical ethics or prof essiona l standards. Appeal to general principles. Reiterate the nature of the relationship. Take the time you need to consider an issue. Appeal to medical ethics o r pro fessional standards Advise patients that you structure relationships in accordance with professiona l guidelines from groups to whom you are accountable. Patients are helped by hearing you speak about professional standards and guidelines for maintaining professional relationships. Let them see that you understand your clini cal relationships to be prof essional ones, with boundaries that you will honor. \"I'm sorry, it' s against the Board of Registration Guidelines f or me to write a prescription for someone who is not my patient\" or, \"It's not considered a medica lly ethica l practice to ____\" Appeal to general principles Let patients know that you'll rela te to them according to the same norms and principles that you guide you r interactions with all your other patients. Help your patient see that your actions about an issue are general principles by which you operate rather than specia l actions taken beca use the patient is special in some way\u2014tha t is, \"It's not personal.\" You might say something like the f ollowing: \"I have a rule\" or, \"My practice/view/belief is ____, so this action (or these words) is what I do (or sa y) whenever this comes up with a patient.\" Reiterat e the nature of the relatio nship Remind pa tients of your a wareness that prof essional relationships have particular limits and structures. Remind pa tients of your a wareness of the professional nature of your relationship. You could say: \"Sometimes it can be complicated f or a caregiver to interact with a patient outside of the medical setting. In that situation, it mig ht color my judgment a bout what's best f or you medically, or could interfere with your willingness to disclose uncomf ortable experiences ...\" or, \"As a medical student working with your primary ca re clinicia n, I'll need to defer to her on that issue.\" Take t he time you need to consider an issue Reassure patients tha t your relationship with them is important enough to require special considera tion. The clearer you can be about your concern about keeping rela tionships properly oriented, the more cared f or your patients will feel. Show how important a prof essional approach is by asking directly for time to reflect on the issue. Simple and direct statements a re helpful. Consider saying the following: \"I'll need to think about that\" or, \"I'll need to consult my preceptor on ___\" COMMUNICATION WHEN CHALLENGES ARISE: TACTICS AND SKILLS Each of the following text sections presents a specific common, predictable and recurrent dilemma, and is associated with a movie clip. In turn, go to each text section, view the film and ref lect on possible answers to the questions. Think about what the clinicia n or student should say or do in the particular scenario. The texts and movies present the following dilemmas: Self-\u00adDisclo sure Clinician self -\u00addisclosure may contribute to establishing a healthy partnership with a patient, but always consider whether or not your personal disclosure will benefit the patient. Gift-\u00adGiving Gifts may powerf ully af fect the giver and the receiver. D o not accept gifts unless examination of purpose and potential ef fect shows that their accepta nce is in the best interest of the relationship. Social Invitat ions fro m Patients Every professional interaction has a social component a nd satisfies normal needs for human connection. The decision to socialize with a patient requires that you first clarify the limits and nature of a 'dual relationship.' Clinician-\u00adPatient Touch Clinician-\u00adinitiated touch should be limited to sanctioned physical examination techniques and simple comf orting gestures. Clinician self-\u00addisclo sure Clinician self -\u00addisclosure has pros a nd cons. It may contribute to establishing a healthy partnership with a patient, but always carries risks. Self -\u00addisclosure that seeks f riendship, caring, sympathy or intimacy from a patient is a bounda ry violation. On-\u00adli ne self-\u00addisclosure is problema tic these days, whether directed to a patient or other sites. (3,4,5)Please click the video-\u00adbutt on on the left and watch the vignette \"What about you, Doc?\" The vignette \"What a bout you, D oc?\" stimulates at least the following questions: 1. How did the clinician end up in this situation? 2. What are some possible advantages and disadva ntages of clinician self-\u00addisclosure in the doctor-\u00adpa tient How would you respond? Please click the video-\u00adbutt ons below and wa tch 4 different ways how to respond: The guiding principle in deciding whether to self-\u00addisclose is altruism. To put altruism to the test, ask yourself: \"Is self-\u00addisclosure in this patient's best interest? Will disclosure strengthen the professional relationship?\" Self-\u00addisclosure is problematic if it is automatic, gratuitous or done in an a ttempt (however unconscious) to seek ca re or sympa thy from the patient. Also, a patient may perceive disclosure of personal information as an off ering of friendship or mutual interpersonal intimacy which the clinician does not intend. Self-\u00addisclosure risks heading down a \"slippery slope\" from which backpedaling is difficult. Possible advantages of self-\u00addisclosure include establishment of rapport, a nd perhaps minimizing the inherent power-\u00addif ferential in the doctor-\u00adpa tient relationship. Some evidence suggests that clinician self -\u00addisclosure around personal behavior can motivate patients to adopt better health habits, specif ically diet a nd exercise . Writers disa gree on the appropriate depth and content of clinician self-\u00addisclosure. B each notes the complexity of self-\u00addisclosure communication, and declares that a mindful awareness should balance spontaneity. If you notice that you are spontaneously ta lking about yourself to a patient, you should explore your own motiva tions. Are you bored? Is this an attempt to get the patient to like, a dmire or take care of you? The primary goa l should be to ma intain the f ocus of the interview on the patient and his or her wellbeing. If a patient a sks you a personal question, consider why this particular question has arisen at this point in time. Is it an attempt to \"make friends,\" simple curiosity or an attempt to seek reassura nce? Sometimes patients a re interested in how your experience might relate to their own issues. For example, patients who have problems with their teens may ask if you have had teenage children. Your own similar experiences might in fact help you to understand and empathize with theirsituation, but you must still weigh the potential impact of such a revelation. Whether or not you disclose in response to a patient's question, your words should redirect the interview to the patient. Language such a s \"I'm really interested in your experience with .....\" can refocus the interview a nd lower the likelihood that the patient will f eel rejected in the conversation. Self-\u00adDisclo sure and On-\u00adLine So cial Networking On-\u00adline social networking poses additional challenges to mainta ining safe and effective professional bounda ries. Social networking sites such as Facebook are specifically designed for disclosure of personal information, including videos, photos and descriptions of activities and feelings. Such information may be easily disseminated despite thoughtful privacy settings. On-\u00adline social interactions between clinicia ns and patients are high-\u00adrisk interactions, a nd promote unintentional self-\u00addisclosure as well as widespread dissemination of private information. Guseh and Brendel suggest the following guidelines (paraphrased) for use of social networking sites: Do not initiate an invitation to a patient to become an on-\u00adline friend, and think carefully bef ore accepting a patient's friend request. The clinicia n should consider engaging in a face to face discussion with the patient about the potential implications and/or risks of an on-\u00adline 'friendship' , or might consider seeking an ethics consultation prior to accepting a patient's friend request. Do not enter into the medical record any information obtained on-\u00adline, unless the patient explicitly agrees. Medical trainees and clinicians must exercise judgment and restraint prior to disclosing personal information on the internet. Content, tone and professional decorum should be carefully considered. Understand the privacy settings of any on-\u00adline socia l networking sites, and use conservative settings. Keep in mind that privacy technology is imperf ect. Gift-\u00adgiving Gifts may powerf ully af fect the giver a nd the receiver. D o not accept gifts unless examination of purpose and potential ef fect shows that their acceptance is in the best interest of the relationship. (6,7,8) Please click the video-\u00adbutt on on the left and watch the vignette \"Thank You!\" The vignette \"Thank You! \" stimulates at least the following questions: 1. What motivates the patient's daughter to give the gift? 2. What else might motiva te a patient to give a gift? 3. What are the pros and cons of a ccepting a gift (in this case, and in general)? 4. What should the student do and say? Please click the video-\u00adbutt on on the left and watch a discussion about these issues. Whenever you receive a gift from a patient, ask yourself: \"What does this gift mean to the patient?\" A small token of gra titude might be accepted with a simple \"thank you\". A presumed attempt to bribe or manipulate should be refused by the clinician, yet one must still choose words a nd tone of voice that convey that th e refusal is in the best interest of the doctor-\u00adpatient relationship. The refusal of a small gif t may seem petty, but at what point does a \"small gift\" cease to be small? What if the gift is somehow too intimate? Or wha t if it is cash? What about those patients in whose country of origin gift-\u00adgiving is the only means to ensure quality care? The clinician should consider how the gift might a ffect his or her ability to care for the patient in a fair and objective manner. Ask yourself: If I accept this gift, will I feel obligated to spend more time a nd effort on this patient than I would otherwise? When refusing a gift, express apprecia tion for the gesture of giving. Possible language could be the following: \"I apprecia te your thoughtfulness, but I have a general rule not to accept gifts from patients. The best gift to me is to know that you're satisfied with the care I've provided.\" Or \"Wow, this is a beautiful vase, but I' m afraid I can' t accept it. It's an ethical issue for me - and I don't want my other patients to f eel obligated to give me gifts.\" Or consider accepting a gift on behalf of a team: \"This fruit basket is beautiful; our office staff will be so appreciative.\"Or suggest a donation to a cha rity: \"I noticed you included $50 in your Christmas ca rd to me, but really, the sentiments in the card were a ll I needed. I can't a ccept the money personally, but would be happy to donate it to ___ charity\" Please click the video-\u00adbutt on on the left and watch Dr. Gaufberg commenting on these issues. The American College of Clinicians (ACP) position paper, the Ethics Manual, states, \"A small gift to a clinician as a token of appreciation is not ethically problematic.\" They note consideration should be given to the nature of the gift, the potential implications for the patient-\u00adclinician relationship, and the patient's probable motivation and expectation. Individual institutions differ on their rules regarding accepting gifts from patients, but the most important rule of thumb is to consider how acceptance or refusal of the gift will ultimately aff ect the clinician-\u00adpatient relationship. As with all \"boundary challenges\", discussion with a mentor or supervisor helps clinicia ns achieve perspective and resolv e issues in a satisfa ctory manner.. Spence suggests that clinicians keep a record of all gifts offered or received, and discuss the issue openly with colleagues in order to promote transparency.(8) Social invitat ions fro m patients Every professional interaction has a social component a nd satisfies normal needs for human connection. The decision to socialize with a patient requires that you first clarify the limits and nature of a 'dual rela tionship.' Please click the video-\u00adbutt on on the left and watch the \"The Dancer\" vignette. The \"dancer vignette\" stimulates at least the following questions: 1. Is it ever acceptable to accept a patient's social invitation, or extend one to a patient? 2. What are the pros and cons to socializing with patients outside of the medical setting?3. What questions might this clinician ask in deciding whether to attend the performance? 4. If the genders of clinician and patient were reversed, would this affect your response to the scenario? 5. What if the clinica l setting were dif ferent (e.g. ER, Primary Care, Psychiatry)? 6. What if the clinician were providing on-\u00adgoing care to the patient? 7. What should the clinician do and say in this scenario? Please click the 5 video-\u00adbut tons in t his table and watch thedifferent ways how this could develop: A decision whether to enter into a social relationship with a patient is complex and dependent on several varia bles. What are the norms about social interactions based on location (rural vs. urban) and setting (psychiatry vs. primary care vs. specialty f ields)? Will the clinicia n be able to remain objective and to maintain patient conf identiality? Does the patient wish to initiate a friendship, or a romantic relationship, or does the patient hope f or special treatment from the clinician? What are your own f eelings toward this patient-\u00ad-\u00ad a sexual or romantic interest should immediately trigger your \"boundary alarm! \" How might socializing with a patient aff ect other patients who may learn of the social interaction? Remember the inherent power differential and how that will inevitably have some ef fect on any personal relationship with a patient. Please click the video-\u00adbutt on on the left and watch Dr. Gaufberg commenting on these issues. If you decide to socialize, acknowledge that you have both a personal and a medical relationship, in f act a 'dual-\u00adrelationship'. The clinician should initiate a conversation that results in clear definition of the nature and limits of the relationship. For example: can the \"friend\" now call the clinician at hom e about medical issues? If there is any interest in an intimate relationship, the professional relationship must be termina ted.Clinician-\u00adpatient touch Clinician-\u00adinitiated touch should be limited to sanctioned physical examination techniques and simple comforting gestures. Explain potentially misconstrued contact in advance, respond graciously to patient-\u00adinitiated touch, and set clear limits whenever you are concerned about the meaning of a physical gesture. Please click the video-\u00adbutt on on the left and watch the \"The Hug \" vignette. \"The Hug\" vignette leads to the f ollowing questions: 1. What motivates the patient to give the doctor a hug? 2. What should the clinician do and say in this situation? Please click the video-\u00adbutt on on the left and watch a comment by the clinicia n.. Many factors determine how individuals f eel about hugs and other forms of touch, as each of us is inf luenced by cultural, social and family norms. Medical training and role modeling f urther influence clinicia ns. Touch may be initiated by either the clinician or the patient, who will differ in their understanding of the mea ning of touch a nd their comfort level with various f orms of touch. Additionally, clinicians break a normative social ta boo during physical exams, touching patients in intimate places. Touch is sanctioned in this particular rela tionship, but the physical exam always includes close a ttention to the patient's privacy and comfort, through use of drapes and chaperones. The clinician must a scertain that pat ients are aware of the rationale for any clinician-\u00adinitiated touch. Pref ace any physical conta ct tha t might be misconstrued, such as a pelvic exam in the work-\u00adup of abdominal pain and fever in a sexually active woman, with a n explanation of the rationale f or the exam. Clinicians have other reasons to touch patients, such a s providing comf ort, communicating warmth or validation, or signaling dominance. The clinician must only initiate physical contact that is intended to meet a presumed therapeutic need of the patient. It is sa fer to refrain from demonstrative touch such as a hug, especially if you do not know the patient very well. To convey the same sentiment as a hug, choosewords that express the f eeling, or consider a gentle touch on the patient's hand or arm. It is normal to occasionally feel a ttracted to a patient. If you find yourself sexually attracted to a patient, you must not only avoid any physical demonstrations of affection, but also avoid being overly friendly in your words a nd manner. If your feelings of attraction continue in a n ongoing relationship, discuss this with a colleague or mentor. Patients may initiate touch with clinicians for a variety of reasons, such a s communicating warmth or appreciation, displaying relief, seeking approval, dependence, or a closer relationship with the clinician, or transmitting sexual desire or interest. Consider the intent behind patient-\u00adinitiated touch. If uncomfortable for any reason, you can set limits in a respectful manner. Possible approaches to limit setting include acknowledgment of the gesture of t he hug, and an of fer or modeling of a different means of expression. You might use body language to model preferred behavior (an outstretched hand for a handshake in a nticipation of a hug). (9) Other strategies that help to set limits include the following: Openly name the issue, a nd cite persona l or cultural differences. \"You seem to be someone who expresses feelings with hugs. Our nurse manager is the same way. That's great -\u00ad-\u00ad but I'm more of a hearty-\u00ad handsha ke type.\" Or, \"Wow, you really surprised me with that hug. In Asian culture, we pretty much limit our hugs to immediate f amily - a handshake or a high-\u00adf ive would work better f or me! I'm really hap py that you' re relieved that everything's ok.\" Set a general rule or cite professional standards: \"I'm glad you' re so plea sed with the lab results, a nd I should let you know that I have a genera l rule not to hug my patients -in today's social climate we clinicia ns are discoura ged from hugging.\" Accompany such statements with the offer of a handshake or a warm smile.

Discussion about Boundary Issues Elizabeth Gauberg, M.D., MPH a nd Dennis No vack, M.D., are having a discussio n abo ut bo undary issues CONCLUSION Mutual caring between clinician and pa tient only thrives within the mutually understood bounda ries of a professional rela tionship. Clinician-\u00adpa tient relationships a re therapeutic in themselves. Mutual caring between clinician and pa tient promotes and augments trust, saf ety, confidence and hope. This caring is an essential a spect of therapeutic a nd healing relationships, and it can only thrive within the mutually understood boundaries of a professional rela tionship. Occasionally, unexamined feelings or misinterpreted communications by patient or clinician lead to incursions beyond those bounda ries, and such incursions always threaten the relationship. Principles to address boundary issues include operationalizing altruism , seeking to understand the patient's a nd your own motives a nd needs, being vigilant about the power diff erential inherent in clinician-\u00adpatient relationships, and consulting with colleagues or mentors when a problem arises. If unsure of the most effective response in a moment, it is safer to err or the side of firmer bounda ries.References 1. Harper G. Breaking taboos and stea dying the self in medical school.

Much of what we know we have lea rned f rom the examples and teachings of our parents, teachers, siblings and friends. When we experience the pleasures of learning, it encourages us to pass along what we have learned to others. Along the way we also learn that teaching is, in ma ny ways, its own reward. Many of us have experienced the gratification of teaching something important to a friend or colleague that makes a difference in their lives. Teaching can be exciting and stimulating when it is going well, connecting us to what we value in our work. Teaching is core to a doctor' s role. In fact, the origin of the word \"doctor\" comes from the Latin, \"docere,\" meaning \"to teach.\" We teach p atients a bout their disea ses and how to care for themselves. If we use ef fective teaching techniques patient understanding, adherence, and outcomes improve. We teach junior colleagues, who then deliver better patient care. Indeed, as we progress in medical education, we are expected to teach, and in preparing for teaching sessions, we often learn new material that helps us as much as the learners. I t has been estimated that house staff spend 20% of their time teaching. Even these inexperienced teachers impact learners by their role modeling. All clinical teachers must remain cognizant of the impact that their behaviors and attitudes ha ve on learners. We can enhance our effectiveness as teachers and role models by developing certain a ttitudes, knowledge, skills and self-\u00adreflection. One core goal of clinical teaching focuses on the process of enhancing learners' clinical reasoning. That's the process of creating a problem synthesis (or one sentence descriptive title), generating hypotheses tha t are tested through f ocused data gathering with continuous reassessment of differential diagnoses, establishing the most likely diagnosis (and identifying any must not miss diagnosis), then creating an e valuation strategy to refute or confirm the diagnosis. Exposing every component of the clinical reasoning process is a goal of clinical teaching, in order to identify gaps, correct errors, and promote better refinement of reasoningIf one of the end products of a ll clinical teaching is to enhance learners' clinical reasoning, still we do much more than that in our teaching. Through our manner with learners and patients we model professiona lism, including respect, kindness, attention to learners' a nd patients' worries a nd suffering, and using our abilities to not only diagnose and cure, but to understand and promote healing. The best teachers inspire, and pa ss along their wisdom and art to contribute and to leave something behind - to enhance the lives of current and future patients, families, and communities. HOW ATTITUDES AFFECT TEACHING Attitudes sha pe behaviors. Positive attitudes about teaching a nd about your learners enhance your effectiveness as a teacher. Attitudes that enhance your teaching include enthusiasm for tea ching (1) and pa tient care, respect f or your peers and junior colleagues (2), caring about your learners as people, and concern f or their educational needs and for their persona l and professional growth. If you believe that your students are basically well-\u00adintentioned and trying to do their best, you are more likely to be generous with your pra ise for their efforts, forgiving of small mistakes a nd supportive of their stretching their limits. If you believe that your students are lazy and trying to get away with doing as little as possible, don' t really care much for what you are teaching, aren't as dedicated a s you and your colleagues were, or are not striving for the high standards tha t are your ideal, you ma y only see their f aults, be stingy with your praise, and generous with your criticism. Positive and nega tive experiences with teachers help shape our attitudes. For example, some f aculty members learned through being \"pimped\" and humiliated in front of their peers (3), a nd came to believe tha t this is an effective way to tea ch. For most, humiliation inhibits learning. Moods and aff ective states affect our attitudes. If you are feeling resentful, a ngry about your personal or professiona l situation, unfa irly treated by your seniors, not good enough or smart enough, or feelin g envious or angry towards certa in junior collea gues on your team, these negative emotions will surely inhibit your a bility to be an ef fective teacher. A number of faculty members and house staff are burned out or depressed, causing them to have negative attitudes a nd to be irritable with others. (4) On the other hand, if you are feeling confident, secure in your knowledge and abilities, and can provid e positive energy to your rounds and teaching sessions, these emotions will be infectious a nd contribute to a positive learning environment. It can be worthwhile to ponder and discuss these questions: What are your basic attitudes a bout yourself and towards your peers and junior colleagues? How confident are you in your sense of yourself as someone who can contribute to others and be a role model to junior colleagues? What do you value about being a teacher? How might your emotiona l state and your attitudes be enhancing or inhibiting your a bility to be an effective teacher? The first step towards improving your ef fectiveness as a teacher involves self-\u00ad reflection. Your abilities to teach improve as you grow personally through enhanced self-\u00adreflection and self-\u00adawareness. It can be helpful to discuss your doubts, f ears, concerns and insights with trusted colleagues and friends as a way of promoting your personal growth, as a person a nd as a teacher. Much has been written in recent years about attending to and improving self-\u00adawareness in medical education. Novack, Epstein and their colleagues summarized the issues related to enhancing self -\u00adawareness a nd reflection in medical education and care. (5, 6) Finally, it is worth emphasizing the point about caring f or your learners. Peabody (7) f amously sa id that the secret in the care of the patient is in caring for your patient. The same can be sa id for teaching. If you respect, honor, and care f or your learners as individua ls, they will know that,forgive small mistakes, and wa nt to learn all the more. GUIDELINES FOR EFFECTIVE CLINICAL TEACHING Effective clinical teachers understand and employ diverse educational strategies in order to engage a nd stimulate the intrinsic motivation of their learners. Novack and colleagues summarized educational principles relevant to teaching medical interviewing (8). In the following section, we describe 10 guidelines that apply to teaching in clinical medical settings. 1. Define go als and o bjectives and reach agreement wit h learners 2. Assess and address learners' knowledge and mo tivatio n 3. Teach knowledge and skills sequentially fro m simple to complex 4. When yo u teach skills, define them and present t hem as discrete behaviors 5. Enhance learning of kno wledge and skills thro ugh repetitio n and reinfo rcement 6. Provide effective feedback 7. Ensure early success 8. Monitor and attend to learners' emo tions 9. Provide o pportunities fo r interactio n, quest ions, and reflectio n 10. Provide formative and summat ive evaluat ions 1. Define goals and o bjectives and reach agreement with learners Discussion and development of sha red goals and objectives at the beginning of rotations as well as the beginning of individua l sessions enhances a ll learning activities. The maxim that if you don't know where you're going it' s unlikely you will get there, and you surely will not know if you h ave a rrived, applies to clinica l teaching a ctivity. Learners and faculty who share expectations prepare better, stimulate and enga ge with each other' s needs and can measure progress. In discussion, both learners and teachers may wish to modif y objectives or a dd new ones, according to their learning needs. Interns and residents will learn more in a rotation if they sit down on the first day and agree upon goals, responsibilities, expectations, and what they hope to learn and teach during the rotation. Even when beginning a session to teach a discrete topic, it is helpful to outline the main goals of the session, seek agreement and with your learners, a nd give them a chance to add other related goals.Please click the video-\u00adbutt on on the left and watch how a senior resident orients his team members on the first day of a new service. 2. Assess and address learners' kno wledge and motivatio n As a rotation or session begins, assess learners' knowledge, perspectives and feelings, so that you can a ddress misconceptions and fine tune your teaching strategies. Address learners' motivation about a session or r otation to maximize their learning. When learners think they fully understand the topic you are working on, they are unlikely to pay close attention. Some learners may have preconceived notions about your topic a rea, and close their minds to new learning. Sometimes it is helpf ul to administer a brief pre-\u00adtest of knowledge, self-\u00adef ficacy, and attitudes, to a ssist learners in becoming better aware of their educa tional needs. 3. Teach kno wledge and skills sequentially fro m simple to complex Start with the basics, or review the basics when teaching complex concepts a nd skills. Many concepts and skills that comprise medical practice are quite complex. Students learning the complexities of acute renal failure must first understand acid base balance and the ranges of normal electrolytes. Similarly, skills, including interviewing, physical examination and other procedura l skills, rely on learning basic skills first. Members of house staff teams from diverse backgrounds may have had dif ferent experiences with learning certain basics. You will often need to assess their fa miliarity with core concepts and review some basics before teaching advanced topics. B egin your teaching from the level of learner unders tanding. 4. When you teach skills, define t hem and present them as discrete behavio rs Clearly describe skills, demonstrate them, a nd articulate performance standards (anchors).Whether you're teaching simple or complex skills, describe orally and in written handouts the behaviors that comprise them. Demonstrate the skills and articulate performance standa rds (anchors) that allow learners to assess their progress against those standards. Observe learners as they practice, and teach learners to observe each other and give feedback, using the anchors. Showing brief videos of ef fective skill performance in a medical context can enhance understanding. 5. Enhan ce learning o f kno wledge and skills through repetit ion and reinfo rcement Present alternative descriptions of key principles and show multiple exa mples of important or complex skills. \"See one, do one, teach one\" is seldom the most ef fective technique f or mastery of skills. Sometimes learners must see complex procedures multiple times before attempting them with expert guidance and repetition until mast ery. For behaviors or concepts that are especially important or particularly complex, give multiple exa mples that shed further light on their utility and execution in va ried contexts. 6. Provide effect ive feedback Giving feedback shows learners that you a re fully engaged, and feedback speeds learning of knowledge and skills. When you give feedback to learners and demonstra te that you ca n both praise su ccess and help them with deficiencies, you show that you value your teaching role. You build trust and relationship, show your willingness to fully engage, and show that you value their success. Your engagement with learners through your f eedback thus individua lizes and speeds the learning process. Learn feedback principles a nd be certain to capitalize on the many opportunities presented to you for using feedback as a teaching tool. (9) In addition to formal f eedback sessions, f eedback can be used within teaching sessions to facilitate learning for the individua l and the group. Module 40 presents principles and guidelines and illustrates the process in varied contexts. 7. Ensure early success Ensure that learners can demonstrate knowledge or skill acquisition. When learners experience success in lea rning, that success enhances their confidence and motiva tion to continue learning. Establish goals and objectives that most learners will be able to achieve and demonstrate in that session or within a short time. Organize learning activities that provide opportunities to observe and comment on learner successes, perhaps through quizzes, evoking discussion with good questions, skills practice in role play or other simulation. Whether you are teaching new knowledge or new skills, your honest praise to students for their successful learning increases their self-\u00adconfidence and enjoyment of learning, as well as their rega rd for you as a teacher.8. Mo nitor and attend to learners' emo tions When you respond with empathy to learner expression of reluctance, stress and distress, your sessions can be more eff ective. The stresses of medical school a nd residency training can lead to anxiety and demoralization. These and other negative attitudes and emotions, such as feeling inadequate, guilty or lonely, inhibit learning. Monitor the emotional \"temperature\" of learners. Sometimes group members will seem somber, or stressed, or be reluctant to answer questions. Some learners, especially in the middle of an internship, may be depressed or burned out. (10) Sometimes you as a teacher may be asking too much of your learners or you may have inadvertently said something that left them confused or upset. You create an a tmosphere that maximizes learning possibilities when learners know you care and that you understand their f eelings. If you ignore, put down or make light of learner distress, you add another obstacle to effective learning. If, on the other hand, you inquire about what people are f eeling and show your concern and willingness to try to address some of the issues, you can \"clear the air,\" motivating and preparing your learners. Of course you cannot take responsibility for resolving outside situations, but simply a cknowledging their signif icance reassures learners, f reeing them up to participate. Sometimes you learn something as simple as that group members are in the middle of major tests, or boards. You further enhance engagement a nd motiva tion when you provide encouragement and emotional support in a non-\u00adjudgmental and empathic fashion. 9. Encourage interactio n, quest ions, and reflectio n Demonstrating that you value comments, questions and interactions f rom each learner and among all team members stimulates learning and assimilation of new material. You set the tone for exciting and stimulating learning on ward rounds or in small group sessions when you invite and value interactions a mong all group members. Improve group interaction by encouraging questions and comments. Ensure that learners know that all questions are good questions. Acknowledge a nd praise comments and questions, and use them as springboa rds for your own questions and comments, as you put them in perspective f or the team. Further stimulate discussion by asking provocative questions and encouraging learners to take intellectua l risks in proposing diagnostic hypotheses or solutions to problems. Reflection, that is, the consideration of the larger context, the meaning, and the implications of a n experience or an action, allows the assimilation and reordering of concepts, skills, knowledge, and values into pre-\u00adexisting structures. Ask learners to take time to reflect on what they are learning, both in real time a nd after the session. Encourage individua ls to return to the next session and share the insights they attain. Active ref lection promotes the professiona l growth of individuals. (9) 10. Pro vide fo rmative and summative evaluatio ns Each skillfully conducted evaluative conversation (written or ora l) that you conduct with learners motivates and assists them in setting f urther learning goals Forma tive evaluations help learners shape their learning. Summative evaluations communicate students' grades and revea l the knowledge or skills on which they need to continue working. To ma ximize the benef it of evaluations, schedule them in advance, and assure that your learners share the expectations, goals a nd objectives of the evaluations. When provided in a constructive and personal but non-\u00adjudgmental manner, evaluations motivate learners to continue in their pursuit of knowledge and skills. Learners may not share your expectations or goals for a course or rotation, or may become side-\u00adtracked by other concerns, so do not omit mid-\u00adblock or other formative evaluations that can redirect learners' efforts. STAGES OF COMPETENCY DEVELOPMENT: TEACHING LEARNERS WITH DIFFERING EDUCATIONAL LEVELS Clinical teaching often involves learners at differing educational levels. Identify learners' levels and adjust your instructional strategies to meet their needs. (11, 12) Each level requires knowledge, structured experiences, emotiona l buy-\u00adin, reflect ion on action, role models, a nd learner-\u00adcentered instruction f or most effective progress toward the next levels. In this section, we address the differing needs of Novice Learners, Advanced Beginners, and Competent Residents, and discuss appropriate teaching stra tegies. Novice Learners For novice learners, highlight key pertinent data from their exams that help distinguish among diagnoses and encourage more intensive study of one or two competing hypotheses about diagnostic or trea tment options. Advanced Learners For advanced students and interns, require them to formulate differential diagnoses, help them to set priorities, and reinforce the meaning of context to the clinica l problems. Competent Learners For increasingly competent residents, balance supervision and autonomy, helping them become aware of the emotional and clinical care consequences both of never asking for help or lacking the confidence to trust their own thinking and decisions. Novice Learners For novice learners, highlight key pertinent data from their exams that help distinguish among diagnoses and encourage more intensive study of one or twocompeting hypotheses about diagnostic or trea tment options. The novice learner on a clinical team has little clinical experience, typically at a second or early third year medical student level. The novice is unable to filter or prioritize data so that synthesis is difficult. Everything seems equally important. With little experience to draw upon, the student performs best when provided rules, such a s \"when you encounter this, do that,\" or \"when an adult patient compla ins of chest pain, always identify cardiovascular risk f actors and assess for cardiac causes.\" On their f irst clinical rotations, novice students typically perform H&Ps using a set of rules or templates. Regardless of the Chief Compla int, they methodically go through each item on the generic templa te. They have no capacity to focus the information gathering on the basis of a likely dif ferentia l diagnosis and do not yet comprehend the big picture. When preparing a written H&P, pertinent positives and negatives remain scattered throughout the ROS rather than being discussed in the HPI. Each sign and symptom seems equally relevant. These students still have limited abilities to synthesize the myriad pieces of information into a unified summary. Using learned rules, they link the clinical da ta to their knowledge of the pathophysiology of disease. The teacher ca n employ specific strategies for novice level learners: Provide rules. Point out meaningful diagnostic information in H/P. Eliminate irrelevant inf ormation. Highlight discriminating f eatures with relative importa nce to diagnosis. Encourage reading of two or more diagnostic hypotheses to compare and contrast. Advanced Learners For advanced students and interns, require them to formulate differential diagnoses, help them to set priorities, and reinforce the meaning of context to the clinica l problems. The advanced beginner is typified by third and fourth year students through early internship who have experience with many clinical encounters. Advanced beginners use their experience to sort through rules and da ta to decide wha t is releva nt. They begin to use pattern recognition to solve problems, seeing the big picture and how specific information rela tes to it. They begin to create their own personalized rules and \"maxims\" from meaningful prior experiences. At the beginning of the intern year, when advanced beginners a re taking H&Ps, they begin to generate a diff erential diagnosis that drives data gathering in a more focused direction. B ecause they are capable of filtering information a nd focusing on the relevant, they are able to formulate a unified summary of the case. When writing notes, they can a bstract the pertinent positives and negatives f rom the ROS and appropriately incorporate them into the HPI. Recognizing the advanced beginner on the team, the teacher ca n employ specif ic strategies individualized for this competency level: Support in setting priorities. Help identifying meaningful patterns in various situations. Work from the common to the uncommon. Reframe data, such as the Chief Complaint, into problem representations.Require the formulation of diff erential diagnosis. Be attentive to meaningful or situational aspects of the clinical presentations, to reinforce importa nce of context. Competent Learners For increasingly competent residents, balance supervision and autonomy, helping them become aware of the emotional and clinical care consequences both of never asking for help or lacking the confidence to trust their own thinking and decisions. Competent residents, usu ally approaching the end of residency, possess a wealth of clinica l experience upon which to compare and contra st patient presentations. This provides competent clinicians with a perspective to determine importa nt or ignored elements. They are able to see the big picture, using clinica l reasoning tips f rom analytic to pattern recognition f or solving common problems, but complex or uncommon problems req uire reliance on analytic reasoning. B ecause supervising residents must decide what plan to choose and when to choose it without being sure, every situation requires coping with uncertainty, which is both f rightening and exhausting. It becomes a n emotional roller coaster consisting of the pain of mistakes and elation of successes. Self-\u00adawareness allows managed emotiona l involvement, which a dvances deve lopment. Without self-\u00adawareness, this roller coaster may produce resistance to risk or responsibility, which leads to stagnation of development. Competent residents build on many clinical experiences as they near the end of residency, a nd recognize common illness patterns. They easily see the big picture. Because of their enlarged responsibilities, they see more consequences of their clinical decisions , which results in an emotiona l buy-\u00adin to learning. When they encounter new or unf amiliar problems, they methodically reason through each step of the case, sometimes successf ully and sometimes getting stuck. They f eel responsible f or their decision-\u00admaking process and are consciously a ware of their own roles in contributing to the clinical outcomes. Recognizing the competent learner on the team, the teacher can employ specific strategies individualized for this competency level: Balance supervision with autonomy. Hold competent learners accountable for decisions. Telling wha t to do prevents emotional buy-\u00adin. Expose the competent resident to the breadth and depth of problems to construct illness scripts (patterns). Reassure these residents that it ok to not know and to ask for help. This is important f or all levels of learners, but perhaps more so for the competent resident who may f eel that at this level they are expected to be masterf ul in all instances. ENGAGING LEARNERS AND STIMULATING LEARNING IN CLINICAL TEACHING SETTINGS In the following sections we discuss concepts and skills tha t promote active learning, in groups and with individual learners.The topics we address in this section a re the following: Role Mo deling At each level of training, you will be a role model for junior colleagues. Facilitat ion skills fo r small gro ups Medical students, resident clinicia ns, clinical f aculty and others will lead small groups of learners. Questio ning skills Asking questions helps you understand learners' level of understanding and their learning needs. Video Example At Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia, Dr. Joseph Boselli is one of the most appreciated teachers. We present Dr. Boselli introducing himself at his f irst attending rounds or a rotation, and intern comments a fterwards on why his teaching is effective. Role Mo deling At each level of training, you will be a role model for junior colleagues. Maximize your ef fectiveness as a role model by strengthening positive personal qua lities, clinica l proficiency and teaching expertise. Young clinicians look to their senior colleagues for inspira tion and guidance in all aspects of the practice of medicine. Role models shape those va lues, a ttitudes and skills that chara cterize clinician \"professionalism,\" as well a s students' career choices. (13) In today's hectic healthcare environments, excellent role models are harder to find, and many harried clinicians demonstrate distinctly unprof essiona l values a nd behaviors. Recent studies of role modeling and the processes of learning through role modeling have identif ied qualities of excellent role models and key a spects of learning from them.(14) In one important study, house staff at four hospitals identified 141 clinicians as excellent role models. In contrast to 200 other attendings, the excellent role models were more likely to have attended tea ching workshops, to stress the importance of the doctor-patient relationship in their teaching, to teach about the psychosocial aspects of medicine, and to provide in-\u00addepth feedback to house staff. They were more likely to say they enjoy clinica l teaching, to rate themselves more highly as a role model a nd to share professional and persona l experiences with learners.(13) According to another recent study (15), some qualities of role models that learners value highly include personal attributes such a s compassion, a sense of humor, and integrity, clinical proficiency in diagnosis, effective interaction with patients and families, and skillful teaching such as the ability to expla in complex subjec ts, stimulate thinking and interact in a non-\u00adthreatening manner. The authors of this study suggest severa l strategies you might undertake to improve the \"role model\" aspect of your teaching. These strategies include the f ollowing: Be aware that you are a role model with learners at every level. Show that you value this role. Demonstrate clinical competence. Be explicit a bout what you are modeling, whenever possible. Help learners reflect on your modeling a nd what they learn from it.Protect time for teaching. Implement a learner-\u00adcentered a pproach to teaching. Encourage dialogue among colleagues. Engage in pertinent f aculty development. Work to improve the institutional culture. Facilitat ion skills fo r small gro ups Medical students, resident clinicia ns, clinical f aculty and others will lead small groups of learners in rounds, case conferences, didactic informa tional sessions and other settings. We incorporate attitudes, educational principles, and skills into a summary of keys to effective small group teaching. The areas we include f or more intensive review and study are the following: Planning learning sessio ns For your assigned and scheduled teaching sessions, develop goals, divide the time into segments and follow your schedule. Skills fo r opening and co nducting a sessio n Always let participants know that you care about their learning. Skills fo r mo nitoring the pace and fo r closing a sessio n Be aware of elapsed time, devote time to a summa ry of the session and involve participants in debrief ing your leadership and the session's ef fectiveness. Planning learning sessions For your assigned and scheduled teaching sessions, develop goals, divide the time into segments and follow your schedule, use more tha n one teaching strategy, a nd hav e a written or digital handout. Planning improves the quality of learning sessions. D ecide on your goa ls and objectives and write them down. D etermine what materials and teaching methods you will use to achieve these goals and objectives. Provide a handout that summarizes essential points and might also serve as a n outline f or the session. D ecide approximately how much time you will allot to each learn ing objective, and each segment of the session. D evelop teaching strategies for each segment and vary teaching methods, not only to keep the session consistently interesting, but also to address varying learning styles of participants. For example, in planning a session around a patient with a particular problem, you might briefly introduce the topic, ask participants for their experiences in dealing w ith this problem and discuss those, highlight the important information to elicit f rom patients, do a brief patient interview and exam, discuss these findings and their implications, a nd then summarize essential learning points, referring to a brief handout or article. When teaching about healthca re relationships and communication skills such a s discussion a bout advance directives, including time for succinct, focused role-\u00adplays can be illustrative and engaging. Skills fo r opening and co nducting a sessio n Always let participants know that you care about their learning. Use words and non-\u00ad verbal communication to show that you welcome questions and comments. Acknowledge contributions and involve everyone. First impressions set the tone. When beginning a new group, take a f ew minutes to introduce yourself and invite ea ch of the participants to do the same. You might ask them about their backgrounds and in terests, to say something that nobody knows about them, what they are hoping for in this group, etc. Getting to know participa nts in a personal way helps set a positive learning clima te. Communicate to participants that you care about them and their professional development, and tha t a key goal for your own work is to foster a stimulating, fun, and safe environment, with their help. Keep your session l earner-\u00adcentered. In addition to soliciting learners' feedback on whether the session was learner centered, another gauge is this: if you leave thinking you really showed them how much you know, you ma y have missed responding to what they really needed to learn. An additional goal for group leaders is to help participants to share opinions, take intellectua l risks and work together. Welcome questions, a nd invite other group members to respond to them before you do so. Involve the quiet members of the group, (\"John, I would be interested in hearing your opinion,\") and solicit contrary or minority opinions (\"Shireen, from what you've said, I expect you might have another opinion on this-\u00ad if so, would you share it with us?\") A cknowledge each learner's contribution. B ecome a patient listener, ask simple questions that help learners refine their thinking, and notice what concerns they are not saying that may be relevant. Share your own insights and experiences only when they will advance the dialogue, never to show that you know the \"right answer\". When working with a group of multi-\u00adlevel learners, such a s a ward team, you might begin with a basic question and gradua lly move to advanced questions direc ted at the senior members. In that way, everyone can participate and know they have contributed to group learning. Observe and comment occasionally on non-\u00adverbal expressions of confusion, excitement or disinterest. When someone appea rs bored or uninterested, you might ask the learner his or her perspective on the issue. Your intervention can provoke useful a djustments to pace, tone, involvement or topi c. Skills fo r mo nitoring the pace and fo r closing a session Be aware of elapsed time, devote time to a summa ry of the session and involve participants in debrief ing your leadership and the session's ef fectiveness, a nd close at the designated time. Keep one eye on the clock, because interesting discussions that go over the time that you've a llotted ca n limit coverage of additional key topics. Of course, flexibility trumps rigidity in dynamic learning sessions, but you need to take charge, perhaps saying, \"This is a fascinating discussion, and we need to move on. Jason, would you look up a review article on this topic and report back tomorrow?\" Remember that every person on the tea m is as busy and commited as you are, and that closing at the designated time shows tha t you respect the needs of the team membersAs the session approaches closing time, take steps to solidify learning, reach closure, and plan for the next session. Ask participants to summarize the key lessons, and as you listen, paraphrase individual contributions. A t times, you might ask each group member to say one thing they learned, or what they might apply in their clinical work in the next week. Identify learning issues for the next session, and if you haven't done so already, ask a volunteer to look up the answers to questi ons or to ma ke a brief presenta tion at the next session. Seek feedback about the session' s learner-\u00ad centeredness and utility, and inquire about how the group and your leadership could be more effective. Questio ning skills Asking questions helps you understand learners' level of understanding and their learning needs. Skillful questions stimulate learners' thinking a nd motiva tion to learn more. Group part icipants learn best when they are actively engaged in learning. Your questioning skills can be powerful in stimulating learning. When you engage learners in discussion through use of questions that expand their thinking and stimulate problem-\u00ad solving and critical thinking, you promote active learning. Ma ny obstacles ca n reduce the eff ectiveness of otherwise effective questioning strategies. The followi ng list shows some common barriers to discussion: Requiring a quick response to questions. Allow time f or learners to think. Framing the question at a level of complexity beyond learners' expected level of knowledge. Calibra te questions to fit your lea rners' needs. Conveying lack of confidence that responses will adequately address the question. Show learners that you respect their competence. Praise successes, however small. Allowing only strong learners to respond to inquiries. Call on other learners when you have someone who is too quick. Ignoring the student' s fear of being wrong. Remind learners that \"wrong, or off track\" does not equate to \"poor eff ort, or bad student\", and that learning from mistakes or poor thinking facilita tes better understanding. The types of questions we include f or more intensive review and study a re the following: Open-\u00adended Questio ning Open-\u00adended questions facilitate discussion a nd help you assess learners' cognitive strategies a nd ability to generate and test hypotheses. \"Follow-\u00adup\" questio ns Use increasingly closed-\u00adended questions to involve learners who may be less facile with higher cognitive strategies. \"Directed\" quest ions Directed questions help you guide learners' thinking a nd stimulate problem-\u00ad solving. Excellent sources for these kinds of questions are \"The Clinician as Teacher\" by N.Whitman and T.L. Schwenk, and Teachers: A Guide Educational by T.L. Schwenk and N. Whitman(19, 20)Open-\u00adEnded Questioning Open-\u00adended questions facilitate discussion, rather than seeking \"right\" answers, and help you assess learners' cognitive strategies and ability to generate and test hypotheses. Open-\u00adended questions possess chara cteristics that promote active learning. For example, they seldom have \"correct\" answers, they suggest tha t people may have differing answers and they require that responders consider more than one f actor in developing answers. Additionally, the questioners may have some ideas but is asking for responses they might not have considered. The questioners wish for respondents to \"think out loud\" rather than parrot the \"right\" answer. Asking open questions can help you avoid the norma l tendency to show your knowledge, and help learners better grasp complex ideas or concepts. Putting out your own \" expert\" interpretation too early can suppress thinking and discussion by others. When someone a nswers, listen attentively and ask others f or their input. A good continuer, if discussion seems slow is to simply reflect back whatever a respondent says, adding something like, \"Do I understand you correctly?\" or, \"Is that what others understood?\" Examples of open-\u00adended questions are the following: What is the signif icance or relevance of a particular fact or observation? Why do you think so? Who else a grees? I'm always interested in hearing from those who might disagree with this notion. Is there someone with another ta ke on this? What if the circumstances change? For example what if the patient were... What do you do next? Here is my idea, but I expect there are other ways to look at \"x\". What a re your thoughts? Clinical Scenario #1 On rounds, your team sees a patient with HIV admitted for cough and shortness of breath. She has never been on HAART, her last CD4 count wa s 150, and she takes no medications at home. Teacher: \"Wha t is the signif and why?\" Learner: \"A CD4 count less than 200 puts the pat ient at risk for opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis pneumonia.\" Teacher: \"Wha t if the CD4 does that change your thoughts?\" Learner: \"PCP would be unlikely if the CD4 count were that high. Then you would consider the typical organisms that cause CAP\u2014Strep pneumo, H.flu, M.catarrhalis, L.maltophilia. Also, regardless of the I would consider TB in the dif ferential for this patient.\" Teacher: \"What dia gnose patient's problem?\" Learner: \"I would order a chest x-\u00adray, get a sputum gram stain and culture, sputum for AFB, check her pulse oximetry, a nd check both her CBC for white cell count and order a CD4 count.\"\"Follow-\u00adup\" questio ns Use increasingly closed-\u00adended questions to involve learners who may be less facile with higher cognitive strategies, and to help assess the knowledge base of learners. It may be helpful to build on your questions: start with simple concepts, then ask for further details, gra dually leading learners to more complex thinking. This kind of exercise helps learners to expand their thin king. Reflecting back on what you just sa id, could you clarify... Tell me more about... How do you account f or... Help me to understand... Clinical Scenario #2 Your tea m later sees an elderly male admitted f or dyspnea . He is found to have pulmonary congestion on chest x-\u00adray and has rales on his pulmonary exam. Learner: \"So, based on the shortness of breath, rales, a nd pulmonary vascular congestion on x-\u00adray, we are n for CHF exacerbation with diuretics.\" dia gnosis.\" Learner: \"Well, the patient has a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease with several MI' s in the past. He likely has a reduced systolic function that led to progressive left heart f ailure a nd pulmonary congestion. We should check a 2D Echo to determine his ejection fraction.\" Teacher: \"How do you account f or this sudden onset of symptoms when he previously had been well?\" Learner: \"Well, it could be that he has suffered another MI, perhaps silent, that worsened his systolic function f urther. If he had a murmur on exam, I would consider worsened valve disease such as mitral regurg that caused this sudden decline. Most likely, though, it has to do with the fact that he admits to not always taking his medications. This makes him more at risk for MI as well a s uncontrolled hyperten sion that may have resulted in patient's medication list\u2014metoprolol, lisinopril, aspirin, simvastatin\u2014 help ra tionale behind using these medications.\" Learner: \"The statin is for cholesterol lowering, the aspirin is a n antiplatelet that helps prevent further MIs, the beta-\u00adblocker helps keep heart rate and blood pressure down, and the ACE-\u00adinhibitor is f or both blood pressure control as well a s prevention of cardiac remodeling, a process that occurs af ter MI and ultimately results in worsened cardiac function.\" \"Directed\" quest ions Directed questions help you guide learners' thinking and stimulate problem-\u00adsolving. They model how teachers think critically about problems.Using directed questions helps learners explore the depths of the situation at hand and understand it more fully. They also begin to imagine the complexity and variety of situations they will likely be called upon to manage that differ slightly f rom the present one. Examples of directed questions f ollow: Which hypotheses help explain...? What data would you need to...? How would your hypotheses be ranked if the patient were a .....instead of...? If a vital laboratory test was unavailable, what would you do instead? What important questions about this pa tient's disease remain unanswered? Clinical Scenario #3 The team' s next patient is a 67year old man with a long history of smoking and alcohol a buse who was admitted with dyspha gia. Teacher: \"So this gentleman has a six-\u00admonth history of progressive dysphagia. What hypotheses help explain his dysphagia?\" Learner: \"Well, top on the list is going to be esophageal cance r given his age, his history of both heavy smoking and drinking, and his progressive symptoms. An unknown is whether it would be adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. Obviously, he is a lso at risk for other malignancies, lung especially, but he gives no history of pulmonary symptoms. Other possibilities are neurologic such as myasthenia gravis.\" Teacher: \"What do you do next to help diagnosis his p roblem?\" Learner: \"He needs an upper endoscopy.\" Teacher: \"How would your differential change if this patient had never smoked or drank?\" Learner: \"Well, the malignancies would be lower on the list, I guess. Myasthenia, especia lly bulbar myasthenia would go higher. I would also add other possibilities such as esophageal webs or rings. I guess I would also wonder about conditions like esophagitis, possibl y from ref lux or infectious.\" Teacher: \"What if our gastroenterology collea gues were all out of town and no one was available to do an endoscopy. Is there a test you could do instead?\" Learner: \"Well, you could do a barium swallow to look for masses.\" Teacher: \"Even with endoscopy, what questions may remain unanswered for this patient's diagnosis and prognosis?\"Learner: \"Well, obviously, we'd need to w ait for the pathology report to come back on any sa mples that were taken during endoscopy. Also, if it is ca ncer, we'd need to determine staging with CT Scanning of his chest, abdomen, and pelvis.\" Please click the video-\u00adbutt on on the left andwatch an attending clinician teaching a student after seeing a patient together.

Dr. Joseph Boselli and his Interns At Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia, D r. Joseph Boselli is one of the most appreciated teachers. In this video, Dr. Boselli introduces himself at his first attending round s of a rotation, and interns comment af terwa rds on why his teaching is effective. TAKING THE TEAM TO THE BEDSIDE The complex dyna mics of an encounter with a patient a long with multiple levels of learners, each with individualized needs, is a challenge requiring attentiveness to respectfulness of both the patient and all learners. Bedside teaching necessitates careful attention to the patient' s comfort a nd dignity. Teaching at the patient's bedside is a powerful opportunity to role model f or learners. They can be inspired by your ability to maintain a delicate balance between showing kindness, respect and caring f or the patient and attending to tea m members' learning needs. They can observe your demeanor and skills as you exa mine the patient and conduct parallel conversations with patient, f amily and team members. Further, you observe firsthand the learners' interactions with the pa tient and the patient' s family. Physical examination and communication skills can be directly demonstrated, a nd the key learning points can be ba sed upon data tha t all team members directly observe and share. (16-\u00ad18) Attend to structural elements of a bedside teaching session to maximize the learning benef it. Obtain permi ssion from the patient in advance of the tea m's arrival. Engage a ll team members in establishing both learning goals and a role for each team member to play. When you approach the bedside, introduce each team member and the purpose of your rounds. Attend to the patient' s comfort and to a ny communication barriers such as pain, privacy, or need to use the bathroom. Attend to all the learners and give them chances to ask questions or appreciate a physical finding, with the patient' s permission. Share some aspects of the \"teacher\" role with senior team members, both to demonstrate teamwork a nd to advance their skills. A void jargon, and engage the patient beyond the history and physical, perhaps by asking what she thinks about her doctors' thoughts or what a dditional ideas she might have. Monitor the pat ient's physical and emotional state, and cut short the session if thepatient tires. If someone a sks an uncomfortable or inappropriate question for that patient, take the opportunity to assure the patient tha t she is not required to discuss such an issue in f ront of the group, and remind her about your commitment to confidentiality. In front of the patient, a s you conclude the visit, arrange for a team member to return later to clarif y any questions or misunderstandings. Finally, solicit feedback on your teaching and role modeling so a s to improve you r own skills and jointly examine in more depth the impact of selected aspects of the encounter. Summary of steps to enhance bedside teaching: Obtain permission f rom the patient Establish learning goals for the visit and roles f or each team member Introduce a ll members of the tea m Attend to patient comfort a nd understanding Encourage interaction and examination of the patient under your observation Solicit and provide feedback AnnotatedVideo (not shown in print-\u00adout text) FACULTY DEVELOPMENT No two sessions are alike. You teach beginners or more advanced learners, a nd mixed groups. Moods cha nge, crises happen, new information becomes ava ilable. Teachers who value their work can continually improve. The material in this DocCom module is necessarily a summary, a nd brief. Many easily accessed resource s can assist the f aculty member who wishes to steadily improve. We recommend the following: In two excellent articles, Azer, Pinsky and their collea gues summarize the qualities of effective teachers and how they use certain strategies to maximize learning. (21, 22) Kelley Skef f and his collea gues incorpora te many of the concepts we discuss in the Stanford Faculty D evelopment Program (http://sf dc.stanfo rd.edu/ ). They suggest tha t teachers enrich their capabilities in key instructional ca tegories. Studies show that Dr. Skeff's program improves f aculty teaching skills and educational outcomes. (23) The instructional categories are as follows: Learning climate Control of session Communication of goals Promotion of understanding a nd retention Evaluation Feedback Promotion of self-\u00addirected lea rning. Finally, the American Aca demy on Healthcare Communication (AACH) offers many national, regional and institutiona l faculty development courses that are high quality, helping many faculty to achieve their potentia l as teachers. (http://www.aachonline.org/ ) SELF AWARENESS The stresses of clinical teaching may evoke inadvertent hurtful interactions with learners and other staff -\u00ad even to the point of abusing them. Develop awareness of your \"hot buttons\" and choose to attempt to respond with empa thy. D iscussions with trusted colleagues and/or counseling ma y be very helpf ul. Celebra te teaching skills that you ca rry out well, and give yourself credit. You will grow as an educator if you invite, accept and respond to constructive f eedback, learn from your mistakes, and ref lect on what goes well and what you might change. D o not let \"excellent\" be the enemy of the good. Modules 2 and 4 address mindfulness, self-\u00ad reflection and self care, and certain review articles are also helpf ul. (5, 6) Clinical education that involves sick and often dying patients, families a nd other team members is by its nature stressful for learners and tea chers. Sometimes you m ay realize that you left your learners hurt or bewildered, or receive feedback to that ef fect. Medical students who wish to \"know everything\" and \"care for everyone\" a re easily hurt. Furthermore, outright abuse of students occurs, (25, 26) a nd sometimes we are the inadvertent abusers. Under pressure, for example on a busy ward service, we may be short with some learners, pimp others in a harsh and judg mental way, or deride learners' \"wrong\" answers. This ma y have happened to you as a learner, and maybe you learned a lot from being humiliated, or felt it made you \"stronger\" in some way. You may think some \"unmotivated\" or \"irresponsible\" learners deserve such treatment. However, if you f ind yourself being hard on your learners, pause and take a closer look. Are unrelated problems diminishing your ef fectiveness with the learner? Sometimes it is in the rela tionship with you and the learner. D oes the learner remind you of someone with whom you have had problems? Which of your \"hot buttons\" does the learner's conduct (or lack of it) push, provoking your defensiveness or counterattack? At the very least, take the time to engage a shamed, humiliated, reactive, haughty or \"bored\" learner in a conversatio n that might not only clear the air but also enrich the educa tional experience f or both of you. Take a close and frank look at your situation, and check your emotional tempera ture. A re you stressed, burning out, depressed or angry? Are you short with nurses or other staff members? A re your intimate relationships in trouble? If so, make time to speak with someone you trust and consider seeking counselin g from a mental health prof essiona l. Few people enga ged in clinical teaching escape the need to examine and \"rewrite\" an emotional story or script at some time or other so that we improve our well-\u00adbeing, balance and tea ching interactions. CONCLUSION Clinical teaching presents unique challenges to the educator. Often, both patient and learner require a ccura te diagnosis and intervention appropriate to th e unique needs of each. The goa ls of clinica l teaching f ocus on exposing the clinical reasoning process in order to assess the learner and improve their skills a nd knowledge, while insuring quality patient care. Ef fective teachers continuously improve their knowledge of the principles of educa tion, curriculum development, and teaching techniques, reflect on their attitudes, practice relevant teaching skills, seek, welcome and act on constructive feedback, and cultiva te self-\u00adawareness about your teaching practices. Clinical teaching at the patient's bedside is an opportunity f or effective role modeling, direct observation of learners in action and demonstration of clinical skills. Bedside teaching in small groups requires planning, facilitation skills, and use of discrete types of questions. D one well, clinica l teaching f osters self-\u00adreflection and provides necessary feedba ck to promote self-\u00addirected lea rning which learners may employ f or a lifetime of learning.BEHAVIOR CHECKLIST 1.
