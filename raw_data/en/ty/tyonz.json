Luongo , PhD, Executive Director 2 ASAM is honored that this guideline has been endorsed by: 3 4 Ameri can College of Preventive Medicine 5 American Osteopathic Academy of Addiction Medicine 6 Federation of State Physician Health Programs 7 National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers 8 National Association of Clinical Nurse Specialists 9 National Commission on Correctional Health Care 10 3 GLOSSARY 1 Glossary of Terms 2 Below are terms that are used throughout the guideline. Note that some terms listed below are used to 3 convey a specific meaning for the purposes of this guideline (e.g., \" clinician s\"). 4 Abstinence: Intentional and consistent restraint from the pathological pursuit of reward and/or relief that 5 involves the use of substances and other behaviors. These behavio rs may involve, but are not necessarily 6 limited to substance use, gambling, video gaming, or compulsive sexual behaviors. Use of FDA approved 7 medications for the treatment of substance use disorder is consistent with abstinence . 8 Addiction Specialist Physi cian: Addiction specialist physicians include addiction medicine physicians 9 and addiction psychiatrists who hold either a subspecialty board certification in addiction medicine by the 10 American Board of Preventative Medicine , a board certification in addict ion medicine from the American 11 Board of Addiction Medicine, a subspecialty board certification in addiction psychiatry from the 12 American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, a subspecialty board certification in addiction medicine 13 from the American Osteopath ic Association, or certification in addiction medicine from the American 14 Society of Addiction Medicine . 15 Adjunct therapy (see also monotherapy) : A pharmaceutical drug used together with a primary 16 pharmaceutical drug whose purpose is to assist the primary treatment .1 17 Alcohol H allucinosis /Alcohol -induced Psychotic Disorder : See Special Terms . 18 ASAM Criteria dimensions: The ASAM Criteria use six dimensions to define a holistic biopsychosocial 19 assessment of an individual to be used for service and treatment planning including acute intoxication or 20 withdrawal potential ; biomedical conditions and complications ; emotional, behavioral, or cognitive 21 conditions or complications ; readiness for change ; continued use or continued problem potential ; and 22 recovery/living environment. 23 CIWA -Ar: The Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Scale, Revised, is a reliable, valid, 24 and repr oducible scale that measures the severity of alcohol withdrawal once a diagnosis has been made.2 25 Complicated alcohol withdrawal: See Special Terms . 26 Clinicians (Healthcare providers): Used throughout the guideline, this term is intentionally broad. It 27 encompasses anyone who participates in providing care to patients with substance use disorder s, 28 including staff at specialty addiction treatment centers or other healthcare settings that provide substance 29 use disorder treatment.3 30 Fixed -dosing: See Special Terms . 31 Front loading: See Special Terms . 32 GABAergic agents: Drugs that affect the neurotrans mitter GABA or receptors . These include 33 agonists, antagonists, modulators, reuptake inhibitors and enzymes . Examples include benzodiazepines, 34 phenobarbital, and carbamazepine. 35 Inpatient Withdrawal Management : See Special Terms . 36 4 GLOSSARY Kindling: The relationship between repeated episodes of alcohol withdrawal which become progressively 1 more severe is referred to as the kindling effect or process.4 The effect is theorized to be the result of 2 increased neuronal excitabili ty and sensitivity with repeated episodes of withdrawal and has been 3 demonstrated to result in increased craving for alcohol and decreased responsiveness to treatment with 4 benzodiazepines.5-7 5 Level of Care: See Special Terms . 6 Monotherapy (see also adjunct therapy) : The use of a single drug to treat a disorder or disease . 7 Patient s: Used throughout the guideline, this term is intentionally broad. It encompasses anyone who 8 receives care for a S ubstance Use Disorder (S UD) in a specialty SUD treatment center or other healthcare 9 setting.3 10 Pharmacotherapy: Therapy (medical treatment) using pharmaceutical drugs . 11 Recovery capital : The breadth and depth of internal and external resources that can be drawn upon to 12 initiate and sustain recovery from alcohol and other drug problems . It can be found at the personal, social, 13 community and cultural level s. Examples of recovery capital incl ude physical health, financial assets, 14 supportive social relationships, visible local recovery role models, and accessible/affordable community 15 resources .8 16 Substance use: Used instead of \"drug use\" or \"drug and alcohol use,\" this term refers to the use of 17 psycho tropic substances , which may include illegal drugs, medications or alcohol. This does not refer to 18 nicotine.3 19 Substance Use Disorder (SUD): Substance use disorder is marked by a cluster of cognitive, behavioral, 20 and physiological symptoms indicating that the indivi dual continues to use alcohol, nicotine, and/or other 21 drugs despite significant related problems. Diagnostic criteria are given in the DSM -5. Substance use 22 disorder is the new nomenclature for what was included as substance dependence and substance abuse i n 23 the DSM -4. 24 Supportive care: Treatment given to prevent, control, or relieve complications and side effects and to 25 improve the patient's comfort, quality of life and safety. This can include reassurance, orientation, general 26 nursing care, and adherence to safety measures and protocols (e.g., risk for fall/syncope) . 27 Symptom -triggered dosing : See Special Terms . 28 Therapeutic window : Range of drug dose amount needed to maintain therapeutic effect yet avoid 29 adverse events. A drug with a narrower therapeutic window requires greater precision to be dosed 30 correctly and safely compared to a drug with a broader therapeutic window. A drug's therapeutic window 31 is taken into account when modifying dose amount due to patient variability and exposure to other 32 substances including adjunt medications.9 33 Treatment plan: A therapeutic strategy that may incorporate patient education, drug therapy, and the 34 participation of health professionals. Treatment plans are especially important in the optimal management 35 of complex or chronic illnesses such as SUDs.3 36 Unhealthy alcohol use: Includes the foll owing patterns of alcohol use: 1) Binge drinking (defined as 37 consuming 4 or more alcoholic beverages per occasion for women or 5 or more drinks per occasion for 38 men); 2) Heavy drinking (defined as consuming 8 or more alcoholic beverages per week for women or 15 39 5 GLOSSARY or more alcoholic beverages per week for men); 3) Any drinking by pregnant women or those young er 1 than age 21.10 2 Withdrawal Management: This term has replaced the formerly used \"detoxification.\" Withdrawal 3 management refers to the medical and psychological care of patients who are experiencing withdrawal 4 symptoms as a result of ceasing or reducing their substance use .11 The process of withdrawal management 5 includes not only attenuation of the physiological and psychological features of withdrawal, but also 6 interrupting the momentum of habitual compulsive use in persons with SUD .12 7 6 ABBREVIATIONS Abbreviations and Acronyms 1 A2AA Alpha -2 adrenergic agonists 2 ALT Alanine aminotransferase 3 AUDIT -PC Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test - Primary Care 4 ASAM American Society of Addiction Medicine 5 ASSIST Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test 6 AST Aspartate aminotransferase 7 AUD Alcohol Use Disorder 8 BAC Blood Alcohol Concentration or Content 9 BAWS Brief Alcohol Withdrawal Scale 10 CCU Cardiac/Coronary Care Unit 11 CIWA -Ar Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol , Revised 12 CNS Central Nervous System 13 DSM -5 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual - 5 14 ED Emergency Department 15 EEG Electroencephalogram 16 FAS Fetal Alcohol Syndrome 17 FASD Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders 18 FDA Food and Drug Administration 19 GABA Gamma -aminobutyric acid, or -aminobutyric acid 20 GAD -7 Generalized Anxiety Disorder Test - 7 21 GGT Gamma -glutamyl transferase 22 ICU Intensive Care Unit 23 IM Intramuscular 24 IPRAS Interpercentile Range Adjusted for Symmetry 25 IV Intravenous 26 LARS Luebeck Alcohol -Withdrawal Risk Scale 27 MCV Mean corpuscular volume 28 PAWSS Prediction of Alcohol Withdrawal Severity Scale 29 PHQ -9 Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 30 PO By mouth 31 RAM RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method 32 SAMHSA Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 33 SAWS Short Alcohol Withdrawal Scale 34 SUD Substance Use Disorder 35 WHO World Health Organization 36 WM Withdrawal Management 37 7 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Executive Summary 1 Purpose 2 The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) developed this Guideline on Alcohol Withdrawal 3 Management to provide updated information on evidence -based strategies and standards of care for 4 alcohol withdrawal management in both ambulatory and inpatient settings. 5 Background 6 In June 2017, the American Society of Addiction Medicine's (ASAM) Quality Improvemen t Council 7 (QIC) elected to update ASAM's clinical guidelines on alcohol withdrawal management based on several 8 factors. First, ASAM conducted an Educational Needs Assessment in 2016 that showed a strong interest 9 and need for education on withdrawal managem ent. Second, updated QIC policies recommend that all 10 ASAM guidelines should be updated every five years. ASAM's previous guidelines on the topic of 11 alcohol withdrawal management were published in 1997 and 2004. The first guideline, \"Pharmacological 12 Managem ent of Alcohol Withdrawal\"13 was published in JAMA , followed five years later with the most 13 recent guideline entitled \"Management of Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium\"14 in JAMA Internal Medicine , 14 formerly Archives of Internal Medicine. Subsequent guidelines have not been written since the 2004 15 guidelines thus an update was due. Third, the American Psychi atric Association (APA) release d a practice 16 guideline in 2018 on the appropriate use of medications in the treatment of alcohol use disorder that is not 17 inclusive of alcohol withdrawal management.15 An ASAM guideline on alcohol withdrawal should 18 complement APA's guideline to provide clinicians with guidance on treatment and management 19 approaches across a continuum of care . Fourth, outreach to other organizations indicated that other 20 organizations are not planning on creating a guideline on alcohol withdrawal management . 21 The updated clinical guideline is intended to address current practice concerns and provide clear guidance 22 that will lead to more consistent treatment practices in the field. 23 Scope of Guideline 24 While the current clinical guideline focuses primarily on alcohol withdrawal management, it is important 25 to underscore that alcohol withdrawal management alone is not an effective treatment for alcohol use 26 disorder. Withdrawal management should n ot be conceptualized as a discrete clinical service, but rather 27 as a component of the process of initiating and engaging patients in treatment for alcohol use disorder. 28 Intended Audience 29 The intended audience of this guideline is clinicians, mainly physici ans, nurse practitioners, physician 30 assistants, and pharmacists who provide alcohol withdrawal management in specialty and non -specialty 31 addiction treatment settings (including primary care and intensive care and surgery units in hospitals). 32 The guideline will also have utility for administrators, insurers, and policymakers. 33 8 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Qualifying Statement 1 This ASAM Alcohol Withdrawal Management Guideline is intended to aid clinicians in their clinical 2 decision making and patient management. The Guideline strives to i dentify and define clinical decision 3 making junctures that meet the needs of most patients in most circumstances. Clinical decision making 4 should involve consideration of the quality and availability of expertise and services in the community 5 wherein care is provided. In circumstances in which the Guideline is being used as the basis for regulatory 6 or payer decisions, improvement in quality of care should be the goal. Finally, courses of treatment 7 contained in recommendations in this Guideline are effective only if the recommendations, as outlined, 8 are followed. Because lack of patient understanding and adherence may adversely affect outcomes, 9 clinicians should make every effort to promote the patient's understanding of, and adherence to 10 recommended treatmen ts. Patients should be informed of the risks, benefits, and alternatives to a 11 particular treatment, and should be an active party in shared decision making whenever feasible. 12 Recommendations in this Practice Guideline do not supersede any federal or state regulation s. 13 Overview of Methodology 14 In order to develop a comprehensive practice guideline focused on alcohol withdrawal management, we 15 utilized a hybrid of established methodologies. In order to develop the scope of the guideline and draft the 16 guideline statements, we followed the Veterans Health Administration and Department of Defense 17 (VA/DoD) Guideline for Guidelines. To rate and refine the draft guidelines, we used the RAND/UCLA 18 Appropriateness Method (RAM), which is a specific process for combining t he available scientific 19 evidence with the clinical judgment of experts. Quality of the literature reviewed was rated using 20 standardized rating scales and methodology. The external review process was informed by the VA/DoD 21 method. 22 23 9 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Summary of Recommendati ons 1 I. Identification and Diagnosis of Alcohol Withdrawal 2 A. Identification 3 Recommendation I.1: Incorporate universal screening for unhealthy alcohol use into medical settings 4 using a validated scale to help identify patients with or at risk for alcohol use disorder and alcohol 5 withdrawal. 6 Recommendation I.2: For patients known to be using alcohol recently, regularly, and heavily, assess 7 their risk of deve loping alcohol withdrawal even in the absence of signs and symptoms (see II. Initial 8 Assessment for risk factors and risk assessment scale ). 9 Recommendation I.3: For patients who have signs and symptoms suggestive o f alcohol withdrawal, 10 assess the quantity, frequency, and time of day when alcohol was last consumed to determine whether the 11 patient is experiencing or is at risk for developing alcohol withdrawal. For this assessment, it may be 12 helpful to: 13 Use a scale that screens for unhealthy alcohol use (e.g., Alcohol Use Disorders Identification 14 Test-Piccinelli Consumption [AUDIT -PC]) 15 Use information from collateral sources (i.e., family and friends) 16 Conduct a labo ratory test that provides some measure of hepatic function 17 Recommendation I.4: A biological test (blood, breath, or urine) for alcohol use may be helpful for 18 identifying recent alcohol use, particularly in patients unable to communicate or otherwise give a n alcohol 19 use history. When conducting a biological test, consider the range of time (window of detection) in which 20 the test can detect alcohol use. Do not rule out the risk of developing alcohol withdrawal if the result of a 21 test is negative. 22 B. Diagnosis 23 Recommendation I.5: To diagnose alcohol withdrawal and alcohol withdrawal delirium, use diagnostic 24 criteria such as those provided by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5 (DSM -5). To diagnose alcohol 25 use disorder, use diagnostic criteria such as those provided by the DSM -5. 26 Recommendation I.6: Alcohol withdrawal severity assessment scale s (including the Clinical Instrument 27 Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, Revised [CIWA -Ar]) should not be used as a diagnostic tool 28 because scores can be influen ced by conditions other than alcohol withdrawal. 29 Recommendation I. 7: Do not rule in or rule out the presence of alcohol withdrawal for patients who 30 have a positive blood alcohol concentration. 31 10 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY C. Differential Diagnosis 1 Recommendation I. 8: As part of differ ential diagnosis, assess the patient's signs, symptoms, and history. 2 Rule out other serious illnesses that can mimic the signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Determine 3 if patients take medications that can mask the signs and symptoms of alcohol withdr awal. 4 Recommendation I. 9: Do not rule in or rule out a co -occurring disease, co -occurring mental health 5 disorder, co -occurring substance use disorder, or simultaneous withdrawal from other substances even in 6 the presence of alcohol withdrawal. 7 Recommendat ion I.10: Conduct a neurological exam in patients presenting with a seizure to determine 8 etiology. A seizure should only be attributed to alcohol withdrawal if there was a recent cessation of (or 9 reduction in) a patient's alcohol consumption. For patients experiencing new onset seizures or for patients 10 with a known history of alcohol withdrawal seizures showing a new pattern, an electroencephalogram 11 and/or neuroimaging is recommended. For patients with a known history of withdrawal seizure who 12 present with a seizure that can be attributed to alcohol withdrawal, additional neurological testing and a 13 neurology consult may not be necessary. This includes if the seizure was generalized and without focal 14 elements, if a careful neurological examination reveals no evidence of focal deficits, and if there is no 15 suspicion of meningitis or other etiology. 16 Recommendation I.11: For patients presenting with delirium, conduct a detailed neurological and 17 medical examination with appropriate testing to rule out other common causes of delirium regardless of 18 the apparent etiology. Attempt to distinguish between hallucinations associated with alcohol withdrawal 19 delirium and alcohol hallucinosis/alcohol -induced psychotic disorder . 20 II. Initial Assessment of Alcohol Withdrawal 21 A. General Approach 22 Recommendation II.1: First, determine whether a patient is at risk of developing severe and/or 23 complicated alcohol withdrawa l, or complications from alcohol withdrawal . In addition to current signs 24 and symptoms, a validated risk assessment scale and an assessment of individual risk factors should be 25 utilized. 26 Recommendation II.2: A history and physical examination should be included as part of the 27 comprehensive assessment process. Clinicians should conduct this examination themselves or ensure that 28 a current physical examination is contained within the patient's medical record. 29 Recommendation II.3: Additional information about risk factors can be gleaned by interviewing family, 30 friends, and caregivers about a patient's history of alcohol withdrawal, seizures, and delirium, as 31 appropriate. Whenever possible in non -emergent situation s, obtain written or verbal consent from the 32 patient before speaking with or consulting with collateral sources . 33 Recommendation II.4: Clinicians should seek information about the time elapsed since the patient's 34 cessation of (or reduction in) alcohol use. The timeline of symptom onset and severity helps determine the 35 risk window for developing severe or complicated withdrawal. 36 11 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY B. Risk Factors for Severe or Complicated Withdrawal 1 Recommendation II.5: Assess for the following factors associated with increase d patient risk for 2 complicated withdrawal or complications of withdrawal: 3 History of alcohol withdrawal delirium or alcohol withdrawal seizure 4 Numerous prior withdrawal episodes in the patient's lifetime 5 Comorbid medical or surgical illness (especially traumatic brain injury) 6 Increased age (>65) 7 Long duration of heavy and regular alcohol consumption 8 Seizure(s) during the current withdrawal episode 9 Marked autonomic hyperactivity on presentation 10 Physiological dependence on GABAergic agents such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates 11 Recommendation II.6: The following individual factors may increase a patient's risk for complicated 12 withdrawal or complications of withdrawal: 13 Concomitant use of other addictive substances 14 Positive blood alcohol concentration in the presence of signs and symptoms of withdrawal 15 Signs or symptoms of a co -occurring psychiatric disorder are active and reflect a moderate level 16 of severity 17 Recommendation II.7: Patients' risk for compl icated withdrawal or complications of withdrawal is 18 increased by the presence of multiple risk factors. 19 Recommendation II.8: In general, clinicians may consider patients at risk of severe or complicated 20 withdrawal if they are experiencing at least moderat e alcohol withdrawal on presentation (e.g., CIWA -Ar 21 score 10). 22 C. Risk Assessment Tools 23 Recommendation II.9: Clinicians can consider the use of a tool such as The ASAM Criteria Risk 24 Assessment Matrix to assess a patient's risk of severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal as well as 25 potential complications of withdrawal . 26 Recommendation II.10: The following scale s can be helpful for assessing for the risk of severe alcohol 27 withdrawal: 28 Prediction of Alcohol Withdrawal Severity Scale (PAWSS) 29 Luebeck Alcohol -Withdrawal Risk Scale (LARS) 30 D. Symptom Assessment Scale s 31 Recommendation II.11: A validated scale should be used to assess alcohol withdrawal severity . 32 Recommendation II.12: Assess the risk for scores on a n alcohol withdrawal severity assessment scale to 33 be confounded by causes other than alcohol withdrawal. If risk factors are present, interpret the results of 34 scales with caution. Use a scale that relies more on objective signs of withdrawal (autonomic activity) if a 35 12 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY patient has difficulty communicating about their sympto ms. See Appendix III for the features of different 1 scales. 2 Recommendation II.13: A validated withdrawal severity assessment scale can be used as part of risk 3 assessment. A high initial score can indicate risk of developing severe or complicated withdrawal , 4 although scores should not be the only information used to predict patient risk. 5 E. Identify Concurrent Conditions 6 Recommendation II.14: When assessing for concurrent medical conditions, screen patients for medical 7 conditions that could affect the cours e of alcohol withdrawal or treatment of alcohol withdrawal, as well 8 as common chronic conditions that are associated with alcohol use disorders. 9 Recommendation II.15: A pregnancy test should be obtained for women of childbearing potential. For 10 managing pre gnant patients, see VII.F . Patients who are Pregnant . 11 Recommendation II.16: In settings with access to laboratory tests, clinicians should conduct and/or 12 arrange for a comprehensive metabolic profile (CMP) or basic metabolic profile (BMP), a hepatic panel, 13 and a complete blood count with differential to assess a patient's electrolytes, liver functioning, renal 14 functioning , and immune functioning. In a setting with limited access to laboratory testing, clinicians 15 should obtain results when practical to assist with treatment planning decisions. Address any nutritional 16 deficiencies detected. 17 Initial screening may also include laboratory tests for: 18 Hepatitis 19 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (with consent) 20 Tuberculosis 21 Recommendation II.17: Assess patients for polysubstance use and be prepared to treat other potential 22 withdrawal syndromes. To assess a patient's other substance use, it may be helpful to: 23 Use a validated scale that addresses other substance use, such as the Alcohol, Smoking and 24 Substance Involveme nt Screening Test (ASSIST) 25 Conduct a urine or other toxicology test to detect other substance use 26 Utilize information from collateral sources when possible (i.e., family and friends) 27 Recommendation II.18: Do not delay the initiation of treatment if alcohol withdrawal is suspected but 28 laboratory test results are not available at the treatment setting or the results are pending. 29 Recommendation II.19: Assess patients for concurrent mental health conditions, including a review of 30 their mental health hist ory, to determine their mental health treatment needs. Consult with any mental 31 health professionals caring for such patients. Obtain written or verbal consent before consultation 32 whenever possible in non -emergent situations. The Patient Health Questionnair e (PHQ -9) and the 33 Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD -7) scales can be helpful to screen for mental health disorders. Be 34 cautious when diagnosing a new primary mental health disorder during acute withdrawal, as it can be 35 difficult to differentiate between su bstance -induced signs and symptoms and primary psychiatric 36 disorders. 37 Recommendation II.20: Evaluate active suicide risk as part of the initial patient assessment. 38 13 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY III. Level of Care Determination 1 A. General Approach 2 Recommendation III.1: Level of care determination should be based on a patient's current signs and 3 symptoms; level of risk for developing severe or complicated withdrawal or complications o f withdrawal ; 4 and other dimensions such as recovery capital and environment. Alcohol withdrawal can typically be 5 safely managed in an ambulatory setting for those patients with limited or mitigated risk factors. Patients 6 with low levels of psychosocial support or an unsafe environment may benefit from a more intensive level 7 of care than is otherwise indicated. 8 Recommendation III.2: Patients with active risk of suicide should be treated in a setting equipped to 9 manage patients at risk of suicide, which often necessitates admission to an inpatient psychiatric setting 10 that also provides withdrawal management services. 11 B. Level of Care Determination Tools 12 Recommendation III.3: The ASAM Criteria Risk Assessment Matrix and withdrawal severity scales can 13 be helpful for determining the appropriate level of care for managing patients in alcohol withdrawal. Most 14 withdrawal severity scale s reflect current signs and symptoms and should not be used alone to determine 15 level of care. 16 C. Considerations for Ambulatory vs Inpatient Management 17 Recommendation III.4 : See Table 2. Ambulatory (Level 1 -WM and Level 2 -WM) and Inpatient 18 Placement Considerations on p. 60. 19 IV. Ambulatory Management of Alcohol Withdrawal 20 A. Monitoring 21 Recommendation IV.1: In ambul atory settings, arrange for patients to check in with a qualified health 22 provider (e.g., medical assistant, nurse) daily for up to five days following cessation of (or reduction in) 23 alcohol use. For some patients who are unable to attend daily in -person ch eck-ins, alternating in -person 24 visits with remote check -ins via phone or video call is an appropriate alternative. 25 Recommendation IV.2: Re-assessments should focus on the patient's health since the last checkup. 26 Clinicians should assess general physical c ondition, vital signs, hydration, orientation, sleep and 27 emotional status including suicidal thoughts at each visit. Ask about alcohol and other substance use and, 28 if available, measure Blood Alcohol Content ( BAC ) with a breathalyzer to detect recent alcohol use. 29 Recommendation IV.3: Alcohol withdrawal severity should be monitored with a validated instrument 30 (see Appendix III for a summary of scale and their associated features). Patients who are able to monitor 31 14 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY their own signs and symptoms may use an instrument designed for self -administration such as the Short 1 Alcohol Withdrawal Scale (SAWS). 2 Recommendation IV.4: In ambulatory settings, patients with a current or past benzodiazepine use 3 disorder need additional mo nitoring. 4 Recommendation IV.5: For patients managed in an ambulatory setting, the following indications would 5 necessitate transfer to a more intensive level of care such as Level 2 -WM (if in a Level 1 -WM setting) or 6 an inpatient setting: 7 Agitation or severe tremor has not resolved despite having received multiple doses of medication, 8 and the patient will not be continually monitored (e.g., treatment setting is closing) 9 More severe signs or symptoms develop such as persi stent vomiting, marked agitation, 10 hallucinations, confusion , or seizure 11 Existing medical or psychiatric conditions worsen 12 Patient appear s over-sedated 13 Patient return s to alcohol use 14 Syncope, unstable vital signs (low /high blood pressure , low/high heart rate ) 15 B. Supportive Care 16 Recommendation IV.6: Supportive care is a critical component of alcohol withdrawal management. 17 Providers should ensure patients are educated about what to expect over the course of with drawal, 18 including common signs and symptoms and how they will be treated. 19 Recommendation IV.7: When treating patients in ambulatory settings, providers should ensure 20 patients/caregivers are educated about monitoring for the development of more severe withd rawal and 21 instructed to create a low -stimulation, reassuring environment at home to promote an effective outcome. 22 Recommendation IV.8: Patients should be advised to drink non -caffeinated fluids and that a daily 23 multivitamin may be beneficial. 24 Recommendati on IV.9: Patients can be offered oral thiamine. Typical dosing is 100 mg PO per day for 25 3-5 days. 26 Recommendation IV.10: Clinicians must explain the importance of taking medications as prescribed and 27 confirm the patient's understanding. 28 Recommendation IV.1 1: Communicate that safe alcohol withdrawal management may necessitate a 29 transfer to a more intensive level of care including to an inpatient setting and secure the patient's 30 agreement to transfer if there are indications that management in the ambulatory setting is not safe or 31 effective. See Recommendation IV.5 for indications for transfer t o a more intensive level of care. 32 C. AUD Treatment Initiation and Engagement 33 Recommendation IV.12: When feasible, alcohol use disorder (AUD) treatment should be initiated 34 concurrently with alcohol withdrawal management as cognitive status permits. If appro priate , clinicians 35 should offer to initiate pharmacotherapy for AUD as cognitive status permits. If not initiating AUD 36 treatment themselves, clinicians should explain the range of evidence -based treatment services av ailable 37 15 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY in the community , and engage patients with these options. In addition, clinicians may offer information 1 about local recovery support groups, including 12 -step groups. 2 D. Pharmacotherapy 3 (1) Prophylaxis 4 Recommendation IV.13: Patients at risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal or 5 complications of alcohol withdrawal may be treated in ambulatory settings at the discretion of providers 6 with extensive experi ence in management of alcohol withdrawal. Such patients should be provided with 7 preventative pharmacotherapy . Benzodiazepines are first -line treatment because of their well -documented 8 effectiveness in reducing the si gns and symptoms of withdrawal including the incidence of seizure and 9 delirium. Phenobarbital is an appropriate alternative in a Level 2 -WM setting for providers experienced 10 with its use. For patients with a contraindication for benzodiazepine use, phenoba rbital (in Level 2 -WM 11 settings by providers experienced with its use) or transfer to a more intensive level of care are appropriate 12 options. 13 Recommendation IV.14: A front loading regimen is recommended for patients at high risk of severe 14 withdrawal syndrome. Providing at least a single dose of preventative medication is appropriate for 15 patients at lower levels of risk who have: 16 A history of severe or complicated withdrawal 17 An acute medical, psychiatric , or surgical illness 18 Severe coronary artery disease 19 Displaying signs or symptoms of withdrawal concurrent with a positive blood alcohol content 20 Recommendation IV.15: Patients at risk of developing new or worsening signs or symptoms of 21 withdrawal while away from the ambulatory treatment setting should be provided with pharmacotherapy . 22 Some indications of risk include a history of withdrawal episodes of at least moderate severity and being 23 within the window for the development of symptoms in the time course of withdrawal. Benzodiazepines, 24 carbamazepine , or gabapentin are all appropriate options for monotherapy . Providing at least a single dose 25 of benzodiazepine followed by ongoing treatment according to symptom severity is also appropriate. If 26 the risk of developing worse withdrawal is unknown, patients should be reassessed frequently over the 27 next 24 hours to monitor their need for withdrawal medication. 28 (2) Withdrawal symptoms 29 Recommendation IV.16: Patients experiencing mild alcohol withdrawal (e.g., CIWA -Ar score <10) wh o 30 are at minimal risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal or complications of alcohol 31 withdrawal may be provided pharmacotherapy or supportive care alone. If providing medication, 32 carbamazepine or gabapentin are appropriate options. For patients who are at risk of developing new or 33 worsening withdrawal while away from the treatment setting, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine , or 34 gabapentin are appropriate. 35 Recommendation IV.17: Patients experiencing moderate alcohol withdrawal (e.g., CIWA -Ar scores 10 - 36 18) should receive pharmacotherapy . Benzodiazepines are first -line treatment. Carbamazepine or 37 gabapentin are appropriate alternatives. For patients with a contraindication for benzodiazepine use, 38 carbamazepine, gabapentin , or phenobarbi tal (in Level 2 -WM settings for provider s experienced with its 39 16 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY use) are appropriate. Carbamazepine, gabapentin , or valproic acid (if no liver disease or childbearing 1 potential) may be used as an adjunct to benzodiaze pines. 2 Recommendation IV.18: Patients experiencing severe , but not complicated , alcohol withdrawal (e.g., 3 CIWA -Ar 19) may be treated in ambulatory Level 2 -WM settings at the discretion of providers with 4 extensive experience in management of alcohol withdrawal. Such patients should receive 5 pharmacotherapy . Benzodiazepines are first -line treatment. Phenobarbital is an appropriate alternative for 6 providers experienced with its use. For patients with a contraindication for benzodiazepine use, 7 phenobarbital, carbamazepine , or gabapentin are appropriate. The use of adjunct medications is also 8 appropriate. 9 Recommendation IV.19: If a patient is taking medication as prescribed and symptoms are not controlled 10 as expected: 11 First, consider increasing the dose 12 If over -sedation or inadequate monitoring is a concern: 13 Reassess for appropriate level of care 14 Consider switching medications 15 If using benzodiazepines, consider adding an adjunct medication 16 (3) Benzodiazepine use 17 Recommendation IV.20: While no particular benzodiazepine agent is more effective than anothe r, 18 longer -acting benzodiazepines are the preferred agents due to the clinical benefits of their longer duration 19 of action. 20 Recommendation IV.21: If waiting for lab test(s) results or if the test(s) are unavailable, if a patient has 21 signs of significant li ver disease, use a benzodiazepine with less hepatic metabolization. 22 Recommendation IV.22: Clinicians should monitor patients taking benzodiazepines for signs of over - 23 sedation and respiratory depression. 24 Recommendation IV.23: A benzodiazepine prescription to treat alcohol withdrawal should be 25 discontinued following treatment. 26 Recommendation IV.24: Clinicians can manage benzodiazepine misuse or diversion risk in ambulatory 27 settings by dispensing or prescribing the minimum amount necessary given patients' level of stability and 28 timing of their next in -person clinic visit. Alternative medications can also be considered such as 29 carbamazepine or gabapentin. 30 Recommendation IV.25: In ambulatory settings, benzodiazepines should not be prescribed to pati ents 31 with a history of even mild adverse events with benzodiazepine use because rapid intervention is not 32 typically available . Benzodiazepines can be used with caution in patients with a high risk of 33 benzodiazepine diversion including patients with a curre nt or past benzodiazepine use disorder for the 34 short period of acute alcohol withdrawal. Risk can be managed by dispensing or prescribing a small 35 number of doses . 36 Recommendation IV.26: Patients who are taking benzodiazepines, and their caregivers, should b e 37 educated regarding: 38 The danger of drug -drug interactions between benzodiazepines and other CNS depressants 39 (impairment and respiratory depression) 40 17 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The risks associated with combining alcohol and benzodiazepines and importance of abstinence 1 from alcohol 2 The risks associated with driving or use of heavy machinery for the first few days of 3 benzodiazepine administration 4 Instructions to reduce their benzodiazepine dose if drowsiness occurs 5 (4) Benzodiazepine dosing regimens 6 Recommendation IV.27: At short -term observational settings with continuous monitoring (e.g. Level 2 - 7 WM) , symptom -triggered treatment conducted by trained staff is the preferred benzodiazepine dosing 8 method. Front loading while under clinical supervision or fixed dosing with additional as -needed 9 medication are also appropri ate. 10 Recommendation IV. 28: At settings without extended on -site monitoring (Level 1 -WM) , symptom - 11 triggered dosing is appropriate if patients or a caregiver can reliably monitor signs and symptoms with a 12 withdrawal severity scale and follow dosing guidance. Otherwise, front loading while under clinical 13 supervision or fixed dosing with additional as -needed medication is appropriate. 14 Recommendation IV.29 : Front loading is recommended for patients experiencing severe alcohol 15 withdrawal (e.g., CIWA -Ar 19) . Diazepam and chlordiazepoxide are preferred agents for front loading . 16 Recommendation IV. 30: When using a fixed -dose schedule, patients' signs and symptoms should still 17 be monitored . A few additional take -home doses can be provided to take as needed. When initiating a 18 fixed -dose regimen , arrange for the patient to be follow up with the following day to modify the dose if 19 needed. 20 Recommendation IV. 31: If prescribing a shorter -acting benz odiazepine, using a fixed -dose regimen with 21 a gradual taper may be appropriate to reduce the likelihood of breakthrough and rebound signs and 22 symptoms. 23 (5) Carbamazepine, gabapentin, valproic acid 24 Recommendation IV. 32: Gabapentin is a favorable choice for treating alcohol withdrawal when a 25 clinician also plans to use it for a patient's ongoing treatment of alcohol use disorder. 26 Recommendation IV. 33: If benzodiazepines are contraindicated, carbamazepine or gabapentin are Recommendation IV. 34: Carbamazepine, gabapentin , or valproic acid may be used as an adjunct to 29 benzodiazepine therapy to help control alcohol withdrawal. Before using as an adjunct, clinici ans should 30 ensure that an adequate dose of benzodiazepine has been administered. 31 Recommendation IV. 35: Valproic acid should not be used in patients who have liver disease or women 32 of childbearing potential. 33 Recommendation IV. 36: There is insufficient evide nce to support the use of valproic acid as 34 monotherapy for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal. 35 18 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (6) Phenobarbital 1 Recommendation IV. 37: Phenobarbital can be used for some patients in Level 2 -WM ambulatory 2 settings; however, it should only be used by clinicians experienced with its use given its narrow 3 therapeutic window and side effects. 4 Recommend ation IV. 38: In a Level 2 -WM ambulatory setting (e.g., with extensive monitoring) , 5 phenobarbital monotherapy (managed by a clinician experienced with its use ) is an appropriate alternative 6 to benzodiazepines for patients who are experiencing severe alcohol withdrawal or who are at risk of 7 developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal or complication of alcohol withdrawal . 8 Recommendation IV. 39: In a Level 2 -WM ambulatory setting (e.g., with extensive monitoring) , 9 phenobarbital monotherapy (managed by a clinician experienced with its use ) is appropriate for patients 10 with a contr aindication for benzodiazepine use who are experiencing moderate or severe alcohol 11 withdrawal or who are at risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol wi thdrawal or complication s of 12 alcohol withdrawal . 13 (7) A2AAs and (A2AAs) such as clonidine can be used as an 15 adjunct to benzodiazepine therapy to control autonomic hyperactivity and anxiety when symptoms are not 16 controlled by benzodiazepines alone. They should not be used alone to prevent or treat withdrawal -related 17 seizures or delirium. 18 Recommendation IV.4 1: Beta-adrenergic antagonists (beta -blockers) can be used as an adjunct to 19 benzodiazepines in select patients for control of persistent hypertension or tachycardia when these signs 20 are not controlled by benzodiazepines alone. T hey should not be used to prevent or treat alcohol 21 withdrawal seizures. 22 (8) Inappropriate medications 23 Recommendation IV.4 2: Oral or intravenous alcohol should not be used for the prevention or treatment 24 of alcohol withdrawal. 25 Recommendation IV.4 3: There is insufficient evidence to support the use of baclofen for the treatment 26 of alcohol withdrawal. 27 Recommendation IV.4 4: Providing magnesium as a prophylaxis or treatment for alcohol withdrawal 28 management has no supporting evidence. 29 V. Inpatient Management of Alcohol Withdrawal 30 A. Monitoring 31 Recommendation V.1: The following monitoring schedule is appropriate: 32 In patients wi th moderate to severe withdrawal or those requiring pharmacotherapy , re-assess 33 every 1 -4 hours for 24 hours, as clinically indicated. Once stabilized (e.g., CIWA -Ar score < 1 0 34 for 24 hours), monitoring can be extended to every 4 -8 hours for 24 hours, as clinically indicated. 35 19 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Patients with mild withdrawal and low risk of complicated withdrawal may be observed for up to 1 36 hours, after w hich more severe withdrawal is unlikely to develop. 2 Recommendation V.2: Monitor patients' vital signs, hydration, orientation, sleep, and emotional status 3 including suicidal thoughts. 4 Recommendation V.3: Monitor patients receiving pharmacotherapy for alcohol withdrawal for signs of 5 over-sedation and respiratory depression. 6 Recommendation V.4: Signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal should be monitored during 7 withdrawal management with a validated assessment scale (see Appendix III for a summary of scale s and 8 their associated features). 9 B. Supportive Care 10 Recommendation V.5: Supportive care is a critical component of alcohol withdrawal management. 11 Frequent reassurance, re -orientation to time and place, and nursing care are recommended non - 12 pharmacological interventions. Providers should ensure patients are educated about what to expect over 13 the course of withdrawal, including common signs and symptoms and how they will be treated. Patients 14 with severe alcohol withdrawal should be cared for in an evenly lit, quiet room. Patients should be offered 15 hope and the expectation of recovery. 16 Recommendation V.6: Supportive care for alcohol withdrawal patients includes adherence to safety 17 measures and protocols (e.g., assess risk for fall/syncope). If available and applicable, exis ting 18 institutional/hospital -associated delirium protocols can be used for supportive care of patients with severe 19 alcohol withdrawal. 20 Recommendation V.7: Thiamine should be provided to prevent Wernicke encephalopathy. 21 Intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) administration of thiamine is preferred, in particular for 22 patients with poor nutritional status, malabsorption, or who are known to have severe 23 complications of alcohol withdrawal. 24 Typical dosing is 100 mg IV/IM per day for 3 -5 days. Oral thiamine also can also be offered . 25 Patients also receiving glucose can be administered thiamine and glucose in any order or 26 concurrently. 27 Recommendation V.8: Clinicians should administer thiamine to patients admitted to the Intensive Care 28 Unit (ICU) to treat alcohol wit hdrawal. 29 Recommendation V.9: For patients with hypomagnesemia, cardiac arrhythmias, electrolyte disturbances, 30 or a previous history of alcohol withdrawal seizures, magnesium should be administered. 31 Recommendation V.10: If phosphorus is <1 mg/dL, supplement ation should be provided. Otherwise, in 32 the case of moderate hypophosphatemia (1 -2 mg/dL), correction through proper nutrition is 33 recommended. 34 Recommendation V.11: In patients who are critically ill, folate supplementation may be considered, 35 since chronic alcohol use is associated with hyperhomocysteinemia. 36 20 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY C. AUD Treatment Initiation and Engagement 1 Recommendation V.12: The period of alcohol withdrawal management should be used to engage 2 patients with an alcohol use disorder (AUD) with comprehensive treatme nt. When feasible, AUD 3 treatment should be initiated concurrently with alcohol withdrawal management as cognitive status 4 permits. If appropriate, clinicians should also offer to initiate pharmacotherapy for AUD as co gnitive 5 status permits. Clinicians should explain the range of evidence -based treatment services available at the 6 current site and in the community. Finally, clinicians should proactively connect patients to treatment 7 services as seamlessly as possible, in cluding initiating a warm handoff to treatment providers. 8 D. Pharmacotherapy 9 (1) Prophylaxis 10 Recommendation V.13: For patients at risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal or 11 complications of alcohol withdrawal , preventative pharmacotherapy should be provided. Benzodiazepines 12 are first -line treatment because of their well -documented effectiveness in reducing the signs and 13 symptoms of with drawal including the incidence of seizure and delirium. For patients with a 14 contraindication for benzodiazepine use, phenobarbital can be used by providers experienced with its use . 15 In settings with close monitoring, phenobarbital adjunct to benzodiazepines is also appropriate. 16 Recommendation V.14: A front loading regimen is recommended for patients at high risk of severe 17 withdrawal syndrome. Providing at least a single dose of preventative medication is appropriate for 18 patients at lower levels of risk not experiencing significant signs or symptoms but have: 19 A history of severe or complicated withdrawal 20 An acute medical, psychiatric , or surgical illness 21 Severe coronary artery disease 22 Displaying signs or symptoms of withdrawal concurrent with a positive blood alcohol content 23 (2) Withdrawal symptoms 24 Recommendation V.15: For patients experiencing mild alcohol withdrawal (e.g., CIWA -Ar score <10) 25 who are at minimal risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal or complications of 26 alcohol with drawal , pharmacotherapy or supportive care alone may be provided. If providing medication, 27 benzodiazepines, carbamazepine , or gabapentin are appropriate. For patients with traindication for 28 benzodiazepine use, carbamazepine , gabapentin , or phenobarbital (for providers with use), 29 are appropriate. Carbamazepine, gabapentin , or valproic acid ( if no liver disease or childbearing potential) 30 may be used as an adjunct to benzodiazepines. 31 Recommendation V.16: Patients experiencing moderate alcohol withdrawal (e.g., CIWA -Ar scores 10 - 32 18) should receive pharmacotherapy . Benzodiazepines are first -line treatment. Carbamazepine or 33 gabapentin are appropriate alternatives. For patients with a contraindication for benzodiazepin e use, 34 carbamazepine, gabapentin , or phenobarbital ( for provider s experienced with its use) are appropriate. 35 Carbamazepine, gabapentin , or valproic acid (if no liver disease or childbearing potential) may be used as 36 an adjunct to benzodiazepines . 37 Recommendation V.17: Patients experiencing severe alcohol withdrawal (e.g., CIWA -Ar scores 19) 38 should receive pharmacotherapy . Benzodiazepines are first -line treatment. For patients with a 39 21 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY contraindication for benzodiazepine use, phenobarbital is appropriate for providers are experienced with 1 its use. If close monitoring is av ailable, phenobarbital can be used as an adjunct to benzodiazepine s. Other 2 adjunct medications can be considered after a clinician ensures that an adequate dose of benzodiazepines 3 has been administered. 4 Recommendati on V.18: If a patient's symptoms are not controlled as expected: 5 First consider increasing the dose 6 If over -sedation or inadequate monitoring is a concern: 7 Reassess for appropriate level of care 8 Consider switching medic ation 9 If using benzodiazepines, consider adding an adjunct medication 10 (3) Benzodiazepine use 11 Recommendation V.19: While no particular benzodiazepine agent is more effective than another, longer - 12 acting benzodiazepine s are the preferred agents due to clinical benefits of their longer duration of action. 13 Recommendation V.20: If waiting for lab test(s) results or if the test(s) are unavailable, if a patient has 14 signs of significant liver disease, use a benzodiazepine with less hepatic metabolization. 15 Recommendation V.21: Clinicians should monitor patients taking benzodiazepine s for signs of over - 16 sedation and respiratory depression. 17 Recommendation V.22: A benzodiazepine prescription to treat alcohol withdrawal should be 18 discontinued following treatment. 19 (4) Benzodiazepine dosing regimens 20 Recommendation V.23: Symptom -triggered treatment preferred benzo diazepine dosing method. 21 Fixed dosing according to a scheduled taper may be appropriate if symptom -triggered treatment cannot be 22 used. 23 Recommendation V.2 4: Front l oading is recommended for patients experiencing severe alcohol 24 withdrawal (e.g., CIWA -Ar scores 19). Diazepam or chlordiazepoxide are preferred agents for front 25 loading . 26 Recommendation V.2 5: When using a fixed -dose schedule, patients' signs and symptoms should still be 27 monitored, and additional doses of medication provided as needed. 28 Recommendation V.2 6: If prescribing a shorter -acting benzodiazepine, using a fixed -dose regimen with 29 a gradual taper may be appropriate to reduce the likelihood of breakthrough and rebound signs and 30 symptoms. 31 (5) Carbamazepine, gabapentin, valproic acid 32 Recommendation V. 27: Gabapentin is a fav orable choice for treating alcohol withdrawal when a 33 clinician also plans to use it for a patient's ongoing treatment of alcohol use disorder. 34 Recommendation V. 28: If benzodiazepines are contraindicated, carbamazepine or gabapentin are 35 appropriate alternat ives for patients in mild or moderate withdrawal . 36 22 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Recommendation V. 29: Carbamazepine, gabapentin , or valproic acid may be used as an adjunct to 1 benzodiazepine therapy to help control alcohol withdrawal. Before using as an adjunct, clinicians should 2 ensure that an adequate dose of benzodiazepine has been administered. 3 Recommendation V.3 0: Valproic acid should not be used in patients who have li ver disease or women of 4 childbearing potential. 5 Recommendation V.3 1: There is insufficient evidence to support the use of valproic acid as 6 monotherapy for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal. 7 (6) Phenobarbital 8 Recommend ation V. 32: Phenobarbital can be used for some patients in inpatient settings; however, it 9 should only be used by clinicians experienced with its use given its narrow therapeutic window and side 10 effects. 11 Recommendation V.3 2: In an inpatient setting, phenobarbital monotherapy (managed by a clinician 12 experienced with its use) is appropriate for patients with a contraindication for benzodiazepine use who 13 are experiencing mild, moderate, or severe alcohol withdrawal or who are at risk of developing severe or 14 complicated alcohol withdrawal or com plications of alcohol withdrawal . 15 Recommendation V.3 4: In an inpatient setting, if close monitoring is available, phenobarbital (managed 16 by a clinician experienced with its use) as an adjunct to benzodiazepines is an option for pat ients 17 experiencing severe alcohol withdrawal or who are at risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol 18 withdrawal or complications of alcohol withdrawal . 19 Recommendation V.3 5: Parenteral phenobarbital should only be used in highly supervised settings (e.g., 20 ICU, CCU) because of risk of over -sedation and respiratory depression. 21 (7) A2AAs and clonidine and can 23 be used as an adjunct to benzodiazepine therapy to control autonomic hyperactivity and anxiety when 24 these signs are not c ontrolled by benzodiazepines alone. They should not be used alone to prevent or treat 25 withdrawal -related seizures or delirium. 26 Recommendation V.3 7: Beta-adrenergic antagonists (beta -blockers) can be used as an adjun ct to 27 benzodiazepines in select patients for control of persistent hypertension or tachycardia when these signs 28 are not controlled by benzodiazepines alone. They should not be used to prevent or treat alcohol 29 withdrawal seizures. 30 (8) Inappropriate medications 31 Recommendation V.3 8: Oral or intravenous alcohol should not be used for the prevention or treatment 32 of alcohol withdrawal. 33 Recommendation V. 39: There is insufficient evidence to support the use of baclofen for the treatment of 34 alcohol withdrawal. 35 Recommendat ion V.4 0: Providing magnesium as a prophylaxis or treatment for alcohol withdrawal 36 management has no supporting evidence. 37 23 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY VI. Addressing Complicated Alcohol Withdrawal 1 A. Alcohol Withdrawal Seizure 2 (1) Monitoring 3 Recommendation VI.1: Patients should be monitored for alcohol withdrawal seizures even in the 4 absence of other clinically prominent alcohol withdrawal signs or symptoms. 5 Recommendation VI.2: Following an alcohol withdrawal seizure, patients should be admitted to a 6 setting wi th close monitoring available, and should be re -assessed every 1 -2 hours for 6 -24 hours. Patients 7 should be closely monitored for delirium and the need to receive intravenous (IV) fluids, due to potential 8 electrolyte imbalances. 9 (2) Supportive care 10 Recomm endation VI.3: If available and applicable, existing institutional/hospital -associated delirium 11 protocols can be used for supportive care of patients with an alcohol withdrawal seizure. 12 (3) Pharmacotherapy 13 Recommendat ion VI.4: Following a withdrawal seizure, patients should be immediately treated with a 14 medication effective at preventing another seizure. Benzodiazepines are first -line treatment, and a fast - 15 acting agent such as lorazepam or diazepam is preferred. Phenob arbital is also an option but is less 16 preferred to benzodiazepines. 17 Recommendation VI.5: Following a withdrawal seizure, parenteral administration of medications is 18 preferred. If available, IV administration is preferred to intramuscular (IM), but IM admi nistration is also 19 effective. Parenteral phenobarbital should only be used in highly supervised settings (e.g., Intensive Care 20 Unit [ICU] , CCU) because of risk of over -sedation and respiratory depression. 21 Recommendation VI.6: It is not recommended to use alpha2 -adrenergic agonists or beta-adrenergic 22 antagonists to prevent or treat alcohol withdrawal seizures because they are ineffective for this purpose. 23 Beta-adrenergic antagonists also can lower the seizure threshold. Phenytoin should not be used unless 24 treating a concomitant underlying seizure disorder. 25 B. Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium 26 (1) Monitoring 27 Recommendation VI.7: Patients with alcohol withdrawal delirium should be provided close nursing 28 observation and supportive care , which often necessitates admission to an intensive or critical care unit. 29 Agitated and disoriented patients should have continuous, one -to-one observation and monitoring. 30 Recommendation VI.8: Patients with alcohol withdrawal delirium should have their vital signs, 31 oximetry and cardiac status monitored as frequently as required. Resuscitative equipment should be 32 readily available when patients require high doses of benzodiazepines, when continuous infusi on of 33 medication is used, or when patients have significant concurrent medical conditions. 34 24 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Recommendation VI.9: To monitor signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal delirium, use a structured 1 assessment scale such as the Confusion Assessment Method for ICU Patients (CAM -ICU), Delirium 2 Detection Score (DDS), Richmond Agitation -Sedation Scale (RASS) , or Minnesota Detoxification Scale 3 (MINDS). It is not recommended to use the CIWA -Ar in patients with delirium because it relies on 4 patient -reported symptoms. 5 (2) Supportive care 6 Recommendation VI.10: Provide immediate intravenous access for administration of drugs and fluids to 7 patients experiencing alcohol withdrawal delirium. 8 Recommendation VI.11: If available and applicable, existing institutional/hospital -associated delirium 9 protocols can be used for supportive care of patients with alcohol withdrawal delirium. 10 Recommendation VI.12: Restraints should only be used when required to prevent injuries due to 11 agitation or viole nce, and in compliance with state laws. 12 (3) Pharmacotherapy 13 Recommendation VI.13: Patients with alcohol withdrawal delirium should be sedated to achieve and 14 maintain a light somnolence. Benzodiazepines are recommended as the first -line agents for managing 15 alcohol withdrawal delirium. 16 Recommendation VI.14: When available, medication should be administered intravenously. The use of 17 intermittent IV administration of long - and short -acting medications is acceptable and effective. 18 Continuous IV infusion is cons iderably more expensive and there is no evidence of therapeutic 19 superiority. 20 Recommendation VI.15: Patients receiving repeated high intravenous doses of lorazepam or diazepam 21 should be monitored closely for signs of hyponatremia and metabolic acidosis. 22 Recommendation VI.16: When treating alcohol withdrawal delirium, use an established dosing protocol 23 as a guide, but individualize dosing regimens based on patient's signs and symptoms. It is appropriate for 24 patients with alcohol withdrawal delirium to recei ve intravenous symptom -triggered or fixed -dose front 25 loading . Once light somnolence is achieved and patients are calm and cooperative, if on IV medication, 26 shifting to oral symptom -triggered treatment is recommended. 27 Recommendation VI.17: Very large doses of benzodiazepines may be needed to control agitation in 28 alcohol withdrawal delirium, including doses that are much higher than typically seen in other patient 29 populations. Clinicians should not hesitate to provide such large doses to pat ients to control agitation but 30 should keep in mind the possible risk of over -sedation and respiratory depression. Moreover, when large 31 doses are used, there is risk of accumulation of long -acting benzodiazepine metabolites, especially in 32 patients with impa ired hepatic function or the elderly, and patients should be monitored closely. 33 Recommendation VI.18: For patients who have been delirious longer than 72 hours, assess for drug - 34 induced delirium and withdrawal from another GABAergic agent (such as gabapentin or carisoprodol). 35 When necessary, adjust the benzodiazepine dose. 36 Recommendation VI.19: Barbiturates can be considered an alternative option to benzodiazepines for the 37 treatment of alcohol withdrawal delirium, but they are not preferred to benzodiazepines. Phenobarbital 38 25 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY can be used as an adjunct to benzodiazepines in settings with close monitoring when alcohol withdrawal 1 delirium is not adequately controlled by benzodiazepine therapy alone. 2 Recommendation VI.20: Antipsychotic agents can be used as an adjunct to benzodiazepines when 3 alcohol withdrawal delirium and hallucinations are not adequately controlled by benzodiazepine therapy 4 alone. They are not recommended as monotherapy for alcohol withdrawal delirium. 5 Recommendation VI. 21: Alpha2 -adrenergic agonists, beta-adrenergic antagonists and paraldehyde 6 should not be used to treat alcohol withdrawal delirium. 7 C. Alcohol -Induced Psychotic Disorder 8 Recommendation VI.22: If available and applicable, existing institutional/hospital -associated delirium 9 protocols can be used for supportive care of patients with an alcohol -induced psychotic disorder . 10 Recommendation VI.23: The treatment of alcohol -induced psychotic disorder may require consultation 11 with a psychiatrist. 12 Recommendation VI.24: The treatment of alcohol -induced psychotic disorder may require addition of 13 antipsychotics. 14 Recommendation VI.25: For patients experiencing hallucinations, diazepam may be considered a 15 treatment option. 16 D. Resistant Alcohol Withdrawal 17 Recommendation VI.26: If available and applicable, existing institutional/hospital -associated delirium 18 protocols can be used for supportive care of patients with resistant alcohol withdrawal . 19 Recommendation VI.27: Phenobarbital may be used as an adjunct to benzodiazepines to control resistant 20 alcohol withdrawal syndrome in settings with close monitoring. 21 Reco mmendation VI.28: Propofol may be used with patients in the ICU experiencing resistant alcohol 22 withdrawal who already require mechanical ventilation. 23 Recommendation VI.29: Dexmedetomidine may be used with patients in the ICU exper iencing resistant 24 alcohol withdrawal . 25 VII. Specific Settings and Populations 26 A. Primary Care 27 Recommendation VII.1: If patients are experiencing severe withdrawal (e.g., CIWA -Ar scores 19), 28 refer them directly to the nearest Emergency Department. 29 Recommendation VII.2: If withdrawal is mild (e.g., CIWA -Ar <10), patients presenting to primary care 30 can be prescribed a few do ses of benzodiazepine . Whenever possible, medication can be supervised by a 31 26 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY caregiver at home or staff at a nonmedical withdrawal management center. Do not prescribe medication to 1 patients for ambulatory management of alcohol withdrawal without performing an adequate assessment or 2 to patients without adequate support. 3 Recommendation VII.3: If withdrawal does not resolve (e.g., fall below a CIWA -Ar score of 10) after 4 an adequate dose of medication (e.g., 80 mg diazepam), or patients appears sedated, transfer to an 5 Emergency Department or other inpatient withdrawal management setting. 6 Recommendation VII.4: For patients treated in primary care settings, regular follow -up visits, at least 7 monthly for one year, could increase the likelihood of sustained recovery . 8 B. Emergency Departments 9 Recommendation VII.5: If patients are experiencing severe alcohol withdrawal (e.g., CIWA -Ar 19), or 10 are at risk of complicated withdrawal, administer medication immediately to treat with drawal and reduce 11 the risk of seizures and delirium. 12 Recommendation VII.6: Patients presenting with alcohol withdrawal syndrome in the Emergency 13 Department should be evaluated for delirium as well as other conditions that mimic and/or accompany 14 withdrawal. Patients presenting with delirium should be assessed for all potential etiologies including 15 alcohol withdrawal. 16 Recommendation VII.7: Patients in the Emergency Department should receive a complete blood count 17 and complete metabolic panel including liver enzyme and magnesium tests; alcohol withdrawal treatment 18 should not be delayed while waiting for results. 19 Recommendation VII.8: The following indicators should be present for discharge to an ambulatory 20 alcohol withdrawal management setting from the Emergency Department: 21 Mild alcohol withdrawal (e.g., CIWA -Ar score <10). 22 Moderate alcohol withdrawal (e.g., CIWA -Ar score 10 -18) with no other complicating factors 23 Not currently intoxicated (including alcohol or other drugs) 24 No history of complicated alcohol withdrawal (seizures, delirium) 25 No significant medical or psychiatric comorbidities that would complicate withdrawal 26 management 27 Able to comply with ambulatory visits and therapy 28 Recommendation VII.9: Patients with controlled withdrawal syndrome being discharged from the 29 Emergency Department may be of fered a short term (e.g., 1 -2 day) prescription for appropriate alcohol 30 withdrawal medication to last until follow -up with their healthcare provider. 31 C. Hospitalized Patients 32 (1) Identification 33 Recommendation VII.10: All patients admitted to the hospital should be screened for risk of alcohol 34 withdrawal. Among hospitalized patients, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and 35 Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test -Piccinelli Consumption ( AUDIT -PC) can indicate risk of 36 developing alcohol withdrawal. 37 27 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Recommendation VII.11: Patients undergoing elective surgery should be screened for unhealthy alcohol 1 use and the need to undergo alcohol withdrawal management be fore proceeding with surgery. Patients 2 undergoing elective surgery who are at risk of alcohol withdrawal should undergo medically managed 3 withdrawal before proceeding with surgery 4 (2) Assessment 5 Recommendation VII.12: Among hospitalized patients, the Pred iction of Alcohol Withdrawal Severity 6 Scale (PAWSS) can be used for predicting risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal 7 in the medically ill. 8 Recommendation VII.13: Patients for whom alcohol withdrawal is suspected and for whom a complet e 9 medical history is not available, (i.e., are admitted from the Emergency Department or trauma unit, are in 10 Intensive Care Unit [ICU] ), or who are known to be at high risk of complicated alcohol withdrawal, 11 medical decisions should be oriented toward a mo re aggressive treatment of alcohol withdrawal 12 regardless of presenting signs and symptoms. 13 Recommendation VII.14: For patients who requir e more than standard amounts of medication to 14 manage alcohol withdrawal , individualized assessment by clinician s exper ienced in the management of 15 withdrawal is recommended . The medication and protocol used for treating other conditions and/or 16 alcohol withdrawal syndrome may need to be modified. 17 (3) Monitoring 18 Recommendation VII.15: In patients who are hospitalized, monitor their vital signs. Fluid intake and 19 output and serum electrolytes should be monitored as clinically indicated. 20 Recommendation VII.16: Signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal should be monitored during the 21 course of withdrawal with a validated symptom assessment scale. Assess the risk for scores on a symptom 22 assessment scale to be confounded by the use of certain medications, the presence of certain medical 23 conditions (e.g. fever from infection), or a patient's dif ficulty communicating. Among general 24 medical/surgical patients, low withdrawal scores can typically be interpreted with confidence, while high 25 scores should be interpreted with caution. The use of alternative scales with patients with difficulty 26 communicat ing is appropriate. 27 Recommendation VII.17: Patients with a reduced level of consciousness who are at risk for the 28 development of alcohol withdrawal should be monitored for the appearance of alcohol withdrawal signs. 29 If a co -occurring clinical condition wor sens, do not assume it is related to alcohol withdrawal among 30 alcohol withdrawal patients. However, immediate treatment is required if alcohol withdrawal develops 31 after surgery or trauma. 32 (4) Supportive care 33 Recommendation VII.18: Clinicians should admini ster thiamine to ICU patients with signs or symptoms 34 that mimic or mask Wernicke encephalopathy. 35 (5) Pharmacotherapy 36 Recommendation VII.19: Prophylactic treatment of alcohol withdrawal should be provided in the ICU 37 to patients who are suspected to be physiologically dependent on alcohol. 38 28 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Recommendation VII.20: Implementing an alcohol withdrawal management protocol in the ICU is 1 appropriate. When using a symptom -triggered dosing protocol, use a validated scale to monitor signs and 2 symptoms. For patients being treated in ICU settings for alcohol withdrawal, existing scales that are 3 appropriate to u se for monitoring withdrawal include the Richmond Agitation -Sedation Scale (RASS). 4 Administration of medications via the intravenous route is preferred because of the rapid onset of action 5 and more predictable bioavailability. 6 D. Patients with Medical Con ditions 7 Recommendation VII.21: For patients with medical comorbidities , modify the m edication and/or 8 protocol used for treating alcohol withdrawal syndrome as necessary in consultation with other 9 specialists. 10 Recommendation VII.22: For patients with medica l conditions that prevent the use of oral medication, 11 provide intravenous or intramuscular medications as necessary. 12 Recommendation VII.23: Aggressive withdrawal treatment is indicated for patients with cardiovascular 13 disorders due to risk of harm associated with autonomic hyperactivity. 14 Recommendation VII.24: For patients with a medical condition associated with impaired hepatic 15 function, adjust medication dose or use medications with less dependence on hepatic metabolism. 16 E. Patients who Take Opio ids 17 Recommendation VII.25: Patients who are on chronic opioid medication (opioid agonist therapy for 18 opioid use disorder or pain) should be monitored closely when benzodiazepines are prescribed, due to the 19 increase d risk of respiratory depression. Similarl y, patients taking sedative -hypnotic medications exhibit 20 tolerance to benzodiazepines and should be monitored closely for appropriate dose. 21 Recommendation VII.26: For patients with concomitant alcohol withdrawal and opioid use disorder, 22 stabilize opioid u se disorder (e.g. , with methadone or buprenorphine) concomitantly with treating alcohol 23 withdrawal. 24 F. Patients who are Pregnant 25 (1) Level of care and monitoring 26 Recommendation VII.2 7: Inpatient treatment should be considered for all pregnant patients wit h alcohol 27 use disorder who require withdrawal management. Inpatient treatment should be offered to pregnant 28 patients with at least moderate alcohol withdrawal (i.e., CIWA -Ar scores 10). 29 Recommendation VII.2 8: The CIWA -Ar is an appropriate symptom assessment scale to use with 30 pregnant patients. Clinicians should consider signs and symptoms such as nausea, headache, anxiety, and 31 insomnia to be connected to alcohol withdrawal rather than pre gnancy that will abate once the alcohol 32 withdrawal has been effectively treated. 33 Recommendation VII. 29: During withdrawal management, consult with an obstetrician . 34 29 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (2) AUD treatment initiation and engagement 1 Recommendation VII.3 0: Engagement in treatment for AUD is particularly important for pregnant 2 patients with alcohol withdrawal given the risk of Spectrum Disorder (FASD ) including Fetal Alcohol 3 Syndrome (FAS) . ) 4 (3) Pharmacotherapy 5 Recommendation VII.3 1: Before giving any medications to pregnant patie nts, ensure that patients 6 understand the risks and benefits of the medication, both for the patient and the developing fetus. 7 Recommendation VII.3 2: Benzodiazepines and barbiturates are the medications of choice in treatment 8 of pregnant patients with alcoh ol withdrawal. While there is a risk of teratogenicity during the first 9 trimester, the risks appear small, and they are balanced in view of the risk for fetal alcohol spectrum 10 disorder and consequences to mother and fetus should severe maternal alcohol wit hdrawal develop. 11 Recommendation VII.3 3: Due to the high teratogenic risk, valproic acid is not recommended for 12 pregnant patients. 13 Recommendation VII.3 4: For patients at risk for pre -term delivery or in the late third trimester, use of a 14 short -acting benzodiazepine is recommended. This minimizes the risk for neonatal benzodiazepine 15 intoxication given shorter onset and duration of action. 16 (4) Newborn consid erations 17 Recommendation VII.3 5: In cases of alcohol withdrawal treated close to delivery, assess the newborn 18 for benzodiazepine intoxication, sedative withdrawal, and Spectrum Disorder (FASD) including Fetal 19 Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) . 20 Recommendation VII.3 6: Inform pregnant patients of all wraparound services that will assist them in 21 addressing newborn needs, including food, shelter, pediatric clinics for inoculations, as well as programs 22 that will help with developmental or physical iss ues that the newborn may experience as a result of in - 23 utero substance exposure. 24 Recommendation VII.3 7: Licensed clinical staff have an obligation to understand and follow their state 25 laws regarding definitions of child abuse and neglect, reporting require ments, and plans of safe care for 26 newborns with in -utero alcohol exposure. 27 30 INTRODUCTION Introduction 1 I. Purpose 2 The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) developed this Guideline on Alcohol Withdrawal 3 Management to provide updated information on evidence -based strategies and standards of care for 4 alcohol withdrawal management in both ambulatory and inpatient settings. 5 II. Background 6 Alcohol is responsible for a multitude of health conditions, including Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and 7 alcohol withdrawal. Individuals physical ly depende nt on alcohol may experience signs and symptoms of 8 alcohol withdrawal upon cessat ion of (or reduction in) alcohol use, due to the sudden reversal of 9 depressant effects on brain function. Signs and s ymptoms of alcohol withdrawal include anxiety, sleep 10 disturbance, headache , nausea, hallucinations, delirium, and seizures. Clinical signs include sweating, 11 elevated blood pressure, tachycardia, hyperthermia, and hyperactive reflexes. Hallucinations can range 12 from mild perceptual distortions to frank hallucinations with a lack of insight. The most severe 13 consequences of alcohol withdrawal inc lude seizure, delirium, and death. 14 Patients with alcohol withdrawal frequently present in specialty addiction treatment settings and general 15 medical settings . Patients experiencing or at risk for developing alcohol withdrawal also present in 16 hospitals, em ergency departments, and primary care settings. An estimated 2 -7% of patients with heavy 17 alcohol use admitted to the hospital will develop moderate to severe alcohol withdrawal .16 Additionally, 18 an estimated 60% of emergency department visits are alcohol related .17 Many of these patients will 19 develop alcohol withdrawal during their emergency department stay. 20 There is an extensive body of research on the management of alcohol withdrawal, much of which has 21 focused on pharmacotherapy . However, due to the evolution of research evidence and clinical practice, 22 questions continue to emerge about the appropriate management of patients with alcohol withdrawal. For 23 example, although benzodiazepines have long b een considered the mainstay of alcohol withdrawal 24 treatment, research on other agents such as anticonvulsants have raised clinical questions about 25 alternatives or adjuncts to benzodiazepines. Similarly, although the Clinical Instrument Withdrawal 26 Assessment for Alcohol , Revised (CIWA -Ar) has long been considered the standard assessment scale for 27 patients with alcohol withdrawal, several other instruments have been developed, raising questions about 28 the value of a give n instrument as compared to the others. Finally, although researchers have primarily 29 focused on alcohol withdrawal management in inpatient settings, clinical practice has evolved and 30 treatment in outpatient settings has become increasingly common. Therefor e, numerous clinical questions 31 have emerged about which patients are appropriate for ambulatory alcohol withdrawal management as 32 well as how to tailor treatment interventions to specific settings. 33 A. Need for a New Guideline 34 In June 2017, the American Soc iety of Addiction Medicine's (ASAM) Quality Improvement Council 35 (QIC) elected to update ASAM's clinical guidelines on alcohol withdrawal management based on several 36 31 INTRODUCTION factors. First, ASAM conducted an Educational Needs Assessment in 2016 that showed a strong interest 1 and need for education on withdrawal management. Second, updated QIC policies recommend that all 2 ASAM guidelines should be updated every five years. ASAM's previous guidelines on the topic of 3 alcohol withdrawal management were published in 1997 a nd 2004. The first guideline, \"Pharmacological 4 Management of Alcohol Withdrawal\"13 was published in JAMA , followed five years later with the most 5 recent guideline entitled \"Management of Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium\"14 in JAMA, formerly Archives 6 of Internal Medicine. Subseq uent guidelines have not been written since the 2004 guidelines thus an 7 update was due. Third, the American Psych iatric Association (APA) release d a guideline on medications 8 to treat alcohol use disorder that does not cover withdrawal management.15 An ASAM guideline on 9 alcohol withdrawal should complement APA's guideline. Fourth, outreach to other organizations 10 indicated that other organizations are not planning to create a guideline on alcohol withdrawal. 11 Although alcohol withdrawal has been recognized for centuries and effective treatment strategies have 12 been researched for decades, questions remain about effective approaches to treatment in specialty and 13 non-specialty settings. At the outset of the guideline devel opment process, ASAM identified several 14 practice concerns related to alcohol withdrawal treatment: 15 1. Uncertainty about the CIWA -Ar, which is the most widespread symptom monitoring instrument 16 but may not fit all patient populations and settings 17 2. Excessive cau tion about the use of benzodiazepines to treat alcohol withdrawal, which have been 18 shown to prevent seizures and delirium 19 3. The use of barbiturates, which have a much narrower therapeutic window than benzodiazepines 20 4. Inconsistent treatment practices in non -specialty settings 21 The new clinical guideline is intended to address some of these current practice concerns and provide 22 clear guidance that will lead to more consistent treatment practices in the field. 23 B. Previous ASAM Guidelines 24 This clinical practice guideline will replace the two previous ASAM guidelines related to alcohol 25 withdrawal management, \"Pharmacological Ma nagement of Alcohol Withdrawal\"13 in 1997 and 26 \"Management of Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium\"14 in 2004. 27 The 1997 guideline was based on a literature review conducted in 1995 and was primarily focused on 28 pharmacotherapy , with minimal attention to psychosocial treatment and considerations for various 29 settings and levels of care. The 2004 guideline focuses on a specific aspect of alcohol withdrawal 30 management: delirium, one of the most serious manifestations of alcohol withdrawal. This included a 31 review and meta -analysis of nine prospective controlled trials pub lished through 2001. 32 C. Additional ASAM Guidelines and Standards 33 ASAM has produced several other documents that provide guidance on the management of alcohol 34 withdrawal, the most relevant of which are The ASAM Criteria ,12 Principles of Addiction Medicine ,18 and 35 the ASAM Standards of Care .19 36 The ASAM Criteria provides comprehensive guidance on withdrawal management , specifically 37 address ing alcohol withdrawal , including clear instruction for assessing and determining the patient's 38 32 INTRODUCTION level of risk , matching patient s to the appropriate level of care , and the service characteristics that should 1 be present each level of care for withdrawal management . 2 Principles of Addiction Medicine contains a chapter titled \"Manage ment of Alcohol Intoxication and 3 Withdrawal,\" which reviews the clinical presentation and management of alcohol intoxication and 4 withdrawal. 5 The ASAM Standards of Care provides a list of principles for Addiction Specialist Physicians to follow in 6 order to support quality improvement activities and improve patient outcomes. The Standards \"outline a 7 minimum standard of physician performance and should not be construed as describing the totality of care 8 that a person with addiction might require.\"19(p 5) The Standards help physicians identify their clinical and 9 administrative roles to improve overall functioning and well -being of patient s, while integrating addiction 10 treatment into the larger healthcare system. Standards are organized by six performance measure 11 domains . One of the six domains includes withdrawal management. 12 III. Scope of Guideline 13 While the current clinical guideline focuses pr imarily on alcohol withdrawal management, it is important 14 to underscore that alcohol withdrawal management alone is not an effective treatment for alcohol use 15 disorder. Withdrawal management should not be conceptualized as a discrete clinical service, but rather 16 as a component in the process of initiating and engaging patients in treatment for alcohol use disorder. 17 IV. Intended Audience 18 The intended audience of this guideline is clinicians, mainly physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician 19 assistants, who provide alcohol withdrawal management in specialty and non -specialty addiction 20 treatment settings (including primary care and emergency departments, intensive care and surgery units in 21 hospitals). The guideline will also have utility for administrators, in surers, and policymakers. 22 V. Qualifying Statement 23 This ASAM Alcohol Withdrawal Management Guideline is intended to aid clinicians in their clinical 24 decision making and patient management. The Guideline strives to identify and define clinical decision 25 making j unctures that meet the needs of most patients in most circumstances. Clinical decision making 26 should involve consideration of the quality and availability of expertise and services in the community 27 wherein care is provided. In circumstances in which the Gu ideline is being used as the basis for regulatory 28 or payer decisions, improvement in quality of care should be the goal. Finally, courses of treatment 29 contained in recommendations in this Guideline are effective only if the recommendations, as outlined, 30 are followed. Because lack of patient understanding and adherence may adversely affect outcomes, 31 clinicians should make every effort to promote the patient's understanding of, and adherence to, 32 prescribed and recommended treatments. Patients should be inform ed of the risks, benefits, and 33 alternatives to a particular treatment, and should be an active party in shared decision making whenever 34 feasible. Recommendations in this Practice Guideline do not supersede any federal or state regulation s. 35 33 INTRODUCTION VI. Special Terms 1 Different terms have been used to describe various aspects and management methods of acohol 2 withdrawal. Below are terms that are used throughout the guideline used to convey a specific meaning for 3 the purposes of this guideline . 4 Alcohol Hallucinosis/Alcohol -induced Psychotic Disorder: Hallucinations that are not associated with 5 alcohol withdrawal delirium and which can occur in the absence of other clinically prominent withdrawal 6 signs and symptoms. Hallucinosis is characterized primarily by auditory hallucinations, paranoid 7 symptoms and fear. Hallucinations occur in clear consciousness, are generally third person auditory 8 hallucinations, and often derogatory. There may be secondary delusions or perseveration as well.20 It is 9 unclear if alcohol hallucinosis is part of alcohol withdrawal or if the hallucinations are a complication of 10 chronic alcohol use unrelated to withdrawal. Currently, alcohol hallucinosis is diagnosed as alcohol - 11 induced psychotic di sorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5 (DSM -5). 12 Ambulatory Withdrawal Management: Withdrawal management that occurs in outpatient settings, 13 including primary care and intensive outpatient/day hospital settings. Level of clinical expertise and 14 frequency of monitoring vary widely within various ambulatory withdrawal management settings. 15 Delirium and seizure: Unless otherwise specified, in this document these refer to alcohol withdrawal - 16 related seizure or alcohol withdrawal delirium. Alcohol withd rawal delirium has replaced the formerly 17 used \"delirium tremens.\" 18 Dosing regimens: Different terms have been used to describe the many variations in dosing regimens 19 used in alcohol withdrawal management. This document focuses on the following regimen types (see 20 Appendix V for specific examples) 21 Symptom -triggered dosing: An approach whereby patient s are monitored through the use of a 22 structured assessment scale and given medication only when symptoms cross a threshold of 23 severity (e.g., 25 -100 mg chlordiazepoxide if CIWA -Ar score 10). Symptom -triggered dosing 24 can be further refined by giving a diffe rent dose amount depending on the individual's score (e.g., 25 15 mg oxazepam for CIWA -Ar scores 8 -15, 30 mg oxazepam for CIWA -Ar >15). The score can 26 also determine the frequency of reassessment and further dosing. 27 Fixed dosing: In a fixed -dose regimen, a pre determined dose is administered at fixed intervals 28 according to a schedule. Doses usually decrease in a gradual taper over several days. A fixed - 29 dose schedule can be refined by choosing an initial dose according to withdrawal severity as 30 assessed by a with drawal symptom severity scale.21 When fixed -doses are given, allowances 31 should be made to provide additional medication if the fixed -dose should prove inadequate to 32 control symptoms. 33 Front loading: An appro ach to dosing wherein moderate -to-high dose s of a long -acting agent 34 (e.g., 20 mg of diazepam) are given frequently at the outset of treatment to achieve rapid control 35 of withdrawal signs and symptoms . The medication level is allowed to taper through metabolism. 36 Front loading can be driven by a symptom assessment scale (e.g., 20 mg of diazepam every hour 37 until CIWA -Ar scores <10) or a fixed -dosing schedule (e.g., 20 mg of diazepam every hour for 1 - 38 2 hours or until patient is sedated) . 39 Inpatient Withdra wal Management: Alcohol withdrawal management that occurs in inpatient settings, 40 including hospitals. The defining feature of inpatient settings for the purposes of this document is that 41 patients are on site 24/7. Level of clinical expertise and frequency of monitoring vary widely within 42 34 INTRODUCTION various inpatient withdrawal management settings. For the purposes of this document, residential 1 facilities without continual medical monitoring are considered inpatient settings. 2 Level of care (LOC): Used in this guideline to describe different settings for the management of alcohol 3 withdrawal, based on the definitions laid out in The ASAM Criteria .12 The ASAM Criteria defines specific 4 levels of care for alcohol withdrawal management as follows: 5 Level 1 -WM: Ambulatory withdrawal management without extended on -site monitoring 6 Level 2 -WM: Ambulatory withdrawal management with extended on -site monitoring 7 Level 3.2 -WM: Clinically managed residential withdrawal management 8 Level 3.7 -WM: Medically monitored inpatient withdrawal management 9 Level 4 -WM: Medically managed intensive inpatient withdrawal management 10 However, this guideline also uses two broad categories to describe settings where the management of 11 alcohol withdrawal may take place. The first is an ambulatory level of care, which encompasses Level 1 - 12 WM and Level 2 -WM. The second is an inpatient level of care, which encompasses Level 3 -WM and 13 Level 4 -WM. Inpatient care also includes hospital settings. There is considerable variation in the staffing 14 and resource availability within these two broad categories, which clinicians should consider when 15 applying this guideline to their specific treatment setting. 16 Resistant alc ohol withdrawal (RAW): Used in this guideline to describe patients experiencing severe or 17 complicated alcohol withdrawal signs and symptoms despite having received high doses of 18 benzodiazepines. There is not yet agreement in the field regarding the precise amount of benzodiazepines 19 required before considering a patient to be in RAW, but various studies have used the cutoff of 200 mg 20 diazepiam in 4 hours,22 40 mg intravenous diazepam in 1 hour,22 or 50 mg intravenous d iazepam in 1 21 hour.23 This phenomenon is also referred to as Refractory Alcohol Withdrawal, Benzodiazepine -resistant 22 Alcohol Withdrawal and Treatment -resistant Alcohol Withdrawal in other sources. 23 Severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal or complications of alcohol withdrawal : These terms are 24 used independently or jointly in this guideline to describe certain signs and symptoms and/or risk s 25 associated with alcohol withdrawal that are most harmful to patients . They are defined as: 26 Complicated alcohol withdrawal: The development of alcohol withdrawal -related seizures or 27 alcohol withdrawal delirium (see Table 1. Alcohol Withdrawal Severity ) 28 Severe alcohol withdrawal: Severe but not complicated signs and symptoms of alcohol (see Table 29 1. Alcohol Withdrawal Severity ) 30 Complications of alcohol withdrawal: Alcohol withdraw al signs and symptoms' potentially life - 31 threatening exacerbation of existing medical or psychiatric conditions 32 35 INTRODUCTION Withdrawal severity: In this guideline, withdrawal severity is categorized in the table below . 1 Table 1. Alcohol Withdrawal Severity 2 Severity Category Associated CIWA -Ar Range* Symptom Description Mild CIWA -Ar < 10 Mild or moderate anxiety, sweating and insomnia, but no tremor Moderate CIWA -Ar 10-18 Moderate anxiety, sweating, insomnia, and mild tremor Severe CIWA -Ar 19 Severe anxiety and moderate to severe tremor, but not confusion, hallucinations, or seizure Complicated CIWA -Ar 19 Seizure or signs and symptoms indicative of delirium - such as an inability to fully comprehend instructions, clouding of the sensorium or confusion - or new onset of hallucinations * Throughout this document, we provide examples for withdrawal severity using the CIWA -Ar, although other scales can be used. Regardless of the instrument used, there is a wide variety in the literature and in practice as to which scores best delineate mild, moderate and severe withdrawal. Classification of withdrawal severity is ultimately up t o the judgment of clinicians and the choice of reference range may be based on their particular patient population or capabilities . 3 36 APPROACH & METHODOLOGY Approach and Methodology 1 I. Overview of Approach 2 In order to develop a comprehensive practice guideline focused on alcohol withdrawal management, we 3 utilized a hybrid of established methodologies. In order to develop the scope of the guideline and draft the 4 guideline statements, we followed the Veterans Health Administration and Department of Defense 5 (VA/DoD) Guideline for Guidelines. To rate and refine the draft guidelines, we used the RAND/UCLA 6 Appropriateness Method (RAM), which is a specific process for combining the available scientific 7 evidence with the clinical judgment of experts. Quality of the literature reviewed was rated using 8 standardized rating scales and methodology. The external review process was informed by the VA/DoD 9 method. 10 ASAM's Quality Improvement Council (QIC) was the oversight committee during the development of 11 the alcohol withdrawal management guideline. The QIC originally chose two Clinical Champions to have 12 a key role in accordance with the VA/DoD model of clinical p ractice guideline development. An 13 additional two Clinical Champions were added to the project to represent ambulatory settings. The 14 Clinical Champions have a deep knowledge of alcohol withdrawal management and a familiarity with the 15 clinical language and d ecision making processes involved in this procedure. Additionally, the QIC chose 16 a nine -member Guideline Committee to rate guideline statements. Panel members were selected to 17 represent a diverse spectrum of clinical practitioners who manage alcohol withdr awal. The QIC also 18 recruited a Guideline Committee Moderator to act as a liaison between the Guideline Committee 19 members and the project team and to lead the discussion during an in -person meeting of the Guideline 20 Committee. 21 In selecting the panel members , the QIC made every effort to avoid actual, potential, or perceived 22 conflicts of interest that might arise as a result of relationships with industry and other entities among 23 members of the project personnel. All QIC members, Guideline Committee members, and external 24 reviewers of the document were required to disclose all current related relationships, which are 25 summarized in Appendix VII. 26 II. Develop the Scope and Key Questions 27 The QIC was responsible for identifying the guideline scope and intended audience. The Clinical 28 Champions refined the scope by identifying the key clinical questions of greatest importance to the 29 management of alcohol withdrawal. The key questions followed the Population, Intervention, 30 Comparison, Outcome, Time and Setting (PICOTS) frame work established by the AHRQ.24 Indicators of 31 interest in the PICOTS model are listed below: 32 Population - The target population was adults 18 years or older with a diagnosis of alcohol 33 withdrawal with or without other health conditions. The management of these other conditions, 34 outside of identification and routine prophylaxis in the context of alcohol withdra wal, were not 35 included, such as alcoholic liver disease and Wernicke encephalopathy. 36 Intervention - Pharmacological and non -pharmacological interventions were included. 37 Pharmacotherapies that are not widely available in the United States were excluded (e.g ., sodium 38 37 APPROACH & METHODOLOGY oxybate [GHB] , cannabinoids, chlomethiazole). Off -label medications for alcohol withdrawal 1 management were included. Non -pharmacological interventions included supportive care, 2 nutritional correction, and symptom monitoring and assessment frequen cy. 3 Comparison - All comparative interventions were included if they met criteria for an included 4 intervention. 5 Outcome - Outcomes of interest were those clinical outcomes most consequential and immediate 6 to withdrawal including severity of withdrawal synd rome ; treatment completion; transfer to more 7 intensive level of care; incidence of seizure, delirium, death and adverse events; and linkage to 8 long-term AUD treatment. 9 Time - The duration of time of interest was 5 days from the start of withdrawal. Post -acute 10 prolonged withdrawal or protracted withdrawal was not included. The Clinical Champions 11 identified protracted withdrawal and benzodiazepine -resistant withdrawal as an area that should 12 be included in the future. 13 Setting - All clinical settings were inclu ded except for home management of withdrawal unless it 14 took place in the United States. 15 After a face -to-face meeting of the Guideline Committee, feedback indicated that settings and levels of 16 care had not been adequately delineated in the initial set of dr aft statements. This was largely due to the 17 sparse literature specific to ambulatory settings and the focus of our Clinical Champions on the more 18 moderate -severe end of the spectrum of alcohol withdrawal. Therefore, after the initial Guideline 19 Committee Me eting, the project was expanded to place additional focus on considerations specific to 20 alcohol withdrawal management in ambulatory settings. The expanded literature review and drafting of 21 additional statements particular to ambulatory settings are describ ed below. 22 III. Conduct a Literature Review 23 A systematic literature review including the indicators identified by the Clinical Champions was 24 conducted. The literature review included all levels of published research literature, including studies with 25 non-random assignment and case studies. A targeted internet search of gray literature was also conducted, 26 including published and unpublished clinical guidelines on alcohol withdrawal management. 27 Procedures for review of the academic literature followed PRISMA guide lines for systematic reviews.25 28 Articles were identified through searches conducted in four bibliographic databases us ing pre -defined 29 search terms and selection criteria. Additional articles were identified through forward and reverse 30 citation search of key articles. All databases were searched uniquely. 31 Searches were conducted for the time -period January 2012 to October 2017 using the following key 33 psychotic disorder.\" These terms also captured studies on alcohol withdrawal delirium and alcohol 34 withdrawal seizure. Beca use clinical management encompasses topics from diagnosis to treatment, we did 35 not include search terms for management and instead relied on the screening process to parse useful from 36 peripheral sources. The databases searched were EBSCOhost Medline, Embas e, Web of Science Core 37 Collection, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). Searches targeted 38 all text fields and were restricted to availability in English and to human participants where available 39 (Medline and Embase). If an article contained a secondary analysis of data from a relevant study, the 40 primary source was included. 2,038 unique records were found. Results of the key term search are 41 documented in Appendix II. 42 38 APPROACH & METHODOLOGY In addition to the systematic search, targeted title and abstract searches were conducted without a time - 1 period limitation on key clinical questions identified by the Clinical Champions. These topics included: 2 withdrawal symptom severity rating scales, comparison of benzodiazepine dose regimens, comparisons 3 among benzodiazepines, comparison of benzodiazepines to anticonvulsants and barbiturates. An 4 additional 70 records were identified. This method was also used to conduct a targeted search of 5 ambulatory management of alcohol withdrawal. 6 In addition to the scientific literature search, we conducted an internet search for published clinical 7 guidelines or appropriateness statements on alcohol withdrawal management across settings following the 8 IOM process for searching gray literature. The f ollowing websites were searched using the on -site search 9 engines with the search terms \"alcohol\" and \"substance abuse\": SAMHSA, VA, WHO, AHRQ, Michigan 10 Quality Improvement Consortium. This search was not time -limited, but where recommending bodies had 11 published updates of guidelines, only the most recent was included. The search yielded 115 records, 11 of 12 which were screened for inclusion. The full search procedure is documented in Appendix II . 13 Two independent reviewers screened article abstracts and the fu ll text of articles for inclusion. Articles 14 were included if they were about the clinical management of patients with or at immediate risk for 15 developing alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Reasons for exclusion are documented in Appendix II . 16 The quality of the e vidence represented by each research article was rated by two independent reviewers; 17 systematic reviews and other qualitative articles were rated by one reviewer. Comparative trials were 18 evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Systematic reviews we re rated using the AMSTAR -2. 19 Other qualitative articles were evaluated using the AACODS Checklist for Grey Literature. Study 20 methods and results were extracted by two independent reviewers. A document summarizing the findings 21 of the literature review and t he quality of sources used was prepared for the Guideline Committee 22 Members to refer to during the statement rating process. Sources were included in the summary document 23 if they were randomized controlled trials ( RCT )s, systematic reviews of RCTs, or guid elines based on 24 systematic reviews. In the absence of such evidence, lower quality evidence sources were included. 25 IV. Develop Draft Guideline Statements 26 In order to develop the draft statements, a meeting was held with the project team, Clinical Champions, 27 and ASAM/QIC representatives. The list of statements identified the different combinations of clinical 28 indicators in various clinical situations seen in alcohol withdrawal management. A list of definitions for 29 terms used in the statements was also developed. 30 V. Conduct Panel R atings 31 The RAM method involves multiple rounds of rating and a face -to-face meeting between the project team 32 and Guideline Committee. The first round of ratings was conducted remotely. Members of the committee 33 received rating instructions, background material, and the list of potential guideline statements in 34 electronic form. Committee members were asked to consider the appropriateness of each statement 35 individually on a 1 -9 scale using the literature review and evidence tables as well as t heir own best 36 clinical judgment. 37 Shortly after members of the Guideline Committee received rating materials, the Guideline Committee 38 Moderator contacted each member individually to gather feedback about the guideline which could not be 39 39 APPROACH & METHODOLOGY well captured within the rating form. This opportunity was to seek comments on the general structure and 1 organization of the guideline as well as suggested modifications. 2 Returned Guideline Committee ratings were aggregated and analyzed by IRETA staff. The RAM offers 3 specifi c guidance for the analysis and classification of guideline statements: a statement is deemed 4 appropriate if the median rating is in the 7 -9 range, and no more than one -third of the experts rate the 5 statement outside that range. A statement is deemed inapp ropriate if the median rating is in the 1 -3 range 6 and no more than one -third of the committee rate outside this range. All other statements (those with a 7 median rating of 4 -6 or with at least one -third of the experts rating the statement outside the median 8 range) are labeled uncertain. 9 A two -day in -person Guideline Committee meeting took place in the D.C. area. Prior to this meeting, 10 committee members received the list of guideline statements with the Round 1 rating results indicated for 11 each statement; th eir own rating, the group median rating, and the frequency of each rating response. 12 Discussion was led by the Guideline Committee Moderator and focused on statements labeled uncertain. 13 The discussion aimed to identify whether the rating results reflected t rue uncertainty or disagreement in 14 the field versus confusion about the statement's meaning. Qualitative feedback from the Round 1 ratings 15 and individual feedback from IRETA's personal contacts also informed the Guideline Committee meeting 16 discussion, in a ccordance with the RAM. Statements could be rewritten if the uncertainty was found to be 17 due to confusion. New statements could also be drafted if any important clinical aspects were found to be 18 missing by the Guideline Committee . 19 The second round of ratings was conducted remotely soon after the meeting. The list of uncertain 20 statements, with the addition of new statements suggested during the meeting, were delivered in 21 electronic form to the committee members . The committee members rated the guideline statements using 22 the same criteria as the first round, considering the appropriateness of each statement. This second round 23 of ratings were then aggregated and analyzed by IRETA staff. 24 One Guideline Committee member dropped out of par ticipating after the Guideline Committee meeting. 25 This necessitated finding a new method of identifying agreement that does not rely on group sizes that are 26 multiples of three. The RAM manual recommends alternatives, and the Interpercentile Range Adjusted 27 for Symmetry (IPRAS) method was used for the remainder of the project. 28 At this point, the project expansion took place. The other parts of the project were paused, while the 29 project team conducted an expanded literature review focused on ambulatory conside rations in alcohol 30 withdrawal management. An additional two Clinical Champions representing ambulatory settings were 31 recruited and new statements were drafted and rated in two rounds. A second meeting of the Guideline 32 Committee was hel d remotely via webina r. The project expansion started in August 2018, and by May 33 2019, we were able to return to the original (although modified) timeline. 34 In a third round of ratings, committee members rated the agreed -upon appropriate statements from 35 Rounds 1 and 2 on a 1 -9 scale using the more stringent criterion of necessity. Appropriateness refers to 36 procedures where the health benefits sufficiently outweigh potential harms such that the procedure is 37 worth doing. Necessity refers to procedures that must be offered to pati ents fitting a particular clinical 38 description, where it would be improper not to offer the procedure given the magnitude and likelihood of 39 the expected benefit to the patient. A statement is deemed necessary if the median rating is in the 7 -9 40 range with a greement according to IPRAS. Statements that do not meet these criteria are deemed 41 appropriate but not necessary. 42 40 APPROACH & METHODOLOGY VI. Drafting the Guideline Document 1 Recommendations were drafted by the project team by combining the statements identified as clinically 2 appropriate by the Guideline Committee. Recommendations are accompanied by a brief discussion of the 3 evidence or rationale for the statement. ASAM's two prior alcohol withdrawal guidelines were used as an 4 initial framework for the guideline. Thi s first draft of the guideline was reviewed by the Clinical 5 Champions, Guideline Committee Moderator and Guideline Committee Members to ensure content 6 clarity and logical flow of the guideline. A second draft was produced based on this feedback. 7 During an external review process, ASAM requested feedback on the second draft guideline via email to 8 the ASAM listserv and also posted the draft for public comment on the ASAM website . At the end of the 9 review period, ASAM aggregated the feedback, identified key issues raised, and tracked proposed 10 changes. A two -day in -person meeting including ASAM staff, QIC representatives, the expert panel 11 moderator and IRETA took place in Pittsburgh , PA to discuss all of the external review feedback and 12 proposed edits . Feedback was incorporated as appropriate in discussion with those in attendance and in 13 accordance with the evidence . IRETA then produced the Final Guideline Document. 14 41 IDENTIFICATION AND DIAGNOSIS Recommendations 1 I. Identification and Diagnosis of Alcohol Withdrawal 2 A. Identification 3 Recommendation I.1: Incorporate universal screening for unhealthy alcohol use into medical settings 4 using a validated scale to help identify patients with or at risk for alcohol use disorder and alcohol 5 withdrawal. 6 Recommendation I.2: For patients known to be using alcohol recently, regularly, and heavily, assess 7 their risk of developing alcohol withdrawal even in the absence of signs and symptoms (see II. Initial 8 Assessment for risk factors and risk assessment scales ). 9 Recommendation I.3: For patients who have signs and symptoms suggestive of alcohol withdrawal, 10 assess the quantity, frequency , and time of day when alcohol wa s last consumed to determine whether the 11 patient is experiencing or is at risk for developing alcohol withdrawal. For this assessment, it may be 12 helpful to: 13 Use a scale that screens for unhealthy alcohol use (e.g., Alcohol Use Disorders Identification 14 Test-Piccinelli Consumption [AUDIT -PC]) 15 Use information from collateral sources (i.e., family and friends) 16 Conduct a laboratory test that provides some measure of hepatic function 17 Recommendation I.4: A biological test (blood, breath, or urine) for alcohol use may be helpful for 18 identifying recent alcohol use , particularly in patients unable to communicate or otherwise gi ve an alcohol 19 use history . When conducting a biological test, consider the range of time (window of detection) in which 20 the test can detect alcohol use. Do not rule out the risk of developing alcohol withdrawal if the result of a 21 test is negative. 22 Discussi on 23 Identifying the presence of or risk for alcohol withdrawal may begin with discovering that a patient has 24 been consuming alcohol recently, heavily and regularly. This recognition can be aided by implementing 25 universal screening for unhealthy alcohol use . Universal screening for unhealthy alcohol use is a 26 recommended primary prevention practice that identif ies patients with unhealthy alcohol use and 27 increases early interven tion in the development of alcohol -related health conditions and complications, 28 including alcohol withdrawal. This practice has been endorsed by the U.S. Preventive Services Task 29 Force (USPSTF) and is supported by an extensive evidence base .4,26-29 Unfortunately , universal screening 30 for unheal thy alcohol use has not been widely implemented in medical settings . As of the release of the 31 USPSTF recommendation statement in 2018, it was estimated that only 1 out of 6 patients have ever 32 discussed alcohol use with their physician .30 33 Screening begins with administering a brief, standard assessment to identify patients' unhealthy alcohol 34 use, usually by assessing the amount and frequency of their recent consumption . Based on the results, 35 patients may be identified as at -risk for develop ing alcohol withdrawal syndrome if they have recently (or 36 plan to ) stopped or significantly reduce d their alcohol consumption. Standard assessments for unhealthy 37 42 IDENTIFICATION AND DIAGNOSIS alcohol use that have been used as an initial screen to identify patients at risk of alcohol w ithdrawal 1 include t he Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT ),31 CAGE ,32 and Alcohol Use Disorders 2 Identification Test -Piccinelli Consumption (AUDIT -PC).29,33 For example, i n a retrospective case -control 3 study of over 400 hospitalized patients, an initial AUDIT -PC score 4 identified patients who developed 4 alcohol withdrawal during their stay with 91% sensitivity and 90% specificity .29 5 For patients who present with signs and symptoms suggestive of alcohol withdrawal, these screening 6 instruments can also be helpful in assessing the amount and frequency of recent alcohol consumption. 7 Screening for unhealthy alcohol use also is relevant for identification of and treatment planni ng for AUD. 8 Clinicians may also gain additional information about a patient's recent alcohol use from other sources 9 including friends and family.4 10 Laboratory tests that measure impairment of hepatic functioning such as the liver enzymes gamma - 11 glutamyl transferase (GGT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) can identify recent heavy alcohol use 12 and hence risk for alcohol withdrawal . When using a urine te st, GGT is recommended as the marker of 13 heavy alcohol consumption .34 Clinicians should be aware that laboratory tests provide only partial 14 information relevant to alcohol withdrawal risk . For example, if a test with a narrow window of detection 15 is negative, the sensitivity of the test to detec t risk for alcohol withdrawal will be compromised. However, 16 the inclusion of certain measures of hepatic function have been found to be beneficial in risk 17 determination.4 For example, t he predictive ability of the AUDIT to recognize patients likely to develop 18 alcohol withdrawal is increased when combined with biological markers for unhealthy alcohol use 19 including ALT, GGT, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and aspartate aminotransf erase (AST).35 20 A biological test for alcohol use ( blood, breath, or urine ) can identify if a patient recently used alcohol, 21 and may be particularly helpful for those who are unable to com municate or otherwise give an alcohol use 22 history. Sometimes, patients may not be sure of the answer, or might be embarrassed to say that they 23 drank very recently. When conducting a biological test, consider the range of time (window of detection) 24 in which the test can detect alcohol use. For example, a breathalyzer can detect alcohol use at an 25 approximate rate of 1 standard drink per hour . In addition, h igh tolerance to heavy consumption can lead 26 to increased rates of alchol metabolism and clearance rates outside of expected ranges. This means 27 patients can have a negative breathalyzer test result and be at risk for alcohol withdrawal. 28 Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) combined with clinical signs can indicate risk for withdrawal. 29 Patients with elevated BAC who are not clinically intoxicated should be considered at risk for alcohol 30 withdrawal, as this suggests tolerance to regular heavy use of alcohol.2,7,36 Clinical guidance has differed 31 regarding the specific BAC that might indicate heightened risk, but estimates include 100 mg/DL,2 150 32 mg/DL,36 and 200 mg/DL.7 33 A diagnostic assessment for alcohol withdrawal or assessment of risk for developing alcohol withdrawal 34 following cessation of (or reduction in) alcohol consumption is indicated if the clinician is aware that the 35 patient's alcohol use patterns constitute a risk of alcohol withdrawal or if they are displaying signs or 36 symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. 37 38 43 IDENTIFICATION AND DIAGNOSIS Box 1: Neuroscience of Alcohol Withdrawal The ingestion of ethanol does several things to the human body. But the most important in relation to the development of alcohol withdrawal is the effect of its binding to the -aminobutyric acid receptor A(GABAA). At low levels of ethanol, we see the predicable GABAA effects of decreased anxiety, decreased inhibition and an altering of the motor centers. However, if ethanol is used for an extended time, and at higher levels, we begin to see alterations in the signaling of the extended amygdala. In particular, prolonged alcohol use causes an upregulation of N -methyl -D-Aspartate receptors (NMDAr) and a downregulation of GABAA. The ultimate resu lt is that if the ethanol is abruptly stopped, there is an imbalance of excitatory vs inhibitory signals. With a high glutaminergic (excitatory) state and a low GABA ergic (inhibitory) state, we see the typical signs of alcohol withdrawal ; tremor, seizures, nausea and delirium. The major excitatory signal caused by excess glutamate and norepinephrine and the lower GABAA signaling resulting from both a decrease in gamma -aminobutyric acid and a change in the GABAA receptor binding characteristics. While the a bove explains (in very condensed form) the reasons for the clinical features of alcohol withdrawal, we can also glean why certain interventions may be helpful in abating the symptoms. For example, the use of benzodiazepines and certain anti -seizure medicat (carbamazepine and valproic acid ) can be used to abate the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal by reversing the GABAA deficiency. When these are not sufficient, we can use adjuvants (alpha2 - adrenergic agonists [A2AAs] ) that can the over activity of the excitatory molecule glutamate or one with both mechanisms of action (phenobarbital). Given the complexity of an individual's genetics, epigenetics, and patterns of use, we are left with a variable response to any single medica tion. This is why we have discussed many evidence -based options for the treatment of such a complex syndrome. 1 B. Diagnosis 2 Recommendation I.5: To diagnose alcohol withdrawal and alcohol withdrawal delirium , use diagnostic 3 criteria such as those provided by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5 ( DSM -5). To diagnose alcohol 4 use disorder, use diagnostic criteria such as those provided by the DSM -5. 5 Recommendation I.6: Alcohol withdrawal severity assessment scales (including the Clinical Instrument 6 Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol , Revised [CIWA -Ar]) should not be used as a diagnostic tool 7 because scores can be influenced by conditions other than alcohol withdrawal. 8 Recommendation I. 7: Do not rule in or rule out the presence of alcohol withdrawal for patients who 9 have a positive blood alcohol concentration. 10 Discussion 11 Whenever a clinician is making a diagnosis such as those relevant to this guideline ( Alcohol W ithdrawal 12 Syndrome, Alcoho l Withdrawal Delirium, and Alcohol Use D isorder ), they should use standard 13 diagnostic criteria such as The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual -5 (DSM -5). While withdrawal severity 14 assessment scale s such as the Clinical Instrument Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol , Revised (CIWA - 15 Ar) score many of the signs and symptoms listed in the DSM -5 Criteria, these scale s are non -specific 16 regarding the etiology of signs and symptoms and high scores may be the result of the presence of other 17 conditions (e .g., dehydration, fever from infection, Graves' Disease).2,13,36 Alcohol withdrawal severity 18 44 IDENTIFICATION AND DIAGNOSIS assessment scale s are designed to assess the signs and symptoms of withdrawal only once a diagnosis has 1 been established.37 2 As a primary criterion for the diagnosis of alcohol withdrawal, asking patients about the timing of a recent 3 cessation of (or reduction in) alcohol use is essential. Sometimes, patients may not be sure of the answer, 4 or might be embarrassed to say that they drank very recently. A biological test for alcohol use can be 5 helpful in this case. Although alcohol withdrawal is associated with the sudden absence of alcohol in the 6 system, it should be noted that minor signs and symptoms can be seen after a significant reduction in 7 alcohol intake if the reduction changes the equilibrium of excitatory vs inhibitory neurochemical 8 signal ing (see Box 1) reached during a period of heavy, consistent and prolonged alcohol use.38 This 9 means patients can have a positive blood a lcohol concentration and experience alcohol withdrawal signs 10 and symptoms. 11 12 Box 2: DSM -5 Criteria for Alcohol W ithdrawal A. Cessation of (or reduction in) alcohol use that has been heavy and prolonged. B. Two (or more) of the following, developing within several hours to a few days after the cessation of (or reduction in) alcohol use described in Criterion A: 1. Autonomic hyperactivity (e.g., sweating or p ulse rate greater than 100 bpm) 2. Increased hand tremor 3. Insomnia 4. Nausea or vomiting 5. Transient visual, tactile, or audit ory hallucinations or illusions 6. Psychomotor agitation 7. Anxiety 8. Generalized tonic -clonic seizures C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant distress or impairment in socia l, occupation, or other important areas of functioning. D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance. 13 Accordin g to DSM -5, alcohol withdrawal delirium should be diagnosed when the primary symptoms of 14 delirium predominate over other withdrawal symptoms. 15 16 45 IDENTIFICATION AND DIAGNOSIS Box 3: DSM -5 Criteria for Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium (generic criteria for delirium in the presence of heavy and prolonged alcohol use): A. A disturbance in attention (i.e., reduced ability to focus, sustain, and shift attention) and awareness (reduced orientation to the environment). B. Disturbance devel ops over a short period of time (usually hours to a few days), represents a change from baseline attention and awareness, and tends to fluctuate in severity during the course of a day. C. An additional disturbance in cognition (e.g., memory deficit, disorient ation, language, visuospatial ability, or perception). D. The disturbances in Criteria A and C are not better explained by another preexisting, established, or evolving neurocognitive disorder and do not occur in the context of a severely reduced level of aro usal, such as coma. E. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is a direct physiological consequence of another medical condition, substance intoxication or withdrawal (i.e., due to drug of abuse o r to a medication), or exposure to a toxin, or is due to multiple etiologies. Specify: Substance withdrawal delirium a. This diagnosis should be made instead of substance withdrawal when the symptoms in Criteria A and C predominate in the clinical picture an d when they are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention. 1 Given that alcohol withdrawal is itself a diagnostic criterion for alcohol use disorder, patients presenting 2 with alcohol withdrawal symptoms almost certainly also have an alcohol use disorder. It is still 3 recommended that diagnostic criteria such as the D SM-5 should be used to establish such a diagnosis. 4 5 46 IDENTIFICATION AND DIAGNOSIS Box 4: DSM -5 Criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder: A. A problematic pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the following, occurring within a 12 -month period: 1. Alcohol is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended. 2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control alcohol use. 3. A great deal of time is spent in act ivities necessary to obtain alcohol, use alcohol, or recover from its effects 4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use alcohol 5. Recurrent alcohol use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home 6. Continued alcohol use d espite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of alcohol 7. Important social, occupations, or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of alcohol use 8. Recurrent alcohol use in situati ons in which it is physically hazardous. 9. Alcohol use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by alcohol 10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the f ollowing: i. A need for markedly increased amounts of alcohol to achieve intoxication or desired effect ii. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of alcohol 11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: i. The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for alcohol ii. Alcohol (or closely related substance, such as a benzodiazepine) is ta ken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms. 1 C. Differential Diagnosis 2 Recommendation I.8: As part of differential diagnosis, assess the patient's signs, symptoms, and history. 3 Rule out other serious illnesses that can mimic the signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Determine 4 if patients take medications that can mask the signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. 5 Recommendation I.9: Do not rule in or rule out a co -occurring disease, co-occurring mental health 6 disorder, co-occurring substance use disorder, or simultaneous withdrawal from other substances even in 7 the presence of alcohol withdrawal. 8 Recommendation I. 10: Conduct a neurolog ical exam in patients presenting with a seizure to determine 9 etiology . A seizure should only be attributed to alcohol withdrawal if there was a recent cessation of (or 10 reduction in ) a patient's alcohol consumption. For patients experiencing new onset seizu res or for patients 11 with a known history of alcohol withdrawal seizures showing a new pattern, an electroencephalogram 12 and/or neuroimaging is recommended . For patients with a known history of withdrawal seizure who 13 present with a seizure that can be attributed to alcohol withdrawal, additional neurological testing and a 14 neurology consult may not be necessary . This includes if the seizure was generalized and without focal 15 elements, if a careful neurological exami nation reveals no evidence of focal deficits, and if there is no 16 suspicion of meningitis or other etiology . 17 47 IDENTIFICATION AND DIAGNOSIS Recommendation I.11: For patients presenting with delirium, c onduct a detailed neurolo gical and 1 medical examination with appropriate testing to rule out other common causes of delirium regardless of 2 the apparent etiology. Attempt to d istinguish between hallucinations associated with alcohol withdrawal 3 delirium and alcohol hallucinosis/ alcohol -induced psychotic disorder . 4 Discussion 5 As with any diagnosis, it is essential to rule out other possible explanations for the constellation of signs 6 and symptoms presented. Because the syndrome can quickly progress in severity, clinicians suspecting 7 alcohol withdrawal should gather information about recent alcohol use history, especially recent cessation 8 of (or reduction in ) alcohol use. For example, t he DSM -5 notes that medi cal conditions including 9 hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis both can mimic alcohol withdrawal, and an essential tremor may 10 mimic tremors associated with alcohol withdrawal. Additionally, signs and symptoms of sedative, 11 hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawa l are similar to those of alcohol withdrawal, underscor ing the 12 importance of assessing for recent alcohol and other substance use. If recent alcohol use and 13 cessation /reduction suggests possible withdrawal, but the patients is not exhibiting any signs or s ymptoms 14 of withdrawal, clinicians should consider whether the patient is taking any medications that can mask 15 these symptoms, such as beta -adrenergic antagonists (beta -blockers) . 16 While making appropriate differential diagnosis is critical, it should be not ed that alcohol withdrawal is 17 often seen in conjunction with other health conditions, including mental health disorders, substance - 18 related disorders , or simultaneous withdrawal from other substances besides alcohol . The refore, clinicians 19 should not discoun t the possibility of co -occurring conditions once a diagnosis of alcohol withdrawal has 20 been made . 21 Patients presenting with seizure(s) should be provided a neurological exam and medical evaluation to 22 determine seizure etiology.2,36,41 The exam and evaluation should include a patient's history of marked 23 cessation of (or reduction in) alcohol use. An alcohol withdrawal -relate d seizure should only be 24 diagnosed if there has been a clear history of marked cessation of (or reduction in) alcohol use in the 24 to 25 48 hours prior to the seizure.2 26 Patients presenting with a new onset seizure should be provided a full neurologic examination including 27 brain imaging with possible lumbar puncture and electroencephalogram ( EEG ). A thorough neurological 28 examination and EEG should also be provided to patients with a new pattern of alcohol withdrawal 29 related seizures.2,42 However, if a patient has a known history of alcohol -withdrawal related seizures that 30 are clearly attributed to alcohol withdrawal, it may not be necessary to do additional neurologica l testing. 31 If a patient's alcohol use history and time course of the seizure are inconsistent with an alcohol 32 withdrawal seizure or if the neurological examination identifies focal neurological deficits, meningitis, 33 fever, status epilepticus, recent head t rauma, or other possible causes of seizure, further testing should be 34 completed to determine etiology. 35 Patients presenting with delirium should be provided a neurological exam and medical evaluation to 36 determine etiology. The history and examination shoul d provide a clear understanding of the relationship 37 between cessation or reduction of alcohol intake and the onset of withdrawal signs and symptoms to 38 eliminate other reasons for delirium .2 The onset of alcohol withdrawal delirium typically occurs 24 -48 39 hours after cessation of (or reduction in) alcohol use but can develop as many as 3 -5 days later. If a 40 patient's alcohol use history and the time course of deliriu m are inconsistent with alcohol withdrawal 41 delirium or if there is not suspicion of substance -induced psychotic disorder, hypoglycemia, diabetic 42 48 IDENTIFICATION AND DIAGNOSIS ketoacidosis, or other possible causes of delirium further testing should be completed to determine 1 etiology .43 2 Patients may present with hallucinosis , which is hallucinations that occur in the absence of other clinically 3 prominent withdrawal signs and symptoms such as clear delirium . Hallucinosis consist of primarily 4 auditory hallucinations but may include visual hallucinations and delusions.44 It is unclear if alcohol 5 hallucinosis is part of alcohol withdrawal syndrome or if the hallucinations are a complication of chronic 6 alcohol use u nrelated to withdrawal . Alcohol hallucinosis is currently diagnosed as Alcohol -induced 7 Psychotic Disorder in the DSM -5. Clinicians should attempt to distinguish between hallucinosis and 8 alcohol withdrawal delirium when making a diagnosis, although this may not always be possible during 9 the early stages of withdrawal .2 If hallucinations persist beyond 72 hours of onset, the more likely 10 diagnosis is alcohol -related psychotic disorder. While alcohol -induced disorders are not a focus of this 11 Guideline, some general guidance is offered in the section VI.C : Alcohol -Induced Psychotic Disorder . 12 49 INITIAL ASSESSMENT II. Initial Assessment of Alcohol Withdrawal 1 A. General Approach 2 Recommendation II.1: First, determine whether a patient is at risk of developing severe and/or 3 complicated alcohol withdrawal or complications from alcohol withdrawal . In addition to current signs 4 and symptoms, a validated risk assessment scale and an assessment of individual risk factors should be 5 utilized. 6 Recommendation II.2: A history and physical examination should be included as part of the 7 comprehensive assessment process. Clinicians should conduct this examination themselves or ensure that 8 a current physical examination is contained within the patient's medical record. 9 Reco mmendation II.3: Additional information about risk factors can be gleaned by interviewing family, 10 friends, and caregivers about a patient's history of alcohol withdrawal, seizures, and delirium, as 11 appropriate. Whenever possible in non -emergent situations, obtain written or verbal consent from the 12 patient before speaking with or consulting with collateral sources . 13 Recommendation II.4: Clinicians should seek information about the time elapsed since the patient's 14 cessation of (or reduction in ) alcohol use. T he timeline of symptom onset and severity helps determine the 15 risk window for developing severe or complicated withdrawal. 16 Discussion 17 It is common for recommendations about the initial assessment for managing alcohol withdrawal to focus 18 on evaluating current signs and symptoms rather than the risk of developing serious forms of the 19 syndrome . However, signs and symptoms can escalate quickly and the trajectory of alcohol withdrawal 20 can vary considerably among pa tients. As the most severe presentations of alcohol withdrawal are life 21 threatening, orienting the initial assessment toward evaluating risk as opposed to current presentation is 22 recommended. In considering patient risk, clinicians should assess their risk of severe withdrawal, 23 complicated withdrawal (used in this guideline to describe withdrawal -related seizures or alcohol 24 withdrawal delirium) , or complications of withdrawal, which refers to a potentially life -threatening 25 exacerbation of existing medical o r psychiatric conditions. 26 A detailed history and physical exam should be conducted as part of the initial assessment of alcohol 27 withdrawal and can be an extension of the process of differential diagnosis. The history and physical 28 exam should identify current withdrawal severity, ri sk factors for developing life -threatening symptoms 29 and potentially complicating conditions. In the event a patient cannot provide a clear history, interviewing 30 family, friends, and caregivers about risk factors is appropriate. Providers should follow thei r setting/state 31 rules on obtaining written or verbal consent or release of information prior to consulting with collateral 32 sources . Individual risk factors are described in the following section. Also discussed in the following 33 section are the use of quest ionnaires developed to assess risk of severe or complicated withdrawal and to 34 assess current signs and symptoms of withdrawal. 35 When evaluating risk, clinicians should consider the time elapsed since the patient's cessation of (or 36 reduction in) alcohol use.45 Signs and sympt oms of alcohol withdrawal typically begin 6-24 hours after 37 cessation of (or reduction in) alcohol use.2 Early identification and medication management can reduce 38 the risk of progression to severe or complicated alcohol w ithdrawal syndromes.46 Early withdrawal signs 39 50 INITIAL ASSESSMENT and symptoms may include anxiety, sleep disturbances, anorexia, vivid dreams, headache, nausea, 1 tachycardia, hyperactive reflexes, sweating, elevated blood pressure and hyperthermia.2 Seizures may 2 begin as early as 8 hours after cessation of (or reduction in) alcohol use and can continue for up to 48 3 hours with a peak activity occurring around 24 hours.2 Hallucinations develop within 12 -24 hours 4 follo wing cessation of (or reduction in) alcohol use and typically resolve within 24 -48 hours if other signs 5 indicative of withdrawal delirium do not emerge. The onset of alcohol withdrawal delirium appears 6 between 72 and 96 hours after a patient's last drink a nd can last as short as a few hours, but usually for 2- 7 3 days.2 8 Not all patients progress through these stages sequentially. For example, a seizure may occur in the 9 absence of other clinically prominent alcohol withdraw al signs or symptoms. In particular, elderly 10 patients may have a different timeline of development.2 Concomitant use of alcohol and other sedative 11 hypnotics can also change the presentation of withdrawal signs and sympto ms.38 12 B. Risk Factors for Severe or Complicated Withdrawal 13 Recommendation I I.5: Assess for the following factors associated with increased patient risk for 14 complicated withdrawal or complications of withdrawal: 15 History of alcohol withdrawal delirium or alcohol withdrawal seizure 16 Numerous prior withdrawal episodes in the patient's lifetime 17 Comorbid medical or surgica l illness (especially traumatic brain injury) 18 Increased age (>65) 19 Long duration of heavy and regular alcohol consumption 20 Seizure (s) during the current withdrawal episode 21 Marked autonomic hyperactivity on presentation 22 Physiological dependence on GABAergic agents such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates 23 Recommendation I I.6: The following individual factors may increase a patient's risk for complicated 24 withdrawal or complications of withdrawal: 25 Concomitant use of other addictive substances 26 Positive blood alcohol concentration in the presence of signs and symptoms of withdrawal 27 Signs or s ymptoms of a co -occurring psychiatric disorder are active and reflect a moderate level 28 of severity 29 Recommendation I I.7: Patients' risk for complicated withdrawal or complications of withdrawal is 30 increase d by the presence of multiple risk factors. 31 Recommendation I I.8: In general, clinicians may consider patients at risk of severe or complicated 32 withdrawal if they are experiencing a t least moderate alcohol withdrawal on presentation (e.g., CIWA -Ar 33 score 10). 34 Discussion 35 Several individual risk factors were deemed meaningful by the Guideline Committee based on an analysis 36 of the existing empirical literature combined with their clinical experience . There is strong empirical and 37 clinical support for a history of alcohol -related se izures or delirium as predictive of future incidences of 38 severe withdrawal.28,47 A systematic review and meta -analysis of 15 studies of predictors of severe 39 51 INITIAL ASSESSMENT alcohol withdrawal concluded that prior alcohol withdrawal delirium, prior withdrawal -related seizure, 1 prior severe alcohol withdrawal, lower platelet count, and higher alanine aminotransferase (ALT ) were 2 associated with a significantly higher incidence of alcohol withdrawal -related seizu re or alcohol 3 withdrawal delirium .48 4 Consistent with the results of the 2014 systematic review, the idea that prior incidences of alcohol 5 withdrawal delirium and seizure should be considered important risk factors for severe alcohol 6 withdrawal has been echoed in numerous clinical guidelines and review articles .12,36,49 -51 Repeated 7 episodes of alcohol withdrawal syndrome also become progressively more severe as the result of 8 increased neuronal excitability and sensitivity, a phenomenon known as the kindling effect .4 9 There is a lack of consensus about additional individual risk factors that contribute to severe alcohol 10 withdrawal. Although the previously mentioned systematic review failed to find an association between 11 other individual risk factors and risk of severe a lcohol withdrawal, the review's primary finding was that 12 \"prediction of severe alcohol withdrawal is highly variable, and that few demographic, clinical, or 13 biochemical parameters are consistently predictive \".48 (p2674) 14 The presence of a severe medical illness has been reported to precipitate severe alcohol withdrawal and to 15 increase the risk of withdraw al seizures and delirium.4,7 SAMHSA's Treatment Improvement Protocol 16 (TIP) 45 on withdrawal management,4 as well as a number of other published guidelines,2,7,36 recommend 17 that comorbid medica l or surgical illness be considered a significant risk factor for complicated 18 withdrawal or complications of alcohol withdrawal. 19 Older age may heighten a patient's risk of severe alcohol withdrawal, although advanced age may simply 20 be correlated with the p resence of complex comorbid health conditions.4,7 21 The value of assessing a patient's alcohol use pattern or amount has been contested in the literature. Some 22 note the duration of heavy drinking has not been useful in triaging patients,2 others have argued the 23 opposite.36,44,49 As with advanced age, a longer duration of alcohol use may simply be correlated with 24 more significant comorbid health issues, which can lead to complications of alcohol withdrawal. 25 Patients who have experienced a seizure as part of the current withdrawal episode, but prior to the clinical 26 assessment, should be considered at high risk of complicated withdrawal. Following an alcohol 27 withdrawal seizure, a patient is at increased risk for another seizure and progression to alcohol withdrawal 28 delirium .2,4,51,52 29 Although heart rate an d rhythm are often signs measured to assess alcohol withdrawal, there is 30 disagreement about the predictive value of heart rate for identifying risk of withdrawal. Some of the 31 literature suggests clinicians consider marked autonomic hyperactivity (measured by heart rate) to be an 32 indication of severe withdrawal,2 while others argue that an elevated heart rate does not identify the risk 33 of severe withdrawal.42 34 Concomitant physiological dependence on central nervous system depressants such as benzodia zepines 35 and barbiturates has also been suggested as a risk factor for complicated alcohol withdrawal.7,36,51 36 Medication management may also be compl icated as individuals taking sedative -hypnotic medications 37 exhibit tolerance to benzodiazepines and should be monitored closely for appropriate dose if prescribed 38 benzodiazepines for withdrawal (see IV.A : Monitoring ).53 39 Additional individual risk factors were deemed potentially meaningful by the Guideline Committee based 40 on an analysis of the existing empirical literature combined with their clinical experience . In terms of the 41 value of concomitant substance use as a predicator of complicated withdrawal or complications of alcohol 42 52 INITIAL ASSESSMENT withdrawal, the Guideline Committee emphasized that the risk varies significantly based on the type of 1 substance used, as well as patterns of use. However, concomitant substance use may play a role in the 2 development of life -threatening presentations of the syndrome .7,51 3 An indication of risk for severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal is the presence of alcohol withdrawal 4 signs and symptoms while having a positive blood alcohol concentration (BAC).4 Although alcohol 5 withdrawal is associated with the sudden absence of alcohol in the system, minor signs and symptoms can 6 be seen after a significant reduction in alcohol intake if the reduction alters the equilibrium of excitatory 7 vs inhibitory neurochem ical signal ing (see Box 1) reached during a period of heavy, consistent and 8 prolonged alcohol use.38 When using a breathalyzer, clinicians may wish to repeat their measurement 9 serially to follow the level and course of intoxication.39,40 10 Withdrawal can complicate the treatment of an underl ying mental health disorder. A patient whose co - 11 occurring psychi atric disorder symptoms are active may need specialist treatment . 12 Moderate to severe withdrawal at baseline (e.g., CIWA -Ar 10) has been identified as a risk factor for 13 developing more severe withdrawal in inpatient settings .54 The Guideline Committee also agreed that risk 14 for complicated withdrawal or complications of withdrawal is increased when multiple risk factors are 15 present. 16 C. Risk Assessment Tools 17 Recommendation I I.9: Clinicians can consider the use of a tool such as The ASAM Criteria Risk 18 Assessment Matrix to assess a patient's risk of severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal as well as 19 potenti al complications of withdrawal . 20 Recommendation I I.10: The following scale s can be helpful for assessing for the risk of severe alcohol 21 withdrawal: 22 Prediction of Alcohol Withdrawal Severity Scale (PAWSS) 23 Luebeck Alcohol -Withdrawal Risk Scale (LARS) 24 Discussion 25 The Risk Assessment Matrix is described in The ASAM Criteria12 and offers a multidimensional risk 26 assessment for patients with or at risk for developing alcohol withdrawal. It classifies patient r isk on a 27 scale of 0 -4 across six dimensions and provides decision rules to recommend appropriate treatment 28 interventions for patients at each level. 29 Scales have been developed to identify patients at risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol 30 withdrawal, including the Luebeck Alcohol Withdrawal Risk Scale (LARS)55 and Prediction of Alcohol 31 Withdrawal Severity Scale (PAWSS).28 The LARS was specifically designed to predict severe alcohol 32 withdrawal among patients without significant comorbid medical illness. A prospective study of 1 00 33 patients in a hospital psychiatric ward showed that a LARS score 17 significantly differentiated patients 34 with severe withdrawal from patients with mild to moderate withdrawal with a sensitivity of 100% and a 35 specificity of 88%.55 The PAWSS is a severity scale designed specifically for predicting risk of 36 developing complicated alcohol withdrawal (defined as a CIWA -Ar score 15) in the medically ill, 37 validated by prospective stud ies comparing the PAWSS with retrospective chart review and with the 38 CIWA -Ar.28,47 The PAWSS includes an initial screener question (\"Have you consumed any amount of 39 53 INITIAL ASSESSMENT alcohol within the last 30 days\" or \"did the patient have a positive BAL upon admission \") and can be 1 used with patients who are no t currently exhibiting signs of withdrawal. The authors identified a threshold 2 score which identified patients who later scored 15 on the CIWA -Ar during their hospital stay with 3 93.1% sensitivity and 99.5% specificity .47 4 These scale s and their associated features and evidence base, are summarized in Appendix III. 5 D. Symptom Assessment Scale s 6 Recommendation II. 11: A validated instrument should be used to assess alcohol withdrawal severity . 7 Recommendation II.12: Assess the risk for scores on a withdrawal severity assessment scale to be 8 confounded with c auses other than alcohol withdrawal . If risk factors are present, interpret the results of 9 scales with caution. Use a scale that relies more on objective signs of withdrawal (autonomic activity) if a 10 patient has difficulty communicating about their symptom s. See Appendix III for the features of different 11 scales. 12 Recommendation II.13: A validated withdrawal severity assessment instrument can be used as part of 13 risk assessment. A high initial score can indicate risk of developing severe or complicated withdrawal, 14 although scores should not be the only information used to predict patient risk. 15 Discussion 16 A patient's cu rrent withdrawal symptom severity should be assessed using a structured withdrawal 17 assessment scale. Scores on a symptom assessment scale can be confounded with causes other than 18 alcohol withdrawal . For example, scores can be falsely elevated due to comorb id conditions (e.g. fever 19 from infection, concurrent withdrawal from another substance) and falsely suppressed due to the use of 20 certain medications (e.g., beta -blockers and other sympatholytic drugs).2 If risk factors a re present, 21 interpret the results of symptom assessment scales with caution. Some scales require self -report from 22 patients about their symptoms and cannot be administered to patients with a communication difficulty, 23 those who are experiencing symptoms of d elirium, or those who are critically ill. In these instances, u se a 24 withdrawal symptom assessment scale that relies more on objective signs of withdrawal (autonomic 25 activity). These scales and their associated features and evidence base are summarized in Appendix IIII. 26 Currently, there is insufficient evidence to prefer one scale to another; the choice instead depends on 27 clinician preference. The most commonly discussed and utilized scale is the CIWA -Ar.12,38,56,57 The 28 CIWA -Ar was designed to measure the severity of alcohol withdrawal for research studies .37 It is a 10 - 29 item standardized scale with demons trated validity and interrater reliability. The CIWA -Ar itself does not 30 offer score ranges categorizing symptom severity. The developers of the CIWA -Ar suggested different 31 interventions for scores of <10, 10 -20, and > 20, but these were based on the clinic al experience of the 32 authors and not empirical data .37 Numerous guidelines and review articles offer guidance about the 33 appropriate intervention for different ranges of CIWA -Ar scores .4,41,58 34 Throughout this document, we provide examples for withdrawal severity using the CIWA -Ar, although 35 other scale s can be used. Regardless of the in strument used, there is a wide variety in the literature and in 36 practice as to which scores best delineate mild, moderate and severe withdrawal. Classification of 37 withdrawal severity is ultimately up to the judgment of clinicians and clinical programs migh t choose 38 reference ranges based on their particular patient population or capabilities. 39 54 INITIAL ASSESSMENT See Table 1 Table 1. Alcohol Withdrawal Severity for the categori zation of withdrawal severity used in 1 this guideline. 2 Despite its widespread use, clinicians should be aware of the limitations of the CIWA -Ar. It requires 3 clinician training for reliable administration and is criticized for the time it takes to administe r.57,59 It also 4 requires patients to self -report about symptoms including nausea/vomiting, anxiety, tactile and auditory 5 disturbances, and headache and can be difficult, if not impossible, to administer to patients experiencing 6 severe or complicated withdrawal or those who are critically ill. 7 While the CIWA -Ar is the most well -known and widely adopted alcohol withdrawal severity scale, 8 modifications a nd alternative scales have been developed and evidence of their validity and reliability is 9 emerging . The Newcastle A lcohol Withdrawal Scale is a modified version of the CIWA -Ar which relies 10 more on objective signs of withdrawal .60 The BAWS was developed as a shorter and more objective 11 method to assess alcohol withdrawal signs and symp toms and early evidence has demonstrated favorable 12 sensitivity and specificity compared with the CIWA -Ar.59 The SAWS, a 5 -item instrument designed to be 13 self-administered by patients, has be en validated in ambulatory settings .61 14 The CIWA -Ar and similar scale s are not designed to assess the risk for developing severe withdrawal, but 15 they are commonly called upon for this task. The Guideline Committee noted that withdrawal assessment 16 scales can provide some indication of risk in that a patient's current signs and symptoms can provide 17 valuable (although partial) information about their risk of severe or complicated withdrawal. However, it 18 should be stressed that symptom assessment scales cannot indicate alcohol withdrawal risk if the patient 19 is not currently experiencing signs or symptoms of withdrawal.58 One observational stud y using the 20 Newcastle A lcohol Withdrawal Scale to guide treatment found that hospital patients scoring >15 at 21 baseline were at higher risk of severe withdrawal if they did not receive medication .60 22 Although these scales have generally not been found to be superior to the CIWA -Ar at identifying the 23 potential risk of developing severe or complicated withdrawal , they may be more feasible to administer 24 than the CIWA -Ar in some inpatient settings. The Guideline Committee considered each scale to be an 25 acceptable option for assessing hospitalized patients after diagnosis of alcohol withdrawal. 26 E. Identify Concurrent Conditions 27 Recommendation II.14: When assessing for concurrent medical conditions, screen patients for medical 28 conditions that could affect the course of alcohol withdrawal or treatment of alcohol withdrawal, as well 29 as common chronic conditions that are associated with alcohol use disorders. 30 Recommendation II. 15: A pregnancy test should be obtained for wom en of childbearing poten tial. For 31 managing pregnant patients , see section VII.F Patients who are Pregnant . 32 Recommendation II.16: In settings with access to laboratory tests, clinicians should conduct and/or 33 arrange for a comprehensive metabolic profile (CMP) or basic metabolic profile (BMP), a hepatic panel, 34 and a complete blood count with differential to assess a patient's electrolytes, liver functioning, renal 35 functioning and immune functioning. In a setting with limited access to laboratory testing , clinicians 36 should obtain results when pract ical to assist with treatment planning decisions. Address any nutritional 37 deficiencies detected. 38 Initial screening may also include laboratory tests for: 39 Hepatitis 40 55 INITIAL ASSESSMENT Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV) (with consent ) 1 Tubercul osis 2 Recommendation II.17: Assess patients for polysubstance use and be prepared to treat other potential 3 withdrawal syndromes. To assess a patient's other substance use, it may be helpful to: 4 Use a validated scale that addresses other substance us e, such as the Alcohol, Smoking and 5 Substance Involvement Screening Test ( ASSIST ) 6 Conduct a urine or other toxicology test to detect other substance use 7 Utilize information from collateral sources when possible (i.e., family and friends) 8 Recommendation II.18: Do not delay the initiation of treatment if alcohol withdrawal is suspected but 9 laboratory test results are not available at the treatment setting or the results are pending. 10 Recommendation II.19: Assess patients for concurrent mental health conditions, including a review of 11 their mental health history, to determine their mental health treatment needs. Consult with any mental 12 health professionals caring for such patients. Obtain written or verbal consent before consultation 13 whenever po ssible in non -emergent situations. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ -9) and the 14 Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD -7) scales can be helpful to screen for mental health disorders. Be 15 cautious when diagnosing a new primary mental health disorder during ac ute withdrawal, as it can be 16 difficult to differentiate between substance -induced signs and symptoms and primary psychiatric 17 disorders. 18 Recommendation II.20: Evaluate active suicide risk as part of the initial patient assessment. 19 Discussion 20 Clinicians s hould thoroughly assess patient s for concurrent physical and mental health conditions that 21 may a) complicate the course of alcohol withd rawal and/or b) necessitate their own treatment 22 interventions. There is not a standard medical evaluation process for pa tients with, or at risk for, alcohol 23 withdrawal, but it should include a history and physical examination and an assessment for concurrent 24 mental health conditions. The ASAM Guideline Committee recommends that clinicians be 25 knowledgeable about common chronic conditions associated with alcohol use disorders in order to screen 26 for likely concurrent medical conditions. Common chronic conditions associated with alcohol us e 27 disorders include high blood pressure, heart disease, liver disease and digestive problems. 28 Conditions that may be exacerbated by the increased autonomic hyperactivity associated with withdrawal, 29 such as cardiac illness, should be identified early for a ggressive autonomic symptom prevention. It should 30 also be identified whether patients take medications that may suppress autonomic symptoms and therefore 31 mask withdrawal severity, such as beta -adrenergic antagonists. Conditions associated with impaired liv er 32 functioning should also be identified as they may influence medication choice and/or dosing amounts. 33 Medical conditions that prevent the use of oral medication should also be identified, as parenteral 34 administration of medication is not available in all treatment settings. 35 Because pregnancy influences alcohol withdrawal management decisions and pregnancy tests are 36 typically available at most settings with rapid results, the Guideline Committee recommended that 37 clinicians conduct a pregnancy test for pat ients of childbearing potential with suspected alcohol 38 withdrawal. However, it should be noted that if a patient is presenting with signs and symptoms of 39 alcohol withdrawal and pregnancy status is unknown and a test is not immediately available, alcohol 40 withdrawal management should not be delayed. 41 56 INITIAL ASSESSMENT To aid in the identification of concurrent medical conditions, laboratory testing may be helpful. The 1 decision to conduct routine laboratory testing and what to test for should be informed by the patient's 2 signs a nd symptoms, known concurrent medical conditions, and availability. At a minimum, the 3 Guideline Committee recommended clinicians conduct and/or arrange for a comprehensive metabolic 4 profile (CMP) or basic metabolic profile (BMP), a hepatic panel, and a com plete blood count with 5 differential to assess a patient's electrolytes, liver functioning, renal functioning , and immune functioning. 6 In addition, laboratory tests for hepatitis, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) , and tuberculosis m ay 7 be considered if ind icated. In addition to identifying medical conditions with a high rate of co -occurrence 8 with alcohol withdrawal, the results of some tests, primarily for liver functioning, might guide the choice 9 of medication for alcohol withdrawal as discussed in later s ections on pharmacotherapy . 10 Hospitalized patients are a unique population because clinicians have greater access to laboratory tests 11 and rapid results. In an ambulatory setting, clinicians may have less access to lab oratory tests and be less 12 able to obtain rapid results.62 Therefore, in ambulatory settings, the Guideline Committee recommends 13 that in general, la boratory testing should be done when practical. However, clinicians should not delay 14 treatment if testing is unavailable or if test results are pending. 15 As discussed previously, concomitant substance use may play a role in the development of life - 16 threatening presentations of alcohol withdrawal syndrome.7,51 Of particular concern is concurrent 17 physiological dependence or withdrawal from other sedative hypnotics as it can affect symptom 18 presentation and response to commonly used withdrawal medications . Clinicians can use a screening 19 questionnaire to begin the identification process. Numerous validated scale s are available for assessing a 20 patient's substance use patterns. A recommended option is The Alcohol, Smoking and Substance 21 Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), developed by the World Health Organization.63,64 While the 22 ASSIST takes longer to complete than many available scale s, it is more comprehensive in the 23 identif ication of polysubstance use while many others scale s focus on a substance use broadly . 24 Also discussed previously are the complications that can be caused by alcohol withdrawal for managing a 25 patient's underlying mental health problem and vice versa . A mental health condition is not thought to 26 increase risk for severe , complicated , or complications of withdrawal. However, g iven the shared 27 symptomology of even mild forms of withdrawal , such as anxiety , agitation and sleep problems , with 28 common mental health disorders, determining the etiology of symptoms and judging appropriate response 29 to medication for alcohol withdrawal may be complicated.4 A review of the p atient's medical record can 30 reveal primary diagnoses and if the patient is currently under the care of a mental health professional, that 31 individual should be consulted. Providers should follow their setting/state rules on obtaining written or 32 verbal conse nt or release of information prior to consultation. 33 Clinicians can also consider the use of a standardized screening instrument for depression and anxiety , but 34 they should not diagnose a new primary mental health disorder during the acute withdrawal period .46 47 35 Both the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ -9) and the Generalize d Anxiety Disorder (GAD -7) 36 questionnaires ask a patient to assess their symptoms over the prior two weeks and recall can be affected 37 by current symptom state. Clinicians should also evaluate active suicide risk as part of the initial patient 38 assessment. 39 57 LEVEL OF CARE DETERMINATION III. Level of Care Determination 1 A. General Approach 2 Recommendation III.1: Level of care determination should be based on a patient's current signs and 3 symptoms; level of risk for developing severe or complicated withdrawal or complications of withdrawal ; 4 and other dimensions such as recovery capital and environment. Alcohol withdrawal can typically be 5 safely managed in an ambulatory setting for those patients with lim ited or mitigated risk factors . Patients 6 with low levels of psychosocial support or an unsafe environment may benefit from a more intensive level 7 of care than is otherwise indicated. 8 Recommendation III.2: Patients with active risk of suicide should be treated in a setting equipped to 9 manage patients at risk of suicide, which often necessitates admission to an inpatient psychiatric setting 10 that also provides withdrawal management services. 11 Discussion 12 The AS AM Criteria provide s comprehensive guidance on determining the appropriate level of care for 13 patient s in need of withdrawal management . Level of care determinations are based on an evaluation of 14 the expected risks and be nefits of treatment within each setting. A central tenet of The ASAM Criteria is 15 that patients should be matched with the least intensive level of care in which they can be safely and 16 effectively treated. In the absence of indications for inpatient treatme nt, which will be described in 17 following sections, most patients with alcohol withdrawal can be safely and effectively managed in 18 ambulatory settings .65-67 One 1995 estimate found that approximately 10% of patients with alcohol 19 withdrawal syndrome require inpatient treatment .68 In general, patients benefit from being treated in less 20 restrictive settings that minimize disruptions to family life, housing and employment, and reduce costs. 21 One RCT found that patients with mild -to-moderate alcohol withdrawal assigned to outpat ient treatment 22 had faster resolution of withdrawal compared to inpatient treatmen t.66 Ambulatory withdrawal 23 management should be preferred in the absence of any indications for inpatient treatment .51 24 Inpatient management is indicated for some patients. Lack of 24 -hour monitoring and distance to life 25 saving medical interv ention means that some patients with or at risk for developing severe or complicated 26 withdrawal or complications of alcohol withdrawal could experience great harm if treated in an 27 ambulatory setting. Ambulatory treatment is most appropriate for patients wh o have a low risk of 28 developing severe or complicated withdrawal ,69,70 which may include patients with mild or moderate 29 withdrawal syndrome .71 Some low -risk patients may benefit from treatment in an inpatient setting. For 30 example, patien ts with an absen ce of or unreliable support network may benefit from a more intensive 31 level of care .21,49 32 B. Level of Care Determination Tools 33 Recommendation III.3: The ASAM Criteria Risk Assessment Matrix and withdrawal severity scales can 34 be helpful for determining the appropriate level of care for managing patients in alcohol withdrawal. Most 35 withdrawal severity scales reflect current signs and symptoms and should not be used alone to determine 36 level of care. 37 58 LEVEL OF CARE DETERMINATION Discussion 1 The ASAM Criteria provide a guide for clinicians treating patients experiencing alcohol withdrawal or 2 seeking alcohol withdrawal management services. It accounts for cur rent signs and symptoms and 3 identifies potential risks for complicated withdrawal. This framework allows clinicians the ability to make 4 level of care determinations based on the most appropriate needs for each patient. The ASAM Criteria 5 encourages the use of symptom assessment scales such as the CIWA -Ar score in the decision making 6 process; however, it also emphasizes that symptom severity should not be used alone to make level of 7 care determinations. 8 The ASAM Criteria measure s a patient's risk of developing severe or complicated withdrawal or 9 complications of alcohol withdrawal by utilizing a multidimensional assessment that determines a 10 patient's risk s and strengths based on six dimensions . These dimensions include: (1) acute intoxication 11 and/or withdrawal potential, (2) biomedical conditions and complications, (3) emotional, behavioral, or 12 cognitive conditions and complications, (4) readiness to change, (5) rela pse, continued use, or continued 13 problem potential, and (6) recovery/living environment. Using the multidimensional assessment, 14 clinicians provide a risk rating for each dimension and an overall rating that allow them to identify the 15 patient's treatment ne eds and level of care most appropriate to meet those needs. 16 The ASAM Criteria provides a comprehensive set of criteria for appropriate placement in one of five 17 levels of care : 18 Level 1 -WM: Ambulatory withdrawal management without extended on -site monitoring 19 Level 2 -WM: Ambulatory withdrawal management with extended on -site monitoring 20 Level 3.2 -WM: Clinically managed residential withdrawal management 21 Level 3.7 -WM: Medically monitored inpatient withdrawal management 22 Level 4 -WM: Medically managed inte nsive inpatient withdrawal management 23 24 See The ASAM Criteria for a detailed description of services available in each level of care. 25 C. Considerations for Ambulatory vs Inpatient Management 26 While there are five distinct levels of care for withdrawal management defined by The ASAM Criteria , 27 much of the research on patient placement evaluates factors indicating (or contraindicating) placement in 28 an ambulatory or inpatient treatment setting. These settings align with the follo wing ASAM levels of 29 care: 30 Ambulatory 31 Level 1 -WM: Ambulatory withdrawal management without extended on -site monitoring 32 Level 2 -WM: Ambulatory withdrawal management with extended on -site monitoring. 33 Inpatient 34 Level 3.2 -WM: Clinically managed residential with drawal management 35 Level 3.7 -WM: Medically monitored inpatient withdrawal management 36 Level 4 -WM: Medically managed intensive inpatient withdrawal management 37 So as not to duplicate The ASAM Criteria , and in the interest of identifying consensus and strength of 38 evidence where it exists, this Guideline will largely focus on determining appropriate placement criteria 39 in these two categories of withdrawal setting: ambulatory and inpatient. However, due to increasing 40 interest in office -based alcohol withdrawal management by specialty and non -specialty clinicians, the 41 59 LEVEL OF CARE DETERMINATION significant difference in monitoring levels afforded by the two ambulatory settings, and at the reque st of 1 the Guideline Committee, the Guideline will distinguish between considerations for Level 1 -WM and 2 Level 2 -WM settings in this section. 3 Level 1 -WM is ambulatory withdrawal management without extended on -site monitoring. It can be 4 carried out in a ph ysician's office, by a home health care agency, or addiction treatment facility. Level 2 - 5 WM is ambulatory withdrawal management with extended on -site monitoring. It can be carried out in 6 structured outpatient settings such as a day hospital setting, a gene ral health care or mental health facility, 7 or an addiction treatment facility. Level 2 -WM is an organized service with the capacity to provide 8 regular medical assessments and monitor alcohol withdrawal syndrome progression. They may also have 9 access to psy chological or psychiatric treatment (see The ASAM Criteria for additional details). 10 Level of care determination is organized around risk -benefit principles , where an appropriate level of care 11 is one in which the expected benefits of treating a patient at a particular level of care are outweighed by 12 the risks . More intensive level s of care are appropriate for patients at increas ed risk of harm . This means 13 that if Level 1 -WM is not appropriate for a particular patient , Level 2 -WM may still be appropriate . 14 How ever, i f Level 2 -WM is not appropriate, then Level 1 -WM is also not appropriate . This patient should 15 be treated in an inpatient setting . The guideline does not currently make recommendations regarding 16 placement within the three levels of inpatient settings: Level 3.2 -WM, Level 3.7 -WM, and Level 4 -WM. 17 It should be noted that a patient's refusal or inability to attend a recommended level of c are should not 18 delay or preclude treatment at a level of care they are able to attend .12 19 20 60 LEVEL OF CARE DETERMINATION Recommendation III.4: 1 Table 2.

The Guideline Committee rated each placement consideration on a benefit -to-harm ratio, comparing the potential harm that might result from the factor bing considered to the expected benefit to the patient of being managed in a less restrictive setting. The rating was made in terms of the average patient in an aver age setting for both Level 1 -WM and Level 2 -WM. A consideration is Inappropriate for a given setting when the p otential harm outweighs the expected benefi t. A consideration is Appropriate for a given setting if the e xpected benefit outweigh s the potential harm . Neutral/Uncertain considerations are ones where the harms and benefits are about equal or cannot be determined or where the Guideline Committee disagreed. If a consideration that is inappropriate for Level -2-WM is present, the patient should be managed in an inpatient setting. CIWA -Ar, Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol , Revised ; BZD , Benzodiazepine ; OUD, Opioid Use Disorder ; WM, Withdrawal Manageemnt . 1 62 LEVEL OF CARE DETERMINATION Discussion 1 Withdrawal severity 2 Patients experiencing signs and symptoms of mild alcohol withdrawal such as mild or moderate anxiety, 3 sweating and insomnia, but no tremor (generally associated with a CIWA -Ar <10) can be managed in 4 Level 1 -WM or Level 2 -WM settings .2,39,62,72 While p roviding withdrawal management is within the 5 scope of practice for many clinicians including primary care physicians , an addiction specialist can be 6 consulted , if needed .72 7 Patients experiencing signs and symptoms of moderate alcohol withdrawal such as moderate anxiety, 8 sweating, insomnia, and mild tremor (generally associated with a CIWA -Ar 10 -18) can be managed in 9 Level 2 -WM setting s. Moderate withdrawal is not a reason to exclude p atients from Level 1 -WM setting s, 10 but the risk for such patients should be carefully considered . It should only be undertaken by experienced 11 clinician s. 12 Patients experiencing signs and symptoms of severe withdrawal such as severe anxiety and moderate to 13 severe tremor, but not confusion, hallucinations, or seizure (generally associated with a CIWA -Ar 19) 14 should not be managed in Level 1 -WM setting s.58 Sever e uncomplicated withdrawal is not a reason to 15 exclude patients from Level 2 -WM setting s. The risk for such patients should be carefully considered . 16 Some Level 2 -WM settings have intensive monitoring capabilit ies and experienced clinician s can safely 17 manage patients in severe withdrawal as long as they are not experiencing complicated symptoms . 18 Patients experiencing complicated withdrawal syndrome including seizure or signs indicative of delirium 19 - such as an inability to fully comprehend instr uctions, clouding of the sensorium or confusion - or new 20 onset of hallucinations , or has experienced a seizure during the current episode (generally associated with 21 a CIWA -Ar 19) should be managed in inpatient setting s.4,21,51,62,65 22 Concurrent withdrawa l and/o r physiological dependence 23 Concurrent withdrawal from or physiological dependence on another substance is a risk factor for 24 developing complicated alcohol withdrawal .21,58,62 The literature supports the management of these 25 patients in a level of care setting with increased monitoring and aggressive treatment management.62 26 Concurrent withdrawal from other substance(s) is not an exclusionary factor either level of ambulatory 27 care. The risk for such patients should be carefully considered . Managing alcohol withdraw al and 28 withdrawal from another sedative hypnotic58 is more complicated clinically than withdrawal from a 29 substance with different pharmacologic effects , such as stimulants. Consider that patient s should be 30 placed in the level of care appropri ate to the ir most acute problem , which may be withdrawal from the 31 other substance.12 Withdrawal from benzodiazepines produces more autonomic nervous system signs than 32 does withdrawal from alcohol.73 33 Patient s with a physiological dependence on benzodiazepines or a co-occurring benzodiazepine use 34 disorder should not be treated in a Level 1 -WM setting , but are not excluded from management in a Level 35 2-WM setting . The risk for such patients should be carefully considered. If deemed appropriate, patients 36 may be treated with cautious use of benzodiazepines (see IV.D(3) : Benzodiazepine use ) or an alternative 37 medication depending on the clinician's judgment and with careful monitoring 38 63 LEVEL OF CARE DETERMINATION Patients with a physiological dependence on opioids or a concurrent opioid use disorder can be m anaged 1 in a Level 2 -WM setting and are not excluded from management in a Level 1 -WM setting . The risk for 2 such patients should be carefully considered . Clinicians should have experience with co-managing opioid 3 use disorder and/or physiological dependence including initiating evidence -based medications for opioid 4 use disorder74 and with identifying emergent opioid withdrawal syndrome in addition to alcohol 5 withdrawal. 6 Recent high levels of consumption 7 Recent high levels of alcohol consumption has been cited as a consideration for level of care 8 determination.38,44 While most sources did not provide specific threshold amounts, the NICE guideline21 9 suggested that inpatient management be considered for patients who consume over 30 U.K. standard units 10 of alcohol per day, which is equivalent to 17 U.S. standard drinks per day. Inpatient treatment was 11 recommended for patients consuming over 7 U.S. standard drinks per day.36 The Guideline Committee 12 consider ed a cutoff of 8 U.S. standard drinks per day . Consumption of more than 8 U.S. standard drinks 13 per day is not an exclusionary factor for either ambulatory withdrawal ma nagent setting. 14 Alcohol withdrawal history 15 A history of severe and/or complicated alcohol withdrawal is a risk factor for alcohol withdrawal seizure 16 and delirium48 (see section II.B: Risk Factors for Severe or Complicated Withdrawal ) andis frequently 17 cited as an indicati on for treatment in an inpatient setting.21,51,58,65 The number and recency of prior 18 withdrawal episode s may also be a factor when determining appropriate level of care .49 An increasing 19 number of withdrawal episodes is associated with increasing severity through the kindling process. 20 With one exception, the Guideline Committee determined that a history of severe or complicated alcohol 21 withdra wal does not exclude patients from management in ambulatory settings. However, p atients with a 22 recent ( within the prior year) episode of complicated alcohol withdrawal should not be manage d in Level 23 1-WM setting s. Also, patients with a prior episode of severe alcohol withdrawal which occurr ed more 24 than one year ago can be managed in Level 2 -WM setting s. 25 Treatment history 26 While m ultiple prior failed attempts to complete alcohol withdrawal treatment has been cited as a 27 contraindication for ambulatory care ,56,58,65 previ ous unsuccessful attempts at ambulatory withdrawal 28 management does not exclude patients from management in ambulatory settings . The risk for such 29 patients should be carefully considered , Circumstances that led to unsuccessful treatment or a return to 30 probl em alcohol use in the past may have changed and should be assessed by the clinician in making a 31 determination of the appropriate level of care . 32 Other inpatient need s 33 Patients with medical or psychiatric conditions may receive alcohol withdrawal management at all levels 34 of care; however, if patient s have a co-morbid condition which requires inpatient treatment or 35 hospitalization, patient s should not be treated in an ambulatory setting.12,56 The ASAM Criteria states that 36 \"for management provided in conjunction with treatment for co -occurring conditions identified in the 37 comprehensive bio psychosocial screening assessment, The ASAM Criteria calls for the patient to be 38 placed in the level of care appropriate to the most acute problem .\"12(p131) Therefore, patients with a 39 64 LEVEL OF CARE DETERMINATION psychiatric or medical condition that requires services that are provided exclusively in an inpatient setting 1 should not be managed in ambulatory settings. 2 Biomedical conditions and complications 3 Como rbid illness 4 Comorbid illness is a risk factor for complicated/complications of alcohol withdrawal (see II.B: Risk 5 Factors for Severe or Complicated Withdrawal ), but the severity of illness and its likelihood of 6 complicating alcohol withdrawal management is a fa ctor for level of care determination.4,58 Patients with 7 a moderate to severe active and potentially destabilizing medical proble m should be managed in inpatient 8 settings. This includes unstable , severe chronic condition such as cardiovascular disease, liver disease , 9 COPD , or renal impairment should be managed in inpatient settings .21,65 Patients with a m oderate, active, 10 and potentially destabilizing medical problem should not be managed in a Level 1 -WM setting. Such 11 patients are not excluded from management in a Level 2 -WM setting. Some clinicians or programs may 12 have greater experience or access to resources allowing them to manage less severe comorbid illnesses in 13 an ambulatory setting. 14 Clinically significant laboratory values 15 Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values indicate the presence of a potentially destabilizing 16 medical problem. Abnormal lab results are not an exclusionary factor for managing patients in 17 ambulatory levels of care. S ome abnormal values can be corrected in ambulatory setting, while some may 18 signal the presence of medical condition s that should be managed in inpatient setting s. 62 19 Suspected head injury 20 Patients with a suspected head injury should not be managed in Level 1 -WM setting s. A suspected head 21 injury does not exclude management in Level 2 -WM setting s, but the risk for such patients should be 22 carefully considered. Some Level 2 -WM settings have the capability to intensive ly monitor patients for 23 complications which may develop. 24 History of epilepsy and generalized seizure 25 A history of epilepsy and genera lized seizure has been cited as an indi cation for inpatient treatment .21,51,75 26 Manag ing patient s with a history of epilepsy is appropriage in Level 2 -WM setting s and is not a reason 27 for excl usion from Level 1 -WM setting s. A history of non -alcohol withdrawal related seizures is not an 28 exclusionary factor for ambulatory setting s. Uncertainty about risk may be the result of limited scientific 29 research and evidence regarding the impact of non -alcohol withdrawal seizures and current withdrawal 30 management. Use clinical experience in the level of care determination. 31 Older age 32 Older age has been identified as a risk factor for complicated/complications of alcohol withdrawal (see 33 II.B: Risk Factors for Severe or Complicated Withdrawal ), possibly by heightening the severity of signs 34 or symptoms of withdrawal or due to correlation with other health problems. \"Older age\" has been left 35 undefined in other guidelines4,21 but was designated as age 65 and older by the Guideline Committee. It is 36 appropriate to manage older pa tients in a Level 2 -WM setting . Older age is not a reason to exclude older 37 patients from Level 1 -WM setting s, but the risk for such patients should be carefully considered . Some 38 older patients may be otherwise relatively health y. 39 65 LEVEL OF CARE DETERMINATION Tolerance of oral medicat ions 1 Patients who are unable to tolerate oral medication should not be treated in an ambulatory setting.58,62 2 Parenteral administ ration of medication is required in patients who are unable to take medication orally, 3 which is not always available in the average ambulatory setting. 4 Pregnancy 5 Pregnancy has been described as one of the \"medical conditions that could make ambulatory wit hdrawal 6 management problematic ,\"58(p57) and other guidelines have cited pregnancy as an indication for inpatient 7 treatment .62,65 See VII.F : Patients who are Pregnant for more information . 8 Emotional, behavioral , or cognitive conditions and complications 9 While the presence of a co -occurring psychiatric condition is frequently cited as a contraindication for 10 ambulatory care ,4,62 the type/severity and stability of psychiatric disorders is an important distinction in 11 determining appropriate level of care . Some patients mental health problems are well-controlled and some 12 ambulatory programs have onsite psychological or psychiatric staff. As withdrawal progress es in severity, 13 the average ambulatory clinic is less likely to have the resources needed to manage patients safely and 14 effectively and inpatient management with specialty psychiatric resources may be more appropriate. 15 Patients whose co-ocurring psychiatric disorder signs and symptoms are mild, reflecting a low level o f 16 severity or stability as the result of treatment , can be managed in Level 1 -WM or Level 2 -WM setting s. 17 Active psychiatric disorder signs and symptoms, reflecting a level of severity that may complicate 18 withdrawal management , are not a reason to exclude patients from ambulatory care, but the risk for such 19 patients should be carefully considered. Management may be appropriate if appropriate psychiatric 20 treatment resources are accessed. P atients whose psychia tric disorder signs and symptoms are moderate 21 should not be treated in Level 1 -WM settings, but are not excluded from management in Level 2 -WM 22 settings . Patients whose co -ocurring psychiatric disorder signs and symptoms are severe or unstable 23 should be managed in inpatient settings .21,44,58,65 24 Cognitive impairment is allso cited as a contra indication for ambulatory care .58,62,65 However, patients 25 may have access to stable support services and ambulatory clinic s may have the staff or resources 26 necessary to manage a patient 's withdrawal safely and effectively. Mild cognitive impairment is not an 27 exclusionary factor for ambulatory care. Patients with a moderate cognitiv e impairment should not be 28 managed in Level 1 -WM settings, but moderate cognitive imparment is not a reason to exclude patients 29 from Level 2 -WM settings. Patients with severe cognitive impairment should be managed in inpatient 30 settings.21,58 The appropriateness of managing patients with moderate or mild cognitive impairment in any 31 setting depend s on the availability of support services and experience of the treating clinician s. 32 Symptom monitoring 33 Even if not using a validated symptom severity scale, the ability of a patient to communicate with 34 clinicians or a caretaker about their symptoms is critical to the safe and effective management of alcohol 35 withdrawal , particularly in the early stages when symptoms continue to develop . A communication 36 difficulty due to a language barrier, a hearing or speech difficulty, or other non -withdrawal symptom 37 related cause is not a reason to exclude patients from ambulatory settings. The appropriateness of treating 38 patients with these difficulties will depend on staff capabilities and available accommodation services. 39 Because patients are not on -site for the whole day, the absence of a reliable caregiver such as family or 40 friends willing to monitor signs and symptoms at home has been cited as a contraindication for 41 66 LEVEL OF CARE DETERMINATION ambulatory withdrawal management .65,73 However, the absence of a reliable caregiver to monitor 1 withdrawal at home is not a reason to exclude patients from ambulatory management. The 2 appropriateness will depend on the need to monitor signs and symptoms and other factors that influence 3 treatment adherence and maintenance. 4 Recovery/living environment 5 A patient's recovery and living environment is a consideration when determining level of care . These 6 considerations fall into three categories: the presence of social support, access to safe housing and 7 transportation, and ability to visit the clinic frequently during withdrawal management (which may be 8 complicated by available transportation, but also employment, childcare, etc .). The absence of a social 9 support network is commonly cited as an indication for inpatient treatment .62 However, the absence of a 10 reliable social support network is not a reason to exclude patients from ambulatory management , and 11 appropriate ness will depend on a patient's access to other resources . Patient s with family or friends who 12 are not supportive of or oppose the withdrawal management process should not be managed in a Level 1 - 13 WM setting. The assumption is that patient s have contact with those family or friends and their opposition 14 will be detrimental to the withdrawal process. Having f amily or friends who are not supportive of or 15 oppose the withdrawal management process is not a reason to exclude patietns from Level 2 -WM 16 setting s. Increased hours of clinic attendance will reduce contact with oppositional family and friends. 17 Patients in Level 2 -WM settings also have greater access to AUD treatment services, which can help 18 patients address interpersonal problems and teach coping mechanisms. 19 It is not appropriate to manage alcohol withdrawal in an ambulator y setting if patient s are unable to 20 access or ar range for safe housing .21,58,65 It is also not appropriate to manage alcohol withdrawal in an 21 ambulatory setting if patients are unable to access or arrange for transportation to the treatment setting. 22 The inability to come to the treatment setting daily is not a reason to ex clude patients from ambulatory 23 settings. An alternative to daily visits for these patients may involve alternating in person clinic visits with 24 consultation s with a qualified clinician every other day via phone or video conference (see IV.A : 25 Monitoring ). 26 Risk of harm and use 27 A patient's likelihood of completing ambulatory withdrawal treatment and of refraining from alcohol use 28 has been cited as a factor s for determining level of care in prior guidelines.12,58,62 Patients being treated in 29 ambulatory settings have greater access to and are at greater risk for using alcohol and other drugs during 30 alcohol withdrawal management compared to patients in an inpatient withdrawal treatment setting. When 31 alcohol is combined with medications such as benzodiazepines, which are used t o treat alcohol 32 withdrawal symptoms, it can be particularly dangerous to patients. The ASAM Criteria12 uses the concept 33 of imminent danger (gravity of consequences to self/others) to categorize the proximity and likelihood of 34 consequences and need for structured services and continuous monitoring . Ambulatory withdrawal 35 management is not appropriate for uncooperative or unreliable patients who are at imminent risk of harm . 36 Patients with an uncertain level of cooper ation or reliability, with a low level of commitment to the 37 withdrawal process, or who are at significant risk of imminent return to alcohol use should not be 38 managed in Level 1 -WM setting s. Such patients are not excluded from management in evel 2 -WM 39 settings, but their risk should be carefully considered . Level 2 -WM settings can provide a structured, 40 monitored environment for such patients. 41 67 AMBULATORY MANAGEMENT IV. Ambulatory Management of Alcohol Withdrawal 1 This guideline divides recommendations on the management of alco hol withdrawal into two broad 2 categories where withdrawal management services are provided: ambulatory and inpatient settings . While 3 there are many differences in the services provided within these categories, and services should not 4 ideally be tied to a s pecific setting, this organization follows a reasonable structure that seems to match 5 how providers currently think about their practice context. The goal is that practitioners can reference one 6 management section or the other . There are many shared servic e practices across categories , however, 7 which creates a great deal of repetition across sections. This organization was intentional . As most readers 8 do not read through an entire guideline, the goal was to ensure that each section stands on its own. 9 Within each section, differences between levels of care are highlighted . In ambulatory settings, Level 1 - 10 WM is ambulatory withdrawal management without extended on -site monitoring. This service can be 11 carried out in a physician's office, by a home health ca re agency, or an addiction treatment facility. Level 12 2-WM is ambulatory withdrawal management with extended on -site monitoring. It can be carried out in 13 structured outpatient settings such as a day hospital setting, a general health care or mental health f acility, 14 or an addiction treatment facility. Level 2 -WM is an organized service with the capacity to provide 15 regular medical assessments and monitor alcohol withdrawal progression. Level 2 -WM settings may also 16 provide access to psychological or psychiatric treatment (see The ASAM Criteria for additional details). 17 The following recommendations apply to both Level 1 -WM and Level 2 -WM settings unless otherwise 18 specified. Additional recommendations specific to Primary Care settings are included in the section 19 VII.A : Primary Care . 20 A. Monitoring 21 Recommendation IV.1: In ambulatory settings, arrange for patients to check in with a qualified health 22 provider (e.g., medical assistant, nurse) daily for up to five days following cessation of (or reduction in) 23 alcohol use. For some patients who are unable to attend daily in -person check -ins, alternating in -person 24 visits with remote check -ins via phone or video call is an appropriate alternative. 25 Recommendation IV.2: Re-assessment s should focus on the patient's health since the last checkup. 26 Clinicians should assess general physical condition, vital signs, hydration, orientation, sleep and 27 emotional status including suicidal thoughts at each visit . Ask about alcohol and other substance use and, 28 if available, measur e Blood Alcohol Contend ( BAC ) with a breathalyzer to detect recent alcohol use. 29 Recommendation IV.3: Alcohol withdrawal severity should be monitor ed with a validated instrumen t 30 (see Appendix III for a summary of scale s and their associated features) . Patients who are able to monitor 31 their own signs and symptoms may use an instrument designed for self -administration such as the Short 32 Alcohol Withdrawal Scale ( SAWS ). 33 Recommendation IV.4: In ambulatory settings, patients with a current or past benzodiazepine use 34 disorder need additional monitoring. 35 68 AMBULATORY MANAGEMENT Recommendation IV.5: For patients managed in an ambulatory setting, the following indications would 1 necessitate transfer t o a more intensive level of care such as Level 2 -WM (if in a Level 1 -WM setting) or 2 an inpatient setting: 3 Agitation or severe tremor ha s not resolved despite having received multiple doses of medication, 4 and the patient will not be continually monitored ( e.g., treatment setting is closing) 5 More severe signs or symptoms develop such as persistent vomiting, marked agitation, 6 hallucinations, confusion , or seizure 7 Existing medical or psychiatric conditions worsen 8 Patient appear s over-sedated 9 Patient return s to alcohol use 10 Syncope, unstable vital signs (low /high blood pressure , low/high heart rate ) 11 Discussion 12 One of the key differences between the Level 1 -WM and Level 2 -WM levels of care is the frequency and 13 intensity of monitoring they provide . Optimal monitoring frequency is a balance between clinical need 14 and feasibility. While b road ranges of recommended optimal monitoring frequency were found in the 15 literature, the modal recommendation seemed to be daily .62,75,76 Face-to-face che ck-ins with a qualified 16 health care provider are preferred. Patients who are unable to come to the treatment setting on a daily basis 17 can be assess ed on alternate days via phone or video conference if assessment using that method would 18 not increase the risk of unsafe withdrawal .62 This practice might be reserved for patients in mild 19 withdrawal or who are nearing completion of withdrawal and for patients who have demonstrated 20 commitment to the withdrawal management process. The decision to monitor a patient's progress 21 remotely is at the discretion of the clinician. 22 Monitoring a patient in alcohol withdrawal should include multiple indicators of withdrawal progress and 23 patient health. This include s the patient's general physical and mental health including vital signs, 24 emotional status and sleep quality .76 Clinicians should ensure that the patient is following directions 25 regarding hydration and nutrition (see IV.B : Supportive Care for instructions ). The worsening of medical 26 or mental health conditions or circumstances that interfere with a patient's ability to correct fluid, 27 electrolyte , or nutritional deficiencies indicates the need to reinforce self -care instructions and reassess a 28 patient's treatment plan and/or level of care . If not included in the withdrawal symptom monitoring scale, 29 orientation sho uld be assessed as an indication of withdrawal severity, possible alcohol or other substance 30 use, and over -sedation from prescribed withdrawal medication. 31 The patient should be asked about alcohol and other drug use at each follow up appointment. If feasible, a 32 breathalyzer should be used to verify that the patient ha s not been using alcohol recently .71 A breath 33 alcohol test can detect use for approximately 1 hour per standard unit of alcohol consumed, so a negative 34 result does not guarantee the patient has not consumed alcohol since the ir last appointm ent.3 A positive 35 result, if the test is properly administered, does indicate that the patient has alcohol in their system . This is 36 particularly important to know if prescribing medication that is dangerous to use in combination with 37 alcohol (i.e., be nzodiazepines or phenobarbital ). Alcohol use may indicate that the patient is not receiving 38 an adequate dose of medicatio n to ease discomfort from withdrawal and/or reduce cravings . It also 39 indicates a clinician should choose a medication for withdrawal with a tolerable safety profile when used 40 in combination with alcohol. It may also indicate that there are circumstances in the patient's environment 41 that make it difficult to avoid alcohol and that an inpatient setting is more likely to lead to successful 42 withdrawal manage ment. I n this case, i t is important that alcohol use not lead to ejection from treatment, 43 but rather transfer to a more intensive level of care . The Guideline Committee added that patients with 44 69 AMBULATORY MANAGEMENT current or past benzodiazepine use disorder will need more intensive monitoring during alcohol 1 withdrawal management. 2 The severity of alcohol withdrawal should be monitored using a validated withdrawal scale .37,38,56,57,62 The 3 same instrument should ideally be used to track signs and symptoms throughout the course of 4 withdrawal .71 Clinicians should ensure that signs and symptoms are not worsening, that patients are 5 responding as expected to medication if provided, and that signs and symptoms are not persisting beyond 6 the expected timeline o f withdrawal. Any of these indicate the need to reassess a patient's treatment plan 7 and/or level of care . 8 As discussed in the section II.D. Symptom Assessment Scale s, various symptom assessment and 9 monitoring scale s have been de veloped to address circumstances such as a confounding illness or 10 symptom self -reporting barriers (see Appendix III Ifor a summary of scale s and their associated features). 11 Of most relevance to scale choice in ambulatory settings is clinician - vs. self -administration. While t he 12 CIWA -Ar was designed to be administered by a clinician, it can be used by patients or caregivers if given 13 adequate i nstructions . The SAWS , a 10-item instrument designed to be self -administered, can be used as a 14 supplement while the patient is away from the treatment setting. It has been used and validated in 15 ambulatory settings .61,77,78 Unlike the CIWA -Ar, which is designed to measure in -the-moment signs and 16 symptoms, t he SAWS is an up -to-the-moment measure of symptoms in the prior few hours . It was 17 originally written to measure symptoms during the prior 24 hours in patients returning for a daily clinic 18 appointment , although the developers state that the assessment period can be adjusted to whatever is 19 needed , for example, tracking nighttime symptoms while away from the more extensive monitoring of a 20 Level 2 -WM setting .61 21 While most patients with alcohol withdrawal can be successfully managed in an ambulatory setting, it is 22 important to recognize signs that a more intensive level of care is needed . Patients and caregivers should 23 be informed of warning signs to look for while away from the treatment setting, and that safe alcohol 24 withdrawal management may necessitate transfer to a more intensive level of care if cer tain indications 25 emerge (see the following section, IV.B : Supportive Care for patient and caregiver instructions ). In 26 settings with less frequent monitoring such as primary care, the threshold for transfer to a more intensive 27 level of care is lower than in settings with more frequent monitoring. If signs or symptoms such as 28 persistent vomiting, agitation, hallucinations , or confusion develop, patien ts should be transferred to an 29 inpatient setting as they can presage the onset of electrolyte disturbance, withdrawal seizures, alcohol 30 withdrawal delirium, or Wernicke encephalopath y.79,80 If an existing medical or psychiatric condition 31 worsens despite adequate control of withdrawal symptoms, patients should be transferred to a setting with 32 the resources to manage the condition .73,80 If significant signs or symptoms such as agitation are present 33 despite having received multiple doses of medication or if the patient appears over -sedated at the close of 34 the day , transfer to a setting where the patient can continue to be observed , such as the Emergency 35 Department ( ED) or a special ized withdrawal management setting , is warranted .72 Signs of over -sedation 36 include respiratory depression, ataxia, confusion, memory impairment, and delirium. If the patient 37 experience s a loss of consciousness or has unsta ble vital signs t hat cannot be attribut ed to and controlled 38 for by the prescribed treatment regimen, patients should be transferred to a level of care capable of 39 providing the patient with a thorough assessment to properly identify etiology of signs and sy mptoms as 40 well as provide continuous observation and care. 41 70 AMBULATORY MANAGEMENT B. Supportive Care 1 Recommendation IV. 6: Supportive care is a critical component of alcohol withdrawal management. 2 Providers should ensure patients are educated about what to expect over the course of withdrawal, 3 including common signs and symptoms and how they will be treated. 4 Recommendation IV.7: When treating patients in ambulatory settings, providers should ensure 5 patients/caregivers are educated about monitoring for the development of more severe withdrawal and 6 instructed to create a low -stimulation, reassuring environment at home to promote an effective outcome. 7 Recommendation IV.8: Patients should be advised to drink non -caffeinate d fluids and that a daily 8 multivitamin may be beneficial . 9 Recommendation IV.9: Patients can be offered oral thiamine . Typical dosing is 100 mg PO per day for 10 3-5 days. 11 Recommendation IV.10: Clinicians must explain the importance of taking medications as prescribed and 12 confirm the patient 's understanding. 13 Recommendation IV.11: Communicate that safe alcohol withdrawal management may necessitate a 14 transfer to a more intensive level of care including to an inpatient setting and secure the patient's 15 agreement to transfer if there are indications that management in the ambulatory setting is not safe or 16 effective. See Recommendation IV.5 for indications for transfer to a more intensive level of care. 17 Discussion 18 Supportive non-pharmacologic care is a critical component of alcohol withdrawal management. 19 Informing patients of what to expect over the course of treatment, offering reassurance, providing a quiet 20 environment and ensuring adequate hydration and nutrition are important aspects of supportive care in all 21 settings. The importance of supportive fam ily members and /or other caregivers is most relevant to the 22 discussion of ambulatory alcohol withdrawal management as patients will spend a portion of their time at 23 home . Several reviews of ambulatory withdrawal management highlight the role of these indiv iduals as 24 not only one of monitoring signs and symptoms and medication intake, but of offering encouragement 25 and reassurance. 26 Patients and caregivers should be instructed on how to monitor for worsening signs and symptoms 27 including worsening anxiety, inso mnia and suicidal thoughts. If using a withdrawal severity scale, 28 patients and caregivers should be instructed on how it should be completed .81,82 Important information to 29 convey is the precise meaning of clinical or other terms used in the scale, for example, what constitutes 30 sleep disturbance. It should also be made clear how to score the severity of items, for example, what the 31 meaningful difference is between scoring a 1 (Mild) and a 2 (Moderate) on the restlessness item of the 32 SAWS. The instruction period is also an opportunity to evaluate ci rcumstances that may interfere with 33 scale self-administration, for example through literacy problems or confusion about item severity scores .61 34 Patients and caregivers should be instructed to create a low stimulation, reassuring environment, since 35 environment is a critical component of success in alcohol withdrawal managemen t and ultimately 36 recovery .83 As volume depletion is a common condition for patients with alcoh ol withdrawal and 37 intravenous fluids are not provided in ambulatory settings, encouraging consumption of non -caffeinated 38 fluids is important .36,65,76 Nutritional support is also a consideration in ambulatory alcohol withdrawal 39 management. Some patients may benefit from a daily multivitamin and thiamine supplement . Typical 40 71 AMBULATORY MANAGEMENT dosing of oral thiamine is 100 mg PO daily for three to five days.65 However, oral thiamine is not well 1 absorbed , and th iamine deficiencies can typically be corrected through diet. If Wernicke encephal opathy 2 is suspected, the patient should be transferred to an inpatient setting and receive immediate parenteral 3 administration of thiamine. 4 5 and Wernicke -Korsakoff Syndrome84,85 Wernicke encephalopathy is a severe complication resulting from insufficient thiamine in the body. An often reversible acute confusional state characterizes it. Patients consuming large volumes of alcohol are at an increased risk of developing Wernicke encephalopathy due to inadequate nutrition as well as biological interactions between cellular functioning and alcohol. Thiamine is required for carbohydrate metabolism and plays a key role in normal b ody functioning. A thiamine deficiency can lead to an increase in pyruvic acid, impaired oxygen uptak e, and cerebral tissue damage. Because the body does not synthesize thiamine, daily ingestion through food or supplements is required to mainta in adequate metabolic functioning. Thiamine must be converted to different forms to function properly, and alcohol can also impact this convers ion by inhibiting key enzymes. Patients with a thiamine deficiency often present with symptoms such as confusion , abnormal gaze patterns or nystagmus, ataxia, and possibly delirium. Patients who experience alcohol withdrawal syndrome are at risk of developing Wernicke encephalopathy. Thus, routine practice includes providing patients with thiamine supplements as a p reventative measure. If left untreated, Wernicke encephalopathy can progress to chronic Korsakoff syndrome. While Wernicke encephalopathy is a reversible confusional state, if left untreated it can progress to an irreversible syndrome that includes dementi a and gait abnormalities. The prevalence of this syndrome ranges between 0 -2% worldwide and is not connected to alcohol consumption per capita. Effects of the thiamine deficiency can be found throughout the brain. The damage associated with Wernicke -Korsak off syndrome seems to occur in a combination of areas including the mammillary bodies, the cerebellum, the frontal lobe, the periaqueductal gray, the thalamus, the walls of the third ventricle , and the floor of the fourth ventricle. Damage to these structu res yields the defining features found in the clinical exam consisting of ocular disturbances, mental status changes, gait abnormalities, agitation, and confabulations. Unfortunately, once Wernicke -Korsakoff syndrome occurs, the effects are not reversible and are often progressive. 6 In an early review of ambulatory alcohol withdrawal management , it was explicitly recommended that 7 medications should be administered in the treatment setting rather than at home when possible.39 8 However, this recommendation has not been repeated in more recent work, and concerns can be 9 addressed by providing only a few take -home doses at a time and ensuring patients understand how to 10 self-administer med ications properly. Instructions on warnings for specific medications will be addressed 11 in a later section. Most importantly, p atients should be advised about the risk of impairment or overdose if 12 certain medications are combined with alcohol or other substances .7,36 13 Finally, it is important to explain to patients and caregivers the circumstances under which a transfer to a 14 more intensive level of care may be necessary, for example if signs and symptoms continue to increase in 15 severity despite taking medication as prescribed . See Recommendation IV.5 for indications for transfer to 16 a more intensive level of care. Explaining this at the beginning of the withdrawal management process is 17 optimal to ensure a smooth transition if necessary. 18 72 AMBULATORY MANAGEMENT C. AUD Treatment Initiation and Engagement 1 Recommendation IV.12: When feasible, alcohol use disorder (AUD) treatment should be initiated 2 concurrently with alcohol withdrawal management as cognitive status permits. If appropriate , clinicians 3 should offer to initiate pharmacotherapy for AUD as cognitive status permits. If not initiating AUD 4 treatment themselves, clinicians should explain the range of evidence -based treatment services available 5 in the community, and engage patients with these options. In addition, clinicians may offer information 6 about local recovery support groups, including 12 -step groups. 7 Discussion 8 To the fullest extent possible, patients undergoing alcohol withdrawal management should be engaged, if 9 not initiated, in treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD) as soon as cognitive status permits. This 10 engagement should be considered part of the withdrawal management process and should not be delayed 11 until withdrawal management is complete. There are currently no evidence -based practices for addressing 12 AUD as part of a lcohol withdrawal management . 13 In early discussions of ambulatory alcohol withdrawal management, it was recognized that AUD outreach 14 and case management is important for patients .39 In a now-classic study comparing inpatient and 15 outpatient alcohol withdrawal management, it was noted that patients benefit from receiving treatment for 16 AUD in the same outpatient facility at which they complete alcohol withdrawal management.86 As 17 patients in ambulatory settings typically have less severe withdrawal syndromes, treatment initiation and 18 engagement can begin closer to initiating withdrawal management . When discussing AUD, emphasize 19 patient engagement, and offer a variety of treatment and support options, even if the current goal is not 20 abstinence from alcohol. Patients undergoing ambulatory alcohol withdrawal management in a setting 21 such as primary care represent a less \"captive\" audience, and therefore more commitment may be needed 22 from clinician s to engage patients in continuing treatment. Motivational interviewing or enhancement , 23 delivered in primary care settings , has been demonstrated to reduce alcohol and other drug use and to help 24 engage patients in AUD treatment.87,88 Regular follow -up visits at least mont hly for a year in Level 1 -WM 25 settings may increase the chances of continued recovery , although the Guideline Committee 26 acknowledged that this may not always be realistic. 27 D. Pharmacotherapy 28 (1) Prophylaxis 29 Recommendation IV.13: Patients at risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal or 30 complications of alcohol withdrawal may be treated in ambulatory settings at the discretion of providers 31 with extensive experience in management of alcohol withdrawal. Such patients should be provided with 32 preventative pharmacotherapy . Benzodiazepines are first -line treatment because of their well -documented 33 effectiveness in reducing the signs and symptoms of withdrawal including the incidence of seizure and 34 delirium. Phenobarbital is an appropriate alternative in Level 2 -WM setting for providers experi enced 35 with its use . For patients with a contraindication for benzodiazepine use, phenobarbital (in Level 2 -WM 36 settings by providers experienced with its use) or transfer to a more intensive level of care are appropriate 37 options. 38 73 AMBULATORY MANAGEMENT Recommendation IV.14: A front loading regimen is recommended for patients at high risk of severe 1 withdrawal syndrome. Providing at least a single dose of preventative medication is appropriate for 2 patients at lower levels of risk who have: 3 A history of severe or complicated withdrawal 4 An acute medic al, psychiatric , or surgical illness 5 Severe coronary artery disease 6 Displaying signs or symptoms of withdrawal concurrent with a positive blood alcohol content 7 Recommendation IV.15: Patients at risk of developing new or worsening signs or symptoms of 8 withdrawal while away from the ambulatory treatment setting should be provided with pharmacotherapy . 9 Some indications of risk include a history of withdrawal episodes of at least moderate severity and being 10 within the window for the development of symptoms in the time course of withdrawal. Benzodiazepines, 11 carbamazepine , or gabapentin are all appropriate options for monotherapy . Providing at least a single dose 12 of benzodiazepine followed by ongoing treatment according to symptom severity is also appropriate. If 13 the risk of developing worse withdrawal is unknown, patients should be reassessed frequently over the 14 next 24 hours to monitor their need for withdrawal medication. 15 Discussion 16 Determining r isk of developing severe or complicated withdrawal or complications of withdrawal is 17 addressed in section II: Initial Assessment of Alcohol Withdrawal . As discussed in section III: Level of 18 Care Determination , if there is a risk that patients will develop severe or complicated withdrawal or 19 complications of withdrawal, it should first be determined if ambulatory care is the appropriate level of 20 care. Some providers with extensive experience in managing alcohol withdrawal may decide to treat at - 21 risk patients in ambulatory settings . 22 Patients at risk of developing severe or complicated withdrawal or complications of withdrawal should 23 receive pharmacotherapy as soon as possible to prevent these signs and symptoms.4,13,89 Benzodiazepines 24 are recom mended as the primary medication to prevent the development of severe, complicated or 25 complications of withdrawal . There is clear evidence that benzodiazepines reduce the incidence of alcohol 26 withdrawal seizures and alcohol withdrawal delirium.2,13,44,51,90 Phenobarbital can be used as an alternative 27 in Level 2 -WM settings , particularly for patients with a contraindication for benzodiazepine use. 28 However, given its narrow therapeutic window and extended half -life, it should only be used by clinicians 29 experienced with its use, parti cularly in ambulatory settings where patients have greater likelihood of 30 exposure to alcohol. 31 For patients at high risk of severe withdrawal, front loading with a benzodiazepine is recommended to 32 rapidly achieve therapeutic levels of medication. Front loa ding has been shown to reduce the duration of 33 treatment and incidence of withdrawal seizure and duration of delirium.2,13,91 Patients should be closely 34 observed for over -sedation and respiratory depression following the administration of a front loading 35 dose. 36 For patients at lower levels of risk, providing at least a single or a few doses of benzodiazepine is 37 appropriate and can be followed by a medication chosen according to symptom severity (see IV.D(2) : 38 Withdrawal symptoms ). If a clinician determines that a patient is no longer at risk, for example, because 39 risk has been sufficiently mitigated by admini stration of medication or because the course of withdrawal 40 has passed the period of acute risk, ongoing pharmacotherapy for alcohol withdrawal can be determined 41 according to the severity of a patient's withdrawal at that time. Some situations which have be en called 42 out as appropriate for administer ing at least a single dose of benzodiazepines include : a history of severe 43 74 AMBULATORY MANAGEMENT or complicated withdrawal ; risk for complications of significant medical, surgical , or psychiatric illness 1 (particularly cardiovascular di sease including coronary artery disease );4 and displaying signs or symptoms 2 of withdrawal concurrent with a positive blood alcohol content (an indication of risk for developing 3 severe withdrawal syndrome ). 4 A concern in ambulatory withdrawal management is the lack of continuous observation of patients to 5 identify worsening withdrawal syndrome and provide medication to address symptoms if needed. P atients 6 experiencing mi ld alcohol withdrawal (e.g., CIWA -Ar score <10) who are at low risk of developing 7 severe, complicated , or complications of withdrawal can be managed with supportive non - 8 pharmacotherapy in both ambulatory and inpatient settings (see Recommendations IV.16 and V.15). In 9 the ambulatory setting, clinicians may want to use med ication to prevent the emergence of mild or 10 worsening to moderate withdrawal while patients are away from the clinic, meaning the severity threshold 11 for prescribing medication is lower in ambulatory settings than inpatient settings, particularly if there i s an 12 indication of risk for symptom development. The recommendation that patients with even very mild 13 withdrawal who cannot be monitored be provided medication has been supported in prior guidelines.51 14 Risk of developing more severe withd rawal is determined, in part, by the severity of previous withdrawal 15 episodes as well as timing (within the 6 -36 hour window ) of the emergence, peak, and resolution of 16 withdrawal signs and symptoms after cessation of (or reduction in) alcohol consumption.2 While 17 withdrawal tends to worsen with each episode, patients with repeated bouts of mild alcohol withdrawal 18 have reported similar signs and symptoms for each episode.46 19 Sometimes the risk of withdrawal progression i s unknown, for example, if patients have not had prior 20 withdrawal episodes or do not know the exact timing of their last drink. It is appropr iate to either provide 21 medication or reassess the patient frequently over the next 24 hours, after which more serio us withdrawal 22 is unlikely to develop.62 Reassessment can be done in person or over the phone or video chat . 23 Benzodiazepines, carbamazepine , or gabapentin are app ropriate options for managing patients at risk of 24 developing mild or moderate withdrawal. These medications are also appropriate for patients already 25 experiencing mild and moderate withdrawal as seen in the next section. As in the case of risk of 26 developing severe, complicated , or complications of withdrawal , a dose or doses of a benzodiazepine 27 followed by ongoing treatment according to symptom severity is also appropriate. 28 (2) Withdrawal symptoms 29 Recommendation IV.16: Patien ts experiencing mild alcohol withdrawal (e.g., CIWA -Ar score <10) who 30 are at minimal risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal or complicatio ns of alcohol 31 withdrawal may be provided pharmacotherapy or supportive care alone. If providing medication, 32 carbamazepine or gabapentin are appropriate options. For patients who are at risk of developing new or 33 worsening withdrawal while away from the treatment setting , benzodiazepines, carbamazepine , or 34 gabapentin are appropriate. 35 Recommendation IV.17: Patients experiencing moderate alcohol withdrawal (e.g., CIWA -Ar scores 10 - 36 18) should receive pharmacotherapy Benzodiazepines are first-line treatment . Carbamazepine or 37 are appropriate alternatives . For patients with a contraindication benzodiazepine use , carbamazepine, gabapentin , or phenobarbital (in Level 2 -WM settings for provider s experienced with its 39 use) are appropriate. Carbamazepine, gabapentin , or valproic acid (if no liver disease or childbearing 40 potential) may be used as an adjunct to benzodiazepines . 41 75 AMBULATORY MANAGEMENT Recommendation IV.18: Patients experiencing severe , but not complicated , alcohol withdrawal (e.g., 1 CIWA -Ar 19) , may be treated in ambulatory Level 2 -WM settings at the discretion of providers with 2 extensive experience in management of alcohol withdrawal. Suc h patients should receive 3 pharmacotherapy . Benzodiazepines are first -line treatment . Phenobarbital is an appropriate alternative for 4 providers experienced with its use. For patients with a contraindication for benzod iazepine use, 5 phenobarbital, carbamazepine , or gabapentin are appropriate. The use of adjunct medications is also 6 appropriate. 7 Recommendation IV.19: If a patient is taking medication as prescribed and symptoms are not controlled 8 as expected : 9 First, consider increasing the dose 10 If over -sedation or inadequate monitoring is a concern: 11 Reassess for appropriate level of care 12 Consider switching medication s 13 If using benzodiazepines, c onsider adding an adjunct medication 14 Discussion 15 Appropriate pharmacotherapy for alcohol withdrawal managed i n an ambulatory setting is a balance of 16 alleviating symptoms enough to minimize the likelihood that patients will return to alcohol use and the 17 possibility they will experience negative side effects or other negative outcomes due to medication use . 18 Patients experiencing mild withdrawal (e.g., CIWA -Ar score <10) can be treated with pharmacotherapy 19 or supportive therapy alone if they are not at risk of symptom progression. Patients experiencing moderate 20 or severe withdrawal (e.g., CIWA -Ar scores 10) s hould receive pharmacotherapy. 21 Carbamazepine or gabapentin are appropriate for managing mild and moderate alcohol withdrawal in 22 patients who are at minimal risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal.92-94 There is 23 evidence that carbamazepine and gabapentin are as effective as benzodiazepines as monotherapy for low - 24 risk patients44,94 -96 and they have cha racteristics which increase their favorability compared to 25 benzodiazepines and phenobarbital in ambulatory settings. They have lower risk for drug -alcohol toxicity 26 and are less sedating compared to benzodiazepines and phenobarbital.58,62,73,92 Carbamazepine and 27 gabapentin have been shown to decrease craving for alcohol and reduce alcohol consumption after the 28 withdrawal period.92 This may make them particularly beneficial for patients treated in ambulatory 29 settings where the opportunity for exposure to alcohol is greater. 30 As symptom severity or risk of developing severe symptoms increases , medications with well -established 31 effectiven ess in preventing the incidence of severe and complicated withdrawal are preferred.54 32 Benzodiazepines are first -line agents for treating moderate58,65,81 and severe alcohol withdrawal13,58 due to 33 their known effectiveness in preventing seizures and delirium.13,90,94 Carbamazepine, gabapentin and 34 phenobarbital can be used for patients with a contraindication for benzodiazepine use.58,65,81 ,92 However, 35 given its narrow therapeutic window and extended half -life, phenobarbital should only be used in Level 2 - 36 WM settings by clinicians experienced with its use, particularly in ambulatory settings wher e patients 37 have greater likelihood of exposure to alcohol. 38 76 AMBULATORY MANAGEMENT As discussed in section III: Level of Care Determination , if patients are experiencing severe withdrawal 1 (e.g., CIWA -Ar 19) , it should first be determined if ambulatory treatment is the appropriate level of 2 care. Some ambulatory providers with extensive experience in managing alcohol withdrawal may decide 3 to treat patients experienci ng severe withdrawal in the absence of confusion or hallucinations indicative of 4 delirium or seizure during the current withdrawal episode in a Level 2 -WM ambulatory setting. 5 Benzodiazepines are first -line treatment, but phenobarbital is an appropriate alt ernative for providers 6 experienced with its use, even if benzodiazepine use is not contraindicated. 7 Patients receiving pharmacotherapy should be monitored for signs of 8 response to medication. If patients do not respond as expected, a number 9 of actions can be considered. First, consider increasing the dose. The 10 amount of medication required to control symptoms is variable and 11 ultimately determined by clinical judgment. Patients with more severe 12 withdrawal may require larger doses than are typically seen in o ther 13 patient populations, particularly during early withdrawal. Providing large 14 doses of benzodiazepine can lead to over -sedation and respiratory 15 depression and patients should be monitored closely. 16 Second, p atients should be reassessed for appropriate level of care . 17 Failure to respond may reflect the presence of more severe withdrawal 18 than expected and significant risk of major complications .13 A more 19 intensive level of care may be needed to monitor and manage major 20 complications if they occur.82 21 Third, consider switching t o a different medication. Failure to respond to 22 benzodiazepine may reflect benzodiazepine resistance due to kindling 23 (see VI.D : Resistant Alcohol Withdrawal ). Higher number s of previous 24 alcohol withdrawal episodes is associated with decreased responsiveness to benzodiazepines.4 Failure to 25 respond may also be due to withdrawal from another GABAergic agent such as gabapentin . In these 26 cases, switching to an alternative medication should be considered. 27 Fourth, if using benzodiazepines, consider adding an adjunct medication. Some patients benefit from the 28 addition of an adjunct medication to control signs and symptoms of withdrawal and their use can be 29 considered as part of the treatment plan . The use of carbamazepine, gabapentin , or valproic acid as an 30 adjunct medication to benzodiazepines is also appropriate for patients experiencing moderate or severe 31 withdrawal. Valproic acid should not be used in patients who have liver disease, with women of 32 childbearing potential, or as monotherapy for withdrawal. Alpha2 -adrenergic agonists (A2AAs) and beta - 33 adrenergic antagonist (beta -blockers) can be used in conjunction with benzodiazepines to manage 34 persistent hypertension or tachycardia.44,97 35 (3) Benzodiazepine use 36 Recommendation IV. 20: While no particular benzodiazepine agent is more effective than another, 37 longer-acting benzodiazepines are the preferred agent s due to the clinical benefits of their longer duration 38 of action . 39 Recommendation IV.21: If waiting for lab test(s) results or if the test(s) are unavailable, if a patient has 40 signs of significant liver disease , use a benzodiazepine with less hepatic metabolization. 41 Considerations for patients with a slow response to medication. 1) Increasing the dose 2) Reassess for appropriate level of care , including presence of concurrent conditions 3) Switch medications 4) Consider adding an adjunct medication 77 AMBULATORY MANAGEMENT Recommendation IV.22: Clinicians s hould monitor patients taking benzodiazepines for signs of over- 1 sedation and respiratory depression . 2 Recommendation IV.23: A benzodiazepine prescri ption to treat alcohol withdrawal should be 3 discontinued following treatment . 4 Recommendation IV.24: Clinician s can manage benzodiazepine misuse or diversion risk in ambulatory 5 settings by dispensing or prescribing the minimum amount necessary given patients ' level of stability and 6 timing of their next in -person clinic visit . Alternative medications can also be considered such as 7 carbamazepine or gabapentin. 8 Recommendation IV.2 5: In ambulatory settings, benzodiazepines should not be prescribed to patient s 9 with a history of even mild adverse events with benzodiazepine use because rapid intervention is not 10 typically available . Benzodiazepines can be used with caution in patients with a high risk of 11 benzodiazepine diversion including patients with a current or past benzodiazepine use disorder for the 12 short period of acute alcohol withdrawal. Risk can be managed by dispensing or prescribing a small 13 number of doses . 14 Recommendation IV.26: Patients who are taking benzodiazepines , and their caregivers , should be 15 educated regarding: 16 The danger of drug -drug interactions between benzodia zepines and other CNS depressants 17 (impairment and respiratory depression ) 18 The risks associated with combining alcohol and benzodiazepines and importance of abstinence 19 from alcohol 20 The risks associated with driving or use of heavy machinery for the first few days of 21 benzodiazepine administration 22 Instructions to reduce their benzodiazepine dose if drowsiness occurs 23 Discussion 24 Benzodiazepines are commonly recommended as first -line agents for managing most forms of alc ohol 25 withdrawal.13,90 Diazepam, lorazepam and chlordiazepoxide are the most frequently used in treating 26 alcohol withdrawal. While there is no evidence sh owing superiority of effectiveness among 27 benzodiazepine agents,13,90 longer -acting agents are preferred by many clinicians.2,51,81 A long duration of 28 action contribut es to a smoother course of withdrawal and greater control of breakthrough and rebound 29 signs or symptoms. This provides greater coverage for preventing alcohol withdrawal seizures and 30 delirium.90,98 For this reason, patients prescribed a shorter -acting agent should have a more gradual taper 31 and be rea ssessed more frequently (see IV.D(4) : Benzodiazepine dosing regimens ). 32 Longer -acting agents can accumulate and lead to over-sedation and respiratory depression , particularly in 33 older patients or those with compromised health. Other signs of over-sedation include ataxia, confusion, 34 memory impairment, and delirium, which may be difficult to differentiate from alcohol withdrawal - 35 related delirium.2 Benzodiazepine associated delirium has been diagnosed by the administration of 36 flumazenil, a GABA -A receptor antagonist, but this protocol was not reviewed by the Guideline 37 Committee.99 A reduction in the benzodiazepine dose and the addition of a ne uroleptic agent to control for 38 agitation and/or confusion can be considered if patients are not at an elevated risk of seizure (i.e., they are 39 outside of the acute risk window).2 Some neuroleptic agents have been shown t o reduce the seizure 40 threshold. 41 78 AMBULATORY MANAGEMENT Benzodiazepine accumulation is more likely in patients with impaired hepatic function . Medication dose 1 can be reduced or a benzodiazepine with less dependence on hepatic metabolism can be used (see section 2 VII.D . Patients with Medical C onditions ). Laboratory testing r ecommended in section II.E. Identify 3 Concurrent Conditions can indicate the need to adjust the treatment plan , but as treatment should not be 4 delayed while waiting for lab test(s) results or if the test(s) are unavailab le at the treatment setting, if a 5 patient has signs of significant liver disease, reduce the dose or use a benzodiazepine with less hepatic 6 metabolization. 7 8 Signs of significant liver disease include: 9 Skin and eyes that appear yellowish (jaundice) 10 Swellin g in the legs and ankles (edema) 11 Itchy skin 12 Dark urine color 13 Pale stool color, or bloody or tar -colored stool 14 Confusion 15 Chronic fatigue 16 Nausea or vomiting 17 Benzodiazepines prescribed for alcohol withdrawal should be discontinued after withdrawal is complete. 18 Patients are at risk of developing a physiological dependence on benzodiazepines, developing a 19 benzodiazepine use disorder, or experiencing benzodiazepine withdrawal. The decision process for 20 determining appropriate duration of treatment is affec ted by the amount of benzodiazepine used during 21 the acute withdrawal period, particularly when seizure or delirium has occurred, and any associated 22 physiological dependence that may have developed.51 Managing the phenomenon of protracted 23 withdrawal, where subacute symptoms of irritability, anxiety and sleep disturbances can persist for weeks, 24 is beyond the scope of the current guideline. 25 In ambulatory settings, benzodiazepine use has liabilities not present in inpatient settings. Risk can b e 26 managed by dispensing or prescribing very small number of doses , with some suggesting providing only 27 enough medication for one day .38,39,72,100,101 The Clinical Champions determined that recommending daily 28 prescriptions might be too r estrictive and giving enough medication until a patient 's next appointment 29 (e.g., 1-3 three days) is reasonable. They noted that these considerations are relevant primarily for 30 benzodiazepine prescriptions due to the risk involved and t hat they would be comfortable giving several 31 days' worth of carbamazepine o r gabapentin due to lower risk for diversion and/or drug -drug interactions. 32 There are some situations where the risks of benzodiazepine use outweigh the benefits in an ambulatory 33 management setting. In these cases, p atients can be offered an alternative m edication rather than transfer 34 to inpatient treatment. P atients with a history of even mild adverse events with benzodiazepine use should 35 not be prescribed benzodiazepines for ambulatory withdrawal because of the lack of continuous 36 monitoring. 37 Benzodiazep ines should be prescribed with extra caution to some patients if managed by dispensing or 38 prescribing a very small number of doses and more frequent monitoring . Patient s with a high risk of 39 benzodiazepine misuse or diversion (history of previous misuse or diversion or another household 40 member with a history of misuse or diversion of benzodiazepines ) and patient s with a current or past 41 benzodiazepine use disorder can be prescribed benzodiazepines if managed cautiously . The potential for 42 misuse is limited during the short period of supervised alcohol withdrawal .62 43 79 AMBULATORY MANAGEMENT It is critical that patients who are prescribed benzodiazepines and their caregivers understand the danger 1 of drug -drug interactions with this medication .71,100 As respiratory depression and death can result from 2 the combination of alcohol or opioids with benzodiazepines, clinicians should emphasize the importance 3 of not using alcohol or other drugs during withdrawal management .71,100 Patients should also be warned 4 about the risk of drowsiness and advised not to drive or us e heavy machinery for the first few days of 5 taking benzodiazepines .75 Patients should be advised to reduce the dose if drowsiness occurs .41 6 (4) Benzodiazepine dosing regimens 7 Recommendation IV.27: At short -term observational settings with continuous monitoring (e.g. Level 2 - 8 WM) , symptom -triggered treatment conducted by trained staff is the preferred benzodiazepine dosing 9 method. Front loading while under clinical supervision or fixed dosing with additional as -needed 10 medication are also appropriate. 11 Recommendation IV. 28: At settings without extended on -site monitoring (Level 1 -WM) , symptom - 12 triggered dosing is appropriate if patients or a caregiver can reliably monitor signs and symptoms with a 13 withdrawal severity scale and follow dosing guidance. Otherwise, front loading while under clinical 14 supervision or fixed dosing with additional as -needed medication is appropriate. 15 Recommen dation IV.29: Front loading is recommended for patients experiencing severe alcohol 16 withdrawal (e.g., CIWA -Ar 19) . Diazepam and chlordiazepoxide are preferred agents for front loading . 17 Recommendation IV. 30: When using a fixed -dose schedule, patient s' signs and symptoms should still 18 be monitored . A few additional additional take-home doses can be provided to take as needed. When 19 initiating a fixed -dose regimen , arrange for the patients to be followed up with the following day to 20 modify the dose if needed. 21 Recommendation IV. 31: If prescribing a shorter -acting benzo diazepine, using a fixed -dose regimen with 22 a gradual taper may be appropriate to reduce the likelihood of breakthrough and rebound signs and 23 symptoms. 24 Discussion 25 Examples for these dosing regimens can be found in Appendix V. 26 Multiple dosing strategies have been used to administer benzodiazepines during alcohol withdrawal. In 27 general, symptom -triggered treatment is the preferred dosing me thod,4,36 but there is disagreement 28 regarding its appropriateness for ambulatory settings . In this regimen , medication is administered only 29 when patients are experiencing significant withdrawal symptoms according to a severity scale. This 30 allows dosing to be individualized according to symptom severity and reduces the risk of under - and over - 31 treating by assessing and dosing according to real -time symptom severity. It is possible that very large 32 doses of medication will be needed rapidly, and reduced as symptoms resolve.2,13 Symptom -triggered 33 dosing has been shown to reduce the duration of treatment and inpatient length of stay compared to a 34 fixed -dose schedule.2,21,44,51 35 This disagreem ent regarding its appropriateness for ambulatory settings generally hinges on how signs 36 and symptoms will be assessed and by whom. Symptom -triggered treatment is appropriate when 37 conducted by healthcare professionals in Level 2 -WM settings.2,13,21 In Level 1 -WM settings, where 38 symptoms would be assessed by caregivers or patients themselves, most prior guidelines have only 39 80 AMBULATORY MANAGEMENT considered the use of the CIWA -Ar, which requires training in order to score reliably. Other symptom 1 assessment instruments such as the Short Alcohol Withdrawal Scale (SAWS) are designed to be self - 2 administered and used in ambulatory settings.81 Symptom -triggered treatment using the SAWS has been 3 shown to be as safe and effective as a fixed -dose scheduled taper in an open -label RCT of outpatients.78 4 Other sources, including the Guideline Committee, argue that the CIWA -Ar can be administered by 5 patients or caregivers for symptom -triggered treatment if given sufficient instruction.82 If patient s meet 6 criteria for treatment in a Level 1 -WM setting and they or a caregiver can reliably assess signs and 7 symptoms and follow guidance to determine whether a dose is needed, symptom triggered treatment is an 8 appropriate option. 9 Fixed dosing is also appropriate in ambulatory settings. In a fixed -dose regimen , set amounts of 10 medication are administered at regular intervals, and the dose amount, dosing frequency , or both are 11 gradually tapered according to a set schedule. While fixed dosing is easy to administer, over- or 12 underestimating the amount of benzodiazepine needed may lead to insufficient symptom control and 13 over-sedation.26 With fixed dosing , additional take home doses should be provided in the event symptoms 14 are not adequately controlled.58 Fixed -dose regimens do not eliminate the need for frequent monitoring 15 and dose adjustment.7,42 When i nitiating a fixed -dose regimen in an ambulatory setting, patients should be 16 reassessed the next day to modify the dose, if needed. 17 Front loading conducted by trained staff is also appropriate in ambulatory settings and is preferred for 18 patients at risk for or experiencing severe alcohol withdrawal (e.g., CIWA -Ar scores 19) .45,70 Front 19 loading describes when a moderate to high dose of a long -acting benzodi azepine is administered to 20 achieve rapid control of withdrawal signs and symptoms and is allowed to taper through metabolism. 21 Diazepam and chlordiazepoxide are the preferred agents for front loading . This regimen is typically used 22 when rapid administration of a benzodiazepine is required, either because the patient is experiencing 23 significant symptoms or is at risk of developing them. Front loading has been shown to reduce the 24 duration of treatment, incidence of withdrawal seizure, and duration of delirium.102 This effect is usually 25 attributed to the rapid administration of large amounts of benzodiazepines early in the withdrawal 26 period.2,13 A front -loading regimen can be d riven by a withdrawal severity scale (e.g., 10 mg diazepam 27 PO every hour if CIWA -Ar score 10) or according to a fixed schedule (e.g., 20 mg diazepam PO every 28 2 hours for 3 doses). Symptom -triggered front loading has been shown to reduce symptom duration and 29 the amount of benzodiazepine used ,70,103 -106 the incidence of withdrawal seizures, and the duration of 30 delirium for patients being treated in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) .102 Fixed -dose front loading can be 31 used with patients for whom it would be difficult to obtain an accurate score on a withdraw al severity 32 scale. 33 Clinicians should monitor patients closely before and after providing a front loading dose for signs of 34 over-sedation and respiratory depression as doses are more frequent with this regimen .7,42 The need to 35 observe patie nts does not necessarily preclude front loading in a Level 1 -WM setting , as symptoms can 36 often resolve i n as few as 2 -3 doses . 37 Because of their shorter duration of action, short -acting benzodiazepine concentrations can diminish 38 rapidly, increasing the chan ce for rebound and breakthrough symptoms and signs including seizure. For 39 this reason, a fixed -dose schedule with a long taper may be more feasible than a symptom -triggered 40 dosing regimen requiring very frequent reassessment. Shorter -acting benzodiazepines should be tapered 41 carefully even after withdrawal resolves to prevent the development of rebound or breakthrough signs and 42 symptoms. If the CIWA -Ar is used in conju nction with short acting benzodiazepines, the assessments 43 should be done promptly in order to prevent seizures due to protocol errors.98 44 81 AMBULATORY MANAGEMENT (5) Carbamazepine, gabapen tin, valproic acid 1 Recommendation IV.3 2: Gabapentin is a favorable choice for treating alcohol withdrawal when a 2 clinician also plans to use it for a patient's ongoing treatment of alcohol use disorder. 3 Recommendation IV. 33: If benzodiazepines are contrain dicated, carbamazepine or gabapentin IV.3 4: Carbamazepine, gabapentin , or valproic acid may be used as an adjunct to 6 benzodiazepine therapy to help control alcohol withdrawal. Before using as an adjunct, clinicians should 7 ensure that an adequate dose of benzodiazepine has been administered. 8 Recommendation IV.3 5: Valproic acid should not be used in patients who have l iver disease or women 9 of childbearing potential. 10 Recommendation IV.3 6: There is insufficient evidence to support the use of valproic acid as 11 monotherapy for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal. 12 Discussion 13 Evidence sugge sts that anticonvulsants, particularly carbamazepine, are effective at preventing alcohol 14 withdrawal progression, seizures and delirium.4 At this time, there is insufficient evidence to support their 15 use over benzodiazepines for patients at increased risk of severe withdrawal, seizures , or delirium. 16 2,13,38,92,107 As the efficacy of benzodiazepines is well -established, there have been ethical concerns with 17 running placebo -contr olled or treatment -as-usual -controlled (i.e., compared to in 18 at-risk populations.2,92 19 Carbamazepine or gabapentin are appropriate medications for treating low risk patients. They are also 20 appropriate alternatives for patients with a benzodiazepine contrain dication. Gabapentin may provide an 21 effective bridge therapy from alcohol withdrawal treatment to long -term alcohol use disorder 22 treatment.92,93 It has been fo und to improve rates of abstinence and reduce heavy drinking days compared 23 with placebo during the maintenance phase of alcohol use disorder treatment .62 24 25 Box 6. Gabapentin misuse, abuse, and diversion108 The FDA approved the use of gabapentin for the treatment of epilepsy and post -herpetic neuralgia. However, gabapentin has commonly been used off -label for the treatment of various other conditions, including alcohol use disorder or chronic pain. When the development process for this guideline began, gabapentin was largely perceived as safe and having limited potential for misuse or abuse a nd was not classified as a controlled substance in most of the country. However, with the increased use of gabapentin in the treatment of other conditions, some states have identified the potential risk for misuse, abuse, and diversion and have reclassifie d gabapentin as a Schedule -V medication. A systematic review examining gabapentin's misuse, abuse and diversion potential found evidence to support the risk associated with prescribing gabapentin. Although gabapentin was only misused by 1% of the general p opulation, 40 -65% of individuals prescribed gabapentin have misused or abused the medication. Similarly, patients with a substance use disorder were more likely to misuse gabapentin. Given this recent evidence, the recommendations made in this guideline pe rtaining to the risk of misuse, abuse , or diversion of gabapentin should be interpreted cautiously. 26 82 AMBULATORY MANAGEMENT Some patients benefit from the addition of an adjunct medication to control signs and symptoms of 1 withdrawal. Use of carbamazepine, gabapentin , or valproi c acid as an adjunct to benzodiazepines may be 2 appropriate. For patients in severe withdrawal, other medications can be used to manage signs and 3 symptoms if benzodiazepines are already being given.36 Before using an adjunct medication, clinicians 4 should ensure that an adequate dose of benzodiazepine has been administered since large doses of 5 benzodiazepine are sometimes needed to control withdrawal. 6 While valproic acid has been found to be promising for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal, more 7 evidence is needed before it can be recommended as monotherapy .62,109 Its use as an adjunct to 8 benzodiazepines is supported.2,13,44,58 However, valproic acid should not be used in patients with 9 hematological or hepatic disorders including acute liver impairment44 or in women of childbearing 10 potential because of teratogenic risk.110 11 (6) Phenobarbital 12 Recommendation IV. 37: Phenobarbital can be used for some patients in Level 2 -WM ambulatory 13 settings; however, it should only be used by clinicians experienced with its use given its narrow 14 therapeutic window and side effects. 15 Recommendation IV. 38: In a Level 2 -WM ambulatory setting, phenobarb ital monotherapy , managed by 16 a clinician experienced with its use, is an appropriate alternative to benzodiazepines for patients who are 17 experiencing severe alcohol withdrawal or who are at risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol 18 withdrawal or complication s of alcohol withdrawal . 19 Recommendation IV. 39: In a Level 2 -WM ambulatory setting, phenobarbital monotherapy , managed by 20 a clinician experienced with its use, is appropriate for patients with a contraindication for benzodiazepine 21 use who are experiencing moderate or severe alcohol withdrawal or who are at risk of developing severe 22 or complicated alcohol withdrawal or complication of alcohol withdrawal . 23 Discussion 24 There is disagreement in the literature regarding the appropr iateness of phenobarbital in ambulatory 25 settings, due to the risk of toxicity when used in combination with alcohol or in high doses.13,97,111 In 26 general, phenobarbital should only be used by clinicians experienced with its use in settings that offer 27 close monitoring. Phenobarbital may cause respiratory depression and over -sedation and its narrow 28 therape utic window makes it challenging to dose correctly compared to other medications used to treat 29 alcohol withdrawal. As with benzodiazepines, effects on the central nervous system are exacerbated when 30 other CNS depressants such as alcohol are also used. 31 Phenobarbital may be appropriate in Level 2 -WM ambulatory settings (e.g., ambulatory settings with 32 extended onsite monitoring) as an alternative to benzodiazepines when benzodiazepine use is 33 contraindicated. Phenobarbital is appropriate for such patients expe riencing moderate or severe 34 withdrawal or who are at risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal or complications of 35 alcohol withdrawal. Phenobarbital is also an appropriate benzodiazepine alternative outright for patients 36 experiencing or w ho are at risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal or complications 37 of alcohol withdrawal. 38 See Box 7 for more information on phenobarbital. 39 83 AMBULATORY MANAGEMENT (7) A2AAs and beta -blockers 1 Recommendation IV. 40: Alpha2 -adrenergic agonists (A2AAs) such as clonidine can be used as an 2 adjunct to benzodiazepine therapy to control autonomic hyperactivity and anxiety when symptoms are not 3 controlled by benzodiazepines alone. They should not be used alone to prevent or treat withdrawal -related 4 seizures or delirium. 5 Recommendation IV.4 1: Beta-adrenergic antagonists (beta -blockers) can be used as an adjunct to 6 benzodiazepines in select patients for control of persistent hypertension or tachycardia when these signs 7 are not controlled by benzodiazepines alone. They should not be used to prevent or treat alcohol 8 withdrawal seizures. 9 Discussion 10 No existing guidance or evidence was found regarding the use of alpha2 -adrenergic agonists (A2AAs) 11 and beta -adrenergic antagonists (beta -blockers) in ambulatory settings . 12 Many patients in alcohol withdrawal experience cardiac or adrenergic symptoms such as hypertension 13 and ta chycardia. These symptoms can be addressed by treating medical problems commonly seen in 14 patients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome, such as dehydration and electrolyte imbalances or through 15 use of benzodiazepines. A2AAs and beta -blockers can be used in con junction with benzodiazepines to 16 manage persistent hypertension or tachycardia .44,97 While these medications reduce the signs of 17 sympathetic activation, they do not treat the underlying pathophysiology, which may mask the 18 hyperadrenergic state and lead to a false perception that these signs are properly treated. They also do not 19 prevent withdrawal -related seizures or delirium and should not be used alone in th e treatment of alcohol 20 withdrawal . 21 See Box 8 for more information on A2AAs and beta -blockers . 22 (8) Inappropriate medications 23 Recommendation IV.4 2: Oral or int ravenous alcohol should not be used for the prevention or treatment 24 of alcohol withdrawal. 25 Recommendation IV.4 3: There is insufficient evidence to support the use of baclofen for the treatment 26 of alcohol withdrawal. 27 Recommendation IV.4 4: Providing magnesium as a prophylaxis or treatment for alcohol withdrawal 28 management has no supporting evidence . 29 Discussion 30 While ethyl alcohol administration has been used to manage withdrawal, it is not recommended.2,13,58 31 Administration of oral or intravenous alcohol has no proven efficacy, no accepted protocols , and known 32 toxicity.13 33 A recent Cochrane review of three RCTs on the use of baclofen for alcohol withdrawal treatment drew no 34 conclusions about efficacy or safety of baclofen due to insufficient and low quality evidence.112113 35 84 AMBULATORY MANAGEMENT ASAM's 2004 guideline, \"Management of Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium\", suggested that magnesium 1 may reduce neuromuscular activity in patients experiencing alcohol withdrawal delirium . However, a 2 recent Cochrane review114 concluded that t here is not enough evidence to determine the benefit of 3 magnesium in alcohol withdrawal prevention or management, which is in agreement with the ASAM's 4 1997 guideline on alcohol withdrawal management .13 5 85 INPATIENT MANAGEMENT V. Inpatient Management of Alcohol Withdrawal 1 This guideline divides recommendations on the management of alcohol withdrawal into two broad 2 categories where withdrawal management services are provided: ambulatory and inpatient settings. W hile 3 there are many differences in the services provided within these categories, and services should not 4 ideally be tied to a specific setting, this organization follows a reasonable structure that seems to match 5 how providers currently think about their practice context. The goal is that practitioners can reference one 6 management section or the other. There are many shared service practices across categories, however, 7 which creates a great deal of repetition across sections. This organization was intentio nal. As most readers 8 do not read through an entire guideline, the goal was to ensure that each section stands on its own. 9 The section applies to inpatient settings where withdrawal management is provided . This includ es two 10 Level 3 settings and one Level 4 setting as defined in The ASAM Criteria. These l evels of care are 11 primarily differentiated by the intensity of clinical services and medical training of staff. Level 3.2 -WM 12 clinically managed residential withdrawal management is a residential service providing 24 -hour structure 13 and support by trained, non -medical staff. They may have concurrent medical services equivalent to 14 primary care, but medical care is not provided 24/ 7. In some programs, staff supervise patients as they 15 self-administer medications. Level 3.7 -WM medically monitored inpatient withdrawal management is a 16 residential service providing 24 -hour structure and support by medical and nursing staff. They may be 17 located in a specialty addiction treatment or mental health setting with addiction treatment services. Level 18 4-WM medically managed intensive inpatient withdrawal management is a medical or psychiatric hospital 19 service with an addiction specialist physician (see The ASAM Criteria for additional details) . 20 This section is primarily informed by the extensive body of research conducted in hospital settings. 21 However, they should apply to all inpatient settin gs unless otherwise specified (e.g., treatment in 22 Intensive Care Unit [ICU] or Cardiac/Coronary Care Unit [CCU ]). Additional recommendations specific 23 to hospitalized patients or patients that are hospitalized primarily for a reason other than alcohol 24 withd rawal are included in the section VII. Specific Settings and Populations . 25 A. Monitoring 26 Recommendation V.1: The following monitori ng schedule is appropriate: 27 In patients with moderate to severe withdrawal or those requiring pharmacotherapy , re-assess 28 every 1 -4 hours for 24 hours, as clinically indicated . Once stabilized ( e.g., CIWA -Ar score < 10 29 for 24 hours), monitoring can be extended to every 4 -8 hours for 24 hours, as clinically indicated. 30 Patients with mild withdrawal and low risk of complicated withdrawal may be observed for up to 31 36 hours, after which more severe withdrawal is unlikely to develop. 32 Recommendation V.2: Monitor p atients' vital signs , hydration, orientation, sleep, and emotional status 33 including suicidal thoughts . 34 Recommendation V.3: Monitor patients receiving pharmacotherapy for alcohol withdrawal for signs of 35 over-sedation and respiratory depression. 36 Recommendation V.4: Signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal sh ould be monitored during 37 withdrawal management with a validated assessment scale (see Appendix III for a summary of scale s and 38 their associated features). 39 86 INPATIENT MANAGEMENT Discussion 1 Optimal monitoring frequency is a balance between clinical need and feasibility. Many sources, including 2 The ASAM Criteria , designate appropriate thresholds for frequency of monitoring. In a review of studies 3 comparing inpatient with outpatient alcohol wit hdrawal management, monitoring intervals ranged from 4 30 minutes to 8 hours .42,45 Monitoring of patients experiencing moderate and severe withdrawal or 5 patients experiencing mild withdrawal who are a t increased risk for developing severe, complicated , or 6 complications of withdrawal should initially be conducted every 1 -4 hours or as clinically indicated .7 7 Monitoring frequency can be reduced to every 4 -8 hours or as clinically indicated for stabilized patients, 8 usually defined as having controlled symptoms (e.g., CIWA -Ar score < 10) for 24 hours .45 9 Patients experiencing mild withdrawal who are at minimal risk for developing severe, complicated , or 10 complications of withdrawal can be observed for a shor ter duration of up to 36 hours, after which more 11 severe withdrawal is unlikely to develop .41 Optimal frequency of monitoring for patients in mild 12 withdrawal was not established by the Guideline Committe e, and they determined that frequency would 13 be driven more by the complicating factor(s) that led a patient in mild withdrawal to be treated in an 14 inpatient setting. 15 Signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal should be monitored using a validated withdrawal severity 16 scale .13,45 As discussed in section II.D: Symptom Assessment Scale s, various symptom assessment scale s 17 have been developed to addr ess circumstances such as a confounding illness or symptom self -reporting 18 barriers (see Appendix III for a summary of scale s and their associated features). Clinicians should ensure 19 that signs and symptoms are not worsening, that patients are responding as expected to medication if 20 provided, and that signs and symptoms are not persisting beyond the expected timeline of withdrawal. 21 Any of these indicate the need to reassess a patient's treatment plan and/or level of care . 22 Monitoring should consist of assessing a patient's vital signs , hydration, orientation, sleep, and emotional 23 status including suicidal thoughts .36,115 Fluid intake and output can be tracked in hospital settings, but they 24 can be monitored by patient report and observing for signs of dehydration in other inpatient se ttings .36 25 Orientation, sleep quality and emotional status including suicidality should be monitored. Orientation and 26 anxiety are included in many withdrawal severity scales. Poor orient ation can also indicate over -sedation 27 from prescribed withdrawal medication. Patients receiving pharmacotherapy for alcohol withdrawal 28 should be monitored for other signs of over -sedation and respiratory depression including ataxia, 29 confusion, memory impai rment, and delirium. 30 B. Supportive Care 31 Recommendation V.5: Supportive care is a critical component of alcohol withdrawal management. 32 Frequent reassurance, re -orientation to time and place, and nursing care are recommended non - 33 pharmacological interventions. Providers should ensure patients are educated about what to expect over 34 the course of withdrawal, including common signs and symptom s and how they will be treated. Patients 35 with severe alcohol withdrawal should be cared for in an evenly lit, quiet room. Patients should be offered 36 hope and the expectation of recovery . 37 Recommendation V.6: Supportive care for alcohol withdrawal patients includes adherence to safety 38 measures and protocol s (e.g., assess risk for fall/syncope). If available and applicable , existing 39 institutional/hospital -associated delirium protocols can be used for supportive care of pa tients with severe 40 alcohol withdrawal. 41 87 INPATIENT MANAGEMENT Recommendation V.7: Thiamine should be provided to prevent Wernicke encephalopathy. 1 Intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) administration of thiamine is preferred, in particular for 2 patients with poor nutritional status, malabsorption, or who are known to have severe 3 complications of alcohol withdrawal. 4 Typical dosing is 100 mg IV/IM per day for 3 -5 days. Oral thiamine also c an also be offered . 5 Patients also receiving glucose can be administered thiamine and glucose in any order or 6 concurrently. 7 Recommendation V.8: Clinicians should administer thiamine to patients admitted to the ICU to treat 8 alcohol withdrawal. 9 Recommendation V.9: For patients with hypomagnesemia, cardiac arrhythmias, electrolyte disturbances, 10 or a previous history of alcohol withdrawal seizures, magnesium should be administered. 11 Recommendation V.10: If phosphorus is <1 mg/dL, supplementation should be provide d. Otherwise, in 12 the case of moderate hypophosphatemia (1 -2 mg/dL), correction through proper nutrition is 13 recommended. 14 Recommendation V.11: In patients who are critically ill, folate supplementation may be considered, 15 since chronic alcohol use is associat ed with hyperhomocysteinemia. 16 Discussion 17 Supportive non -pharmacologic care is a critical component of alcohol withdrawal management. While 18 empirical research on many of the components of supportive care is not available , existing reviews and 19 guidelines support interventions such as informing patients of what to expect over the course of treatment 20 and providing frequent reassurance,4 reality orientati on, and general nursing care during 21 treatment.2,7,36,70,115 Also emphasized was provid ing care in a quiet, evenly -lit room .2,7,14,36,70,116 22 Non-pharmacological s upportive care also includes following standard care protoco ls and safety 23 protocols. Safety measures such as fall precautions and routine nurse check -ins and assistance with 24 activities of daily living (ADLs) ensures patient safety and provides autonomy. For facilities with a 25 hospital -associated delirium protocol, clinicians should implement the protocol to prevent and reduce the 26 incidence and duration of acute delirium among patients wit h severe alcohol withdrawal. Studies have 27 shown standardized protocols to be effective at reducing the incidence, duration, and frequency of 28 delirium among hospitalized pa tients .117 29 Determining risk for Wernicke encephalopathy not standardized. For example, the NICE guideline 30 recommends parenteral administration of th iamine to any hospitalized patient who is a harmful or 31 dependent drinker.21 At least one Wernicke encephalopathy risk assessment scale for patients 32 withdrawing from alcohol has been developed .118 The presence of risk factors for Wernicke 33 encephalopathy (malnutrition or poor diet, weight loss, vomiting, confusion, or other neurological 34 symptoms) is scored depending on severity and results indicate whether enteral or parenteral thiamine 35 should be adm inistered. 36 Previous guidelines , including the previous ASAM alcohol withdrawal management guideline , have 37 recommended that IV thiamine be given prior to intravenous glucose .14,36,44,115 The reasoning was that 38 thiamine is necessary for carbohydrate metabolism and thiamine deficiency can lead to decreased 39 absorption of glucose, perhaps precipitating acute Wernicke encephalopathy . However, there is a lack of 40 clinical evidence to support this theory and it is important that glucose delivery not be delayed in patients 41 88 INPATIENT MANAGEMENT who are nutritionally compromised. The Guideline Committee concluded that it is not necessary to 1 administer thiamine prior to glucose, that these could be provided in any order or concurrently in order to 2 not delay treatment . 3 Other common deficiencies seen in patients with alcohol withdrawal include low folate, magnesium, 4 phosphorous and potassium. While early work recommended an aggressive approach to correcting 5 nutritional deficiencies, more recent thinking is that levels self -correct rapidly with improved diet. The 6 Guideline Committee supported a conservative stance of selectively correcting hypoma gnesemia , 7 hypokalemia, and acute severe hypophosphatemia (serum phosphate < 1 mg/dL) when they are detected 8 through laboratory testing.115 Magnesium can also be routinely supplemented in patients with cardiac 9 arrhythmias or a previous history of alcohol withdrawal seizures .7 Folate supplementation with 1 mg daily 10 can also be considered for patients who are critically ill because folate is not included in the 11 recommended routine laboratory tests and chronic alcohol use is associated with hyperhomocysteinemia 12 result ing from folate deficiency.26,45,115 13 C. AUD Treatment Initiation and Engagement 14 Recommendation V .12: The period of alcohol withdrawal management should be used to engage 15 patients with an alcohol use disorder (AUD) with comprehensive treatment . When feasible, AUD 16 treatment should be initiated concurrently with alcohol withdrawal management as cognitive status 17 permits. If appropriate, clinicians should also offer to initiate pharmacotherapy for AUD as cognitive 18 status permits. Clinicians should explain the range of evidence -based treatment services available at the 19 current site and in the community. Finally, c linicians should proactively connect patients to treatment 20 services as seamlessly as possible, including initiating a war m handoff to treatment providers . 21 Discussion 22 One important function of supportive care is to connect with patients to help facilitate continuing 23 treatment.2 24 It is widely recognized that alcohol withdrawal management al one is not a treatment for alcohol use 25 disorder (AUD) . The need for alcohol withdrawal management services almost universally signifies the 26 presence of an alcohol use disorder and need for treatment. The Guideline Committee agreed that it 27 should be explici tly communicated to alcohol withdrawal patient s if they have an alcohol use disorder and 28 engaged with treatment for that disorder. 29 Several leading clinical guidelines conclude that the success of an alcohol withdrawal management 30 episode is defined not onl y by the acute management of withdrawal signs and symptoms, but by the 31 engagement in continued treatment for alcohol use disorder by patient s.4,12,80 Whenever possible, AUD 32 treatment should be initiated concurrent with a lcohol withdrawal management as cognitive status 33 permits.12 At a minimum, c linicians should proactively connect patients to AUD treatment services and 34 transition patients as seamlessly as possible through a warm handoff to treatment providers . 35 Despite the clear and frequently stated importance of the transition between withdrawal management and 36 long-term AUD treatment, research on optimal strategies is extremely sparse. More recently, studies are 37 including follow -up meas ures such as entry into AUD treatment following withdrawal completion, but 38 this is rarely a primary outcome of interest. One RCT conducted in the United States119 found that 39 participants who received three Motivational Interviewing sessions during inpatient withdrawal treatment 40 89 INPATIENT MANAGEMENT were more likely to attend self -help groups two months after discharge compared to control participants, 1 but were not more likely to be abs tinent or engage in formal AUD treatment. 2 Another method of improving AUD treatment initiation may result from changes in health care system 3 integrations and payment structures. Successfully t ransitioning patients from alcohol withdrawal 4 management to alcohol use disorder treatment will result in fewer repeat alcohol withdrawal management 5 episodes, and therefore better outcomes and lower cost. Initiating AUD treatment after alcohol 6 withdrawal can be used as a performance measure or integrated into reimbursement contracts as \"to not 7 include facilita tion of treatment entry would be considered inadequate and incomplete treatment.\"4 (p7) 8 Levels of care that are part of \"Integrated systems of care which are accountable (nancially and 9 otherwise) for health outcomes will be highly motivated to use the withdrawal management encounter as 10 an opportunity to identify cases of addiction that need to be treated and otherwise may have escaped 11 identication.\"12 (p129 12 D. Pharmacotherapy 13 (1) Prophylaxis 14 Recommendation V.13: For patients at risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal or 15 complications of alcohol withdrawal , preventative pharmacotherapy should be provided. Benzodiazepines 16 are first -line treatment because of their well -documented effectiveness in reducing the signs and 17 symptoms of withdrawal including the incidence of s eizure and delirium . For patients with a 18 contraindication for benzodiazepine use, phenobarbital can be used by providers experienced with its use . 19 In settings with close monitoring, phenobarbital adjunct to benzodiazepines is also appropriate. 20 Recommendation V.14: A front loading regimen is recommended for patients at high risk of severe 21 withdrawal syndro me. Providing at least a single dose of preventative medication is appropriate for 22 patients at lower levels of risk who have: 23 A history of severe or complicated withdrawal 24 An acute medical, psychiatric , or surgical illness 25 Severe coronary artery disease 26 Displaying signs or symptoms of withdrawal concurrent with a positive blood alcohol content 27 Discussion 28 Determining risk of developing severe or complicated withdrawal or complications of withdrawal is 29 addressed in section II: Initial Assessment of Alcohol Withdrawal . Patients at risk of developing severe or 30 complicated alcohol withdrawal or complications from alcohol withdrawal should receive 31 pharmacotherapy as soon as possible to prevent these signs and symptoms .4,13,89 Benzodiazepines are 32 recommended as the primary medication to prevent the development of severe, complicated , or 33 complications of withdrawal. T here is clear evidence that benzodiazepines reduce the incidence of alcohol 34 withdrawal seizures and alcohol withdr awal delirium. Phenobarbital can be used for patients with a 35 contraindication for benzodiazepine use. However, given its narrow therapeutic window , it should only be 36 used by clinicians experienced with its use . 37 For patients at high risk of severe withdrawal, front loading with a benzodiazepine is recommended to 38 rapidly achieve therapeutic levels of medication. Front loading has been shown to reduce the duration of 39 90 INPATIENT MANAGEMENT treatment . incidence of withdrawal seizure , and dur ation of delirium.2,13,102 Patients should be closely 1 observed for over -sedation and respiratory depression following the administration of a loading dose. 2 For patients at lower levels of risk, providing at least a single or a few doses of benzodiazepine is 3 appropriate and can be followed by a medication chosen according to symptom severity (see V.D(2) : 4 Withdrawal symptoms ).2,4 If a clinician determines that a patient is no longer at risk, for example, because 5 risk is sufficiently mitigated by administration of medication or because the course of withdrawal has 6 passed the period of acute risk, ongoing pharmacotherapy for alcohol withdrawal can be determined 7 according to the severity of a patient's withdrawal at that time. Some situations which have been called 8 out as appropriate for administer ing at least a single dose of benzodiazepines include : a history of severe 9 or co mplicated withdrawal ; risk for complications of significant medical, surgical , or psychiatric illness 10 (particularly cardiovascular disease including coronary artery disease );4 and displaying signs or symptoms 11 of withdrawal concurrent with a positive blood alcohol content (an indication of risk for developing 12 severe withdrawal syndrome ). 13 (2) Withdrawal symptoms 14 Recommendation V.15: For patients experiencing mild alcohol withdrawal (e.g., CIWA -Ar score <10) 15 who are at minimal risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal or complications of 16 alcohol withdrawal , pharmacotherapy or supportive care alone ma y be provided. If providing medication, 17 benzodiazepines, carbamazepine , or gabapentin are appropriate. For patients with contraindication for 18 benzodiazepine use, carbamazepine, gabapentin, or phenobarbital (for providers experienced with its use), 19 are ap propriate. Carbamazepine, gabapentin , or valproic acid ( if no liver disease or childbearing potential) 20 may be used as an adjunct to benzodiazepines. 21 Recommendation V.16: Patients experiencing moderate alcohol withdrawal (e.g., CIWA -Ar scores 10 - 22 18) should receive pharmacotherapy Benzodiazepines are first-line treatment . Carbamazepine or 23 are appropriate alternatives . For patients with a contraindication for benzodiazepine use, 24 carbamazepine, gabapentin , or phenobarbital (for provider s experienced with its use) are appropriate . 25 Carbamazepine, gabapentin , or valproic acid (if no liver disease or childbeari ng potential) may be used as 26 an adjunct to benzodiazepines. 27 Recommendation V.17: Patients experiencing severe alcohol withdrawal (e.g., CIWA -Ar scores 19) 28 should receive pharmacotherapy . Benzodiazepines are first -line treatment. For patients with a 29 contraindication for benzodiazepine use, phenobarbital is appropriate for provider is experien ced with its 30 use. If close monitoring is available, phenobarbital can be used as an adjunct to benzodiazepine s. Other 31 adjunct medications can be considered after a clinician ensures that an adequate dose of benzodiazepines 32 has been administered. 33 Recommendation V.18: If a patient's symptoms are not controlled as expected : 34 First consider increasing the dose 35 If over -sedation or inadequate monitoring is a concern: 36 Reassess for appropriate level of care 37 Consider switching medication 38 If using benzodiazepines, c onsider adding an adjunct medication 39 91 INPATIENT MANAGEMENT Discussion 1 For patients experiencing mild alcohol withdrawal (e.g., CIWA -Ar score <10) who are at minimal risk of 2 developing severe, complicated , or complications of alcohol withdrawal, the decision to provide 3 medication to alleviate symptoms of withdrawal is at the discretion of clinician s. Previous g uidelines and 4 reviews have indicated that patients experiencing mild alcohol withdrawal (e.g., CIWA -Ar score <10) 5 who are at minimal risk of worsening symptoms can be safely treated with monitored supportive care 6 alone .13,51 Early evidence for the safety of non-pharmacological treatment of alcohol withdrawal draws 7 from studies of \"social detoxification\" settings .120-122 Research has demonstrated that patients who never 8 reach a CIWA -Ar score 10 and thus do not receive medication in accordance with a symptom -triggered 9 protocol are not at higher risk of adverse events than patients who receive d medication through a fixed - 10 dose protocol . In addition, patients receiving medications through a symptom triggered protocol require 11 less medicat ion overall and experienc e a shorter duration of treatment .123-126 Others have argued that any 12 withdrawal signs and symptoms are harmful to patient health4 and that untreated withdrawal contribute s 13 to the kindling process, where by repeated episod es of alcohol withdrawal syndrome become 14 progressively severe through increased neuronal excitability and sensitivity .7 Patients experiencing 15 moderate or severe withdrawal (e.g., CIWA -Ar scores 10) should receive pharmacotherapy . Moderate 16 to severe withdrawal at treatment baseline has been identified as a risk factor for developing more severe 17 withdrawal during the course of treatment.54 18 Carbamazepine and gabapentin are appropriate for managing mild and moderate alcohol withdrawal in 19 patients who are at minimal risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal.92-94 As 20 symptom severity or risk of developing severe sy mptoms increases, medications with well -established 21 effectiveness in preventing the incidence of severe and complicated withdrawal are preferred.54 22 Benzodiazepines a re first -line agents for treating moderate58,65,81 and severe alcohol withdrawal13,58 due to 23 their known effectiveness in preventing seizures and delirium.13,90,94 Benzodiazepines are also appropriate 24 for patients experiencing mild wit hdrawal in inpatient settings due to the reduced risks associated with 25 use in settings with more intensive monitoring. Carbamazepine, gabapentin , or phenobarbital can be used 26 for patients experiencing mild or moderate withdrawal who have a contraindication for benzodiazepine 27 use.58,65,81,92 Phenobarbital is the preferred alternative for patients experiencing severe withdrawal. 28 However, g iven its narrow therapeutic window , phe nobarbital should only be used by clinicians 29 experienced with its use. 30 Patients receiving pharmacotherapy should be monitored for signs of response to medication. If the 31 patient do es not respond as expected, a number of actions can be considered. First, co nsider increasing the 32 dose. The amount of medication required to control symptoms is variable and ultimately determined by 33 clinical judgment. Patients with more severe withdrawal may require larger doses than are typically seen 34 in other patient populations , particularly during early withdrawal (see Appendix V for typical doses). 35 Providing large doses of benzodiazepine can lead to over -sedation and respiratory depression and patients 36 should be monitored closely. 37 Second, patients should be reassessed for appropriate level of care . Failure to respond may reflect the 38 presence of more severe withdrawal th an expected and significant risk of major complications .13 A more 39 intensive level of care may be needed to monitor and manage major complications if they occur.82 40 Third, consider switching t o a different medication. Failure to respond to benzodiazepine may reflect 41 benzodiazepine resistance due to kindling (see section VI.D : Resistant Alcohol Withdrawal ). A greater 42 number of previous alcohol withdrawal episodes can be associated with decreased responsiveness to 43 92 INPATIENT MANAGEMENT benzodiazepines.4 Failure to respond may also be due to withdrawal from another GABAergic agent . In 1 these cases, switching to an alternative medication should be considered. 2 Fourth, if using benzodiazepines, consider adding an adjunct medication. Some patients benefit from the 3 addition of an adjunct medication to control signs and symptoms of withdrawal and their use can be 4 considered as part of the treatment plan . The use of carbamazepine, gabapentin , or valproic acid as an 5 adjunct medication may be appropriate for patients experiencing moderate or severe withdrawal. Valproic 6 acid should not be used in patients who have acute liver impairment or women of childbearing potential 7 (see V.D(5) Carbamazepine, gabapentin, valproic acid ). Adjunct phenobarbital can be used in patients 8 with severe withdrawal in settings with close monitoring. Phenobarbital and be nzodiazepines act on the 9 same receptors, which leads to additive clinical effects in controlling alcohol withdrawal syndromes ( see -adren ergic antagonist can be used in conjunction with 11 benzodiazepines to manage persistent hypertension or tachycardia (see V.D(7) A2AAs and beta- 12 blockers ).44,97 13 (3) 14 Recommendation V.19: While no particular benzodiazepine agent is more effective than another, l onger- 15 acting benzodiazepines are the preferred agent s due to clinical benefits of their longer duration of action . 16 Recommendation V.20: If waiting for lab test(s) results or if the t est(s) are unavailable, if a patient has 17 signs of significant liver disease , use a benzodiazepine with less hepatic metabolization. 18 Recommendation V.21: Clinicians should monitor patients taking benzodiazepines for signs of over- 19 sedation and respiratory . 20 Recommendation V.22: A benzodiazepine prescri ption to treat alcohol withdrawal should be 21 discontinued following treatment . 22 Discussion 23 Benzodiazepines are commonly recommended as first -line agents for managing most forms of alcohol 24 withdrawal.13,94 Diazepam, lorazepam and chlordiazepoxide are the most frequently used in t reating 25 alcohol withdrawal. While there is no evidence showing superiority of effectiveness among 26 benzodiazepine agents,13,90 longer -acting agents are pr eferred by many clinicians.2,51,81 A long duration of 27 action contributes to a smoother course of withdrawal and greater control of breakthrough and rebound 28 signs or symptoms. This provides greater coverage for preventing alcohol withdrawal seizures and 29 delirium.90 For this reason, patients prescribed a shorter -acting agent should have a more gradual taper 30 and be reassessed more frequently (see V.D(4) : Benzodiazepine dosing regimens ).98 31 Longer -acting agents can accumulate and lead to over-sedation and respiratory depression , particularly in 32 older patients or those with compromised health. Other signs of accumulation include ataxia, confusion, 33 memory impairment, and delirium, which may be diffic ult to differentiate from alcohol withdrawal - 34 related delirium.2 Benzodiazepine associated delirium has been diagnosed by the administration of 35 flumazenil, a GABA -A receptor antagonist, but this protocol was not reviewed by the Guideline 36 Committee.99 A reduction in the benzodiazepine dose and the addition of a neuroleptic agent to control for 37 agitation and/or confusion can be considered if patients are not at an elevated risk of seizure (i.e., they are 38 outside of the acute risk window).2 Some neuroleptic agents have been shown to reduce the seizure 39 threshold. 40 93 INPATIENT MANAGEMENT Benzodiazepine accumulation is more likely in patients with impaired hepatic function. Medication dose 1 can be reduced or a benzodiazepine with less dependence on hepatic metabolism can be used (see VII.D : 2 Patients with Medical C onditions ). The l aboratory test s recommended in section II.E: Identify Concurrent 3 Conditions can indicate the need to adjust the treatment plan . However, as treatment should not be 4 delayed while waiting for lab test (s) results or if the test(s) are unavailable at the treatment setting, it is 5 appropriate to initially reduce the dose or use a benzodiazepine with less hepatic metabolization if a 6 patient has sig ns of significant liver disease . 7 Signs of significant liver disease include: 8 Skin and eyes that appear yellowish (jaundice) 9 Swelling in the legs and ankles (edema) 10 Itchy skin 11 Dark urine color 12 Pale stool color, or bloody or tar -colored stool 13 Confusion 14 Chronic fatigue 15 Nausea or vomiting 16 (4) Benzodiazepine dosing regimens 17 Recommendation V.23: Symptom -triggered treatment is the preferred benzodiazepine dosing method. 18 Fixed dosing according to a scheduled taper is appropriate if symptom -triggered treatment cannot be 19 used. 20 Recommendation V.24: Front loading is recommended for patients experiencing severe alcohol 21 withdr awal (e.g., CIWA -Ar scores 19). Diazepam or chlordiazepoxide are preferred agents for front 22 loading . 23 Recommendation V.25: When using a fixed -dose schedule, patients' signs and symptoms should still be 24 monitored, and additional doses of medication provided as needed. 25 Recommendation V.26: If prescribing a shorter -acting benzodiazepine, using a fixed -dose regimen wi th 26 a gradual taper may be appropriate to reduce the likelihood of breakthrough and rebound signs and 27 symptoms. 28 Discussion 29 Examples for these dosing regimens can be found in Appendix V . 30 Multiple dosing strategies have been used to administer benzodiazepine s during alcohol withdrawal. In 31 general, symptom -triggered treatment is the prefe rred dosing method. In this regimen, medication is 32 administered only when patients are experiencing significant withdrawal symptoms according to a 33 severity scale. This allows dosing to be individualized according to symptom severity and reduces the risk 34 of under - and over -treating by assessi ng and dosing according to real -time symptom severity. Very large 35 doses of medication may be needed rapidly, and reduced as symptoms resolve.2,13 Symptom -triggered 36 dosing has been shown to reduce the duration of treatment and inpatient length of stay compared to a 37 fixed -dose schedule.2,21,44,51 38 94 INPATIENT MANAGEMENT Fixed dosing is appropriate when it is not practical t o obtain a symptom severity score to conduct 1 symptom -triggered treatment . In a fixed -dose regimen , set amounts of medication are administered at 2 regular intervals, and the dose amount, dosing frequency , or both are gradually tapered according to a set 3 schedule. While fixed dosing is easy to administer, over- or underestimat ing the amount of 4 benzodiazepine needed may lead to insufficient symptom control or over-sedation.26 Additional doses58 5 and dose adjustment should be provided as needed .7,42 6 Front loading is preferred for patients at risk for or experiencing severe alcohol withdrawal (e.g., CIWA - 7 Ar scores 19). Front loading describes when a moderate to high dose of a long -acting benzodiazepine is 8 administered to achieve rapid control of withdrawal signs and symptoms and is allowed to taper through 9 metabolism. Diazepam and chlordiazepoxide are the preferred agents for front lo ading. This regimen is 10 typically used when rapid administration of a benzodiazepine is required, either because patients are 11 experiencing significant symptoms or are at risk of developing them. Front loading has been shown to 12 reduce the duration of treatme nt and incidence of withdrawal seizure and duration of delirium.102 This 13 effect is usually attributed to the rapid administration of large amounts of benzodiazepines early in the 14 withdrawal period.2,13 A front loading regimen can be driven by a withdrawal symptom severity scale 15 (e.g., 10 mg diazepam PO every hour if CIWA -Ar score 10) or according to a fixed schedule (e.g., 20 16 mg diazepam PO every 2 hours for 3 doses). Symptom -triggered front loading has been shown to reduce 17 symptom duration and the amount of benzodiazepine used ,70,103 -106 the incidence of withdrawal seizures , 18 and the duration of delirium for patients being treated in the ICU.102 Fixed -dose front loading can be used 19 in patients for whom it would be difficult to obtain an accurate score on a withdrawal severity scale . 20 While monitoring for signs of over-sedatio n and respiratory depression is important for any dosing 21 regimen,49 it is particularly important for patients on fixed -dose and front -loading regimens. Patients 22 receiving fixed doses can become over -sedated if the wrong schedule is chosen and front -loading doses 23 are rapidly administered .7,42 24 Because of their shorter duration of action, short -acting benzodiazepine concentrations can diminish 25 rapidly, increasing the chance for rebound and breakthrough symptoms and signs including seizure. For 26 this reason, a fixed -dose schedule with a long taper may be more feasible than a symptom -triggered 27 dosing regimen requiring very frequent reassessment. Shorter -acting benzodiazepines should be tapered 28 carefully even after withdrawal resolves to prevent the development of rebound or breakthrough signs and 29 symptoms. If the CIWA -Ar is used in conju nction with short acting benzodiazepines, the assessments 30 should be done promptly in order to prevent seizures due to protocol errors.98 31 (5) Carbamazepine, gabapentin, valproic acid 32 Recommendation V.27: Gabapentin is a favorable choice for treating alcohol withdrawal when a 33 clinician also plans to use it for a patient's ongoing treatment of alcohol use disorder. 34 Recommendation V.28: If benzodiazepines are contraindicated, carbamazepine or gabapentin are 35 appropriate alternatives for patients in mild or moderate withdrawal . 36 Recommendation V.29: Carbamazepine, gabapentin , or valproic acid may be used as an adjunct to 37 benzodiazepine therapy to help control alcohol withdr awal. Before using as an adjunct, clinicians should 38 ensure that an adequate dose of benzodiazepine has been administered. 39 Recommendation V.30: Valproic acid should not be used in patients who have liver disease or women of 40 childbearing potential. 41 95 INPATIENT MANAGEMENT Recommendation V.31: There is insufficient evidence to support the use of valproic acid as 1 monotherapy for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal. 2 Discussion 3 Evidence suggests that anticonvulsants, particularly carbamazepine, are effective at preventing alcohol 4 withdrawal progression, seizures and delirium.4 At this time, there is insufficient evidence to support their 5 use over benzodiazepi nes for patients at increased risk of severe withdrawal, seizures , or 6 delirium.2,13,38,92,107 As the efficacy of benzodiazepines is well -established, there have been ethical 7 concerns with running placebo -controlled or treatment -as-usual -controlled (i.e., compared to 8 benzodiazepines) studies in at -risk populations.2,92 9 Carbamazepine or gabapentin are appropriate medications for treating low risk patients. They are also 10 appropriate alternatives for patients with a benzodiazepine contraindication. Gabapentin may provide an 11 effective bridge therapy from alcohol withdrawal treatment to long -term alcohol use disorder 12 treatment.92,93 It has been found to improve rates of abstinence and reduce heavy drinking days compared 13 with placebo during the maintenance phase of alcohol use disorder treatment .62 14 Some patie nts benefit from the addition of an adjunct medication to control signs and symptoms of 15 withdrawal. Use of carbamazepine, gabapentin , or valproic acid as an adjunct to benzodiazepines is an 16 appropriate therapy for patients experiencing mild or moderate withdrawal. For patients in severe 17 withdrawal, other medications can be used to manage signs and symptoms if benzodiazepines have 18 already being given.36 Before using as an adjunct medicati on, clinicians should ensure that an adequate 19 dose of benzodiazepine has been administered since large doses of benzodiazepine are sometimes needed 20 to control withdrawal. 21 While valproic acid has been found to be promising for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal, more 22 evidence is needed before it can be recommended as monotherapy .62,109 Its use as an adjunct to 23 benzodiazepines is supported.2,13,44,58 However, valproic acid should not be used in patients with 24 hematological or hepatic disorders including acute liver impairment44 or in women of childbearing 25 potential because of teratogenic risk.110 26 (6) Phenobarbital 27 Recommendation V.32: Phenobarbital can be used for some patients in inpatient settings; however, it 28 should only be used by clinicians experienced with its use given its narrow therapeutic window and side 29 effects. 30 Recommendation V.33: In an inpatient setting, phenobarbital monotherapy (managed by a clinician 31 experienced with its use) is appropriate for patients with a contraindication for benzodiazepine use who 32 are experiencing mild, moderate, or severe withdrawal or who are at risk of developing severe or 33 complicated alcohol withdrawal or complication s of alcohol withdrawal . 34 Recommendation V.34: In an inpatient setting, if close monitoring is available, phenobarbital (managed 35 by a clinician experienced with its use) as an adjunct to benzodiazepines is an option for patients 36 experiencing severe withdrawal or who are at risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol 37 withdrawal or complications of alcohol withdrawal . 38 96 INPATIENT MANAGEMENT Recommendation V.35: Parenteral phenobarbital should only be used in highly supervised settings (e.g., 1 ICU, CCU) because of risk of over -sedation and respiratory depression. 2 Discussion 3 In general, phenobarbital should only be used by clinicians experienced with its use and should be used 4 cautiously in settin gs that offer less monitoring. Phenobarbital may cause respiratory depression and over - 5 sedation and its narrow therapeutic window makes it challenging to dose correctly compared to other 6 medications used to treat alcohol withdrawal. Phenobarbital is more commonly used in an inpatient 7 setting that is highly supervised such as the ICU or the Emergency Department ( ED) for these reasons. 8 A primary indication for phenobarbital use is as an alternative to benzodiazepines when benzodiazepine 9 use is contraindicated. This is appropriate for patients experiencing mild, moderate , or severe withdrawal 10 or who are at risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal or complications of alcohol 11 withdrawal. 12 Phenobarbital is also an effective adjunct to benzodiazepines and, if close monitoring is available, can be 13 used for patients experiencing severe withdrawal or who are at risk of developing severe or complicated 14 alcohol withdrawal or complications of alc ohol withdrawal. Providing a single dose of IV phenobarbital 15 10 mg/kg in 100 mL normal saline infused over 30 minutes in addition to loraz epam in ED was shown to 16 reduce the rate of ICU admissions without increasing the incidence of adverse events .127 This strategy 17 requires close monitoring in highly supervised settings as parenteral administration of phenobarbital is 18 associated with increased overdose risk. 19 20 Box 7: History of phenobarbital use in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal128-130 Phenobarbital is the first medication to be used successfully to treat alcohol withdrawal in a predictable way. It has been used for this purpose since the 1920's after first being introduced in 1912 for the treatment of seizures. It exerts its effects on the GABAA receptor by increasing the duration of channel opening when bound to GABA, which increases the hyperpolarization of the neuron, thus indirectly increasing the sedative effects of the \"GABA system.\" It also has direct blockade effects on excitator y glutamate signaling. Given these two mechanisms, it seems to be a perfect fit for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal, which creates an imbalance in these two systems. And, in experienced hands, it can be very effective. However, phenobarbital has a numb er of side effects including bradycardia, bradypnea, hypothermia, hypotension, pulmonary edema, acute renal failure and Steven -Johnson syndrome. It has a half -life of up to seven days, is primarily metabolized by the liver and induces many isoenzymes of the P450 system. This coupled with a relatively narrow therapeutic window , caused it to fall out of favor in the 1960's as chlordiazepoxide and oxazepam were shown to be as effective, but harbor a much lower risk. N ow we have solid data that supports the use of GABA sensitive antiepileptiform medications that are as effective, require less training, and have a much lower side effect profile than phenobarbital or benzodiazepines. While, there is a current reemergence of interest in phenobarbital as a standalone therapy for alcohol withdrawal, these guidelines have taken into account history and comparative safety when developing the evidence -based recommendations for its use in the population as a whole. 21 97 INPATIENT MANAGEMENT (7) A2AAs and beta-blockers 1 such as clonidine and dexmedetomidine 2 can be used as an adjunct to benzodiazepine therapy to control autonomic hyperactivity and anxiety when 3 these signs are not controlled by benzodiazepines alone. They should not be used alone to prevent or treat 4 withdrawal -related seizures or delirium. 5 Recommendation V.37: Beta-adrenergic antagonists (beta -blockers) can be used as an adjunct to 6 benzodiazepines in select patients for control of persistent hypertension or tachycardia when these signs 7 are not controlled by benzodiazepines alone. They should not be used to prevent or treat alcohol 8 withdrawal seizures. 9 Discussion 10 Many patients in alcohol withdrawal experience cardiac or adrenergic signs such as hypertension and 11 tachycardia.45 These signs can be addressed by treating medical problems commonly seen in patients with 12 alcohol withdrawal syndrome, such as dehydration and electrolyte imbalance s or through the use of 13 benzodiazepines. -adrenergic agonists (A2AAs) and beta -adrenergic antagonist 14 can be used in conjunction with benzodiazepines to manage persistent hypertension or tachycardia.44,97 15 While these medications reduce the signs of sympathetic activation, they do not treat the underlying 16 pathophysiology, which may mask the hyperadrenergic state and lead to a false perception that these signs 17 are properly treated. They also d o not prevent withdra wal-related seizures or deliriu m and should not be 18 used alone in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal. 19 20 Box 8. Alpha2 -adrenergic (beta -blockers) can be used in conjunction with benzodiazepines to manage persistent hypertension or tachycardia. A2AAs bind to receptors inhibiting the release of norepinephrine from the presynaptic neuron. The release of norepinephrine would cause an increase in activit y of the sympathetic pathway leading to increased heart rate and blood pressure. Therefore, A2AAs reduce cardiac output and reduce tachycardia and hypertension. Beta-blockers have a different mechanism of action. Normally norepinephrine released from sympa thetic nerves binds to beta -adrenoceptors resulting in activation of the sympathetic pathway causing an increase in heart rate and blood pressure. However, beta -blockers compete with norepinephrine and epinephrine for the same binding site. Thus norepineph rine is unable to bind to the site, which reduces the signs of sympathetic activity including heart rate and blood pressure. Unlike A2AAs , beta-blockers do not reduce sympathetic activity but rather mask symptoms associated with sympathetic activation such as tachycardia and hypertension. These medications do not treat the underlying pathophysiology, but reduce signs, which may mask the hyperadrenergic state and lead to a false perception that these signs are properly treated. Although not explicitly rated by the Guideline Committee, persistent hypertension or tachycardia may be reasons to transfer patients to an inpatient setting. 21 98 INPATIENT MANAGEMENT (8) Inappropriate medications 1 Recommendation V.38: Oral or intravenous alcohol should not be used for the prevention or treatment 2 of alcohol withdrawal. 3 Recommendation V.39: There is insufficient evidence to support the use of baclofen for the treatment of 4 alcohol withdrawal. 5 Recommendation V.40: Providing magnesium as a prophylaxis or treatment for alcohol withdrawal 6 management has no supporting evidence. 7 Discussion 8 While ethyl alcohol administration has been used to manage withdrawal, it is not recommended.2,13,58 9 Administration of oral or intravenous alcohol has no proven efficacy, no accepted protocols and known 10 toxicity.13 11 A recent Cochrane review of three RCTs on the use of baclofen for alcohol withdrawal treatment drew no 12 conclusions about efficacy or safety of baclofen due to insufficient and low quality evidence.112 13 ASAM 's 2004 guideline , \"Management of Alcohol Withdrawal D elirium ,\" suggested that magnesium 14 may reduce neuromuscular activity in patients experiencing alcohol withdrawal . However, a recent 15 Cochrane review114 concluded that there is not enough evidence to det ermine the benefit of magnesium in 16 alcohol withdrawal prevention or management , which is in agreement with the ASAM 's 1997 guideline.13 17 99 ADDRESSING COMPLICATIONS VI. Addressing Complicated Alcohol Withdrawal 1 In this section, we highlight special considerations for patients with or at risk for alcohol withdrawal 2 seizure or alcohol withdrawal delirium, alcohol -induced psychotic disorder , or resistant alcohol 3 withdrawal . Aspects of management that might need to be adjusted for these patients, including 4 monitoring, supportive care, and pharmaco therapy are discussed. Guidelines pertaining to assessment and 5 overall management can be fou nd in the relevant sections above. 6 A. Alcohol Withdrawal Seizure 7 (1) Monitoring 8 Recommendation VI.1: Patients should be monitored for alcohol withdrawal seizures even in the 9 absence of other clinically prominent alcohol withdrawal signs or symptoms. 10 Recommendation VI.2: Following an alcohol withdrawal seizure, patients should be admitted to a 11 setting wit h close monitoring available, and should be re -assessed every 1 -2 hours for 6 -24 hours. Patients 12 should be closely monitored for delirium and the need to receive intravenous ( IV) fluids , due to potential 13 electrolyte imbalances . 14 Discussion 15 Patients identif ied as at risk of experiencing an alcohol withdrawal seizure should be closely monitored.20 16 Alcohol withdrawal seizures typically occur between 8 -48 hours after cessation of (or reduction in) 17 alcohol use with risk peaking around 24 hours.20,22 Signs of an impending seizure can include tremors, 18 increased blood pressure, overactive reflexes and high temperature and pulse.15 However, c linicians 19 should be aware that an alcohol withdrawal seizure can occur in the absence of other clinically prominent 20 withdrawal signs or symptoms. Risk of seizure is typically bundled with risk of alcohol withdrawal 21 delirium when evaluating predictive factors12,36,48 -51 (see section II.B: Risk Factors for Severe or 22 Complicated Withdrawal ). 23 Following an alcohol withdrawal seizure, a patient is at increased risk for another seizure and progression 24 to alcohol withdrawal delirium .2,4,52 Patients should be observed for at least 24 hours ,52 or if in a setting 25 where continuous observation is not feasible, observed for a minimum of 6 hours before being discharged 26 to a treatment setting with continuous monitoring. The Guideline Committee recommended that patients 27 be re -assessed at least every 1 -2 hours during the post -seizure mon itoring period. 28 (2) Supportive care 29 Recommendation VI.3: If available and applicable, existing institutional/hospital -associated delirium 30 protocols can be used for supportive care of patients with an alcohol withdrawal s eizure. 31 Discussion 32 Non-pharmacological supportive care for patients with a recent alcohol withdrawal seizure includes safety 33 measures as well as standard care protocols. Safety measures such as fall precautions and standard care 34 100 ADDRESSING COMPLICATIONS protocols such as routine n urse check -ins and assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs) ensures 1 patient safety as well as provides autonomy. Patients with a recent alcohol withdrawal seizure are at 2 increased risk for developing delirium. For facilities with a hospital -associ ated delirium protocol, 3 clinicians should implement the protocol to prevent and reduce the incidence and duration of acute 4 delirium among patients with a recent alcohol withdrawal -related seizure. Studies have shown 5 standardized protocols to be effective a t reducing the incidence, duration, and frequency of delirium 6 among hospitalized patients.117 The Guideline Committee agreed with the use of institutional/hospital - 7 associated delirium protocols, when available. 8 (3) Pharmacotherapy 9 Recommendation VI.4: Following a withdrawal seizure, patients should be immediately treated with a 10 medication effective at prevent ing another seizure . Benzodiazepines are first -line treatment, and a fast- 11 acting agent such as lorazepam or diazepam is preferred. Phenobarbital is also an option but is less 12 preferred to benzodiazepines. 13 Recommendation VI.5: Following a withdrawal seizure, parenteral administration of medications is 14 preferred. If available , IV administration is preferred to intramuscular ( IM), but IM administration is also 15 effective. Parenteral phenobarbital should only be used in highly supervised settings (e.g., Intensive Care 16 Unit [ICU)] or Cardiac/Coronary Care Unit [CCU ]) because of risk of over -sedation and respiratory 17 depression. 18 Recommendation VI.6: It is not recommended to use alpha2 -adrenergic agonists or beta-adrenergic 19 antagonists to prevent or treat alcohol withdrawal seizures because they are ineffective for this purpose. 20 Beta-adrenergic antagonists also can lower the seizure threshold . Phenytoi n should not be used unless 21 treating a concomitant underlying seizure disorder. 22 Discussion 23 Benzodiazepines are effective in the primary and secondary prevention of alcohol withdrawal 24 seizures .13,131 Intravenous (IV) administration of a fast -acting agent such as lorazepam or diazepam is 25 recommended after a withdrawal -related seizure .2,4,21,52 In a randomized, double -blind trial, patients 26 admitted to the emergency depa rtment with an alcohol withdrawal -related seizure were provided either 2 27 mL of saline or 2 mL of lorazepam intravenously to prevent subsequent seizures. The use of intravenous 28 lorazepam was shown to significantly reduce the risk of recurrent seizures .131 29 All patient s presenting with an alcohol withdrawal seizure should have IV access established 30 immediately , which can be used for fluids in the prevention of dehydration as well as the administration 31 of medication.132 IM is also an effective and acceptable route of administration. 32 A prospective study examining the e ffects of phenobarbital for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal and 33 convulsions found that none of the 38 patients who presented with alcohol withdrawal seizures had a 34 subsequent convulsion after the administration of IV phenobarbital.133 A more recent small prospective, 35 randomized tri al comparing phenobarbital to benzodiazepines for the treatment of acute alcohol 36 withdrawal found phenobarbital to be as effective in reducing patient CIWA -Ar scores from baseline to 37 discharge in the emergency department as benzodiazepines .134 38 Phenobarbital as an appropriate option for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal symptoms and prevention 39 of additional seizures. It should be noted that phenobarbital may cause respiratory depression and over - 40 101 ADDRESSING COMPLICATIONS sedation because of its effects on the central nervous system and narrow therapeutic window . 1 Phenobarbital is therefore more commonly used in an inpatient setting , such as the ICU or E mergency 2 Department (ED) where there is continuous supervision. The Guideline Committee recommended caution 3 when using in settings that offer less monitoring than the ICU and ED . Additionally, clinicians who are 4 less familiar with the therapeutic window and have minimal experience with phenobarbital, should use 5 extra caution in case over -sedation or respiratory depression occur s. 6 While animal studies hav e shown that anticonvulsants can prevent seizures and delirium ,4 evidence of 7 their efficacy in humans is mixed, and is insufficient to conclude their effects are superior to 8 benzodia zepines .2,38,107 Also, p heny toin has been shown to be ineffective in preventing the recurrence of 9 seizure and is not recommended , unless the patient is being treated for a concomitant underlying seizure 10 disorder .14,52 11 B. Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium 12 (1) Monitoring 13 Recommendation VI.7: Patients with alcoho l withdrawal delirium should be provided close nursing 14 observation and supportive care , which often necessitates admission to an intensive or critical care unit. 15 Agitated and disoriented patients should have continuou s, one -to-one observation and monitoring. 16 Recommendation VI.8: Patient s with alcohol withdrawal delirium should have their vital signs , 17 oximetry and cardiac status monitored as frequently as required . Resuscitative equipment should be 18 readily available when patients require high doses of benzodiazepines, when continuous infusion of 19 medication is used, or when patients have significant concurrent medical conditions. 20 Recommendation VI.9: To monitor signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawa l delirium, use a structured 21 assessment scale such as the Confusion Assessment Method for ICU Patients (CAM -ICU) , Delirium 22 Detection Score (DDS), Richmond Agitation -Sedation Scale (RASS) , or Minnesota Detoxification Scale 23 (MINDS) . It is not recommended to use the CIWA -Ar in patients with delirium because it relies on 24 patient -report ed symptoms. 25 Discussion 26 Patients experiencing alcohol withdrawal delirium should be provided supportive care in a quiet, well -lit 27 room with continuous monitoring of vital signs by nursing staff .2,13,116 For patients who are disoriented or 28 agitated, one -to-one observati on should be provided .14 The appropriateness of additional monitoring tools 29 and measures depends on (1) the dose and frequency of medication ,2,14 (2) concurrent medical 30 conditions,14 and (3) degree of abnormality of the vital signs. 31 Intravenous administration is commonly use d when treating alcohol withdrawal delirium , but clinicians 32 should be cautious because benzodiazepines, such as diazepam , have a rapid onset of response . Due to 33 this, patients may be at greater risk of respiratory dep ression when these medications are administered 34 intravenously .2 A meta -analysis on the pharmacological management of alcohol withdrawal recommend s 35 having resuscitative equipment readily available when patients require high doses of benzodiazepines, 36 when continuous infusion of medication is used, or w hen patients have significant concurrent medical 37 conditions.14 38 102 ADDRESSING COMPLICATIONS While a structured assessment scale should be used to monitor alcohol withdrawal delirium, the use of th e 1 CIWA -Ar is problematic in patients experiencing delirium. Other scales are effective at identifying and 2 monitoring delirium among patients who are unable to communicate clearly. The Confusion Assessment 3 Method for ICU Patients (CAM -ICU) ,135-137 is a reliable , rapid an d valid instrument for diagnosing 4 delirium among ICU patients and can be used for mechanically ventilated patients as well . The Delirium 5 Detection Score (DDS),138 is another valid and reliable assessment scale used in the ICU . The Richmond 6 Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS)139 has demonstrated reliability and validity in medical and surgical 7 patients, including patients who are sedated and/or ventilated. Although not officially validated, the 8 Minnesota Detoxification Scale (MINDS)140 has been used to assess and monitor patients in the ICU 9 setting. The scale takes less time to administer than the CIWA -Ar and has produced reliable scores that 10 are reflective of the severity of alcohol withdrawal symptoms among patients. 11 (2) Supportive care 12 Recommendation VI.10: Provide immediate intravenous access fo r administration of drugs and fluids to 13 patients experiencing alcohol withdrawal delirium. 14 Recommendation VI.11: If available and applicable, existing institutional/hospital -associated delirium 15 protocols can be used for supportive care of patients with alcohol withdrawal delirium. 16 Recommendation VI.12: Restraints should only be used when required to prevent injuries due to 17 agitation or violence, and in compliance with state laws. 18 Discu ssion 19 Patients experiencing alcohol withdrawal delirium should quickly be provided immediate intravenous 20 access for administration of fluids and medication .41 Intravenous benzodiazepines have been shown to 21 provide more rapid control of signs and symptoms compared to oral administration ,2 which is ideal in 22 treating alcohol withdrawal delirium . However, intravenous administration of benzodiazepines also 23 increases the risk of respiratory depression in patients due the quick onset.2 Patients should be monitored 24 for signs of respiratory depression with resuscitation equipment readily available if needed .14 25 Delirium is an acute state of confusion with impaired cognition that often occurs during hospitalization, 26 especially among elderly patients.117,141,142 Delirium has been associated with increased morbidity, 27 mortality, length of hospital stay, and increased health service utilization .142,143 Early recognition as well 28 as preventative measures are key for the management of the risk of delirium .143,144 Hospital or institutional 29 prevention and treatment protocols can be implemented to reduce the risk of delirium among patients. 30 One study e valuated the effects of a multicomponent intervention on reducing the incidence of delirium 31 among hospitalized patients as well as the duration and frequency of delirious episodes among 852 32 hospitalized patients.117 The intervention utilized standardized protocols that measured six factors for 33 delirium, which were: cognitive impairment, hearing impairment, sleep deprivation, immobility, visual 34 impairment, and dehydration. Results from the st udy showed that implementation of standardized 35 protocols were effective at preventing and reducing the risk of delirium, number of episodes and duration 36 of episodes. Fifteen percent of patients who did not receive the intervention developed delirium compar ed 37 to 9.9% who did receive the intervention. Additionally, patients who received the intervention had a 38 shorter duration compared to those receiving usual car e (105 vs 161 days). The number of episodes were 39 also significantly less among the intervention gr oup (62 vs 90). 40 103 ADDRESSING COMPLICATIONS Sedative medications, such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates are associated with an increased burden 1 of delirium among patients.144 Both medications are commonly used in the treatment of alcohol 2 withdrawal including for patients with alcohol withdrawal delirium . Therefore, these patients should be 3 monitored for early symptoms of delirium and interventions , such a s hospital -associated delirium 4 protocols , should be implemented in addition to routine monitoring . The Guideline Committee agreed 5 with the use of institutional/hospital -associated delirium protocols, when available. 6 Patients experiencing severe alcohol wi thdrawal, particularly alcohol withdrawal delirium, are confused, 7 agitated, and may try to remove peripheral lines.145 Providing early pharmacological management may 8 alleviate signs and symptoms of delirium that are likely to cause patients to attempt to remove peripheral 9 lines, but it may be necessary to use restraints in accordance with state laws, to ensure the safety of 10 patients and staff. 11 (3) Pharmacotherapy 12 Recommendation VI.13: Patients with alcohol withdrawal delirium should be sedated to achieve and 13 maintain a light somnolence. Benzodiazepines are recommended as the first -line agents for managing 14 alcohol withdrawal delirium. 15 Recommendation VI.14: When available, medication sho uld be administered intravenously. The use of 16 intermittent IV administration of long - and short -acting medications is acceptable and effective . 17 Continuous IV infusion is considerably more expensive and there is no evidence of therapeutic 18 superiority. 19 Reco mmendation VI.15: Patients receiving repeated high intravenous doses of lorazepam or diazepam 20 should be monitored closely for signs of hyponatremia and metabolic acidosis. 21 Recommendation VI.16: When treating alcohol withdrawal delirium, use an established dosing protocol 22 as a guide, but individualize dosing regimens based on patient 's signs and symptoms. It is appropriate for 23 patients with alcohol withdrawal delirium to receive intravenous symptom -triggered or fixed -dose front 24 loading . Once light somnolence is achieved and patient s are calm and cooperative, if on IV medication, 25 shifting to oral symptom -triggered treatment is recommended. 26 Recommendation VI.17: Very large doses of benzodiazepines may be needed to control agitation in 27 alcohol withdrawal delirium, including doses that are much higher than typically seen in other patient 28 populations. Clinicians should not hesitate to provide su ch large doses to patients to control agitation but 29 should keep in mind the possible risk of over-sedation and respiratory depression. Moreover, w hen large 30 doses are used, there is risk of accumulation of long -acting benzodiazepine metabolites, especially in 31 patients with impaired hepatic function or the elderly, and patients should be monitored closely. 32 Recommendation VI.18: For patient s who have been delirious longer than 72 hours, assess for drug- 33 induced delirium and withdrawal from another GABAergic agent (such as gabapentin or carisoprodol ). 34 When necessary, adjust the benzodiazepine dose. 35 Recommendation VI.19: Barbiturates can be considered an alternative option to benzodiazepines for the 36 treatment of alcohol withdrawal delirium, but they are not preferred to benzodiazepines. Phenobarbital 37 can be used as an adjunct to benz odiazepines in settings with close monitoring when alcohol withdrawal 38 delirium is not adequately controlled by benzodiazepine therapy alone. 39 104 ADDRESSING COMPLICATIONS Recommendation VI.20: Antipsychotic agents can be used as an adjunct to benzodiazepines when 1 alcohol withdrawal delirium and hallucinations are not adequately controlled by benzodiazepine therapy 2 alone. They are not recommended as monotherapy for alcohol withdrawal delirium. 3 Recommendation VI.21: Alpha2 -adrenergic agonists, beta-adrenergic antagonists and paraldehyde 4 should not be used to treat alcohol withdrawal delirium. 5 Discussion 6 Patients experiencing alcohol withdrawal delirium should be provided enough medication to achieve a 7 light somnolence.14,44,132 The goal or therapeutic endpoint of this recommendation is to help control 8 agitation associated with delirium.14,44 Patient should be in a level of sedation where they are awake, but 9 have a tende ncy to fall asleep unless stimulated. 10 Benzodiazepines are the most commonly used medication to treat patients with delirium because of the 11 favorable therapeutic window .14 Intermittent IV administration of a long -acting medication or continuous 12 IV infusion of short -acting medication are both effective treatments for alcohol withdrawal delirium.14 13 Administering medication intravenously allows for rapid and accurate control over signs and symptoms 14 such as fear, autonomic hyperactivity , and hallucinations .116,146,147 Clinicians should be aware that v ery 15 large doses of benzodiazepines may be required to control del irium and be ready to provide a sufficient 16 amount of medication to effectively treat the symptoms .2 Because intravenous lorazepam and diazepam 17 are both stabilized with propylene glycol, hyponatremia and metabolic acidosi s may occur .2 18 While dosing regimens should be individualized based on the patient's signs and symptoms, using an 19 established dosing protocol as a guide for treatment has been shown to be a safe and effective means of 20 managing alcohol withdrawal delirium.22,148 Symptom -triggered front loading with diazepam has also 21 been shown to reduce the duration of delirium.149 Fixed -dose front loading is also appropriate during the 22 early management of alcohol withdrawal delirium if a withdrawal scale cannot be completed .41,13 2 Once 23 patients have reached a calm state, patients can be shifted to a symptom -triggered approach.70,132 See 24 Appendix III for guidance on the use of scales to guide dosing in patients with communication difficulty. 25 Patients treated with repeated high doses of lorazepam or diazepam require close monitoring due to the 26 rapid onset of action and the risk of accumulation of long -acting benzodiazepine metabolites .2 This 27 accumulation is especially common in patients with im paired hepatic function or among the elderly .2 If a 28 patient has been delirious longer than 72 hours and has been receiving high doses of benzodiazepines (in 29 the thousands of milligrams), the patient may have developed be nzodiazepine -induced delirium. Because 30 the temporal window of alcohol withdrawal seizures has passed, clinicians should consider reducing the 31 benzodiazepine dose and adding an antipsychotic agent to control agitation and/or confusion.2 32 Even if patients are at reduced risk of seizure, antipsychotics should not be used as monotherapy because 33 they lower the seizure threshold . Second generation atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone and 34 quetiapine, are preferred because they have less of an effect on the seizure threshold compared to other 35 antipsychotics.2,44 Haloperidol, a first generation antipsychotic, is also an appropriate agent.2,14,44 36 Antipsychotics may also be used in conjunction with benzodiazepines to control severe agitation and 37 hallucinations associated with early alcohol withdrawal delirium.2,14 Barbiturates are also an appropriate 38 option for treating patients with alcohol withdrawal delirium . A retrospective cohort study found that 39 patients treat ed with 100 -200 mg of phenobarbital (PO or IV) had similar duration of symptoms and 40 length of stay compared to patients who received 10-20 mg of diazepam IV hourly until sedated.147 41 However, barbiturates are not preferred as monotherapy over benzodiazepines due to their narrow 42 105 ADDRESSING COMPLICATIONS therapeutic window and risk of over-sedation and respiratory depression. Phenobarbital may be used in 1 conjunction with benzodiazepines in settings with continuous monitoring available when delirium is not 2 adequately controlled by benzodiazepines. 3 Due to difficulties in administration an d titration of dose, paraldehyde is not recommended for the 4 treatment of alcohol withdrawal delirium .1414 Additionally, alpha2 -adrenergic agonists and beta - 5 adrenergic antagonists should not be used to treat alcohol withdrawal delirium. 6 C. Alcohol -Induced Psychotic Disorder 7 Recommendation VI.22: If available and applicable, existing inst itutional/hospital -associated delirium 8 protocols can be used for supportive care of patients with an alcohol -induced psychotic disorder . 9 Recommendation VI.23: The treatment of alcohol -induced psychotic disorder may require consultation 10 with a psychiatrist. 11 Recommendation VI.24: The treatment of alcohol -induced psychotic disorder may require addition of 12 antipsychotics. 13 Recommendation VI.25: For patients experiencing hallucinations, diazepam may be considered a 14 treatment option. 15 Discussion 16 Alcohol -induced psychosis may develop in patients with drawing from alcohol. Symptoms of alcohol - 17 induced psychosis consist s of auditory hallucinations and possibly visual hallucinations and delusions .44 18 Differ entiating between alcohol -induced psychosis due to alcohol withdrawal and alcohol -induced 19 hallucinations as a complication of chronic alcohol use can be difficult . The DSM -5 illustrates the 20 distinctions between substance -induced psychotic disorders associa ted with intoxication as well as 21 withdrawal and requires clinicians to document and code accordingly .43 Currently, t here is no established 22 pharmaco therapy for the treatment of alcohol -induced psychosis, but a randomized controlled trial of 50 23 patients, showed diazepam to be effective at reducing hallucinations compared to placebo.150 The 24 Guideline Committee rated diazepam as an appropriate medication for the treatment of alcohol -induced 25 psychosis , but they also concluded that it may be necessary to treat these patients with an additional 26 antipsychotic medications to alleviate the symptoms. 27 Patients experiencing alcohol -induced psychosis are at risk of developing acute delirium whi le in the 28 inpatient setting and appropriate hospital -associated delirium protocol s should be implemented , if 29 available , to reduce the risk of delirium and associated health outcomes. 30 D. Resistant Alcohol Withdrawal 31 Recommendation VI.26: If available and applicable, existing institutional/hospital -associated delirium 32 protocols can be use d for supportive care of patients with resistant alcohol withdrawal . 33 Recommendation VI.27: Phenobarbital may be used as an adjunct to benzodiazepines to control resistant 34 alcohol withdrawal syndrome in settings with close monitoring. 35 106 ADDRESSING COMPLICATIONS Recommendation VI.28: Propofol may be used with patients in the ICU experiencing resistant alcohol 1 withdrawal who already require mechanical ventilation. 2 Recommendation VI.29: Dexmedetomidine may be used with patients in the ICU experiencing resistant 3 alcohol withdrawal . 4 Discussion 5 Resistant Alcohol Withdrawal (RAW) is not well defined, but generally describes patients who 6 experienc e severe or complicated withdrawal despite having received high doses of benzodiazepines.97 7 Prior r eviews have defined this as having uncontrolled symptoms despite having received doses of more 8 than 150 -200 mg diazepam or 30 -40 mg lorazepam in the first 3-4 hours of treatment .46,115,151 In such 9 cases, p atients may require the addition of an adjunct medication suc h as phenobarbital, propofol , or 10 dexmedetomidine .46,111,151,152 This phenomenon is also referred to as benzodiazepine -resistant alcohol 11 withdrawal or refractory alcohol withdrawal. 12 There is evidence to support the use of phenobarbital as an adjunct to benzodiazepines in patients with 13 severe withdrawal or RAW .111 A strategy of symptom -triggered escalating doses of diazepam and/or 14 phenobarbital has been shown to reduce the need for mechanical ventilation and showed trends toward 15 reductions in ICU length of stay in patients admitted to the ICU for treatment of alcohol withdrawal 16 syndrome .22 ICU admission was called for if patients required either 200 mg diazepam in 4 hours or an 17 individual dose greater than 40 mg IV diazepam to control agitation. The same strategy has been shown to 18 be effective for patients admitted to the ICU for any reason who also experienced alc ohol withdrawal. 19 Patients treated with the protocol had a reduced ICU length of stay, need for mechanical ventilation and 20 benzodiazepine requirements compared to a group of historical controls treated with physician determined 21 dosing of benzodiazepines alo ne.22,148. 22 Propofol is appropriate as a benzodiazepine adjunct in patients with RAW treated in the ICU.7,97,115 One 23 systematic review of observational studies evaluated the use of propofol as an adjunct for the treatment of 24 patients with RAW .97 The authors concluded that propofol was useful in reducing signs of alcohol 25 withdrawal, but due to the risk of respiratory depression it is only appropriate for patients who already 26 require mechanical vent ilation \"unless other adjuvant therapies and methods of BZD [benzodiazepine] 27 administration have proved to be ineffective.\"97 (p. 441) 28 Dexmedetomidine is appropriate as a benzodiazepine adjunct in patients with RAW being treated in the 29 ICU. Three systematic reviews of primarily observational studies on the use of dexmedetomidine in the 30 ICU were found.115,153,154 These authors concluded that dexmedetomidine is a useful adjunct for treating 31 patients with RAW , although monitoring for bradycardia is required. Two randomized controlled trials 32 were found on the use of dexmedetomidin e as a benzodiazepine adjunct in ICU patients.155,156 Both 33 studies found that the use of dexmedetomidine increased sedation quality (reduced agitation) and 34 decreased benzodiazepine requirements in the 24 -hours after dexmedetomidine administrat ion but also 35 increased the incidence of bradycardia. A reduction in total benzodiazepine dose is thought to reduce the 36 potential for prolonged delirium and sedation seen in these patients.153 37 One study compared the effectiveness of propofol to dexmedetomidine in treati ng ICU patients 38 experiencing RAW and found that both agents were similarly effective in reducing signs and symptoms 39 of withdrawal and benzodiazepine requirements .97 However, propofol was associated with fewer 40 instances of bradycardia but more instances of hypotension compared to dexmedetomidine .97 This study 41 107 ADDRESSING COMPLICATIONS and others have stressed the need to better define RAW and for further we ll-controlled, prospective trials 1 to define the role of dexmedetomidine and propofol in the treatment of RAW.97,153 2 Hospital or institutional prevention and treatment protocols can be implemented to reduce the risk of 3 delirium among patients. Studies have shown standardized protocols to be effective at reducing the 4 incidence, duration, and frequency of delirium among ho spitalized patients.1175 108 SPECIFIC SETTINGS & POPULATIONS VII. Specific Settings and Populations 1 In this section, we highlight settings where non -addiction specialty clinicians are likely to encounter 2 patients at risk for or e xperiencing alcohol withdrawal ( primary care) , settings with unique resources 3 (Emergency Departments and hospitals ) and patient populations who require treatment plan modifications 4 (patients with medical conditions, patients who take opioids , and patients who are pregnant). 5 A. Primary Care 6 Primary care is a setting where generalist clinicians may be the first point of contact for patients at risk for 7 or experiencing alcohol withdrawal . They may prescribe medication for alcohol withdrawal management . 8 Crucially, they may be the best -placed practitioner to engage patients in long -term follow -up care 9 following the acute withdrawal period. This section is not intended to provide a set of recommendations 10 for primary care settings separate from ambulatory Level 1 -WM settings. Primary care clinicians should 11 follow recommendations outlined in sections I. Identification and Diagnos is, II. Initial Assessment , and 12 III. Level of Care Determination before initiating alcohol withdrawal management. If providing alcohol 13 withdrawal management, they should follow recommendations outlined in the section IV. Ambulatory 14 Management of Alcohol Withdrawal . 15 Recommendation VII.1: If patients are expe riencing severe withdrawal (e.g., CIWA -Ar scores 19), 16 refer them directly to the nearest Emergency Department . 17 Recommendation VII.2: If withdrawal is mild (e.g., CIWA -Ar <10), patients presenting to primary care 18 can be prescribed a few doses of benzodiazepine . Whenever possible, medication dispensing can be 19 supervised by a caregiver at home or staff at a nonmedical withdrawal management center. Do not 20 presc ribe medication to patients for ambulatory management of alcohol withdrawal without performin g 21 an adequate assessment . 22 Recommendation VII.3: If withdrawal does not resolve (e.g., fall below a CIWA -Ar score of 10) after 23 an adequate dose of medication (e.g., 80 mg diazepam), or patients appears sedated, transfer to an 24 Emergency Department or other inpatient withdrawal management setting. 25 Recommendation VII.4: For patients treated in primary care settings, regular follow -up visits, at least 26 monthly for one ye ar, could increase the likelihood of sustained recovery. 27 Discussion 28 During assessment, if patient s are determined to be experiencing severe withdrawal (e.g., CIWA -Ar 29 scores 19) , they should be immediately transferred to the Emergency Department ( ED) or other setting 30 with the resources to manage complications that might arise .72 When considering prescribing medication 31 to a patient for alcohol withdrawal, clinicians should first assess the patient for risk factors of severe, 32 complicated , or complications of withdrawal (see II. Initial Assessment of Alcohol Withdrawal ). For 33 patients with mild withdrawal (e.g., CIWA -Ar <10) , clinicians may prescribe patients a few doses of 34 medication .72 Whenever possible, have a support ive caregiver or withdrawal management center staff 35 dispense the medication .157 If it is possible to dispense or observe medication administration on-site, if 36 patients ' withdrawal does not resolve (e.g., fall below a CIWA -Ar score of 10) after an adequate dose of 37 109 SPECIFIC SETTINGS & POPULATIONS medication , show a worsening of symptoms , or appear sedated should be transf erred to the ED or a 1 specialized withdrawal management facility with 24 -hour superv ision . 2 Implementation of nonpharmacological support in the management of alcohol withdrawal among patients 3 treated in a primary care setting may increase the likelihood of sustained recovery compared to patients 4 who do not receive additional nonpharmacological su pport .82 According to one outpatient withdrawal 5 protocol, nonpharmacological support such as monthly, routine follow -up appointments for one year with 6 a primary health care provider , offers support in the recovery process and can increase abstinence . 7 B. Emergency Departments 8 Emergency Departments (EDs) are unique medical setting s that do not fit neatly into the categories of 9 ambulatory or inpatient settings. They have the resources of a hospital and frequently see patients in 10 moderate or severe withdrawal. While alcohol withdrawal can be managed in the ED until it resolves , 11 most patients will be stabilized and leave with a referral for continuing withdrawal management and/or 12 alcohol use disorder treatment . 13 Recomme ndation VII.5: If patients are experiencing severe alcohol withdrawal (e.g., CIWA -Ar 19) or 14 are at risk of complicated withdrawal, administer medication immediately to treat withdrawal and reduce 15 the risk of seizu res and delirium. 16 Recommendation VII.6: Patients presenting with alcohol withdrawal syndrome in the E mergency 17 Department should be evaluated for delirium as well as other conditions that mimic and/or accompany 18 withdrawal. Patients presenting with delirium should be assessed for all potential etiologies including 19 alcohol withdrawal. 20 Recommendation VII.7: Patients in the E mergency Department should receive a complete blood count 21 and complete metabolic panel including liv er enzyme and magnesium tests; alcohol withdrawal treatment 22 should not be delayed while waiting for results. 23 Recommendation VII.8: The following indicators sh ould be present for discharge to an ambulatory 24 alcohol withdrawal management setting from the Emergency Department : 25 Mild alcohol withdrawal (e.g., CIWA -Ar score <10). 26 Moderate alcohol withdrawal (e.g. CIWA -Ar score 10 -18) with no other complicating factors 27 Not currently intoxicated (including alcohol or other drugs) 28 No history of complicated alcohol withdrawal (seizures, delirium) 29 No significant medical or psychiatric comorbidities that would complicate withdrawal 30 management 31 Able to comply with ambulatory visits and therapy 32 Recommendation VII.9: Patients with controlled withdrawal syndrome being discharged from the 33 Emerge ncy Department may be offered a short term (e.g., 1 -2 day) prescription for appropriate alcohol 34 withdrawal medication to last until follow -up with their healthcare provider. 35 Discussion 36 The Guideline Committee recommends that alcohol withdrawal management be initiated in the ED. This 37 might include diagnosis and assessment, management of acute signs and symptoms, and referral to 38 inpatient or ambulatory treatment. The signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal often mimic or mask a 39 110 SPECIFIC SETTINGS & POPULATIONS wide variety of other health conditions and it is recommended that all patients entering the ED with 1 alcohol withdrawal be given a thorough evaluation .152 The etiology of signs and symptoms and 2 identification of coexisting illnesses that may precipitate alcohol withdrawal should be determined from 3 the evaluation .152 While assessing patien ts, clinicians should be aware that severe intoxication can mimic 4 alcohol withdrawal and often lead to confusion, delirium, tachycardia and diaphoresis .126 A serum ethanol 5 level may be necessary to determine etiology if the patient history is inconclusive .126 Clinicians can obtain 6 a complete blood count and metabolic panel including liver enzymes and magnesium test to identify 7 factors that may complicate alcohol withdrawal management. 8 As in any setting, patients experiencing severe withdrawal ( e.g., CIWA -Ar score 19) or who are at risk 9 of severe, complicated , or complications of withdrawal , should be provided medication immediately to 10 treat withdrawal signs and symptoms and reduce the risk of developing more severe withdrawal .73 Among 11 patients with co -occurring illnesses, the likelihood of developing delirium is higher and they should be 12 provided aggressive treatment of both conditi ons.158 13 Patients can be referred to an ambulatory setting and discharged once the ir symptoms have stabilized 14 (e.g., CIWA -Ar score < 10). While patients experiencing moderate withdrawal (e.g., CIWA -Ar 10 -18) 15 may be eligible for ambulatory withdrawal management, the Guideline Committee emphasized that not 16 all clinicians may be comfortable managing patients with moderate withdrawal in this setting and the 17 decision to do so is at the discretion of the treating clinician. When discharging patient s to an ambulatory 18 setting, clinicians may provide patients with a short -term (e.g., 1 -2 day) presc riptio n for 19 benzodiazepines .159 The Guideline Committee does not recommen d providing a short -term prescription to 20 patients currently intoxicated (including alcohol or other drugs) or discharging patients to an ambulatory 21 setting if they have a history of complicated alcohol withdrawal and withdrawal has not fully resolved . A 22 simple referral may not be adequate when patients are being discharged from the Emergency Department. 23 Section III. Level of Care Determination provides guidance on determining an appropriate level of care to 24 which to refer the patient. A warm hand -off should be used to ensure the patient made the transition to the 25 next level of care . This may includ e arranging the appointment in t he presence of the patient, arranging 26 for transportation of the patient to the treatment setting , and following up to ensure effective engagement 27 in care. 28 C. Hospitalized Patients 29 This section specifically pertains to patients who are hospitalized for a primary complaint other than 30 alcohol withdra wal who then subsequently develop or are at risk of developing alcohol withdrawal during 31 their hospitalization. 32 (1) Identification 33 Recommendation VII.10: All patients admitted to the hospital should be screened for risk of alcohol 34 withdrawal. Among hospitalized patients, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT ) and 35 Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test -Piccinelli Consumption ( AUDIT -PC) can indicate risk of 36 developing alcohol withdrawal. 37 Recommendation VII.11: Patients undergoing elective surgery should be screened for unhealthy alcohol 38 use and the need to undergo alcohol withdrawal management bef ore proceeding with surgery. Patients 39 111 SPECIFIC SETTINGS & POPULATIONS undergoing elective surgery who are at risk of alcohol withdrawal should undergo medically managed 1 withdrawal before proceeding with surgery 2 Discussion 3 The Guideline Committee recommends that all patients in the hospi tal setting be screened for unhealthy 4 alcohol use and assessed for the risk of alcohol withdrawal , if appropriate. Screening and assessment 5 should include the use of a validated scale, information from collateral sources such as friends or family 6 members and medical clinicians, and laboratory tests. For patients undergoing elective surgery, an alcohol 7 withdrawal risk assessment should be cond ucted prior to surgery, if necessary , because of the 8 postoperative risks and complications associated with alcohol withdrawal.2 9 Unhealthy alcohol use screens with demonstrated ability to identify patients at risk of developing alcohol 10 withdrawal in general hospital settings include the AUDIT and AUDIT -PC.31 The AUDIT is a 10 -item 11 instrument developed to screen for likelihood of the respondent having and alcohol use disorder .160 A 12 large prospective study of p atients admitted to an acute medical unit found that admission AUDIT score 13 8 identified patient s who developed alcohol withdrawal with 100% sensitivity and 90.5% specificity.35 14 While onl y 17.3% of patients who screened positive went on to develop alcohol withdrawal, no patients 15 with an AUDIT score < 8 experienced withdrawal. This makes clear the point that these instruments 16 should be used as screens; patients who screen positive should be further assessed prior to a diagnosis and 17 treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome.35 The AUDIT -PC, a shortened version of the AUDIT, 18 identified patients who experienced alcohol withdrawal syndrome in medical and surgical unit s with 91% 19 sensitivity and 90% specificity using an admission AUDIT -PC score 4.29 20 (2) Assessment 21 Recommendation VII .12: Among hospitalized patients, the Prediction of Alcohol Withdrawal Severity 22 Scale ( PAWSS ) can be used for predicting risk of developing severe or c omplicated alcohol withdrawal 23 in the medically ill. 24 Recommendation VII.13: Patients for whom alcohol withdrawal is suspected and for whom a complete 25 medical history is not available, (i.e., are admitted from the Emergency Department, trauma unit, or are in 26 Intensive Care Unit [ICU] ) or who are known to be at high risk of complicated alcohol withdrawal, 27 medical decisions should be oriented toward a more aggressive treatment of alcohol withdrawal 28 regardless of presenting signs and symptoms. 29 Recommendation VII.14: For patients who requir e more than standard amounts of medication to 30 manage alcohol withdrawal , individualized assessment by clinician s experienced in the management of 31 withdrawal is recommended . The medication and protocol used for treating other conditions and/or 32 alcohol withdrawal syndrome may need to be modified. 33 Discussion 34 Clinicians can use validated scales such as the Prediction of Alcohol Withdrawal Severity Scale 35 (PAWSS)29 to identify patients at risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal in the 36 hospital settin g. The PAWSS is designed to asses patients who are medically ill and has been validated by 37 prospective studies, which compared the PAWSS with retrospective chart review and the CIWA -Ar.29,47 38 112 SPECIFIC SETTINGS & POPULATIONS See section II.C: Risk Assessment Tools for more information on the PAWSS. Additional information on 1 the scale and its features can be found in Appendix III. 2 When a patient's medical history is unavai lable and it is unclear if the patient has a co -occurring medical 3 condition or is at high risk of complicated alcohol withdrawal, clinicians should be prepared for such 4 events and orient care towards more aggressive treatment regardless of current signs an d symptoms. 5 Patients with co -occurring medical diseases may be at risk of developing complications associated with 6 withdrawal and clinicians should consult with appropriate medical professionals from different specialties 7 (e.g. infectious diseases, cardio logy, pulmonary medicine, hematology, neurology, and surgery) when 8 necessary. Patients identified with underlying cardiac conditions should be provided aggressive 9 withdrawal treatment due to the potential of alcohol withdrawal worsening cardiac symptoms .4 10 Patients with co -occurring medical conditions may require modifications to medication regimens and 11 protocols in order to minimize potentially harmful effects related to exacerbati on of these conditions .4 12 However, if a patient experiences withdrawal signs and symptoms that are not easily controlled, 13 consultation with an addiction specialist is warranted to ensure patient safety.2 14 (3) Monitoring 15 Recommen dation VII.15: In patients who are hospitalized, monitor their vital signs . Fluid intake and 16 output and serum electrolytes should be monitored as clinically indicated . 17 Recommendation VII.16: Signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal should be monitored duri ng the 18 course of withdrawal with a validated symptom assessment scale. Assess the risk for scores on a symptom 19 assessment scale to be confounded by the use of certain medications, the presence of certain medical 20 conditions (e.g. fever from infection), or a patient's difficulty communicating. Among general 21 medical/surgical patients, low withdrawal scores can typically be interpreted with confidence , while high 22 scores should be interpreted with caution. The use of alternative scales with patients with difficulty 23 communicating is appropriate. 24 Recommendation VII.17: Patients with a reduced level of consciousness who are at risk for the 25 development of alcohol withdrawal should b e monitored for the appearance of alcohol withdrawal signs . 26 If a co -occurring clinical condition worsens, do not assume it is related to alcohol withdrawal among 27 alcohol withdrawal patients. However, immediate treatment is required if alcohol withdrawal de velops 28 after surgery or trauma. 29 Discussion 30 Although the use of validated scales is recommended in the hospital setting, clinicians should be 31 particularly cognizant of the risk for scores to be affected by comorbid conditions and/or interventions for 32 those conditions . Choose a withdrawal scale that can be administer to patients who are critically ill or 33 have reduced consciousness (s ee Appendix III ). Low withdrawal scores can typically be interpreted with 34 confidence, although b eta-adrenergic antagonists (beta -blockers) and other sympatholytic drugs may 35 mask the signs and symptoms of withdrawal and lead to low scores.2 However, high scores have 36 alternative causes that are common in medical/surgical patients and must be interpreted with caution. 37 Patients who have a reduced level of consciousness due to trauma or general surgery should be monitored 38 for the appearance of signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal to provide appropriate t reatment .7 39 Clinicians should not necessarily assume that worsening symptoms in patients in or at risk for alcohol 40 113 SPECIFIC SETTINGS & POPULATIONS withdrawal are related to alcohol withdrawal .161 Patients in the ICU are at an increased risk of adverse 1 changes due to their illness and worsening condition ; however, these changes may be the result of another 2 medical condition . 3 (4) Supportive care 4 Recommendation VII.18: Clinicians should administer thiamine to ICU patients with signs or symptoms 5 that mimic or mask Wernicke encephalopathy . 6 Discussion 7 Due to the risks associated with thiamine deficiency among patients experiencing alcohol withdrawal, it is 8 common practice t o provide thiamine to prevent Wernicke encephalopathy162-164 Patients in the ICU with 9 a condition that may mask or mimic signs and symptoms associated with WE should receive thiamine . 10 Thiamine is required for basic cellular functioning and carbohydrate metabolism .164 Because the body i s 11 unable to synthesize thiamine, daily ingestion is necessary for routine functioning and maintaining 12 homeostasis . If there is insufficient thiamine in the body, a patient may develop a thiamine deficiency 13 such as Wernicke encephalopathy .163,165,166 Patients who consume large amount s of alcohol are 14 particularly susceptible to thiamine deficiencies due to inadequate dietary intake as well as biological 15 interactions between cellular enzymes and alcohol.163,166 For example, alcohol inhibits thiamine 16 pyrophosphokinase, a responsible for synthesizing thiamine diphosphate (TDP) from thiamine, 17 while also increasing the activity of an enzyme that is responsible for the degradation of TDP.166 The 18 effects of alcohol on both of these enzyme s results in a reduction of available TDP within the cell and 19 ultimately inhibits cellular metabolism. 20 (5) Pharmacotherapy 21 Recommendation VII.19: Prophylactic treatment of alcohol withdrawal should be provided in the ICU 22 to patients who are suspected to be physiologically dependent on alcohol. 23 Recommendation VII.20: Implementing an alcohol withdrawal management protocol in the ICU is 24 appropriate. When using a symptom -triggered d osing protocol, use a validated scale to monitor signs and 25 symptoms. For patients being treated in ICU settings for alcohol withdrawal, existing scales that are 26 appropriate to use for monitoring withdrawal include the Richmond Agitation -Sedation Scale (RAS S). 27 Administration of medications via the intravenous route is preferred because of the rapid onset of action 28 and more predictable bioavailability . 29 Discussion 30 Because alcohol withdrawal can cause significant morbidity among patients in the critical care s etting, 31 patients admitted to the ICU may receive prophylaxis to reduce the risk of developing alcohol 32 withdrawal .167 Additionally, patients should be monitored for worsening signs and symptoms and 33 development of Wernicke encephalopathy . Typically, a multivitamin infusion or \"banana bag\" is given to 34 patients in the ICU to prevent Wernicke encephalopathy . One study examined the effectiveness of the 35 standard protocol commonly used in the ICU to prevent Wernicke encephalopathy when signs and 36 symptoms are masked or mimicked by oth er illnesses .168 The findings recommended a bandoning the 37 114 SPECIFIC SETTINGS & POPULATIONS \"banana bag\" approach and provid e patients with 200 -500 mg IV thiamine every 8 hours, 64 mg/kg 1 magnesium sulfate, and 400 -1,000 mcg IV folate for patients with signs or symptoms that mimic or mask 2 Wernicke encephalopathy. As mentioned, patients also receiving glucose can be administered thiamine 3 and glucose in any order or concurrently. 4 Intravenous administration of benzodiazepines has been recommended for I CU patients due to the rapid 5 onset of action.161 The Gui deline Committee recommends a standard protocol, such as symptom -triggered 6 benzodiazepine therapy in the ICU. Systematic reviews show that symptom -triggered therapy is 7 beneficial among critically ill patients50,89 and showed a reduction in the need for mechanical 8 ventilation .50 A combination of symptom -triggered therapy with the use of a validated scale designed for 9 dosing in patients that are unable to communicate or have comorbidities has been shown to be effective .89 10 When u sing symptom -triggered dosing, using validated scales specific for ICU patients such as the 11 Richmond Agitation -Sedation Scale ,7,115 the Confusion Assessment Method for ICU Patients ,161,167 or the 12 Minnesota Detoxification Scale115,140,161,167 is recommended. 13 D. Patients with Medical C onditions 14 This section is relevant to patients with comorbid medical conditions who are treated in any setting. 15 Recommendation VII.21: For patients with medical comorbidities , modify the m edication and/or 16 protocol used for treating alcohol withdrawal syndrome as necessary in consultation with other 17 specialists. 18 Recommendation VII.22: For patients with medical conditions that prevent the use of oral medication, 19 provide intravenous or intramuscular medications as necessary. 20 Recommendation VII.23: Aggress ive withdrawal treatment is indicated for patients with cardiovascular 21 disorders due to risk of harm associated with autonomic hyperactivity. 22 Recommendation VII.24: For patients with a medical condition associated with impaired hepatic 23 function, adjust med ication dose or use medications with less dependence on hepatic metabolism. 24 Discussion 25 The main differences in managing alcohol withdrawal in patients with co -occurring medical conditions 26 arises from the need to modify medications used and protocols implem ented. The presence of alcohol 27 withdrawal can exacerbate other conditions and illnesses , particularly cardiovascular disease including 28 coronary artery disease . For example, the autonomic arousal (e.g., elevated blood pressure , increased 29 pulse) associated w ith even mild alcohol withdrawal can exacerbate an underlying cardiac condition.4 30 Cardiac conditions should be identified early and aggressive treatment is warranted. Clinicians may want 31 to provide at least a single dose of a benzodiazepine to prevent the development of even minor 32 withdrawal symptoms. Other treatment plan modifications might be needed due to impaired liver 33 functioning, medication interactions , or a medical condition that prevents administration of oral 34 medication.58 When treating patients with com orbidities, clinicians should consult with appropriate 35 medical professionals from different specialties (e.g. infectious diseases, cardiology, pulmonary medicine, 36 hematology, neurology, and surgery) when necessary. 37 115 SPECIFIC SETTINGS & POPULATIONS E. Patients w ho Take Opioids 1 Recommendation VII.25: Patients who are on chronic opioid medication (opioid agonist therapy for 2 opioid use disorder or pain) should be monitored closely when benzodiazepines are prescribed, due to the 3 increase d risk of respiratory depression . Similarly, patients taking sedative -hypnotic medications exhibit 4 tolerance to benzodiazepines and should be monitored closely for appropriate dose. 5 Recommendation VII.26: For patients with concomitant alcohol withdrawal and opioid use disorder, 6 stabilize opioid use disorder (e.g. with methadone or buprenorphine) concomitantly with treating alcohol 7 withdrawal. 8 Discussion 9 Patients with concomitant substance use or patients who are currently receiving opioid therapy require 10 special attention and monitoring. The Guideline Committee emphasized that patients with concomitant 11 substance use , in general, are managed similarly to other patients, but special attention should be given to 12 monitoring signs and symptoms. Benzodiazepines may be given but should be used w ith caution and only 13 in facilities with close monitoring. Patients receiving opioid agonist therapy with concomitant alcohol 14 withdrawal should be admitted and managed in a hospital setting or other setting with the resources to 15 manage increased risk of res piratory depression and other complications. 16 Patients who are using sedative -hypnotic medication are at higher risk of major complications and may 17 exhibit tolerance to benzodiazepines and require dose adjustment. These patients should be monitored 18 closely .13 19 F. Patients who are Pregnant 20 (1) Level of care and monitoring 21 Recommendation VII.2 7: Inpatient treatment should be considered for all pregnant patients with alcohol 22 use disorder who require withdrawal management. Inpatient treatment should be offered to pregnant 23 patients with at least moderate alco hol withdrawal (i.e., CIWA -Ar scores 10). 24 Recommendation VII.2 8: The CIWA -Ar is an appropriate symptom assessment scale to use with 25 pregnant patients . Pregnancy is not expected to bias scores on symptom assessment scales. Clinicians 26 should consider signs and symptoms such as nausea, headache, anxiety, and insomnia to be connected to 27 alcohol withdrawal rather than pregnancy and presume they will abate once the alcohol withdrawal has 28 been effectively treated. 29 Recommendation VII. 29: During withdrawal management, consult with an obstetrician . 30 Discussion 31 Inpatient treatment should be considered for all pregnant patients with alcohol withdrawal given the risk 32 of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder including fetal alcohol syndrome and the risk of abruption, preterm 33 delivery, and fetal distress or demise due to continued alcohol use during pregnancy .169 While inpatient 34 management is not more effective than ambulatory management for patients who are appropriat ely 35 116 SPECIFIC SETTINGS & POPULATIONS matched to level of care, it does limit exposure to alcohol. If patients are experiencing at least moderate 1 alcohol withdrawal (i.e., CIWA -Ar 10) and are pregnant, the VA/DoD58 recommend patients be treated 2 at an inpatient facility that has medical withdrawal supervision. 3 Pregnancy is not expected to bias scores on symptom assessment scales when assessing withdrawal 4 severity during the initial assessment and monitoring . Clinicia ns can consider signs and symptoms such as 5 nausea, headache, anxiety, and insomnia to be connected to alcohol withdrawal . The y can further presum e 6 these symptoms will abate once alcohol withdrawa l has been effectively treated. 7 The Guideline Committee recommend s consulting with an obstetrician when managing alcohol 8 withdrawal in a pregnant patient. F etal monitoring appropriate to the stage of pregnancy may be 9 warranted due to risk of abruption, preterm delivery, and fetal distress or demise.169 10 (2) AUD treatment initiation and engagement 11 Recommendation VII.3 0: Engagement in treatment for AUD is particularly important for pregnant 12 patients with alcohol withdrawal given the risk of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder ( FASD ) including 13 Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) . 14 Discussion 15 The Guideline Committee emphasized the importance of engaging pregnant patients in ongoing treatment 16 for alcohol use disorder given the risk of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder including fetal alcohol syndrome 17 and the risk of abruption, preterm delivery, and fetal distress or demise due to continued alcohol use 18 during pregnancy .169 As discussed in the ambulatory and withdrawal management section s, the presence 19 of alcohol withdrawal almost universally signifies the presence of an alcohol use disorder and need for 20 treatment. Alcohol withdrawal management alone is not an effective treatment for alcohol use disorder. 21 The period of w ithdrawal manageme nt should include the process of initiating and engaging patients in 22 treatment for alcohol use disorder. 23 (3) Pharmacotherapy 24 Recommendation VII.3 1: Before giving any medications to pregnant patients, ensure that patient s 25 understand the risks and benefits of the medication, both for the patient and the developing fetus. 26 Recommendation VII.3 2: Benzodiazepines and barbiturates are the medications of choice in treatment 27 of pregnant patients with alcohol withdrawal. While ther e is a risk of teratogenicity during the first 28 trimester, the risks appear small, and they are balanced in view of the risk for fetal alcohol spectrum 29 disorder and consequences to mother and fetus should severe maternal alcohol withdrawal develop. 30 Recommen dation VII.3 3: Due to the high teratogenic risk, valproic acid is not recommended for 31 pregnant patients. 32 Recommendation VII.3 4: For patients at risk for pre -term delivery or in the late third trimester , use of a 33 short -acting benzodiazepine is recommended . This minimizes the risk for neonatal benzodiazepine 34 intoxication given shorter onset and duration of action. 35 117 SPECIFIC SETTINGS & POPULATIONS Discussion 1 In SAMHSA's TIP 45,4 the importance of educating patients about the risks and benefits associated with 2 alcohol withdrawal treatment medication is emphasized. Due to the potential risks imposed on both the 3 patient and developing fetus during withdrawal, it is recommended that patients provide informed consent 4 confirming they have received and understand the risks associated with treatment.4 5 For patients planning to take medication to treat withdrawal , the World Health Organization ( WHO )170 6 suggests clinicians use the CIWA -Ar to facilitate alcohol withdrawal management. 7 A systematic review found consensus regarding the use of benzodiazepines and barbi turates during 8 pregnancy.13 Although both medications are considered teratogenic and have been associated with 9 adverse effects on the fetus, these risks appear small and must be weigh ed against the risk of harm to the 10 patient and fetus should severe alcohol withdrawal or seizures develop in pregnant patient s. The WHO 's 11 guidelines170 also recommend short -term use of a long -acting benzodiazepine to treat pregnant patients 12 who develop alcohol withdrawal. When using medication to treat alcohol withdrawal among pregnant 13 patients, limit the amount of medication to only what is necessary to prevent major complications of 14 withdrawal .13 For patients at risk for pre -term delivery or in the late third trimester, use of a short -acting 15 benzodiazepine is recommended. This minimizes the risk for neonatal benzodiazepine intoxication given 16 shorter onset and duration of action. Valproic acid should not be used in pregnant patient s because of 17 teratogenic risk.110 18 (4) Newborn considerations 19 Recommendation VII.3 5: In cases of alcohol withdrawal treated close to delivery, assess the newborn 20 for benzodiazepine intoxication , sedative withdrawal , and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) 21 including Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) . 22 Reco mmendation VII.3 6: Inform pregnant patients of all wraparound services that will assist them in 23 addressing newborn needs, including food, shelter, pediatric clinics for inoculations, as well as programs 24 that will help with developmental or physical issues that the newborn may experience as a result of in- 25 utero substance exposure. 26 Recommendation VII.3 7: Licensed clinical staff have an obligation to understand and follow their state 27 laws regarding substance use during pregnancy which may include definitions of child abuse and neglect, 28 reporting requirements, and plans of safe care for newborns with in -utero alcohol exposure . 29 Discussion 30 If a pregnant patient's alcohol withdrawal was treated close to delivery, n ewborns should be monitored 31 for signs of FASD and sedative withdrawal and intoxication if withdrawal was managed with medication. 32 As recommended by SAMHSA, pregnant patients be made aware of wraparound services that will help 33 them with newborn concerns as well as programs that will help with developmental or physical issues that 34 the neonate may experience as a result of in-utero alcohol exposure .4 It is the clinician's responsibility to 35 know state laws regarding drug use during pregnancy as well as the definitions of child abuse and neglect 36 to reassure and encourage patients to enter treatment .4 Clinicians should also know the reporting 37 requirements for such cases4 and should discuss them with patie nts. 38 118 AREAS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH Areas for Further Research 1 Identification and Diagnosis: 2 Further research is warranted on evidence -based strategies to identify alcohol withdrawal in various 3 settings including primary care, E mergency Departments , and medical/surgical units in hospitals. 4 Research would include the appropriate use of validated screening instruments, testing to rule out 5 alternative diagnoses, and laboratory tests for alcohol and other drug use. 6 Initial Assessment: 7 Areas for further research in alcohol withdrawal assessment include the development and testing of scale s 8 to predict the risk of alcohol withdrawal (and the risk of severe withdrawal) . Further research on assessing 9 the risk of severe alcohol withdrawal would include the relative importance of predictors , as well as 10 additional research on individual risk factors for complicated withdrawal/complications of withdrawal. 11 Furthermore, for clinicians in ambulatory settings, further research on triaging patients based on risk 12 would help guide clinical practice. 13 Level of Care Determination: 14 Further research on the role of The ASAM Criteria Risk Matrix in determining appropriate level of care 15 for individuals with alcohol withdrawal would be welcome. In particular, evidence -based improvements 16 in the assessment of the recovery environment and available social support networks would be helpful to 17 determine appropriateness for ambulatory management. 18 Ambulatory Management: 19 Further research on optimal monitoring intervals at various levels of care would be useful in guiding 20 clinical practice. The literature revealed a wide variety of recommendations for monitoring frequency and 21 intensity. 22 While the importance of supportive c are is widely recognized, it is not well -researched. Additional 23 research on individualizing nutritional supplementation and alternative interventions for symptom 24 management (e.g., acupuncture, massage, etc.) would be helpful. 25 Finally, further research is needed on the design and implementation of effective strategies to transition 26 patients from alcohol withdrawal management to AUD treatment initiation and engagement. Comparative 27 effectiveness studies of various models and strategies for linkages to care wo uld be particularly helpful , as 28 would investigation into the moderating or mediating influence of patient and setting factors . 29 Inpatient Management : 30 Several promising medications have not yet been well -researched. Hence, large, well -controlled studies of 31 specific medications would be helpful in expanding the options for individualization of alcohol 32 withdrawal management. Some examples of useful comparative trials include phenobarbital vs. or as 33 adjunct to benzodiazepines, ketamine as adjunct to other medic ations, carbamazepine vs. gabapentin. 34 Further research on managing resistant or refractory withdrawal is also needed. 35 119 AREAS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH Addressing Complicated Alcohol Withdrawal: 1 There is a minimal literature on the management of alcohol -induced psychosis associated with alcohol 2 withdrawal . Although the Guideline Committee agreed with the one study conducted by Sellers in 1983, 3 there is insufficient evidence to support the use of other medications to control for alcohol -induced 4 psychosis during withdrawal. Further research on differentiating between alcohol -induced intoxication 5 and alcohol -induced withdrawal as well as the management for both is warranted. 6 Specific Settings and Populations : 7 The literature and Guideline Committee agreed that clinically sign ificant alcohol withdrawal is rare 8 among adolescents, and this special population was beyond the scope of the current guideline. However, 9 further research on potential modifications to alcohol withdrawal management protocols for adolescents 10 would be useful . Other special populations in need of further research include the elderly and criminal 11 justice populations. 12 120 APPENDICES 1 121 APPENDICES Appendices 1 I. Cited References 2 II.

To diagnose alcohol withdrawal, use a diagnostic criteria such as the DSM -5 diagnostic criteria. 9 2. To diagnose alcohol use disorder, use diagnostic criteria such as those provided by the DSM -5. 9 x x x 3. If a patient is known to be using alcohol recently, regularly, and heavily, clinicians should assess for the risk of alcohol withdrawal even in the absence of symptoms. 9 4. Universal screening for at -risk alcohol use should be incorporated into medical settings to help identify patients at risk of alcohol use disorders and alcohol withdrawal. 9 x x x 5. If a patient has symptoms suggestive of alcohol withdrawal, clinicians should assess the quantity, frequency, and time of day when alcohol is consumed to determine whether the patient could be experiencing alcohol withdrawal. 9 6. To assess the quantity and frequency of the patient's alcohol use to assist with diagnosis of alcohol withdrawal, tools that screen for unhealthy alcohol use can be helpful. 8.5 Moderate 7. To assess the quantity, frequency and time of day when alcohol is consumed to assist with diagnosis of alcohol withdrawal, collateral information (i.e. from family and friends) can be helpful. 9 Moderate 8. For patients who are unable to communicate or otherwise unable to give a history, blood tests, breath tests, and urine tests may help the clinician assess the quantity and frequency of the patient's alcohol use. 7.5 Moderate 9. To assess a patient's recent heavy use of alcohol to assist with diagnosis of alcohol withdrawal, a laboratory test that provides some measure of hepatic function can be helpful. 8 Moderate 10. Negative biological tests for alcohol use do not exclude the presence or risk of developing alcohol withdrawal. 9 11. Clinicians should understand that the CIWA -Ar is not a diagnostic instrument. 9 Moderate 12. Clinicians should be aware that other serious illnesses can mimic the signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. 9 13. Clinicians should be aware that the effects of certain medications can mimic the signs of alcohol withdrawal while others can mask them. 9 Moderate 14. Differential diagnosis of alcohol withdrawal is dependent on the patient's signs and symptoms. 9 15. Differential diagnosis of alcohol withdrawal is dependent on the patient's history. 9 x x x 16. Clinicians should be aware that a patient with a high blood alcohol level (e.g., 100 -200 mg/DL) can be experiencing alcohol withdrawal. 9 17. The presence of alcohol withdrawal does not exclude co - existing disease, co -occurring substance use disorder, or simultaneous withdrawal from other substances. 9 x x x 148 APPENDICES 18. Do not rule in or out a co -occurring disease, co -occurring mental health disorder, co -occurring substance use disorder, or simultaneous withdrawal from other substances even in the presence of alcohol withdrawal. 8.5 19. For patients experiencing new onse t seizures or for patients with a known history of alcohol withdrawal seizures showing a new pattern, an EEG and/or neuroimaging is recommended 7 x x x 20. For patients with a known history of alcohol withdrawal seizure who present with a seizure that can be attributed withdrawal, additional neurological testing may not be necessary. 8 x x x 21. For patients with a known history of alcohol withdrawal seizure who present with a seizure that can be attributed to withdrawal, a neurology consult may not be necessary. 7.5 x x x 22. If a patient has a known history of withdrawal seizures, and the current seizure can be attributed to withdrawal, a full evaluation and additional testing may not be necessary. This includes if the seizure was generalized and without focal elements, if a careful neurological examination reveals no evidence of focal deficits, if there is no suspicion of meningitis and if ther e is no history of recent head trauma a. stroke 7.5 x x x b. Transient ischemic attack (TIA) 7.8 x x x c. Cerebrovascular accident (CVA) 8 x x x 23. Whenever possible in non -emergent situations, obtain consent or a release of information from the patient before: a. speaking to collaterals (e.g., family, friends, caretakers) 8 x x x b. consulting with other health professionals currently caring for a patient 8 x x x 1 Initial Assessment 2 Statements: Initial Assessment Appropriateness (Median) Level of Evidence AMSTAR - 2 AACODS Cochrane ROB 24. The ASSIST can be helpful for characterizing a patient's drug or alcohol use. 9 25. Measuring BAC with a breathalyzer can be helpful for detecting a patient's recent alcohol use. 9 26. Conducting urine drug screens can be helpful for detecting a patient's drug or alcohol use. 9 27. Treatment of a patient with alcohol withdrawal should not be impeded if clinicians don't have breathalyzers or drug tests available. 9 28. Treatment of a patient with alcohol withdrawal should not be delayed because clinicians are waiting for drug test results. 9 29. When practical, obtain a complete blood count with differential, blood glucose, calcium, magnesium, phosphorous, anion gap, and renal and hepatic function tests. 7 Moderate 30. Initial laboratory screening may include testing for viral hepatitis, HIV testing with permission, pregnancy testing and a tuberculin skin test. 8 31.

Treatment of a patient with alcohol withdrawal should not be delayed because clinicians are waiting for laboratory test results. 9 33. The PHQ -9 can be helpful for identifying a possible psychiatric illness. 7.5 34. The GAD can be helpful for identifying a possible psychiatric illness 8 35. Clinicians should measure the severity of alcohol withdrawal symptoms with a validated instrument such as the CIWA -Ar. 8.5 Moderate 36. A validated instrument should be used to assess the severity of alcohol withdrawal. The Richmond Agitation -Sedation scale (RASS) can be helpful. 5 x x x 37. For patients who are able to monitor and score their own symptoms, the SAWS, a validated instrument designed for self-administration, may be used. 7 Moderate 38. Clinically, the most important information for clinicians to know is whether the patient will develop potentially life - threatening symptoms. 8 39. Symptoms may indicate risk, but they are not the sole indication. 8 40. To assess patients for risk of complicated withdrawal, clinicians should use the results of an existing tool combined with an assessment of individual risk factors. 8 41. Clinicians can determine risk of complicated withdrawal by interviewing family members about the patient's history of alcohol withdrawal, seizures, and delirium. 7 Moderate 42. One common error when using a withdrawal risk assessment tool is to assess the patient who is clinically intoxicated, which may result in a high withdrawal score and thus lead to treatment of an already intoxicated individual with benzodiazepines. 6* Moderate 43. The CIWA -Ar should only be used to measure withdrawal symptoms and indicate risk of complicated withdrawal once the patient has been diagnosed with or is assumed to have alcohol withdrawal. 7.5 44. Although a high score can indicate high risk, the CIWA -Ar should not be the only information used to predict a patient's risk of complicated withdrawal. 8 High 45. There are a variety of recommendations about the use of CIWA -Ar score to indicate risk of complicated withdrawal. In general, patients with CIWA -Ar scores greater than 15 -19 may be considered at risk of complicated withdra wal. 8 Moderate 46. There are a variety of recommendations about the use of CIWA -Ar scores to indicate risk of complicated withdrawal. In general, patients with CIWA -Ar scores lower than 8 -10 may be considered at low risk of complicated withdrawal. 6* Low 47. If the score on the CIWA -Ar is low over the first 24 hours without need for or administration of cross -tolerant medications, there is little or no risk of severe withdrawal subsequently. 6.5* Low 48. Clinicians can consider the use of a tool to determine patient risk for alcohol withdrawal such as the ASAM Risk Matrix. 8 Low 150 APPENDICES Statements: Initial Assessment Appropriateness (Median) Level of Evidence AMSTAR - 2 AACODS Cochrane ROB 49. Among hospitalized patients, the PAWSS can be a helpful tool to assess for the risk of alcohol withdrawal in the absence of signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. 8 Moderate 50. Among hospitalized patients, the AUDIT -PC can be a helpful tool to assess for the risk of alcohol withdrawal in the absence of signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. 7 Low 51. Among hospitalized patients, the LARS (Luebeck Alcohol - withdrawal Risk Scale) can be a helpful tool to assess for the risk of alcohol withdrawal. 7 x x x 52. Among hospitalized patients, the Newcastle AWS scale can be a helpful tool to assess for the risk of alcohol withdrawal. 7 Low 53. Among hospitalized patients, the Fast Alcohol Screening Test (FAST) can be a helpful tool to assess for the risk of alcohol withdrawal. 6* Low 54. Some withdrawal risk assessment scales (e.g. the LARS) rely more on objective signs of withdrawal (autonomic a ctivity) and history that may be found in a patient's chart. Consider the use of these scales if the patient cannot communicate and therefore cannot complete a CIWA -Ar. 8 55. Existing scales that rely more on objective signs of withdrawal (autonomic activity) and are appropriate to use include a. Richmond Agitation -Sedation scale (RASS) 7.5 x x x b. Newcastle AWS (has pulse, temp, RR) 6.5 x x x 56. Clinicians should seek information about the time elapsed since the patient's last alcohol use because knowledge of the timeline for symptom onset and severity helps predict withdrawal complications. For example, the period of seizure risk is 6 -48 hours after the reduction or cessation of alcohol use. 8 Low 57. The following individual factors may increase a patient's risk for complicated withdrawal or complications of withdrawal: a. Increasing age 7.5 Low Moderate b. Comorbid medical or surgical illness 8.5 Low Moderate c. Past history of delirium or alcohol withdrawal seizure 9 Moderate Moderate d.

A strong predictor of an incidence of delirium or seizure is the occurrence of a seizure during the current withdrawal episode. 7.5 62. All patients with alcohol withdrawal should receive a history and physical examination as part of the comprehensive assessment process. Clinicians should conduct this examination themselves or, in acco rdance with the ASAM Standards, ensure that a current physical examination is contained within the patient medical record. 9 Low 63. Patients should be screened for common chronic conditions that are associated with alcohol use disorders. 9 64. Patients should be screened for medical conditions that could affect the course of alcohol withdrawal or treatment of alcohol withdrawal. 9 65. If recent results are not available in a patient's medical record, clinicians should conduct and/or arrange for the following routine laboratory tests: a. Albumin 7.5 b. Electrolytes (and calculation of the anion gap) 8 c. INR 7 d. Phosphorus 7.5 e. Magnesium 8 f. Complete blood count (platelets, white blood cell count, hemoglobin) 7 g. Calcium 7.5 h. Glucose 8 i.

Level of care considerations should be based on the patient's level of risk for developing complicated withdrawal and/or complications of withdrawal and current signs and symptoms. 9 71. Although a high CIWA -Ar score is an indication that a patient is at high risk for complicated withdrawal, clinicians should be aware that the CIWA -Ar has only been validate d for tracking the withdrawal management process and not for making level of care decisions. 8 Low 72. Patients who are at low risk for severe withdrawal syndrome can be treated in an outpatient setting. 9 Low 73. Patients with risk factors for severe or complicated withdrawal should be treated in a medical setting with 24 -hour nursing care. 9 Low 74.

Some studies have shown that the adjunctive use of anticonvulsants reduces the total dose of benzodiazepines. However, the total dose of benzo diazepine is not a meaningful clinical goal in its own right, or a good measure of the efficacy of anticonvulsants to reduce and prevent alcohol withdrawal symptoms. 8 308.

For patients at risk for pre -term delivery, use of a short -acting benzodiazepine is recommended in the late third trimester, given their short onset and offset of action, which minimize the risk for neonatal benzodiazepine intoxication. 7.5 495. Use of chlordia zepoxide is recommended in the first trimester of pregnancy as the preponderance of evidence points to low teratogenic risk. 5 496. Because anticonvulsants carry a risk of neural tube defects in addition to teratogenic risks, clinicians should ensure that pregnant patients take folic acid if they are being treated for alcohol withdrawal using anticonvulsants. 6 497.
