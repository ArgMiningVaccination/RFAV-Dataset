We have natural waste management systems where waste is eliminated via our breath, urine, sweat and faeces. We filter the air we breathe, the food and drink we consume, and anything we absorb through our skin. Our blood circulation, digestive tract, liver, kidneys and lungs are all brilliant systems that operate efficiently and effectively in the right conditions. The sheer number we of toxins we are exposed to on a daily basis however can cause strain on our organs and assistance may be required to flush them out of our system. Traditional Chinese Medicine has been helping people get rid of pathogens for over 2000 years, but the world has changed drastically since its inception. From the chemical cleaners, industrial pollutants, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and even our food, our bodies now encounter hundreds of potential toxins each and every day. Common symptoms that show your body needs to detox are general body aches and pains, unexplained fatigue, skin rashes, digestive problems, frequent colds, depression and mood changes, sinus congestion, bags under eyes and more. In Traditional Chinese medicine detoxification is about resting, cleaning and nourishing the body from the inside out. Chinese medicine recognises the body's innate healing systems as being paramount and aims to assist in creating an environment of balance and harmony to assist the body in its self healing abilities. Removing and eliminating toxins and then feeding your body with healthy nutrients after detoxification can protect you from diseases and renew your ability to maintain optimum health. Chinese medicine can help the body's natural cleansing process by: Resting the organs Stimulating the liver to drive toxins from the body Promoting elimination through intestines, kidneys and skin Improving circulation of the blood Re-fuelling the body with healthy nutrients Treatments Chinese Medicine offers treatments such as [acupuncture](https://www.carecureacupuncture.com/acupuncture-1), [acupressure](https://www.carecureacupuncture.com/acupressure-massage), [cupping](https://www.carecureacupuncture.com/cupping), [herbs](https://www.carecureacupuncture.com/post/treatment-with-chinese-herbs) and [dietary therapy](https://www.carecureacupuncture.com/fire-dragon-moxibustion) to help invigorate stagnant blood, improve circulation, strengthen the organs, re-balance your regulatory system and re-balance hormones.
