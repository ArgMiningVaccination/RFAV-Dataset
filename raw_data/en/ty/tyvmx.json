Acupuncture not only improves circulation to the uterus and ovaries, but may also help provide the developing embryo a safe, comfortable place to attach inside the uterus to receive nourishment and keep growing (5). Reduces feelings of stress & anxiety One of the most common reasons people seek out acupuncture is to manage the effects of stress and anxiety. What many couples don't realize, however, is that stress-related symptoms like headaches, trouble sleeping, or pain can often be signs that stress is also negatively impacting fertility. Acupuncture sessions help calm the nervous system and shift energy toward reproduction and conception.

Studies have found that some markers of sperm quality improved significantly in men who received acupuncture treatments, with higher concentrations of healthy, motile sperm cells (6). The process is believed to work in a similar way as it does for women, with acupuncture helping to reduce stress and improve circulation in the reproductive organs. While more research is needed on this topic, initial studies suggest that acupuncture can be an effective tool for couples looking to conceive by addressing male infertility issues.

In the case of one woman diagnosed with endometriosis, acupuncture resolved the cysts on her ovaries and resulted in a successful pregnancy (7). In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), ovarian cysts can occur because of stagnation in the Liver Qi. If this function is weakened, then the immune system can be disturbed, and abnormal immune reactions may be triggered by the growth of abnormal tissue in the female reproductive organs. The points used in the treatment were chosen with the aim to help the patients to [improve the energy flow to the reproductive organs](https://centrespringmd.com/chinese-medicine-approach-fertility/), and remove the blockages that cause stagnation in the flow. Reduces Inflammation [Chronic inflammation](https://centrespringmd.com/warning-signs-of-chronic-inflammation/) is a growing factor underlying infertility. Acupuncture is believed to reduce inflammation by stimulating the body's natural feel-good hormones and reducing the level of stress hormones like cortisol (8). It may also upregulate the expression of GABA receptors, further helping with the inflammatory effects of things like stress. Acupuncture also reduces levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increases expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines, both markers for inflammation (9). There are many things that contribute to inflammation, including lifestyle factors such as a poor diet, [high toxic burden](https://centrespringmd.com/toxic-overload-can-cause-infertility/), stress, and inadequate sleep. Hormone conditions like endometriosis or PCOS can also increase inflammation and make it harder to become pregnant. This is why following an [anti-inflammatory diet](https://centrespringmd.com/top-5-anti-inflammatory-foods-anti-inflammatory-diet/) and taking steps to reduce overall inflammation can be helpful if you're struggling with fertility. Who is acupuncture right for? Acupuncture is beneficial for couples experiencing fertility struggles, especially when also dealing with hormonal imbalances, unexplained fertility, PCOS, or endometriosis. Patients are commonly treated for 3 to 4 months before beginning fertility treatments like IVF or IUI. Working with an acupuncturist who can help you bring balance back to your body and help you understand the underlying causes that may be negatively impacting your fertility.
