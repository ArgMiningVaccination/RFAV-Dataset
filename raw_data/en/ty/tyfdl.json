In the hurried pace of modern life, you might take your immune system for granted. Working quietly in the background, your immune system protects you from bacteria, viruses and other microbes and, when treated right, wards off disease. It's a complex network of organs and cells \u2014 one affected for better or worse by what you eat, drink, think and do. Part of my job as a specialist in physical and rehabilitative medicine at the UCI Health [Susan Samueli Integrative Health Institute](/medical-services/susan-samueli-integrative-health-institute) is to help women improve their immune function, overcome chronic infections and treat autoimmune disorders. How to strengthen your immune system Here are seven great ways to super-charge your immunity: Improve your gut health Your gastrointestinal (GI) tract makes up a large part of your immune system \u2014 up to 70 percent of your immune cells live along its path. The lining of your intestines, for example, secretes antibodies and contains cells that recognize and destroy harmful bacteria. Your gut also has both good and bad bacteria that can work for you \u2014 by synthesizing vitamins \u2014 or against you, by triggering an autoimmune response or even disease.

Check your vitamin levels - Vitamin D is probably the most important vitamin related to your immune health. People who get chronic infections have low levels of this vitamin. I recommend supplementing with 2,000 IU to 5,000 IU daily. Ask your doctor to check your levels to determine the amount you need. - Vitamin C has been shown to be useful in people under [increased physical stress](/blog/2017/09/how-to-meditate), to decrease the risk of developing the common cold by half. In the regular population, regular intake of vitamin C may help to decrease the duration of the common cold. Supplement with 1,000 mg to 5,000 mg daily, depending on your personal needs. Nourish your immune system by eating leafy greens and whole foods rich in antioxidants. Eat these power foods - Aim for a balanced diet of whole, unprocessed foods that contain plenty of antioxidants. - Be sure to include four to [five servings of greens](/blog/2017/04/asian-chopped-salad), such as lettuces, mustard and collard greens. - Get plenty of [mushrooms](/blog/2016/04/roasted-asparagus-mushrooms-with-rosemary). Not only are mushrooms a great source of immune-boosting vitamin D (see above), but studies also show that varieties such as maitake and reishi can boost white blood cell activity. - Add plenty of garlic. When crushed, garlic releases allicin, a compound that fights infection-causing microbes.

Progesterone helps to balance estrogen and its effects throughout your body \u2014 especially on the breasts, uterus and brain. Have your hormone levels checked and work with your doctor to achieve an optimal balance. Regular cardio has benefits beyond giving you a stronger heart. Get moving Do some type of [cardio exercise](/blog/2016/12/exercise-healthy-heart) five days a week, 30 to 40 minutes per day. This helps to circulate your blood and improve the flow of lymphatic fluid. Lymphatic fluid travels through your cells and tissues and removes bacteria, toxins, waste products and even cancer cells.

Plus, we usually end up taking care of other people more than we take care of ourselves. This creates chronic stress levels, which decrease the supply of killer immune cells that help our bodies fight infection. Manage stress through [mindfulness training](http://sscim.uci.edu/Education/index.asp), which can help you [gain new perspective on the stressors in your life](/blog/2018/05/anxiety) so they are not so debilitating.

Get adequate sleep Try to sleep at least seven to eight hours each night. Insufficient sleep increases inflammation and lowers your ability to fight infection. If you're having trouble falling \u2014 or staying \u2014 asleep, talk with your doctor about possible hormonal imbalances. You can also try taking melatonin or valerian root prior to bedtime to improve your sleep quality. [How to get a better night's rest ](/blog/2017/02/getting-enough-sleep) Related stories "}
