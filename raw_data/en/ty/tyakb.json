Photo: eadem.co Eadem is a skincare brand that's not yet a year old, but has already made headlines for its signature product created by women of color, for women of color. It launched in the summer of 2021 with a single dark spot serum known for selling out and racking up waitlists, and it (finally!) released a second product: a brightening moisturizer. After testing out Eadem's first product, I couldn't wait to try the new face cream and accepted a sample offered by the brand. The Cloud Cushion moisturizer is, as its name suggests, lightweight and about as fluffy as a skincare cream can get. It's fragrance-free and absorbs easily into the skin. I've been using it on my normal-to-dry, olive-toned skin morning and night for a few weeks, and I notice an instant boost of brightness and hydration with each dollop. This isn't surprising knowing the work that went into creating this effective product. Like the milky serum that came before it, the moisturizer was formulated by women of color chemists, approved by women of color dermatologists, and tested on different skin shades. It's what the brand calls \"Smart Melanin Beauty.\" And while it was designed with darker skin tones in mind, it's made for all. 50 Black-Owned Beauty Brands to Support Now and Always This product protects, hydrates, and nourishes skin with help from both natural and synthetic ingredients. Ceramides, glycerin, and tucuma extract (a plant-derived emollient) protect and restore the skin barrier, fading acne scars and preventing water loss. Squalane and snow mushroom\u2014an ingredient found in Traditional Chinese Medicine that's more hydrating than hyaluronic acid, according to Eadem's site\u2014boost moisture without clogging pores. It also contains chamomile and black seed extract, both of which have anti-inflammatory properties that soothe the skin. Finally, niacinamide prevents acne and improves skin texture, while tetrapeptide-30 (a four-amino acid peptide) fades hyperpigmentation and skin discoloration. If you're not sold by all of the powerful ingredients or my personal experience with the moisturizer, a look at the new product's customer reviews may convince you to give it a try. Shoppers with a variety of skin types and tones have left positive feedback, including one who said, \"my skin feels like it has finally found itself.\" Multiple users confirm it moisturizes and brightens skin, and some reported noticing dark spots even out and acne calm down. You can order the moisturizer from Eadem's site and Sephora to give it a try. eadem.co To buy: $58; eadem.co and sephora.com Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Tell us why!
