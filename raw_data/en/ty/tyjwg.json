Among them, four have been put under the Variants Of Concern (VOC) category and another four have been placed under the Variants Of Interest (VOI), while three are for further monitoring. Variants are expected from viruses including SARS-CoV-2. While most changes have little to no impact on the virus' properties, some of them are closely being watched as they could affect the virus' transmission rate, the severity of the disease, performance of the vaccines and therapeutic medicines, and social measures. To further assess these mutations, the WHO has convened a group of scientists from the WHO Virus Evolution Working Group and representatives from the [GISAID](https://www.gisaid.org/) Initiative who can classify and put labels on the variants.

Variants under this classification are Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta. Variants Of Interest (VOI) A SARS-CoV-2 falls under [VOI](https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/) if it has: - Genetic changes that are predicted or known to affect virus characteristics such as transmissibility, disease severity, immune escape, diagnostic or therapeutic escape OR - Identified to cause significant community transmission or multiple COVID-19 clusters, in multiple countries with increasing relative prevalence alongside an increasing number of cases over time, or other apparent epidemiological impacts to suggest an emerging risk to global public health. Strains under this classification are Eta, Iota, Kappa, and Lambda.
