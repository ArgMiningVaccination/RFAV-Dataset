Tilford Copyright: 2009 page contains affiliate links. [Get details](#affiliate). Simply because a particular herb can be beneficial to humans does not make it safe or suitable to use for our pets. I haven't yet had a chance to read this book in its entirety, but I have already found Herbs for Pets to be well worth its price for information regarding particular ailments/issues affecting my feline and senior canine and for looking up particular benefits and warnings/precautions about the use of particular herbs for our furry companions. Chapter 2's Materia Medica spans 160 pages. It includes a primary section that provides detailed profiles for 65 herbs (see below table of contents for a list) and shorter profiles for 44 more. The profiles include color photographs of most of the fresh botanicals. The detailed profiles include these sections (I didn't check every single one -- some herbs may not contain all sections): - Common Name - Botanical Name - Family Name - Appearance - Habitat and Range - Cycle and Bloom Season - Parts Used - Primary Medicinal Activities - Strongest Affinities - Preparation - Common Uses - Availability - Propagation and Harvest - Alternatives and Adjuncts - Cautions and Comments The \"Herbal Supplement List\" is a section of 44 shorter herbal profiles in Chapter 2. Each herb in this section includes the following information (some also include color photos and a category that discusses availability of the herb): - Common Name - Botanical Name - Primary Medicinal Activites - Common Uses - Safety/Cautions/Contraindications Table of Contents for Herbs for Pets: The Natural Way to Enhance Your Pet's Life - Acknowledgments - Introduction - Chapter 1: Principles and Practices of Herbalism - Using Herbs Naturally - The Many Faces of Herbal Medicine - A Few Words About Toxicity - When to Take your Pet to the Vet - Basics of Herbal Preparations - The Connection Between Herbs and Diet - Using Nutritive Herbs and Dietary Supplements - The Ethical Use of Herbs - Chapter 2: - Material Medica: An A-Z Guide to Herbs for Animals - Alfalfa - Aloe - Arnica - Astragalus - Bee Balm - Black Walnut - Borage - Bugleweed - Burdock - Calendula - Catnip - Chickweed - Cleavers - Coltsfoot - Comfrey - Corn Silk - Couch Grass - Dandelion - Dill - Echinacea - Elecampane - Fennel - Feverfew - Flax - - - - Gotu Kola - Gravelroot Grindelia - Hawthorn - Hop - Horsetail - Juniper - Lavender - Licorice - Marshmallow - Milk Thistle - Mullein - Nettle - Oat - Oregon Grape - Oxeye Daisy - Parsley - Plantain - Raspberry - Red Clover - Rose - Rosemary - Sage - Saint-John's Wort - Shepherd's Purse - Skullcap - Slippery Elm - Thyme - Uva Ursi - Valerian - Wormwood - Yarrow - Yellow Dock - Yucca - Supplemental Herb List - Ashwaganda - Bilberry - Blue Cohosh - Caraway Cascara - - Coriander - Cranberry - Devil's Claw - Eyebright - Evening Primrose - Eucalyptus - Fenugreek - Fleabane - Gentian - Ginger - Ginseng - Kava Kava - Kelp - Lemon Balm - Lobelia - Lovage - Meadowsweet - Myrrh - Oregano - Passionflower - Pennyroyal - Peppermint - Pineapple Weed - Pipsissewa - Saw Palmetto - Senna - Siberian Ginseng - Spirulina - Turkey Rhubarb - Turmeric - Usnea - Vervain - White Oak Bark - Wild Cherry Bark - Willow - Witch Hazel - Chapter 3: An Herbal Repertory for Animals: Ailments and Treatments - Anxiety, Nervousness, and Behavioral Problems - Arthritis and Hip Dysplasia - Cancer - Cardiovascular Problems - Digestive System Problems - Ear Problems - Elderly Animal Care - Endocrine System and Related Problems - Epilepsy, Convulsions, and Seizures - Eye Problems - First Aid - Immune System Care - Mouth and Nose Problems - Parasite-Related Problems: How to Live with Fleas, Worms, Mites, and Other Things That Suck - Pregnancy and Lactation - Respiratory Problems - Skin Problems - Urinary Problems - Glossary - References - Index Amazon.com typically offers this book for the lowest price around.
