IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF INULIN 1 Abstract Beneficial effects of inulin -type fructans are discussed in view of studies that applied the oligosaccharides in colon cancer, chronic inflammatory diseases, vaccination efficacy, and prevention of infection and allergy. In this chapter, we discuss their immunomodulating effects. It is suggested that immunomodulation is elicited through indirect and direct mechanisms. Indirect mechanisms encompass stimulation of growth and activity of lactic acid bacteria, but can also be caused by fermentation products of these bacteria, i.e., short chain fatty ac ids. Evidence for direct effects on the immune system generally remains to be confirmed. It is suggested that inulin -type fructans can be detected by gut dendritic cells (DCs), through receptor ligation of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll -like receptors, nucleotide oligomerization domain containing proteins (NODs), C -type lectin receptors, and galectins, eventually inducing pro - and anti -inflammatory cytokines. DCs may also exert antigen presenting capacity toward effector cells, such as B cells, T cells, and natural killer cells locally, or in the spleen. Inulin -type fructans may also ligate PRRs expressed on gut which could influence its barrier function. Inulin -type fructans are potent immunomodulating food components that ho ld many promises for prevention of disease. From this literature review, we conclude that studies into the mechanisms, dose - effect relations, and structure -function studies are warranted. Inulin -type fructans from chicory can then be applied as model fiber s to establish a technology platform for testing dietary fibers in primary cells and cell line models, and finally to test the application in human studies. CHAPTER 1. IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS. 2 Introduction 1.1 Functional food fibers in the context of society The scientific and industrial functional food worlds are meeting some new challenges. The consumer awareness that food is not only required to supply energy and nutrition, but also that healthy food is essential for prevention of disease and for both physi cal and mental well -being is growing [1-3]. This causes an increased demand for functional foods. A major category of functional foods is that of dietary fibers and prebiotic fibers. One of the root vegetables which is specifically cultured for its high content of prebiotic inulin -type occurring linear plant and polysaccharides which consist of minimally two one (2-1) fructosyl glycosydic bond [4]. It is a family of molecul es which meet the three classification criteria for being considered a prebiotic, as defined by Gibson and Roberfroid [5]; i.e. resistance to hydrolysis or absorption in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, fermenta tion by the intestinal microbiota, and selective stimulation of the growth and/or activity of beneficial intestinal bacteria, such as Lactobacillus species and Bifidobacterium species. Well -known effects of inulin -type fructans on the gut microbiota are th e increase in numbers of these types of bacteria in the intestinal tract, and the selective fermentation of inulin -type fructans by most Bifidobacterium species [6], and by some Lactobacillus species [7]. For a considerable period of time, research has mainly been focused on the prebiotic, i.e. indirect effects of inulin -type fructans [8-12]. Somewhat more recent is prebiotic carbohydrates such as inulin -type fructans may elicit additional, direct effects such as immunomodulation along the GI tract [5,8,11,13,14] . This may occur via direct contact with gut dendritic cells (DCs) which sample immune active components from the gut lumen, and with intraepithelial lymphocyte s (IELs) which can respond immediately upon contact with immune active food components [14-16]. It is also conceivable that contact of inulin -type fructans with the gut epit helial cells modulates the innate immune barrier by modifying epithelial tight junction integrity, or alters the signals from epithelial cells to the underlying immune cells [17]. In addition, the glycosidic and non -glycosidic fermentation products produced by gut CHAPTER 1. IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS. 3 microbiota upon fiber supplementation are under investigation for their beneficial health effects as reviewed by Meijer et al. [18] and Macfarlane and Macfarlane [19]. The glycosidic fermentation products can be small sized oligosaccharides and the non -glycosidic fermentation products include SCFAs such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate [20,21] . Although there are some recent on the immunomodulatory properties of inulin -type fructans [22-24], in the majority of these reviews, immunomodula tion was mainly discussed as an integral part of the health benefits of prebiotic fibers [11,25 -28]. Many studies demonstrate that inuli n-type fructans have unique ways for immunomodulation, but the underlying mechanisms are still incompletely understood. The following section provides an overview of the current knowledge of the direct and indirect mechanisms of immune modulation by inuli n-type fructans and the possible signaling pathways. This overview is focused on the beneficial effects of inulin -type fructan supplementation in several diseases including colon cancer, , chronic inflammatory diseases [32-36], vaccination efficacy [37,38,38 -43], and prevention of infection and allergy [8,39,44 -50]. 1.2 Structure and terminology of inulin -type discussing the immunomodulating properties of inulin -type fructans it is mandatory to discuss the structure and terminology of these molecules since their structure or more specifically their chain length probably determines their function in the ho st. Several studies have indicated that polymer chain length or degree of polymerization (DP), is an important feature to consider, as it determines where along the GI tract fermentation occurs [9,51,52] . It appears that short chain fructans are generally fermented relatively fast in the proximal colon, whereas fructans with a relatively long chain resist fermentation until they reach the distal colon where they are metabo lized [10,17] . In addition, Bifidobacterium species differ along the gastrointestinal tract, so the different DP can determine the types of bacteria that become enriched. This could render different outcomes in health related parameters [9]. Fructans are denoted as Fn, with F for fructose and n representing the number of fructose subunits in the polymer. Most inulin -type fructans in nature contain a termin al glucose residue (denoted as a GFn) as biosynthesis starts with sucrose to which fructose residues are added [4]. Figure 1 depicts Haworth projections of these two types of fructans. When CHAPTER 1. IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS. 4 Figure 1. Haworth projections of fructan molecules. Left projection depicts an inulin -type fructan of the GFn type, right projection depicts inulin -type fructan of the Fn type. the fructan chain starts with a glucose molecule, this glucose can be removed from the chain by hydrolyzing sucrase enzymes, which are produced at the tips of the small intestinal epithelial villi [53]. Based on chain le ngth, inulin -type fructans are usually rather arbitrarily divided in subcategories with a relatively small (2 to 4), medium (5 to 10) and relatively large chain length (11 to 60 fructose units). Over the course of time the nomenclature to describe inulin -type prebiotics has been inconsistent. Historically, the term fructooligosaccharides or FOS was used for DP 3 -5 material derived from sucrose which is thereby only of the GFn type [54]. The term oligofructose or OF w as used for DP3 -10 material derived from native inulin which can be of both the GFn and the Fn type [55]. Later, FOS and OF were and are more and more used as synonyms to describe fructans with a chain length ran ging between 2 and 10 subunits [56]. To discriminate, the term short chain FOS (sc -FOS) was used by the company producing this ingredient (Actilight\u00ae, Eridania -Beghin Say, Belgium), [57]. Some companies use the term long chain FOS (lc -FOS) or OF (lc -OF) for the long chain inulin that is part of a specific galactooligosaccharide (GOS)/inulin mixture. The term inulin is often applied to inulin -type fructans with chain lengths above 1 0 CHAPTER 1. IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS. 5 Figure 2. Chain length distribution examples of inulin -type fructans for FOS, FOS -enriched inulin, and high average molecular weight inulin. however, inulin is the generic term describing all (2,1) -fructans without specification of chain length [4,11] . Here we will apply the term FOS for inulin -type fructans of 2 to 10 subunits and we will use the term inulin for inulin -type fructans wit h chain lengths above 10 subunits. Chain length is specified where possible to render an overview of the properties of these specific compounds. Figure 2 depicts chain length profiles as an example for a FOS, a FOS -enriched inulin and a high average molecu lar weight inulin. 1.3 The gastrointestinal immune barrier and inulin -type fructans Many of the studies addressing immunomodulating effects of inulin -type fructans have focused on the Gut Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT, Figure 3 ). Constituents of this t issue are the lamina propria, Peyer's patches with follicles containing B and T lymphocytes, isolated lymph nodes, mesenteric lymph nodes, and the appendix [58]. Important players in this system are follicle associated Microfold cells (M cells), which are part of the epithelial layer covering the Peyer's patches, and are specialized in transporting antigens from the lumen to the and intraepitheli al lymphocytes (IELs) lie in between and just below the epithelial surface. The DCs are capable of sampling and sensing the events in the gut lumen and are strong antigen presenting cells (APCs) [60]. Lamina propria DCs can respond to 1.

Structural proportions were altered for illustrative purposes. penetrated gut tissue beyond the epithelial barrier and are also strong APCs [60]. Depending on the cytokine environment, APCs can determine whether the T cells they encounter and present their antigen to, differentiate into regulatory T lymphocytes (Tr1 or Th3) or into effector (helper) Th2, or ation in the lamina propria or specifically in Peyer's patches or mesenteric lymph [59]. The immunoglobulin (Ig) B lymphocytes in Peyer's patch follicles are plasma -cell precursors that produce I gA. Memory IgA+ B lymphocytes are generated in the germinal centers of these follicles [59,61,62] . IgA is mainly synthesized in response to T -lymphocyte activation and the production is again regulated by the cytokine environment. Interleukin (IL) -5, IL -6, and IL -10 stimulate final differentiation of B lymphocytes into IgA -secreting plasma cells [63]. IgA is the most abundant immunoglo bulin in the intestinal mucosa (80 -90%) and forms the first line of defence against colonization and invasion by pathogens, and against damaging toxins [64]. T lymphocyte 1. IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS. 7 be characterized by the cytokin es they produce. Th1 lymphocytes typically secrete Interferon (IFN) -, IL-2, and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) -, and their main function is phagocyte -mediated defense against viral, bacterial, and protozoic infections. Th2 lymphocytes typically secrete IL -4, IL-5, and IL-13, and act as allergic response mediators and defenders against infections produced by helminths and arthropods [63,65] . Although it is becoming clear that the Th1/Th2 model is too s implistic, the Th model has still played an important part in developing our understanding of the roles and behavior of Th cells and the cytokines they produce during an immune response. Therefore, other subtypes to discuss are Th3 cells, Th5 cells, Th9 cells, Th17 cells, and Th22 cells. Th3 cells produce the cytokine Transforming Growth Factor -beta (TGF -) and IL -10. Both cytokines are inhibitory to Th cells; TGF - suppresses the activity of most of the immune system. Th5 cells constitute a subpopulation of Th cells described by Kurowska -Stolarska et al. [66]. These cells produce mainly IL -5, but not IL - 4, both of which are characteristic type 2 cytokines produced by Th2 cells. Studies by Vel dhoen et al. [67] revealed that another Th subset may exist. Th9 cells are claimed to be an IL -9 producing T cell subset focused on defending helminth infections. These cells have been identified as a unique subset of Th cells and constitute a subset of cells known as neutrophil -regulatory T -cells. They are CD4(+) T -cells that are defined by the production of IL -17. Th17 cells develop from naive T -cells along a pathway that is distinct from the differentiation pathways that give rise to the Th cell populations known as Th1 cells and Th2 cells [68,69] . Th22 cells and -homing CCR4 and CCR10. This subset of IL -22- producing cells is suggested to be important in skin homeostasis and pathology [70]. All these different arms of the gastrointestinal immune barrier can be modulated either indirectly, i.e. via microbiota or directly upon consumption of inulin -type fructans. 1.4 Indirect mechanism of prebiotic effects of inulin -type are often referred to as bifidogenic effects. These bifidogenic effects were shown in infants [50,71 - 74], adults [75-79], and elderly beneficial effect of inulin -type fructans was assumed to be determined by the effects on the commensal microbiota that formed a barrier for pathogens to enter the host. However, its beneficial effect on commensals probably also has an e ffect on prevention of inflammation in the systemic circulation. The CHAPTER 1. IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS. 8 and butyrate [4]. These pr oducts have been studied in relation to beneficial effects and have been reported to protect from colonization by pathogens or non - commensals by acidification of the colonic content [9,51,82] . In addition, they are rapidly adsorbed by the human body [83] and exert their effect on immune cells by binding to activating G protein -coupled receptors (GPR) [84] GPR41 and polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs, e.g. neutrophils) and at lower levels in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (P BMCs) and purified monocytes. GPR41 is similarly expressed in PBMCs but not in PMNs, monocytes and DCs [86]. Both receptors are equally expressed in bone marrow and spleen. The possible immunomodulatory functions of S CFAs are highlighted by a study in GPR43 -/- mice [87]. These mice suffer more from inflammation due to lack of GRP43 binding by SCFA, which normally results in anti -inflammatory effects [18]. In these mice, production of inflammatory mediators and immune cell recruitment are increased. These results suggest an immunoregulatory effect for SCFA -mediated GPR43 signaling. More studies are required to confirm whether inulin -type fructan supplementation and subsequent SCFA production actually affects these receptors, but as it has a strong effect on SCFA producing bacteria it is very likely a mechanism by which inulin -type fructans exert their immunomodulatory effect [88]. The intraindividual bifidogenic effect can differ in outcome depending on the initial level of bifidobacteria, and may also differ between individual Bifidobacterium species [9]. Although in general this prebiotic effect is present [73,75,76,79,89] there are inconsistencies in prebiotic properties of inulin -type fructans throughout literature [4]. These should probably be explained by differences in the applied type i.e. chain length of fructan, the dose, the study population, the duration of supplementation, and the time inter vals for microbiological analysis The digestible mono -, and dimers of fructose or glucose which are present in most prebiotics may also influence the bacterial composition upon supplementation. Minor data are available on possible differences in effects of chain length of inulin -type fructans on prebiotic effects, besides the fact that short chain fructans are fermented by more Bifidobacterium species compared to long chain fructans [90]. CHAPTER 1. IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS. 9 1.5 Direct mechanisms of immunomodulation: ligation of Pattern Recognition Receptors To be able to distinguish the good from the bad, the gut immune system is equipped with pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs). These PRRs recognize molecular structures that are highly conserved and broadly shared by pathogens, known as pathogen -associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) the well -like - bound C -type lectin receptors (CLRs), cytosolic proteins such as NOD -like receptors (NLRs) and RIG -I-like receptors (RLRs), and still to be discovered PRRs that mediate sensing of cytoso lic DNA or retrovirus infection [92-94]. Upon PAMP recognition, PRRs initiate signaling processes that may lead to cytokine release, inflammation, and clearance of the pathogen as a final goal. Possible direct effects of inulin -type fructans are thought to entail ligation of PRRs on the surface of gut DCs which continuously sample the gut content and are strong APCs [60]. Potential receptors i nvolved are TLRs [95]. TLRs are involved in epithelial cell proliferation, secretion of IgA into the gut lumen and expression of antimicrobial peptides, which are crucial factors for maintaining a healthy epithelial barrier [96,97] . They are typically known to possess carbohydrate binding properties and upon ligation will instigate several immune responses. For the same reasons, CLRs, NLRs, and galectins are also potentially involved in inulin -type fructan signaling [95]. Besides DCs, many cell types express TLRs, including epithelial cells [96]. It is conceivable arides, inulin -type fructans could ligate TLRs on the gut epithelial cells and thereby modulate barrier function by promoting tight junction stability, similar to the mechanism reported by Karczewski et al. [98]. In addition, the activation of epithelial TLRs could alter their interactions with or signals towards surrounding immune cells such as DCs or IELs [16]. Finally, inulin -type fructans may possess the capacity of interac ting with cell membrane lipids or even inserting in the membrane [99]. Vereyken et al. [100 -102] found that there was a chain length -dependent interaction of inulin with lipids, and that inulin -type fructans can actually interact with or even insert into membrane lipid bilayers [100 -102] . Th is could have a consequence for stimulating events; if insertion renders the membrane more fluid and more dynamic this may facilitate or enhance receptor clustering and subsequent signal transduction. Notably, this may be more or only relevant for sites w here the mucus layer is relatively thin i.e. the small bowel [103] , so fructans can CHAPTER 1. IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS. 10 reach the cells relatively easily as compared to the large bowel, where the mucus layer is considerably thicker. It should be not ed that most hypotheses on direct ligation of inulin -type fructans or their direct contact with epithelial structures remain to be investigated and are at this point still only speculative . 1.6 Experimental evidence for immunomodulation Many supplementation studies with inulin -type fructans were performed in healthy experimental animal models. Some studies apply inulin -type fructans only in a synbiotic treatment, i.e. in combination with a probiotic, limiting the possibility to evaluate the ac tual fructan effects. The features reported most frequently in healthy experimental animals are increased IgA secretion in serum and fecal samples, and increased IL -10 and IFN - production in two specific structures of the GALT; the mesenteric lymph nodes and the Peyer's patches [104 -107] (Table 1 ). Inconsistency in results are present for IgA in ileum, serum, and feces [104 -106,108,109] . The IgA production increased or not affected [104 -106,108,109] , the number of lymphocytes in the blood was increased or unaltered [64,106,107,110,111] , and the number of lymphocytes or subsets in the spleen and thymus were increased or unaltered [51,64,72,112] . In a single study in sea bream, inulin -type fructan supplementation in lymphocytes [113] . However, in a study in salmon, supplementation with 7,5% inulin did not protect against soybean meal -induced colitis [114] . Evidence for immunomodulation on a genetic level was reported by Yasuda et al . [115] in a 7 week supplementation study in pigs. Inulin -type fructans were added to the basal corn and soybean meal, which significantly d ecreased the expression of inflammation related genes, especially in lower gut mucosa. These different reports might be att ributed to differences in the administered type of fructan ( -mixtures) and other differences in experimental set up such as animal species or feeding protocol [116] . More and better designed studies in healthy ex perimental animals and humans are required to determine the specific immunomodulating effects of different inulin -type fructans. Although inulin -type fructan supplementation studies in healthy adult humans have been performed, immunological parameters were unfortunately often not measured. Immunological effects of inulin -type fructans have been studied in infants and elderly, but taking into account their immune status, these groups are to be categorized as immunocompromised, because the microbiota and CHAPTER 1. IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF INULIN -TYPE CHAPTER 1. IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS. 12 immune system of infants is not fully developed and the microbiota composition and immune function decreases qualitatively with age [117] . The only conclusions we can draw from the current supplementation studies i n healthy human adults, studies in healthy experimental animals, as well as studies in infants and elderly, is that inulin -type fructan supplementation in healthy human adults will generally result in increased bifidobacteria numbers in the gut [75-79], increased levels of fecal sIgA [104 -106] , increase d levels of IL -10 and IFN - in Peyer's patches [104 -107] and increased activity of different immune cells in the spleen [39,64,107,108,118] , as these are the parameters which are most often reported to have been changed upon supplementation. The evidence for immunomodulat ion on a systemic level may be somewhat less strong than locally in the gut, however, the local cytokine levels in the gut may have more impact on an immune parameter such as prevention of infections, since the gut is the largest organ of the human body to be in such close contact with the outside world. In the following sections the effects of inulin -type fructans on immune structures are reviewed in the context of the different disease models which have been studied up to now. 1.7 Cancer and cancer ani mal models Two studies using experimental animal cancer models focused on immune parameters involved in anti -tumorigenic reactions. In a study by Roller et al. [119] , the effects of probiotic Lactobacillus LGG and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12, and FOS (\"Raftilose,\" chain length range 2 -10, average 4, 100 g/kg of diet) synbiotic treatment on the immune system of rats were investigated in an azoxymethane (AOM) -induced colon cancer model. responsiveness of lymphocytes in Peyer's patches of AOM -treated rats. It should be noted that no normal diet or placebo diet group was included in this study and that this alteration of responsiveness may be related to the background of the high fat diet. FOS supplementation significantly stimulated IL -10 production in Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes of rats not treated with AOM (p<0.05). In pro - and syn biotic groups, IFN - production in Peyer's patches was significantly decreased independent of AOM treatment (p<0.05). A study by Forest et al . [29] showed that short chain fructans (chain length range DP 1 -4, mostly DP 3) reduced colon tumor incidence in intestinal neoplasia prone \" adenomatous polyposis coli CHAPTER 1. 13 /multiple intestinal neoplasia\" (Apc+/Min) mice via a functional local immune response. Apc is a tumor suppressor gene involved in development of colorectal cancer [120] . In the colons of Apc+/Min mice, FOS treatment restored large intestine -intraepithelial lymphocytes (LI - IELs) surface expression of anti -tumorigenic IL -15/IL -15R. In addition, FOS specifically induced a decr ease in the proportion of CD4+ CD25+ LI -IELs which are considered to be tumor facilitating cells [29]. Publications on fiber supplementation in human cancer patients are rare, and mostly discuss FOS, inulin, or FOS -enriched inulin in supplementation induced secretion of IL -2 and IFN - by PBMCs and decreased bacterial translocation [30,31,121] . Results for immunological parameters in experimental animal cancer models and in human colon cancer patients upon inulin -type fructan supplementation are summarized in Table 2 . Studies regarding tumor growth and outcome of disease upon supplementation with inulin -type fructans have demonstrated anti -carcinogenic properties in multiple experimental animal models [122 -124] and cell lines [125,126] . As previously reviewed by Taper et al . [127] dietary treatment with inulin and/or FOS incorporated in the basal diet for experimental animals: (i) reduced the incidence of mammary tumors induced in Sprague -Dawley rats by methylnitrosourea; (ii) inhibited the growth of transplantable malignant tumors in mice; (iii) decreased the incidence of lung metastases of a malignant tumor implanted intramuscularly in mi ce. Moreover, dietary treatment with inulin and/or FOS (iv) significantly potentiated the effects of cytotoxic drugs and potentiated the effects of radiotherapy on solid form of transplantable lymphoid tumor. Especially the fermentation products of FOS -enriched inulin (\"Synergy1\") i.e. SCFA and deoxycholic acid appear to limit tumor growth [128] . The most consistent findings were reductions in aberrant crypt foci, tumor incidence and metastasis in models which make use of chemically induced pre -neoplastic lesions or tumors in the colon of rats and mice [129-135] . Only one (preliminary) study in patients with colorectal adenomas was performed so far. This study was an open multicenter study on the effects of FOS. No beneficial effect was found on proliferation at the rectal crypts [136] . However, from experimental use of human ex vivo cells, significant anti -carcinogenic effects were reported [137 -141] . Moreover, when applied in a synbiotic CHAPTER 1. IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF INULIN -TYPE OF INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS. 15 protocol, inulin has already shown beneficial effects on inhibition of carcinogenic processes [142] . The prescription of inulin -type fructans to colon/colorectal cancer patients should be applied with some caution, as there are reports that under certain circumstances, inulin -type fructans can actually enhance proliferation of adenomas [142 -144] . It should be noted that these reports involve mice studies and results so far do not show these effects in human colon cancer. The mechanisms behind these effects are not clear and require further investigation. The prod uction and balance of anti - inflammatory and pro -inflammatory/anti -tumorigenic cytokines such as IL - 10 and IL -12 respectively may play a role in these observations because anti-inflammatory cytokines could confer an inhibitory effect on the anti - tumorigenic properties of proinflammatory cytokines. On the other hand, inulin -type fructan supplementation has shown promising anti - tumorigenic properties [29,107] and further investigation into the underlying mechanisms of these processes, which may involve immunomodulation, is warranted. 1.8 Intestinal inflammation in patients and animal models Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a group of inflammatory conditions of the GI tract. IBD is thought to be cau sed by a combination of genetic, environmental, and immunological factors [145] . The current paradigm is that these diseases result from a lack of tolerance to resident intestinal bacteria in genetically susceptible hosts [146 -150] . The major types of IBD are Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC) [151] . CD and UC share similar symptoms but also differ in substantial features. CD can occur along the entire GI tract , whereas UC specifically affects the large intestine or colon. Another difference is that UC occurs more superficially in the gut lining while CD can also affect deeper layers of the intestine, and surrounding tissue. Another affliction of the intestine i s Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS); a functional bowel disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain, discomfort, bloating, and alteration of bowel habits in the absence of any detectable organic cause [152] . Evidence is slowly increasing that inulin -type fructan supplements exert beneficial effects on both bowel movements [80,153 -155] as well as on GI i mmune parameters [33,156] . Supplementation studies have been performed in several animal colitis models as well as in patients with IBD or IBS ( Table 3 and 4). Leenen and Dieleman [157] recently reviewed the effects of pre - and synbiotics on IBD/IBS. Few studies using prebiotics alone have been CHAPTER 1. IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS. 16 performed so far, however results look promising with regard to therapeutic use in treatment of IBD/IBS. FOS-enriched inulin supplementation l owered disease activity scores inflammation marker) [34], disea se (i.e. inflammation scores of endoscopy of the distal colon) were reduced, and endoscopically and histologically verified reductions in inflammation of the mucosa the ileal rese rvoir were observed [33,34] . mRNA levels of beta defensins 2, 3, and 4 (i.e. antimicrobial proteins) were significantly reduced by treatment while these markers are normally upregulated in active UC [159] . When applied in synbiotic set up, increased amounts of bifidobacteria in rectal mucosa were reported, and significant reductions in the expression of molecules that control inflammation in active UC [159] . TNF , and IL -1a mRNA tissue were significantly reduced (p=0.0175 and p=0.0379) but also, a significant increase in IL -10 positive CD11c+ DCs and expression of TLR2 and TLR4 was reported [33]. Beneficial effects in UC patients have been reported [158 -160] as supplementation resulted in improvement of the full clinical appearance of chronic inflammation in patients receiving this therapy. In addition to reduction of intestinal inflammation , regeneration of epithelial tissue was observed. To our knowledge no trials have been conducted as yet to determine whether chronic supplementa tion with inulin -type fructans might ameliorate disease progression, prevent disease recurrence, or sustain periods of clinical remission. Currently available data was gathered in trials aimed at investigating the immediate effects [158 -160] , but it may be worthwhile in future studies to include longer trial periods. Regarding IBD, studies on treatment of chronic intestinal inflammation using inulin -type fructans have shown major benefits in experimental animal models of colitis [35,36,161 -169] (Table 3 ). Several types of experimental animal models exist to mimic IBD; dextran sodium sulfate HLA -B27 transgenic colitis model [165,166] were studied in relation to inulin -type prebiotics. In most of these experimental animal mod els, supplementation rendered statistically significant beneficial effects by reduction of mucosal damage and reduced release of inflammatory mediators such conclusion, inulin -type fructans are promising agents to modulate the immune CHAPTER 1. IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS. 17 parameters involved in colitis. Underlying mechanisms of these effects are however still unclear and warrant more studies on the effects of inulin - type fructans in experimental animal colitis models. Moreover, in IBD patients, long term intervention studies and follow up are required to determine whether inulin -type fructans might have long term beneficial effects in treatment of these diseases. IBS is a common disorder of the GI tract and there is increasing evidence to support the role for immune activation in IBS [173 -177] . In a number of patients the onset is triggered by acute gastroenteritis [178 - 181] . Evidence of sustained immune activation has been found in thes e cases [182] . However, low -grade immune activation without previous acute gastroenteritis can also induce IBS symptoms [183,184] . The immune parameters most often increased in IBS, are IL -6 and IL -8 levels [185,186] and baseline and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced TNF -, IL-1 and IL -6 levels in IBS patients PBMCs [187] . In experimental IBS rat models, increased TLR expression was found in the colonic mucosa of these animals [188,189] . These altered TLR responses may play a significant role in the enhanced immune activity in IBS [190] . The increased risk of developing IBS following gastroenteritis and the co - existence of a disturbed composition of the microbiota, elevated luminal gas production and immu ne activation, indicate that the gastrointestinal microbiota may be a therapeutic target in IBS. There are no recent clinical trials aimed at studying possible immunological benefits of inulin -type fructans in IBS, although previous prebiotic studies indic ate potential health benefit at lower doses, i.e. an intake of 3.5 -5g/day [191] . In the studies of Hunter et al ., and Astegiano et al . [173,174] , only FOS was applied so possible chain length effects have yet to be evaluated. Two other studies incorporated inulin -type fructans in a synbiotic additives) [192,193] . In these synbiotic combinations with inulin, significant reduction in IBS pain symptoms, abdominal diste nsion, and regulation of bowel movement occurred. Moreover, increased stool frequency, reduced abdominal pain and reduced bloating were reported. Olesen et al . [194] reported no beneficial effects in a study with IBS patients who were given chicory derived FOS. Concluding from these results, FOS is a promising agent in IBS therapies when combined with the appropriate probiotics and other cofactors. Future IBS studies including inulin -type 1. IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS. 18 include measurements of the immune parameters mentioned above to evaluate whether based on immunology, inulin -type fructans can provide therapeutic options. 1.9 Systemic immune benefits of inulin type fructan supplementation There are several clear phys iological links between symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and IBD, such as a shared inflammatory cytokine expression pattern and the success of several therapies in both diseases [163,191,195 -197] . This may indicate that where inulin -type fructans might alleviate IBD symptoms, RA patients may equally benefit from such supplementation. Experimental data on the benefits of inulin -type fructans in RA are scarce but studies in an HLA -B27 rat models demonstrated reduced severity of colitis as well as reduced severity of arthritis [165,166] . After inulin -type fructan supplementa tion and pro -inflammatory cytokines was observed [166,191] . In adjuvant -induced arthritis in Wistar rats, and type II collagen -induced arthritis in DB A1 J mice, -GOS supplementation decreased erythema and swelling of limbs, and reduced the histopathological findings in the hind paw joints [198] . In onclusion, supplementation with inulin -type fructans and similar prebiotics such as - GOS as mentioned above, seem to be a promising therapeutic strategy to reduce disease symptoms in experimental animal colitis models and may prove useful in human inflammatory dise ases such as IBD, IBS and RA (Table 3 and 4) [165,166,197] . However, more experimental animal studies are first required to confirm these beneficial effects and their underlying physiological mechanisms [197] . CHAPTER 1. IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF 1. OF CHAPTER 1. OF CHAPTER 1. OF CHAPTER 1. IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS. 23 1.10 Allergy, infection, and immunization The effects of inulin -type fructans on allergies and immunization have been studied extensively in experimental animal models, mostly in combination with GOS administration, but protocols without GOS already show substantial immunological effects, which ar e summarized in Table 5 . Many studies have been performed in pigs, where supplementation with inulin -type fructans mostly shows significant protective effects in infection models [199 -203] . In one study by Milo et al . supplementation of piglets with 1% of inulin for 1 week did not affect immune parameters or infection symptoms upon inoculation with Salmonella t yphimurium . In a study in dogs, inoculated with Salmonella typhimurium DT104, a 14 day supplementation with inulin or FOS (1%) improved food intake and enterocyte sloughing and attenuated fever [32]. Manhart et al. reported that a 16 day supplementation trial with 10% FOS induced an increased CD4+/CD8+ ratio in an experimental mouse model for LPS -induced endotoxemia [204] . Inulin -type fructans have been administered to infant s and children because of their potential to modulate the intestinal microbiota and to benefit the development of an adequate innate and adaptive immune response ( Table 6 ). In healthy infants, the most obvious effect upon supplementation was increased leve ls of IgA in fecal samples, which can protect against pathogens in the gut lumen [45,74,156,205,206] . Saavedra et al. [42] demonstrated an increase in blood IgG levels after measles vaccination in a 10 week supplementation with OF/inulin (7/3, 0,2 g/kg BW/d) in 7 -9 months old infants. However in a study by Duggan et al. [43] in which 6 -12 month old infants were supplemented with OF (0.7g/d), no effect was observed on antibody response after vaccination with H. influenza type B vaccine. Results from these studies may be related to the specifi c pathogen, or the type of fructans used in the vaccine but further studies are required to investigate these differences. In both experimental animal studies and human studies, the use of inulin -type fructans has demonstrated beneficial effects on Th1 as well as on Th2 responses upon vaccination or sensitization protocols. Th1 cells normally drive the cellular immunity pathway to fight viruses and other intracellular pathogens, eliminate cancerous cells, and stimulate delayed - type hypersensitivity (DTH) s kin reactions [48]. Th2 cells drive the humoral immunity pathway and up -regulate antibody production to fight extracellular organisms. In a study by Vos et al. [38] supplementation of mice which were vaccinated with influenza virus, a 9:1 mixture of CHAPTER 1. IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF INULIN -TYPE 24 CHAPTER 1. OF OF FRUCTANS. 26 GOS/FOS enhanced DTH responses dose -dependently, but a mixture of FOS/inulin did not. Fujitani et al. [49] describe anti -allergic effects of FOS in Nc/jic mice upon supplementation with 5% FOS. Schouten et al . [44] demonstrated that a mixture of GOS/FOS inhibited sensitization to orally supplemented whey in mice, but this was only effective when used in synbiotic combination with Bifidobacterium breve. Inulin -type fructans appear to modulate both reactions; timulating the adaptive immune response in a Th1 -direction upon vaccination or sensitization, inhibiting infections [38] or Th -2 related immune disorders such as allergies [37,44,49,207] . In these experimental animal studies, inulin -type fructan effectiveness was most pronounced when used in combination with either GOS or Bifidobacterium breve . On the other hand they can induce increased antibody production (IgA) as part of a Th2 response, increasing clearance of luminal pathogens and re ducing the chance of pathogen tissue entry. Evidence for prevention of allergy incidence or atopic symptoms in infants was reported by Moro et al. [208] , and Arslanoglu et studies inulin -type fructans were only supplemented in combination with GOS. In a study by Raes et al . [206] in which infants received breast milk, formula, or formula supplement ed with GOS/FOS, no clear differences were observed in the investigated immune parameters, but a trend was observed that GOS/FOS supplementation tended to increase blood IgG levels. In conclusion, reduction of incidence of allergic symptoms or protective e ffects on development of allergy upon supplementation with inulin -type fructans have been shown in infants [45,74,156,205,2 06]. For elderly, promising results have been shown for supporting immune function, including protection against respiratory infections [209 -213] (Table 6 ). Other groups of patients which may benefit from inulin -type fructan supplementation by means of Th -1/Th -2 are pregnant women [214] , or burn patients [215] but the small number of supplementation studies performed with these groups show no beneficial effects as yet. In a study in adult male smokers and non -smokers, 4 out of 23 immunological parameters were changed upon su pplementation [216] . However, in the experimental set up of this study, inulin was incorporated in prebiotic bread, which also contained linseed and soy fiber, so observed effects cannot solely be attributed to inulin intake. More studies in healthy CHAPTER 1. IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS. 27 CHAPTER 1. OF CHAPTER 1. OF CHAPTER 1. IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS. 30 human subjects are required to assess the immunomodulatory potential of inulin -type fructans in healthy conditions. 1.11 Possible explanations for the inconsistencies Some of the inconsistencies in the studies focusing on the immunomodulating effects of inulin -type fructans are caused by pertinent differences in study design and the application of different types of inulin - type fructans. In many studies the type of fruc tan has not been clearly documented. In part this can be explained by the inconsistent use of nomenclature regarding chain length. The chain length should always be included as it has been shown that chain length is a determining factor for the beneficial effects [11,131,133,138] . The mechanisms behind this might be that specifically long chain fructans bind to typical receptors in the membrane and cl uster them into membrane microdomains [99] or influence other membrane lipid dynamics [100 -102] whereas the shorter chain fruc tans may lack these properties and exert their effects via different routes. These findings suggest that the chain length of fructans influences the efficacy in modulating immune functions and warrant further investigation [11]. Many of the studies mentioned in this literature overview report altered cytokine levels upon supplementation with inulin -type fructans. Nowadays a lot is known about the effects that cytokines or chemokines have on humans. The connection bet ween inulin ingestion, the production of cytokines or chemokines, and the observed downstream health effects is gradually becoming clearer. On a chemical and cellular level inulin -type fructans can exert several effects and most pronounced effects are obse rved in the GALT. Several studies report modulation [39,105,111,138,206] , and IgA [39,49,106,169,217] levels in serum and/or changes in cytokine [105,107,119,218,219] of spleen NK cells [110,119,140] . IFN - and IL -12 are factors responsible f or Th1 differentiation, whereas IL -4 promotes Th2 subpopulations [48,62] . Regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg) expanded response to IL -10 and IL-10 skews the Th1/Th2 balance to Th2 in vivo by selectively blocking IL -12 synthesis by the antigen -presenting cells such as DCs [62,191] . In addition, IL -4 induces IgA synthesis by follicular B lymphocytes in the Peyer's patches [61]. These B lymphocytes, plasma -cell precursors, will migrate, maturate, and undergo clonal expansion, and finally migrate to the intestinal lamina propria, where they finalize their CHAPTER 1. IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS. 31 maturation into IgA -secreting cells [63]. A great variety of factors can influence this migration, including the cytokines [65] induced by the inulin - type fructans. From this expression pattern of cytokines it appea rs that several types of T cell responses are induced by inulin -type fructans. Because of this complex interplay, and depending on the experimental set up, different outcomes may be observed. 1.12 Future studies with inulin -type fructans There are many biomarkers to quantify immunomodulation in human nutrition intervention studies, but the repercussions of variations in these markers are still unclear, especially in healthy subjects. A review by Albers et al. [25] discusses the suitability of a large panel of biomarkers for the evaluation of nutritional intervention. However, the choice of immune markers needs to be correlated with the particular condition that is being assessed, the relevant clinical en d-points, and whether any immune markers are differentially expressed in disease and control populations [197] . Concluding from the current literature overview, recommended biomarkers, typically suitable for inul in-type fructan supplementation studies are IgG and IgA levels in serum and feces, cytokine expression patterns in the GALT, and NK cell activity in the spleen. Measurements of these markers may be affected by age and gender, and they might vary because of other external confounding factors such as stress, smoking, and alcohol intake [197] . This necessitates careful selection of the control subjects [197] . Patient popula tions which are likely to benefit from inulin - type fructan supplementation include allergic individuals, IBD patients, RA patients and likely also patients suffering from other chronic inflammatory afflictions. Well designed, randomized placebo controlled trials are useful to evaluate possible benefit these patient groups may derive from inulin - type prebiotic supplementation. The physiological effects of ingested inulin -type fructans are likely the combined effects of circumstances including an altered gut microbiota, the presence of produced fermentation products in the gut, and direct effects on gut epithelium and GALT, which complicates the analysis of the induced health effects. To investigate the direct effects, germ free experimental animal models or finely designed SPF experimental animal models and in vitro assays with suitable cell lines may shed more light on the induc ed physiological processes. Specific molecular or cellular effects which are reported repeatedly throughout literature are CHAPTER 1. IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS. 32 important to consider in unraveling the mechanisms behind the observed health benefits and can form a basis for further explorative r esearch. It appears that ingestion of inulin -type fructans affects a spectrum of immune reactions Th1 [30,39,119,121] Th2 NK cell activity [86,110,211] . Depending on the research question, in vitro studies may provide useful information about the typical processes which are induced upon ingestion. In vitro studies into the signaling capacity of inulin -type fructans could entail the use of NK cell activi ty reporter assays. Another signaling target could be B cell activation; Peyer's patch DCs are able to induce B cell maturation and IgA production under influence of intestinal bacteria, via Peyer's patch DC derived cytokines such as B -cell activating fact or (BAFF) and A Proliferation -Inducing Ligand (APRIL) [221,222] . It is possible that inulin - type fructans exert the same effect. Another possibility of promoted IgA production under influence of i nulin -type fructans could be due to the traditional activation of T cells in the Peyer's patch follicles by DCs which have sampled the intestinal lumen and have encountered inulin molecules, followed by T helper cell -mediated B cell maturation and IgA prod uction. Finally, it would be interesting to see whether direct ligation of B cell TLRs [221,223,224] by inulin -type fructans could result in IgA red cytokine levels in inulin -type fructan supplementation studies, it would be interesting to investigate which immune cell types are capable of recognizing inulin -type fructans and of mounting a subsequent cytokine response. This may be a wide range of cell types because many cell types express TLRs and CLRs. From there, results can be translated to the relevant populations which may actually come in contact with fructan molecules after their ingestion. Moreover, the capacity of APCs to report the presenc e of inulin -type fructans or parts of the molecules to effector cells is still an uncharted area of research which deserves further exploration. 1.13 Dietary fibers and intestinal barrier function By metadata analysis of dietary fiber studies in relation to health risks, it has now been generally established that dietary fiber intake is associated with a reduced incidence of disease [225 -228] and disease -related mortality [229 -232] . One of the suggested mechanisms by which disease is prevented is through the protection of the intestinal epithelial barri er [233] . By maintaining a proper barrier function, the luminal contents CHAPTER 1. IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS. 33 remain compartmentalized, and a state of tolerance is acquired. This physical barrier of epithelium is organized by focal contact points between the cells, known as tight junctions. Current literature reports demonstrate that many pathologies are in fact linked to an impaired intestinal barrier function [234] . This state of intestinal hyperpermeability, also known as leaky gut syndrome [235] , leads to increased translocation of bacteria, endotoxins and other macromolecules, triggering aberrant local peripheral immune reactio ns [236 -239] . Intestinal hyperpermeability has syndrome [253,254] . In addition, increased gut permeability is also implicated in several neurological disorders including schizophrenia [255] , autism spectrum disorders [256] , depression [256] , and anxiety [256] , suggesting that the compounds leaking through the in testinal wall can cause detrimental effects in organs as far removed and well -protected as the brain. Two prebiotic effects of dietary fibers are suggested to play a role in protection against these events, i.e. the stimulation of lactic acid producing bac teria, and the related increase in SCFA as fermentation products. For typical substrains such , it has already been shown that the presence of these bacteria in the gut optimizes the barrier function of the epithel ium as indicated by improved tight junction protein content, reduction in permeability to chemicals, and reduced translocation of bacteria. Of SCFA, mainly butyrate [18,262,263] , is capable of strengthening the epithelial barrier. Of the direct interaction of dietary fibers with epithelial cells and protection of their barrier function no information is available yet, to the best of our knowledge. 1.14 Chicory root pulp as valuable source of dietary fibers Besides a healthy lifestyle, s ustainability is in this day and age a goal which both the food industry and consumers are interested in. After extraction of the inulin -type fructans from chicory, the root pulp is left over as bypro duct. Usually this root pulp is applied as a livestock feed [264,265] . However, as the importance of a high fiber diet for a healthy lifestyle is becoming more evident, this byproduct could actually be a valuable CHAPTER 1. IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS. 34 source of dietary fibers for application in functional foods. To assess the potential effects of chicory root pulp, the studies described in this thesis were focused on creating a technology platform to test the beneficial properties and str ucture -response relationships of chicory root pulp fibers on the immune system and intestinal epithelial cells. Inulin -type fructans from chicory were used as model fibers to set up this platform to test fibers in primary cells and cell line models, and fi nally to test the application in human studies. Chicory root pulp (CRP) obtained after the extraction of inulin is rich in cell wall polysaccharides (CWP), and two major components of this chicory root pulp are cellulose [266] and pectin [267,268] . These two fiber types were analyzed for their immunomodulatory effects as well. In addition, the impact on barrier function of intestinal epithelial cells was tested. Finally, inulin -type fructans were evaluated for their in vivo immunomodulatory effects in a human supplementation study involving the analysis of hepatitis B vaccination efficacy combined with the analysis of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets. This experimental set up is an integral part of the technology platform, and may serve as a backbone to study immunemodulation by dietary fibers in future human supplementation trials. 1.15 General aim of the studies in this thesis As the importance of a healthy diet is gaining ground with the public, and since the field of nutritional immunology is expanding rapidly within the scientific world, studies into the immunological effects of dietary fibers are warranted, so that optimal use can be made of these naturally occurring plant products. With the identification of structure -response relationships, an additional advantage of these studies is that this knowledge can be used to make tailored functional food products with well-characterized effects. Based on the discussed immunological effects of dietary fibers we propose that the soluble and insoluble fibers from chicory root can be valuable nutritional compounds for improving and / or maintaining intestinal and systemic health by their bene ficial effects on immune cells, as well as on the intestinal epithelial barrier function. CHAPTER 1. IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS. 35 DESIGN AND RATIONALE As outlined in the preceding sections health effects of dietary fiber are well recognized but the mechanisms by which they accomplish health effects are not completely understood. Also the structure -response relationships for fibers are not well characterized so far. Inulin -type fructans were used as model fibers followed by analysis of the major chicory root pulp components cellulose and pect ins. In Chapter 2 we tested whether inulin -type fructans can exert direct signaling when in contact with immune cells, and if the pattern recognition receptors TLRs and NODs are involved. Moreover, the specific chain length -dependency of the responses was characterized. In Chapter 3 we investigated whether inulin -type fructans exert promoting or protective effects on the barrier function of human intestinal epithelial cells . Barrier function was disrupted with the agent phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA ). The dynamics of this process were studied with regard to timing of fiber incubation, and fructan chain length effects. As inulin -type fructans have recently been identified as TLR ligands [269] (Chapter 2), and TLR2 is highly important in intestinal barrier regulation [270] , the other aim of this study was to investigate whether receptor interactions with TLR2 on the epithelial surface are involved in inulin -type fructan mediated barrier modulation. In Chapter 4 the immunomodulatory capacity of the chicory root pulp component cellulose was tested. This was done using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The transcriptome of the cells was studied by gene c hip array. Also barrier function measurements were performed with human intestinal epithelial cells using PMA as damaging agent. In Chapter 5 another major component of chicory root pulp, pectin, was studied for its immunogenic and barrier protective effec ts. In addition, the structure -response properties of pectins were studied using pectins with different degrees of methyl esterification. These pectins were tested for TLR activating properties, and for barrier function effects on human intestinal epitheli al cells. In Chapter 6 we describe the results of a human supplementation study with different inulin -type fructan supplements. This study performed with inulin -type fructans -type fructans, and fructose as placebo supplement. In this study, the effects of fructan supplementation on hepatitis B vaccination efficacy, as well as on peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets was analyzed. In conclusion, the results of this thesis are summarized and discussed in Chapter 7 . CHAPTER 1. IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS. 37 References 1. Menrad K.

IMMUNE MODULATION BY DIFFERENT TYPES OF 21 -FRUCTANS IS TOLL -LIKE RECEPTOR DEPENDENT . 54 Abstract Introduction : 21 -fructans are dietary fibers. Main objectives of this study were 1) to demonstrate direct signaling of 21 -fructans on immune cells, 2) to study whether this is mediated by the pattern recognition receptors Toll -like receptors (TLRs) and nucleotide -binding oligomerization domain - containing proteins (NODs), and 3) to relate the observed effects to the chain length diffe rences in 21 -fructans. Methods: Four different 21 -fructan formulations were characterized for their chain length profile. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated in vitro with 21 -fructans , and production of IL -1Ra, IL -1, IL-6, IL -10, IL -12p70, and TNF - was analyzed. Reporter cells for TLRs and NODs were incubated with 21 - fructans and analyzed for NF -B/AP -1 activation. Results: Cytokine production in human PBMCs was dose -, and chain length -dependent. Strikingly, short cha in enriched 21 -fructans induced a regulatory cytokine balance compared to long chain enriched 21 -fructans as measured by IL -10/IL -12 ratios. Activation of reporter cells showed that signaling was highly dependent on TLRs and their adapter, myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88). In human embryonic kidney reporter cells, TLR2 was prominently activated, while TLR4, 5, 7, 8, and NOD2 were mildly activated. Conclusions: 21 -fructans possess direct signaling capacity on human immune cells. By activating primarily TLR2, and to a lesser extent TLR4, 5, 7, 8, and NOD2, 21 -fructan stimulation results in NF -B/AP -1 activation. Chain length of 21 -fructans is important for the induced activation pattern and IL -10/IL -12 ratios. CHAPTER 2 . IMMUNE MODULATION BY DIFFERENT TYPES OF 21 -FRUCTANS IS TOLL -LIKE RECEPTOR DEPENDENT . 55 Introduction 2.1 Background High fiber intake is associated with lower mortality in subjects suffering from circulatory, digestive, and non -cardiovascular non -cancerous inflammatory diseases [1-3]. The se associations are similar for men and women and are observed in most countries even after careful adjustment for potentially confounding lifestyle and dietary differences [4]. The mechanisms by which fibers contrib ute to reduced mortality remain to be identified but have been suggested to be of both metabolic and immunological nature [5]. Cereal fibers have been associated with lower concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers [4], but there is an urgent need for studies addressing specific fibers [4] to obtain a better understanding of mechanisms and components underlying protective associations. One of the many types of dietary fibers which have been reported to elicit health benefits are linear 21 -fructans (also named inulin -type fructans, ITFs, are made up of fructose subunits, can vary considerably i n chain length, and occur with or without the presence of a terminal glucose moiety [6]. The fructose oligomers are denoted as F n = number of fructose subunits, GF n = fructose chain terminated with a glucose molecule) [6]. The chain length can also be denoted by the Degree of Polymerization (DP), representing the number of monosaccharide subunits in the chain [6]. Whether these variations in composition cause different physiological responses is currently unknown. Ingestion of 21 -fructans induces specific effects on the immune system, as recently reviewed [7-11]. Changes in immunological parameters have been reported in the gut lumen, Peyer's patches, spleen, and blood [12-14]. These effects could be induced via a prebiotic mechanism by stimulating beneficial (\"probiotic\") bacteria in the intestine, such as bifidobacteria and lactobacilli [10]. This can coincide with modulation of fermentat ion products such as increased production of short chain fatty acids [15,16] , which affect the recruitment of lymphocytes to inflammatory sites [17,18] , and suppress the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [18-20]. Besides through these more indirect effects on the microbiota and its fermentation products, another pathway of modulation is gaining attention, i.e. through direct signaling on immune cells. This theory is supported by new insights into the structural and functional makeup of the intestine [21,22] . Some dietary fibers such as -glucans, modulate the human immune system by CHAPTER 2 . IMMUNE MODULATION BY DIFFERENT TYPES OF 21 -FRUCTANS IS TOLL -LIKE RECEPTOR DEPENDENT . 56 binding to pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on cells of the innate imm une system, such as Dectin -1 and Toll -like receptors (TLRs) [23-25]. so -called pathogen molecular patterns (PAMP s), which are small mol ecular motifs found on groups of pathogens but also on many microorganisms with beneficial or no effects on host health [26]. Because of their ability to recognize specific carbohydrate moieties and elicit immune responses, we hypothesized that PRRs, and more specifically TLRs and NODs are activated by 21 -fructans, and that this is one of the pathways by which 21 -fructans can influence the human immune system [27,28] . As little knowledge is available on the specific immunomodulating effects of different types of 21 -fructans, we investigated the effect of 21 -fructans with different chain lengths on cytokine release by human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) and we studied whether and which PRRs are involved in 21 -fructan recognition. Our studies support the concept that ITFs can signal directly on immune cells via TLRs and that chain length differences in ITFs can differentially affect immunological parameters. methods 2.2 Ethics Statement Chemical analyses (HPAEC and HPSEC) were performed at Wageningen University. Other experiments, including blood sampling of human volunteers, were conducted within the University Medical Center Groningen, in the Netherlands. Written informed consent was obtained, and data were analyzed and presented anonymously. This research and consent procedure have been a pproved by the ethical review board of the University Medical Center, Medisch Ethische Toetsingscommissie University Medical Center Groningen, as documented in the approved application ''2007/255''. All clinical investigation was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. 2.3 High Performance Anion Exchange Chromatography Four different 21 -fructan formulations were selected and their specific chain length profiles (range and distribution) were characterized by High Performance Anion Exchange Chromatography (HPAEC). The applied 21 -fructans were extracted from chicory root and comprise a mixture of different chain lengths varying from DP 2 to 60 , referred to as inulin or CHAPTER 2 . IMMUNE MODULATION BY DIFFERENT TYPES OF 21 -FRUCTANS IS TOLL -LIKE RECEPTOR DEPENDENT . 57 native inulin [29]. These chicory root 21 -fructan chains are terminated by a glucose molecule [6]. Fructans of varying DP can be acquired by partial enzymatic hydrolysis of this extract resulting in GF n and F n chains with GF n ranging from DP 2 to 10 [6]. Another way to obtain 21 - fructans is to synthesize them from sucrose, resulting in GF n type fructans with DP 2 [30]. BV, Roosendaal, The Netherlands. Endotoxin levels (endotoxin units, EU) of all used 21 -fructan samples were assessed by Toxikon (Leuven, Belgium) and were below 0.3 x 10-3 \u00b5g-1. For HPAEC, a Dionex ICS 3000 system (Dionex), equipped with a Dionex CarboPac PA -1 column (2 x 250 mm) in combination with a CarboPac PA -1 guard column (2 x 50 mm) was used. Sample concentrations of 0.05 - 0.1 mg/ml and partial -loop injection of 10 \u00b5l were applied. The system wa s equipped with pulsed amperometric detection. Elution was performed at 0.3 ml/min. and oligomers were separated using a gradient as follows: 0 -400mM NaOAc in 100 mM NaOH within 40 min., followed by a 5 min. washing step (1M NaOAc in 100 mM NaOH), and 15 min. equilibration (100 mM NaOH). 2.4 High Pressure Size Exclusion Chromatography 21 -fructan formulations were tested for their elution profile using High Performance Size Exclusion Chromatography (HPSEC) on Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The analysis was performed on three TSK -Gel columns connected in series (4000 -3000 -2500 SuperAW; 150 x 6 mm). The columns were preceded by a TSK Super AW -L guard column (35 x 4.6 mm). All columns were from Tosoh Bioscience (Tokyo, Japan). Elutio n was performed at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. using sodium nitrate (0.2 M) as the eluent. A volume of 20 \u00b5l of the sample (2.5 mg/ml) in millipore water was injected and eluted at 55\u00b0C. Solubles were detected using a refractive index detector, Shodex type RI 101 (Showa Denko, Japan). The software used for acquiring the data was Chromeleon version 7. Molecular weight distribution of polysaccharides was determined using pullulan standards (Polymer Laboratories, Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA) in the molecula r mass range of 0.18 - 790 kDa. CHAPTER 2 . IMMUNE MODULATION BY DIFFERENT TYPES OF 21 -FRUCTANS IS TOLL -LIKE RECEPTOR DEPENDENT . 58 2.5 Isolation Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells Human PBMCs were used to study whether 21 -fructans can signal on immune cells, especially since PBMCs express many PRRs such as TLRs [31,32] and NODs [33]. Peripheral blood from human volunteers was collected in heparinized tubes (15 IU/ml lithium -heparin, Becton Dickinson B.V., Netherlands) and were solated by Ficoll density gradient separation (Lymphoprep, Axis -Shield, Oslo, Norway). Cells were kept in RPMI1640 medium (Gibco, Life Technologies, Bleiswijk, The Netherlands) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, HyClone, Thermo Scientific, Bred a, The Netherlands) and 50 \u00b5g/ml gentamicin (Gibco). 2.6 Cytokine expression As a read out for PBMC activation, cytokine production in the medium was analyzed after stimulation of PBMCs with a concentration series of 21 - fructans. To evaluate whether 21 -fructans induce a more anti - inflammatory or pro -inflammatory effect, and whether chain length profile would affect this balance, the IL -10/IL -12 ratio was calculated for each 21 -fructan formulation at 1 \u00b5g/ml or 100 \u00b5g/ml. In this context, a higher I L-10/IL -12 ratio is representative of a more anti -inflammatory effect [34,35] . Human PBMCs (n=6 ; 3 males, 3 females, age 25 -42 yr., healthy non -smoker volunteers) were seeded in a 24 wells p late at a density of 2 x 106 cells/well with a final volume of 1 ml/well. To characterize possible effects of different chain length profiles on cytokine expression, the 21 -fructan formulations ITF I to IV were dissolved in culture medium and added to th e PBMCs at final concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 g/ml. After 24h of incubation (37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2) cytokine levels in measured using a Bio manufacturer's instructions. (Bio -Rad Laboratories, Veenendaal, The Netherlands). This customized kit simultaneously measured human IL -1Ra, IL -1, IL-6, IL -10, IL -12p70, and TNF-. Concentration series of cytokine standards were prepared for th e appropriate concentration range, and coupled beads were diluted ten times, resuspended, and added to a pre -wetted filter plate. After washing the plate twice, standards, negative controls and samples (all in duplicate) were transferred into the plate (50 \u00b5l per well), and the plate was sealed and incubated on a shaker at room temperature (RT) for 30 min. After incubation, the plate was washed three times, detection antibodies were resuspended and diluted ten times and 25 \u00b5l was added to each well. The CHAPTER 2 . IMMUNE MODULATION BY DIFFERENT TYPES OF 21 -FRUCTANS IS TOLL -LIKE RECEPTOR DEPENDENT . 59 plate was incubated on a shaker at RT for 30 min., and after washing three times, 50 \u00b5l of streptavidin -phycoerythrin was added to each well and the plate was incubated on a shaker at RT for 10 min. After washing the plate three times, 125 \u00b5l of assay buffer was added per well, the plate was incubated on a shaker for 5 min. and fluorescence was measured using a Luminex 100 System and StarStation software. All procedures as of the incubation with detection antibodies were performed in the dark. 2.7 Cell cultu re of reporter cell lines Selection media, Normocin antibiotic, Quanti -blue reagent, TLR agonists and the following cell lines were acquired from InvivoGen (InvivoGen, Toulouse, France). Two THP -1 human acute monocytic leukemia repor ter cell lines were acquired from InvivoGen, both endogenously expressing human TLRs and with inserted construct Secreted coupled to the promoter. The first of these THP -1 cell lines carries extra inserts for MD2 and CD14 to boost TLR signaling, and the second THP -1 cell line expresses only a truncated, non -functional form of the TLR adapter MyD88. Nine different human Embryonic Kidney (HEK293) -Blue reporter cell lines were purchased from InvivoGen, each with a different inserted construct for an inserted construct for Secreted Embryonic Alkaline Phosphatase Both THP -1 RPMI1640 10% mM), sodium pyruvate (1 mM) U/ml and 50 \u00b5g/ml), and (100 \u00b5g/ml), all from -Aldrich Chemie B.V., Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands. Both THP -1 cell lines were kept at a concentration of 5x105 cells/ml. HEK -Blue cells were maintained in DMEM (Life Technologies Europe B.V.) containing 1 0% heat inactivated FBS, L - glutamine (2 U/ml and 50 \u00b5g/ml), and HEK cells were grown to 80% confluency. After culturing for 3 passages, all reporter cell lines were maintained in se lection media according to the manufacturer's protocol. 2.8 Reporter cell stimulations and Quanti -BlueTM analysis THP-1 cells were centrifuged for 5 min. at 300 g to collect the cells and resuspended to the cell density specified by the manufacturer's pr otocol (Table 1). In a flat bottom 96 wells plate, 100 \u00b5l of this cell suspension per CHAPTER 2 . IMMUNE MODULATION BY DIFFERENT TYPES OF 21 -FRUCTANS IS TOLL -LIKE RECEPTOR DEPENDENT . 60 well was stimulated for 24h (37C, 5% CO 2) with 10 \u00b5l of stimulus, i.e. concentration series (1 \u00b5g/ml - 2 mg/ml) of 21 -fructan formulations ITF I to IV, or the relevant positive control as indicated by the manufacturer's protocol (Table 1). Plain culture medium and endotoxin -free water were applied as negative controls. After incubation, 20 \u00b5l of cell culture medium of stimulated reporter cells was incubated with 180 \u00b5l of Quanti -blue reagent in a new flat bottom 96 wells plate for 45 min at 37C and SEAP activity (absorbance), representing activation of NF -B/AP was measured at 650 nm on a reader (Molecular Devices GmbH, Biberach an der Riss, Germa ny) using SoftMax Pro Data Acquisition & Analysis Software. HEK -Blue reporter cells were rinsed with medium to detach them from the culture flask and cells were resuspended to the cell density specified by the manufacturer's protocol (Table 1). 180 \u00b5l of c ell suspension per well was stimulated for 24h (37C, 5% CO 2) with 20 \u00b5l of 21 -fructan, endotoxin free water, plain culture medium or positive control (Table 1) in a flat bottom 96 wells plate. For all HEK cell lines, after incubation, analysis of SEAP w as performed in the same way as described for the THP -1 cells. Table 1. Cell densities and positive controls used in reporter cell stimulations 2.9 Statistical analysis Significance levels were determined by parametric Student's t -test for unpaired observations (two -tailed) or by -parametric Mann -Whitney U-test for unpaired observations (two -tailed). Results are expressed as mean SEM or mean SD respectively. A P-value < 0.05 was con sidered statistically significant. P-values < 0.05 are denoted with *, P-values < 0.01 are denoted with **, and P-values < 0.001 are denoted with ***. CHAPTER 2 . IMMUNE MODULATION BY DIFFERENT TYPES OF 21 -FRUCTANS IS TOLL -LIKE RECEPTOR DEPENDENT . 61 Results 2.10 Chemical characterization of 21 -fructan formulations The oligomer profiles of four 21 -fructan formulations were characterized using HPAEC and HPSEC. Figure 1A depicts the oligosaccharide range and relative response per oligomer of the 21 - fructan formulations tested with HPAEC. Figure 1B represents the HP SEC analysis of the four different 21 -fructan formulations, showing the elution patterns as a measure for the molecular size distributions of these compounds in kDa. The HPSEC analysis corroborated the observed chain length profiles from the HPAEC analys is and in addition this method rendered a visual representation of the degree in which the different chain lengths are pr esent per analyzed formulation. The most important differences can be observed between ITF I and II as compared to ITF III and IV. ITF I can described as fructooligosaccharide (FOS) with mostly chain lengths of <10, and ITF II can be described as a FOS -enriched inulin, with a large proportion of chains smaller than DP10, but also containing chains with DP up to 25. ITF III and IV are desc ribed as \"inulin\" due to their broad range of chain lengths present (up to DP60). ITF I and II contain mostly chains of the type GF 3, GF 4, and GF 5, (i.e. starting with a glucose molecule followed by 3, 4, or 5 fructose subunits) and F 3, F4, or F 5 (chains consisting only of 3, 4, or 5 fructose moieties). Between ITF I and II, ITF I contains relatively more F n type oligosaccharides and ITF II contains relatively more GF n type molecules. ITF III and IV consist solely of the GF n type fructans while IT F I and II consist of both GF n and F n fructans. Glucose and fructose monomers, and GF and GF dimers of glucose and fructose subunits and trimers made up of one glucose subunit and two fructose subunits) are present in all four ITFs . 2.11 21 -fructans induce cytokine production in human PBMCs To gain insight into dose effects and to determine which cytokines are induced by 21 -fructans we first screened for a panel of pro - and anti - inflammatory cytokines, i.e. IL -1, IL-6, IL -12, TNF -, IL-1Ra, and IL -10, after stimulating human PBMCs for 24 hours with 21 -fructans. This was done for ITF I, in doses of 1/ 2,5/ 5/ 10, and 100 g/ml. As shown in Figure 2, IL-1Ra expression was decreased for lower doses (2,5 to 10 \u00b5g/ml 21 -fructans) and inc reased at 100 \u00b5g/ml 21 -fructans (p<0.05, panel A). CHAPTER 2 .

Statistical significance levels were determined with a parametric Student's t -test for unpaired observations (two -tailed). Mean and SEM of cytokine production is plotted as percentage of controls, which were set to 100% (n = 4). Panels A to F show the results for IL -1Ra, IL -1b, IL- 6, IL-10, IL -12, and TNF -a respectively. The same pattern was observed for IL -6; expression was decreased for 2.5 \u00b5g/ml (p<0.05) and a substantial increase was observed at 100 \u00b5g/ml (p<0.01, panel C). IL-10 expression was increased, especially at 1 \u00b5g/ml (p<0.001) and 100 \u00b5g/ml (p<0.0001, panel D). A small increase for TNF was observed at 100 \u00b5g/ml (12%, p<0.05, panel F). Since a dose as low as CHAPTER 2 . IMMUNE MODULATION BY DIFFERENT TYPES OF 21 -FRUCTANS IS TOLL -LIKE RECEPTOR DEPENDENT . 64 1 \u00b5g/ml induced a significant increase for IL -10, and 100 \u00b5g/ml induced significant and substantial increases, these low end and high end doses were subsequently used for further cytokine measurements in PBMCs. 2.12 Inulin -type fructan -induced cytokine production by human PBMCs is chain length dependent To gai n insight into size -response relationships, we investigated whether the chain length of 21 -fructans has an effect on the type and quantity of cytokines produced by PBMCs. ITF I to IV were tested at the concentrations of 1 and 100 g/ml. IL -6 and IL -10 we re mainly induced by ITF I and ITF II ( Figure 3 ) which can therefore be mainly attributed to short chain molecules enriched in these formulations, i.e. F 2-F5 and GF 2-GF 5 respectively. Production of IL -12 was slightly increased by ITF II and strongly induce d by ITF III and IV, indicating that longer chains (>DP8, GF n type) have to be held resp onsible for this effect. Figure 3. Induction of cytokines by inulin -type fructan formulations with different chain length (DP range), at 0, 1, and 100 mg/ml. Statistical significance levels were determined with a non -parametric Mann -Whitney U -test for unpaired observations (two -tailed). Mean and SD of cytokine expression are plotted as percentage of controls (represented by 0 mg/ml), which were set to 100% (n = 6). Panel A to D represent cytokine expression induced by ITF I to IV respectively. CHAPTER 2 . IMMUNE MODULATION BY DIFFERENT TYPES OF 21 -FRUCTANS IS TOLL -LIKE RECEPTOR DEPENDENT . 65 Similarly, the highest production of TNF - was observed after incubation with ITF IV. These combined results showed that chain length profile of 21 -fructan formulations is an important determinant of the cytokine profile which is induced upon stimulation. Next, the IL -10/IL -12 ratios were calculated to quantify whether there is a correlation between chain length profile and cytokine balance (Figure 4 ). IL-10/IL12 ratios can be applied to calculate the regulatory effects of bioactive food components [36]. Controls were set to 100, and a ratio of more than 100 was considered to be regulatory or anti - inflam matory, whereas a ratio lower than 100 was considered to be proinflammatory. Strikingly, the IL -10/IL -12 ratios gradually decreased in the sequence of ITF I > ITF II > ITF III > ITF IV, indicating that shorter chain fructans induce a regulatory cytokine ba lance in human PBMCs compared to longer chain fructans. When taking the structural differences into consideration ( Figure 1 ) it can be concluded that the molecules F 2-F5 and/or GF 2-GF 5, which are enriched in ITF I and II, skew the IL -10/IL -12 ratio in PBMC s more towards IL -10, and thus induce a more anti - inflammatory balance. Figure 4. Ratio of IL -10/IL -12 upon incubation of PBMCs with different chain length inulin - type fructans. PBMCs (n = 6) were stimulated with 1 mg/ml (panel A) and 100 mg/ml (panel B) inulin -type fructans for 24h. Statistical significance levels were determined with a non - parametric Mann -Whitney U -test for unpaired observations (two -tailed). Mean and SD of the IL -10/IL -12 ratios is plotted for the different inulin -type fructans as percentage of controls, which were set to 100% (n = 6) and horizontal bars indicate the significant differences between inulin -type fructan treatments. CHAPTER 2 . IMMUNE MODULATION BY DIFFERENT TYPES OF 21 -FRUCTANS IS TOLL -LIKE RECEPTOR DEPENDENT . 66 2.13 activation of NF -B/AP -1 by 21 -fructans is dependent on the presence of functional TLR adapter MyD88 Next, we investigated whether the activation of immune cells can be explained by activation of PRRs by the 21 -fructans. To this end we applied the following strategy. Figure 5. NF-kB/AP -1 defMyD reporter cells. Statistical significance levels were determined with a non -parametric Mann -Whitney U -test for unpaired observations (two -tailed). and SD of NF -kB/AP -1 activation by inulin - type fruct ans of different chain lengths (ITF I, II, III and IV) are plotted as percentage of negative controls (unstimulated cells), which were set to 100% for both cell lines. LPS stimulation was used as a common positive control for TLR4/MyD88 signalling to NF - kB/AP-1 in the functional THP -1 MD2 -CD14 cell line. TriDAP was used as a positive control in THP -1 DefMyD cells, which induces MyD88 -independent signalling -kB/AP -1. Panel A to D represent cytokine expression induced by ITF I to IV respectively. Only co ncentrations which induced activation in the THP -1 MD1 -CD14 cells are shown for comparison of these concentrations in the THP -1 DefMyD cells. CHAPTER 2 . IMMUNE MODULATION BY DIFFERENT TYPES OF 21 -FRUCTANS IS TOLL -LIKE RECEPTOR DEPENDENT . 67 First, 21 -fructans were tested for the ability to induce NF -B/AP -1 transcription in a THP -1 reporter cell line which endogenously expresses all TLRs, and carries extra inserts for co -signaling molecules CD14 and MD2 to increase the TLR -mediated responses. NF -B and AP -1 are essential transcription factors in signaling for cytokine release [37]. ITF I and II induced a statistically significant elevation of NF -B/AP - 1 activation in THP -1 MD2 -CD14 cells, while ITF III and ITF IV only induced activation at higher doses ( Figure 5 ). The strongest activation was observed for ITF II, which is mainly short chain GF n. Next, we investigated whether the activation was TLR -dependent by testing the 21 -fructans on a specific THP -1 reporter cell line carrying truncated TLR adapter molecule MyD88. These THP -1 DefMyD only non -functional MyD88, whereas the functional MyD88 is an essential adapter molecule for TLR2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 signaling. The 21 -fructan doses which significantly activated THP -1 MD2 -CD14 cells were subsequently tested in cells. 21 -fruct an mediated NF -B/AP -1 activation appeared to be TLR dependent as the activation pattern as observed in THP-1 MD2 -CD14, was virtually absent in the MyD88 deficient cell line. This indicated that 21 -fructan mediated signaling to NF -kB/AP -1 was TLR2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and/or 9 dependent. Slight activation of THP -1 DefMyD cells by ITF IV suggests that other activation pathways independent of MyD88 may also have been induced by high concentrations of the longer chain 21 -fructans which are enriched in t his ITF. 2.14 21 -fructans induce strong dose dependent activation of TLR2, slight activation of TLR4, 5, 7, 8, and NOD2, but no activation of TLR3, TLR9, or NOD1. The results from the THP -1 cell stimulations showed that TLRs are involved in 21 -fruct an signaling. Next, we investigated which TLRs are specifically activated by 21 -fructans and whether the intracellular PRRs NODs were activated. To this end, HEK reporter cell lines, each carrying one construct for a specific TLR or NOD, were stimulated with 21 - fructans in the same way as described for the THP -1 cells ( Figure 6 ). Strikingly, HEK cells with TLR2 construct were strongly and dose dependently activated by the 21 -fructans. Moreover, this response was chain length dependent, as NF -B/AP -1 activation in HEK TLR2 cells increased with increasing chain length in the sequence of ITF I < ITF II < ITF III < ITF IV. In these cells, long chain fructans induced the strongest activation, up to 6 -fold induction as compared to control. To a lesse r extent, HEK cells carrying either TLR4, 5, 7, 8, or NOD2 were activated CHAPTER 2 . IMMUNE MODULATION BY DIFFERENT TYPES OF 21 -FRUCTANS IS TOLL -LIKE RECEPTOR DEPENDENT . 68 upon 21 -fructan stimulation. HEK cells expressing TLR3, 9 or NOD1 were not significantly activated by 21 -fructan stimulation (data not shown). These data combined show that TLR b inding was 21 -fructan type -, and thus chain length dependent. Discussion We hypothesized that 21 -fructans can affect the immune status through physical contact with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on gut immune cells such as IELs [38] or DCs [27,28] . to cytokine production [31,39] , we used these cells to test whether 21 -fructans would also induce production of cytokines. Both anti - inflammatory and proinflammatory cytokines were produced, demonstrating that 21 -fructans have the ability to activate human immune cells. Interesting ly, chain length proved to be an important factor in skewing the cytokine balance. Anti -inflammatory IL -10 was strongly induced by short chain 21 -fructans and a striking correlation was observed between the ratio of IL -10/IL -12 and the chain lengths of t he fibers. The IL -10/IL -12 ratio has previously been used to evaluate the effects of probiotic bacteria on immune responses [40,41] , and to describe anti-inflammatory effects of butyrate [42]. It is therefore useful to apply the same approach to study the effect of prebiotic fibers. It can be concluded on the basis of our data that the short chain molecules which are more abundant in ITF I and II, skew the I L-10/IL -12 ratio in PBMCs more towards IL -10, and thus induce a more anti - inflammatory balance. When considering that the proportion of short chain fructans of the GFn type are also distributed as ITF I > ITF II > ITF III, the results also suggest that spe cifically the short chain fructans of the GF n type determine the outcome of this cytokine ratio. In spite of the fact that longer chains induced more IL -12 compared to shorter chains, the induced IL-10/IL -12 ratio is not significantly different from the ra tio measured in the control cells, indicating that they are more pro -inflammatory as compared to the shorter chains but not pro -inflammatory per se, when compared to controls. IL -6 production was observed for higher concentrations of ITF I and II. Although IL-6 production is generally regarded as proinflammatory, IL -6 can exert several anti -inflammatory effects such as inhibition of TNF - function [43], and activation of IL -1Ra and IL -10 [44]. CHAPTER 2 . IMMUNE MODULATION BY DIFFERENT TYPES OF 21 -FRUCTANS IS TOLL -LIKE RECEPTOR DEPENDENT . 69 Figure 6. NF-kB/AP -1 activation of HEK cell lines overexpressing separate TLRs or NODs. Statistical significance levels were determined with a non -parametric Mann -Whitney U -test for unpaired observations (two -tailed). Mean and SD of NF-kB/AP -1 activation in HEK cell lines stimulated with inulin -type fructans for 24 h are plotted as percentage of unstimulated controls, which were set to 100%. Dosages are plotted in mg/ml. Endotoxin free H 2O was used as an additional negative control an d per cell line the relevant positive controls were applied as mentioned in Table 1. Only few studies have addressed in vitro stimulation of immune cells by 21 -fructans and cytokine profiles. In a study of Eiwegger et al. [45] three types of prebiotic oligosaccharides, including a mixture of short chain galactooligosaccharides (scGOS) and long chain 21 -fructans were analyzed for the induction of a selected panel of cytokines in cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs ). The mixture containing long chain 21 - CHAPTER 2 . IMMUNE MODULATION BY DIFFERENT TYPES OF 21 -FRUCTANS IS TOLL -LIKE RECEPTOR DEPENDENT . 70 fructans did not induce IL -10 in these experiments which corroborates our findings. Long chain 21 -fructans alone, or short chain 21 -fructans were not tested in the Eiwegger study, which would allow for a more complete comparison with our results. In supplementation studies in experimental animal s, the observed immune effects with 21 -fructans such as increased cytokine productions, increased serum and secretory [13,46 and TLR4+ DCs [50] could be due to direct effect s of 21 -fructan -mediated TLR activation in the intestine, be it on immune cells or intestinal epithelial cells [51]. However, the underlying mechanisms in these in vivo experiments are likely to be more complex and are pr obably the result of combined direct and indirect effects in the intestine. Also other studies corroborate our findings on chain length effects and differences in induced immune parameters . In a study where r ats were supplemented with shorter chain 21 -fructans (DP2 -8), increased ex vivo secretions of IL -10 were observed in cells from the Peyer's patches [13,52 -54] and mesenteric lymph nodes [53]. In another study by Ito et al . the effect of different chain length 21 -fructans on prebiotic and immunomodulatory parameters in rats was studied [55]. In this study, 21 -fructans supplementatio n increased the cecal lactobacilli and bifidobacteria counts and that IgA concentrations were increased in the order DP4 > DP8 > DP16. In addition, DP4, DP8, and DP16, but not DP23, IgA -producing plasma cells in the cecal mucosa. IFN - and IL -10 production in cecal CD4(+) T cells was enhanced solely by DP4. These results confirm that in vivo, chain length of 21 -fructans is also of importance to the immunological response and the fact that these parameters were not correlated to any of the observ ed bacterial changes suggests that this is a direct effect on (immune) cells. This size exclusion effect for direct signaling of 21 -fructans in vivo was previously suggested by Seifert and Watzl [8]. As there are many families of PRRs with typical carbohydrate binding properties and immunomodulatory capacities [56], we applied a strategy to target TLRs and NODs: as shown in this study, the activating capacity of 21 -fructans on THP -1 cells was MyD88 dependent, and activation of TLR2 expressing HEK cells was strongly induced, which implies that signaling through TLRs, and specifically TLR2, is important in the immunomodulatory capacity of 21 . Other -type Lectin -like or RIG -like receptors do not signal via MyD88, but utilize other mechanisms and molecules to trans duce their signal [58,59] . CHAPTER 2 . IMMUNE MODULATION BY DIFFERENT TYPES OF 21 -FRUCTANS IS TOLL -LIKE RECEPTOR DEPENDENT . 71 When studying 21 -fructan mediated activation of HEK cells expressing individual TLRs or NODS, we observed that NF -B/AP -1 was strongly induced via activation of TL R2, and to a lesser extent by TLR4, 5, 7, 8, and NOD2. No activation was observed for TLR3, 9, or NOD1. TLR3 does not signal to NF -1 adapter [60]. However, activation by 21 -fructans was virtually absent in the THP -1 DefMyD cells, indicating the importance of MyD88 -related TLRs and no involvement of TLR3. TLR2 has many natural ligands of bacterial , fungal, viral, and even endogenous nature [61]. One of these is zymosan, a yeast PAMP consisting of -glucans [62], which bear similarity to 21 -fructans because both are prebiotic polysaccharides with -glycosidic bonds. Although -glucans are different molecules, it is tempting to speculate that the mechanism of TLR ligation by 21 -fructans is similar to that of -glucans, but this requires further biochemical studi es. Another way of inducing different signals might be mechanistic differences in receptor interactions at the cellular surface. It is possible that the shorter chains only activate a few receptors at a time, and the receptors may be located relatively di stant from each other, whereas the longer chain 21 -fructans might show a property of clustering the relevant receptors on the membrane, thereby creating a molecular complex which enhances signal transduction or alters the downstream outcome. This cluster ing mechanism has been described for LPS, clustering substantial numbers of TLR4 [63] and may be a relevant mechanism for other TLRs as well. To our best knowledge this is the first study addressing the direct mecha nism behind the immunomodulating capacity of specific 21 - fructans, with the aim to get more insight into the protective associations attributed to dietary fibers in epidemiological studies [4]. We demonstrated the principle that 21 -fructans possess direct signaling capacity on human immune cells, mainly through TLR2. These results suggest that direct TLR2 signaling events on immune cells could be part of the mechanism by which IL -10 production is induced in in viv o 21 - fructan supplementation studies. Also we show structure -function relationships in vitro for 21 -fructans which illustrate that caution should be taken in ascribing beneficial health effects to families of molecules with the similar structural features, as seemingly minor differences in chain length could induce opposite effects.

TOLL -LIKE RECEPTOR 2 ACTIVATION BY 21 -FRUCTANS PROTECTS BARRIER FUNCTION OF T84 HUMAN INTESTINAL EPITHELIAL CELLS IN A CHAIN LENGTH -DEPENDENT MANNER. 78 Abstract Introduction: Dietary fiber intake is associated with lower incidence and mortality from disease, but the underlying mechanisms of these protective effects are unclear. We hypothesized that 21 -fructan dietary fibers confer protection on intestinal epithelial cell barrier function via Toll -like receptor 2 (TLR2), and we studied whether 21 -fructan chain -length differences affect this process. Methods: T84 human intestinal epithelial cell monolayers we re incubated with 4 21 -fructan formulations of different chain -length compositions and were stimulated with the proinflammatory phorbol 12 - myristate 13 -acetate (PMA). Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was analyzed by electric cell substrate im pedance sensing (ECIS) as a measure for tight junction -mediated barrier function. To confirm TLR2 involvement in barrier modulation by 21 -fructans , ECIS experiments were repeate TLR2 blocking antibody. Results: After preincubation of T84 cells wit h short -chain 21 - fructans , the decrease in TEER as induced by PMA (62.3 6 5.2%, P < 0.001) was strongly attenuated (15.2 6 8.8%, P < 0.01). However, when PMA was applied first, no effect on recovery was observed during addition of the fructans. By blocki ng TLR2 on the T84 cells, the protective effect of short - chain 21 -fructans was substantially inhibited. Stimulation of human embryonic kidney human TLR2 reporter cells with 21 -fructans induced activation of nuclear factor kappa -light -chain -enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B), confirming that 21 -fructans are specific ligands for TLR2. Conclusions: To conclude, 21 -fructans exert time -dependent and chain length -dependent protective effects on the T84 intestinal epithelial cell barrier mediated via TL R2. These results suggest that TLR2 located on intestinal epithelial cells could be a target of 21 -fructan - mediated health effects. CHAPTER 3. TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR 2 ACTIVATION BY 21 -FRUCTANS PROTECTS BARRIER FUNCTION OF T84 HUMAN INTESTINAL EPITHELIAL CELLS IN A CHAIN LENGTH -DEPENDENT MANNER. 79 Introduction 3.1 Background It is becoming more accepted that dietary fiber intake leads to a reduced incidence of disea se (1-4) and related mortality (5-8). The mechanisms behind this effect of dietary fibers are still incompletely understood. Factors that were suggested to play an important role are improvement of the gut microbiota composition and the related SCFA profiles in the intestine (9-11). However, direct immune effects by ligand interaction of the fibers with so -called pattern recognition receptors on gut immune cells (12-15) were also suggested. Another mechanism by which dietary fibers may contribute to health is by modulating the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier. A disrupted barrier is considered to pla y a role in the etiology and pathogenesis of several diseases (16), such as atopic eczema (17, 18) , asthma (19, 20) , inflammatory bowel disease (21, 22) , diabetes (23-25), obesity (26, 27) , celiac disease (28-30), and diarrhea -predominant irritable bowel syndrome (31, 32) . A compromised intestinal barrier can be associated with hyperpermeability, also described as leaky gut syndrome (33). Disruption leads to increased translocation of bacteria, endotoxins, and other macromolecules, which can be important triggers for aberrant local or peripheral immune reactions (27, 34 -36). A category of widely used dietary fibers is forme d by 21 -fructans . Depending on the polymer chain lengths, these fibers are also described as inulin, inulin -type fructans (ITFs), fructooligosaccharides, or oligofructose (10). 21 - fructans are well studied for t heir beneficial effects on the gut microbiota and health (10, 37 -41). Studies into the effects of 21 -fructans on immune cells suggest that they exert direct effects by receptor -ligand interactions and subsequent cytokine production (15, 42) . However, direct effects of 21 -fructans on the barrier integrity of hu man intestinal epithelial cells are, to the best of our knowledge, not available. Previous studies from our group suggest that chain -length differences of 21 - fructans should be taken into consideration when studying their signaling effects: shorter -chain 21 -fructans induce a more anti -inflammatory cytokine profile in isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared with long -chain 21 -fructans (15). Differences in chain length of 21 -fructans may also induce different effects on epithelial cells. We investigated whether 21 -fructans exert protective effects on barrier function of human intestinal epithelial cells. This was done by analyzing the effect of 21 -fructans on transepithelial electrical resi stance (TEER) CHAPTER 3. TOLL -LIKE RECEPTOR 2 ACTIVATION BY 21 -FRUCTANS PROTECTS BARRIER FUNCTION OF T84 HUMAN INTESTINAL EPITHELIAL CELLS IN A CHAIN LENGTH -DEPENDENT MANNER. 80 of T84 intestinal epithelial cell monolayers, damaged with the barrier - disruptive agent phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA). The dynamics of this process were studied with regard to timing of fiber incubation and fructan chain -length effect s. Because 21 -fructans were identified recently as Toll -like receptor (TLR) ligands (15) and TLR2 is highly important in intestinal barrier regulation (43), the other aim of this st udy was to investigate whether receptor interactions with TLR2 on the epithelial surface are involved in 21 -fructan -mediated barrier modulation. Methods 3.2 Experimental design T84 intestinal epithelial cells were grown to differentiated monolayer stage, and resistance across the monolayer was continuously measured at multiple frequencies after different challenges. M easurements performed at 500 Hz specifically represent the tight junction (TJ) mediated resistance and these were used to calculate th e AUC. To establish whether 21 - fructans exert protective or recovery effects, a damage model was introduced based on challenge of the T84 cells with a known barrier disrupting agent, PMA (44). The rationale for the fi rst experiment was to study whether 21 -fructans protect T84 cells against PMA -induced loss of TEER, and whether 21 -fructan chain length profile is important in TEER modulation. T84 cells were incubated for 24h, with four different formulations of 21 -fructans of different average DP and DP profile (ITF I-IV) provided by Sensus B.V., Roosendaal, the Netherlands, followed by addition of PMA (10 nM, Sigma -Aldrich Chemie B.V., the Netherlands). The second experiment was designed to investigate the possible time dependency of the effect of 21 -fructan incubation. Cells were stimulated in different order with different compounds; protocol I) incubation with PMA for 6h followed by removal of the medium and addition of 21 -fructans in culture medium at a fina l concentration of 100 g/mL, or protocol II) incubation for 24h with 21 -fructans, followed by addition of PMA. This stimulation medium was left on the cells for at least 6h to allow the PMA to take effect. As the interval for recovery in protocol I, a f ixed period of time was taken (12h) following removal of PMA medium. This period was based on the average recovery time of the cells treated with PMA followed by control medium, represented by TEER values returning to the initial value (100%). As a CHAPTER 3. TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR 2 ACTIVATION BY 21 -FRUCTANS PROTECTS BARRIER FUNCTION OF T84 HUMAN INTESTINAL EPITHELIAL CELLS IN A CHAIN LENGTH -DEPENDENT MANNER. 81 measure for induced recovery, AUC was plotted for this time frame relative to the AUC of untreated control (without PMA), which was set to 100%. For protocol II, the interval for protection against the reduction of TEER was based on the time frame starting at the addition of PMA until the maximal decrease in TEER was reached (after 6h), and this fixed time frame was taken to calculate the AUC relative to untreated controls. With the third experiment, we aimed to study the role of TLR2 in 21 -fructan mediated effe cts on T84 cells. To this end, T84 cells were incubated with culture medium or TLR2 blocking antibody (catalog # pab -hstlr2, 5 g/mL, InvivoGen, Toulouse, France) for 10 min prior to addition of 21 - fructans. Cells remained in this medium for 24h, followe d by addition of PMA. The 6h time frame following PMA addition was used for AUC calculations. Finally, to confirm that 21 -fructans signal through TLR2, HEK hTLR2 reporter cells were stimulated with ITFI -IV. 3.3 Investigational compounds To study the eff ects of 21 -fructans on intestinal epithelial cell barrier function, four different formulations were applied, based on the chemical characterization of their chain length profiles by High -Performance Anion - Exchange Chromatography and High Pressure Size E xclusion Chromatography (15). Endotoxin concentrations in the formulations were analyzed by Toxikon (Leuven, Belgium), and all fell below 0.3 x 10-3 endotoxin units (EU) g-1. Briefly, the average chain length of these formulations is as ITF I (Frutalose\u00ae OFP) < ITF IV (Frutafit\u00ae TEX). ITF I is a fructooligosaccharide (FOS) compound, with chain lengths of DP10. ITF II is an inulin, enriched with FOS, with most chains shorter than DP10, but also containing chains with DPs up to 60. ITF III is 'native' inulin, and ITF IV can be described as a long chain enriched inulin. Both ITF III and IV consist predominantly of chains rangin g from DP10 to DP60. Chain length profiles of the applied formulations are summarized in Figure 1 . 3.4 T84 cell culture T84 human colon carcinoma cells (Sigma -Aldrich Chemie B.V., Zwijndrecht, the Netherlands) were grown to ca. 80% confluency at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2 in culture medium consisting of 1:1 Ham's F12 medium:DMEM, acquired the Netherlands) gentamicin (50 \u00b5g/mL, Life Technologies Europe B.V., Bleisw ijk, the Netherlands). Cells were maintained as previously described (45). Trypsin was acquired from CHAPTER 3.

Chain -length distribution of the applied fructan formulations. ITF I consists predominantly of fructan chains of DP3 -DP10 and a small portion of monomers. ITF II consists mainly of fructan chains of DP3 -DP10 but also contains chain lengths up to DP60 and a small portion of monomers. ITF III consists mainly of fructan chains of DP10 -DP60, and a smaller porti on is made up of fructan chains of DP3 -DP10 and monomers. ITF IV comprises mostly chains longer than DP10, a small portion of DP3 -DP10, and (Titriplex III) from Merck Millipore, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. 3.5 Trans Epithelial Electrical Resistance measurements Multiple electrode gold -plated 8 well chamber slides (8W10E, Applied Biophysics, IBIDI, M\u00fcnchen, Germany) were coated with 400 \u00b5L/well of a 0.2% L -cysteine (Sigma -Aldrich Chemie B.V.) solution in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Wells were washed twice with PBS, and coated overnight at room temperature with 400 \u00b5L/well of 1% PureCo lTM bovine tail collagen and 0.1% BSA (Sigma -Aldrich Chemie B.V.) in PBS. Wells were then washed twice with culture medium and cells were seeded at a density of 2x104 cells per well in a final culture volume of 40 0 L/well. Prior to stimulation, the cells were maintained in the wells for 14 days to reach a stable TEER. Medium was changed twice a week. The chamber slides were put into an ECIS incubator (Z-Theta model, Applied Biophysics, Troy, New York, USA) and res istance was measured continuously at multiple frequencies (46). CHAPTER 3.

As positive control, the additional TLR2 agonist heat killed Listeria monocytogenes was applied by adding 20 \u00b5l solution to 180 \u00b5l of cell suspension (1x108 bacteria/mL, InvivoGen). 3.7 Statistical analysis Statisti cal analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software. D'Agostino & Pearson omnibus normality test was used to test for normal data distribution. Statistical significance levels were determined by one - way ANOVA and Tukey's Multiple Comparison test o r by Dunnett's Multiple comparison test to compare treatment with controls. Results are expressed as mean SD. P -values < 0.05 were con sidered statistically significant. Results 3.8 21 -fructans exert chain length dependent protection against PMA -induced loss of barrier function in T84 intestinal epithelial cells To study whether 21 -fructans protect T84 cells against PMA -induced loss of TEER, and whether 21 -fructan chain length profile is important in TEER modulation, T84 cells were incubated with four different formulations of 21 -fructans of different average DP and DP profile, (ITF I-IV). AUC for the 6h time period following PMA addition was plotted for the different ITF trea tments, as a percentage of the AUC of untreated control, which was set to 100 % ( Figure 2). The damage model of PMA treatment induced a decrease in TEER, resulting in an AUC of 61.5 \u00b1 5.8% (P<0.001) as compared to control. Strikingly, 24h of preincubation of T84 cells with 100 g/mL of the ITF I or ITF II 21 -fructans conferred a protective effect against PMA -induced loss of resistance (P<0.001 and P<0.01 respectively). ITF I conferred the strongest protection, with an AUC of 91.0 \u00b1 6.6% of the control AUC , which rendered an 75.4 \u00b1 3.2% of the control AUC. TEER values for treatment with the longer chain compounds (ITF III and IV) were not statistically different from TEER values as induced by PMA treatment, demonstrating that thes e compounds did not exert a protective effect. These results indicate that the protective effect of 21 -fructans is a chain length dependent phenomenon, which is only conferred by the short chain formulations ITF I and ITF II. CHAPTER 3.

ITF, inulin -type fructan; PMA, phorbol 12 -myristate 13 protective effect of short chain 21 -fructans against PMA - induced T84 barrier loss is time dependent To establish if timing of short chain 21 -fructan incubation is important in their functionalit y, two protocols for incubation were applied; I) preincubation of T84 cells with PMA for 6h followed by removal of the medium and addition of short chain 21 -fructans (ITF I) in culture medium, and II) preincubation of T84 cells for 24h. with ITF I follow ed by addition of PMA ( Figure 3). Figure 3A shows an example representative of relative TEER values obtained with protocol I, and the 12h interval used to calculate the AUC, which was subsequently plotted in figure 3B. Figures 3A and B show that protocol I did not induce TEER recovery effects as compared to PMA treatment. A representative example of relative TEER values obtained with protocol II, and the 6h interval used to calculate the AUC are plotted in figure 3C. Here, a significant protection was estab lished, minimizing the decrease in TEER at 6h addition to 15.2 \u00b1 8.8% (P<0.01), whereas induced a 62.3 \u00b1 5.2% (P<0.001) of the initial TEER values. This protective effect was also observed when calculating the AUC (figure 3D). Over the 6h CHAPTER 3.

T84 cells CHAPTER 3.

As the effects of longer chain 21 -fructans did not induce protective effects, ITF III and IV were not included in the TLR2 blocking experiments. Figure 4A and B show representative examples of TEER values as induced by PMA, preincubation with IFT I and ITF II respectively, and pretreatment with the blocking antibody. AUC for a 6h time frame following PMA addition was plotted in figure 4C, showing that pretreatment with TLR2 blocking antibody significantly reduced the short chain 21 -fructan mediated protection for both short chain formulations, with a TEER curve approaching the PMA curve. These results indicate that in T84 cells, TLR2 is involved in the protective mechanism of short chain 21 -fructans against PMA. Figure 4.

AP -1, activator protein activation in HEK hTLR2 reporter cells TLR2 was suggested as a mediator of 21 -fructan signaling in immune cells (15), and in previous studies an important role has been attributed to TLR2 in modulating barrier function (43, 47 -49). To confirm the role of TLR2 in 21 -fructan signaling, HEK hTLR2 reporter cells were incubated with a concentration series of 21 -fructans of different chain lengths. 21 -fructans induce d TLR2 -mediated NF -B activation in the reporter cell line ( Figure 5). Short chain 21 -fructans (I TF I) induced a 2.8 \u00b1 1.2 fold induction (P<0.05) of NF -B/AP -1 activation compared with control, and with increasing mean fructan chain length, the fructans conferred stronger activation, up to 5.9 \u00b1 0.5 fold induction (P<0.05) for the longest mean fructa n chain formulation (ITF IV) as compared to control. These results confirm the role of TLR2 in 21 -fructan signaling and indicate that fructan chain length is an important factor in determining the strength of the TLR2 response. Short chain 21 -fructans conferred a moderate TLR2 activation, whereas the longer chain 21 -fructans induced a relatively strong TLR2 response. CHAPTER 3. TOLL -LIKE RECEPTOR 2 ACTIVATION BY 21 -FRUCTANS PROTECTS BARRIER FUNCTION OF T84 HUMAN INTESTINAL EPITHELIAL CELLS IN A CHAIN LENGTH -DEPENDENT MANNER. 88 Discussion To our best knowledge, this is the first time 21 -fructans have been identified in their capacity as modulators of human intestinal epithelial cell barrier function through TLR2. Proof of principle was established that 21 -fructan dietary fibers can prot ect the integrity of intestinal epithelial cell monolayers. This effect was observed for the shorter chain ITFs (ITF I and II) but not for the longer chain formulations (ITF III and IV). This is in accordance with a previous study in our group, in which ch ain length differences of the applied 21 -fructans were important factors in inducing different effects on human immune cells with regard to cytokine profiles (15). In this study, the short chain 21 -fructans induced a more anti-inflammatory cytokine pattern compared to the longer chain formulations, indicating chain length dependent differences in downstream effects in immune cells. In addition, two studies by Ito et al . performed in rats corroborated chain length depe ndent effects on immune cells as well as intestinal barrier function in vivo. The studies by Ito et al. demonstrated that 21 -fructans stimulated intestinal immune parameters in a chain length dependent manner (50), and that short chain 21 -fructans reduced translocation of endotoxins and bacteria in a TNBS -induced colitis model (51). By using different timing protocols regarding short chain 21 - fructan or PMA treatment we observed a pr otective effect of the fructans on TEER, provided that the cells were incubated with the fructans for 24h, before stimulation with PMA. Treatment with PMA followed by incubation with 21 -fructans did not induce recovery effects, indicating that in this model, fructans exerted protective effects rather than effects on repair processes. This conclusion was based on the described model using low dose treatment. The rationale behind treatment with low dose fructans (100 \u00b5g/ml) was based on our previous results in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (15), where this dose already induced substantial cell activation in the form of production of several cytokines upon 24h of stimulation. In addition, several studies have shown tha t preincubating cells of different tissue types with TLR2 agonists can protect against detrimental effects of barrier disruptive agents or ischemia -reperfusion injury (47-49, 52, 53) . In these studies, protection is often established under low dose stimulatory conditions. With the current study, novel proof of principle was demonstrated for time dependent protective effects of 21 -fructans on ba rrier function of human intestinal epithelial cells. Whether the critical time frame of CHAPTER 3. TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR 2 ACTIVATION BY 21 -FRUCTANS PROTECTS BARRIER FUNCTION OF T84 HUMAN INTESTINAL EPITHELIAL CELLS IN A CHAIN LENGTH -DEPENDENT MANNER. 89 preincubation with 21 -fructans can be reduced as compared to the 24h preincubation protocol while retaining a protective effect remains to be studied. This time frame may give an indication which sort of cellular processes are affected, such as receptor/adapter molecule assembly at the cell membrane, modulation of kinase activity, or further downstream effects such as nuclear translocation of messenger molecules, gene transcription, and protein expression. These results prompt further studies into the exact mechanisms behind the observed protective effects of the fructans on the epithelium. Considering epithelial cells of the intestine specifically, TLR2 is an important player in regulating permeability and thus barrier function (43). The role of TLR2 in the protective action of 21 -fructans on intestinal epithelial cells was confirmed with blocking experiments. In addition, the specific dynamics of 21 -fructan mediated TLR2 activation were demonstrated. Besides possible fructan chain length -, or dose dependent effects on the strength of TLR2 activation i n intestinal epithelial cells, differences in TEER modulation may be due to the ability of TLR2 to heterodimerize with TLR1 (54), TLR6 (54) or TLR10 (55), depending on the stimulus (43, 54) , and the ability to signal together with a spectrum of different coreceptors (56). These features of TLR2 diversify the downstream effects of TLR2, and may provide an explanation for chain length induced differences between the different fructan formulations. The discrepancy between the longer chains inducing strong TLR2 activation but not exerting a protective effect on barrier function, could be due to mechanistic differences in receptor interactions at the cellular surface (15). This type of mechanism has been previously described for TLR4 by Visintin et al. (57). They suggest that differences in agonist clustering mechanisms for TLRs culminate in enhanced signal transduction and different downstream reactions. This is in accordance with our previous observations that inulin -type fructans have different TLR activation patterns (15). We suggest that by activating different numbers of receptors at a time, and at different distance from each other on the cell membrane, long chain 21 -fructans may induce a different cellular response than the short chain 21 -fructans. However an in depth discussion of these pathways is beyond the scope of the present study, and the role of TLR2 dynamics in barrier function is subject of further research in our lab. As an analogue of the endogenous second messenger diacylglycerol, PMA induces activation and translocation of protein kinase C leading to elevated intracellular Ca2+ and modulation of TEER (44). PMA CHAPTER 3. TOLL -LIKE RECEPTOR 2 ACTIVATION BY 21 -FRUCTANS PROTECTS BARRIER FUNCTION OF T84 HUMAN INTESTINAL EPITHELIAL CELLS IN A CHAIN LENGTH -DEPENDENT MANNER. 90 challen ge of T84 cells can be viewed as a simplified model for dietary stimuli (58) or intestinal pathogens (59) involved in modulating PKC signaling and affecting the gut barrier. The read out for TLR2 activation in the HEK reporter cell line was analyzed by the production of SEAP upon NF-B activation. In intestinal epithelial cells, TLR2 activation was shown to acts as an NF -B inhibitor (43). As PMA can also target downstream of PKC -1, stabilization of IB (60, 61) , inhibition of NF - B could be one of the downstream mechanisms by which the epithelial barrier is partially protec ted by the fructans. Although PKC was not studied in our experiments, results from our model suggest that short chain 21 -fructans may interfere in this pathway, by partly inhibiting the cellular response to PMA. Previous studies with inulin have shown that their signaling ca n induce PKC activation in RAW 264.7 cells (60) and in rat distal colonic mucosa (62). However, the typical PKC dynamics are greatly dependent on the type of tissue and the organi sm which is studied (44). Moreover, the PKC family consists of different subclasses and several isoforms, each having distinct dynamics for activation and downstream effects (63-67). A study in T84 cells by Song et al . (68), showed that PMA induced PKC translocation to the apical surface, which was correlated wit h the a decreased TEER. Interestingly, PKC activation has previously been linked to TLR2 signaling cascades in mouse and human dendritic cells (69). In conclusion, 21 -fructans may protect the integrity of the intestinal barrier from damage, by directly binding to TLR2. Since they also have immunomodulating effects and prebiotic effects, they form a promising category of dietary fibers with regard to intestinal health effects, and further studies into their effe cts upon ingestion on physiological, cellular, and molecular level are warranted.

CELLULOSE ALTERS THE EXPRESSION OF NF -B RELATED GENES AND TLR -RELATED GENES IN HUMAN PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS. 98 Abstract Scope: There is renewed interest to apply fibers from root vegetable byproduct for health promoting nutrition. In this study, the immunomodulatory and epithelial barrier effects of cellulose were evaluated. Methods and Results: Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) activation was studied using reporter assays. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated with cellulose followed by microchip gene expression analysis. Resistance of T84 intestinal epithelial cells was measured upon phorbol 12-myristate 13 -acetate (PMA) -induced damage in the presence and a bsence of cellulose. Reporter assays confirmed activation through TLR/MyD88 dependent -, and independent pathways. Cellulose induced upregulation of three NF -B related genes, i.e. cluster of differentiation 40 ( CD40) molecule, interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL - -1 receptor -associated kinase (IRAK1) . Five upregulated genes related specifically to TLR signaling were identified, i.e. interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL -1Ra), interleukin -1 receptor - associated -activated protein kinase 13 (MAPK13). Cellulose did not improve or protect T84 resistance. Conclusion: Cellulose does not directly affect intestinal cell barrier function. However, it alters gene expression in human immune cells and activates TLR and non -TLR related pattern recognition pathways, indicating the immunomodulatory potential of cellulose as major component of root pulp byproduct. CHAPTER 4. CELLULOSE ALTERS THE EXPRESSION OF NF -B RELATED GENES AND TLR -RELATED GENES IN HUMAN PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS. 99 Introduction 4.1 Chicory root pulp and cellulose In the current society, sustainability and health are considered important assets. The health benefits of dietary fibers are becoming more evident, leading to a renewed interest in root pulp byproducts for application in the functional food industry. Root vegetables, such as chicory and sugar beet, are valuable sources of mono -, oligo -, and polysaccharides, which are used in the food and feed industry [1,2] . The oligo -, and polysaccharides are prebiotic fibers, as they can stimulate numbers and activity of intestinal bifidobacteria and lactobacilli upon consumption [3,4] . After extraction of sucrose and fructose, the remaining fraction of these root vegetables can be used as a high fiber livestock feed [5,6] . One of the major compounds of chicory root [7] and beet root pulp [8] is cellulose. This cell wall polysaccharide consists of a linear chain with a varying number of (14) linked D-glucose units with the formula (C6H10O5)n [9,10] . Cellulose is water insoluble and inert to digestive enzymes in the human small intestine [11,12] , but it is better known for its fecal bulking properties and m oderate fermentability in the large intestine, leading to production of short chain fatty acids [13]. Due to these characteristics cellulose can be referred to as a dietary fiber [13]. As several types of dietary fibers induce immune signaling by directly binding to innate immune receptors [14-16], our aim was to study whether cellulose induces si milar effects. By incubating Toll -like receptor (TLR) reporter cells with cellulose, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B)-, and TLR activation as well as TLR/Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88 (MyD88) independent activation was investigated. Peripheral blood mono nuclear cells are often applied as a model to study the immunogenic potential of dietary substances such as probiotics or prebiotics [16-18]. By analyzing cellulose -induced ge ne expression of isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) we aimed to identify genes which are differentially regulated upon direct contact with cellulose. In addition, evidence is emerging that dietary fibers can be beneficial for intestinal epithelial barrier function by activation of certain innate immune receptors of intestinal epithelial cells [19-23]. By analysis of the resistance across T84 human intestinal epithelial cell monolayers we studied whether addition of cellulose could improve the barrier function. Furthermore, a damage model was applied to study possible protective effects. By preincubation of the cel ls with cellulose, we studied whether a phorbol ester -induced decrease in trans epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) could CHAPTER 4. CELLULOSE ALTERS THE EXPRESSION OF NF -B RELATED GENES AND TLR -RELATED GENES IN HUMAN PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS. 100 be prevented or partially inhibited. These experiments were aimed to evaluate whether besides its bulking properties and the stimu lation of SCFA in the intestine, cellulose has the capacity to directly induce activation of immune cells and stimulate or protect the intestinal barrier function. Methods 4.2 Investigational compound As an investigational compound to study the effects of well -characterized and pure cellulose, we used commercially available cellulose (Sigmacell\u00ae highly purified fibers, Type 101, Sigma -Aldrich Chemie B.V., Zwijndrecht, the Netherlands). Cellulose consist s of a linear chain with (14) linked D- glucose subunits, characterized by the chemical formula (C 6H10O5)n [9,10] . An example of a Haworth projection of this molecule is depicted in Figure 1. Endotoxin content (endotoxin units, EU) of cellulose was assessed by Toxikon (Leuven, Belgium) and was 119 EU/g. This concentration has minimal effects on the responsiveness of the applied cell types. 4.3 Ethical statements Isolation of PBMCs from human volunteers was conducted within the University Medical Center Groningen, in the Netherlands. Written informed consent from the volunteers was obtained, and data were analyzed and presented anonymously. This research and consent procedure have been ap proved by the ethical review board of the University Medical Center, Medisch Ethische Toetsingscommissie University Medical Center Groningen, as documented in the approved application ''2007/255''. All clinical investigation was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. 4.4 Cell culture and assays reporter cell lines The following reporter cell lines were acquired from InvivoGen, (Toulouse, France) : THP1 -XBlue SEAP, and deficient in MyD88 activity; Human embryonic kidney (HEK -Blue) cells with inserted constructs for SEAP and human TLR2, and Human embryonic kidney (HEK - Blue) cells with inserted constructs for SEAP and human TLR4. These cell lines were cultured and maintained as previously described [16]. NF-B CHAPTER 4. CELLULOSE ALTERS THE EXPRESSION OF NF -B RELATED GENES AND TLR -RELATED GENES IN HUMAN PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS. 101 Figure 1. Haworth projection of cellulose [87] activity of THP1 cell lines and HEK hTLR reporter cells by 24 h of stimulation with cellulose (dose range 100 \u00b5g/mL - 2 mg/mL) was determined as previously described [16]. 4.5 Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell isolation, culture, and stimulation PBMCs of ten healthy male volunteers were isolated and cultured as previously described [16]. PBMCs were counted using a Z2 cell and particle counter (Beckman Coulter Nederland B.V., Woerden, the Netherlands) and 2 x 106 cells per well were transferred to a 24 wells plate in a total volume of 1 ml per well. A s a model for direct interaction of cellulose with immune cells [16-18], PBMCs were incubated for 24 h (37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2) with a thoroughly homogenized suspension of 1 or 100 \u00b5g/mL of cellulose (Sigma -Aldrich Chemie B.V.), or with normal culture medium, or with 2 ng/mL LPS ( (Escherichia c oli serotype 0111:B4; Sigma B.V.). 4.6 PBMC RNA isolation After stimulation, PBMCs were harvested and transferred to sterilized 1.5 mL eppendorf containers, centrifuged for 5 min at 300 g, resuspended in RNAprotect Cell Reagent (Qiagen, Ve nlo, the Netherlands) and stored at - 20\u00b0C. RNA was isolated using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the following protocol. PBMC suspension in RNAprotect was centrifuged CHAPTER 4. CELLULOSE ALTERS THE EXPRESSION OF NF -B RELATED GENES AND TLR -RELATED GENES IN HUMAN PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS. 102 as described above, supernatant was discarded and cell pellet was homogenized in 350 \u00b5L of 0.143 M -mercaptoethanol / RLT buffer Plus by passing the lysate through a 20 -gauge needle with an RNase -free 5 times. Homogenized was transferred to gDNA Eliminator spin columns and centrifuged for 30 s at 10.000 g. 350 \u00b5L of 70% ethanol was added to the flow -through and samples were mixed by pipetting. 700 \u00b5L of the sample was transferred to an RNeasy spin column and centrifuged for 15 s at 10.000 g. Flow -through was discarded and columns were washed once with 700 \u00b5L of RW1 buffer and once with 500 \u00b5L of RPE buffer with centrifuge steps of 15 s at 10.000 g and discarding flow - through after each centrifugation step. After washing the columns for a second time with 500 \u00b5L of RPE buffer and centrifuging for 2 min at 10.0 00 g, spin columns were transferred to fresh collection tubes and 30 \u00b5L of RNase -free water was directly added to the column membrane. Columns were centrifuged for 1 min at 10.000 g to elute the RNA. RNA quality was checked using an Agilent 2100 bioanalyze r (Agilent Technologies, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). 4.7 Microchip analysis Microchip analysis of PBMC gene expression was performed at the University Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands. cDNA and cRNA synthesis were performed with an Ambion Illum ina TotalPrep -96 RNA Amplification kit (Life Netherlands) following the manufacturer's instructions. PBMC cRNA over 25.000 genes, (Illumina, San Diego, USA). Sample labeling, chip hybridization, and image scanning were performed according to the manufacturer's instructi ons. All arrays met our criteria of the performed quality control. The Bioconductor Lumi package was used for the quality check and normalization of the Illumina arrays [24,25] . The lumiR command was used to load the text -file as generated by the Beadstudio software. The NuIDs were automatically generated upon loading the text -file [26]. The quality was checked by inspecting density plots, boxplots, array -array correlation plots, and the output of the lumiQ command [25]. The normalization procedure was done in 2 steps. First, the Variance Stabilization Transformation (VST) was applied followed by the Loess normalization procedure a s it is available in the lumiN function [27]. The normalized data was used for doing the statistics utilizing the Limma CHAPTER 4. CELLULOSE ALTERS THE EXPRESSION OF NF -B RELATED GENES AND TLR -RELATED GENES IN HUMAN PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS. 103 package [28]. Pathway analysis was performed with Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands). 4.8 T84 cell culture and epithelial cell barrier measurements T84 human colon carcinoma cells (Sigma -Aldrich Chemie B.V) were grown to ca. 80% confluency at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2, in culture medium consisting of 1:1 Ham's F12 medium : DMEM, acquired Scientific, Breda, the Netherlands) and gentamicin (50 \u00b5g/mL, Life Technologies Eur ope B.V.). Cells were maintained as previously described [29]. Trypsin was acquired from MP Biomedicals, Eindhoven, the Netherlands, and EDTA (Titriplex III) from Merck Millipore, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Multiple electrode gold -plated 96 well chamber slides (96W20idf, Applied Biophysics, IBIDI, M\u00fcnchen, Germany) were coated with 300 \u00b5L/well of a 0.2% L -cysteine (Sigma -Aldrich Chemie B.V.) solution in DMEM (Life Technologies Europe B.V.) for 30 min at room temperat ure. Wells were washed twice with DMEM, and coated overnight at room temperature with 300 \u00b5L/well of 1% PureColTM bovine tail collagen (Nutacon Netherlands) and 0.1% BSA (Sigma -Aldrich Chemie B.V.) in culture medium. Wells were then wa shed twice with culture medium and cells were seeded at a density of 2 x 105 cells per well in a final volume of 300 L/well. Prior to stimulation, the cells were maintained in the wells for 14 days to reach a stable TEER, and medium was changed every othe r day. Resistance was measured continuously at multiple frequencies [30] upon placing the chamber slides in an electric cell substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) incubator (Z -Theta model, Applied Biophysics, Troy, New York , USA). Measurements performed at 1000 Hz were used to calculate the area under the curve (AUC), as data acquired at relatively low frequency values specifically represent the tight junction mediated resistance in the 96W20idf plates. To establish whether cellulose exerts protective effects, a damage model was applied based on T84 cell incubation with agent [31]. Briefly , T84 cells were incubated with a concentration series of thoroughly homogenized cellulose in culture medium (1\u00b5g/mL - 2mg/mL) for 24 h, followed by addition of PMA. Cells were maintained in this stimulation medium for 24 h and this time frame was subseque ntly used to calculate the AUC relative to untreated controls. CHAPTER 4. CELLULOSE ALTERS THE EXPRESSION OF NF -B RELATED GENES AND TLR -RELATED GENES IN HUMAN PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS. 104 4.9 Statistical analysis Analysis of the microchip array data was performed using Genespring GX 9 software (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA). Genes were defined as significantly changed when the False Discovery rate q -value of the intensity -based moderated t -statistics was < 0.01 and fold change > 1.2. Statistical analysis of the reporter cell data and the ECIS data was performed by Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. Significant differenc es as compared to control ( p < 0.05) are indicated with an asterisk. Results 4.10 Cellulose activates NF -B via TLR2 and TLR4 To gain insight in the TLR dependency of the effects of cellulose on PBMCs, activation of THP1 and HEK -Blue TLR reporter cells by cellulose was studied ( Figure 2 ). THP1 cell lines express all TLRs [32]. By studying the activation of THP1 MD2 -CD14 cells and comparing this with activation of THP1 DefMyD cells that express a non -functional MyD88, it is possible to determine the TLR dependency of the responses [16]. In TH P1 MD2 - CD14 cells, cellulose induced significant activation of NF -B as compared to control, at the doses of 400 and 2000 \u00b5g/mL (Figure 2A). Subsequently, to confirm whether this NF -B activation was mediated by TLRs, THP1 DefMyD cells were incubated with cellulose. In this cell line also significant NF-B activation was observed as compared to control, suggesting that the activation of NF -B in THP1 MD2 -CD14 cells was partly mediated through TLR/MyD88 -dependent and partly through TLR/MyD88 - independent sign aling (Figure 2B). As TLR2 and TRL4 are recognize dietary carbohydrate and polymers [16,33 -36], we investigated whether NF -B activation by cellulose was mediated via TLR2 or TLR4. To this end, HEK -Blue TLR reporter cells with individual TLR constructs were stimulated with cellulose. As depicted in Figure 2C, cellulose induced statistically signif icant TLR2 -mediated NF -B activation at 400, dose -related pattern of TLR4 -mediated NF -B activation appeared to be biphasic (Figure 2D), with the low doses inhibiting NF -B, and cellulose at a dose of 2000 \u00b5g/mL inducing a small i ncrease in activation (1.2 fold as compared to control, p < 0.05).

PBMC RNA was isolated and hybridized to whole -genome expression microarrays. Quality cont rol of the hybridizations and primary data analysis were performed as previously described [37] to ensure that the array data were of the highest possible quality. The in vitro stimulation of human PBMCs with cell ulose resulted in the differential expression of a number of genes as compared to unstimulated controls. To specifically target genes related to NF -B-, and TLR-signaling, comparisons and pathway reconstruction of these transcriptional networks were made u sing an in silico approach. CHAPTER 4. CELLULOSE ALTERS THE EXPRESSION OF NF -B RELATED GENES AND TLR -RELATED GENES IN HUMAN PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS. 106 Significant changes in expression of 8 genes related to NF -B-signaling and 9 genes related to TLR -signaling induced by cellulose are visualized in Figures 3 and 4 respectively. Within the NF -B pathway, the following 3 genes were upregulated: CD40 molecule (Tumor Necrosis Factor receptor superfamily member 5), interleukin 1 receptor antagonist, and interleukin - 1 receptor -associated kinase 1 . In this pathway, 5 genes were ataxia TLR7 Within the TLR signaling cascade, 5 genes were upregulated by cellulose. These were interleukin 1 receptor antag onist, -1 receptor 3, and mitogen -activated protein kinase 13. The 4 genes which were downregulated by cellulose were CD14 molecule, mitogen -activated protein kinas e kinase kinase 1, TLR5, and TLR7. Results are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. As a positive control for NF -B-, and TLR -signaling, gene expression of LPS -stimulated PBMCs was analyzed. Significant changes in expression of 24 genes related to NF -B-signaling and 19 genes related to TLR-signaling were induced ( Figures 5 and 6). Results are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. 4.12 Results TEER TEER measurements showed that preincubating differentiated monolayers of T84 human intestinal epithelial cells with differen t doses of cellulose did not significantly protect the cells against a PMA -induced decrease in TEER (Figures 7A and B). The 2000 \u00b5g/mL dose appeared to induce a small ameliorating effect, however the AUC was not significantly different from the condition w ith PMA only. Addition of cellulose only to T84 cell monolayers also did not change the TEER as compared to addition of control medium ( Figure 7 ). Discussion In this study, effects of cellulose on immune cells and intestinal epithelial cells were studied to obtain insight into the potential health promoting value of cellulose, as major component of root pulp byproduct. We hypothesized that cellulose can directl y activate immune cells through CHAPTER 4. CELLULOSE ALTERS THE EXPRESSION OF NF -B RELATED GENES AND TLR -RELATED GENES IN HUMAN PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS. 107 TLRs as reported for other dietary fibers [14-16]. However, our results show both TLR/MyD88 -dependent as well as TLR/MyD88 -independent Figure 3.

TLR3 could thus be one of the PRRs which mediated the MyD88 independent NF -B activation as measured in the THP1 DefMyD cells. However, this type of activation could also have occurred through other MyD88 -independent PRRs expressed by the THP1 cells, suc h as c -type lectins [39]. Unfortunately, there are many c -type CHAPTER 4. CELLULOSE ALTERS THE EXPRESSION OF NF -B RELATED GENES AND TLR -RELATED GENES IN HUMAN PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS. 108 lectins and no reporter cells yet to identify their specific ligands. We were able to show that TLR2 and TLR4 are involved. The activation as elicited in TLR2 reporter cells occurred at the doses of 400 and 2000 \u00b5g/mL, and only showed weak activation as compared to the natural pathogen associated ligand (heat killed Listeria monocytogenes ) which was used as a positive control. Compared to activation levels r eported for other fiber ligands such as inulin -type fructans this activation is also relatively weak [16]. However, we still feel that this TRL2 activation can occur in vivo, as in a normal Western diet, the average esti mated daily intake is 3.2 g [40], which could provide concentrations of cellulose in the intestine that are within the range of the applied doses in these experiments. PBMCs are often used to study immune effects of bioactive food components [16,41,42] as they express many PRRs, including TLRs and c - type lectins. The focus of this study was on the analysis of NF -B-related changes in gene expression upon stimulation with cellulose in order to gain insight in the pathways which are activated by cellulose.

Fold induction of up -, and downregulated genes in the NF -B pathway by cellulose . Table 2. Fold induction of up -, and downregulated genes related to TLR signaling by cellulose . Several genes were affected in their expression, demonstrating that cellulose induces transcriptional changes in several innate immune pathways in human PBMCs, as will be discussed below. The differentially regulated genes by cellulose encode molecules of several functional categories. In respective order of strength of induction the upregulated genes within the NF -B pathway were IL-1Ra, CHAPTER 4. CELLULOSE ALTERS THE EXPRESSION OF NF -B RELATED GENES AND TLR -RELATED GENES IN HUMAN BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS. 110 IRAK1, and CD40 . IL-1Ra is an interleukin receptor antagonist, as a secreted isoform from monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and as isoform (icIL - 1Ra1, 2, or 3) [43]. Il-1Ra competitively inhibits IL -1 binding to cell -surface receptors, and the balance between IL -1 and IL-1Ra is important in preventing the development or progression of several inflammatory diseases [43]. IRAK1 is one of two putative serine/threonine kinases that become associated with the interleukin -1 receptor (IL -1R) upon stimulation. It is rapidly recruited by MyD88 to the receptor -signaling complex upon TLR activation [44-46], activation by IRAK4 [47,48] . IRAK1 plays a critical role in initiating innate immune responses against foreign pathogens [49]. CD40 protein is a costimulatory receptor molecule, which is expressed by antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells, and also by T cells [50,51] . It is required for their proliferation [52], maturation [53- 55], and effective immune reactions [54], including induction of and T helper 1 skewing es [52,56] . In addition, CD40/CD40L interaction of CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells is fundamental for induction of CD8+ T cell memory [51,57] . Upregulation of these genes as observed in PBMCs, could thus represent a stimulatory effect on immune status by induction of immune cell recruitment and activation, antigen presentation processes, and subsequent adaptive immune responses. Howev er, not only upregulated but also downregulated genes within the NF -B pathway were observed. A taxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) plays a role in cell cycle delay after DNA damage [58]. It has a broad range of substrates related to DNA repair, apoptosis, G 1/S transition, intra - S checkpoint and G 2/M checkpoints, gene regulation, translation initiation, and telomere maintenance [59]. PIK3cG is involved in inflammatory and allergic responses [60,61] . It is thought to play a role in the regulation of development, proliferation, migration, and function of B cells, T cells, and NK cells [62-64], and controls motility of dendritic cells. Its regulatory subunit, PIK3R1 which was also downregulated, is n ecessary for the insulin -stimulated increase in glucose uptake and glycogen synthe sis in insulin -sensitive tissues [65]. This protein is tightly involved in regulation of PIK3cG in B cells and T cells [66]. Some TLRs were downregulated. TLR5 is an innate receptor which recognizes bacterial flagellin [67], and TLR7 is an innate receptor which recognizes single -stranded RNA in endosomes, represented by viral material which is internalized by macrophages and dendritic cells [68]. Another downregulated gene within the TLR pathway, not yet mentioned in the NF -B pathway is CD14. CD14 protein acts as a CHAPTER 4. CELLULOSE ALTERS THE EXPRESSION OF NF -B RELATED GENES AND TLR -RELATED GENES IN HUMAN PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS. 111 co-receptor, along with TLR4 and MD -2, in the detection of LPS and LTA (lipoteichoic acid) in the presence of lipopolysaccharide -binding protein (LBP) . NF -B-, end TLR - pathways could be part of a negative feedback loop to protect ag ainst overstimulation and unwanted reactions of immune cells [71,72] . As expected because of the stimulatory effect on TLR2 and 4, upregulated genes within TLR -related pathways were observe d. C-Jun, the encoded protein of JUN, combines with c -Fos to form the AP -1 early response transcription factor within the JNK pathway [73,74] . C-jun plays a role in cell cycle progression through the G1 phase and stimulates proliferation [75]. It also exerts an anti -apoptotic effect, by cooperating with NF -B to prevent apoptosis induced by TNF [75]. MAP2K3 is activated by mitogenic and environmental stress, and is regulated by NF - B as a transcriptional cofactor [76]. It can be activated by insulin, and is necessary for the expression of glucose transporter molecules [77], indicating it also plays a role in metabolic processes. MAPK13 is a kinase in the p38 MAP kinase family, which can be activated by proinflammatory cytokines and cellular stress [78,79] . MAPK13 fa ctor ATF2 and the microtubule dynamics regulator stathmin, and it is reported to play a role in differentiation, apoptosis, and inflammatory diseases [80,81] . Upregulation of these ge nes within TLR - related pathways demonstrates that cellulose not only exerts effects on genes which are directly related to innate immune reactivity but also impacts on genes involved in cell cycle regulation and metabolic processes of immune cells. Results from the electrical cell substrate impedance sensing experiments indicate that cellulose does not exert direct barrier stimulating or protective effects in this in vitro model. TLR2 is an important regulator of epithelial resistance, and some dietary fibe rs indeed show barrier protective effects mediated by TLR2 binding [23]. Plausibly, the low binding and activation of TLR2 by cellulose could explain this lack of effect. Despite these results, in vivo studies ind icate that cellulose confers other important protective effects on intestinal health, such as inducing production of SCFAs by the microbiota [13], and the capacity to adsorb a range of dietary carcinogens [82]. Overall, these results show that cellulose is immunomodulating. The expression of several categories of molecules within NF -B and TLR - signaling was stimulated by cellulose, but also several genes within these pathways were downregulated in their expressio n. The activating potential of cellulose could be due to TLR activation and downstream CHAPTER 4.

These results warrant further studies into possible effects of cellulose on TLR/NF -B activation and regulation of expression in vivo, and also implicate that cellulose may not be an CHAPTER 4.

Although further studies are required to assess the functional impacts o f cellulose and root pulp supplementation on the immune system, the immunostimulatory property of cellulose can be an additional health promoting characteristic contributing to the potential application of root vegetable byproduct in the functional food in dustry.

THE IMPACT OF LEMON PECTIN CHARACTERISTICS ON TLR ACTIVATION ANT T84 INTESTINAL EPITHELIAL BARRIER FUNCTION . 124 Abstract Scope Metadata analyses confirm that dietary fibers reduce risk and incidence of disease. This study aimed to investigate underlying structure -response relationships of different degree of polymerization (DP) and degree of methyl esterification (DM) pectins as i mmunomodulatory and epithelial barrier active dietary fibers. Methods and Results . 30DM, 56DM and 74DM lemon pectins were applied to test effects of degree of methyl esterification. Enzymatic digests of these pectins were applied to study the effects of ch ain length modification. NF -B/AP -1 activation was measured TLR and MyD88 reporter assays. The pectins demonstrated TLR dependent activation, and an increasing TLR activation with increasing DM. Pectins induced TLR2, and TLR4 activation, and enzymati c digestion of the polymers into oligomers abrogated their TLR activating potential. Barrier function of human intestinal epithelial cells was quantified by resistance measurements across T84 monolayers. 30DM and 74DM pectins while pectins induced moderate protection of T84 TEER. Conclusion . Activation of immune cells by lemon pectins is TLR dependent through ligation of TLR2 and 4, and the intact polymer backbone is indispensable for activation. Degree of me thyl esterification is a determining factor in activation potential and epithelial barrier protective effects, which is strongest for 30 DM and 74 DM lemon pectins. CHAPTER 5. THE IMPACT OF LEMON PECTIN CHARACTERISTICS ON TLR ACTIVATION ANT T84 INTESTINAL EPITHELIAL BARRIER FUNCTION . 125 Introduction 5.1 Background An important category of health promoting nutritional compounds, which are under extensive study, is that of dietary fibers [1]. Data from meta - analyses confirm that adequate intake of dietary fibers reduces the risk and incidence of diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer [2-5], several gastrointestinal disorders, and obesity [6]. Although dietary fibers have been shown to have a collective health promoting effect, it is largely unknown which chemical properties of which individual fiber are responsible for which of the observed effects. Dietary fibers comprise a spectrum of different molecules from a broad range of plant species, and can also be produced by chemical or enzymatic synthesis such as polydextrose or galactooligosaccharides (GOS) [7,8] . Moreover, within one category of dietary fibers, the physiological responses can differ depending on backbone chain length [9,10] and other physicochemical properties such as the number and the type of side chains [11]. Pectins form a large family of dietary fiber molecules with a range of different structural properties. They are important structural components of plant cells consisting of linear 1,4 --D-galacturonan (homogalacturonan) segments and highly branched rhamnogalacturonan segment [12]. Industrially extracted pectins are used by the food industry as gelling agent. When pectin has more than 50% of the acid units in the backbone methyl -esterified (degree of methyl esterification - DM), it is usually classified as \"high methyl ester (HM) pectin\" [13]. Saponification of pectins will the [14]. Examples of pectin structures with different DM are depicted in Figure 1. Next to the absolute amount of methyl esters present within the pectin molecule, also the distribution of methyl esters over the galacturonan backbone may determine the techno - functional properties [15,16] . As previously shown, the degree of methyl esterification as well a s the chain length of pectin molecules are important factors in inducing different biological effects [17], including effects on the consumer's immune system [18-26]. Up to now these effects on the host immune system were mainly attributed to beneficial effects of t he dietary fibers on the consumers' microbiota. However, recently we have shown that dietary fibers can also have direct effects on immune cells. Several prebiotic fibers CHAPTER 5. THE IMPACT OF LEMON PECTIN CHARACTERISTICS ON TLR ACTIVATION ANT T84 INTESTINAL EPITHELIAL BARRIER FUNCTION . 126 have been shown to directly ligate sensors of the innate immune system, the so -called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) [9,27,28] . Toll -like receptors (TLRs) are the best characterized PRRs and have been shown to be involved in signaling of dietary fibers [9,27,29,30] . We hypothesized that activation of TLRs may be one of the factors involved in the immunomodulatory properties of pectins. To address poten tial structure - function relationships we compared lemon pectins which can be obtained in defined chemical compositions. We investigated the role of chain length and degree of methyl esterification of pectins on TLRs. Also we studied the effects of pectin w ith different degree of methyl esterification on barrier function of human intestinal cells in vitro, as pectins might exert health effects by modulating the intestinal barrier [31,32] . To this end we applied a phorbol 12 -myristate -13-acetate (PMA) damage model to T84 intestinal epithelial monolayers. Methods 5.2 Investigational compounds, enzymatic digestion, and chemical characterization with high performance anion exchange chromatography and high pressure size exclusion chromatography The investigational compounds applied in this study were lemon pectins with different degrees of methyl esterification, i.e. also Figure 1 ). The pectins have been described in detail by Daas et al. (2000) with the codes C30, C55, and C74 respectively. These compounds were applied to investigate structure -function relationships for the degree of methyl esterification. In s ome experiments, the pectins were digested to oligomers to confirm that the biological effects are dependent on an intact backbone of the molecule or whether they can also be achieved by the oligomers. To this end, the pectin substrates (30DM, 56DM and 74D M; 500 mg) were dissolved in 50 mL of 50 mM ammonium acetate buffer, pH 5. The enzymes used were endopolygalacturonase (EC 3.2.1.15) from Kluyveromyces fragilis with U/mL, and pectin lyase II (PL, EC 4.2.2.10), from niger, with an activity of 8.8 added [34] for performed for 10 h, ro tating at 125 rpm at 30\u00b0C. Substrate blanks and enzyme blanks were prepared as controls. Following CHAPTER 5.

Schematic representation of different DM in grey, unmethylated in white. incubations for 10 h, all samples were boiled for 5 min to inactivate the enzymes. Chemicals were from Sigma Aldrich Chemie B.V., Zwijndrecht, the Netherlands. Chemical characterization by high performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) and high pressure size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) of the untreated and treated pectins was performed as previously described [9]. Results of the chemical characterization are shown in Figure 2. 5.3 Cell culture T84 human intestinal epithelial cells were acquired from Sigma Aldrich Chemie B.V. Cells were cultured as previously reporter cell lines, Normocin antibiotic, and selection media were all acquired from InvivoGen, Toulouse, France. Reporter cells were cultured as previously described [9]. Briefly, the THP -1 cell lines were cultured in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS (60 C, 60 min), glucose (4.5 NaHCO 3 (Boom B.V., Meppel, The Netherlands;1.5 g/L), HEPES (10 CHAPTER 5.

THP -1 cell lines were maintained at a concentration of 5*105 cells/mL. After culturing for 3 passa ges, THP1 cell lines were maintained in selection media by adding Zeocin (200 \u00b5g/mL) and G418 (250 \u00b5g/mL) to the THP1 MD2 -CD14 cell culture medium, and by adding Zeocin \u00b5g/mL) and HygroGold (100 \u00b5g/mL) to the THP1 DefMyD cell culture medium. HEK -Blue cells were cultured in DMEM (Life Technologies Europe B.V., Bleiswijk, the Netherlands), supplemented with glucose (4.5 g/L), L mM), 50 mg/mL), and Normocin mg/mL). HEK cells were grown to ca. 80% confluency. After culturing for 3 passages, the HEK cell lines were maintained in selection media by adding 1X HEK -Blue Selection to the culture medium. 5.4 Reporter cell assays To establish whether lemon pectin can activate PRRs, an d more specifically TLRs, TLR reporter cell assays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, THP-1 MD2 -CD14 cells expressing all TLRs were resuspended to a cell density of 1*106 cells/mL, 100 \u00b5L of this cell suspension per well was stimulated for 24 h (37C, 5% CO 2) with untreated and treated pectic compounds (described above), or 100 ng/mL ultrapure E.coli LPS (InvivoGen) as a positive control . Culture medium was incorporated in the assay as negative control. Subsequently 20 \u00b5L of supernatant of the stimulated reporter cells was 180 -1 was the amount of excreted and Quanti -blue color oplate reader Devices GmbH, Biberach an der Riss, Germany) and SoftMax Pro Data Acquisition & Analysis Software.

These cells were resuspended to a density of 2*106 cells/mL and the reporter assay was performed as described above for THP -1 MD2 -CD14 cells, with the exception that the control for MyD88 indepe ndent stimulation of THP1 -DefMyD cells was 25 Tri -DAP (InvivoGen). According to recent literature reports, TLR2 and TLR4 appear to be two main TLRs by which dietary fibers can induce direct cellular activation CHAPTER 5. THE IMPACT OF LEMON PECTIN CHARACTERISTICS ON TLR ACTIVATION ANT T84 INTESTINAL EPITHELIAL BARRIER FUNCTION . 129 [9,37 -40]. Therefore, we next studied the activating capacity of the pectic compounds for activation of TLR2 and TLR4 in reporter cells. HEK -Blue hTLR2 reporter cells were resuspended to a cell density of 2.8*105 cells/mL, and HEK -Blue hTLR4 reporter cells were resuspended to a cell density of 1.4*105 cells/mL. 180 \u00b5L of cell suspension was stimulated for 24 h (37C, 5% CO2) with 20 \u00b5L of the pectic compounds described above , or 20 \u00b5L of culture medium as negative control, or 20 \u00b5L of a suspension of 1*108 heat killed Listeria Monocytogenes cells per ml (InvivoGen ) or 100 ng/mL ultrapure E. coli LPS as positive control. Analysis of NF -B/AP -1 activation was performed as descri bed THP -1 cells . 5.5 TEER of T84 human intestinal cells Epithelial resistance across differentiated monolayers of T84 intestinal cells was determined using gold -plated electrode chamber slides and Epithelial Cell Substrate Impedance Sensing as described previously [36] with some modifications. Briefly, multiple electrode gold -plated 96 well chamber slides (96W20idf, Applied Biophysics, IBIDI, M\u00fcnchen, Germany) were coated with 300 \u00b5L/well of a 0.2% L -cysteine (Sigma -Aldrich Chemie B.V.) solution in DMEM (Life Technologie s Europe B.V.) for 30 min at room temperature. Wells were washed twice with DMEM, and coated overnight at room temperature with 300 \u00b5L/well of 1% PureColTM bovine tail collagen (Nutacon B.V., Leimuiden, the Netherlands) and 0.1% BSA (Sigma - Aldrich Chemie B .V.) in culture medium. Wells were then washed twice with culture medium and cells were seeded at a density of 2*105 cells per well in a final volume of 300 L/well. Prior to stimulation, the cells were maintained in the wells for 14 days to reach a stable TEER, and medium was changed every other day. Resistance was measured continuously at multiple frequencies [41] upon placing the chamber slides in an ECIS incubator (Z -Theta model, Applied Biophysics, Troy, New York, US A). Measurements performed at 500 Hz were used to calculate the AUC, as relatively low frequencies are specifically representative for the tight junction mediated resistance [41]. To establish whether pectins exert prote ctive effects, a damage model was applied based on T84 cell incubation with phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA, 10nM, Sigma - Aldrich B.V.), which is a barrier disrupting agent [42]. were incubated with DM30, DM56, and pectins for 24 h, followed by addition of PMA. Cells were maintained in this stimulation medium for at least 20 h, and this time frame of 20 h was subsequently used to calculate the AUC relative to untreated controls. CHAPTER 5.

Results 5.7 Chemical characterization of lemon pectins The pectins DM30, DM56, and DM74 used in this study have a similar molecular weight (40 -100 kDa) ( Figure 2A -C). All three pectins had a rather random distribution of their methyl esters. To study the effect of size of the pectin molecules, the pectins were degraded by enzymes to oligomeric fragments. Digests were studied with HPSEC and HPAEC (Figures 2 A -D). The 30DM digest after treatment with polygalacturonase consists of saturated GalA oligomers of DP2 -DP20, with 2A, 2D ). The 56 DM polygalacturonase digest was less degraded by the enzyme but still consist s of lower Mw fragments (Figure 2B, 2D ). The digestion was performed by pectin lyase since polygalacturonase is hindered too much by methyl esters in the 74DM pectin. The HPSEC pattern in Figure 2C demonstrates a successful degradation to l ow Mw material. However, due to the working mechanism of the enzyme, mainly unsaturated GalA oligomers of DP2 - DP14 are present in the digest ( Figure 2D ). 5.8 Activation of THP1MD2 -CD14 cells by lemon pectin polymers is dependent on TLR activation To study whether lemon pectins can activate immune cells, culminating in NF-B/AP -1 induction, DM 56 pectin was co -incubated with THP1 MD2 - CD14 cells equipped with a reporter gene. As shown in Figure 3A we observed that pectin activated the THP1 MD2 -CD14 cells with a 4.4 fold - induction (\u00b1 0.19 interquartile range, p < 0.05) as compared to control. Next, we studied whether the induced NF -B/AP -1 activation in the THP1 MD2 -CD14 cells was mediated by MyD88, i.e. the central adapter molecule for TLR signaling. Thi s was done by comparing the activation of the THP1 MD2 -CD14 cells which express all TLRs in CHAPTER 5.

As shown in Figure 4A , the higher the degree of methyl esterification of the pectin polymers, the higher the polymers induced of activation compared to control (\u00b1 0.86 interquartile range, p < 0.05), the 56DM pectin polymers induced a 4.4 - fold induction of activation (\u00b1 0.19 interquartile range, p < 0.05) and 74DM pectin polymers induced the strongest activation, i.e. a 5 -fold induction as compared to control (\u00b1 0.92 interquartile range, p < 0.05). Comparison between the different DM fractions indicated that 56DM and 74DM pectins induced significantly stron ger to 30DM pectins and 74DM pectins trended to induce stronger activation compared to 56DM pectins (p < 0.1). These results show that the structural property of degree of methyl esterification in pectins is an important feature dete -1 activation by lemon pectin requires an intact To determine whether the TLR -mediated NF -B/AP -1 activation by lemon pectin is dependent on its molecular weight or can also be achieved by oligomers of pectins, the degree of polymerization was enzymatically reduced to pectin oligomers. Reduction of the polymer length resulted in loss of TLR activation ( Figure 4B ). The oligomers did not have the same effect as the ful l pectins with an intact backbone, suggesting that backbone chain length is an important factor for the activating potential of these lemon pectins. 5.11 Different DM pectins show different activation patterns of TLR2 and TLR4 Next it was studied whether TLR2 and TLR4 are involved in the activation. TLR2 and TRL4 can recognize polymeric carbohydrates [44-46] and are both implicated in the recognition of dietary fibers [9,37 -40]. Therefore it was investigated whether the NF -B/AP -1 activation by pectins is TLR2 or TLR4 HEK -Blue TLR reporter cells with either human TLR2 or TLR4 constructs were stimulated with concentration series of pectin CHAPTER 5.

As depicted in Figure 5A -D, DM30 pectins only activated TLR2 at the concentrations 200 and 400 \u00b5g/mL, and DM56 pectins only activated TLR2 at the concentrations of 400 and 1000 \u00b5g/mL. In addition, both DM30 and DM56 pectins only induced moderate activation. However, DM74 pectins in duced a relatively strong, and dose dependent TLR2 activation over the whole concentration range tested, reaching a ca. 9 -fold induction of activation at the highest concentration (1000 g/mL, p < 0.05). Figure 6 illustrates that low dosed pectins of diff erent DM, all induced a ca. 4 -fold induction of TLR4 activation, and that upon increase of the dose, only a slight increase in activation was observed as compared to the lowest dose. A subtle DM effect appears to be present suggesting that with increasing DM, pectins induce increased activation, however upon testing for multiple parameters with one -way ANOVA, these differences proved not significant. Taken together, these results demonstrate that high DM pectins can dose -dependently activate TLR2, and can a lso activate TLR4 in a less pronounced manner, and that lower DM pectins can activate both TLR2 and TLR4, but TLR2 activation was much less pronounced as compared to high DM pectins. 5.12 Effect of different DM pectins on TEER of T84 intestinal epithelial cells To study whether lemon pectins protect T84 cells against PMA -induced loss of TEER and whether the DM value is important in TEER modulation, T84 cells were incubated with lemon pectin polymers with a degree of methyl esterification of 30, 56, and 74 , for 24 h. Then PMA was added and the AUC for a 20 -h time period after PMA addition was plotted for the different pectin treatments, as a percentage of the AUC of untreated controls, which was set to 100% ( Figure 7 ). PMA treatment caused a decrease TEER resulting in an AUC of 54.3 \u00b1 3.4% (p < 0.01) as compared to control, confirming that damage was induced to the epithelial barrier. Upon 24 h of preincubation of T84 cells with 100 \u00b5g/L DM30, DM56, compounds conferred PMA -induced resistance with TEER AUC values \u00b1 24.6% (p < 0.05), \u00b1 2.2% (p < 0.05), and 77.6 \u00b1 15.2% (p < 0.05) respectively, as compared to control. These results suggest that 30DM and 74DM pectins confer considerable protection on T84 cells against a PMA -induced decrease in TEER, and that 56DM pectins exert moderate barrier protective properties.

THE IMPACT OF LEMON PECTIN CHARACTERISTICS ON TLR ACTIVATION ANT T84 INTESTINAL EPITHELIAL BARRIER FUNCTION . 137 Discussion The aim of this study was to investigate the structure -function relationship of lemon pectins by studying the effects of DP and DM on TLR -mediated cell activation, and on the barrier function of human intestinal epithelial cells. Since several dietary fibe rs are ligands for innate immune receptors [9,37 -40], we hypothesized that pectins could also be one of the dietary fiber types capab le of activating TLRs, and that this would be one of the mechanisms by which pectins exert their immunomodulatory effects. Upon stimulating a THP1 reporter cell line, which expresses all TLRs, we observed that lemon pectins activate these human monocytic c ells. Neither of the pectin compounds activated the THP1 DefMyD cells, confirming that the observed activity was mediated via TLRs. TLRs mediated immune activation can also explain the in vivo described immune effects of pectin. Immune activating propertie s of lemon pectin have been reported in animal studies which showed that supplementation prevented the induction of oral tolerance to OVA in rats, which was preceded by enhanced protein antigen penetration to the blood and activation of macrophages [47]. Moreover, in that study, lemon pectin enhanced IFN and TNF production by peritoneal macrophages. In a study by Suh et al. [48], a lemon derived pectic -type polysaccharide was orally administered to mice, causing increased secretion of GM -CSF and IL - 6 from Peyer's patches, indicating immune cell activation. Some studies report immunomodulatory effects of the oligomer fractions which remain after enzymatic digestion of pectins [11]. Although these oligomers often only induced immunomodulation in combination with galactooligosaccharides and fructooligosaccharides [49,50] we decided to test such digests for their TLR activating capacities. By incubating THP1 MD2 -CD14 cells with untreated and digested pectin polymers observed that the intact polymers induced NF -B/AP -1 activation, but the digested fractions showed no activating capaci ty. The absence of activation by the digests indicates that the intact polymeric lemon pectin molecules are required for activation, and that the oligomers derived after digestion had lost this property. This suggests that the direct immunostimulatory effe cts of pectins will probably occur in the small intestine, as the pectins are likely to be digested by bacteria in the colon. The importance of the backbone of pectins has been thoroughly reviewed by Popov et al. [11]. In a range of vegetables, the types of pectins were characterized and the effects on immune cells were evaluated. Important CHAPTER 5. THE IMPACT OF LEMON PECTIN CHARACTERISTICS ON TLR ACTIVATION ANT T84 INTESTINAL EPITHELIAL BARRIER FUNCTION . 138 conclusions from the different types of pectins of different origins were that structural differences within pectin subtypes can i nduce different effects on immune cells. More specifically for lemon type pectins, the aforementioned study by Suh et al [48] also confirmed that the intact backbone was necessary for immunostimulatory effects in Peyer' s patches cells, as the hydrolysate of the pectin lost its activating potential. Our experiments subscribe that the intact backbone of lemon pectins is an important structural and functional feature, as it determines the TLR - activating capacity. Next, whe n comparing the untreated polymers with different DMs for their activating potential, we observed that higher DMs were associated with higher activation of THP1 MD2 -CD14 cells. This activating effect for high DM lemon pectins, and inhibitory effect on immu ne cells was previously reported by Popov et al., [51,52] and Chen et al. [51,52] . In the latter study, different DM pectins were studied for their LPS -inhibiting effect on macrophages, and the highest DM pectin demonstrated the greatest inhibition. As the pectins were not studied without the presence of LPS, the intrinsic activation capacity of the pectins themselves was not determined in t hat study. Nevertheless, the inhibitory mechanism suggests that there may be a competitive interaction from the high DM pectins with TLR4. From our results it can be concluded that besides DP, also DM is a structural feature, which plays a role in the immu nomodulatory potential and outcome upon immune cell contact with this particular type of pectins. Subsequently, we studied whether the TLR -mediated activation could be attributed to TLR2 and/or TLR4 by applying the pectin compounds to hTLR2 HEK-Blue TLR4 cells. TLR2 and TLR4 are the TLRs which have so far been identified as innate receptors important in carbohydrate fiber recognition. In addition, for apple pectin an LPS - inhibiting interaction with TLR4 has been reported [53]. As the digests showed no TLR -activating properties in the THP1 cells, only the intact polymeric pectins of different DMs were applied to the HEK reporter cells. We observed that only the higher DM pectins were capable of TLR2 activatio n, but that all pectins, already at low doses, readily activated TLR4. These results suggest that the activating potential of lemon pectins as observed in the THP1 cells could be attributed to both TLR2, and TLR4 activation. Several mechanisms for TLR -medi ated immune modulation pectins can be a TLR4 ligand, pectin could bind to TLR4 and in this way cause competitive inhibition of LPS -mediated activation. Although TLR4 ligation is best known for its stimulating effect on immune CHAPTER 5. THE IMPACT OF LEMON PECTIN CHARACTERISTICS ON TLR ACTIVATION ANT T84 INTESTINAL EPITHELIAL BARRIER FUNCTION . 139 reactions, an d TLR2 is involved in defense against several categories of pathogens, TLR2 ligation can also induce anti -inflammatory responses, depending on its co -signaling molecules and also depending on tissue type or even type of organism [36,54 -56]. In addition, TLRs have been shown to interact strongly with each other's signaling pathways [57,58 ] so the different outcomes in immune modulation by different DM pectins could also be related to the ratio between TLR2/TLR4 activation. TLR2 serves as an an important barrier regulatory receptor [56], and TLR2 liga tion by certain types of fibers can induce beneficial effects on intestinal epithelial cells [36]. Therefore we investigated whether incubation of T84 intestinal epithelial cells with pectins could protect the barrier function against the barrier damaging agent, PMA. In previous studies in our group, the TLR2 -activating capacity of the dietary fibers short chain inulin -type fructans exerted preventive effects against barrier loss in human intestinal epithelial cell s [36], and TLR2 is an important innate immune receptor with a crucial role in intestinal barrier regulation [56]. When we applied PMA to the T84 cells a decrease in TEER was observed, and by preincubating with pectins, this decrease was ameliorated, confirming a protective effect of pectins on epithelial barrier function. In two studies, bacterial infection or NSAID treatment were applied to broiler chicks and cats respectively , as challenge to the intestinal barrier [59,60] . In these studies protective effects of pectin supplementation were also observed regarding intestinal integrity and barrier function [59,60] , suggesting that pectin -mediated protection of the intestinal barrier is not restricted to one damage model and can be beneficial against several toxins or pathogens. In conclusion, DP as w ell as DM are physicochemical properties of lemon pectin which can determine their immunostimulatory properties and therefore may be relevant in the use of pectins for improvement of immune status. The implications of our results for functional food applic ations are that pectin fibers are promising immunomodulatory agents, but that studies into the physiological and more specifically the immunomodulatory effects of pectins should be meticulously designed. The origin, the extraction method, and the full chem ical characteristics such as molecular weight and level and distribution of methyl esters may explain deviating observations for the immunomodulatory effects of pectins and should be included in publications in the future. Ultimately, this will facilitate side-by-side comparisons of reported immunomodulatory effects of all the different types of pectins available, providing an opportunity to develop tailored pectin fortified foods, with CHAPTER 5.

BUT NOT SHORT CHAIN INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS ENHANCE HEPATITIS B VACCINATION RESPONSE IN YOUNG ADULTS. 148 abstract Objective. Inulin -type fructans have shown immune modulation in human cells, cell lines, and in supplemented experimental animals, but this has not been confirmed in healthy, immunocompetent human populations so far. Enhancing vaccination efficacy by supplementing w ith nutritional compounds is an accepted method for studying nutritional immune effects. This study was aimed to analyze the vaccine potentiating effect of inulin -type fructans, and to study whether their degree of polymerization is a determinant in the st rength of the immune response. By analyzing peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets, concomitant changes in these populations may give insight in underlying mechanisms of a stimulated immune response. Design. In this randomized double -blind placebo -controlled supplementation study, 40 healthy volunteers aged 18 -29 (17 males, 23 females), were supplemented for 14 days with inulin -type fructans of DP2 -25 (short chain), or fructose as placebo (n=13, 13, 14 per group , 8 g in single dose per day). On day 7, all volunteers were vaccinated against hepatitis B (Engerix -B). Blood samples were collected at day 0 (basal samples), 7, 14, 21, and 35. Anti - HBsAg titer at day 0, 14, 21, and 35 was analyzed with an Abbot Architec t immunoanalyzer. At all five time points, the percentages of different B cell, T cell, NK cell, and NKT cell populations within the total lymphocyte population and subsets within populations were analyzed using multi - parameter flow cytometry. Results. DP10-60 fructans stimulated the vaccine -specific antibody response at day 35. This was not observed with DP2 -25 fructan. In addition, two responders were identified in the DP10 -60 fructan group vs. no responders in either the DP2 -25 fructan group or the plac ebo group. In the placebo group, but not in the fructan supplemented groups, at day 21, the percentage of IgM+ non-class switched memory B cells was increased as compared to basal samples. In the DP10 -60 group and the placebo group at day 14 and 21, the percentage of transitional B cells was increased compared to basal samples, but not in the DP2 -25 group. The percentage of CD161+ NK cells was increased at day 21 and day 35 for each supplement. In the DP10 -60 group, the percentage of TBET+ Th1 cells was increased at day 35 compared to basal samples. The increase in CD45ROhi cells as percentage of CTLs was not signi ficant in the placebo group, and occurred earlier in time in the DP10 -60 group (day 14) CHAPTER 6. LONG CHAIN INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS BUT NOT SHORT CHAIN INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS ENHANCE HEPATITIS B VACCINATION RESPONSE IN YOUNG ADULTS . 149 compared to the DP2 -25 group (day 35). Finally, the percentage of CD45ROhi cells in the Th population was increased at day 14 and 35 compared to basal samples in the pl acebo group but was not significantly increased in the fructan supplemented groups. Conclusion. This study demonstrates clear structure -effector relationships for dietary fibers in immune responses in humans. In addition, it shows that using less efficacio us vaccination protocols to prove efficacy of food components on immunity may be a more feasible approach than using efficacious vaccination protocols. Finally, it is demonstrates that orally taken bioactive ingredients can influence systemic responses ag ainst pathogens during vaccination . CHAPTER 6. LONG CHAIN FRUCTANS BUT NOT SHORT CHAIN INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS ENHANCE HEPATITIS B VACCINATION RESPONSE IN YOUNG ADULTS. 150 Introduction 6.1 Background Dietary fibers are considered an essential part of healthy nutrition. The health benefits of sufficient fiber intake comprise prevention of colorectal cancer 1, type 2 diabetes 2, cardiovascular disease 3, reduced risk of hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia and hyperglycemia 4 5, and regulation of bowel habit 6-10. Because the role of the immune system in these protective effects is n ot completely clear, t here is a call for evidence of immune modulation by ingestion of dietary fibers in human studies, and for structure -function studies 11 12. Inulin -type fructans are prebiot ic dietary fibers with many health benefits. They are oligomers and polymers of fructose subunits, and often terminate in a glucose molecule 13. Besides the established effects on gut health and metabolism 11 12 14, evidence for immunostimulatory effects of inulin -type fructan consumption is accumulating. Results from ex vivo and in vitro experiments in human cells, cell lines, and from ani mal studies, support the notion that inulin -type fructans exert immune modulating effects. For an extensive overview of these features the reader is referred to a collection of literature reviews 15-19 . The underlying mechanisms for immune modulation by inulin -type fructans have been attributed to the selective stimulation of beneficial bacteria in the intestine, and their SCFA fermentat ion products 17. In addition, previous results from our group support the notion that these fibers can also exert direct effects on immune cells, by activating Toll -like receptors (TLRs) on monocytic cells, and induc ing cytokine production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon in vitro stimulation 20. The degree of polymerization (DP, or chain length) of inulin -type fructans ranges between 2 and 60, and commercial ly available inulin -type fructan powders often contain mixtures of different DP fructans. Interestingly, in our studies the DP of inulin -type fructans proved an anti -inflammatory IL whereas the long chain enriched inulin -type fructans (DP10 -60) produced a more proinflammatory, or immunostimulatory IL -10/IL -12 ratio. In addition, TLR2, which was dose dependently activat ed by the fructans, demonstrated increased activation with increasing average fructan DP. Based on these differences in in vitro direct effects on immune cells, we selected the DP2 -25 fructans and DP10 -60 fructans as supplements to CHAPTER 6. LONG CHAIN INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS BUT NOT SHORT CHAIN INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS ENHANCE HEPATITIS B VACCINATION RESPONSE IN YOUNG ADULTS . 151 study in vivo effects in a human trial. So far, inulin -type fructan supplementation trials which were aimed at boosting the human immune system, commonly target immunocompromised populations such as infants and elderly. We hypothesize that inulin -type fructan supplementation can also be beneficial for healthy immunocompetent populations. A means to study immune modulation is by studying the effects of inulin -type fructan supplementation on building immunity against pathogens such as during an infection or during vaccination, where an immune reaction is evoked without inducing disease. These types of studies are also recommended by regulatory agencies such as the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to prove immune efficacy of food components 21. Up to now, human vaccine efficacy studies with oligo -, or polysaccharide food supplements have mainly been done with efficacious vaccination protocols such as measles 22, tetanus 23, influenza 23 24, or pneumococcal 24 vaccination. Demonstrating efficacy of a food component in these protocols requires high numbers of volunte ers, and effects will always be modest. Vaccines which by themselves do not induce an immediate strong antibody response are to our opinion a more attractive option for application in nutritional immunity studies. Hepatitis B vaccination belongs to this ca tegory. Common vaccination programs use hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) to immunize subjects, and require booster injections to reach protective antibody titers (i.e. above 100 IU/ml) 25. We hypothesize that by su pplementing young adults with inulin - type fructans from 7 days before, until 7 days after the first injection of an HBsAg vaccination program, the antibody response against the vaccine will be improved compared to placebo supplemented participants. This could be represented by an earlier onset of titer development, an increased titer response on the final measuring time point, and/or the presence and number of 'responders', characterized as subjects with titers equal to or above 10 IU/mL. Due to the previou s results in our group mentioned above, we expect that DP10 -60 fructans will stimulate the immune system and enhance the vaccine -induced response as compared to DP2 -25 fructans and placebo. Besides the vaccination efficacy, peripheral blood lymphocyte subs ets of the supplemented subjects were studied using multi -parameter flow cytometry. Concomitant changes in these populations may give an indication of underlying mechanisms of a stimulated immune response and highlight possible differences induced in lymph ocyte populations, related to difference in DP of fructan supplements.

The number of fructose units in the chain (degree of polymerization, or DP) can vary naturally between 2 and 60. Supplement A (Frutafit\u00aeTEX! Sensus, Roosendaal, the Netherlands ), is a natural powdered food ingredient based on chicory inuli n, and known for its texturizing properties. The DP ranges between 10 and 60. Supplement B (Frutafit\u00aeCLR Sensus ), is a powdered fructo partial hydrolysis of chicory inulin. Frutafit\u00aeCLR is a highly soluble food ingredient with a DP ranging mainly between 2 and 25. Supplement C consists of fructose, which is a powdered carbohydrate, and serves as placebo because it consists of the monomer building blocks of fructans and does not have (2 -1) bonds. The DP profiles of suppleme nt A and B are depicted in Figure 1 . Figure 1. DP profiles of supplement A and supplement B. Figure 2. Schematic overview of experimental procedures in time. CHAPTER 6. LONG CHAIN INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS BUT NOT SHORT CHAIN INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS ENHANCE HEPATITIS B VACCINATION RESPONSE IN YOUNG ADULTS . 153 6.3 Volunteers and interventions This study was approved by the ethical board of the University Medical Center Groningen, Medisch Ethische Toetsingscommissie University Medical Center Groningen, and documented in the approved application METC_097. It has been registered in the national Dutch trial register, Nederlands Trial Register (NTR41 644). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and data was analyzed and presented anonymously. Hepatitis B vaccination and blood sampling was conducted within the University Medical Center Groningen, in the Netherlands. All clinical in vestigation was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. A randomized double -blind placebo controlled human dietary intervention trial was designed to study the effect of inulin -type fructans on vaccination efficacy and peripheral blood lymphocyte populations. To study whether the degree of polymerization (DP) o f inulin -type fructans can influence whether different types of immune reactions are stimulated, three groups were included in the study. Healthy volunteers without a history of gastrointestinal symptoms and free of medication , aged 18 -29 (17 males, 23 fem ales), were for 14 days with fructose (Sigma -Aldrich, the Netherlands) as placebo (n=13, 13, and 14 per group respectively, 8g/d in one dose per day), and vaccinated a gainst hepatitis B (Engerix -B, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a, Belgium) on day 7. The volunteers consumed their habitual diet and filled out a nutrition diary for the 35 days of the study. Blood samples were collected at day 0, 7, 14, 21, and 35, see Figure 2 for a schematic overview of experimental interventions. 6.4 Peripheral blood lymphocyte isolation and multi -parameter flow cytometry Multi -parameter flow cytometry was performed to measure percentages of different B cell, T cell, NK cell, and NKT ce ll populations within the total lymphocyte population and subsets within populations. Blood was drawn from the inner cubital vein and collected in 10 mL lithium heparin Vacutainer tubes (BD, Plymouth, UK). All subsequent steps were performed at 4C. Whole blood (1.5 mL) was centrifuged at 2000 g for 15 min, and plasma supernatant was aliquotted and stored at -20\u00b0C for anti - hepatitis B antibody titer analysis. The remaining whole blood was separated into two 50 mL tubes and erythrocytes were lyzed by incubat ing twice with 40 mL of ammonium chloride per tube for 10 min. Cell pellet CHAPTER 6. LONG CHAIN INUL IN-TYPE FRUCTANS BUT NOT SHORT CHAIN INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS ENHANCE HEPATITIS B VACCINATION RESPONSE IN YOUNG ADULTS. 154 was collected by centrifuging for 5 min at 1800 g. After washing the cell pellet twice with 15 mL FACS buffer (2% fetal bovine serum in phosphate buffered saline, FBS in PBS), cells were counted on a coulter counter (Beckton Dickinson, the Netherlands) and 1 x 106 cells per well were transferred to a round bottom 96 wells plate. After pelleting the cells for 5 min at 1800 g and discarding the supernatant, cell pellets were resuspende d in 50 \u00b5l of blocking buffer (20% normal rat serum, Jackson laboratories, in FACS buffer) and incubated for 20 min. Cells were pelleted as described above, resuspended in 50 \u00b5l of extracellular antibody mix consisting of extracellular antibodies, 5% norma l rat serum, and FACS buffer (antibodies are listed in Table 1 -3), and were incubated in the dark for 30 min. After washing the cells which were stained for B cell and NK cell markers, twice with 200 \u00b5l FACS buffer per well, cells were incubated with of FACS -lysing buffer (Beckton Dickinson BV, Breda, the Netherlands) for 30 min. Cells were then washed three times with FACS buffer, resuspended in 200 \u00b5l FACS buffer per well, and stored at 4\u00b0C in the dark until analysis. After incubation with the extr acellular antibody mix, the cells stained for T cell markers were washed three times with 200 \u00b5l of permeabilization buffer (eBioscience, Vienna, Austria) per well. Cells were resuspended in 50 \u00b5l of intracellular blocking buffer (20% normal rat serum in p ermeabilization buffer) and incubated for 20 min. After pelleting the cells as described above and discarding the supernatant, cells were incubated with 50 \u00b5L of intracellular antibody mix, consisting of intracellular antibodies, 5% normal rat serum, and p ermeabilization buffer (antibodies are listed in Table 2), and incubated for 30 min. Cells were washed three times with permeabilization buffer, resuspended in 200 \u00b5l of FACS buffer, and stored at 4\u00b0C in the dark until analysis on an LSR II flow cytometer (Beckton Dickinson BV). The corresponding isotype control antibodies were purchased from the same company as the target antibodies, and isotype stainings were used to set positive gates, using 1 % margins. UltraComp eBeads (eBioscience, Vienna, Austria) we re applied to set the appropriate compensation values for each antibody panel. FlowJo VX software (FlowJo, Oregon, USA) was used to analyze lymphocyte subsets. Basal sampling at day 0 for every individual allowed repeated measures analysis on the flow cyto metry data. Flow cytometry gating strategies are described in Figure 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 . Within the B cell population we used the markers CD19, CD21, CD27, CD38, IgA, IgD, IgG, and IgM to identify na\u00efve non -class switched B cells, class switched memory B cells (IgG+ and IgA+), non -class switched memory B cells, transitional B cells, and plasmablasts/plasma cells. Using CHAPTER 6. LONG CHAIN INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS BUT NOT SHORT CHAIN INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS ENHANCE HEPATITIS B VACCINATION RESPONSE IN YOUNG ADULTS . 155 CD3, CD56, and CD16 as markers we identified NK -, and NKT cells, and within the NK cell population we identified cytotoxic NK cells (CD56+,CD16hi)26 and cytokine producing NK cells (CD56hi,CD16dim CD56hi,CD16-)26. We determined the percentage of CD161+ and CD335+ cells within the cytotoxic -, and cytokine producin g NK cells. CD161 is a cell surface marker which can be present on different subsets of NK cells27. Ligation of CD161 is known to cause activation of Pi3K, PkB, Akt and ERK pathways and is important in the regulation of NK and NKT cell function27. CD335 is a natural cytotoxicity -triggering receptor also known as PCR1 or NKp46 28. We used CD3 and CD8 as markers to distinguish Th cells and CTLs, and within the Th cell population we identified memory cells (CD45RO+), Th1 cells (TBET+), Th2 cells (CD294+), Th17 cells (RoRT+), and FoxP3+ Th cells which may represent regulatory cells. It is generally believed that for the time frame following challenge w ith a virus or a viral vaccine, human CD8+ memory cells are principally found within the CD45ROhi population 29, therefore we also gated and analyzed this population. 6.5 Anti -HBsAg titer analysis Anti-HBsAg titers were analyzed at day 0, 14, 21, and 35. Per sample, 500 l of plasma was aliquotted in Architect tubes (Abbott, Illinois, U.S.A.), and analyzed for Anti -HBsAg titers using an Architect Immunoassay Analyzer (Abbott Diagnostics) following t he manufacturer's instructions.

Within this population, the IgM isotype is used to set a 1% positive gate (S), which is copied to the IgM stained sample to identify the IgM+ non- class switched memory B cells (T). Within the CD19+ population, the CD38 isotype is used to set a 1% positive gate (U), which is copied to the CD38 stained sample to identify CD38+ and CD38hi cells (V). Within the CD38hi population the IgM isotype is used to set a 1% positive gate (W), which is copied to t he IgM stained sample to identify IgMint cells (X*) and the IgMhi transitional B cell population (X**).

Subjects supplemented with DP10 -60 fructans time point T21 (0.6 \u00b1 0.34 IQR) and reached significantly elevated levels at time point T35 compared to basal samples at T0 (2.93 \u00b1 0.75 IQR, p < 0.05). In contrast, in pla sma of subjects supplemented with DP2 -25 fructans or placebo, no increases in antibody titers were observed at T35 as compared to basal samples at T0. Individuals developing an antibody titer against any vaccination, which is above a predetermined thresh old value are indicated as so -called responders, vs. individuals who do not reach titers above this value, which are indicated as non -responders. This threshold value for the anti -HBsAg applied in the present study is generally set at 10 IU/mL 25. There we no responders in the placebo groups and the DP2 -25 fructan group at T35. This was different in the DP10 -60 fructan group in which two responders were present at time point T35. These results combined, demonstrate that supplementing young adults with a daily single bolus of 8 g DP10 -60 fructans in the 14 -day period around the first injection enhanced the efficacy of the anti - hepatitis B vaccination. 6.7 Flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood B cell subsets Peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets of the supplemented individuals were analyzed by multi -parameter flow cytometry to study the effects of different DP fructans. Specifically, we were interested whether changes in T cell, B cell, NK cell, and NKT cell subset s were induced. As B cells are essential in mounting antibody responses against vaccines, we will first describe the results of B cell subsets in peripheral blood of subjects in the experimental groups. The subsets and their corresponding markers of identi fication are summarized in Table 1 , gating strategies are shown in Figure 3 , and results of B lymphocyte flow cytometry are shown in Figure 5. The percentage of B cells within the lymphocyte population was CHAPTER 6.

Na\u00efve non -class switched B cells (Figure 5.II), class switched memory B cell populations (Figure 5.III), and non -class switched memory B cells (data not shown) did not differ in time compared to basal samples as percentage of lymphocytes or B cells. The percentage of IgM+ cells in the non -class switched memory B cell population (F igure 5.IV) was increased for the placebo group at T21 compared to the basal samples (p < 0.05), but in the DP10 -60 group and DP2 -25 group no changes were observed as compared to basal samples. The percentage of transitional B cells and the percentages of plasmablasts or plasma cells did not differ in time as percentage of lymphocytes or B cells (Figure 5.V and 5.VII). However, in the DP10 -60 fructan group and the placebo group, the percentages of IgMhi cells within the CD38hi transitional B cells were sign ificantly increased at T14 and T21 as compared to basal samples (p < 0.05). This effect was absent in the DP2 -25 fructan group ( Figure 5.VI ). 6.8 of peripheral blood NK and NKT cell subsets Human NK cells (CD56+ CD3-) are part o f the first line of defense against viral pathogens and their activation can modulate the outcome of the adaptive immune response 30. Similar to NK cells, NKT cells (CD56+ CD3+) are also implicated in the response a gainst hepatitis B vaccine antigens 30. The subsets and their corresponding markers of identification are summarized in Table 2, gating strategies are depicted in Figure 3, and results of NK lymphocyte flow cytometry are depicted in Figure 6. Within the lymphocyte population and within the NK cell population, the percentages of cytokine producing (CD56hi CD16int) cytotoxic ), and within the cytotoxic and cy tokine producing cells, the percentages of CD161+ and CD335+ cells were analysed. No differences were observed for either cytotoxic or cytokine producing NK cell populations as percentage of the lymphocyte population. In the DP2 -25 group and placebo group (Figure 6.II), an increased effect was observed for CD161+ cytokine producing NK cells at all time points compared to basal samples (T0) but in the DP10 -60 group this effect was only observed on time points T21 and T35 compared to basal samples (p < 0.05). No changes were observed for CD161+ cytotoxic NK cells as compared to basal samples irrespective of the treatment. The percentage of CD335+ cells did not differ in time within CHAPTER 6.

Results of T lymphocyte flow cytometry are shown in Figure 7 . Within the T cell population, we analysed the percentages of Th1 cells, Th2 cells, FoxP3+ Th cells, Th17 cells, Th memory cells, and CTL memory cells. Percentages of Th2 cells, FoxP3+ Th cells, and Th17 cells at T35 did not differ from basal T0 ( 5.II, 5.III, and the of TBET+ (Th1) cells in the DP10 -60 fructan group was significantly increased as compared to basal levels (p < 0.05), but this effect was not observed in the DP2 -25 group or placebo group (Figure 5.I ). Compared to basal samples at T0, the percentage of CD45ROhi CTLs expressed as percentage of CTL memory cells was increased at time point T14 and T35 in the DP10 -60 group (p < 0.05), and at time point T35 in the DP2 -25 group (p < 0.05), but no significant increases were observed in the placebo group ( Figure 5.V ). In a ddition to the CTLs, Th cells also typically demonstrated changes in the CD45ROhi population. However, only the placebo group demonstrated significant increases in CD45ROhi Th cells as percentages of the Th memory population ( Figure 5.VI ), at time point T1 4 and T35 as compared to basal samples at T0 (p < 0.05). DIscussion Previous studies from others and us have shown that inulin -type fructans can impact immunity by either serving as microbiota accessible fiber 17 or by directly binding to immune cells 20, but scientific evidence in humans of related immunological benefits were largely lacking. Building on in vitro results in our studies with inulin -type fructans, we hypothesized that DP10 -60 fructans would stimulate vaccine responses in vivo due to their predominant induction of proinflammatory cytokines in PBMCs, including a relatively low IL -10/IL -12 ratio20, in combination with their strong ability to activate TLR220 31. We observed that supplementation with DP10 -60 fructans significantly enhanced the titer response (T35 of the study) as compared to the DP2-25 fructan supplemented g roup, and that a strong increased trend was present as compared to the titer development in the placebo group. Another observation that supports the immune stimulating effects was the identification of two responders in the DP10 -60 group vs. no responders in either the DP2 -25 group or the placebo group. Inulin - type fructans have been studied in several infant vaccination trials, but in CHAPTER 6. LONG CHAIN INUL IN-TYPE FRUCTANS BUT NOT SHORT CHAIN INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS ENHANCE HEPATITIS B VACCINATION RESPONSE IN YOUNG ADULTS. 166 the majority the fructans were only studied in combination with GOS and/or pectic oligosaccharides. In one study though, lo ng term supplementation with a mixture of oligofructose/inulin, i.e. short chain inulin -type fructans combined with long chain inulin -type fructans, Figure 7.

In this study Saavedra et al. 22 observed an increase in blood IgG levels after m easles vaccination in a 10 study (7/3, 0,2 g/kg BW/d) in -9 months old infants. In a study by Duggan et al. 32 in which 6 - 12 month old infants were supplemented with OF, i.e. only short chain inulin -type fructans (0.7 g/d), no effect was observed on antibody response after vaccination with H. influenza type B vaccine. Strikingly, other studies in infants with prebiotic mixtures did not induce vaccine potentiating effec ts 23 33. It should be noted that the applied fructans in these mixtures are often - if not always - of a short chain nature. Although this body of evidence is still relatively small, it is tempting to speculate that the DP10 -60 fructans are indeed more suitable to apply for the purpose of potentiating vaccination programs. Dietary fibers can differ substantially in their molecular composition, and even within categories such as inulin -type fructans, different effects on the body and microbiota can be elicited15-19. To study the effect of different DP of fructans on change s in peripheral lymphocytes, we analyzed B cell -, T cell -, NK cell, and NKT cell subsets of supplemented individuals for their percentage of the total lymphocyte population, percentage of relevant subpopulations, and for differences in activation marker ex pression. Class -switching is one of the hallmarks of activation and maturation of B cells. If the peripheral blood is representative for the immune responses occurring after the vaccination, the increased titer response at T35 would be expected to coincide with a decrease in na\u00efve B cells, and increases in transitional B cells or even plasma cells36. The percentage of transitional B cells which are in the process of maturation (CD38hi IgMhi) was significantly increased in the DP10 -60 group and the placebo g roup for time points T14 and T21 compared to the basal samples but not in the DP2 -25 group. Increased percentages of this population indicate that B cells are activated and stimulated to differentiate into antibody producing plasma cells, which is a functi onal objective of vaccination. The fact that this population was stimulated by DP10 -60 fructan supplementation and not by DP2 -25 fructan supplementation underscores the effective differences of these two supplements. The induction of memory B cells is impo rtant for the ability to mount an efficient secondary immune response and protection against infection upon encountering the relevant antigen36. In the non - class switched memory cells, the percentage of IgM+ cells was slightly increased for the placebo gro up at T21 compared to basal samples while the fructan groups did not. It is possible that the chosen time points for CHAPTER 6. LONG CHAIN INUL IN-TYPE FRUCTANS BUT NOT SHORT CHAIN INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS ENHANCE HEPATITIS B VACCINATION RESPONSE IN YOUNG ADULTS. 168 sampling are too early after vaccination to observe the induction of B memory cells36 and that these cells arise after the 35 day period. NK and NKT cells did not demonstrate clear supplement dependent effects, suggesting that B cells and especially T cells may be more involved in the boosting of the vaccination response via dietary inulin supplementation, or that B cell and T cell effects m ay be better detectable in peripheral blood. Supplementation with DP10 -60 fructans induced striking differences in T cell populations in time, the increased titer response for the long chain group on T35 was associated with an increased percentage of (TBET+) Th1 cells compared to basal samples. Contrary to Th1 cells, (CD294+) Th2 cells did not change in time for either treatment. These results suggest that in the DP10 -60 group, a shifted Th1/Th2 balance may have been induced which was skewed towards Th1 cell responses. These results are corroborated by literature reports mentioned in several reviews 15-19, which subscribe that inulin -type fructans can shift the balance towards Th1 reactions instead of Th2 mediated responses. Although the in vitro results from our group 20, and others 34 led to expect increased Treg percentages at T35 in the DP2 -25 group as compared to the DP10 -60 group and the placebo group, no changes in regulatory T -cell populations were observed. Future vaccination studies may also include regulatory B cells in flow c ytometry analysis, as these cells may also play a role in the success or absence of anti-HBsAg vaccination responses 35. It would be interesting to study whether these Bregs are stimulated by short chain inulin -type fructans as opposed to the Tregs which did not show increases in this study. Th17 populations also showed no changes in time or differences due to treatment. The induction of memory cells is important in the efficacy of vaccinations, as these cells a re responsible for fast recognition of a second encounter with the relevant antigen and mounting an adequate immune response 36. The results indicate that both fructan treatments stimulate the induction of memory C D45ROhi CTLs but the placebo did not. On the other hand, the CD45ROhi Th cells were only enhanced in the placebo group at T35. It would be interesting in follow up studies to also include CD45RA and CCR7, to study the transitions into T cell memory or effe ctor cells in more depth 37. The fact that we observed clear differences for the different DP compounds suggests that DP is an important factor which determines the reaction of immune cells in the body. This could b e explained by several mechanisms. Upon consumption, inulin -type fructans of different DP may selectively stimulate different populations of the microbiota 38-40, and CHAPTER 6. LONG CHAIN INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS BUT NOT SHORT CHAIN INULIN -TYPE FRUCTANS ENHANCE HEPATITIS B VACCINATION RESPONSE IN YOUNG ADULTS . 169 these different populations could influence the immune system either in a stimulating or an attenuating manner 41. In addition, short chain fibers could be fermented into different products than long chain fibers, thus inducing different SCFA profiles in the intestine, qualitatively and quantitatively 17. However, most effects of SCFA on the immune system are attenuating 42, contrary to the imm une stimulation results observed in the current study. It is more likely that the effects are the result of the sum of indirect and direct effects on immune cells in the intestine 17 19 20. It is a striking that an oral supplement can stimulate a systemic response to an intramuscular vaccination, and this warrants further studies into the way this process of antigen uptake and presentation can be impacted by orally taken supple ments. Generally, the antigens of an intramuscular vaccination such as the applied hepatitis B vaccination, are thought to be detected by circulating dendritic cells, which then recruit other immune cells and migrate towards a draining lymph node, where an tigen is presented to B -, and T cells followed by a primary immune response 36. Because of the natural surveillance function exerted by DCs, they circulate through the body and mount immune responses against antige ns which are encountered. Ligation of innate immune receptors on DCs followed by antigen presentation toward effector cells, such as B cells, T cells, and NK cells locally, or in specialized lymphoid structures could be a mechanism which explains the induc tion of pro - and anti -inflammatory cytokines as observed in many prebiotic studies. Due to the fact that DCs can 'sample' the gut lumen 43 and they are migratory cells 44, they are one of the candidate cell types to mediate dietary fiber -induced immune effects occurring in the periphery. In conclusion, this is the first in vivo study which demonstrates a structure -function relation of a dietary fiber on a human immune response. We demonstrate that events in the gut by supplementing with a dietary fiber, have consequences for systemically induced changes in the immune system. The in vivo immunostimulatory potential of long -chain enriched inulin -type fructans subscribes an important nutritional health claim that these fibers can be beneficial for the immune system. Finally we feel that the use of a low efficacy vaccination model such as Hepatitis B may be more instrumental to demonstrate immunological effects of a nutritiona l supplement than the very efficient vaccination models 22 23 32 33. These human studies can be done with relatively low numbers of subjects and stil l with a high statistical power. CHAPTER 6.

GENERAL DISCUSSION AND FUTURE PERSPETIVE. 176 In a society in which the average lifespan is ever increasing, the importance of reaching old age in good health is evident. In this concept, well being is a natural result of healthy ageing, but there is also a large socio -economic advantage to be gained by reducing the annual health care costs. Nutrition is a very important component which can contribute to a healthy ageing process . Current opinions voice the essential role of sufficient fiber content in the daily diet to protect against a range of diseas es. Although a collective health improving or protecting effect of different types of fibers is described, the individual mechanisms by which these types of fibers exert their health effects remain to be elucidated and warrant mechanistical studies into th e individual structure -response relationships of different fiber types. The effects on the immune system are suggested to play an important role in dietary fiber mediated health effects. As a vital component of the body, the immune system is responsible fo r homeostasis by defending the body against pathogens. In addition, it is charged with the duty of maintaining a peaceful co -existence with the commensal microorganisms located in our intestines. The intestines can be considered as the most important immun ological organ of the body as it harbors around 70 percent of our total immune cell population. It is constantly active in analyzing the status of the gut lumen by screening for 'good' or 'bad' signals in the form of commensal microbiota species vs. pathog enic organisms and toxins. Besides through continuous action of specialized immune cells, a tightly interconnected monolayer of epithelial cells prevents the external environment of the lumen from protruding into the surrounding tissue of the lamina propri a. Continuous leakage of luminal content into surrounding tissue and into the periphery due to a defective epithelial barrier is an unwanted phenomenon, called 'leaky gut syndrome'. Several diseases have so far been linked to a leaky gut, and it is expecte d that more will follow, indicating the importance of maintaining the epithelial barrier function for disease prevention. Functional foods like prebiotic dietary fibers are aimed at stimulating a healthy gut microbiota composition by selectively stimulatin g lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, which coincides with stimulating host health. In addition to the well -known indirect health effects via these bacteria and their SCFA products, we propose that there is a third mechanism by which dietary fibers can cause immune modulation, i.e. by directly activating membrane receptors on intestinal immune cells and epithelial cells. In this thesis, the call for mechanistic studies on individual fiber types and their direct effects on the immune system and intestinal cell barrier function is addressed. In order to study CHAPTER 7. GENERAL DISC USSION AND FUTURE PERSPETIVE. 177 relevant parameters, first a technology platform needed to be established, which was done by using a well -studied type of dietary fiber, i.e. chicory root derived inulin -type fructans. After the extraction p rocess of these fibers from chicory, the remaining root pulp is mainly used as a high fiber livestock feed. Due to the increased interest in dietary fibers, cellulose and pectins, two major fibers from this byproduct, were also studied using the establishe d technology platform to evaluate their health effects for the potential use in functional food products. 7.1 Direct immunomodulatory effects of inulin -type fructans In Chapter 2 we demonstrate for the first time the proof of principle that inulin -type f ructans directly activate immune cells. We found that signaling is dependent on the TLR adapter molecule MyD88, and therefore that this type of signaling is mediated via TLRs. In particular, TLR2 demonstrated dose -dependent activation upon cellular stimula tion with inulin -type fructans, suggesting that this most important TLR by which inulin -type fructans induce immune signaling. Strikingly, the higher the average chain length of the formulation, the stronger the TLR2 response as measured by NF -B ac tivation. Although receptor studies specifically aimed at dietary fibers are still scarce, PRRs appear to be involved in these type of interactions, probably mimicking their responsiveness towards oligo -, or polysaccharides which occur in the form of patho gen associated molecular patterns. Examples of these interactions known so far are beta -glucans which are recognized by dectin -1 and complement receptor 3, and also cause immune modulation [1], beta - galactosides which are recognized by Mannose macrophages recognizing mannan oligosaccharides -sign which binds to Lewis Antigen glycans [4]. Broadening screening experiments by including these additional receptors and more types of dietary carbohydrate polymers and oligomers will provide additional information in future dietary fiber studies on their direct immunomodulatory properties. Blocki ng of TLR2 on human PBMCs was performed to study whether TLR2 was the most important receptor inducing the IL -10/ IL -12 cytokine responses in these cells (results not shown); however, the results showed much interindividual variation in the induced cytokin e pattern, suggesting that the interactions of fructans with PBMCs could be more complex as compared to THP1 cells. PBMCs comprise several very different cell types, therefore a suggestion to get a better insight into the effects of fructans on individual cell types, may be to use cell sorting to CHAPTER 7. GENERAL DISCUSSION AND FUTURE PERSPETIVE. 178 first separate the cell types and evaluate the induced immune effects per specialized cell type. 7.2 Direct immunomodulatory effects of other chicory root dietary fibers To address whether other dietary fibers are also capable of activating PRRs, we studied cellulose ( Chapter 4 ) and pectins ( Chapter 5 ), which are two major components of chicory root pulp. We found that both fiber types induced NF -B activation in THP1 cells, but the activation by cellulose was part ly mediated through TLR/MyD88 -dependent and partly through TLR/MyD88 -independent signaling pathways. Other PRRs expressed by the THP1 cells and also signaling to NF -B are likely to cause the TLR -independent effects and require further mechanistic studies. Candidate PRRs to study would be in the categories of C -type lectin receptors, RIG -like receptors, galectins, and other innate immune receptors known to interact with carbohydrate polymers and oligomers. The activating capacity of cellulose in itself was striking however, as many researchers apply cellulose as a placebo under the assumption that it is an inert compound which passes through the gastrointestinal tract without affecting the intestines. In follow up of these unexpected results, we performed a microchip array and identified several genes in the NF -B-, and TLR pathways which were modulated in human PBMCs upon stimulation with cellulose. Subsequent reporter experiments also confirmed TLR2 -mediated NF -B activation as well as a - related pattern of TLR4 -mediated NF -B activation. Compared to inulin - type fructans, the TLR activation by cellulose could be categorized as moderate, but these results show promise for further experiments and the set up of chicory derived cellulose supplement ation studies. The activation by pectins did prove to be fully MyD88 -, and TLR - dependent, as the pectins induced no activation of the applied MyD88 deficient THP -1 cell line. Contrary to cellulose, pectins have been studied extensively for their health pr omoting and immunomodulatory effects, but also for pectic compounds the structure -function relationships and actual target receptors were not fully elucidated so far. Depending on their structural properties, pectins were capable of mounting a TLR2 respons e similar to long chain inulin -type fructans, indicating a strong and specific interation with this receptor. Pectins induced moderate TLR4 activation, however this was much less pronounced as compared to the activation of TLR2 and may have been due to int erference of residual endotoxin traces in the original compound. On the other hand, if endotoxin is not selectively digested by the applied enzymes then the CHAPTER 7. GENERAL DISC USSION AND FUTURE PERSPETIVE. 179 complete abrogation of activation of THP1 cells by the pectins strongly suggests that the TLR4 acti vation as observed in the HEK cell lines was in fact not endotoxin related. To make a general statement about TLR4 activation by pectins, a broader range of pectin types should be studied, and the endotoxin content of the applied fibers should be carefully measured and documented in future studies. Ongoing experiments comprise characterization of immune and barrier effects of the remaining dietary fibers of which chicory root is comprised, such as the hemicellulose xyloglucan and acetylated pectins, to reveal the full potential of individual chicory root pulp components, and also encompass the study of the chicory root pulp when it is applied as a whole in a nutritional supplement. 7.3 Structure -function relationships: Chain length We aimed to elucidate whether and which structural properties of chicory root dietary fibers can modulate cellular immune responses ( Chapter 2 ). One of these structural properties is fiber chain length. Upon studying inulin -type fructans, a specific chain length -dependency of i mmune responses was demonstrated, as the short chain -enriched inulin -type fructans induced a high, anti -inflammatory IL -10/IL -12 ratio in human PBMCs and the longer the average chain length of the inulin -type fructan formulation, the lower this ratio. A po ssible explanation for the difference in IL -10/IL -12 ratios can be deduced from our TLR reporter assays. Chain length -induced differences in activation, as observed in the experiments with inulin -type fructans, might be due to mechanistic differences in receptor interactions at the cellular surface by clustering smaller or larger numbers of the relevant receptors on the membrane, thereby creating a molecular complex which enhances signal transduction or alters the downstream outcome. This clustering mechani sm has been described for LPS, clustering substantial numbers of TLR4 [5] and may be a relevant mechanism for other TLRs as well. A second explanation for the observed differences may be the interacting capacity of inulin -type fructans with cell membrane lipids in the membrane which was studied by Vereyken et al. [6]. Strikingly, the dynamics of these interactions are also chain length - dependent [7-9], and it may therefore be a plausible mechanism to explain different signaling outcomes. Another explanation for differences in TLR2 -mediated signaling can be that TLR2 is known to be a promiscuous receptor which can partner with a spectrum of different co -receptors [10]. As a consequence, the outcome of TLR2 activation can be highly dependent on the type of co -CHAPTER 7. GENERAL DISCUSSION AND FUTURE PERSPETIVE. 180 receptor which is involved [10]. Two important co -receptors of TLR2 are TLR1 and TLR6, which are both present on the HEK reporter cells which were applied in our studies, as well as on human PBMCs. Activation of TLR2 which is dimerized to TLR1 is considered to induce mostly pro - inflammatory signals [11], where as the activation of TLR2 which is dimerized with TLR6 is more likely to induce an anti -inflammatory response [12]. The applied reporter assays in our studies are based on PRR-mediated NF -B activation because NF -B is an essential transcription factor involved in TLR -mediated innate immune responses against pathogens [13,14] . As such, the activation of NF -B is a reliable read out for TLR -mediated activat ion. Nevertheless, TLR2 is also known in some cases to not only activate NF -B, but also other transcription factors, including cAMP response element (CREB), which is involved in IL -10 expression [15,1 6]. Our results tend to suggest that short chain inulin -type fructans induce NF -B but also other, more anti -inflammatory transcription factors, and that long chain inulin -type fructans destinctly and very strongly activate NF -B in particular. Future s tudies with immune cell transcription factor screens of in vitro stimulated cells could provide confirmation of this explanation. Although quite specific mechanistic results were already acquired, at the same time these results call for further biochemical characterization of the interactions and dynamics of inulin -type fructans with membrane receptors and lipids. Literature reports regarding chain length dependent effects on the immune system or barrier function induced by other dietary fibers are relativ ely scarce. Oligosaccharides, which can be characterized as relatively short chain dietary fibers are often studied for their prebiotic and allergy -preventing properties in infants. The general idea behind the application of oligosaccharides in infant nutr ition is to mimic the oligosaccharides which are present in breat milk, as these are strongly involved in the stimulation of a healthy intestinal microbiota and development of the immue system in infants. Oligosaccharides can be derived from a range of dif ferent backbone structures. Galactooligosaccharides (GOS) for example are often supplemented in a combination with inulin -type fructans and with or without (acidic) pectin oligosaccharides (pAOS). The typical mixture often applied in baby formula is compri sed of a 9:1 ratio of GOS [17], which are short chain fibers with a DP ranging from 3 to 10, and long chain inulin, which ranges up to DP60. Since the allergy preventive effects of these infant supplements are aimed at stimulating the maturation of the immune system through beneficial bacteria, and skewing it into a relatively more Thelper1 oriented direction CHAPTER 7. GENERAL DISC USSION AND FUTURE PERSPETIVE. 181 and away from Thelper2 reactions which are allergy related [18,19] , it would be highly interesting to know whether besides through prebiotic action, the TLR2 stimulation of immune cells and epithelial cells of infants is also involved in this beneficial skewing effects of dietary fibers, and inulin -type fruct ans in specific. 7.4 Structure -function relationships: Methyl esterification In the study of pectins we applied commercially available lemon pectins to confirm the principle of immunomodulatory properties of pectin (Chapter 5). In addition, these pectins are well characterized for their structure which is a linear backbone with different percentages of attached methyl groups. Literature on pectin -induced health effects describes that the amount and type of molecular groups este rified to the pectin backbone are of particular importance in determining the outcome of pectin challenges [20]. The observations that low DM (DM30) pectins only activated TLR2 at moderate concentrations, and high DM (DM56) pectins only activated TLR2 at higher concentrations confirm that pectin -induced activation is very sensitive to different experimental circumstances as also demonstrated and discussed by Popov et al. [20]. In addition, both DM30 and DM56 pectins only induced moderate activation, whereas DM74 pectins induced a relatively strong, and dose dependent TLR2 activation over the whole concentration range tested. When a comparison is drawn with the inulin -type fructan r esults for the strength of TLR2 activation and the anti -, or proinflammatory effects on the immune system, literature on pectin studies corroborated our results such that high DM pectins are generally characterized as immunostimulatory and low DM pectins t end to have immunoregulatory or anti -inflammatory properties [21]. A single study of pectins including cytokine analysis in pectin -stimulated PBMCs demonstrated opposite effects [22], suggesting that for a solid consensus more in vivo and in vitro experiments may still be required, however all circumstances of pectin experiments such as applied dose, duration of stimulation etc. should be carefully controlled, documented, and repor ted, as pectin studies can be very susceptible to these factors in changing the outcomes [20]. Other structural features of pectins which have been described in literature as an important determinants of the induced e ffects are the degree of acetyl groups attached to the pectin backbone or \"Degree of Acetylation (DA)\", the branching and type of branches attached to the backbone, and also the molecular charge and acidity of the pectins [20]. These characteristics are interesting to include in future structure -response studies of pectins. Finally, to fully understand CHAPTER 7. GENERAL DISCUSSION AND FUTURE PERSPETIVE. 182 the benefits of actual chicory root pectins for health, a detailed pectin content -, and structure profile of chicory r oot pulp is required as reported in the studies of Daas et al. [23,24] , and ultra -pure pectin isolates of chicory can then be evaluated for their immunomodulatory and barrier protective effect s using the technology platform we have described. 7.5 Barrier protective effects and TLR2 ligation With the activation of TLR2 by dietary fibers in mind, and considering that TLR2 is an essential molecule for the regulation of a proper intestinal barrie r function [25], we hypothesized that dietary fibers confer protection on intestinal epithelial cell barrier function via Toll -like receptor 2 (TLR2). We studied whether chain -length and methylation differences influenc e this process. I nulin -type fructans exerted time -dependent and chain length -dependent protective effects on the T84 intestinal epithelial cell barrier mediated via TLR2. These results suggest that TLR2 located on intestinal epithelial cells could be a tar get of dietary fiber -mediated health effects through modulation of the intestinal barrier function. For this particular type of fiber, the short chain formulations actually proved efficient in barrier protection whereas the long chain inulin -type fructans showed little or no protection against PMA. The effects on barrier function relating to different degree of methyl esterification (DM) of pectins were not as straightforward; 30DM and 74DM pectins induced a strong barrier protective effect, whereas 56DM pe ctins induced only moderate protection of T84 TEER. Cellulose was also included in these ECIS experiments, however it did not exert any effects on T84 barrier function. Results of these three fiber types raise the question why moderate activators of TLR2 s uch as short chain inulin -type fructans would protect the barrier function, but stronger TLR2 activators in the form of long chain inulin -type fructans did not show this effect. Moreover, as a moderate TLR2 activator, cellulose would be expected to induce protection, which was not observed. And finally, both low DM as well as high DM pectins protected the barrier function. For now, the only explanation for these apparently contradictive outcomes is that there are fundamental differences in the way these fib ers interact with the cellular receptors and that they show very distinctive and compound -specific effects. Further mechanistic studies are required to explain these differences in barrier protective properties or lack thereof. CHAPTER 7. GENERAL DISC USSION AND FUTURE PERSPETIVE. 183 7.6 Human studies: Innate and adaptive immunomodulatory effects of inulin -type fructans At the commencement of the first experiments documented in this thesis, The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) described the status quo of inulin -type fructans as certainly being a prebiotic funct ional food, but that more studies were required to provide scientific evidence of related health benefits. Currently, anno 2015, the property of stimulating beneficial microbiota is supplemented with an accepted health claim stating that native chico ry inulin beneficially effects blood glucose levels and bowel habit, but specific claims regarding stimulation of the immune system still require more scientific evidence and more studies are highly recommended. This evicence should comprise the stimulatio n of a functional parameter such as stimulation of vaccination efficacy. To address this call for in vivo evidence of immunomodulatory effects of inulin -type fructans we designed a human supplementation study with the aim to confirm these effects (Chapter 6). The observed IL -10/IL -12 ratios suggested that application of short chain inulin -type fructans would be most suitable in situations which call for anti -inflammatory regulation of immune responses, and that supplementation with long chain -enriched inuli n-type fructans would be suitable for applications where the immune system needs to be boosted in its response to pathogens. We hypothesized that long chain enriched inulin -type fructan supplementation in the critical 14 day period around the first injecti on of an anti -Hepatitis B surface antigen vaccination would be able to boost the adaptive immune responses against this vaccine. Evidence confirming this hypothesis was best observed at the final sampling time point T35, which was 35 days after the start of fiber intake, 28 days after receiving the vaccination, and 21 days after the final supplement intake. Anti -HBsAg titers in plas ma of supplemented subjects confirmed that in the long chain enriched inulin -type fructan group, the titer response was significantly enhanced as compared to short chain inulin -type fructans, and showed a clear increased trend (p=0.01) as compared to the p lacebo group. Moreover, the category of responders, i.e. subjects with an antibody titer above 10IU/mL counted two subjects in the long chain inulin -type fructan group vs. no responders in the placebo group or the short chain -enriched inulin -type fructan g roup. Inulin -type fructans have been studied in several infant vaccination trials, but in the majority the fructans were only studied in combination with GOS and/or pectic oligosaccharides. In one study though, long term supplementation with a mixture of o ligofructose/inulin, i.e. short chain inulin -type fructans CHAPTER 7. GENERAL DISCUSSION AND FUTURE PERSPETIVE. 184 combined with long chain inulin -type fructans, enhanced vaccination responses. In this study Saavedra et al. [26] observed an increase in blood IgG levels after measles vaccination in a 10 week supplementation with OF/inulin (7/3, 0,2 g/kg BW/d) in 7 -9 months old infants. In a study by Duggan et al. [27] in which 6 -12 month old infants were supplemented with OF, i.e . only short chain inulin -type fructans (0.7g/d), no effect was observed on antibody response after vaccination with H. influenza type B vaccine. Strikingly, other studies in infants with prebiotic mixtures did not induce vaccine potentiating effects [28,29] . It should be noted that the applied fructans in these mixtures are often - if not always - of a short chain nature. Although this body of evidence is still relatively small, it is tempting to speculate that the long chain inulin -type fructans are indeed more suitable to apply for the purpose of potentiating vaccination programs. To relate our findings of increased antibody titers to changes in peripheral lymphocytes, we analyzed B cell -, T cell-, and NK cell -subsets of supplemented individuals for their percentage of the total lymphocyte population, percentage of the relevant subpopulations, and for differences in activation marker expression. Supplementation with long chain inulin -type fruc tans induced striking differences in T cell populations in time, the increased titer response for the long chain group on T35 was associated with an increased percentage of TBET+ Thelper1 cells compared to basal samples, and this percentage was also signif icantly increased compared to all time point measurements of the placebo group. Although increased in time, at T35, the percentage of CD294+ Thelper2 cells was smallest in the long chain enriched inulin -type fructan group, compared to the short chain enric hed inulin -type fructan group, and placebo group. These results suggest that in the long chain group a shifted Th1/Th2 balance was induced which was skewed towards Th1 cell responses. These results are corroborated by literature reports mentioned in Chapte r 1, which demonstrate that inulin -type fructans can exert stimulation of Thelper 1 reactions and prevent Thelper2 mediated allergic responses. The induction of memory cells is important in the efficacy of vaccinations, as these cells are responsible for fast recognition of a second encounter with the relevant antigen and mounting an adequate immune response [30]. The perce ntage of memory CD45ROhi Th cells was increased for the long chain inulin -type fructan group as well as for the placebo group at T35, but not for the short chain inulin -type fructan group. Although the in vitro results from our group described in Chapter 2 , and CHAPTER 7. GENERAL DISC USSION AND FUTURE PERSPETIVE. 185 results from literature [31] led to expect increased Treg percentages at T35 in the short chain inulin -type fructan group as compared to the long chain inulin -type fructan group and the placebo group, no changes in regulatory T -cell populations were observed. Th17 populations also demonstrated no changes in time or differences due to treatment. Thus, long chain inulin -type fructans as well as the placebo stimulate Th memory cells, but this result could also be regarde d from a different viewpoint, in the way that the induction of Memory cells was actually inhibited in the short chain group. The significant increase in Thelper1 cells appears to be the parameter which can be linked directly to the increased vaccination reponse as it was significantly increased compared to both the short chain group and the placebo group. Changes in B cell populations were significant, but not as straightforward as for the T cell populations. Class -switching is one of the markers indicatin g activation and maturation of B cells. Strikingly in the B cell compartment, the percentage of IgM+ cells indicating the non -class switched memory B cell population was decreased for the long chain group at T35 compared to basal samples. Upon class switch ing, B cells can become IgD- and IgA+ or IgG+. And although no significant changes were observed for the total class switched IgD- subpopulation in the long chain group and the placebo group, the relative contribution of IgG+ cells within the IgD- populati on in fact were increased for the long chain enriched inulin -type fructan group at time point T21 as compared to basal samples. Finally, the percentage of transitional B cells which are in the process of maturation (CD38hi IgMhi) was significantly increas ed in the long chain group and the placebo group for time points T14 and T21 compared to the basal samples but not in the short chain group. Increased percentages of this population indicates that B cells are activated and stimulated to differentiate into antibody producing plasma cells, which is one of functional objectives of vaccination. The fact that this population was stimulated by long chain supplementation and not by short chain supplementation is a strong evidence of the effective differences of t hese two supplements. NK and NKT cells did not demonstrate clear supplement dependent effects, indicating that B cells and especially T cells are more involved in the boosting of the vaccination response via dietary inulin supplementation. Future vaccinati on studies may also include regulatory B cells in flow cytometry analysis, as these cells may also play a role in the success or absence of anti -HBsAg vaccination reponses [32]. It would be interesting to study whether these Bregs are stimulated by short chain CHAPTER 7. GENERAL DISCUSSION AND FUTURE PERSPETIVE. 186 inulin -type fructans as opposed to the Tregs which did not show increases in this study. We observed clear results from this human study, and long chain inulin -type fruc tans are now established to have in vivo immunostimulatory properties in humans. This pioneer study can provide important clues for further studies into the mechanisms how long chain inulin -type fructan supplementation leads to potentiation of the response against the hepatitis B vaccine. Generally, the antigens of an intramuscular vaccination such as the applied hepatitis B vaccination, are thought to be detected by circulating dendritic cells, which then recruit other immune cells and migrate towards a dr aining lymph node, where antigen is presented to B -, and T cells followed by a primary immune response [30]. The exact mechanism by which inulin -type fructan supplementation boosts this process remains to be studie d, but can include effects on the gut microbiota and SCFA, as well as effects on dendritic cells circulating through the intestine and the periphery. Because of the natural surveillance function exerted by DCs, they circulate through the body and mount immune responses against antigens which are encountered. Ligation of innate immune receptors on DCs followed by antigen presentation toward effector cells, such as B cells, T cells, and NK cells locally, or in specialized lymfoid structures could be a mech anism which explains the induction of pro - and anti -inflammatory cytokines as observed in many prebiotic studies. Due to the fact that DCs can 'sample' the gut lumen and they are migratory cells, they are one of the candidate cell types to mediate dietary fiber -induced immune effects occurring in the periphery. The role of dendritic cells in these processes are still to be confirmed, which should start with in vitro culture of cell lines which are differentiated into cells with a dendritic phenotype and analysis of the effects of inulin -type fructans on the cytokine production, the antigen presentation potency of these cells towards effector cells and the skewing of effector cell responses. In addition, barrier measurements in vivo are neccesary to corrobora te the statements made in Chapter 3 ; these experiments are relatively easy and non -invasive for test subjects, as they can be performed by means of lactulose -mannitol tests during dietary supplementation trials. These tests are highly recommended for futur e dietary fiber supplementation studies. 7.7 Future perspective The studies presented in this thesis demonstrate that chicory root dietary fibers exert direct effects on immune cells and intestinal epithelial cell CHAPTER 7. GENERAL DISC USSION AND FUTURE PERSPETIVE. 187 barrier function. We demonstrate that no t only the primary product of chicory root, i.e. inulin -type fructans, posses valuable nutritional value but that this also holds true for fiber components of the remaining chicory root pulp after extraction of the inulin. Moreover, the effects of inulin - type fructans do not only comprise modulation of innate immune responses but can range as far as adaptive responses in the periphery. We describe a technology platform of in vitro studies and human studies which can be applied for future evaluation of benef icial effects of many more dietary fibers, or other nutritional compounds of interest.

GENERAL SUMMARY. 192 Current consensus on a healthy diet is that sufficient daily dietary fiber intake can protect us from developing several diseases. The exact mechanisms by which this protection occurs are currently unknown but the effects on the immune system are suggested to play an important role. In addition to the indirect immun e effects elicited by lactid acid bacteria and their SCFA products, we propose that there is a third mechanism by which dietary fibers can cause immune modulation, i.e. by directly activating membrane receptors on immune cells and epithelial cells. Althoug h a collective health improving or protecting effect of different types of fibers is described, the individual mechanisms by which these types of fibers exert their health effects remain to be elucidated. The studies described in this thesis were aimed specifically to identify and characterize direct effects of different dietary fibers from chicory root. The acquired knowledge of chicory root dietary fibers can be applied in designing a healthy daily nutritional regimen and provides us with the tools to design chicory -derived functional foods for specific immune boosting purposes. Chicory root has been known for its high content in one of the best characterized prebiotic fibers, inulin -type fructans. Chapter 1 provides a literature overview of the immune mediated health effects of inulin -type fructans . From studies that applied these fibers in colon cancer, chronic inflammatory diseases, vaccination efficacy, and prevention of infection and allergy, a large bo dy of evidence with a range of immunomodulatory effects was gathered . These fructans are potent immunomodulating food components that hold many promises for prevention of disease. Recommended for future studies on immunological effects of inulin -type fruct ans and other dietary fibers is that the choice of immune markers is correlated with the particular condition that is being assessed, and the relevant clinical end -points should be clear. In case of patient studies, it should be mentioned whether immune ma rkers are differentially expressed in disease and control populations . Due to the lack of experimental evidence, studies aimed at identifying direct effects of immune modulation through activation of gut DCs or other gut -residing immune cells are warranted. We hypothesize that by ligating receptor s of the innate immune system such as TLRs , and NODs, dietary fiber supplementation can have substantial effects on the intestinal as well as the peripheral immune s ystem. In addition, dietary fibers may also ligate PRRs expressed on gut epithelium, which could influence its barrier function. CHAPTER 8. GENERAL SUMMARY. 193 In Chapter 2 we describe that inulin -type fructans exert direct signaling upon contact with immune cells, and we discuss the r ole played by TLRs and NODs in this process . Human PBMCs were studied as model immune cells as they express many PRRs including TLRs and NODs. These PBMCs were stimulated with four inulin -type fructan formulations with different chain length profiles. Not only direct activation was observed by significant production of cytokines upon stimulation, but also that the produced cytokine patterns were dose -, and chain length dependent. Strikingly, short chain enriched inulin -type fructans induced a regulatory cytokine balance compared to long chain enriched inulin -type fructan s as measured by higher vs. lower IL- 10/IL -12 ratios respectively. TLR reporter cell experiments demonstrated that fructan -induced signa ling is highly depe ndent on TLRs and their adapter MyD88 . From the follow up experiments in reporter cells overexpressing a single type of PRR per cell line, we concluded that TLR2 was prominently activated, while TLR4, 5, 7, 8, and NOD2 were mildly activated. These results indicate that inulin -type fructa ns indeed possess direct signaling capacity on human immune cells , and that this activation is dose -, chain length -, and predominantly TLR2 dependent . TLR2 is an important receptor involved in intestinal barrier homeostasis. The observation that TLR2 is prominently involved in inulin - type fructan recognition prompted us to investigate whether these fibers improve or protect the epithelial barrier function. We hypothesized that receptor interactions with TLR2 on the epithelial surface are involved in inuli n-type fructan mediated barrier modulation and that fructan chain length is also a factor which determines the effect on the epithelium . In Chapter 3 we demonstrate a model for disrupted b arrier function using PMA, which causes a considerable decrease in TEER. TEER is a parameter studied as a measure for tight junction -mediated barrier function. Short - chain inulin -type fructan s strongly attenuated the PMA -induced decrease in TEER, whereas long chains did not exert protective effects. These findings confirm ed that chain length is a clear determinant in experimental outcome in these barrier studies. Timing also proved en essential factor in the protective capacity as no effect on recovery was observed during addition of the fructans when PMA was applied fir st. By blocking TLR2 with an antibody , the protective effect of short chain inulin - type fructans on barrier protection was abrogated, which confirm ed the involvement of TLR2 in barrier modulation by inulin -type fructan s. Thus, in addition to ligating TLR2 an d modulating cytokine expression in immune CHAPTER 8. GENERAL SUMMARY. 194 cells, inulin -type fructan s exert time -dependent and chain length - dependent protective effects on the T84 intestinal epithelial cell barrier mediated via TLR2. These results suggest that TLR2 located on both intes tinal epithelial cells as well as immune cells could be a target of inulin -type fructan -mediated health effect s in vivo. Proof of principle studies confirmed direct mechanisms for inulin - type fructans in model cell types , and the established technology platform was then applied to study different fiber types. Because of renewed interest to apply fibers from chicory root byproduct (pulp) for health promoting nutrition , two major root pulp components, cellulose and pectins, were studied. In Chapter 4 the immunomodulatory and barrier modulating capacity of cellulose is described . The transcriptome of cellulose -stimulated PBMCs was studied by gene chip array and barrier function measurements were performed with human intestinal epithelial cells. Reporter assays confirmed activation through TLR/MyD88 dependent -, and independent pathways. Cellulose induced upregulation of three NF -B related genes, i.e. cluster of differentiation 40 ( CD40) molecule, interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL receptor -associated kinase . Five upregulated genes related specifically to TLR signaling were identified, i.e. interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL -1Ra), interleukin -activated protein kinase 13 (MAPK13). Cellulose did not improve or protect T84 resistance. From these experiments we concluded that cellulose does not directly affect intestinal cell barrier function. However , it alters gene expression in human immune cells and activates TLR and non-TLR related pattern recognition pathways, indicating the immunomodulatory potential of cellulose as major component of root pulp byproduct. In Chapter 5 pectin, was studied for its immunogenic and barrier protective effects , as this is another major component of chicory root pulp . In addition, since pectins can differ in their chain length but also in the degree of methyl esterification, this was also studied as a structural feature, to evaluate possible structure -response properties of this molecular characteristic. Due to the lack of standardized commercially available chicory root pectin, and the similarity of the pectin profiles which can be extracted from lemon, these lemon pectins were studied as model pectins. Stimulation of TLR reporter cells with lemon pectins with different CHAPTER 8. GENERAL SUMMARY. 195 degrees of methyl esterification ( 30DM, 56DM and 74DM ), demonstrated TLR dependent activation, and an increasing TLR activation with increasing DM. The applied p ectins induced TLR2 activation , and moderatel the polymers we found that this treatment abrogated their TLR activating potential. In experiments testing the b arrier function of h uman intestinal epithelial cell, 30DM and 74DM pectins induced a strong protective effect, while 56DM pectins induced moderate protection of T84 TEER. From these experiments we can conclude that a ctivation of immune cells by lemon pectins is TLR 2 dependent , and may also involve TLR4 ligation, and that the inta ct polymer backbone is indispensable for activation. Besides in activation potential , the d egree of methyl esterification is also a determining factor for epithelial barrier protective effects , which were strongest for 30DM and 70DM lemon pectins. Buildin g on the collected in vitro results in our studies with inulin - type fructans, we hypothesized that the long chain -enriched inulin -type fructans would stimulate vaccine responses in to their predominant induction of proinflammatory cytokines, inclu ding a relatively low IL -10/IL -12 ratio, in combination with their strong ability to activate TLR2. In Chapter 6 we describe the results of a human hepatitis B vaccination and supplementation study with different inulin -type fructan supplements. By comparing the effects of long chain fructan supplementation with short chain fructans and a placebo group on anti- HBsAg titer development in the 28 days following the first injection we observed that supplementation with long chain fructans significantl y enhanced the titer response (T35 of the study) as compared to the short chain supplemented group, and that a strong increased trend was present as compared to the titer development in the placebo group. Another striking observation was the identification of two responders, i.e. with a titer above 10 IU/mL plasma, in the long chain fructans group vs. no responders in either the short chain or the placebo group. Flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets of the supplemented individuals demonstrated that the increased titer response for the long chain group on T35 was associated with an increased percentage of TBET+ Thelper1 cells compared to basal samples, and was also significantly increased compared to all time point measurements of th e placebo group. Although increased in time, at T35 the percentage of CD294+ Thelper2 cells was smallest in the long chain enriched inulin -type fructan group, compared to the short chain enriched CHAPTER 8. GENERAL SUMMARY. 196 inulin -type fructan group, and placebo group. These results suggest a shifted Th1/Th2 balance for the long chain group towards Th1 cell responses. Strikingly in the B cell compartment, the percentage of IgM+ cells in the non -class switched memory B cell population was decreased for the long chain group at T35 comp ared to basal samples. And although no significant changes were observed for the total class switched IgD- subpopulation in the long chain group and the placebo group, the relative contribution of IgG+ cells within the IgD - population in fact were increas ed for the long chain enriched inulin -type fructan group at time point T2 1 as compared to basal samples. Finally, the percentage of transitional B cells which are in the process of maturation (CD38hi IgMhi) was significantly increased in the long chain gro up and the placebo group for time points T14 and T21 compared to the basal samples but not in the short chain group. NK and NKT cells did not demonstrate clear supplement dependent effects, indicating that B cells and especially T cells are more involved in the boosting of the vaccination response via dietary inulin supplementation. In conclusion, t his study confirms the in vivo immunostimulatory potential of long chain enriched inulin -type fructans, and subscribes an important nutritional health claim that these fibers can be beneficial for the immune system. The conclusions of this thesis are discussed in Chapter 7 . 197 198 199 Nederlandse samenvattingNEDERLANDSE SAMENVATTING. 200 van de te 'samplen' om van het darm lumen monitoren door onderdeel van komen proefschrift zijn er met name op gericht om direct e effect en van verschillende voedi worden rol die TLRs en NODs spelen in het l Myeloid differentiation primary is dit proces rol speel t in dat van PMA, humane T84 darm epitheel cellen die en tevens gemedieerd via ul, interleukin 1 receptor associated dagen na he opzichte van IgM+ cellen in de non -class switched memory B cel populatie op T35 significant verlaagd in de ze groep vergeleken met de basaalmonsters.

Floor, 2010 fijn om iemand in de buurt te hebben die al wat verder in het onderzoekstraject was en het klappen van de zweep kende. Swapnil, it took some getting used to your direct way of speaking, but you were a nice colleague to have worked with, with your own unique humor . I hope you are doing well back in India, all the best to you. Eelke, jij was een goeie toevoeging blik hebben we het voorwerk studie kon het goed Toen nood af te jij me echt uit de brand geholpen . Neha, I've gotten to know yo u as a hard wo rking and very smart colleague. I enjoyed talking with you about the fibers we were working with , and discussing how they might interact with the cells we were applying them to, or just simply chatting away during our work in the cell culture room . I was honored by your invitation to attend your wedding in India, it was an amazing experience, thank you so much for letting me be a part of this milestone in your life. I would also like to thank you and Marlies for being my paranimfs , it is nice to be able to share this milestone with you!

APPENDICES 217 Curriculum Vitae Leonie Marloes Vogt was born in Delfzijl, T he Netherlands, on the 18th of August 1983. In 2001 she graduated from high school (Dollard College) and started her studies in Biology at the University of Gr oningen. She obtained her Bachelor's degree with the specialis ation Medical Biology in 2004. During her Masters in Biomedical Sciences she performed her first research project at the Cell Biology Department of the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) studying the impact of different extracellular matrix proteins on the remyelination capacity of oligodendrocytes, which play an important role in multiple sclerosis. Her second research project was performed at the Medical Biology division of the UMCG, du ring which she studied the molecular pathways which are induced in immortalized B cells by Rituximab , a therapeutic which is applied in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Her final Master project was performed in the group of Dr. Marijke Faas and Prof. dr. Paul de Vos, studying the differences in adhesion to and activation of monocytes and endothelial cells by syncytiotrophoblast microparticles (STBM) of healhy pregnant versus preeclamptic women. After finishing with a colloquium on the potential of cigarette smoke components in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease s, she obtained her Master degree in winter 2009 . After a three month interim position as a teacher of Physics at the Fivel College in Delfzijl, she started a PhD project on dietary fibe rs and intestinal health, in the Medical Biology division of the UMCG under supervision of Prof. dr. Paul de Vos. This project was performed in collaboration with Wageningen University, TNO, and Cosun/Sensus, as a workpackage within the Carbohydrate Compet ence Center. "}
