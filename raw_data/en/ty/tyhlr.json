Our little girl just turned a year old. Thinking back to the years we struggled with conceiving a child and carrying one to term, I thank God every day for this girl and that she lived. Not only did she survive the pregnancy, she arrived healthy and perfect and is such a blessing. We were patients of Dr. Mersol-Barg's for 18 long roller-coaster hope-filled tear-filled months. Before working with Dr. Mersol-Barg we had tried unsuccessfully to have a child for six years which included two miscarriages. With my 40th birthday arriving, I knew we needed help. Entering the realm of fertility treatments was a whole new world and we had no idea what we were getting in for. There were lots of tests and car rides back and forth, lots of blood draws, some shots, lots of ultrasounds, some medications, multiple surgeries, but always the nurses and staff greeted us with compassion and carefully walked us through each step. They held my hand and even prayed for me when I asked. And Dr. Mersol-Barg always greeted us with hugs and always took time to carefully explain our situation, our options, the biology and physiology of what was happening. He took all the time necessary to make sure we were comfortable and understood everything. Living those 18 months was emotional, sometimes exhausting, filled with hope and caution, our mantra became \"hope for the best and expect the worst\" because it was difficult to have hopes dashed again and again, never knowing how the story would end. I always understood very clearly that our story did not have a guaranteed happy ending. After two more miscarriages and I think four attempts at IVF, we finally received word that I was pregnant and we held our breath as week by week our girl continued to grow and develop. We held our breath so hard, we almost dared not move until she was born nine months later. With tears of joy and appreciation we brought her to meet Dr. Mersol-Barg and staff. It was their care, support, and tender tenacity that saw us through the maze of treatments and gave us the precious gift of our sweet girl. Our hearts will always "}
