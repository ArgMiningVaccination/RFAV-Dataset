CULLMAN, JR. INSTITUTE FOR PATIENT EXPERIENCE SUMMER 2016 VOLUME TWO ISSUE 3 On May 3 and June 14, the Joseph F . Cullman, Jr. Institute for Patient Experience hosted two summits for employees who supervise staff in the medical practices. The summits were designed to provide the tools, techniques, and resources necessary to excel as medical practice leaders. More than 150 staff members attended. Sandra Myerson, MBA, MS, BSN, RN, CPXP , Senior Vice President and Chief Patient Experience Officer, Mount Sinai Health System, said, \"Perhaps one of the most challenging aspects of a leader's role is to be an effective coach\u2014inspiring staff to be their best, provide feedback in a meaningful and productive way, and engage all members of the team to work together toward a common goal.\" Ms. Myerson noted that the summit's objective was to introduce participants to coaching approaches that will inspire high performance, mindfulness, and compassion in the workplace, and to build strong teams.Cullman Institute Hosts Patient Experience SummitPatient Experience Summit Participants Summit participants provided many comments: \"I really enjoyed the interactive sessions. It made the members of the table and audience in the room communicate and interact better with others.\" \"I enjoyed the mindfulness and stress sessions for self-preservation.\" \"I will use the Dream Team exercise to strengthen teamwork in my medical practice.\" \"As a leader it is often difficult to give up control. I learned I can listen without always having to respond.\" \"All the material was relevant and useful.\" \"I learned different ways to motivate my team.\" \"I now have a better appreciation of the patient's perspective.\"This edition of the Patient Experience Newsletter is once again filled with outstanding and heartwarming examples of how employees across the Mount Sinai Health System are caring for patients with compassion, empathy, and creativity. I am grateful to all of you who make it your mission to provide the best experience possible for our patients. As we continue to strive for excellence (as determined by our patients), staff and physicians throughout the organization are working to enhance, improve, and refine their verbal and non-verbal communication skills - practicing with each other so key phrases that convey compassion and active listening become routine, and displaying \"on stage\" behaviors that produce a warm and welcoming environment. And, just as developing clinical or technical competency requires education, practice, coaching, and feedback, so does the art of effective and compassionate communication. This edition of the Newsletter includes a photomontage of Ambulatory Care supervisors and managers who attended our Patient Experience Summit, which was dedicated to enhancing their ability to provide meaningful feedback and coaching so that employees become proficient in verbal and non-verbal communication best practices. I encourage all employees to seek feedback from your manager so you know what you are doing well, and where you have opportunities to improve your communication skills so that patients feel your empathy and compassion for them. No need to wait for your annual evaluation! Ask for feedback regularly! Your interactions with patients, and with each other, determine whether patients feel we care about them as human beings, or if we think of them as just another diagnosis. How well we connect with patients\u2014really listen to them, hear their concerns, and understand their motivations\u2014has a direct impact on their clinical outcomes and long-term health. And the bonus? When we make that connection with our patients, we feel better! It's a win-win! So, as you move through your day, remember to smile, make eye contact, and say \"hello!\" to everyone you see, and take a moment to connect with your patients and their family members. Our patients will appreciate that, and so will you! I continue to be inspired by the level of commitment and passion across the organization to provide our patients with the best experience possible. I appreciate all you do, every day, to make Mount Sinai the best place for patient care. Thank you!

However, there is nothing quite as powerful and transformative as rewarding staff on the spot, or \"catching someone in the act\" of providing excellent care and service. In that moment, all involved are eyewitnesses to powerfully positive behavior. That is the essence of \"Catch a Star,\" a program developed by the MSQ Patient Experience Committee in 2014. \"The feedback from many managers was that it took too long, and required too much paperwork, to identify staff excellence,\" said \"Catch a Star\" co-chair Chet Ostrowski, Director of Food Service, MSQ. With this program, all of the managers have \"Catch a Star\" cards. A manager simply puts the employee's name on the card and hands it back with a lapel pin proudly identifying the employee as a Mount Sinai Queens Star, and why the employee is a \"star.\" The manager then calls or sends an email to Human Catching Staff in the Act... Of Doing Something Right Resources, which sends the staff member a personalized invitation to a luncheon with MSQ Executive Director Caryn A. Schwab to share ideas and suggestions about how to improve services. \"It's inspiring to hear and share stories about staff who go the extra mile to create great patient experiences,\" said Ms. Schwab. \"'Catch a Star' acknowledges and rewards behaviors that we can all learn from. Outstanding customer service is contagious.\" \"There were 82 stars in 2015 and the hospital hosted three celebrations to honor them. Their names and pictures were posted on our new electronic information screens all over the hospital,\" said \"Catch a Star\" co-chair Norma Calame, Director of Human Resources, MSQ. \"Rewarding moments of helpfulness and compassion shine a light on how all staff can have a positive impact.\" The Mount Sinai Hospital followed MSQ's lead and instituted a \"Catch a Star\" Breakfast with the President in 2015. David Reich, MD, President and Chief Operating Officer, The Mount Sinai Hospital, and senior operational leaders present a \"Catch a Star\" pin and an invitation to a monthly breakfast to 20-25 staff members a month. Dr. Reich said, \"The 'Catch a Star' Breakfast is by far my favorite meeting of the month. It gives me an opportunity to thank staff for their service and learn from our star employees what we can do to make Mount Sinai even better.\"David Reich, MD, and the Breakfast with the President/Catch A Star May 11th recipients.

The PXI focuses on providing a framework to support development of the patient experience field in conjunction with its sister organizations, The Beryl Institute and Patient Experience Journal. The PXI now provides full and formal certification of patient experience professionals through a rigorous examination. This recently instituted certification exam incorporates the extensive and comprehensive knowledge developed via The Beryl Institute's patient experience community and the Patient Experience Body of Knowledge. Certified Patient Experience Professional (CPXP) certification is an international designation intended for health care professionals with a commitment to and interest in patient experience improvement. The examination development process adheres to the Standards for Education and Psychological T esting (AERA, APA, & NCME, 2014) and Standards for the Accreditation of Certification Programs (NCCA, 2014). Achievement of certification highlights a commitment to the profession and to maintaining current skills and knowledge to support and expand the field of patient experience. Four Mount Sinai Health System members sat for the new CPXP exam in April, and all four are now CPXPs: Y osuke Chikamoto, PhD, Director, Center of Excellence in Physician Communication; Luann Donnelly, Patient Experience Improvement Coach, The Cullman Institute; Sandra Myerson, MSHS Chief Patient Experience Officer; and Erica Rubinstein, Senior Director Patient Relations and Service Recovery, MSHS. For additional information about the CPXP , go to www.pxinstitute.org.On June 14, the Mount Sinai West Patient T ransport team gathered to celebrate recent groundbreaking success in their patient experience outcomes. After months of stagnant patient experience scores, the team set their sights on a significant goal\u2014to reach a mean score of 89.5 percent for the inpatient survey question, \"Rate the person who transported you around the hospital.\" The changes they put in place and the culture of teamwork they developed not only helped them attain this goal; they also made significant improvements on key measures such as Time from T ransport Called to Patient Picked Up. Sophia T roiano, Regional Manager, Patient Experience for Compass One Healthcare, which manages transport services for MSW, said, \"The employees I interacted with felt a greater sense of purpose and described themselves as 'caregivers who save lives.' They truly have a shared vision of excellence.\" The team also was inspired by patient experience heroes in their midst, including Phil Heyward, a patient transporter whose recent quick action and communication skills played a pivotal role in saving the life of a patient in cardiac arrest. \"The entire team at Mount Sinai West feels deep gratitude for, and pride in, our patient transport colleagues,\" says Rubiela Guzman, Mount Sinai West Director of T ransport Services.

People who transported me & people who cleaned room were extraordinarily courteous & kind, as were nurses & doctors.6 Acute hospitalization can precipitate transient and short-term insomnia in patients, triggering the prescription of sedative hypnotics. Illness, medications, change in nighttime routine, and the sleep-disruptive nature of the hospital environment can cause insomnia. Both insomnia and the drugs used to treat it can contribute to delirium, a risk factor for falls, restraint use, increased length of stay, and increased incidence of hospital complications. Poor sleep can lead to a poor patient experience. In a recent study by an interdisciplinary research project team, hospitalized older adults were treated with a non-pharmacologic nurse-driven sleep protocol, which led to a decrease in the use of sedative-hypnotic medications, and an improvement in quality of sleep. The team's objective was to use low-cost, non-pharmacological methods to improve sleep and the patient experience, and reduce zolpidem use and patient falls. A core team of geriatricians, hospitalists, nurses, pharmacists, music therapists, and house staff were trained with project-specific educational materials. Posters about the project were displayed on the unit. On admission, patients received welcome bags with headphones, eye mask, earplugs, and literature on the project. Quiet hours (10 pm to 6 am) were instituted to minimize disruption. Patients were offered music therapy and interventions to improve nighttime comfort, such as warm blankets, warm milk, and tea. As an alternative to sedative-hypnotics, melatonin was introduced to the hospital formulary. A five-question sleep survey was administered to 125 patients pre- and post-intervention, and analyses of the unit's HCAHPS scores, zolpidem prescribing patterns, and fall rates were performed. These interventions led to significant improvement in the mean quality of sleep (2.8 vs. 3.34 post; scale 1-5, P=0.0003). HCAHPS scores had improving trends in four relevant categories, including quietness of the environment. Zolpidem orders trended down. There was no significant difference in fall rate; however, the unit baseline is low (2-4/month). There was no significant difference in the mean times woken (2. 16 vs 2. 12 post). Project Sleep demonstrated that, with staff engagement, and at low cost, easily available interventions could improve quality of sleep and patient experience while avoiding zolpidem use. Project Sleep was presented as a poster in the Innovations category at the Society of Hospital Medicine's Annual Meeting in March in San Diego, California, and at the national meeting of the American Geriatrics Society Presidential Poster Session in Long Beach, California, in May. It was awarded best in its category\u2014\"Quality of Life.\" In June it was presented at the resident research fair at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. MSBI - Project Sleep: A Multidisciplinary Quality Improvement Project MSH 8E Celebration An ice cream social was held on MSH 8E to recognize superior collaboration between Nursing and Building Services that resulted in improved patient experience scores. Clinical Nurse Manager Nicole Wells, BSN, RN, CMSRN said, \"Our ability to \u00a9 PressGaney Associates, Inc.Displayed by Discarge Date and T otal Sample The GP 8 East Patient Care T eam. provide excellent patient care is the result of the camaraderie and support we share with each other on a daily basis. We take pride in the relationships that develop across departments and positively influence patient outcomes.\"7 President's Recognition Award The President's Recognition Award was created in the fall of 2015 at Mount Sinai St. Luke's to recognize outstanding performance by employees.

Miniature Horse visits Kravis Children's Hospital Honor, a 10-month-old colt with Gentle Carousel Miniature Therapy Horses, recently trotted into the hearts of dozens of children and teens being treated at the Kravis Children's Hospital at Mount Sinai. A handful of patients were well enough to secure their doctors' permission to meet Honor in the playroom, while others watched remotely from their beds. Maria Benite with Honor the Therapy HorseMaria Benite broke into a smile when Honor pranced into the playroom. While Maria said her favorite animal is a horse, this one was quite different from what she expected. \"He's smaller,\" Maria whispered, staring at the chestnut horse. \"They are little horses, but they have big jobs,\" said Jorge Garcia-Bengochea, co-founder of Gentle Carousel. \"Miniature horses are herd animals, so they are very intuitive of what other horses are doing and needing. And they treat people the same way. They sense different emotions, different feelings that children have,\" Mr. Garcia-Bengochea said. \"Some children have been through very traumatic situations and they've shut down. Just being around the animal, they get animated, start talking and sometimes tell the horse things that they haven't told other people.\"8 Welcome Packet for Pediatric Patients at Kravis Children's Hospital Women's and Children's Services has a robust Professional Practice Committee (PPC) co-chaired by Clinical Nurse Shenin Carpenter, BSN, RN, and Clinical Nurse Managers Carrie Gerber, MSN, RN, and Emily Kropp, BSN, RN, CPN. The division consists of several pediatric units, mother/baby units, Labor and Delivery, and the NICU. The co-chairs invited Chief Patient Experience Officer Sandra Myerson to be a guest speaker at their January meeting. Ms. Myerson reminded them that the majority of patients admitted to pediatrics were first-time visitors to a hospital. Additionally, she spoke about the anxiety of the first visit to a hospital, especially since the majority of these patients come through the Emergency Department as an unplanned/unscheduled admission. A discussion ensued regarding welcome packets that have unit, hospital, and amenity information for patients and parents. The Committee agreed that pediatric packets were not as welcoming as the ones given out in the mother/baby units, and they decided to make improvements. They held a brainstorming meeting to discuss the new packet, and nurse managers and PPC members brought it to unit staff meetings to get additional input and feedback. The co-chairs also met with the Family Advisory Council to get their thoughts about what would be helpful to families of hospitalized children. The PPC established a subcommittee of pediatric clinical nurses, a nurse manager, and a Business Associate to design the new packet. They spent many hours putting it together and it is in the final stages. Emily Kropp noted that this multidisciplinary group was engaged, creative and enthusiastic, and appreciated the input of the Family Advisory Council. They look forward to completing the packet in early fall. Left to Right: Emily Kropp, BSN, BSN, RNMarch 2016 Daisy Honoree\u2014 Carlene Warner, MSBI, 8 Silver Nurses come to the profession in many ways, some traditional\u2014like those who follow in the footsteps of family members who inspired them to pursue nursing. Others become nurses for different and sometimes surprising reasons. Carlene Warner, BSN, RN, the Daisy honoree of the month from Mount Sinai Beth Israel, 8 Silver, first decided to become a nurse because of decubitus pressure ulcers. \"I was a Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) providing home care for a patient with multiple pressure ulcers, and I was interested in her healing process,\" she said. \"I was changing her dressings, and seeing my patient's wounds healed made an impact on me.\" Ms. Warner, who is on the hospital's Skin Saver T eam, now leads MSBI nurses in their care of complicated skin conditions and patients requiring extra attention to prevent skin breakdown. Her initial fascination with healing and caring for other people led her to become a registered nurse, and she plans to pursue her nursing certification this year, with the eventual goal of becoming a clinical nurse specialist or nurse practitioner specializing in wound care. Ms. Warner has always gone above and beyond to promote her patients' healing. When she was a Patient Care Associate (PCA) in oncology, she would cook meals for patients to help stimulate their appetite. She took classes in leadership training that helped her to see the implications of being a nurse, and \"opened my eyes to what I was embarking on.\" Ms. Warner says she is never alone in nursing. \"Nursing is a team, and I feel like I am a member of a team,\" she said. This feeling has only grown throughout her career. While working during the height of the AIDS epidemic in the 1990s, Ms. Warner said that she loved being a part of a care and healing team, even when the details about the virus were uncertain. When asked to reflect on how she feels about being a nurse, her decision to pursue a career in nursing, and being a Daisy honoree, Ms. Warner said, \"I have no regrets about my career path. I cannot envision myself doing anything else.\" 9Mount Sinai Y outh Advisory Council (Y AC) The Mount Sinai Y outh Advisory Council (Y AC) was established in October 2015 to enhance the delivery of pediatric care at Mount Sinai's Kravis Children's Hospital by recognizing and addressing the specific needs of our youth population. At the inaugural meeting, seven youth ranging in ages from 13 to 18 met in the Child Life Zone to begin this important work. The Council is facilitated by Certified Child Life Specialist Morgan Stojanowski and Pediatric Social Worker Lauren Powledge. Y AC members gather monthly to collaborate on a broad range of patient care projects, working with a variety of clinicians and staff to bring actionable recommendations to improve the patient experience. One Y AC project was a collaboration with musician Luke Wade (from NBC's The Voice) and Cook's Children's Hospital in Fort Worth, T exas, to write and record \"Do What Y ou Love, Love What Y ou Do.\" This song highlights Child Life Zone program-ming at Mount Sinai and in pediatric hospitals across the coun-try. The Y AC was involved with every aspect of this creative project, from the development of lyrics to the making of the mu-sic video.

Our physicians strive to assure that\u2014with every patient in every clinical encounter\u2014patients not only are heard and cared for, but also feel heard and cared for. Across the Mount Sinai Health System, physicians now have the opportunity to receive peer-led communication coaching and consultation from Physician Communication Ambassadors, colleagues who have been appointed by their leadership to serve in the role. Besides practicing clinical communication in their own daily practice, Physician Communication Ambassadors have completed extensive training in health communication strategies as well as coaching and consultative skills. A physician who used the service commented: \" At first, I was skeptical of the value of receiving coaching. But the suggestions were very practical and produced immediate results.\" Another physician said, \"With a couple of tweaks, I now feel much more connected with my patients.\" T o request this service or for more information, please contact Y osuke Chikamoto, PhD, Director, Center of Excellence in Physician Communication, at yosuke.chikamoto@mountsinai.org or 212-241-9507. Ms. Salman, a terminally ill patient at Mount Sinai Brooklyn (MSB), desperately wanted to see her son married before she passed away. After hearing her request, the cardiac team immediately put plans in place to make this wish come true\u2014the same day. Led by Barry Huppert, MD, Chief of Cardiology at MSB; Rabbi Jacob Hoenig, an MSB chaplain; and the 3E nursing team, they quickly transformed the 3 East lounge into a wedding chapel. By 3 pm, the lounge and corridor were filled with the patient's family, bride and groom, and hospital staff from all departments. The patient was able to view the ceremony from her bed, and was thrilled that her wish became a reality. The staff and support service team brought the details together within hours, and the patient and her family could not have been more thankful.

An idea is spreading across the Mount Sinai Health System. On a recent day at Mount Sinai West, a patient's relative was seen coming into the unit hallway holding a Thank Y ou card signed by staff members and delivered at the bedside to the patient. The relative expressed delight at this personal, compassionate touch. Showing appreciation and gratitude for staff and patients is a powerful catalyst for better experiences. In 2015, Mount Sinai Queens launched a Thank Y ou card for patients. Mount Sinai West recently adopted this practice on its postpartum units as well as in the Ambulatory Surgery setting. With strong cross-site collaboration, the team at Mount Sinai West was able to quickly adapt the design and processes first launched at Mount Sinai Queens. These notes, given at the time of discharge or sent to a patient's home, express authentic thanks for allowing us the privilege of providing care. The unit-based clinical teams sign the cards to make the Thank Y ou truly personal. A simple Thank Y ou really does go a long way! To Whom It May Concern: I recently had a stay in the Cardiac Care Unit at Mount Sinai St. Lukes (April 7 - 11, 2016). While of course the experience was no fun, the help that I received from the nurses in the unit was wonderful. Not only did they appear to be extremely competent at patient care, but they were also kind, friendly, and personable. I would mention in particular Jemina, Anuj, Keiko, and Kavitha. I hope that my gratitude to these kind and very competent people can be passed on to them. Sincerely, Mary Lou McGanney, PhDTHANK YOU On behalf of everyone at Mount Sinai West, we wish you well. We hope we provided compassionate, professional care, and helped you feel well taken care of.
