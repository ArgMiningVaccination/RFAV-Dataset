David Gulpilil from documentary My Name is Gulpilil . Image: Miles Rowland.9 September 2021 The Hon Paul Fletcher MP Minister for Communications, Urban Infrastructure, Cities and the Arts Parliament House Canberra ACT 2600Dear Minister The Board of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation is pleased to present its Annual Report for the year ended 30 June 2021. The report was prepared for section 46 of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 , in accordance with the requirements of that Act and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 . It was approved by the Board on 9 September 2021 and provides a streamlined, yet full, overview of the ABC's performance and delivery in line with its Charter remit. A year on we are still grappling with the impact of COVID-19 on the way our employees work and deliver the services that Australians expect of us. Our content teams, with our support teams, have continued to put in a huge effort to ensure all Australians have been kept reliably informed. Their hard work and commitment have resulted in ABC News becoming the leading digital news brand reaching half the population per month. The ABC News app continues to break audience records while the ABC NEWS channel has maintained the reach growth achieved in 2020. The ABC is performing well across all platforms with our employees continuing to find new ways to stay connected with each other and our audiences. Their commitment through these difficult times has allowed us to remain creative, engaging and informative, as illustrated in this report. Ita Buttrose AC, OBE Chair Letter to the Minister iLetter to the MinisterAnh Do in Anh's Brush with Fame. ii AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2021Contents 1Contents Letter to the Minister i Foreword from the Chair 2 The Board 4 Purpose and vision 10 The leadership team 11 Where we are 12 What we do 14 Snapshot of the ABC 2021 15The year ahead 16 Content, services and communities 18Audience data and analysis 54 Inside the ABC 70 Responsibility 90Accountability 104Annual Performance Statements 117Financial Statements 130 Appendices 184Compliance Index 238 Glossary 240Next year the ABC will celebrate its 90th anniversary. As that significant milestone draws nearer it's timely to reflect on how much we have helped shape Australia since 1932. From small beginnings - our first wireless radio broadcast reached six per cent of the population - the ABC today reaches 90 per cent of all Australians every year. Over the years we have continuously increased our commitment and investment in regional communities whenever we've had the opportunity to do so. Today we operate from 48 locations and our local radio network reaches around three million Australians every week. We work hard at maintaining a deep connection with regional and rural communities, telling personal stories and celebrating life on the land. The resilient and inspirational Australians living outside our major cities help us laugh with their unique good humour. The ABC's commitment to serving regional Australia and connecting all parts of the nation is unmatched by any other media organisation. In recent months, many local media and news providers have either withdrawn from regional Australia or closed down altogether, so much so that some places are at risk of becoming 'news deserts'. There has been growing pressure on the ABC to fill the gap. The ABC recently signed letters of intent with both Google and Facebook for payments under the news media bargaining code that will enable the ABC to make new and significant investment to support public interest journalism in regional Australia. We are excited at the prospect of being able to do this and anticipate these agreements will be in place by the end of this year. There's no doubt that the Australian media and entertainment landscape is going through a period of revolutionary change. Global streaming platforms, like Netflix and Amazon, are reshaping viewing habits across many Australian households. Last year, the Australian Government, seeking to lower the cost burden on Australia's commercial free-to-air broadcasters, suspended quotas for Australian content. The aim was to bolster the free-to-air players' competitiveness against the international giants. Australians should be aware of these developments and what they mean for Australian stories and creativity. Thank heavens for the ABC because telling Australian stories is central to our purpose. For nearly 90 years we have created, commissioned and collaborated with independent production houses to make Australian drama, comedy, children's content and factual programs that inform, entertain, move and provoke. We ensure that Australians wherever they live are informed about what matters to them in their local area, their region and across the nation. Our local radio network always has been a lifeline for small and remote communities and is now even more important with the disappearance of local newsrooms. With an enormous, undifferentiated global onslaught of unreliable sources, fake news, partisan commentary and biased coverage, the ABC remains the most valued source of reliable information for Australians. It's the place Australians can rely upon when they want the facts. Over the past 12 months the ABC has performed well across all platforms as Australians turned to us for essential information and analysis, entertainment, and specialist content. At a time when Australians need trustworthy information more than ever, ABC News is the leading digital news brand, reaching half the population each month. Fifty-one per cent of all Australians aged 2+ (12.8 million people) engaged with ABC News via the website or app in June 2021.Foreword from the Chair 2 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2021Through the course of the coronavirus pandemic, our ABC Education experts have been working side-by-side with state education departments and schoolteachers to create content suitable for children learning at home. Our Behind the News program offers a fun and accessible way to help young people understand and interpret what's going on in our world. In short, we've never provided better value for the investment Australians have entrusted to us. We live in an interconnected world. Australia is affected by powerful global forces, whether they are at the microscopic scale of the coronavirus pandemic or in the catastrophic weather events now propelled by climate change. Our world is becoming more, not less, complex. The ABC's commitment to Australian storytelling and public discussion is more vital now than it has ever been. We provide a safe space for Australians to consider and debate the issues that confront them, the perspectives they may not have considered, and what being Australian might mean. This helps Australians come together as a nation and strengthens us for the challenges and the opportunities ahead. The ABC is part of the national infrastructure that keeps Australia safe, aware, informed, stable, and united through times of change. As we approach our 90th anniversary we can be proud of our decades of service to Australia through peace and war, through booms and busts, through natural disasters and national triumphs. We have done well, and this report provides further detail on our continuing value to the Australian people. Ita Buttrose AC, OBE Chair, Australian Broadcasting Corporation Image: Peter Matthew.

Snapshot of the ABC 2021 15The year ahead The coming year, 2021-22, will be the ABC's 90th as Australia's national public broadcaster. Celebrations for the anniversary of its founding and first broadcasts, which will fall on 1 July 2022, will begin from January. The ABC will reflect on where it has come from over nine decades, its current vital role in depicting Australian life and culture today, and how it must evolve in a shifting media environment to continue to play that role in the decades to come. Central to that process of evolution is the ABC Five-Year Plan 2020-25 , which sets out a strategy for accelerating the Corporation's transformation from a traditional broadcaster into a trusted, valued and accessible digital content provider for all Australians. In 2021-22, the second substantive year of that plan, the ABC will continue to focus tightly on its implementation. Providing audiences with a more personalised and relevant ABC experience is an important priority of the Five-Year Plan . The ABC will introduce a requirement that audiences sign in to an ABC account to access ABC iview, which will enable personalisation improvements, including program recommendations, personal watchlists and the ability to resume viewing across different devices. These changes will bring the features of ABC iview in line with public expectations of services in the contemporary Australian video-on-demand market. The Corporation has developed privacy controls to protect audiences' personal information and will continually refine them to ensure that they represent industry best practice. The ABC's three content divisions and its international services will collaborate on a major project to develop a long-term strategy for all ABC audio services, including live audio and radio, on-demand content and podcasts.To support its ambition of being more relevant to more Australians, the Corporation has committed to decentralising its workforce and ensuring that more than 75% of its content-makers are located outside of its Ultimo office. During the year, the ABC will work towards relocating around 300 staff from Ultimo to Sydney's population centre in Parramatta, as announced in June 2021. The work will include a process to find and develop an appropriate new facility and to identify the roles that will be relocated. The ABC intends to complete the move of teams to the new Parramatta site by 2024. It will also continue to examine possible property, operations and production changes in other state capitals and in regional Australia that may enable it to locate more content-makers closer to the communities they serve. To achieve its ambition of looking and sounding like contemporary Australia, the Corporation is emphasising diversity and inclusion across the stories that it tells and in the composition of its workforce. During the year, it will look to refresh the Diversity and Inclusion Plan 2019-22 and the Elevate Reconciliation Action Plan 2019-22 , which focus its commitments in this area. The year 2021-22 brings to an end the ABC's current funding triennium. The Corporation will provide a funding submission for the next three years to government in late 2021. In particular, the ABC will seek the continuation of funding for the Enhanced Newsgathering program, which enables it to deliver more tailored and local news, and bring news from across the country to a national audience. It is due to lapse at the end of the triennium. The Corporation will also make the case for its enduring value to the Australian people and seek the reinstatement of funding indexation, consistent with the approach in the forward estimates set out in the May 2021 Commonwealth Budget. 16 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2021The government's Media Reform Green Paper, released in November 2020, created an opportunity for a much-needed discussion about future pathways for the television industry in Australia. Having responded to the Green Paper in May 2021, the ABC will continue to engage with government and other broadcasters to seek policy settings that will support the sustainability of the Australian television and screen industry, and strengthen the public-policy outcomes it delivers. In particular, the Corporation will argue for regulatory mechanisms to ensure the prominence of broadcaster video-on-demand services like ABC iview on connected-TV platforms. After the News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code became law in February 2021, the ABC entered into negotiations with Google and Facebook over payment for the use of its news content on those platforms and signed letters of agreement with the companies in May. The Corporation expects to finalise agreements in the second half of 2021. It will deploy the funds to support new public-interest journalism initiatives for regional Australia. Throughout 2021-22, the Corporation will continue to seek new opportunities and initiatives to ensure that it delivers valued and valuable services to the people of Australia. It will review its performance and continue to refine the Five-Year Plan as required.

News that matters to Australians ABC NEWS was Australia's No 1 digital news brand in 2020, topping the rankings every month across the year. Average daily audiences were up 77% to 2.21 million, compared with 2019. 6 Audiences also continued to spend more time with the ABC than any other news brand. With the country enduring COVID-19 lockdowns, changing restrictions and shifting vaccination advice, Australians trusted and valued the ABC to provide detailed and localised information across different states and territories. In the biggest crowd-sourcing project in the ABC's history, readers were invited to submit questions about COVID-19 to help shape news stories to match their needs. Audiences asked more than 200,000 questions, and the ABC's Audience Engagement team read every one. The initiative put readers, listeners and viewers at the centre of editorial meetings and led to the development of new explainers on key topics, such as the vaccination rollout, COVID-19 symptoms and travel restrictions. Broadcast flagships such as AM, the 7pm News and 7.30 helped audiences make sense of the response to the crisis and scrutinised and interrogated the decisions of our leaders. Local radio programs provided relevant local news and information as the situation evolved in different ways across the country. The daily Coronacast podcast, a collaboration between ABC NEWS and the ABC Science team, continued to attract large audiences, with 16 million downloads in the year to date. That figure translated to an average download rate of 114,000 per episode. 7 The podcast ranked in the top on-demand programs on the ABC listen app throughout the year and often rose to the No 1 spot when outbreaks occurred. Radio National's (RN) timely miniseries Patient Zero rode a wave of interest in contact tracing and infectious disease control to the top of the Australian podcast charts. 6 Source: Nielsen Digital Content Ratings, Australia, 2+. 7 Source: ABC Podsights data.

The first ABC Indigenous podcast, Thin Black Line , marked the 30th anniversary of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. This six-part series presented by Walkley Award-winning investigative journalist Allan Clarke examined the infamous 1993 death in custody of Aboriginal teenager Daniel Yock. Forging a connection The ABC NEWS COVID live blog came into its own this year. The ABC NEWS Digital team blogged throughout the pandemic, providing guidance and information for hundreds of thousands of people. The team shared the latest news, information, links and even a joke with audience members during stressful times. For many, the blogs became a virtual community during a time of enforced social isolation, a place where they could come together to follow the daily press conferences and global events. This connection also gave audiences a direct link to ABC reporting teams, enabling them to ask questions and receive replies in real time and see how others grappled with the same concerns. The experience showed that engaged readers wanted to be part of the news-making process. As a result, news teams opened up the lines of communication on many issues beyond COVID-19, such as the Federal Budget, state elections and issues like racism and sexual harassment. ABC local radio stations provided another strong point of connection for audiences during the pandemic, helping people make sense of the unfolding situation and allowing them to ask questions in real time via talkback and social media. During Melbourne's 112-day lockdown, ABC Melbourne provided in-depth news and comprehensive coverage, and also engaged Melburnians with humour and empathy.In February, Facebook blocked all news in response to proposed Australian Government legislation to make tech companies pay for content that surfaces on their platforms. This was a pivotal moment in the Australian media landscape, and it provided the ABC with a chance to position itself as the best source of trustworthy news and information. This included a campaign to promote ABC NEWS across digital, outdoor and ABC TV channels, showcasing the ABC NEWS app and digital. Bringing the world back home The ABC's foreign correspondents in Washington, London and Tokyo stayed on location through the worst of the pandemic, working under extraordinary conditions. They endured extended periods of lockdown and isolation at home so they could continue to travel - when safe - to report on the unfolding crisis. Foreign correspondents brought Australian audiences frontline reports on the global crisis: as China imposed strict lockdowns and fought back against mounting international criticism of its handling of the outbreak; from inside a hospital in the US so overwhelmed that it converted a car park into a COVID-19 ward; from the Indian state of Maharashtra, the hardest hit by the Delta variant; from Fukushima and Tokyo, tracing the hopes and dread of the people of Japan as momentum built toward the Olympic Games. Reporters in India, Papua New Guinea and Thailand came home temporarily. Jakarta Correspondent Anne Barker was brought home in 2020 and continues to cover Indonesia and the region from Australia. The ABC also set up a temporary bureau in Seoul with reporter Carrington Clarke and camera operator Mitchell Woolnough to cover China. They will remain in Seoul until January. Content, services and communities 21Bill Birtles' departure from China In September 2020, the ABC's China correspondent Bill Birtles was forced to seek refuge in the Australian Embassy in Beijing while diplomats negotiated his departure from China in an unprecedented standoff with China's government. His departure meant that there were no Australian foreign correspondents on the ground for the first time in decades. Bill's evacuation from Beijing came amid a massive deterioration in relations between Beijing and Canberra. In the days before he sought refuge in the embassy, he was harassed and questioned by police and there were real fears that he could be detained. However, to date neither the Chinese Government nor the Australian Government have been able to explain why Australian reporters including Bill were targeted.In the months before his departure, Bill had continually questioned Chinese authorities on their actions in relation to Australia, had pursued stories about China's response to the pandemic, China's human rights record and had broken stories about China imprisoning Australian citizens. He did all this work despite ongoing pressure from Chinese officials. On his return to Australia, Bill has continued to report on China and to provide our audience with an Australian perspective on a country and story that is shaping global events. Throughout the ordeal in China, Bill stayed calm and composed. He was clear eyed about the situation and navigated interviews with security officials, police and diplomatic staff in China in a way that ensured both his own safety and the safety of our team in Beijing was maintained. The ABC subsequently established a new, short-term posting in the South Korean capital of Seoul to expand reporting in North Asia.The Middle East reporter stayed until January this year.

In October 2020, ABC Radio Australia became the home of the NRL in the Pacific, with a three-year deal to broadcast live coverage of the NRL and rugby union men's and women's competitions. With funding from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), the ABC created Can You Be More Pacific , a new Pacific-focused sports program for ABC Radio Australia. It builds on existing content for Pacific radio audiences that includes Pacific news and current affairs (delivered in English and through the in-language Wantok program) produced by the specialist Pacific team in the Asia Pacific Newsroom. The ABC also launched a Pan Pacific TV sports show, That Pacific Sports Show , examining the experiences of Pacific sports women and men in Australia and across the region. It is filmed in Sydney with presenters of Pacific heritage, and uses local crews in-country to produce and film stories. The ABC also commissioned the ground-breaking Pacific women's program Sistas, Let's Talk , and broadcasts education content for preschool and early primary students in Pacific Playtime . ABC International had another successful year distributing the ABC's New Year's Eve coverage to audiences in the Indo-Pacific.

While COVID-19 prevented the internships from being run in 2020, videos about the initiative were produced and shared widely across the Indo-Pacific region. Content, services and communities 25Emergency broadcasting When emergencies strike, audiences look to the ABC for up-to-the-minute information and advice. In September 2020, the ABC launched a new Emergency website https://www.abc.net.au/ emergency/ . The website uses an interactive incident map that displays information on active events across the country, covering everything from COVID-19 restrictions to earthquakes and tsunamis. It gives users links to local emergency agencies, and provides information on relevant local radio and social networks as well as advice to help Australians prepare for emergencies. It is also mobile friendly with improved accessibility features. In the future, it will be available via voice assistants such as Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, giving people hands-free access to emergency updates for every suburb and town across the country. A summer campaign to raise awareness about the new website and the local ABC AM/FM frequencies for emergency information ran on ABC platforms and included social media videos on preparing for emergency events. The campaign drove an increase in awareness of the ABC's emergency platforms among our target audience (18-54 year olds) from 40% to 49%. 10Emergencies during 2020-21 Throughout the year, the ABC's emergency broadcasting team and local teams provided critical information for 212 events. This was far fewer than the 953 events of the previous year that included the Black Summer bushfires. Eleven of the emergency events in 2020-21 lasted more than seven days each, including the Wooroloo fire in the Perth Hills that destroyed 86 homes. The fire coincided with a COVID-19 lockdown in Perth, which created additional health considerations for emergency authorities and ABC crews. Australia experienced major flooding events during the year, including the category 3 cyclone Seroja in April, which caused flooding and widespread damage in the Kalbarri and Geraldton regions in WA. A major flood on the Mid-North Coast of NSW kept the emergency team busy in March and April. The team worked closely with the ABC's Port Macquarie bureau to bring emergency information to residents caught in flood waters. Thousands of people were evacuated from their homes as the floods moved into northern NSW. As floods and storms hit Gippsland and Melbourne in early June 2021, the ABC provided emergency broadcast coverage in Sale and Traralgon and supported residents in the Dandenong Ranges, who were without power for up to a month. 10 Source: ABC Corporate Tracker.

Other initiatives included expanding the digitisation of the ABC Archive and establishing an Indigenous Archive Unit to better manage the ABC's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander collection.

No media organisation does more than the ABC to promote and provide a forum for the arts and artists in Australia. More than three-quarters of Australians say the ABC encourages and promotes Australian performing arts, such as music and drama, in line with the ABC Charter. In May 2021, the ABC built on its unrivalled commitment to the arts with the ABC TV Plus launch of primetime show Art Works , Australia's only dedicated weekly arts television program. The weekly half-hour show, hosted by Namila Benson, is dedicated to exploring the full spectrum of the arts in Australia, from major arts companies to the avant-garde. Also on ABC TV in 2020-21 were new arts documentaries and series, such as Finding the Archibald and Firestarter: The Story of Bangarra , alongside live music shows The Sound and The Set . Programs on RN covered the full spectrum of the arts, including The Stage Show , The Art Show , The Book Show , The Music Show , The Screen Show , The Bookshelf , Lost and Found , Blueprint , Stop Everything! and Indigenous program Awaye! . Coverage on the ABC's national music networks - triple j, triple j Unearthed, Double J, ABC Classic, ABC Jazz and ABC Country - featured many major cultural events and initiatives, such as triple j's One Night Stand and ABC Classic's Festival of Female Composers.For online audiences, ABC Arts was the destination to discover articles, reviews, blogs and videos on the best contemporary artists, musicians, filmmakers and festivals. The ABC further boosted its coverage of the arts in response to the ongoing impact of COVID-19. This included urgent and critical support for Australian independent producers and creatives through the Arts Digital Fund, the Australian Music Fund and the ABC Classic and ABC Jazz Composer Commissioning Fund. With the lights out in theatres and concert halls due to the pandemic, the ABC also launched its biggest-ever on-demand catalogue on ABC iview of performances from Australian arts companies, across theatre, opera, ballet and classical music. The ABC's support for Australian arts and culture was exemplified by the launch of the ABC Classic virtual choir in late 2020. More than 1,500 people of all ages joined voices to premiere a new Christmas carol by Yorta Yorta composer Deborah Cheetham, coming together to lift their spirits and connect with loved ones in a time of need. ABC Jazz 100.Missy Higgins performing on The Set . Image: Jess Gleeson. Content, services and communities 43In 2020-21, the ABC continued to improve the experiences of audiences using mobile devices and on-demand platforms. This included matching people with content that suits their tastes and preferences and enhancing the appearance, discoverability and useability of the ABC's digital products. Growing digital audiences ABC iview became the No 1 broadcast video-on- demand service in Australia, with a 27% share in June 2021. 38 This was driven in part by record levels of content, which increased to more than 4,200 hours of drama, comedy, documentaries and movies, as well as Indigenous, arts, family and young adult content. During the pandemic, the ABC expanded its digital rights acquisitions to bring on-demand arts and music programs across ballet, opera, orchestral performances and theatre, and the music program The Sound , to audiences at a time when many live events were limited. Content rights have continued to support the growth of ABC iview, resulting in an expanded program inventory. This focus moved ABC iview away from being a catch-up model to offering longer availability of content and full catalogues of programs. Across the year, programs such as Outback Ringer , Love On The Spectrum (Season 2) and Quoll Farm drove younger and less-frequent audiences to ABC iview. For audio content, triple j drew large audiences to its app with REQUESTIVAL, one week in May where all music is chosen by the audience. The triple j app averaged 219,000 daily streams between Monday and Friday, peaking on Friday with 248,000, with 99% being live streams. This is +84% higher than the daily average for 2021 year to date, or +137% higher than an average day (excluding Hottest 100 Countdown days). There were 80,000 requests during the week, with 1.1 million triple j streams. Digital news The ABC constantly improves its digital news services to bring Australians the trusted news and information they want, in the way they want to consume it. A new dedicated video desk was established to create, curate and distribute dynamic video content for the ABC and third-party platforms. The ABC NEWS channel output is now a segmented stream, which means videos can be clipped into segments and published on YouTube, ABC NEWS Digital and ABC iview. Segmented content supports on-demand and algorithmic delivery of news, and users can now access regional TV packages alongside the weekly ABC NEWS Regional episode, with this regional on-demand video content also supporting greater visibility of regional issues in digital articles. ABC NEWS presenter Jeremy Fernandez.Evolving the digital experience 38 Source: OzTAM VPM Total (VOD+LIVE) minute data, June 2021 . 44 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2021ABC NEWS launched the Video Lab collection on ABC iview to showcase short, digital-first explainer stories on topics like the Delta and Delta Plus variants of COVID-19 and the efficacy of vaccines. This approach complements in-depth digital programs on big stories, such as Stan Grant's special that unpacked the Israel-Gaza conflict, and shows like China Tonight , which is segmented to allow audiences to consume it in different ways. The ABC listen app saw strong use, with users able to hear the top stories on demand any hour of the day and get news briefings from finance, sport and world news. All state and territory capital-city news teams now publish Flash Briefings on ABC listen. Listeners can now access more local news on demand, with 80 local news bulletins now available on ABC listen each weekday.

Image: Hugh Stewart.Personalising your experience In March 2021, the ABC introduced a login prompt for ABC iview that asks users to create an ABC account by entering some basic information. Creating an account allows users to personalise their ABC iview experience and receive features such as content recommendations and the ability to resume watching specific programs across different devices. Research in 2020 by the ABC showed that about 95% of ABC iview users were interested in personalised features, such as watchlists and notifications for new episodes of favourite programs. The changes introduced in 2021 also included managing users' consent to the ABC's Privacy Policy and Privacy Collection Statement - logged-in users can choose to agree or 'reconsent' to the changes, log out of their account or request that their account be deleted. Mandatory login for ABC iview will be rolled out next year. The latest version of the ABC listen app released to Apple and Android devices included News Stream - a continuous audio stream of news and current affairs content from across the ABC, updated and on demand. Users can skip News Stream content, and stories that have already been played do not repeat, which means news remains fresh and relevant. These advances delivered on the ABC's strategy to improve audience experiences on digital platforms and mobile devices. ABC iview app updates The ABC rolled out major updates to the new ABC iview app on smart TVs. The app was rebuilt and redesigned for modern TVs and large-screen devices, providing a cleaner and more accessible interface. ABC iview account holders receive rich personalisation features and program previews to help viewers find the latest releases of ABC content and discover new and original programming. The launch of ABC iview sub-profiles in May 2021 means users can tailor their personal experience and create profiles so their children can access trusted content from ABC Kids and ABC ME. The updated app also has adaptive video streaming, which makes higher-quality streams more reliable over slower network connections. 2020 Good Design Awards for ABC apps In September 2020, the ABC won coveted awards at the Good Design Awards, one of the oldest and most prestigious competitions for design excellence in Australia. The ABC Kids app won a Good Design Award in the Digital Apps and Software category, and the triple j app won a Good Design Award in the Best-in-Class category, which represents the highest level of design excellence. The awards reflected the ABC's commitment to providing innovative, forward-thinking design and accessibility solutions to meet audience needs and expectations. Online education The ABC's Early Education website provided more than 400 engaging, curriculum-aligned resources, including curated programs from ABC Kids and ABC Kids listen, along with web notes for screen-free follow-up in early education and care settings around the country. ABC Education also released premium content to teachers via a new portal just for teachers that provides flexible access to free resources. Called the Teacher Profile initiative, it allows teachers to stream and download video content for later use, including clips and full episodes of educational ABC programs, together with teacher notes and other content. As well as providing for more flexible use of educational material under the Copyright Act, it will help the ABC better understand teachers' needs and deliver a more personalised service in the future. More than 11,000 teachers have created a profile. 46 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2021Social media The ABC continued to use social media channels to promote its offerings and create original and innovative content.

It gave curious kids the chance to ask questions about issues like disability, gender, politics, NAIDOC Week and the environment.

It had nearly 1 million views across Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. Content, services and communities 47The heart of the ABC's purpose and vision is to reflect the diverse nation it serves, to tell stories of what it means to be Australian and to ensure its workforce is inclusive. During the year, the ABC sought to embody these values in all its work. Diverse Australians The ABC aims to tell the stories of all Australians - stories that people across the country will recognise and understand. Throughout the year, the ABC highlighted diverse stories and perspectives from around the nation. Season 2 of the multi award-winning Love On The Spectrum continued to follow young neurodiverse people in their quest to find true love, teaching us all new lessons about love, intimacy and acceptance. The Compass episode 'Whatever Happened To ...?' showed how different religious and faith groups deal with COVID-19. 'The Upside', a one-hour Compass program on the ethics of prenatal screening, was presented by Julia Hales, the first ABC TV presenter living with Down syndrome. To mark Lunar New Year 2021, the ABC International team curated a selection of programs with simplified Chinese subtitles on ABC iview. The highlight of the offering was season 1 of Bluey , dubbed in Mandarin. The Lunar New Year poetry video series Poems for the Moon , which showcases Asian Australian poets' works on tradition, legacy, identity and sense of place, was repackaged for 2021 and shared on ABC iview, ABC Australia and via RN Facebook and Instagram and ABC Australia Facebook accounts. The ABC Classic and ABC Jazz Composer Commissioning Fund, launched in April 2021, supported new music works from emerging and diverse voices. The $90,000 fund prioritised opportunities for women, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, people with disability, gender-diverse people and other diverse musicians.Indigenous voices The ABC's flagship national radio programs Speaking Out and Awaye! continued to deliver standout coverage of Indigenous issues. Speaking Out examined the rights of Indigenous women in the workplace, featuring commentary from advocates across the health, education and community sectors. Awaye! covered major contributions from First Nations' artists across diverse practices, such as the visual arts, performance, traditional and contemporary dance, music, literature and poetry. In 2020, Awaye! was named one of the top 10 'Binge-Worthy Podcasts In The Age of Coronavirus' by The New York Times . Awaye! also expanded its Word Up broadcast series to consolidate its connections with remote, regional and rural language-revival communities across Australia, including Djapugay (Far North Queensland), Western Arrernte (Ntaria, Northern Territory), Nukunu Ranges, South Australia), Australia) and Gamilaraay (North Western NSW).

ABC television and ABC iview screened Re-Frame , a showcase of films made by people with disability hosted by Bridie McKim from The Heights . Disability stories and voices also featured on News Breakfast , The Drum , Landline , Gardening Australia and Behind the News . National radio programs and stations explored everything from disability in the arts to the definition of disability itself. ABC capital city stations and regional bureaux worked with co-hosts and behind-the-scenes producers with disability to bring audiences the local stories of disability. Commissioning for diversity The ABC launched Commissioning for Diversity and Inclusion Guidelines for screen content in February 2021, to ensure more diverse faces, voices, cultures and stories are reflected and represented on Australian screens.Based on the principle of 'nothing about us without us', the guidelines embed diversity and inclusion in all content decision-making processes for ABC screen productions. The guidelines require production companies to provide greater access and opportunity to under-represented people and perspectives - on and off screen - including gender diversity, Indigenous Australians, culturally and linguistically diverse communities, people living with disability and the LGBTQI+ community. Similar processes are evolving for acquired screen content and audio programming. Women in technology The ABC works hard to ensure diversity and gender balance in its workplaces and to develop women's careers - including advancing more women into careers in technology. In 2020-21, the proportion of women technologists at the ABC increased to 20%, exceeding the 2021 target of 18.75% and already meeting the 2022 target of 20%.Corey 'Nooki' Webster, host of triple j's First Nations music program Blak Out.

This includes 7pm News bulletins for the first time. The initiative is part of the ABC's Elevate Reconciliation Action Plan , which has as one of its aims a goal to make Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages part of Australia's every day conversation. Phillipa McDermott, ABC Indigenous Lead, said, \"Indigenous languages and place names are not just a means of simple identification. They express knowledge about everything we know: family, clan, law, geography, history, relationships, religion, anatomy, country, everything.\" First Nations Talent Portal This year, the ABC launched the First Nations Talent Portal to promote current and emerging First Nations voices, spokespeople and screen practitioners. The portal allows ABC content makers to easily find the right person for guest appearances, producing, reporting, researching, backfill, acting and hosting roles. 50 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 202150:50 Equality In March 2021, the 50:50 Equality project met its milestone of equal representation between female and male interviewees and contributors to all ABC NEWS content, with a result of 51% women's voices. Of the 48 news teams participating in the challenge, 75% reached 50:50 in March - from a baseline of just 29% when tracking began. A further 15% of participating teams increased their representation of women in March. These efforts were widely praised, with National President of the Economic Society of Australia, Danielle Wood, calling the initiative a \"game changer\", and the CEO of Science in Australia Gender Equity, Dr Wafa El-Adhami, saying: \"The ABC is signalling that gender equality and diversity matter to them, that it should matter to Australia.\" The project is being expanded to boost representation of Indigenous Australians, people from diverse communities and people with disability. This process includes support for editorial training and production, which is changing the way ABC NEWS develops and selects stories, so that more news content is a true reflection of contemporary Australia.

Talent Fund Through the Content Ideas Lab Talent Fund pilot, five young and diverse digital creators joined the ABC and worked with content teams to develop and produce original talent-led formats. Their work performed well with audiences and demonstrated how the ABC can reach new and younger audiences with the right combination of talent, content and platforms. The new hires included TikTok influencer Leonardo Sunshine, who was brought on by triple j to develop, produce and present new formats for the triple j TikTok account. The account grew by more than 39% as a result. The pilot also created new pathways to entry via a content pitching process, accessible public callouts and online talent scouting.

The research-based initiative is designed to bring Australians together and launch a conversation about the issues that are important to the nation. The survey enables the ABC to dig into the attitudes, behaviours and experiences of people from all walks of life. The resulting data brims with fascinating insights into how Australians live, what they believe and what keeps them awake at night. Working in conjunction with Vox Pop Labs and an academic panel, the Australia Talks National Survey was first fielded in 2019 and again in 2021. It involved upwards of 54,000 respondents in 2019 and 60,000 in 2021. More than 600 questions were included in the 2021 Australia Talks National Survey, covering a broad range of topics and issues. An ABC TV promotional campaign reached approximately 5.8 million total people. 43 The data and insights from those surveys were used to develop the Australia Talks online tool (https://abc.net.au/australiatalks ), a short, personalised interactive that allows users to get up close and personal with the data and see how their views and habits compare with the Australian community. At its heart, Australia Talks is about hearing and seeing the stories of Australians from around the country. Across four weeks in May and June, the ABC brought the survey data to life in its content, with major findings and themes driving the national conversation across ABC Online, TV and radio. Australia Talks culminated in a 90-minute TV special hosted by Annabel Crabb and Nazeem Hussain. An independent audience survey showed more than 43% of Australians indicated they had engaged with Australia Talks in some way. 44 43 Source: OzTAM 5 City Metro, survey weeks 22-27 2021. 44 Source: Australia Talks post-campaign review research, July 2021, (n = 1,536).Australia Talks co-host Nazeem Hussain. 52 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2021Old People's Home for 4 Year Olds The second season of the ABC's award-winning documentary series offered a lifeline for older Australians living alone at home. Old People's Home for 4 Year Olds became the ABC's No 2 non-Kids program in 2021, with complete audiences across television and ABC iview of more than 1.4 million, plus more than 9 million views of video clips on social media. The first season of the ground-breaking intergenerational experiment won an International Emmy Award for showing the physical and mental health benefits of bringing together a group of aged care residents and preschoolers. For season 2, producers turned their focus to the 1.6 million Australians over the age of 65 who live on their own at home, often experiencing loneliness and isolation. Via a purpose-built intergenerational playschool, the program explored whether social connection with a group of 4 year olds could improve the health and happiness of older Australians, enabling them to continue living in their own homes for longer. The results were outstanding. After several weeks of activities with 4 year olds, the adults were less frail or depressed. They reported improved mood, confidence, physical strength and appetite. The social experiment restored their sense of connection and fun.As ABC Managing Director David Anderson said at a special screening of the program at Parliament House in Canberra, in June 2021: \"This program symbolises the ABC at its best. Sparking national conversations about important issues. Informing, educating and entertaining Australians. Fostering positive change and social cohesion.\" The parliamentary screening, hosted by the ABC's impact partner, the Older Persons Advocacy Network (OPAN), continued a national conversation about how to support isolated older Australians living alone at home. The success of the show goes beyond audience figures. Aligned with the ABC broadcast, OPAN launched the Stay Connected and Supported in Your Community campaign. This national initiative, funded by the Commonwealth Department of Health, connects older people with information and support programs, and provides pathways for people wanting to volunteer to help older people in the community. In line with this initiative, Old People's Home for 4 Year Olds aims to improve people's wellbeing through social connection and supporting their capacity to live at home, no matter how old they are.

ABC on social media Following strong growth in ABC audiences across social platforms in 2019-20 driven by the summer bushfires and coronavirus pandemic, audiences in 2020-21 remained high, with further growth achieved in some areas. ABC's average weekly reach on third-party platforms in 2020-21 was 22.8%, up from 22.1% in 2019-20. Third-party reach was at its highest to date in March 2020 at 24.8%, driven by the interest in the COVID-19 pandemic.

For ABC's non-kids channels on YouTube, monthly unique viewers were down 15% in 2020-21, following a 72% increase the previous year. However, there was a 13% increase in monthly watch hours in 2020-21. 54 The growth in watch hours was driven largely by the ABC news livestream hosted by the ABC News Australia channel, which accounted for two-thirds of watch time for this channel in 2020-21. ABC NEWS was among the few ABC channels to increase in watch hours since 2019-20, up 36%.

Audience data and analysis 59Facebook Facebook is a key platform for the ABC to reach new audiences, and to engage in conversations about the issues that matter to Australians. Facebook is also a key referral channel driving traffic to ABC websites. In February 2021, in response to the Australian Government's proposed media bargaining laws, Facebook implemented a ban on the sharing of news content by Australian brands or audiences. This ban was in effect from 18-25 February 2021. All ABC Facebook pages were affected initially, including entertainment-based pages, some of which were reinstated during the ban. Partly as a result of the ban, monthly unique users for ABC Facebook pages were down 6% in 2020-21 compared with the previous year, to an average of 6.1 million. The ABC Sydney page had the largest monthly unique users at 864,000, followed by ABC Brisbane (839,000). ABC NEWS ranked third, with 815,000 monthly unique users, down 39% on 2019-20. Strong interest in local COVID-19 news drove increased engagement for ABC capital city and regional pages in 2020-21, and may have diverted some activity from the ABC NEWS page. The monthly unique audience across the eight ABC capital city pages was up 9% in 2020-21 to 3.3 million, while the 41 regional location pages were up 4% to 2.0 million, highlighting the important role these pages play in connecting the ABC with local communities. 58 Instagram Instagram provides an opportunity to introduce new and younger audiences to ABC content through engaging and interactive visual storytelling. ABC Instagram accounts saw 31% growth in followers in 2019-20, with 3.5 million followers 59 across all ABC Instagram accounts. The vast majority of followers are Australian and aged under 45, with a skew towards women. The triple j Instagram account had the largest number of followers in 2019-20, with 816,000, followed by ABC NEWS (698,000), ABC Australia (259,000), Gardening Australia (253,000), and ABC TV (196,000). Almost all ABC accounts experienced year-on-year growth in followers. 60 When Instagram prioritised its IGTV feature in 2019-20, ABC accounts achieved a 95% increase in video views that year, and a further 50% rise in 2020-21, with 110 million video views. 61 Radio Average weekly reach in the five-city metropolitan markets for ABC Radio (including DAB+ stations) was 5.3 million people aged over 10 years in 2020-21, up 175,000 listeners on the 2019-20 result.

Audience data and analysis 63ABC NEWS The ABC NEWS channel experienced growth across platforms in 2020-21, driven by the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. On broadcast TV, the channel maintained its position as Australia's leading 24-hour news channel with a metro and regional weekly reach of 3.7 million viewers, an increase of 6% compared with 2019-20. 86 Year-on-year growth was greater on digital platforms.

The ABC NEWS website and app and the current affairs websites recorded an average of 12.2 million weekly users in 2020-21. This was an increase of 16% on the previous year, despite the highest weekly users to date occurring in March 2020 when the national COVID-19 lockdown was announced. Weekly users in 2020-21 were highest during periods of further lockdowns across Australian states. The ABC NEWS website and app averaged more daily sessions, page views and total time spent than any other online news entity in Australia in the first six months of 2021. This is based on Nielsen Digital Media Ratings, which is the industry standard for reporting traffic volume for digital news brands in Australia. Due to a change in measurement methodology from the start of 2021, the current data set cannot be combined or compared with previous years' data, which was based on a different system of data collection. ABC NEWS ranked No 2 among Australian news brands on Facebook based on followers, with 4.4 million, behind Daily Mail Australia with 5.1 million. The ABC News page on Facebook had 815,000 monthly unique users in 2020-21, a decline of 39% compared with the previous year. 91 This decline was partly driven by Facebook's ban on the sharing of news content by Australian brands and audiences from 18-25 February 2021, in response in response to the Australian Government's proposed media bargaining laws. On YouTube, ABC news channels remained competitive despite strong growth among competitors including 60 Minutes , 9News Australia and Sky News Australia. ABC News Australia increased its subscriber count by 25% in 2020-21 to 1.4 million, while subscribers to ABC News In-Depth grew by 92% to 659,000. 92 ABC NEWS remained the leading Australian news brand on Instagram by a large margin with 687,000 followers in 2020-21. This was up 32% on the previous year, a higher rate of growth than most top Australian competitors on Instagram. 86 Source: OzTAM and Regional TAM consolidated 28-day data 2019-20, 2020-21.

All ABC employees are expected to model the ABC's values of integrity, respect, collegiality and innovation, and to align their conduct with the ABC Principles. The ABC Principles set clear expectations about working at the ABC as individuals, as leaders, and together. The ABC Principles are: We are ABC Straight talking People focused Accountable Open and transparent In September 2020, the ABC launched its Code of Conduct, which consolidates all the expectations and standards of workplace behaviour and conduct at the ABC into one document. It underpins key policies and guidelines that provide further guidance. To promote the Code of Conduct, the ABC launched an online learning module called 'Workplace Behaviours' that raises awareness of the standards and behaviours. The module outlines the expectations of individual staff members, what all staff should expect from each other, and what behaviour is not tolerated. All new staff at the ABC complete this module as part of an updated induction package. This year, the ABC also launched the 'Emerging Leaders' course as part of the Leadership Development suite. It covers the core leadership skills of existing and emerging leaders, and how to model the ABC Principles and values and help others to bring them to life. With the rise in remote working and learning as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ABC has strengthened its investment in online and remote working tools and development programs. Together with regular, effective communication and visible leadership that models the Code of Conduct, this effort continues to ensure behaviour matches the ABC's desired culture. Employee engagement The Employee Engagement Survey gave all employees the opportunity to provide feedback on their experience at work. The ABC achieved an engagement score of 71%, which is an increase of 2% from 69% in 2019-20. This score meets the Australian benchmark of 71%. The survey conducted in 2020-21 included targeted questions about working from home. Workplace flexibility is a key enabler of engagement, and to support this, the ABC launched expanded guidelines for working from home in February, along with additional tools for leaders, to help individuals and teams manage effective arrangements. Divisional executive teams were briefed on the engagement survey results as part of an effort to support tailored action planning and communications. Comparisons with the engagement survey conducted in 2019-20 show how activities over the past 12 months have been received in specific areas - as well as highlighting the activities that should be sustained to maintain the high levels of engagement seen in 2020-21. This information will support business decisions over the coming year, with a focus on learning and development, flexible work practices, and ensuring the ABC is diverse and reflective of the community we serve.ABC People Inside the ABC 73Capability, development and training Learning and development continued to play a critical role in supporting our people to bring the ABC Principles to life and deliver on the ABC Five-Year Plan 2020-2025 . Despite the ongoing challenges of COVID-19 restrictions, learning continued to grow in 2020-21 as the ABC fully embraced the transition to virtual learning platforms. This harnessed the flexibility of virtual platforms to provide new and improved learning opportunities. In total, 2020-21 saw 50,658 learning completions recorded, which is a 220% increase over the previous year. This significant increase was due to a combination of increased participation and improved data collection. Overall, the number of courses on offer to ABC staff grew from 220 in 2019-20 to 340 in 2020-21, a 54% increase. Many of the new courses focused on providing expanded learning pathways in relation to critical capabilities such as content creation and editorial decision-making. This allowed more employees to access relevant learning regardless of their tenure or experience level. Learning remained closely aligned with the needs of the organisation and its employees. It supported key initiatives on social media, health and safety and forms of employment. In 2020-21, employees took full advantage of the expanded catalogue, participating in 33,731 hours of learning, a 37% increase from 2019-20. This learning comprised face-to-face delivery (79 sessions), virtual delivery (867 sessions) and online learning, and covered a broad range of knowledge and skills including leadership, content making and soft skills. Participants had very positive impressions of their learning experience, with 94.7% of respondents stating they would recommend the course they had completed to others. Internally facilitated learning continued to be supplemented by additional external courses, with employees from across the organisation completing specialised external learning in areas such as four-wheel driving and drone operation.Targeted training Technological change The most significant technological change for 2020-21 was the rollout of a major upgrade to the existing organisational content management system, CoreMedia. A project team managed the design, development and roll out of learning to support this change across the organisation. In total, there were 1,418 participants in a combination of online courses and virtual sessions, with 5,288 hours of learning delivered in total. Feedback from participants was overwhelmingly positive, with an overall score of 4.38 out of 5 recorded. Editorial standards Learning in relation to editorial standards is a critical component of the ABC's learning and development offering. An introductory online course explains key concepts, and then targeted face-to-face and virtual sessions build on base knowledge to explore how editorial standards apply in specific circumstances and contexts. In 2020-21, the online introductory module was completed 460 times, representing 345 hours of learning in total. The supplementary face-to-face and virtual sessions were completed an additional 971 times, comprising 956 hours of learning. Specific focus areas for 2020-21 included editorial standards in relation to independence, accuracy and impartiality, and the reporting of hate speech and discrimination. 74 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2021Bullying, harassment and discrimination Bullying, harassment and discrimination continued to be important focus areas for learning in 2020-21, with all new employees required to complete mandatory learning in this area. Topics covered by the different courses on offer include: bullying and harassment Indigenous cultural awareness disability awareness LGBTQI+ awareness building a culture of inclusion. The ABC also developed an online course on the grievance process for employees affected by bullying, harassment and discrimination, which will be rolled out early in the next reporting period. In 2020-21, a total of 4,442 hours of learning relating to these topics was delivered, with 8,184 completions recorded for the period. Leadership The delivery of leadership development was significantly disrupted by COVID-19, with delivery put on hold for first half of 2020-21. This did, however, allow time to build out the planned expanded leadership learning pathway, which is now fully implemented. New courses developed during 2020-21 include: a new program for emerging leaders to help them better prepare to transition into a future leadership role a new program for knowledge leaders to help them better leverage their expertise and add value to the organisation a new senior leadership program expanded on the success of the virtual senior leadership conference held in late 2020 to provide monthly development activities for all senior leaders conversion of the existing 'Activate Your Leadership' and 'Accelerate Your Leadership' courses to virtual delivery.In total, 2,306 hours of leadership development were delivered across 2020-21, with 115 completions recorded for the period. Staff support A key focus for the period was to provide expanded support for ABC employees in relation to critical soft skills such as resilience, collaboration and inclusivity. This suite of courses, collectively branded as 'Self-leadership', proved to be very popular, with 1,276 hours of training delivered and 799 completions recorded for 2020-21. Learning and development during 2020-21 also focused on the increased risk of mental health issues as a result of COVID-19, with training rolled out to managers to help them identify and manage mental health within their teams. In total, 874 hours of mental health learning were provided to managers during 2020-21, with 442 attendees recorded for the period. Inside the ABC 75Diversity The ABC has a responsibility to reach all Australians and to accurately reflect its rich cultural diversity. To do this, the ABC needs a workforce with broad perspectives, backgrounds and approaches to create a strong, diverse public broadcaster. Diversity and inclusion plan The Diversity and Inclusion Plan and Elevate Reconciliation Action Plan provide a roadmap to help the ABC develop an inclusive culture. The Diversity and Inclusion Plan covers a three- year period from September 2019 to August 2022 and focuses on five key areas - cultural and linguistic diversity (CALD), Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, disability, gender and LGBTQI+. It outlines three strategic goals: a diverse workforce - to recruit, develop and retain a diverse workforce that reflects the make-up of the Australian community an inclusive workplace culture - to foster a workplace culture that is inclusive, collaborative and accountable, and supports the talent and diversity of staff inclusive content, products and services - to reflect and represent the diversity of the Australian community in the content, products and the services provided. The Diversity and Inclusion Plan sets out the following targets, which the ABC aims to reach by September 2022: 15% CALD content makers 15% CALD executives 8% 20% women technologists 50% women executives 3.6% Indigenous employees.Diversity and Inclusion Standing Committee The Diversity and Inclusion Standing Committee (DISC) is a group of diversity leads representing all ABC divisions, employee network groups and the Bonner Committee. DISC leads the development, implementation and review of the ABC's diversity and inclusion strategy. This includes: developing targets and implementing the current Diversity and Inclusion Plan supporting divisions to implement the Elevate Reconciliation Action Plan and contributing to the consultation process when the next RAP is developed supporting and championing employee network groups and their strategy plans advising, informing and escalating issues to the ABC Leadership Team as appropriate when the organisation is not meeting diversity and inclusion goals, and targets (in content, workforce and culture) elevating diversity and inclusion to ensure that executive teams are supporting and implementing the Diversity and Inclusion Plan and Elevate Reconciliation Action Plan , including ensuring that diversity and inclusion is a standing agenda item on divisional executive and commissioning meetings educating and supporting staff in relation to the ABC's Indigenous, diversity and inclusion goals where needed creating alignment, collaboration, and clarity across divisions on diversity and inclusion work championing and role modelling diversity and inclusion practice to increase organisation-wide awareness. 76 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2021Indigenous employment The ABC launched a specialist Indigenous recruitment strategy in 2020 to increase Indigenous representation across the organisation. The initiative is part of the employment objectives outlined in the Elevate Reconciliation Action Plan . These objectives include: ensuring all ABC divisions develop an action plan for reaching Indigenous employment and other Elevate Reconciliation Action Plan targets ensuring the proportion of Indigenous staff is at least as high as the proportion of the Australian Indigenous population - the ABC's Indigenous employment target for 2022 is 3.6% increasing the number of Indigenous employees in content-making, editorial and management decision-making roles at senior and executive levels encouraging awareness of potential careers at the ABC through, targeted recruitment campaigns, talent databases, industry and tertiary networks and social media campaigns maximising the retention of Indigenous employees through career development planning, mentoring, emerging and executive leadership training and mobility support contributing to the growth of Indigenous employment in the wider media industry increasing opportunities for Indigenous suppliers to work with the ABC. The Elevate Reconciliation Action Plan also champions initiatives that recognise and embrace Australia's Indigenous history and cultures. This includes a commitment to embed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages, voices and names within the ABC's programs, to ensure they become a part of the vocabulary of the nation.The Bonner Committee is the ABC's primary advisory body on issues relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff, content and communities. The Chair reports to the Managing Director on matters arising from the committee, which is formed from a mix of Indigenous and non-Indigenous staff drawn from around the country. The committee is named in honour of the first and only Indigenous ABC Board member, Senator Neville Bonner. Gender profile Women make up 54.8% of the ABC's workforce as of 30 June 2021, compared with 53.3% at 30 June 2020. Of the ABC's workforce, 44.8% are men and 0.4% identify as gender diverse. The ABC has achieved strong representation of women in the executive group, with 51.4% women executives against a target of 50%. There are 20.5% of women technologists against a target of 20%.

The ABC is also a member of the Champions of Change Coalition - a globally recognised innovative strategy to achieve gender equality. As part of this coalition's National 2016 Group, the ABC is committed to delivering change and achieving equal representation of gender in leadership positions. The ABC marked International Women's Day with an online event hosted by NEWS on the 50:50 project, which tracks diversity in content. Many of the ABC's radio networks, including ABC Classic, Radio National, triple j and the eight capital city stations, featured women presenters throughout the day, along with women guests and artists. Inside the ABC 77Other diversity initiatives The ABC has won multiple Australian LGBTQ Inclusion Awards and the coveted title of Gold Employer for its achievements in creating a more inclusive workplace and more diverse content for all Australians. The awards are based on the Australian Workplace Equality Index, which measures the impact of LGBTQ inclusion initiatives in organisations. The Diversity Advocates Network was established in 2021 to support staff who have a workplace issue involving diversity considerations. Advocates in the network are allies to their diverse colleagues and actively foster a culture of inclusivity in their workplaces. The network also works closely with employee network groups to assist with the development of training, awareness campaigns and frameworks that help the ABC support diversity in the workplace.Employee network groups - ABC Belong, ABC Pride and ABC Inclusive - engage regularly with staff. In 2020-21, this included the following events: ABC Belong hosted a virtual Lunar New Year celebration in February 2021. In March 2021, the ABC recognised Harmony Day with a streamed interview of political theorist and Australia's former Race Discrimination Commissioner Professor Tim Soutphommasane, conducted by Jeremy Fernandez.

Work-related WHS incidents During 2020-21, 11 incidents were reported to Comcare (including four COVID-19 incidents).Notices and investigations Comcare conducted an inspection of concerns raised by the Australian Workers Union relating to rostering and fatigue management. Comcare found that the ABC complied with its duties under the WHS Act and WHS Regulations with respect to the scope of the inspection. Several recommendations were raised for consideration by the ABC, including to review systems for managing psychosocial risks associated with roster changes, such as worker stress and anxiety, and to review systems for worker consultation to ensure all relevant WHS matters are discussed in WHS committee meetings. Outstanding commitments as of 30 June 2021 To consider the recommendations of Comcare's inspection report outlined above.

Analysis of the accepted claims in 2020-21 shows injuries/conditions were primarily due to physical injuries including body stressing, or injuries from falls, slips and trips in the workplace or in the course of work. A growing trend in injury mechanism during 2020-21 is claims related to long-term noise exposure from retired ABC staff.Workers compensation premiums The ABC's workers' compensation premium for 2020-21 was $2,154,167 (excluding GST). Comcare's indicative premium calculation for the 2021-22 year is $3,325,153. The overall Commonwealth premium rate for all Commonwealth agencies reduced from 0.85% in 2020-21 to 0.79% in 2021-22. The ABC's indicative prescribed premium rate for 2021-22 is 0.60% (up from up from .51% in 2020-21). The change reflects higher than expected ABC claims costs for 2018-19 and 2019-20.

This is supported by the Cyber Safety Hub, which houses practical tips to support staff, including support options, self-care resources, platform-specific advice and training resources. This year, a section supporting moderator wellbeing was added. The resource focuses on resilience and using technology for psychological preparedness in moderation. Employees are always encouraged to speak with their manager if they are struggling with moderation, to build awareness and ensure support is available. In May 2021, the ABC held a Cyber Safety Summit, leading the conversation for the media industry on this important issue for our staff and audience safety. The summit focused on workable solutions to problems currently faced within the media industry. The Social Media Wellbeing Advisor ran training sessions across the ABC on key cyber safety skills and onboarding key teams, on request from producers. The ABC also offers on-demand social media self-defence training for content makers. In the coming reporting period, peer supporters will be upskilled to understand cyber safety trends. A number of mental health training sessions on psychological resilience, self-care and vicarious trauma were delivered upon request. These sessions focus on increasing awareness of specific work-related stressors and psychological risks, and the identification and development of strategies to manage these. The ABC's Employee Assistance Program provider, Converge International, delivered mental health training for managers with the aim of equipping managers to monitor and support the psychological wellbeing of staff. These sessions were well received and delivered to more than 90% of ABC managers. The Peer Support Program will also be expanded. This will provide greater scope, geographical reach and demographic representation. It is anticipated by December 2021, there will be 200 active peer supporters across the organisation. Peer supporters are trained to assist their colleagues in relation to trauma, cyber safety and general mental health issues including, bullying, harassment and discrimination. The Foreign Correspondent's Program has been improved to boost monitoring and support of the psychological wellbeing of international staff during their deployment and reintegration on their return to Australia. Enforceable undertaking The ABC entered into an Enforceable Undertaking (EU) with the Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) in June 2020 in connection with underpayments to some ABC employees. As part of the EU, the ABC has committed to a number of measures to ensure future compliance with Commonwealth workplace relations laws. Many of these requirements have been met or are underway and on track to deadlines set by the FWO. A contrition payment of $600,000 was paid to the Commonwealth Consolidated Revenue Fund. The ABC rectified all underpayments to past and current employees, and provided reimbursement of costs associated with seeking independent financial advice for employees owed $15,000 and above. Any amounts unable to be paid to past employees who could not be located were transferred to the Commonwealth Consolidated Revenue Fund. Independent assessment by an external independent expert of the methodology and calculations made to impacted employees is in progress. 82 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2021 All offers of employment include the classification, schedule, band, pay point an employee will be engaged at, and an hourly rate or annual salary the employee will receive. Training for all responsible individuals regarding the rights and responsibilities of employers under relevant Commonwealth workplace laws and instruments has been completed and incorporated into the onboarding process for all new employees where applicable. The first of three annual audits was conducted by an external independent expert to confirm ongoing compliance with Commonwealth workplace laws. A systems and processes review was conducted by an external independent expert to assess payroll and record-keeping systems compliance with Commonwealth workplace laws and compliance with Schedule D of the ABC Enterprise Agreement. Recommendations were made by the external expert to ensure high standards in approaches to employee relations and payroll processes, and these have been implemented by the ABC. Implementation of an electronic record-keeping system to accurately record rosters and actual time worked for all staff is underway, and is on track for delivery by June 2022.COVID-19 recovery The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in considerable change to the way, and where, ABC staff perform their work. The ABC's response has been swift yet cautious, adjusting operations and increasing investment in the range of support to workers, so they can continue to deliver outstanding content and services. The effect on the ABC's workforce has been closely monitored, drawing on advice from health authorities, government and emerging practice to ensure appropriate steps are taken in accordance with specialist advice. The ABC has undertaken all reasonably practicable steps to ensure working arrangements comply with safe workplace regulations in each state and territory, as outlined in the ABC's COVIDSafe Plan. The ABC has taken many steps to minimise the risk of infection in the workplace, including work from home arrangements, regular cleaning of workplaces, promoting physical distancing and personal hygiene practices, workstation layout and room occupancy planning, supplying sanitisers and personal protective equipment (PPE), and strict arrangements for visitors, including temperature checks at locations with security staff. A process has also been established for reporting, tracking and managing suspected cases of infection, as well as people needing to self-isolate or undertake precautionary testing. The ABC has also taken additional steps to manage the risks for those 'vulnerable workers' identified to be most at risk of serious illness if they are infected with COVID-19, including older employees and staff from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander backgrounds. The range of wellbeing support has been expanded as the ABC continues to closely partner with its Employee Assistance Provider, Converge International, to ensure targeted and effective support is provided where it is needed most. Inside the ABC 83Regular and effective communications at both a national and local level have kept all employees well informed of the ongoing management of these unpredictable circumstances and changes, and a consistent reminder of where support is available. Coupled with regular updates and check-ins from managers, the People and Culture helpdesk also provided a dedicated and central source of information and support for employees on all matters relating to the pandemic. The helpdesk was bolstered at peak times of change throughout the pandemic to ensure timely and effective support for staff. In addition, the ABC focused on building a sense of belonging and connection for employees affected by lockdown, in order to minimise the impact of isolation. The communication strategy delivers both national, state and territory messaging to reflect the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on different states and territories. In July 2020, the ABC announced a major restructure of most ABC teams to achieve the objectives of the ABC Five-Year Plan 2020-25 and to meet required savings targets. The restructure resulted in 227 redundancies and other significant changes to teams. Given the impact and challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the range and delivery of support services normally provided during major workplace change was altered and expanded to ensure effectiveness. This included providing immediate rapid response support and a 48-hour call-back service, in addition to the usual Employee Assistance Program provided by Converge International, as well as proactive contact to every employee notified of redundancy by Trevor Roberts, the ABC's outplacement program provider, and training to support managers required to deliver difficult messages to their teams.Workplace flexibility, including work from home Like many other organisations, the proportion of employees working from home significantly increased due to the pandemic. Despite the suddenness of the initial change, existing work from home guidelines and other worker health and safety resources supporting work from home arrangements meant the ABC achieved minimal disruption while managing the change and supporting employees. During the ABC's COVID-19 response, teams adapted their thinking and planning, so content could continue to be made available to our audiences. This shows the workforce's capability to operate flexibly. In response to the engagement survey results and employees indicating desire to continue working from home in some capacity, the working from home guidelines were updated, and expanded guidance, training and tools were implemented to support the effective management of working from home arrangements. Training and development The ABC responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by expanding its range of tools, information and learning options for all managers and employees. A dedicated intranet page for all COVID-19 related information provided updates and the latest internal news during the pandemic response and recovery. The Wellness Hub was created to provide staff with information and resources to support health and wellbeing, including links to support services and networks. To support remote learning, the ABC expanded the range of courses offered virtually rather than face-to-face, growing from 42 in June 2020 to 190 in Jun 2021. This shift to online delivery was also reflected in completion statistics, with face-to-face training down to 2% from 22% and virtual training up from 7% to 19%. 84 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2021New learning programs developed during the year included: an online module housing all critical information on ABC's COVID-19 recovery, including for workers returning onsite, security and visitor protocols, relevant health and safety procedures, guidance on supporting vulnerable and at-risk workers and protocols for a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 an instructor-led workshop on managing working from home that focuses on the ABC's guidelines for working from home and how managers can apply them, and things to consider when developing team strategies to enable remote work mental health programs described earlier building leadership capability in managing hybrid and remote workforces. Checklists for managers supported the transition to hybrid models combining working on site and at home, and these will be expanded in the future. The ABC also provided training programs on individual leadership skills across all levels as part of the leadership pathway, and the challenges of the pandemic gave a pertinent focal point for discussion and reflection. Accessibility was vital to ensuring all employees could continue to contribute to organisational goals. This included enhancing tools developed through years of managing and leading a dispersed workforce, and leaders at all levels focused on clear communication to ensure teams and divisions remained united. The ABC remains committed to strategies that increase the flexibility of its workforce and the lessons learnt over the past year will continue to be built upon to a grow a stronger ABC. Inside the ABC 85Editorial quality ABC editorial policies The ABC editorial policies and associated guidance outline the principles and set the standards that govern ABC content. They are a day-to-day reference point for content makers and are critical to the ABC's ability to meet its statutory obligations and the expectations of audiences. They provide the basis for the ABC Code of Practice, which the ABC provides to the industry regulator, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). In addition, the editorial policies give practical shape to statutory obligations in the ABC Act, in particular the obligations to provide service of a high standard; maintain independence and integrity; and ensure that the gathering and presentation of news and information is accurate and impartial according to the recognised standards of objective journalism. Editorial management and guidance No changes were made to editorial policies, but existing guidance was revised, including: Removing Online Content https://edpols.abc. net.au/guidance/removing-online-content/ , revised 1 December 2020 (substantial rewrite, adding limited categories for modification, anonymisation, or removal) Domestic Violence & Abuse https://edpols. abc.net.au/guidance/domestic-violence/ , revised 8 December 2020 (reformatting and substantial rewrite) Personal Use of Social Media Guidelines https://edpols.abc.net.au/guidance/guidelines-for-personal-use-of-social-media/ , revised 26 March 2021 (substantial rewrite including standards and new links - sits under the ABC Code of Conduct) Differentiating Between Factual Reporting, Analysis and Opinion https://edpols.abc.net. au/guidance/differentiating-between-factual-reporting-analysis-and-opinion/ , revised 26 March 2021 (minor changes updating links) Elections https://edpols.abc.net.au/guidance/ elections/ revised 26 March 2021 (minor changes updating links) External Work and Editorial Conflicts https:// edpols.abc.net.au/guidance/external-work-and-editorial-conflicts/ , revised 26 March 2021 (minor changes updating links) Moderating User Generated Content https:// edpols.abc.net.au/guidance/moderating-user-generated-content/ , revised 26 March 2021 (minor changes updating links) Operating Official ABC Social Media Accounts https://edpols.abc.net.au/guidance/operating-official-abc-social-media-accounts/ , revised 26 March 2021 (minor changes updating links) Corrections & Clarifications https://edpols. abc.net.au/guidance/corrective-actions/ , revised 31 March 2021 (minor changes updating links). No changes were made to the ABC Code of Practice in 2020-21. Editorial reviews The ABC consistently reviews its own performance against the editorial standards. Content makers and program teams regularly review their own work, and the ABC also commissions reviews that are independent of content makers and carried out by a range of internal and external reviewers. The 2020-201 reviews and ABC responses to those reviews are published on the 'Editorial reviews' page http://about.abc.net. au/howthe-abc-is-run/what-guides-us/abc-editorialstandards/editorial-reviews/ of the ABC's corporate website. 86 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2021Corrections and clarifications The ABC publishes a 'Corrections and clarifications' page https://www.abc.net.au/ news/corrections/ on its website that lists corrections and clarifications made to ABC content across radio, television and digital platforms, whether as a result of complaints or for any other reason. In 2020-21, 53 corrections or clarifications were published on the 'Corrections and clarifications' page (51 in 2019-20). Where online transcripts existed, editor's notes and corrections to copy were also published. Election Coverage Review Committee The Election Coverage Review Committee (ECRC) is convened during each federal, state or territory election campaign to monitor ABC coverage and ensure ABC editorial standards are met. The committee is chaired by the Editorial Director or a senior editorial policy advisor and comprises representatives from all relevant ABC divisions. It is principally a committee of review and does not supplant the usual lines of editorial authority in each division during an election campaign. For federal elections, the ECRC reviews externally commissioned share of voice data to ensure appropriate editorial balance is maintained and no single political party is disproportionately represented. This is done while recognising that there are a range of factors which can and will affect the amount of time or share of voice of each party.For state and territory elections, the ECRC monitors content, internal records and feedback to ensure editorial balance. Audience complaints related to election coverage are reviewed by the Committee and the Chair of the ECRC is also responsible for administering the free broadcast time allocated to eligible political parties. Broadcast slots are provided on television and radio for policy announcements by political parties who meet the eligibility criteria. The Election Coverage Review Committee was convened for the following state and territory elections in 2020-21: Northern Territory August 2020 Australian Capital Territory October 2020 Queensland October 2020 Western Australia March 2021 Tasmania May 2021. Inside the ABC 87Corporate services Audience In 2020-2021, the Audience team focused on brand-building activities including: providing audience insight and understanding to the ABC, to inform effective audience-centric and on-brand decision making building the awareness and value of the ABC brand with all Australians through the prioritisation and communication of relevant and distinctive content and services showcasing the quality, accessibility and trustworthiness of ABC NEWS (a core pillar of the ABC brand and particularly pertinent during the COVID-19 period) developing ways to better connect with all Australians by ensuring inclusive and accessible communications, fostering local connection through community events and evolving ABC's personalisation capabilities to facilitate more tailored and pertinent communications deepening and evolving audience understanding and engagement. The team developed new analytical insights, based on more detailed and high-volume data driven by digital usage and profiles. Strategy In 2020-21, the Corporate Strategy team implemented the ABC Five-Year Plan , developed during the previous year. This process included communicating with teams and assisting them with strategic and business plans to make sure they align with the Five-Year Plan and other planning. Corporate Strategy also coordinated the ABC's submission in response to the Australian Government's Media Reform Green Paper and other major inquiries. It contributed to strategic reviews and efficiency projects across the ABC.In May 2021, the ABC created a new International Services team that brought together its previous International Strategy and International Development functions. The combined team will provide a coordinated approach to delivering services for communities in the Indo-Pacific region. Legal Services In 2020-21, ABC Legal provided quality legal services to the ABC through the dedicated work of its specialist teams, including by: providing around the clock prepublication advice to journalists and content makers on breaking news, investigations, podcasts and general programming, together with specialist legal briefings to program teams handling legal complaints, defending defamation claims, and managing litigation, including challenging suppression order applications making and contributing to submissions on law reform matters including appearing at hearings and inquiries (see Appendix 9 on page 216 for a list of submissions) regulatory advice work on privacy, freedom of information, public interest disclosures, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act and the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act drafting and contracting finance, production and rights agreements, and providing intellectual property and commercial law advice drafting and negotiating technology contracts and the acquisition of hardware, software and support services advising on construction matters and property management and maintenance contracts drafting content licensing, book and magazine publishing, and music recording, licensing and publishing agreements 88 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2021 providing rights management services, including supporting a new rights management system, co-ordinating the ABC's music reporting, undertaking copyright clearances, providing rights assessments for re-use and supply, rights audits for ABC Commercial, the Rights Hotline service, and coordinating repeat fees and residuals for programs, projects and services preparing and delivering training on privacy, media law updates and rights management undertaking automation of various legal documents.

Inside the ABC 8990 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2021Responsibility 7.30 host Leigh Sales.In this section: Corporate responsibility 92 Environmental responsibility 96Social responsibility 100Responsibility 91The ABC is committed to corporate responsibility and aims to deliver content with integrity, diligence and transparency, and to act in the interests of citizens. Delivering products and services that satisfy the needs and expectations of audiences, and that meet the ABC's editorial standards, is the essence of the ABC's existence. The ABC is committed to fulfilling its corporate objectives across all business and media activities in a manner that is ethically and financially responsible, and in particular pursues environmentally and socially responsible business practices. The values of integrity, respect, collegiality and innovation are the foundation of the ABC's activities. Reporting performance The ABC reports its corporate responsibility and sustainability performance each financial year in the Annual Report , with additional information available in the Diversity and Inclusion Report , and then throughout the year on the Corporate Responsibility webpage http://about.abc.net.au/how-the-abc-is-run/whatguides-us/corporate-responsibility/ . Other than references to the ABC's international activities, the Annual report is limited to domestic operations within the direct control of the ABC. Sustainability information about the ABC's investments in MediaHub Australia Pty Limited, Freeview Australia Limited and National DAB Licence Company Limited is not included in the report. Any additional limitations to the scope or completeness of particular data are identified within the reported data. Stakeholder inclusiveness The ABC provides varied opportunities for its audiences and other stakeholders to provide input into its content and activities. In 2019-20, mechanisms for engaging with external stakeholders included: the ABC Corporate Tracking Program the ABC Quality and Distinctiveness Study (via YourABC) formal audience contacts and complaints processes - see page 115 ABC Advisory Council processes see page 108 online feedback mechanisms specific to ABC content areas the ABC's social media properties. Protecting freedom of expression Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognises freedom of expression as a fundamental human right. Freedom of expression is enshrined in the ABC Editorial Policies. The ABC's commitment to impartiality and diversity of perspectives reflects the importance of diverse sources of reliable information and a plurality of views within a healthy democracy. In pursuing impartiality, the ABC is guided by the following: a balance that follows the weight of evidence fair treatment open-mindedness opportunities over time for principal relevant perspectives on matters of contention to be expressed. The ABC seeks to balance the public interest in disclosure of information and freedom of expression with respect for privacy.Corporate responsibility 92 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2021Press freedom The ABC is a founding member of the Global Task Force for Public Media (GTF) and an active participant in this key body, established in 2020 to defend the values and the interests of public media. The GTF offers an industry-led approach to key issues affecting public broadcasters around the world, a perspective that spans countries, languages, and cultures. There are eight members including the ABC: ZDF (Germany), France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions (France), BBC (United Kingdom), RNZ (New Zealand), SVT (Sweden), KBS (South Korea) and CBC/Radio-Canada, GTF Chair (Canada). The GTF is currently chaired by Catherine Tait, President & CEO of CBC/Radio-Canada. The GTF provides a way for the ABC and its fellow public broadcasters to support one another's work at a time when public broadcasting and press freedom is under attack in so many jurisdictions. Over the past 12 months, the GTF has voiced concerns about the dramatic increase in both the frequency and the intensity of harassment and intimidation faced by journalists worldwide, including during the attack on the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. in January; the decision of the government of the People's Republic of China to ban BBC World News from broadcasting in February; and other examples of significant destabilising pressure applied to media in countries such as Slovenia and the Czech Republic. Press freedom remains a concern in Australia itself. In 2021 Australia was ranked 25 in the annual World Press Freedom Index, published by Reporters Without Borders. The ABC's commitment to public broadcasting, public interest journalism, and a strong media culture to support Australian democracy is unswerving and is a key part of the ABC Five-Year Plan .Accessibility of content and services The ABC provides audio-described content for a selection of broadcast television programs. In its first year from launch to 30 June 2021, the ABC broadcast 949 hours of unique audio-described content at its first or first-possible release across its broadcast multichannels. This is 130% of its annual target (728 hours). The ABC chooses audio-described content according to suitability and priority. Suitable content contains visual material that is necessary for understanding and has sufficient space to insert it in gaps in the primary audio. Selected content included: 418 hours of feature drama like Operation Buffalo , Jack Irish and Wakefield 108 hours of documentary such as Australia's Ocean Odyssey , Australia Remastered and Love On The Spectrum 90 hours of factual programs including Gardening Australia , Grand Designs and Old People's Home for 4 Year Olds 190 hours of children's content like Bluey , Play School and Little J and Big Cuz . On New Year's Eve, ABC Radio broadcast a live audio description of the Sydney fireworks that was available nationally on local radio stations, the ABC listen app and also on the radio reading service 2RPH. The ABC also produced a guide to posting accessible photos on Facebook for social media producers across the organisation. This will help social media producers make content that is more accessible for the ABC's diverse audiences. Responsibility 93Protecting young or vulnerable audiences The ABC takes seriously its role of protecting young or vulnerable people from harmful content and practices. The ABC's Editorial Policy framework sets out guidelines to protect vulnerable audiences such as children. Advice and training in the ABC Editorial Policies is delivered on an ongoing basis (see page 86). Upward referral - a key concept within the policies - ensures complex decisions are not made in isolation. All television programs other than news, current affairs and sporting events, are classified and scheduled for broadcast in accordance with the ABC's Associated Standard on Television Program Classification. The ABC ensures that graphic or distressing news content is preceded by a warning, to give readers, listeners or viewers the opportunity to avoid the content if they choose. triple j has strategies in place to ensure its younger audiences are protected from harm. Editorial content which is likely to cause harm or offence to younger sections of the audience is scheduled in appropriate time periods such as later in the evening. Warnings are given before playing music containing language or content that is assessed as likely to offend the triple j audience and prior to other types of content which risk causing harm to vulnerable audiences. Content created especially for children and available on ABC iview or apps is accompanied by classification advice and warnings where appropriate. As with broadcast, children's content on digital properties is restricted to G and PG. Classification has progressively exhibited heightened sensibilities with respect to editorial concerns in children's programming, which has led to a significant increase in the number of episodes being referred for review. There is far greater oversight of children's programming in terms of the content's compliance with non-classification matters, such as ABC Editorial Policies.Both the ABC KIDS iview and ABC ME apps, along with the main ABC iview service, include a parental filter so parents can control their children's viewing boundaries. The ABC's websites and apps for children follow strict protocols to minimise risk to children and protect their privacy. The ABC believes online protection of children and young people under the age of 18 is a shared responsibility between the ABC, the parent or guardian, and the child, and aims to ensure that children and young people who engage with the ABC's online spaces understand the possible risks they face and how to minimise them. Digital literacy ABC Education's Media Literacy website https:// www.abc.net.au/education/media-literacy/ provides resources for primary and high school aged students to improve their understanding of and ability to navigate media and information. The content aims to advance teachers' and students' skills in detecting and being aware of disinformation and misinformation. In 2020, this included the addition of a guide to statistical literacy developed with the University of Tasmania. In October 2020, ABC Education partnered with the newly formed Australian Media Literacy Alliance (AMLA) to run the ABC's third Media Literacy Week. This event brought together Australia's leading cultural and educational institutions to advocate for high-quality education programs and resources and to raise awareness of the need for robust media literacy education for all Australians. Media Watch offers media analysis and critique through the year, both as the weekly Monday night program (on ABC TV and ABC iview), and the weekly Thursday social-first short-form video, Media Bites for ABC TV and ABC iview. This strategy of tailoring content across platforms at the start and end of each week ensures maximum coverage for scrutinising and fact checking media that our audiences-consume. 94 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2021Editorial and broadcasting responsibilities There has been no change to the classification process for this period. The Classifications team focused on small, tailored training sessions based on requests by producers and managers. During the past 12 months, the ABC reviewed all its content to remove or edit anything that did not represent safe or approved behaviour in relation to virus and disease transmission. It also increased the presence of content that modelled best safe hygiene practices - some of which was among the year's most popular content. This supports the ABC's role as educator and aligns with its key editorial policies around harm and offence and imitable behaviour. In addition, three new community manager roles have been created as part of the social content team. These roles keep our online communities safe, ensuring conversations and debates between audience members are respectful, and protect the people featured in stories from audience attacks.

Responsibility 95Environmental responsibility The ABC continued efforts to reduce its environmental footprint in 2020-21, with lower energy use and greenhouse gas emissions than the previous year. Energy The ABC's operations are by their nature energy intensive, and New South Wales features strongly in the energy consumption figures because of the concentration of production and workforce there. Nonetheless, overall energy consumption continued to decrease this year, and the ABC used 7% less energy than in 2019-20. Energy-efficient solutions are implemented wherever possible as part of general repairs and maintenance, including the installation of LED light fittings and new energy-efficient chillers in Ultimo and Canberra. Energy consumption 2020-21 Location2020-21 2019-20 % change In early 2021, the ABC commissioned an environmental and sustainability report to identify a sustainability baseline that captures all emissions across the organisation's operations. This will allow the ABC to develop appropriate and achievable emissions targets, and it will assist in the development of a sustainability roadmap to achieve these targets. An employee sustainability committee with representation from across the organisation was established this year to guide the ABC's approach to sustainability. 96 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2021Emissions 2020-21 CategoriesRaw figure and unit of measurement 2020-21 2019-20 Diesel oil / L 2,000 12,186 5.40 0 0 5 37 0 0 37 -85.41% Other building E10 / L 54,516 55,679 114 0 18 132 116 0 19 135 -2% Automotive gaso-line (petrol) / L 126,819 131,768 293 0 16 309 305 0 16 321 -4% Passenger vehicles Automotive diesel (transport) 149,310 179,498 406 0 21 427 489 0 25 513 -17% Other transport All categories 29,930 33,918 Note on emissions methodology: Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG for electricity and gas is obtained directly from suppliers' invoices, scope 3 GHG for energy (electricity and gas) and diesel consumption is calculated in accordance with 'The GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard (referred to as the Scope 3 Standard)' and The National Greenhouse Accounts (NGA) Factors prepared by the Department of the Environment and Energy October 2020.

Waste and recycling Recycled and landfill waste 2020-21 Location2020-21 reported in 2019-20 were based on forecast m3 and have been updated to reflect actual m3 in the above table. Note: The waste disposal data that informs this report is sourced from billing information of the ABC's waste contractors for the capital cities only. This method is identical to that used to report for the 2017-18 financial year. All capital cities use a contracted waste provider, who removes waste, batteries and fluorescent tubes. There are collection points for mobile phones and Planet Ark for printer and toner cartridges. Major metro sites use multiple-bin waste systems to separate waste streams. These include systems up to four bins that collect organic, co-mingled, soft plastic and landfill waste. ABC staff no longer use personal under-desk bins. Regional sites have different recycling arrangements depending on the local provider. Where available, these include multistream waste collection arrangements. Responsibility 97Environmental sustainability in the supply chain Travel and transport During 2020 and 2021, COVID-19 restrictions saw many ABC staff reduce or cancel travel to or for work. However, the nature of the ABC's operations, in particular its news and current affairs activities, often required domestic and international travel. As in other years, the ABC continued to encourage employees to reduce domestic travel as much as possible. Where possible, employees used alternatives to travel, such as video conferencing, which saw heavy use during the pandemic, particularly during lockdowns in capital cities. The ABC continued to encourage the use of sustainable travel to commute to and from work, such as walking, cycling or public transport.Most capital city and some regional sites provide end-of-trip facilities including secure bike parking, showers and lockers, and information about public transport is provided for staff on the ABC intranet. When it comes to the ABC motor vehicle fleet, the ABC views every vehicle replacement as an opportunity to improve the fleet's environmental profile by considering if there is a need to replace the vehicle or whether there is a hybrid alternative that meets operational requirements.

The EPBC Act sets out the ABC's responsibilities to protect and conserve the Commonwealth Heritage values of places that it owns or controls. The strategy is intended to inform the Minister and the Australian Heritage Council of the identification, assessment and monitoring of those places. The ABC's 2018-2021 Strategy https://about.abc.net.au/how-the-abc-is-run/what-guides-us/heritage- management/ is available online. -20.77% * Total ABC consumption captures use from all major metros and 36 out of 46 regional locations, along with one ABC house in Mount Isa.

The ABC considers the inclusion of sustainability initiatives in any refurbishments undertaken, including the viability of rainwater collection. The use of collected rainwater is not measured, however the 40% reduction in water use in Brisbane can be attributed to significant rainfall and use of the on-site tanks. Responsibility 99Social responsibility Times of emergency The ABC provides emergency broadcasting services in times of crisis. This included 212 emergency events in 2020-21, compared with 953 events the previous year. The 'Emergency broadcasting' section on page 26 has more information about the ABC's work during times of emergency. Content impact The ABC makes a difference for audiences through the impact its content has for the communities it works with, delivering cultural and social change. The 'Content, services & community' section on pages 18-53 provides more details of the way the ABC reached and influenced diverse Australian communities in 2020-21. Social responsibility in the community Community service announcements The ABC's Local Radio services broadcast community service announcements (CSAs) to assist and inform local communities. CSAs are frequently run as part of emergency broadcasting, focusing on preparation and awareness before an event and providing information after an event. CSAs are played in Indigenous languages where appropriate. In 2020-21, the ABC collaborated with Australia's national emergency warnings group and all emergency agencies across the country on a project to produce nationally consistent messaging around flooding and storms. This is being tested and will be available for broadcast later in the year.Humanitarian appeals The ABC works with Australian and international aid agencies during crises and humanitarian aid appeals when it is appropriate and possible to do so. The ABC Appeals website https://about.abc.net. au/appeals/ provides information about current crises and ways to donate. In 2020-21, the ABC supported domestic and international organisations to provide COVID-19 relief. Connecting with communities The ABC connects with communities through a wide range of broadcasting and services. One example of this is the Remote Media Literacy Program, which aims to help young people in remote parts of Western Australia and the Northern Territory to increase their media literacy. Supported by funding from the Judith Neilson Institute, the program works with high schools to build a generation of savvy media consumers and producers. In 2020-21 the program focused on delivering curriculum experiences to remote students that enable them to combat misinformation and understand how news is produced. Along with online resources for teachers, ABC reporters delivered a series of intensive in-person media literacy workshops in 15 of Australia's most remote schools. 100 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2021International development ABC International Development (ABCID) continued to adapt to COVID-19 challenges during 2020-21. In response to the pandemic, it supported media practitioners and institutions in the region to work safely and meet the information needs of audiences, including prevention. The team set up an 'infodemic tracker' to keep journalists and communications practitioners in the Pacific up to date with areas of misinformation and confusion among audiences. ABCID worked on the following projects in 2020-21: The Pacific Media Assistance Scheme undertakes media capacity-building activities across the Pacific. In 2020-21, projects included training journalists to cover regional business and economic issues, law and court reporting, and election reporting. It launched Pacific Prepared , a radio co-production with six Pacific nations on disaster preparedness that has been broadcast on ABC Radio Australia and stations across the region. ABCID worked with ABC Archives to include footage in the Pacific Virtual Museum program, which is designed to house digitised items of Pacific cultural heritage. Media Development Initiative activities in Papua New Guinea in 2020-21 included partnerships with media organisations to support content development across all formats and platforms on COVID-19 themes, press club events and capacity-building training. The project supported the COVID-19 response by producing and distributing public health messages to help prevent the spread of virus. The Women in News and Sports project trained and mentored women journalists across the Indo-Pacific to cover major regional sporting stories and events. Training topics included best-practice radio and podcast production, mobile storytelling and remote reporting ahead of the Tokyo 2021 Olympics. The Girls Online (GO!) project, under the Australian Government Cyber Cooperation Program, works with young women in Tonga and Vanuatu to develop resilience and solutions to the cyber threats they face online. The SAFE project provides technical assistance to behaviour change communication initiatives in six Pacific countries to enable informed decision-marking on sexual and reproductive health issues, working with partners in the United Nations Population Fund's Transformative Agenda funded by Australia Aid. ABCID worked with disability organisations to promote inclusive disaster reporting and media coverage in Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and Timor-Leste. This is part of the Australian Government's Australian Humanitarian Partnership. The Climate Story Telling project involves partnerships and effective information sharing between Pacific media and climate change bodies and experts. It aims to improve media coverage across the region and is part of the Australia Pacific Climate Partnership.

Overall, Council members found the content engaging and interesting, with a good balance of topics and diverse perspectives. New ABC Advisory Council member Brendan Whitely in Wandering, WA. Accountability 111The Council made the following recommendations: Assist audiences to quickly access segments of interest by making online and podcast versions of local radio programs easier to search and navigate, for example, by time-stamping segments or providing searchable transcripts. Greater promotion to increase awareness of programs on the ABC listen app, as a large market share do not own or use radios, particularly those in younger demographics. Consider a regular podcast with highlights of The Country Hour . The recommendations have been taken into account in the following initiatives: The ABC's Audio Strategy project is focusing on segmentation and discoverability of audio content. Programs on the ABC listen app are cross-promoted on social media, where they reach broad demographics and non-radio audiences. Podcasts are also available on Apple Podcasts and other commercial podcast apps, reaching audiences beyond the ABC's own platforms. The ABC is trialling podcasts on Spotify to reach different audiences, particularly younger people. Highlights from The Country Hour around Australia are already showcased for podcast audiences on Country Breakfast . This weekly program is available on demand on the ABC listen app and other commercial podcast apps, and for a broadcast audience on Radio National.Members provided specific feedback about their local ABC Radio breakfast program and local ABC Facebook pages. No recommendation was made to the Board. Feedback included the following observations: Content in regional areas was more local in focus than metropolitan areas. Although there was less local content in metro areas, the balance favouring national stories was felt to be appropriate. Community members tended to be listening to radio less often, with audio on demand preferred. Awareness of the ABC Facebook page was low. However, it received positive feedback. Many community members indicated that they would continue to follow the page now they were aware of it. Social media content was perceived as more light hearted, and there was appreciation for the diversity represented in images on social media. Hyper-local content was accompanied by great imagery, local perspectives and a community sense that was engaging. Local stories were refreshing in the midst of US election and COVID pandemic media coverage. The postcode option to filter content on the ABC news website could be made more apparent. The Advisory Council is currently considering any recommendations it may make in relation to Insiders , 7.30 and Radio National Breakfast . 112 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2021Risk The Board recognises that risk management and internal compliance and control are vital to effective governance. The ABC's Risk Management Policy and Resilience Policy describe how the ABC: consistently applies processes to recognise and manage risks and disruptions confers responsibility on ABC employees at all levels to identify, manage, review and report on risks relating to the objectives those staff are accountable for delivering. Risk is inherent to the ABC's operations. Like all broadcasters, the ABC must adapt to technological changes, shifts in demographics, evolving audience demands and structural changes in the media and entertainment industry. As one of Australia's most important civic and cultural institutions, the ABC also faces unique public expectations and financial challenges. In addition, its response to the challenges of COVID-19 continues to evolve. The ABC uses a standardised enterprise-wide risk management process to identity, assess, monitor and manage significant risks. Disruption is managed using the Prevention, Preparedness, Response and Recovery Model. The Risk and Resilience function is responsible for risk management and resilience capability. In 2020-21, the Leadership Team and the Audit & Risk Committee reviewed the ABC's risk profile and received regular risk management reports and resilience information. These reports considered the ABC's people, audience, reputation, financial, technology, legal and compliance exposures. Additional reporting examined the operational consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. A review of the ABC's risk appetite was also completed. This supports and informs Board and management decision-making in accordance with the ABC's Five-Year Plan 2020-2025 . Appendix 2 on pages 188-189 provides more detail on the activities of the Audit & Risk Committee.Insurance The ABC has acquired appropriate insurances from Comcover, including directors and officers liability insurance.

Board members were permitted to vote on the Deed pursuant to a declaration by the Minister for Communications under s. 15 of the PGPA Act. Accountability 113Group Audit has a key role within the ABC's governance framework. It reports independently to the Audit & Risk Committee and contributes to the achievement of the ABC's goals and objectives by: providing objective assurance of the design and operation of the ABC's internal controls, including recommending improvements to management playing a role in developing and maintaining a culture of accountability and integrity, including conducting investigations in relation to fraud or public interest disclosure allegations responding to the ABC's changing requirements and applying a continuous improvement mindset, including using technologies and data to assess internal control performance. Group Audit prepares and delivers the ABC's Audit Plan, which is approved by the Audit & Risk Committee. A risk-based audit approach is adopted to ensure Group Audit focuses its work on the ABC's key strategic objectives and operational areas. Group Audit works closely with Group Risk to ensure that all aspects of risk are considered in the development of the risk-based Audit Plan, including operational, strategic, people, and financial risk. Audits are conducted in accordance with international auditing standards. In 2020-21, Group Audit completed 23 audit assignments (24 in 2019-20), covering editorial, content delivery, operational, finance, information technology, risk management, privacy, health and safety, and project management processes. Group Audit uses in-house employees and external providers to deliver the Audit Plan. External providers provide expertise in specialist areas, supplementing internal resources and experience.

This includes seeking advice on proposed areas of focus and ensuring minimal duplication of audit coverage.The ABC complies with the Privacy Act 1988 and the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs). The ABC Privacy Policy is published on the 'Privacy' page of the ABC website.

Notification must be made to the affected individuals and the regulator. In 2020-21, the ABC did not experience any data breaches that required notification to the Privacy Commissioner.Audit Privacy 114 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2021Editorial complaints management Audience and Consumer Affairs Written complaints that are potentially editorial - about issues such as factual inaccuracy, bias or inappropriate content - are referred to Audience and Consumer Affairs, a unit independent of ABC program areas. If a written complaint suggests the ABC may have breached its editorial policies or Code of Practice, Audience and Consumer Affairs assesses the complaint to determine appropriate handling in accordance with the ABC's complaint handling procedures. Audience and Consumer Affairs may investigate the complaint and determine whether ABC editorial standards have been met. If the matters raised are less serious, Audience and Consumer Affairs may refer the complaint for direct handling to the content area responsible. In cases where a complaint is investigated and the ABC's editorial standards have not been met, the complaint will be upheld (either fully or in part). Complaints can also be resolved where prompt action is taken to remedy a matter. Overall complaint handling During 2020-21, Audience and Consumer Affairs assessed 7,592 written complaints. The unit provided a personal response to 2,206 of these complaints. 2,579 complaints were referred to other areas of the ABC for direct response. No substantive response was required for 2,807 complaints. Editorial complaint handling Of the 7,592 complaints assessed by Audience and Consumer Affairs, 3,841 were determined to be editorial (raising 4,176 issues). The unit investigated 1,568 editorial complaints (raising 1,891 issues), provided responses to 50 editorial complaints that did not require investigation, referred 2,209 editorial complaints to content areas for direct response, and closed 14 editorial complaints after acknowledgement. Nature of editorial complaint issues Subject Issues % total Factual inaccuracy 1,232 29.5% Bias (other than party political)*883 21.1% Unfair treatment 618 14.8% Party political bias 579 13.9% Inappropriate content 462 11.1% Other 231 5.5% Lack of balance 171 4.1% Total 4176 100.0% * Includes claims of bias in relation to issues such as international coverage, sport and religion. Outcome of investigated complaints During 2020-21, 78 editorial complaint issues were upheld (4.1% of all investigated issues) in cases where Audience and Consumer Affairs determined that ABC editorial standards had not been met. A further 265 issues were resolved (14.0% of all investigated issues) after the relevant content area took prompt and appropriate action to remedy the cause of the complaint. All findings in relation to upheld and resolved complaints are brought to the attention of the senior editorial staff responsible. In 2020-21, actions taken in response to upheld and resolved complaints included: written apologies to complainants on-air and online corrections counselling or other action with staff changing or removing content correction of material on ABC Online reviews of and improvements to procedures. Summaries of upheld and resolved complaints are published on abc.net.au as individual complaints are finalised, providing timely access to complaint decisions. The ABC also publishes a quarterly statistical overview of audience contacts on its website. Accountability 115Timeliness Audience and Consumer Affairs seeks to respond to all complaints as quickly as possible, and aims to respond within 30 days of receipt, in accordance with the timeliness standard for complaint handling that is specified in the ABC's complaint handling procedures. Of the 2,206 complaints that Audience and Consumer Affairs responded to directly between 1 July 2020 and 30 June 2021, 1,795 (81.4%) received responses within 30 days. Australian Communications and Media Authority Members of the public who complain to the ABC about matters covered by the ABC Code of Practice and who are dissatisfied with the ABC's response, or who do not receive a response to their complaint within 60 days, may seek review from the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). During 2020-21, the ACMA advised the ABC that it had finalised investigations into two such matters (compared with two in 2019-20). The ACMA found that an episode of Four Corners - 'Cash Splash' - breached standards 4.1 (gather and present news and information with due impartiality) and 4.5 (do not unduly favour one perspective over another) of the ABC Code of Practice. The ABC noted the findings, but respectfully disagreed with the ACMA's view that the episode lacked impartiality. Commonwealth Ombudsman The Ombudsman's office did not notify the ABC of any investigations into the ABC's handling of complaints that it commenced or finalised during the current reporting period.

The proportion of Australian adults who are aware of an ABC Product or Service is an important measure for the ABC. Those who have higher levels of awareness of the ABC's platforms and services place greater value on the role that the ABC plays in the community in general. ABC Platforms that have been rebranded have seen decline in awareness for the new brands (including ABC TV Plus and ABC Everyday). The ABC is increasing its efforts to connect and inform audiences to grow awareness through targeted advertising campaigns (including off-platform activity) and improving brand attribution of ABC content in third-party environments. Priority: Deliver personalised digital experiences The ABC of the future must meet audience demand for digital experiences on a wide variety of devices. This measure is tracked with user-analysis tools.

Being a trusted source of news and information is important across all aspects of the ABC. The ABC remains the most trusted media source in Australia. In March 2021, 79% of Australians trusted the information provided by the ABC - this is significantly higher than all other media institutions and information providers. The ABC will continue to prioritise building understanding and, where appropriate, enhancing the transparency of its efforts to ensure accurate and impartial journalism the Australian public can trust. Priority: Strengthen local connections Strengthening the role that the ABC plays in local communities is a key strategic priority that has grown in importance. Responses to specific survey questions are used to generate a percentage value to measure this.

Strengthening connections with local audiences is a new key performance measure stemming from the ABC's Five-Year Plan . The ABC expects to see improvements in this measure over the next 12 months through specific initiatives including new brand campaigns targeting local radio stations, rebuilding our Emergency Broadcasting offer through a dedicated ABC Emergency website, and increasing news presence in outer-suburban areas to produce more relevant news stories for communities we typically underserve. Priority: Prioritise quality over quantity The ABC needs to maintain high standards and stand out as a unique provider of Australian content. Various measures are aggregated to provide a percentage score for this. Measure Measure Source Data Source2020-21 Target2020-21 Result2019-20 Result Quality quality over quantity.

Producing and sharing distinctive content is an important consideration for all public broadcasters, including the ABC. Currently 83% of the ABC's audience feels that the content that they have watched, read or listened to was distinctive. Our audiences increasingly connected with the ABC through news; however, it is the least distinctive of our products (79%) given similar news exists in other places and news formatting is relatively consistent across providers. Highly distinctive content produced includes Planet America , Back Roads , Landline , Sammy J , In My Blood It Runs , Media Watch , Radio National and triple j. The ABC will increase its focus on showcasing programs that appeal to uniquely Australian stories, interest and perspectives. Priority: Invest in the workforce of the future Employee engagement surveys provide detailed data and insights for leaders and managers to use to improve the workplace. Organisational responsiveness to employee feedback leads to higher retention rates, lower absenteeism, improved productivity, higher service levels and better employee morale. Also, as Australia's foremost cultural institution, it is the ABC's purpose to inspire and enrich the lives of all Australians. As the national broadcaster, it is incumbent on the Corporation to show leadership in advancing reconciliation.

This measure identifies that the majority of audiences, for most of the year, were provided ABC transmission services. Television and analogue radio service performance improved over the previous year. This was significantly influenced by the more benign weather experienced over the year. The cause of decline in overall performance reported here was due to the long delays in repairing the Class E Digital Radio services that are under a contract for digital radio services originally built by commercial radio broadcasters to provide low-powered infill transmission services. These services do not have the same standby power and other facilities as the fully managed services and are provided on a break and fix maintenance contract. 126 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2021Measure Measure Source Data Source2020-21 Target2020-21 Result2019-20 Result Operation of transmission facilitiesABC from BAI Communications Australia100% 100% 99.91% Analysis: Target met.

If a transmitter was operational during the period for one or more days, it is included in the report. Transmitter numbers for digital television do not include the six standby transmitters operated in Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Newcastle, Perth, and Sydney, which operate as a backup to the main transmitter in those areas. 2. BAI Communications Transmission Network (ABC Transmission Contractor): The transmission network performance data is reported by BAI Communications in the period from 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021. This is a contracted deliverable and is measured against the Service Level Agreement (SLA) for each service, network, or sub national network. The data is regularly reviewed and authenticated by ABC Transmission Network Services. There are 13 Class E digital radio services that are provided by BAI Communications for the ABC where contract performance is not measured as a target of overall uptime. These services are provided to equalise audience experience across both national and commercial and community broadcasters. 3. Total Network Availability shows the impact of all outages on the overall network: This reflects all faults across the transmission networks regardless of severity or cause or whether subject to a Service Level Agreement (SLA) or not. The vast majority of these faults are services not meeting full specification such as lower transmission power as agreed by the ABC on a case by case basis. 4. Total 'On-Air' Availability: The figures show 'off-air' occurrences where no service was provided due to faults and/or maintenance activity. It is important to note that the majority of maintenance activity is undertaken after midnight to reduce audience impact. 5. RBA Holdings Transmission Network (Self Help Services): The transmission network performance data is reported by RBA Holdings in the period 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021. This is a contracted deliverable and is provided for ABC information purposes to record outage times and respond to audience requests for information. These services are provided to equalise audience experience across regional Australia. 6. RBA Holdings Reporting Quality: The RBAH provided transmission services do not have the same reporting obligations as BAI Communications' National Transmission Network. Maintenance operator data provided by RBAH is incomplete. The ABC has relied upon the MediaHub off-air fault reports for RBAH facilities in the 2021 financial year. RBAH has undertaken to implement performance reporting improvements. Gardening Australia host Costa Georgiadis.

From this total, $15.2m was reinvested into content to ensure the ABC continues to meet the needs of our audience in a changing media environment. The Year Ahead Revenue from Government 2021-22 is the third year of the current funding Triennium, and the third and final year of the three-year funding continuation for Enhanced News Gathering. It is the third year impacted by the three-year pause to indexation of ABC General Operational Activities base funding, announced by Government in the May 2018 Budget as part of the 'Funding for Australian Film and Television Content and the National Broadcasters' measure. This results in a reduction of $41.3million in 2021-22 and a total reduction of $83.7m over the three years 2019-20 to 2021-22, with an ongoing reduction to the funding base of $41.3m per annum in future years beyond 2021-22.

As outlined above, 2021-22 represents the last year of continued Enhanced News Gathering funding as well as the third and final year impacted by the operational funding indexation pause. The 2021-22 budget incorporates all efficiency savings achieved over the last two years to respond to the pause in indexation and the subsequent decline in funding in real terms. The 2021-22 Budget has been prepared in alignment with the Five-Year Plan announced by the Managing Director in June 2020, and continues the strategic focus, with savings initiatives from the prior year enabling the ABC to make necessary adjustments required to operate within a constrained funding environment, as well as enabling reinvestment in strategic priorities. While maintaining essential radio and television services, there will be an increased focus on digital/on-demand content, sport and local content to strengthen connections with local communities, Australian content across the core strategic genres of Australian drama and children's, and increased commitment to the arts. These initiatives will contribute towards achieving the Five-Year Plan priorities of delivering personalised digital experiences, remaining Australia's best and most trusted source of news and information, strengthening local connections, and prioritising quality over quantity. The ABC remains committed to prioritising available resources to enable it to most effectively deliver on its Charter obligations and remain relevant to audiences in Australia's cultural and media landscape into the future.

Accountable Authority's responsibility for the f inancial statements As the Accountable Au thority of the Entity , the Australian Broadcasting Corporation 's Board is responsible under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (the Act) for the preparation and fair presentation of annual financial statements that comply with Australian Accounting Standards - Reduced Disclosure Requirements and the rules made under the Act. The Accountable Authority is also responsible for such internal control as the Accountable Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the Accountable Authority is responsible for assessing the ability of the Entity to continue as a going concern, taking into account whether the E ntity's operations will cease as a result of an administrative restructure or for any other reason. The Accountable Authority is also re sponsible for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the assessment indicates that it is not appropriate . Financial Statements 135 Auditor's r esponsibilities for the audit of the f inancial s tatements My objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high leve l of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian National Audit Office Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with the Australian National Audit Office Auditing Standards, I exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also: identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness o f the Entity's internal control; evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Accountable Authority; conclude on the appropriateness of the Accountable Authority's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whethe r a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the E ntity's ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may ca use the E ntity to cease to continue as a going concern; and evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and eve nts in a manner that achieves fair presentation. I communicate with the Accountable Authority regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal cont rol that I identify during my audit.

Explanation of Major Variances between Actual Results and Original Budget Explanations are provided for significant variances between actual results and the budget, as reflected in the October 2020 Portfolio Budget Statements (PBS) of the ABC. Significant variances include variances of $20,000,000 or more, and variances which are otherwise materially relevant to the performance of the ABC. The budget is not audited. Values in this Note are rounded to the nearest thousand, consistent with the PBS. The ABC's Total Comprehensive Income for the financial year to June 2021 was $2,331,000. This result was $5,780,000 favourable compared to the budgeted Total Comprehensive Loss of $3,449,000. A. Cash and cash equivalents and other Investments The ABC's combined cash and cash equivalents and other investments balance at 30 June 2021 was $218,397,000. Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, cash at bank and short-term deposits with counterparties. Other investments include surplus cash invested in term deposits with an original maturity of more than three months. The cash and other investments balance of $218,397,000 was $45,196,000 higher than the budget of $173,201,000. The favourable cash and investments balance is mainly due to timing variances compared to budget in respect of cash payments. The key reasons for these timing differences are explained under items B, C and D below. B. Supplier and other payables The ABC's supplier and other payables balance at 30 June 2021 was $146,932,000. This is $16,229,000 higher than the budgeted balance of $130,703,000. The variance is mostly due to variances in the timing of high-value payments for production milestones, acquired content, marketing campaigns and royalties compared to budget. This shift in the timing of production milestone payments is mainly due to the impact of COVID-19 on production schedules. C. Employee provisions The ABC's employee provisions balance at 30 June 2021 was $156,747,000. This balance was $24,354,000 higher than the budgeted amount of $132,393,000. The variance was partly due to the timing of payments from the provision raised for historical wage and superannuation entitlements owed to employees. These payments were budgeted to occur in 2021 and are now expected to be made in 2022. In addition, the balance of employee leave provisions at 30 June 2021 was higher than the budgeted balance. This is primarily attributable to a reduction in employee leave taken during the 2021 reporting period due to the COVID-19 pandemic. D. Cash used to pay suppliers The ABC used $500,856,000 of cash to pay suppliers in the 2021 reporting period. This was $36,422,000 lower than the budgeted amount of $537,278,000 partly due to the timing of payments, as outlined under item B above, and partly due to differences in the mix of actual supplier and employee expenses paid during the 2021 reporting period compared to the budget. E. Cash used on payments for building improvements, plant and equipment and intangibles The ABC invested $78,215,000 of cash on payments for, building improvements, plant and equipment and intangibles in the 2021 reporting period. This was $8,588,000 lower than the budgeted amount of $86,803,000 due to timing variances in respect of capital project completion. Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2021 144 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 20212. Overview The Corporation is a Corporate Commonwealth, not-for-profit entity. Its functions are set out in section 6 of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 . Those functions are reflected in the statement of purpose in the ABC Corporate Plan 2020-21, which was prepared in accordance with section 35 of the PGPA Act. The Corporation's Portfolio Budget Statements set out one Outcome: inform, educate and entertain audiences throughout Australia and overseas through innovative and comprehensive media and related services. The continued existence of the Corporation in its present form and with its present programs is dependent on Government policy and on continued funding by Parliament. Accounting Framework The principal accounting policies adopted in preparing the financial statements of the Corporation are stated to assist in a general understanding of these financial statements. Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements The financial statements are general purpose financial statements as required by section 42 of the PGPA Act. The financial statements and notes have been prepared in accordance with the FRR and Australian Accounting Standards - Reduced Disclosure Requirements issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) that apply for the reporting period. The Corporation's financial statements have been prepared on an accrual basis and in accordance with the historical cost convention, except for certain assets and liabilities which are at fair value. Except where stated, no allowance is made for the effect of changing prices on the results or the financial position. The financial statements are presented in Australian dollars and values are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars unless otherwise specified. Significant Accounting Judgements The Corporation has taken the fair value of freehold land to be the market value of similar locations and the fair value of freehold buildings to be the depreciated replacement cost, as determined by an independent valuer. In addition, the Corporation has taken the fair value of plant and equipment to be the depreciated cost. Significant Accounting Estimates and Assumptions The Corporation has applied estimates and assumptions to the following significant items: Depreciation and amortisation, as detailed in Note 3C Depreciation and amortisation on ABC owned assets , and Note 7A ABC owned land, buildings, plant and equipment and intangibles ; Program amortisation, as detailed in Note 3E Program amortisation , and Note 7D Inventories ; Valuation of land, buildings, plant and equipment, as detailed in Note 7A ABC owned land, buildings, plant and equipment and intangibles ; Leased assets and lease liabilities, specifically identification of leased assets and lease liabilities where the ABC has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits, as detailed in Note 7B ABC right-of-use assets and Note 9B Lease Liability ; and Employee provisions, as detailed in Note 11 Employee Provisions . No other accounting assumptions or estimates have been identified that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. The impacts of COVID-19 have been factored into accounting assumptions and estimates where relevant. These impacts are immaterial. Financial Statements 145Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 20212.

Financial Statements 147Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 20213. Expenses (continued) Recognition and measurement Employee benefits Refer to Note 11 Employee Provisions . Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets The ABC has elected not to recognise right- of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases of assets that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets (less than $10,000). The ABC recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Depreciation on ABC owned assets Depreciable property, plant and equipment assets are depreciated to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Depreciation rates are initially based on asset useful lives, reviewed each year and adjusted as appropriate. Useful lives applying to each class of depreciable asset are referenced in Note 7A ABC owned land, buildings, plant and equipment and intangibles . These assets are assessed annually for potential impairment. Refer to Note 3I Write-down and impairment of other assets .Amortisation of ABC owned intangibles Intangibles comprise software for internal use. These assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Software assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over anticipated useful lives between 3-8 years (2020 3-8 years). These assets are assessed annually for potential impairment. Refer to Note 3I Write-down and impairment of other assets . 148 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2021Note 3D to 3I Notes2021 $'0002020 $'000 3D Depreciation on ABC right-of-use assets Land 7B 239 244 Buildings 7B 1,818 1,539 Plant and equipment 7B 61,146 61,447 Total Finance costsLoans from Department of Finance - 484 Other finance costs 56 74 Total finance costs 14B 56 558 3G Interest cost on lease liabilityBuildings 58 31 Plant and equipment 8,107 7,376 Total interest cost on lease liability 8,165 7,407 3H Impairment loss on financial instruments Trade and other receivables (166) 342 Total impairment loss on financial instruments (166) 342 3I Write-down and impairment of other assetsCommercial advances 1,564 1,019 Land and buildings 48 - Plant and equipment 79 115 Assets under construction 390 1,188 Inventory held for sale 16 25 Total write-down and impairment of other assets 2,097 2,347 Recognition and measurement Depreciation on ABC right-of-use assets The depreciation rates for right-of-use assets are calculated on a straight-line basis. The depreciable period extends from the commencement date of the lease to the end of the lease term or the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset if earlier. Amortisation of purchased programs Purchased program inventory is amortised in accordance with the policy for amortisation of produced programs. Subsequent sales of residual rights are recognised in the period in which they occur. Amortisation of produced programs The cost of produced television program inventory is amortised as follows: News, Current Affairs, Live Programs, Factual and Entertainment programs based on current topics \u2014 100% on first screening; Children's, Education and Movies \u2014 straight-line over three years from completion of production; ABC iview-only programs \u2014 100% on first release; and Programs not covered above \u2014 100% on first screening. Financial Statements 149Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 20213. Expenses (continued) In addition to the above, programs that are assessed as no longer having any service potential are 100% expensed at the time of the assessment. The costs of programs produced for Radio and ABC International are expensed as incurred. Such programs are normally broadcast soon after production, stock on hand at any time being minimal. The valuation of inventory is addressed in Note 7D Inventories . Finance costs All borrowing costs are expensed as incurred. Interest costs on the liability attributable to right-of-use assets Interest is calculated on the monthly outstanding balance of the lease liability (refer Note 9B Lease liability ). Assumptions surrounding uncertainty \u2014 interest costs on the liability attributable to right-of-use assets The valuation of the lease liability is influenced by the discount rate, as advised, on a quarterly basis, by the Commonwealth Department of Finance. The corresponding interest charged on the outstanding balance is a function of the incremental borrowing cost derived from the discount rate applicable at the commencement of the lease. The carrying balance of the lease liability is reviewed regularly and an assessment is made of the potential impact of a change in discount rates on this balance upon any lease modifications or reassessments.Impairment loss on financial instruments Under AASB 9 Financial Instruments, impairment of financial assets is provided for on the basis of future expected credit losses (ECLs) rather than as and when existing debts are deemed to be impaired. This allows for the expectation of credit losses to be adjusted in response to certain factors, for example prevailing or anticipated market conditions. Write-down and impairment of other assets Where indications of impairment exist, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated and an impairment adjustment is made if the asset's recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount. The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. Where the future economic benefit of an asset is not primarily dependent on the asset's ability to generate future cash flows, and the asset would be replaced if the Corporation were deprived of the asset, its value in use is taken to be its depreciated replacement cost. At 30 June 2021, the Corporation had performed assessments to determine the extent of any indications that assets may be impaired and the resultant financial impact has been incorporated in the table above. 150 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2021Financial Performance - Revenue and Income 4.

Own-Source Income (continued) The comparative sale of goods and rendering of services values in Note 4A Revenue from contracts with customers have been adjusted due to the reclassification of certain co-production revenue from sale of goods to rendering of services. Recognition and measurement Disaggregation of revenue from contracts with customers Royalties Royalty income arising from sales and usage- based royalties are recognised at the later of when the subsequent sales or usage occurs, or when the performance obligation has been satisfied. Therefore, royalty income is recognised at a 'point in time'. Content sales Licence fees from program content are recognised on the later of the start of the licence period (taking into account any holdback dates) or when the ABC's performance obligations have been satisfied. For content sales the performance obligation will generally be to deliver the associated program to the customer, therefore income is recognised 'episodically' - on delivery of each episode. Joint Operations Revenue attributable to joint operations represents the ABC's 50% share of MediaHub's revenue. This revenue comprises services fees recognised 'over time' as the services (predominantly for broadcast presentation) are provided.Grants and Services Contracts Revenue for grants and services contracts with specific performance obligations (primarily for international aid and development projects) is recognised 'over time' as services are provided, on an expense reimbursement or on a stage of completion basis. Pursuant to AASB 1058 Income of Not-for-Profit Entities , Grants from Government departments without specific performance obligations are recognised as income in the financial year that they relate to. Co-productions Co-production income is recognised on delivery of the related materials or on a stage of completion basis, depending on the nature of the contract with the customer. Other Contract Revenue Other contract revenue includes items such as commissions and distribution fees which are recognised at the later of when the subsequent sales or usage occurs. Interest Revenue Interest income is recognised as it accrues using the effective interest method and if not received at balance date, is reflected in the Statement of Financial Position as a receivable. 152 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2021Note 4C to 4F revenue 4,145 3,854 4D Net gain/(loss) from disposal of assets Land and buildingsTotal proceeds from disposal - 335 Carrying value of assets disposed (18) (335) Cost of disposal - (12) Net loss from disposal of land and buildings (18) (12) Infrastructure, plant and equipmentTotal proceeds from disposal 81 125 Carrying value of assets disposed (28) (15) Cost of disposal (23) (40) Net gain from disposal of infrastructure, plant and equipment 30 70 Total net/(loss) gain from disposal of assetsTotal proceeds from disposal 81 460 Total carrying value of assets disposed (46) (350) Total costs of disposal (23) (52) Total net gain from disposal of assets 12 58 4E Net foreign exchange gain Non-speculative 848 614 Total net foreign exchange gain 14B 848 614 4F Insurance recoveries Insurance recoveries (2,726) 5,796 Total insurance recoveries (2,726) 5,796 Financial Statements 153Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 20214. Own-Source Income (continued) Lease and other revenue Other revenue largely comprises revenue from lease or hire of ABC owned or controlled facilities. Rental income from the lease of ABC owned or controlled premises is recognised as lease income under AASB 16 Leases and disclosed separately to other revenue from customers disclosed under AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Gains or losses on disposal of assets Gains or losses from disposal of assets are recognised when control of the asset has passed to the buyer. Foreign currency transactions The Corporation enters into foreign currency hedging arrangements to protect its purchasing power in relation to foreign currency exposures. Revenues and expenditures denominated in foreign currencies are converted to Australian dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction or at the hedged rate. Gains and losses are taken to surplus/(deficit), except for except for transactions classified as cash flow hedges which are recognised in the hedging reserve within equity if material in value. Insurance recoveries Insurance recoveries include a reversal of recoveries raised in the 2020 reporting period. This amount represents the component of the insurance claim for the ABC Ultimo cladding project which was assessed as being no longer virtually certain of reimbursement as at 30 June 2021.Operating lease revenue commitments 2021 $'0002020 $'000 One year or less 1,855 1,841 From one to two years 1,600 1,620 From two to three years 1,303 1,493 From three to four years 1,169 1,192 From four to five years 984 902 Over five years 2,773 2,709 Total operating lease revenue commitments9,684 9,757 These commitments, largely relating to rental income for letting out office space, are GST exclusive. Lease terms are typically between 1 to 5 years in duration and income is subject to increases in accordance with CPI or other agreed increment. Operating lease revenue is earned via leasing of spare capacity within the ABC's properties and resources. The ABC leases out spare capacity only on assets it controls. There are no rights-related risks associated with the underlying assets that are being leased. 154 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2021Financial Position 5. Financial Position Recognition and measurement Acquisition of assets Assets are recorded at cost at the time of acquisition except as stated below. The cost of acquisition includes the fair value of assets transferred in exchange and liabilities undertaken. Assets acquired at no cost, or for nominal consideration, are initially recognised as assets at their fair value at the date of acquisition. Fair value measurement of assets and liabilities The Corporation has adopted the following general policies relating to the determination of fair value of assets and liabilities. AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level in accordance with the following fair value measurement hierarchy: Level 1 \u2014 quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 \u2014 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and Level 3 \u2014 unobservable inputs for an asset or liability. The fair value of land is determined by reference to the market value of the land component of ABC property because it is possible to base the fair value on recent sales of comparable sites. The Corporation's independent valuers detail these reference sites in valuation reports for respective properties. No observable market data is available for the ABC's buildings, given their highest and best use as specialised broadcasting facilities. The fair value of these assets is based on depreciated replacement cost (Level 3 inputs). Plant and equipment assets are measured based on depreciated cost (Level 3 inputs). Intangibles (software for internal use) are measured at cost less subsequent accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Generally, the fair value of the Corporation's other financial assets and liabilities is deemed to be their carrying value as it approximates fair value. The fair value of long-term loans is the net present value of future discounted cash flows arising. The Corporation holds a freehold property classified as held for sale, which was tendered for sale in an open market as disclosed in Note 7C Assets classified as held for sale . The sale process has been administered at arm's length by an independent agent. Apart from the asset held for sale, the Corporation does not hold any assets or liabilities measured at fair value that are valued using Level 1 inputs (i.e., with reference to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities). The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, financial assets and non-interest-bearing financial liabilities (except for derivatives used for hedging) of the Corporation, are measured at amortised cost, which approximates their fair value. There have been no recurring fair value measurements transferred between the respective levels for assets and liabilities for the year ended 30 June 2021. Financial Statements 155Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 20215. Financial Position (continued) Presentation in the financial statements The aforementioned is summarised in Note 5A Fair value measurement . Measurement of right-of-use assets and accompanying liability under AASB 16 Leases Leased right-of-use assets are capitalised at the commencement date of the lease and comprise the initial lease liability amount and initial direct costs incurred when entering into the lease, less any lease incentives received. On initial adoption of AASB 16 the Corporation adjusted the right-of-use assets at the date of initial application by the amount of any provision for onerous leases recognised immediately before the date of initial application. Following initial application, an impairment review is undertaken for any right-of-use asset that shows indicators of impairment and an impairment loss is recognised against any right-of-use asset that is impaired. Leased right-of-use assets continue to be measured at cost after initial recognition in Commonwealth agency, general government sector and whole of government financial statements. Assumptions surrounding uncertainty - Lease liability Refer to the commentary in Note 9B Lease liability under the same heading. 156 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 20215A.

Receivables are included in current assets, unless they mature more than 12 months after the Statement of Financial Position date, in which case they are classified as non-current assets. Financial Statements 159Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 20216. Financial Assets (continued) Note 6C to 6D Notes2021 $'0002020 $'000 6C Other investments Term deposits with an original maturity date greater than 90 days 212,600 222,400 Total other investments 14B 212,600 222,400 6D Accrued Goods and services 3,249 receivable 263 494 Total accrued revenue 14B 3,512 4,909 Other receivables At 30 June 2021, Other receivables includes forward exchange contracts at fair value through surplus/(deficit) of $62,000 (2020 nil). The balance represents estimated future cash flows, based on market forward exchange rates at 30 June 2021 and the forward contract rate, discounted by the observable yield curves of the respective currencies. The above amount reflects a nil average depreciation (2020 1.1%) of the Australian dollar against those currencies for which forward exchange contracts have been taken out, where the market forward rate at 30 June 2021 is lower than the contracted rate. Impairment of financial assets Financial assets are assessed for impairment throughout each reporting period as outlined below: Financial assets held at amortised cost If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred for financial assets held at amortised cost, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset's original effective interest rate. The loss is taken to the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Bad debts The Corporation assesses the likelihood of recovery of those debts, factoring in past bad debts experience. Bad debts are written off when identified. Impairment of receivables The ABC calculates an impairment loss allowance, based on historical rates of credit impairment, adjusted for any external factors likely to impact the rate of impairment. The carrying value of the impairment allowance loss is monitored against the value of debts likely to be considered at risk of being non-recoverable. At 30 June 2021 , the balance of the impairment loss allowance is $97,000 (2020 $383,000). For the year ended 30 June 2021, this amount was sufficient to cover outstanding debt attributable to customers at risk of non-recoverability. At June 2021, no specific debts attributable to customers were identified as at risk of non-recoverability (2020 $360,000). Other investments Under AASB 9 Financial Instruments , term deposits with an original maturity date greater than 90 days are recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method less impairment, with revenue recognised on an effective yield basis. Surplus cash is invested into short-term investments with maturities at acquisition date of greater than three months. These investments are due to be recovered within twelve months. 160 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 20217.

Financial Statements 161Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 20217. Non-Financial Assets (continued) Recognition and measurement Land, buildings, plant and equipment and intangibles The measurement basis for land, buildings, plant and equipment and intangibles is set out in Note 5A Fair value measurement . Asset recognition threshold Purchases of land, buildings, plant, equipment and intangibles are recognised initially at cost in the Statement of Financial Position. Purchases costing less than $2,000 are expensed in the year of acquisition except where they form part of a project or group of similar items, which are significant in total. Revaluation Following initial recognition at cost, ABC owned land, buildings and plant and equipment are measured at fair value (or an amount not materially different from fair value) less subsequent accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Valuations are conducted with sufficient frequency to ensure that the carrying amounts of assets do not materially vary from the assets' fair values as at the reporting date. The regularity of independent valuations depends upon the volatility of movements in market values for the relevant assets. Revaluation adjustments are made on a class basis. Any revaluation increment is credited to equity under the heading of revaluation reserve except to the extent that it reverses a previous revaluation decrement of the same asset class, previously recognised through surplus/(deficit). Revaluation decrements for a class of assets are recognised directly through surplus/(deficit) except to the extent that they reverse a previous revaluation increment for that class. Any accumulated depreciation at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the asset restated to the revalued amount.The ABC commissions an independent expert valuer to complete a comprehensive valuation of land and building assets every three years. This process was completed in the year ended 30 June 2020. The ABC's Ultimo property (the Corporation's highest value asset) was valued as of 30 June 2021 on a 'desktop' basis by the independent valuer. The valuation was materially aligned to the carrying amount of the asset and therefore no revaluation increment was recognised. Advice was also received that there were no material movements in Australian capital city commercial property markets during the year ended 30 June 2021. Based on this advice, it was determined that the carrying amount of the ABC's land and building assets aligns with their fair value. No further property valuations were commissioned, and no asset revaluations were recognised other than the revaluation of the ABC's Gordon Street land holding immediately prior to reclassification as an asset held for sale. Further details are disclosed in Note 7C Assets classified as held for sale . Impairment of non-current assets The aforementioned classes of assets have been and continue to be subjected to an assessment as to indicators of impairment under AASB 136 Impairment of Assets as at 30 June 2021. Impairment is assessed with consideration of the asset's remaining service value. Disposals An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no further future economic benefits are expected. 162 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 20217B ABC right-of-use assets Reconciliation of opening and closing balances of the ABC's right-of-use assets at 30 June 2021 is as follows: Land $'000Buildings $'000Plant and equipment $'000Total $'000 Carrying amount as at 30 June 2020 represented by Gross book value 22,679 6,043 690,105 718,827 Accumulated depreciation (244) (1,539) (61,447) (63,230) Closing net book value as at 2020 22,435 4,504 628,658 655,597 movements (a)1 765 582 1,348 Right-of-use assets attributable to joint operations Depreciation - - (3) (3) Net book value as at 30 June 2021 22,197 3,857 569,484 595,538 Carrying amount as byGross book value (483) (3,428) (122,597) (126,508) as at 30 June 2021 22,197 3,857 569,484 595,538 (a) Other movements include movements resulting from indexation and other pricing related adjustments, lease modifications and reclassifications. Recognition and measurement General principles Right-of-use assets are capitalised at the commencement date of the lease and comprise the initial lease liability amount and initial direct costs incurred when entering into the lease, less any lease incentives received. Following initial recognition, an impairment review is undertaken for any right-of-use asset that shows indicators of impairment and an impairment loss is recognised against any right-of-use asset that is impaired. Right-of-use assets continue to be measured at cost after initial recognition in Commonwealth agency, general government sector and Whole of Government financial statements. Land The ABC's right-of-use land is measured at cost, in accordance with the requirements of the PGPA (Financial Reporting) Rule 2015 .Buildings Right-of-use buildings largely consist of regional broadcasting offices and the ABC's overseas reporting bureaux. Plant and equipment Right-of-use plant and equipment comprises: a satellite transponder for digital television distribution; decoder boxes and dishes for satellite downlink services to support television transmission; transmission facility assets for digital terrestrial television transmission; transmission facility assets for terrestrial radio transmission; and vehicles. Depreciation The depreciation rates for right-of-use assets are based on the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term.

In June 2021 the ABC entered into a contract of sale for its property at 8 Gordon Street Elsternwick Victoria. The contract is due to be settled in December 2021. As required under AASB 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations , the ABC remeasured the value of the asset immediately before it was reclassified as held for sale (with the value based on the contracted sale price) and a revaluation decrement of $1,750,000 was recognised. The asset was subsequently impaired by $48,000 based on the costs to sell. Recognition and measurement Inventories (general) Inventories held for resale are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Inventories not held for resale are valued at the lower of cost, adjusted for any loss in service potential, identified and measured based on the existence of a current replacement cost that is lower than the original acquisition cost or other subsequent carrying amount. Produced programs Television programs are produced for domestic transmission and digital distribution. The cost of these programs includes co-production fees, direct salaries and expenses and production overheads allocated on a usage basis to the program. Production overheads not allocated to programs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. External contributions received in respect of co-production of television programs are offset against production costs which are recorded as Inventories in the Statement of Financial Position. The amortisation of inventories is addressed in Note 3E Program amortisation.Write-down of inventory held for distribution When inventories held for distribution are distributed, the carrying amount of those inventories is recognised as an expense. The amount of any write-down of inventories for loss of service potential, and all losses of inventories are recognised as an expense in the period the write-down or loss occurs. The amount of any reversal of any write-down of inventories arising from a reversal of the circumstances that gave rise to the loss of service potential will be recognised as a reduction in the value of inventories recognised as an expense in the period in which the reversal occurs. Write-down of retail inventory The amount of any write-down of inventories to net realisable value and all losses of inventory are recognised as an expense in the period the write-down or loss occurs. The amount of any reversal of any write-down of inventories arising from an increase in the net realisable value will be recognised as an inventory expense reduction in the period in which the reversal occurs. Impairment of prepayments No indicators of impairment were found for prepayments. Financial Statements 165Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 20218.

At 30 June 2021, MediaHub had drawn loans under seven (2020 six) facilities with the ANZ, with an aggregate balance of $5,423,000 (2020 $4,459,000). The ABC's share, as reflected in its Statement of Financial Position, is $2,711,000 (2020 $2,230,000). These facilities are generally repayable over five years. The facility is provided on an average variable interest rate to 30 June 2021 of 1.85% (2020 2%). Lease liability Note 9B Lease liability is the present value of future contractual payments, for the remaining life of the contracts. The present value of the lease liability is $579,173,000 (2020 $635,784,000). The life of the contracts includes extension options which the ABC is reasonably certain to exercise.The total cash outflow for leases for the year ended 30 June 2021 was $59,376,000 (2020 $60,365,000) The undiscounted value of future lease payments is $622,966,000 (2020 $680,838,000). The average discount rate, determined with reference to the Commonwealth Department of Finance incremental borrowing rates, issued quarterly, was approximately 1.10% (2020 1.11%). The incremental borrowing rate used for each lease approximated the start date for each lease. Assumptions surrounding uncertainty - Lease liability The valuation of the lease liability is influenced by the discount rate, as advised, on a quarterly basis, by the Commonwealth Department of Finance. The carrying balance of this item is reviewed regularly and an assessment is made of the potential impact of a change in discount rates on this balance upon any lease modifications or reassessments. For all new contracts entered into, the ABC considers whether the contract is, or contains a lease. A lease is defined as 'a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to use an asset (the underlying asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration'. Financial Statements 167Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2021Once it has been determined that a contract is, or contains a lease, the lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments unpaid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate is readily determinable, or the department's incremental borrowing rate. The corresponding asset value, as disclosed in Note 7B ABC right-of-use assets , is initially measured based on the value of the liability. Subsequent to initial measurement, the liability is reduced for payments made and increased for interest. It is remeasured to reflect any reassessment or modification to the lease. When the lease liability is remeasured, the corresponding adjustment is reflected in the right-of-use asset or profit and loss depending on the nature of the re-assessment or modifications. 168 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 202110.

The provision for make good represents the estimated make good cost for leased properties at the end of the lease term. The estimated cost is based on management's best estimate of the cost to make good each site, plus an allowance for inflation. During the year, the ABC provided nil further amounts (2020 nil) for remediation works to replace the external cladding on the Ultimo, NSW building, to ensure compliance with the current BCA Fire Safety Standards. For the year to 30 June 2021, expenditure incurred on this project was $3,431,000 (2020 $28,721,000), resulting in a balance in the provision of $461,000 (2020 $3,892,000).

Employee Provisions 2021 $'0002020 $'000 11 Employee provisions Annual 177,703 (a) The settlement of employee leave provisions is based on the individual employee's entitlement to leave. Where an employee has a current entitlement to leave (i.e. is presently entitled to take the leave) or will have a present entitlement within 12 months, the value of that entitlement is included in the employee provisions expected to settle in no more than 12 months. Where the Corporation expects that an employee will be entitled to leave in the future but will not yet be entitled to that leave in 12 months, the value of the leave is included in the employee provision expected to settle in more than 12 months. (b) A provision is made for estimated historical salary and wages, and superannuation entitlements owed to certain employees. This estimate is based on an extrapolation of entitlements calculated for a portion of potentially affected employees and factors in risks and uncertainties associated with the settlement of the liability. Recognition and measurement Liabilities for short-term employee benefits and termination benefits expected within twelve months of the end of reporting period are measured at their nominal amounts. Other long-term employee benefits are measured as the net total of the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period minus the fair value at the end of the reporting period of plan assets (if any) out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. Leave Leave liabilities are the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made by the Corporation in respect of leave resulting from employees' service, provided up to 30 June 2021. Leave liabilities are calculated based on employees' remuneration at the estimated salary rates that will apply at the time the leave is taken, including the employer superannuation contribution rates to the extent that the leave is likely to be taken during service rather than paid out on termination. The calculation is based on the anticipated length of time taken for an employee to fully settle their leave entitlement. The long service leave liability is calculated by an actuary.This amount is determined by reference to attrition rates and pay increases through promotion and inflation. A discount rate of 1.0% was applied to calculate the present value of the liability (2020 0.6%). This discount rate is based on the Commonwealth Government bond yield for a bond with a similar term to the liability. Redundancy A provision is made for separation and redundancy benefit payments. The ABC recognises a provision for termination when it has developed a detailed formal plan that will result in the terminations and has informed those employees affected that it will carry out the plan. Superannuation ABC employees are members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS), Public Sector Superannuation Scheme (PSS), the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan Scheme (PSSap) or another non-Commonwealth superannuation fund. The CSS and PSS are defined benefit schemes for the Australian Government. The PSSap and other non-Commonwealth funds are defined contribution schemes. 170 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2021The liability for defined benefits is recognised in the financial statements of the Australian Government and is settled by the Australian Government in due course. This liability is reported in the Department of Finance's administered schedules and notes. The Corporation makes employer contributions to the employee defined benefit superannuation schemes at rates determined by an actuary to be sufficient to meet the current cost to the Government of the superannuation entitlements of the Corporation's employees. The Corporation accounts for the contributions in the same manner as contributions to defined contribution plans. The liability for superannuation recognised at 30 June 2021 represents outstanding historical contributions at the end of the period. Expenses Expenses attributable to the aforementioned employee benefits and provisions are reported in Note 3A Employee benefits . Assumptions surrounding uncertainty - Measurement of leave liabilities The discount rates used in valuing leave liabilities are based on Australian government bond rates with maturities that closely align with the length of the liability. The ABC regularly reviews leave liabilities and the impact of any adjustment to bond rates on these balances. Leave liabilities are also impacted by assumptions surrounding future salary inflation. The ABC regularly monitors factors that are likely to impact future salary inflation. Financial Statements 171Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 202112.

Financial Statements 177Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 202114. Financial Instruments (continued) Recognition and measurement Financial Instruments Financial Assets The Corporation classifies its financial assets in the following categories: financial assets measured at amortised cost; and financial assets at fair value through surplus/(deficit) .The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. Financial assets are recognised and derecognised upon trade date. The comparative carrying values of financial instruments have been adjusted in the above table due to a reclassification of certain items. The carrying value of financial instruments specifically excludes the following line items, illustrated in the reconciliation below. These items do not fall under the definition of financial instruments: Reconciliation of financial instruments Notes2021 $'0002020 $'000 Total financial assets stated in the Statement of Financial Position adjusted for:234,879 264,732 - Net GST receivable from the Australian Taxation Office 6B (4,648) (5,039) Total financial assets classified as financial instruments 230,231 259,693 Total payables and interest bearing liabilities stated in the Statement of Financial Position adjusted for:728,816 779,434 - Lease liability 9B (579,173) (635,784) - wages (including separation and redundancies) 8B (19,319) (23,832) - Trade creditor amounts payable to the ATO 8A (5,359) - - Superannuation 8B (602) (554) - Unearned revenue 8B (22,093) (23,006) financial liabilities classified as financial instruments 102,270 96,258 14B Categories of Financial Instruments (continued) Recognition and measurement (continued) Financial Assets (continued) Effective Interest Method Income is recognised on an effective interest rate basis except for financial assets that are recognised at fair value through surplus/(deficit). The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest income over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.Financial Assets at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) or surplus/(deficit) Financial assets are classified as financial assets at fair value through surplus/(deficit) where the financial assets: have been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near future; are derivatives (except for derivative instruments that are designated as, and are highly effective hedging instruments); or are parts of an identified portfolio of financial instruments that the Corporation manages together and have a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking. Forward exchange contracts in this category are classified as current assets. 178 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2021Financial assets at fair value through surplus/ (deficit) are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in surplus/(deficit). The net gain or loss recognised in surplus/(deficit) incorporates any interest earned on the financial asset. The Corporation's financial assets in this category are forward exchange contracts which are derivative financial instruments. Gains and losses on these items are recognised through surplus/(deficit) except if they are classified as a cash flow hedge where they are recognised in the hedging reserve within equity if material in value.

These liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective interest basis. Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the contracts are entered into and are subsequently revalued to reflect changes in fair value. Forward exchange contracts are carried as assets when their net fair value is positive and as liabilities when their net fair value is negative. For the purpose of hedge accounting, the Corporation's hedges are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable either to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset, liability or to a highly probable forecast transaction. At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Corporation formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Corporation wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the Corporation will assess the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item's fair value or cash flow attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated. Financial Statements 179Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 202114. Financial Instruments (continued) The effective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow hedge, where material, is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is recognised in surplus/(deficit). Immaterial gains and losses on cash flow hedges are recognised in surplus/(deficit). Amounts taken to equity are transferred to surplus/(deficit) when the hedged transaction affects the surplus/(deficit), such as when hedged income or expenses are recognised or when a forecast sale or purchase occurs. When the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to surplus/(deficit). If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain until the forecast transaction occurs. If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to surplus/(deficit). 14C Financial Risk Management The Corporation's financial risk management policies and procedures are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Corporation, to set appropriate risk limits and controls to monitor risks and adherence to limits. The Corporation's policies are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in the Corporation's activities. There has been no change in the policies from the previous year. Compliance with policies and exposure limits are reviewed by the Corporation's internal auditors on a regular basis. To meet the Corporation's regular financial risk management objectives, surplus cash is invested in short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities at acquisition date of greater than three months. These investments are included as other receivables .The Corporation's Treasury function provides advice and services to the business, coordinates access to foreign currency contracts and monitors and assesses the financial risks relating to the operations of the Corporation through internal risk reports. Where appropriate, the Corporation seeks to minimise the effects of its financial risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge risk exposures. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Corporation's policies, approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and investment of funds. The Corporation does not enter into or trade financial instruments for speculative purposes. Under Section 25B of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 , the Corporation's Foreign Exchange Policy is conducted to reduce or eliminate risk on the Corporation's known exposures and activities and will be recorded under accepted accounting standards. The Corporation's aims, by entering into foreign currency hedging arrangements, are outlined in Note 4 Own Source Income under the heading Foreign currency transactions . 14D Fair Values of Financial Instruments Forward exchange contracts The fair value of forward exchange contracts is taken to be the unrealised gain or loss at balance date calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. At 30 June 2021 this was a net receivable of $62,000 (2020 payable of $144,000). The fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (such as over-the-counter derivatives) are determined using Level 2 inputs based on the forward exchange rates at the end of the reporting period using assumptions that are reflective of market conditions at the end of each reporting period. 180 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2021Loans The fair values of any long-term borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, based on current interest rates for liabilities with similar risk profiles. 14E Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Corporation. Credit risk arises from the financial assets of the Corporation, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, short term investments and derivative instruments. The Corporation has a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining collateral where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The Corporation assesses credit ratings through independent ratings agencies and if not available, uses publicly available financial information and its own trading record to rate customers. The Corporation manages its credit risk by undertaking credit checks on customers who wish to take on credit terms. The Corporation has policies that set limits for each individual customer. Ongoing credit evaluations are performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable. The Corporation has no material concentration of credit risk with any single customer as the Corporation has a large number of customers spread across a range of industries and geographical areas. The credit risk arising from dealings in financial instruments is controlled by a strict policy of credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors. The Corporation does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty. The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with credit ratings of at least A as assigned by Standard & Poor's.The Corporation's maximum exposure to credit risk at reporting date in relation to each class of recognised financial assets is the carrying amount, net of the expected credit loss provision, of those assets as indicated in the Statement of Financial Position. Credit exposure of foreign currency and interest rate bearing investments is represented by the net fair value of the contracts. 14F Hedging Instruments The following table sets out the gross value to be received under forward exchange contracts, the weighted average contracted exchange rates and the settlement periods of outstanding contracts for the Corporation. General hedges The Corporation enters into forward exchange contracts to cover foreign currency payments for exposures less than $50,000, of a recurrent nature and with varying foreign currency amounts and payment dates. General cover is typically held between 20% and 80% of estimated exposures for USD, GBP and EUR subject to market conditions. At balance date, the Corporation held forward exchange contracts to buy USD, GBP and EUR. Gains/losses arising from general hedges outstanding at year end have been taken to surplus/(deficit). The net gain is $40,000 (2020 net loss of $149,000) on general hedges of anticipated foreign currency purchases, outstanding at 30 June 2021.

They may arise from uncertainty as to the existence of an asset or liability or represent an asset or liability in respect of which the amount cannot be reliably measured. Contingent assets are disclosed when settlement is probable but not virtually certain and contingent liabilities are disclosed when the likelihood of settlement is greater than remote. Contingencies are disclosed on a net basis.Quantifiable and significant remote contingencies The Corporation has neither material contingent assets nor remote contingent liabilities at 30 June 2021 (2020 nil). Unquantifiable contingencies In the normal course of activities, claims for damages and other recoveries have been lodged at the date of this report against the Corporation and its staff. The Corporation has disclaimed liability and is actively defending these actions. It is not possible to estimate the amounts of any eventual payments which may be required or amounts that may be received in relation to any of these claims. Commitments Lease revenue and capital purchases commitments are disclosed in Note 4 Own-Source Income and Note 7 Non-Financial Assets respectively. 182 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2021Australia Talks co-host Annabel Crabb.

Regulatory Framework The ABC Board is required, under paragraph 8(1) (e) of the ABC Act, to develop a code of practice relating to its television and radio programming, and to notify this code to the Australian Communications and Media Authority ('the ACMA'). A complaint alleging the ABC has acted contrary to its Code of Practice in its television or radio programming may be made to the ABC. A complainant is entitled under section 150 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth) ('the BSA') to take their complaint to the ACMA if, after 60 days, the ABC fails to respond to the complainant or the complainant considers the ABC's response is inadequate. The ACMA has a discretionary power to investigate a complaint alleging the ABC has, in providing a national broadcasting service, breached its Code of Practice. Section 151 of the BSA provides that the ACMA may investigate the complaint if it thinks that it is desirable to do so. The ACMA's jurisdiction under sections 150151 does not encompass the ABC's print content or content disseminated by the ABC over the internet or through mobile devices. However, the eSafety Commissioner has separate jurisdiction under Schedule 7 to the BSA in relation to content hosted on websites or transmitted through mobile services where that content is either 'prohibited content' 1 or 'agerestricted content'.2 The eSafety Commissioner is empowered under Schedule 7 to require content service providers and content hosts to remove or prevent access to these types of content. The ABC voluntarily complies with the Content Services Code, which is registered as an industry code with the eSafety Commissioner under clause 85 of Schedule 7 to the BSA.The Content Services Code does not apply to content delivered through online or mobile services where that content has been previously transmitted on radio or television. Except as expressly provided by the BSA, the regulatory regime established by the BSA does not apply to the ABC: subsection 13(5) of the BSA, and section 79 of the ABC Act. II. Scope of the Code The requirements of this Code are set out in the sections dealing with Interpretation and Standards in Part IV and the Associated Standard in Part V. The Standards in Part IV apply to radio and television programs broadcast by the ABC on its freetoair television or radio broadcasting services. The Associated Standard in Part V applies only to television programs broadcast by the ABC on its domestic freetoair television services. Complaints about content on the services named above fall within the scope of the Code except where: the complaint concerns content which is or becomes the subject of legal proceedings; the complaint was frivolous or vexatious or not made in good faith; the complainant does not have a sufficient interest in the subject matter of the complaint, where the complaint alleges a breach of Fair and honest dealing (Standards 5.15.8) or Privacy (Standard 6.1). 1 Prohibited content essentially involves content that is classified either as RC (Refused Classification) or X18+. This includes real depictions of actual sexual activity, child pornography, detailed instruction in crime, and violence or drug use. 2 Agerestricted content involves content classified as R18+ or MA15+ that is delivered through a mobile device or through a service that provides audio or video content for a fee. This type of content must be subject to a restricted access system, i.e. measures put in place to protect children under the age of 15 from exposure to unsuitable material. This category of content includes material containing strong depictions of nudity, implied sexual activity, drug use or violence, very frequent or very strong coarse language, and other material that is strong in impact. Appendices 191 the complaint was lodged with the ABC more than six weeks after the date when the program was last broadcast by the ABC on its freetoair radio or television services, unless the complaint is accepted for investigation on the grounds that is appropriate to do so, having regard to: -the interests of the complainant in the subject matter of the complaint; -the seriousness of the alleged breach; -the reason(s) for the delay; -the availability of the program content which is the subject of the complaint; and -any prejudice the delay may otherwise have on the ability to investigate and determine the matter fairly. III. Resolved Complaints The ABC seeks to comply fully with the Code and to resolve complaints as soon as practicable. A failure to comply will not be a breach of the Code if the ABC has, prior to the complaint being made to the ACMA, taken steps which were adequate and appropriate in all the circumstances to redress the cause of the complaint. To illustrate, a failure to comply with Standards 2.1 or 2.2 (Accuracy) will not be taken to be a breach of the Code if a correction or clarification, which is adequate and appropriate in all the circumstances, is made prior to or within 30 days of the ABC receiving the complaint. IV. Principles and Standards Preamble The ABC belongs to the Australian people. Earning and retaining their trust is essential to fulfilling the ABC's charter and its responsibilities under the ABC Act to provide innovative and comprehensive services of a high standard to Australian and international audiences. The principles and standards set out below are the means by which the ABC seeks to meet these obligations.They uphold the fundamental journalistic principles of accuracy and impartiality, to protect the ABC's independence and integrity. They recognise that ABC content must be created in a way that is respectful towards audiences and mindful of community standards in areas like harm and offence. At the same time, they recognise that the ABC needs to be adventurous, brave and creative: Adventurous in encouraging new and sometimes confronting forms of art and entertainment. Brave in reporting without fear or favour, even when that might be uncomfortable or unpopular; and Creative in finding new ways of telling Australian stories, reflecting Australian culture and sharing in the Australian conversation. By holding to these principles and standards, the ABC seeks to be accountable to the Australian people who fund us. 1. Interpretation In this Code, the Standards must be interpreted and applied in accordance with the Principles applying in each Section. From time to time, the ABC publishes Guidance Notes which do not in themselves impose obligations on the ABC, but which may be relevant in interpreting and applying the Code. The Standards in Parts IV and V are to be interpreted and applied with due regard for the nature of the content under consideration in particular cases. The ABC is conscious that its dual obligations - for accountability and for high quality - can in practice interact in complex ways. It can be a sign of strength not weakness that journalism enrages or art shocks. The Standards are to be applied in ways that maintain independence and integrity, preserve trust and do not unduly constrain journalistic enquiry or artistic expression. 192 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 20212. Accuracy Principles: The ABC has a statutory duty to ensure that the gathering and presentation of news and information is accurate according to the recognised standards of objective journalism. Credibility depends heavily on factual accuracy. Types of factbased content include news and analysis of current events, documentaries, factual dramas and lifestyle programs. The ABC requires that reasonable efforts must be made to ensure accuracy in all factbased content. The ABC gauges those efforts by reference to: the type, subject and nature of the content; the likely audience expectations of the content; the likely impact of reliance by the audience on the accuracy of the content; and the circumstances in which the content was made and presented. The ABC accuracy standard applies to assertions of fact, not to expressions of opinion. An opinion, being a value judgement or conclusion, cannot be found to be accurate or inaccurate in the way facts can. The accuracy standard requires that opinions be conveyed accurately, in the sense that quotes should be accurate and any editing should not distort the meaning of the opinion expressed. The efforts reasonably required to ensure accuracy will depend on the circumstances. Sources with relevant expertise may be relied on more heavily than those without. Eyewitness testimony usually carries more weight than secondhand accounts. The passage of time or the inaccessibility of locations or sources can affect the standard of verification reasonably required. The ABC should make reasonable efforts, appropriate in the context, to signal to audiences gradations in accuracy, for example by querying interviewees, qualifying bald assertions, supplementing the partly right and correcting the plainly wrong.Standards: 2.1 Make reasonable efforts to ensure that material facts are accurate and presented in context. 2.2 Do not present factual content in a way that will materially mislead the audience. In some cases, this may require appropriate labels or other explanatory information. 3. Corrections and clarifications Principles: A commitment to accuracy includes a willingness to correct errors and clarify ambiguous or otherwise misleading information. Swift correction can reduce harmful reliance on inaccurate information, especially given content can be quickly, widely and permanently disseminated. Corrections and clarifications can contribute to achieving fairness and impartiality. Standards: 3.1 Acknowledge and correct or clarify, in an appropriate manner as soon as reasonably practicable: a. significant material errors that are readily apparent or have been demonstrated; or b. information that is likely to significantly and materially mislead. 4. Impartiality and diversity of perspectives Principles: The ABC has a statutory duty to ensure that the gathering and presentation of news and information is impartial according to the recognised standards of objective journalism. Aiming to equip audiences to make up their own minds is consistent with the public service character of the ABC. A democratic society depends on diverse sources of reliable information and contending opinions. A broadcaster operating under statute with public funds is legitimately expected to contribute in ways that may differ from commercial media, which are free to be partial to private interests. Appendices 193Judgements about whether impartiality was achieved in any given circumstances can vary among individuals according to their personal and subjective view of any given matter of contention. Acknowledging this fact of life does not change the ABC's obligation to apply its impartiality standard as objectively as possible. In doing so, the ABC is guided by these hallmarks of impartiality: a balance that follows the weight of evidence; fair treatment; openmindedness; and opportunities over time for principal relevant perspectives on matters of contention to be expressed. The ABC aims to present, over time, content that addresses a broad range of subjects from a diversity of perspectives reflecting a diversity of experiences, presented in a diversity of ways from a diversity of sources, including content created by ABC staff, generated by audiences and commissioned or acquired from external contentmakers. Impartiality does not require that every perspective receives equal time, nor that every facet of every argument is presented. Assessing the impartiality due in given circumstances requires consideration in context of all relevant factors including: the type, subject and nature of the content; the circumstances in which the content is made and presented; the likely audience expectations of the content; the degree to which the matter to which the content relates is contentious; the range of principal relevant perspectives on the matter of contention; and the timeframe within which it would be appropriate for the ABC to provide opportunities for the principal relevant perspectives to be expressed, having regard to the public importance of the matter of contention and the extent to which it is the subject of current debate.Standards: 4.1 Gather and present news and information with due impartiality. 4.2 Present a diversity of perspectives so that, over time, no significant strand of thought or belief within the community is knowingly excluded or disproportionately represented. 4.3 Do not state or imply that any perspective is the editorial opinion of the ABC. The ABC takes no editorial stance other than its commitment to fundamental democratic principles including the rule of law, freedom of speech and religion, parliamentary democracy and equality of opportunity. 4.4 Do not misrepresent any perspective. 4.5 Do not unduly favour one perspective over another. 5. Fair and honest dealing Principles: Fair and honest dealing is essential to maintaining trust with audiences and with those who participate in or are otherwise directly affected by ABC content. In rare circumstances, deception or a breach of an undertaking may be justified. Because of the potential damage to trust, deception or breach of an undertaking must be explained openly afterwards unless there are compelling reasons not to do so. Standards: Dealing with participants 5.1 Participants in ABC content should normally be informed of the general nature of their participation. 5.2 A refusal to participate will not be overridden without good cause. Opportunity to respond 5.3 Where allegations are made about a person or organisation, make reasonable efforts in the circumstances to provide a fair opportunity to respond. 194 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2021Attribution and sources 5.4 Aim to attribute information to its source. 5.5 Where a source seeks anonymity, do not agree without first considering the source's motive and any alternative attributable sources. 5.6 Do not misrepresent another's work as your own. Undertakings 5.7 Assurances given in relation to conditions of participation, use of content, confidentiality or anonymity must be honoured except in rare cases where justified in the public interest. Secret recording and other types of deception 5.8 Secret recording, misrepresentation or other types of deception must not be used by the ABC or its coproduction partners to obtain or seek information, audio, pictures or an agreement to participate except where: (a ) justified in the public interest and the material cannot reasonably be obtained by any other means; or (b ) consent is obtained from the subject or identities are effectively obscured; or (c ) the deception is integral to an artistic work. In all cases, the potential for harm must be taken into consideration. 6. Privacy Principles: Privacy is necessary to human dignity and every person reasonably expects that their privacy will be respected. But privacy is not absolute. The ABC seeks to balance the public interest in respect for privacy with the public interest in disclosure of information and freedom of expression. Standards: 6.1 Intrusion into a person's private life without consent must be justified in the public interest and the extent of the intrusion must be limited to what is proportionate in the circumstances.7. Harm and offence Principles: The ABC broadcasts comprehensive and innovative content that aims to inform, entertain and educate diverse audiences. This involves a willingness to take risks, invent and experiment with new ideas. It can result in challenging content which may offend some of the audience some of the time. But it also contributes to diversity of content in the media and to fulfilling the ABC's function to encourage and promote the musical, dramatic and other performing arts. The ABC acknowledges that a public broadcaster should never gratuitously harm or offend and accordingly any content which is likely to harm or offend must have a clear editorial purpose. The ABC potentially reaches the whole community, so it must take into account community standards. However, the community recognises that what is and is not acceptable in ABC content largely depends upon the particular context, including the nature of the content, its target audience, and any signposting that equips audiences to make informed choices about what they see, hear or read. Applying the harm and offence standard, therefore, requires careful judgement. What may be inappropriate and unacceptable in one context may be appropriate and acceptable in another. Coarse language, disturbing images or unconventional situations may form a legitimate part of reportage, debate, documentaries or a humorous, satirical, dramatic or other artistic work. Standards: 7.1 Content that is likely to cause harm or offence must be justified by the editorial context. 7.2 Where content is likely to cause harm or offence, having regard to the context, make reasonable efforts to provide information about the nature of the content through the use of classification labels or other warnings or advice. Appendices 1957.3 Ensure all domestic television programs - with the exception of news, current affairs and sporting events - are classified and scheduled for broadcast in accordance with the ABC's Associated Standard on Television Program Classification. 7.4 If inadvertent or unexpected actions, audio or images in live content are likely to cause harm or offence, take appropriate steps to mitigate. 7.5 The reporting or depiction of violence, tragedy or trauma must be handled with extreme sensitivity. Avoid causing undue distress to victims, witnesses or bereaved relatives. Be sensitive to significant cultural practices when depicting or reporting on recently deceased persons. 7.6 Where there is editorial justification for content which may lead to dangerous imitation or exacerbate serious threats to individual or public health, safety or welfare, take appropriate steps to mitigate those risks, particularly by taking care with how content is expressed or presented. 7.7 Avoid the unjustified use of stereotypes or discriminatory content that could reasonably be interpreted as condoning or encouraging prejudice. 8. Children and young people Principles: The ABC aims to provide children and young people (under the age of 18) with enjoyable and enriching content, as well as opportunities for them to express themselves. Children and young people participate and interact with the ABC in various ways - as actors, presenters, interviewees, subjects, content makers and audience members. The ABC has a responsibility to protect children and young people from potential harm that might arise during their engagement with the ABC and its content. The ABC shares this responsibility with parents/guardians and with the child or young person him/herself.In particular, the ABC recommends that parents/guardians supervise children and young people's access to content, their participation in interactive services, and their exposure to news and current affairs. It is not always possible to avoid presenting content that may be distressing to some audience members. Standards: 8.1 Take due care over the dignity and physical and emotional welfare of children and young people who are involved in making, participating in and presenting content produced or commissioned by the ABC. 8.2 Before significant participation of a child or young person in content produced or commissioned by the ABC, or in interactive services offered by the ABC, consider whether it is appropriate to obtain the consent of both the child/young person and the parent/guardian. 8.3 Adopt appropriate measures wherever practicable to enable children and young people, or those who supervise them, to manage risks associated with the child/young person's participation with, use of and exposure to ABC content and services designed for them. 8.4 Take particular care to minimise risks of exposure to unsuitable content or inappropriate contact by peers or strangers. V. Associated Standard: Television Program Classification Status of Associated Standard This Associated Standard is approved by the ABC Board and is binding. It is for consideration by relevant editorial decisionmakers when providing advice on compliance and by complaints bodies when dealing with complaints. The Associated Standard is provided to assist interpretation of or otherwise supplement the standard in the Editorial Policies to which the Associated Standard relates. 196 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2021This Associated Standard forms part of the Code of Practice notified to the Australian Communications and Media Authority under section 8(1)(e) of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 . Key Editorial Standard 7.3 Ensure all domestic television programs - with the exception of news, current affairs and sporting events - are classified and scheduled for broadcast in accordance with the ABC's Associated Standard on Television Program Classification. Principles: The ABC applies the classifications listed below to the broadcast of all its domestic television programs with the exception of news, current affairs and sporting events. The ABC classifications are adapted from the Guidelines for the Classification of Films and Computer Games issued by the Classification Board made under the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995. The guiding principle in the application of the following classifications is context. What is inappropriate and unacceptable in one context may be appropriate and acceptable in another. Factors to be taken into account include: the artistic or educational merit of the production, the purpose of a sequence, the tone, the camera work, the intensity and relevance of the material, the treatment, and the intended audience. Standards: 7.3.1 Television Classifications G - GENERAL G programs may be shown at any time. G programs, which include programs designed for preschool and schoolaged children, are suitable for children to watch on their own. Some G programs may be more appropriate for older children.The G classification does not necessarily indicate that the program is one that children will enjoy. Some G programs contain themes or storylines that are not of interest to children. Whether or not the program is intended for children, the treatment of themes and other classifiable elements will be careful and discreet. Themes: The treatment of themes should be discreet, justified by context, and very mild in impact. The presentation of dangerous, imitable behaviour is not permitted except in those circumstances where it is justified by context. Any depiction of such behaviour must not encourage dangerous imitation. Violence: Violence may be very discreetly implied, but should: have a light tone, or have a very low sense of threat or menace, and be infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Sex: Sexual activity should: only be suggested in very discreet visual or verbal references, and be infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Artistic or cultural depictions of nudity in a sexual context may be permitted if the treatment is discreet, justified by context, and very mild in impact. Language: Coarse language should: be very mild and infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Drug Use: The depiction of the use of legal drugs should be handled with care. Illegal drug use should be implied only very discreetly and be justified by context. Appendices 197Nudity: Nudity outside of a sexual context should be: infrequent, and not detailed, and not gratuitous. PG - PARENTAL GUIDANCE (Parental Guidance recommended for people under 15 years) Subject to the Implementation Guidelines at 7.3.2, PG programs may be shown in accordance with Time Zone Charts at 7.3.5. PG programs may contain themes and concepts which, when viewed by those under 15 years, may require the guidance of an adult. The PG classification signals to parents that material in this category contains depictions or references which could be confusing or upsetting to children without adult guidance. Material classified PG will not be harmful or disturbing to children. Parents may choose to preview the material for their children. Some may choose to watch the material with their children. Others might find it sufficient to be accessible during or after the viewing to discuss the content. Themes: The treatment of themes should be discreet and mild in impact. More disturbing themes are not generally dealt with at PG level. Supernatural or mild horror themes may be included. Violence: Violence may be discreetly implied or stylised and should also be: mild in impact, and not shown in detail. Sex: Sexual activity and nudity in a sexual context may be suggested, but should: be discreet, and be infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Verbal references to sexual activity should be discreet. Language: Coarse language should be mild and infrequent.Drug Use: Discreet verbal references and mild, incidental visuals of drug use may be included, but these should not promote or encourage drug use. Nudity: Nudity outside of a sexual context should not be detailed or gratuitous.M - MATURE (Recommended for people aged 15 years and over) Subject to the Implementation Guidelines at 7.3.2, M programs may be shown in accordance with the Time Zone Charts at 7.3.5. The M category is recommended for people aged over 15 years. Programs classified M contain material that is considered to be potentially harmful or disturbing to those under 15 years. Depictions and references to classifiable elements may contain detail. While most themes may be dealt with, the degree of explicitness and intensity of treatment will determine what can be accommodated in the M category - the less explicit or less intense material will be included in the M classification and the more explicit or more intense material, especially violent material, will be included in the MA15+ classification. Themes: Most themes can be dealt with, but the treatment should be discreet and the impact should not be strong. Violence: Generally, depictions of violence should: not contain a lot of detail, and not be prolonged. In realistic treatments, depictions of violence that contain detail should: be infrequent, and not have a strong impact, and not be gratuitous. 198 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2021In stylised treatments, depictions of violence may contain more detail and be more frequent if this does not increase the impact. Verbal and visual references to sexual violence may only be included if they are: discreet and infrequent, and strongly justified by the narrative or documentary context. Sex: Sexual activity may be discreetly implied. Nudity in a sexual context should not contain a lot of detail or be prolonged. Verbal references to sexual activity may be more detailed than depictions if this does not increase the impact. Language: Coarse language may be used. Generally, coarse language that is stronger, detailed or very aggressive should: be infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Drug Use: Drug use may be discreetly shown. Drug use should not be promoted or encouraged. Nudity: Nudity outside of a sexual context may be shown but depictions that contain any detail should not be gratuitous. MA15+ - MATURE AUDIENCE (Not suitable for people under 15 years) Subject to the Implementation Guidelines at 7.3.2, MA15+ programs may be shown in accordance with the Time Zone Charts at 7.3.5. MA15+ programs, because of the matter they contain or because of the way it is treated, are not suitable for people aged under 15 years. Material classified MA15+ deals with issues or contains depictions which require a more mature perspective. This is because the impact of individual elements or a combination of elements is considered likely to be harmful or disturbing to viewers under 15 years of age. While most themes may be dealt with, the degree of explicitness and intensity of treatment will determine what can be accommodated in the MA15+ category - the more explicit or more intense material, especially violent material, will be included in the MA15+ classification and the less explicit or less intense material will be included in the M classification. Themes: The treatment of themes with a high degree of intensity should not be gratuitous.Violence: Generally, depictions of violence should not have a high impact.In realistic treatments, detailed depictions of violence with a strong impact should: be infrequent, and not be prolonged, and not be gratuitous. Depictions of violence in stylised treatments may be more detailed and more frequent if this does not increase the impact. Depictions of sexual violence are permitted only if they are not frequent, prolonged, gratuitous or exploitative. Sex: Sexual activity may be implied. Depictions of nudity in a sexual context which contain detail should not be exploitative. Verbal references may be more detailed than depictions if this does not increase the impact. Language: Coarse language may be used. Coarse language that is very strong, aggressive or detailed should not be gratuitous. Drug Use: Drug use may be shown but should not be promoted or encouraged.More detailed depictions should not have a high degree of impact. Nudity: Nudity should be justified by context. 7.3.2 Implementation Guidelines The time zones for each program classification are guides to the most likely placement of programs within that classification. They are not hard and fast rules and there will be occasions on which programs or segments of programs appear in other time zones. Appendices 199There must be sound reasons for any departure from the time zone for a program classification. Possible reasons might include, for example, the need to schedule programs which are serious presentations of moral, social or cultural issues, in timeslots most suitable for their target audiences. Programs, including those having a particular classification under the Classification Board's Guidelines for the Classification of Films and Computer Games, may be modified so that they are suitable for broadcast or suitable for broadcast at particular times. Broken Hill in New South Wales shares a time zone with South Australia but ordinarily receives the ABC's New South Wales TV services. Given the time zone difference, some programs are broadcast outside their classification time zone. 7.3.3 Television Classification Symbols The classification symbol of the PG, M or MA15+ program (except for news, current affairs or sporting events) being shown will be displayed at the beginning of the program. The classification symbol of the PG, M or MA15+ program (except for news, current affairs or sporting events) being promoted will be displayed during the promotion. 7.3.4 Consumer Advice Audio and visual consumer advice on the reasons for an M or MA15+ classification will be given prior to the beginning of an M or MA15+ program. 7.3.5 Classification of Live Content Many live programs fall into the classification exemption categories (news, current affairs and sporting events). Some, such as live music or comedy programs, do not fall into the exemption categories and pose a particular challenge to classify accurately. The ABC makes reasonable efforts to classify these programs accurately by reviewing scripts, lyrics, outlines, and any prerecorded material, and briefing program makers and talent as required.A failure to provide an accurate classification symbol or consumer advice prior to a live (or aslive) program will not be regarded as a breach of standards as long as reasonable efforts were made to classify it and appropriate steps are taken to mitigate any harm or offence.

Appendices 203Appendix 6 - Executive remuneration reporting As a Commonwealth entity, the ABC is required to disclose executive remuneration information in annual reports in accordance with the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Rule 2014 (PGPA Rule). Commonwealth entities are required to present remuneration for key management personnel, senior executives and other highly paid staff, as defined in the PGPA Rule. Key management personnel Key management personnel (KMP) are those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the entity, directly or indirectly, including any director (whether executive or otherwise) of that entity. The Corporation determined KMP as the members of the Board, the Managing Director, Content Team Directors and the Chief Financial Officer. Senior executives Senior executives are employees employed in a position equivalent to classification Groups 9 to 11 of the table in Schedule 1 to the Public Service Classification Rules 2000. The Corporation determined senior executives as executive directors who are not KMP (senior executives) . Other highly paid staff Other highly paid staff are employees who are neither KMP nor senior executive and whose total remuneration paid during the year exceeded $230,000 (other highly paid staff) .Total remuneration Total remuneration is defined in the PGPA rule as the sum of the following (calculated on an accrual basis): a. base salary b. performance pay and bonuses c. other benefits and allowances d. superannuation contributions (made by the employer) e. longservice leave f. other longterm benefits g. termination benefits. Executive and employee remuneration policy At the core of the ABC's approach to remuneration is a need to ensure the Corporation can realise its strategic priorities through an ability to attract and retain employees who deliver on its priorities and deliver value for audiences into the future. 204 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2021Remuneration principles Remuneration frameworkEquitable We ensure our remuneration approach is consistent and equitableMarket competitive We attract and retain the best talent to meet our current and future workforce needsPerformance aligned We recognise and reward for contribution to performance goals and targetsTransparent We have a transparent and disciplined approach to managing remuneration decisions and costs Fixed remuneration At risk remuneration Element Fixed remuneration comprises base salary, superannuation and benefits.During the year ended 30 June 2021, executive KMP, senior executives and some other highly paid staff were eligible to receive an atrisk payment based on the achievement of performance targets. Some other highly paid staff were eligible to receive a performance bonus payment in accordance with terms in relevant enterprise agreements. During the year ended 30 June 2021, the Corporation determined to phase out at risk pay for executive KMP, senior executives and other highly paid staff. The phase out of atrisk remuneration was completed during the year. Determination of performance outcomes and final atrisk payments will be completed during the year ended 30 June 2022. The Commonwealth Remuneration Tribunal (the Tribunal), consented to the removal of atrisk pay for the Managing Director from 1 June 2018. Performance Reviewed annually to reflect the experience, competence and contribution of individuals whilst remaining conservatively competitive against the market.For executive KMP and senior executives, half of the atrisk opportunity was linked to ABC corporate objectives and half was linked to individual objectives. Some other highly paid staff were eligible to receive an atrisk payment for the achievement of performance targets, some were eligible to be paid a performance bonus in accordance with the terms in the Senior Employment Agreement 2016 and some were eligible to be paid a bonus in accordance with the ABC Enterprise Agreement 201922 . Alignment Attracts and retains the best talent to meet ABC's strategic priorities.Varies annual remuneration up or down to reflect contribution, aligned with ABC's strategic priorities. Target remuneration mix Executive KMP (excluding MD) and senior executives Eligible other highly paid remuneration At-risk remuneration All executive KMP, senior executives and other highly paid staff are employees of the ABC. Remuneration and other terms of employment are formalised as follows: executive KMP and senior executives (executives) - individual employment agreement other highly paid staff - individual employment agreement or engaged through either the ABC Senior Employment Agreement 2016 or the ABC Enterprise Agreement 201922 . During the year ended 30 June 2021, ABC's Audit & Risk Committee (ARC) assisted the Board in fulfilling its governance responsibilities in relation to remuneration. Outlined below is the ABC's approach for setting, monitoring and approving remuneration policy and amounts. Note that the Managing Director's (MD) remuneration arrangements, including the MD's annual total remuneration amount, are set by the Commonwealth Remuneration Tribunal (the Tribunal) .Non-executive director (NED) remuneration All ABC NEDs are appointed by the Commonwealth of Australia through the Shareholder Ministers. The Commonwealth Remuneration Tribunal, an independent statutory body overseeing the remuneration of key Commonwealth offices, determines fees for all ABC NEDs. ABC is required to comply with the Tribunal's determinations and plays no role in the consideration or determination of NED fees. The Tribunal sets annual Chair, Deputy Chair and Board Member fees (exclusive of statutory superannuation contributions), which are inclusive of all activities undertaken by NEDs on behalf of the ABC (that is, inclusive of Committee participation). Statutory superannuation is paid in addition to the fees set by the Tribunal. The Commonwealth Remuneration Tribunal determination for the relevant period set the following ABC Board fees: Chair: $178,190 Deputy Chair: $87,970 Member: $58,670 MD ARC ABC Board Recommend executive KPIs Review and recommend to the Board executive remuneration structures and incentive plans, policies and practices including any changes to those plans Review and approve recommendations referred by the RAC Evaluate and provide recommendations regarding remuneration structures and incentive plans for executives, including any changes to those structures or plans Approve executive remuneration with respect to individual remuneration arrangements, KPIs, performance assessments and remuneration outcomes Approve performance assessments and remuneration outcomes for other highly paid staff, as recommended by ABC's managers 206 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2021Key management personnel remuneration Name Position titleShort-term BenefitsPost- Employment BenefitsOther long-term benefits Termination benefits and contributionsLong service benefits AndersonManaging - 144,251 - - - - 195,350 Jane ConnorsStaff Elected Director55,737 - 9,698 - 65,435 Kirstin FergusonDeputy 28,898 Fiona BalfourDirector 9,778 - - 929 - - - 10,707 Mario D'OrazioDirector 9,778 - - 929 - - - 10,707 Joseph GershDirector 55,737 - - 5,295 41,069 - - 3,902 - - - 44,971 Peter Lewis Director 55,737 - - 8,583 - - - 64,320 Georgina SomersetDirector 55,737 - - 5,295 - - - 61,032 Peter TonaghDirector 9,778 - - 929 - - - 10,707 Donny WalfordDirector 22,001 - - 2,090 - - - 24,091 Notes on remuneration: 1.

Remuneration at risk is recognised in the period in which the decision to pay the entitlement is made. Other longterm employee benefits: Long Service Leave reflects the estimated entitlement to long service leave that was accrued during the period, calculated in accordance with the methodology explained in Note 10 Employee Provisions . This includes changes to the value of an employee's accrued leave entitlement that resulted from a change in their salary during the period. 4. The above key management personnel remuneration excludes the remuneration and other benefits of the Portfolio Minister. The Portfolio Minister's remuneration and other benefits are set by the Remuneration Tribunal and are not paid by the Corporation. 5. Remuneration of the Chair and Directors of the Board is determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. In addition to the remuneration of the Chair and Directors of the Board disclosed above, the Board incurred expenses of $217,373 (2020 $311,228).

advised the ABC that it would no longer fund the ongoing repair and maintenance of transmitters at 77 sites across Australia. The sites were created as part of the switchover to digital television around a decade ago, and were the responsibility of RBAH. Following the failure of one of the transmitters at Eastgrove near Goulburn in New South Wales on 6 August 2020, the ABC agreed to fund the maintenance of these transmission services provided by RBAH. The ABC's agreement is exclusive of the capital costs required to repair any service in the event of failure. RBAH was formed by regional commercial television broadcasters to build these transmission towers to cover black spots in their licence areas, which had become apparent during the switchover from analog to digital television.Digital Television Area Served Channel ACTConder 35 NSWWalwa/Jingellic 51 Bermagui Bungendore 46 Cootamundra 46 Eastgrove 28 Eugowra 41 Grenfell 28 Gundagai 40 Gunning 40 Harden 40 Junee 34 Merimbula 35 Mount Kembla 46 Mudgee Town 47 Narrandera 34 Peak Hill 47 Wellington 47 West Wyalong 40 Hillston 40 Anna Bay 46 Belmont North 28 Byron Bay 41 Elizabeth Beach 46 Coffs Harbour North28 Forster 40 Medowie 41 Bulahdelah 46 Maclean/Ashby 46 Ocean Shores 48 Smiths Lake 40 Stroud 41 Boambee/Sawtell 46 Uralla 46 Warialda 46 Warners Bay 28 Woolgoolga 46 QLD Agnes Water 46 Cooloola Cove 46 Nanango 46 Peregian Beach 29 Toowoomba East 40 Point Arkwright 29 Rainbow Beach 34 Sarina Beaches 41 Tin Can Bay 34 Toowoomba South 40 Wonga Beach 34 Yarraman 35 SA Morgan 41 Orroroo 46 41 46 Birchip Boolarra 28 Wycheproof 40 Appendices 221Appendix 12 - Radio transmission frequencies Digital Radio Area ServedFrequency (MHz)Channel Block 206.352 (9C)Transmitter Statistics for 2020-21 The transmitter numbers for Fully Managed Services are provided by Broadcast Australia with the apparatus licences held by the ABC and for the RBAH Provided Services, the apparatus licences are held by RBAH.
