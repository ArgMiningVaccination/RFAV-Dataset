In a health consultation I provide a caring space to listen to your health concerns. It is important to give you the time and encouragement to express and explain your health issues and I guide you with pertinent questions that will help us to get at the root causes of your imbalances. Would you like to discover and address the root cause of your health concerns instead of just treating the symptoms ? Have you been wondering what herbs and foods you could use to improve your health and help bring more vitality into your life? Are you frustrated with the lack of time and attention that your doctor provides? Would you like to know if there are healthier, more \"natural\" options to help with your health concerns? Would you like guidance to try and reduce your side effects from medications? Would you like to add in herbs and nutrition to supplement your health plan that you are working on with your doctor? If you answered yes to any of the questions above then do yourself a favor and schedule a consultation with Kimberly to begin on your journey towards deeper health and vitality. Your First Consultation The first consultation will take between 1 and 1 \u00bd hours. The systems in our bodies are all interconnected and so it is important that we go over each one in order to discern how each organ system is affecting the other and affecting the body as a whole. When I figure out what herbs will be best for an individual I draw from my herbal knowledge which incorporates both folk and clinical herbalism. For me, Folk herbalism includes teachings from present and past healers and cultures whose plant healing is based on experience, ancestral knowledge and a deep connection with nature and the plant beings. Clinical herbalism is based on clinical experience with plants and healing and also draws from scientific research. This research ranges from the level of the test tube, to animal studies, to human clinical trials. By drawing on both traditional plant healing and current scientific research PLUS using my own intuition and connections with the plants, I craft a unique herbal protocol for each individual. I also believe that it is vitally important that we approach our healing bytaking into consideration our emotions, mind and spirit as well as our bodily functions. Fortunately plants can also help us heal on these levels as well when used with intention and/or ritual. For this reason I also offer guided meditations and plant cleansings and rituals. These practices can help you to relax and connect with your inner essence (or \"core\") and from this place I help guide you to discover what areas in your body, mind and spirit need attention and healing. Your Personalized Health Protocol After each consultation I will send you a written up, personalized Health Protocol either by email or snail mail and I will also send you your herbal formula/s (unless we decide otherwise). Your Health Protocol can include recommendations for: tinctures (alcoholic/glycerine extracts of herbs), teas, herb powders, flower essences, supplements, nutritional suggestions and stress-reducing techniques. In this write up I also explain what seems to be going on in your body, where and what we should begin working with first and why. I explain why I choose certain herbal formulas and how they will be working with your body (spirit too). I am also very open and willing to communicate with your other health-care providers with the hopes of creating the best health plan for you and to inquire about testing and medications. "}
