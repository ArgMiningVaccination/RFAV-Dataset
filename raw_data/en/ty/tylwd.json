ImmunoCult Human Th1 Differentiation Supplement Produces Differentiated CD4+CD45RA-CD45RO+ Cells Under Th1 Polarizing Conditions Na\u00efve CD4+ T cells were isolated from human peripheral blood samples using the EasySep Human Na\u00efve CD4+ T Cell Isolation Kit (Catalog #19555). Cells were stimulated with ImmunoCult Human CD3/CD28 T Cell Activator (Catalog #10971) and ImmunoCult Human Th1 Differentiation Supplement (Catalog #10973), cultured in ImmunoCult-XF T Cell Expansion Medium (Catalog #10981) for 7 days. Shown are flow cytometry results of cell samples stained and analyzed for expression of CD45RA and CD45RO (A) before and (B) after 7 days of culture. After 7 days the majority of cells in culture display a memory T cell phenotype (CD45RA-CD45RO+). Figure 2. ImmunoCult Human Th1 Differentiation Supplement Produces More Differentiated CD4+CD45RA-CD45RO+ Cells Under Th1 Polarizing Conditions Than Competitor Na\u00efve CD4+ T cells were isolated from human peripheral blood samples using the EasySep Human Na\u00efve CD4+ T Cell Isolation Kit (Catalog #19555) and cultured with ImmunoCult Human CD3/CD28 T Cell Activator (Catalog #10971) and ImmunoCult Human Th1 Differentiation Supplement (Catalog #10973) in ImmunoCult and differentiated (CD45RA-CD45RO+) cells after culture was compared after staining cells for CD45RA and CD45RO and analysis by flow cytometry. The percentage of cells expressing a na\u00efve phenotype was significantly lower and the percentage of cells expressing a differentiated phenotype was significantly higher with ImmunoCult than with competitor medium and activator. Shown are the differences in the percentage of na\u00efve and differentiated T cells in either ImmunoCult (purple) and competitor (grey) culture conditions (mean \u00b1 S.E.M.; *p < 0.05; paired t-test on logit transformed data; n = 4). Figure 3. Culture with ImmunoCult Human Th1 Differentiation Supplement Produces More IFN-Expressing Cells Than Culture Under Competitor Conditions Na\u00efve CD4+ T cells were cultured for 5 days in ImmunoCult activator, supplement and medium, or competitor medium and activator using the protocol described in Figure 2. After culture, differentiated CD4+ T cells (CD45RA-CD45RO+) were analyzed for IFN and IL-4 (not shown) expression, following stimulation with PMA and Ionomycin for 4 hours. A greater percentage of cells generated with ImmunoCult expressed intracellular IFN compared to those generated under competitor conditions, while no significant difference was found in the percentage of cells which expressed intracellular IL-4, with very low numbers of cells expressing IL-4 for both ImmunoCult and competitor. Shown are the differences in the percentage of na\u00efve and differentiated T cells in either ImmunoCult (purple) and competitor (grey) culture conditions (mean \u00b1 S.E.M.; *p< 0.05; paired t-test on logit transformed data; n = 4).
