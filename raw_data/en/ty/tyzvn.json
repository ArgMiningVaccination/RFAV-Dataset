This research paper mainly deals with the villagers' perception about diseases which are commonly found in the village. It also contains a discussion on the existing position regarding mode of treatment in the village. The research was conducted in Village Zandra, District Ziarat in the province of Balochistan. An effort has been made to find out the medical system working in the village which included both beliefs and perceptions related to health and illness and also the activities which natives have adopted or developed to maintain and restore their health. Initially the natives were using traditional and spiritual healing systems, but now, as their economic condition and literacy rate are improving they are more inclined towards the modern methods of treatment. During the last 3 decades few changes have been witnessed. Shift from subsistence to market economy has increased the use of allopathic medicines due to which the natives have started opting for secondary sources of income. This research paper would explore the application of world systems analysis to the health care systems. While discussing the relationship between the developed and underdeveloped countries on health related issues most of the writers have used the term political economy of health. This term refers to the analysis of health policy and the development, health service in a broader macro-economic and political context. This article will analyze these changes in light of world system theory at micro level. The data presented in this paper has been collected by using qualitative anthropological research techniques. This research paper is an attempt to investigate the traditional ways of treatment adopted by the natives of village Bhangali Gujar in district Rawalpindi. An effort has also been made to recognize the community's inclination of diverse human services frameworks and effect of advancement on essential health hones over the group.

Artuklu Human and Social Science Journal 2018 This study explores traditional beliefs and practices on the supernatural beings as well as their effects in Southeast Anatolian society. Case studies from six provinces of Southeast Anatolia indicate that there are still severe socio-psychological effects of the demonic possession, albeit constant debate about the existences of supernatural beings is seen throughout the region. While the religious and sacred books have a different approach to this issue, this field study illustrates that the supernatural forces are mostly regarded with exaggeration and great fear. Moreover, the people in Southeast Anatolia seem to be inherited the traditional beliefs and practices of supernatural beings from their religious, cultural and socio-environmental background. Background: Traditional healing practice is an important and integral part of healthcare systems in almost all countries of the world. Very few studies have addressed the holistic scenario of traditional healing practices in Bangladesh, although these serve around 80% of the ailing people. This study explored distinctive forms of traditional healing practices in rural Bangladesh. Methods: During July to October 2007, the study team conducted 64 unstructured interviews, and 18 key informant interviews with traditional healers and patients from Bhabanipur and Jobra, two adjacent villages in Chittagong district, Bangladesh. The study also used participatory observations of traditional healing activities in the treatment centers. Results: Majority of the community members, especially people of low socioeconomic status, first approached the traditional healers with their medical problems. Only after failure of such treatment did they move to qualified physicians for modern treatment. Interestingly, if this failed, they returned to the traditional healers. This study identified both religious and non-religious healing practices. The key religious healing practices reportedly included Kalami, Bhandai, and Spiritual Healing, whereas the non-religious healing practices included Sorcery, Kabiraji, and Home Medicine. Both patients and healers practiced self-medication at home with their indigenous knowledge. Kabiraji was widely practiced based on informal use of local medicinal plants in rural areas. Healers in both Kalami and Bhandari practices resorted to religious rituals, and usually used verses of holy books in healing, which required a firm belief of patients for the treatment to be effective. Sorcerers deliberately used their so-called supernatural power not only to treat a patient but also to cause harm to others upon secret request. The spiritual healing reportedly diagnosed and cured the health problems through communication with sacred spirits. Although the fee for diagnosis was small, spiritual healing required different types of treatment instruments, which made the treatment implicitly expensive. The study was carried out in the 15 Bangru inhabited villages of Sarli circle in Kurung Kumey district of Arunachal Pradesh. It focuses on perception of illness and health ideology among Bangrus; the people belong to one of the numerically weak less-known tribal communities of Arunachal Pradesh. They describe multi-cause for a single illness and believe that most of the diseases are caused by supernatural powers. Their mode of treatment includes both indigenous and allopathic health care system. Their belief in multi-causational speculation regarding occurrence of physical and mental discomfort, past experience, faith and other socio-cultural direct them that as and when, which system should be used. Keywords: Bangru; Deities; Supernatural Powers; Physical and Mental Illness; Allopathic Doctor This paper gives an overview of anthropological and folklorstic approaches to belief, and proposes its examination as a response to specific contextual factors. It approaches belief as emerging from \"participatory consciousness,\" a state of mind that exists alongside rational consciousness in all human societies. Examples are drawn from the cultures of magico-religious healers in Italy and modern Pagans in North America and Western Europe.
