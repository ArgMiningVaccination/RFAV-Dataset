During the other week of the DLW phase, participants will wear the Intelligent Device for Energy Expenditure and Activity (IDEEA) monitor and Actical monitor. Whether the participants wear the monitors first or complete digital photography first will be randomozed. Participants who complete the first two weeks and have a BMI over 25kg/m2 will receive a partial supplement low-calorie diet (LCD) for 8 weeks. This diet plan is a 1000-1150 kcal/day diet that participants will complete in a free-living environment. All participants will return to follow-up at six and twelve months after they completed the LCD. Anthropometric and questionnaire data will be collected. | Behavioral: Digital Photography of Foods | The digital photography of foods method was developed to unobtrusively measure energy intake in naturalistic settings (e.g., cafeterias). Participants will be provided with cell-phones with digital cameras and cellular network capability. Participants were trained to take pictures of their food selection and plate waste and to send these pictures to the researchers over the cellular network. The participant will collect data in free-living conditions and these data will be collected in near real time. Other Name: digital photography Other: doubly labeled water Doubly labeled water, considered the gold standard for measuring energy intake in humans, was used to measure total daily energy expenditure during free-living conditions. DLW is used to obtain an accurate measure of total daily energy expenditure, which is equal to energy intake during energy balance. Other Name: Doubly labeled water (DLW) Device: IDEEA The Intelligent Device for Energy Expenditure and Activity (IDEEA) will be used to measure the time spent engaging in active vs. sedentary behaviors, and the energy costs of these behaviors. Other Name: Intelligent Device for Energy Expenditure and Activity Behavioral: low-calorie diet Participants will be instructed to consume five packets of Health One per day, which provides 800 kcal and 125% of Recommended Daily Intake of vitamins and minerals. Additionally participants will be instructed to consume a meal consisting of 200 kcal to 350 kcal daily, which could consist of a portion-controlled meal replacement or a home-cooked meal. Participants will meet with a Registered Dietitian at weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6 and receive instructions on adhering to the meal plan.

During the other week of the DLW phase, participants will wear the Sensewear armband. Whether the participants wear the monitor first or complete digital photography first will be randomozed. Participants who complete the first two weeks and have a BMI over 25kg/m2 will receive a partial supplement low-calorie diet (LCD) for 8 weeks.

Digital photography (RFPM) EI was tested against measured food provisions during an in-feeding period and against EI measured with doubly labeled water (DLW) during free-living conditions for 1 week. EI measured by directly weighing food provisions in the clinic over two days and measuring food intake during free-living conditions over one week with the DLW. - Weight Change [ Time Frame: 1 year ]The secondary aim was to test if posture allocation (the amount of time spent engaging in certain behaviors e.g., sitting, walking, running, changing positions and the energy burned during these activities) predicts weight change over one year following a period of weight loss. - Total Energy Expenditure (TEE) and Activity Energy Expenditure (AEE) Predictions From Actical, IDEEA, and Sensewear Monitors (kcal/Day) [ Time Frame: 1 week ]Bland-Altman analyses compared the TDEE and AEE from the Sensewear\u00ae and IDEEA and Actical monitors to the DLW data from the week participants wore the monitors. Only the week of DLW data that corresponded with the wearing of the monitors was used for this analysis. - Device Predictions of % Weight Change During and After an 8-week LCD [ Time Frame: 8 weeks ]This secondary aim of the study was evaluated with linear regression analysis to determine if TEE, AEE, or measures of posture allocation predicted weight loss during the 8-week LCD. Percent weight change from diet initiation to termination was the dependent variable for the weight loss regressions. Of the 87 participants considered for these secondary analyses, five were excluded because they did not finish baseline accelerometry assessment, and an additional five were excluded because they did not enter the LCD phase due to BMI's < 25. Finally, seven more participants from this original sample were excluded because they did not successfully complete all aspects of the DLW dosing period. Finally, an additional 4 subjects were lost to follow up during the 8-week LCD period. Thus, 66 participants were included in the analysis Choosing to participate in a study is an important personal decision.
