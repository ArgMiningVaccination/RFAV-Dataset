Bean, MPH Joseph Catania, PhD Overview Vaccines save millions of lives a year Oregon parental exemptions Vaccine -opposing populations outbreaks of vaccine -preventable diseases (VPDs) Health care providers (HCPs) seen as trustworthy (e.g., Baker et al., 2007; Gangarosa et al., 1998; Kennedy et al., Omer et al., 2008, Atwater et al., 2013 \u2014in press) Vaccines Save Lives Smallpox \u201430% mortality rate H.influenza B\u2014before vaccine, 386,000 deaths worldwide Polio \u2014U.S. 1952, 21,000 infected; 2012, 0 persons infected \u2014disease eradication achieved, nearly extinct Malaria vaccine possible, but still challenging. kills 1M each year.

HCPs whether a parent will agree to vaccinate her children The public is increasingly turning to complementary and alternative medical (CAM) providers, who are less likely to recommend vaccination (Downey et al., 2010; Gust et al., 2009, Kennedy et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2005; Moseley et al., 2001; Tindle et al., 2005) CAM Providers CAM providers influence vaccine decisions CAM modalities are popular in Oregon \u201414% higher than U.S. average E.g., in Oregon, midwife -attended births 9% in 1990 to 16% in 2009 , up 89% Top 10 percent of states w/midwife -attended vaginal births. CAM providers are more likely than allopathic practitioners to oppose vaccination (e.g., Downey et al., 2010) They are likely to doubt vaccine benefit or efficacy (e.g., Abhyankar et al., 2008) Many believe vaccines cause illness (e.g., Busse et al., 2005) Prefer infection -driven immunity \u2014\"natural is best\" (e.g., Russell et al., 2004) Many distrust government agencies and scientific research (e.g. Salmon et al., 2005) Background CAM Provider Beliefs Questions : Do CAM personal and professional beliefs affect their vaccination views and recommendations? Do CAM views about the immune system affect their vaccination views and recommendations? CAM populations studied (NCCAM domains /modalities) Alternative medical system: Homeopathy AMS, natural -product based: Naturopathy Manipulative, body based: Chiropractic AMS, energy -based: Acupuncture Evolutionary biologically adaptive, ancient practice: Midwifery The Rise of Vaccine Opposition Vaccine resistance in Oregon Factors in opposition Mainstream medical (MM) providers CAM providers Vaccine Avoidance Outbreaks of pertussis and measles are linked to low vaccination rates, decline in efficacy over time, vaccine avoidance Pertussis is a scary disease for parents; it lasts for months, can be fatal, and is preventable! It is also underdiagnosed Here's what whooping cough sounds like \u2014 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIV460AQUWk Herd Immunity [Table modified from Epid Rev 1993;15: 265 -9); -38.] Herd Immunity Thresholds for Seven Vaccine -preventable Diseases R0 is the basic reproduction number , or the average number of secondary infectious cases produced by a single index case in completely susceptible population.

Census tracts within an exemption cluster were 2.5 times more likely to be in a pertussis cluster (OR = 2.47, 95% CE: 2.22 -2.75 Dissertation Research Significance Innovation CAM modalities for this study Photo courtesy \u00a9 U.S Baha'i Media Bank Qualitative Research Design Qualitative Research Design Semi -structured Responsive Interviews Iterative Interpretative Analysis Non-probability snowball sample Thematic Coding Modified Grounded Theory Study Innovation No similar study of 5 CAM provider populations Provides new insights into the influences on CAM career choices, vaccine beliefs, norms, and decision -making.

Why do CAM providers believe vaccines cause illness? Why do these providers prefer infection -driven immunity, when it can be so risky? Why do so many CAM providers distrust government agencies and scientific research ? Research Questions Immunology beliefs Personal experience Professional group norms Belief that profit motive drives vaccine promotion, collusion between gov't agencies and Big Pharma Themes Official position is that \" Safer, more effective vaccinations should be developed\"1 Emphasizes parental informed consent (i.e., consent to accept supposed vaccine risks and dangers) 1 Group Norms: Naturopathy 1American Association of Naturopathic Physicians, 1991 Naturopathic Doctors (NDs) consider themselves more humane than mainstream medical (MM) doctors \"Natural is best\" Group Norms: Naturopathy Naturopathic Doctors (NDs) consider themselves more humane than mainstream medical (MM) doctors \"Natural is best\" Immunology Beliefs: Naturopathy Fevers ... clean the system and keep people from getting cancer.

The body has an inherent ability to heal, so the physicians' role is to try understand obstacles to healing and ... remove what's stopping the body from doing what it's wanting to do. No naturopath supported vaccination. Most recommended a delayed schedule, and several mistakenly believed that vaccines compromise the infant's immune system. Naturopathy No naturopath supported vaccination. Most recommended a delayed schedule, and several mistakenly believed that vaccines compromise the infant's immune system. (Hold that thought) Naturopathy Strong influence from peers who oppose vaccines and from CE course content that questions vaccines or emphasizes risks over benefits Group Norms: Chiropractic In the company I keep... there are plenty of individuals that are extremely active in fighting the concept of vaccination.

[We were] taught that vaccines are completely legitimate and helpful. It was afterwards that I started reading about... the relationship between vaccines and autism. Foundational trust that a mother can give birth without technology, and often at home (i.e., Certified Professional MWs and Direct -entry MWs) \"Natural is best\" Group Norms: Midwifery Vaccine beliefs vary from support to opposition Personal Experience: Midwifery Everybody else that I know of has followed ... an alternate vaccine schedule - I think I'm kind of out there by myself on [opposing vaccines]. Most all [midwives I know] have vaccinated their kids and I look at them and go - have you noticed that your child's health hasn't been as good since you've been doing that?

My mother, for some reason, didn't sign me up for the polio experiment that was happening early on. She thought that it could wait a while. And I'm glad, because I think those folks [who were vaccinated] got some contaminant viruses that are shown to cause cancer .

Some of that, looking back in hindsight , I probably would not have done. \"If it's old, it must be better\" \u2014Chinese medicine vs. modern, mainstream medicine Vaccines act like a pathogen in the body , diminish the body's natural energy (zero -sum, only so much energy; it can be depleted) Immunology Beliefs: Acupuncture \"If it's old, it must be better\" Group Norms: Acupuncture I heard [an acupuncturist] say, \"In Western medicine they poison people with their drugs and they cut them with their surgeries, and they burn them with chemotherapy.\" And I remember thinking, \"Well , we stick needles in them, give them herbs , and ... burn them with moxa .\" Vaccines deplete the body's core energy, or wei qi.

All disease is innate , we need to express disease, not \"fight\" it Tailor treatment to the person Immunology Beliefs: Homeopathy Profit drives U.S. health care; homeopathic remedies are inexpensive Profit Motive: Homeopathy Come fall, get your flu vaccine... 25 bucks right here. ...

It's not to cure disease. It's not to heal patients. Their one legal obligation as a corporation is to make money. \"Some people have wondered whether combination vaccines might overwhelm or weaken a child's immune system, but the immune system contains billions of circulating B and T cells capable of responding to millions of different antigens at once. Because the body constantly replenishes these cells, a healthy immune system cannot be 'used up' or weakened by a vaccine.

Without combination vaccines, parents would have to bring their children in for each vaccination and all its boosters, and the chances would be greater that kids would miss their shots.
