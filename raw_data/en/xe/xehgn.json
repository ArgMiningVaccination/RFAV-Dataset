Conditions are given on the energy (or, more generally, Lyapunov functional) that ensure solutions starting near the manifold stay near for a long time or even forever. Ap- plications are given with the vector Allen-Cahn and Cahn-Morral systems. Joint work with G. Fusco and G. Karali. May 4, 14:00-15:00, Room 201 Nonlocal models of di usion, their computation and applications Qiang Du Columbia University qd2125@columbia.edu Nonlocality is ubiquitous in nature. We present some nonlocal models that can be used to study many problems ranging from flying patterns of bumblebees to propagating paths of cracks in materials. We discuss some recent results on the development of a common mathematical framework for the analysis and computation of these nonlocal models.Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 11 May 3, 9:00-10:00, Room 201 Follow your nose: the mathematics of olfactory navigation Bard Ermentrout University of Pittsburgh bard@pitt.edu Olfaction (the sense of smell) is the oldest of our sensory modalities and has been used for millions of years for animals to nd mates, nd food, avoid predators, etc. In a large multi- investigator collaboration, we have begun to try to understand the algorithms animals use to navigate complex odor landscapes. I will describe several simple algorithms that use spatial and temporal information about the odor to locate its source. Underlying these simple algorithms is some interesting nonlinear dynamics. I will discuss the continuous dynamics of binaral search where the organism uses the concentration di erences between two sensors to steer toward the source. Depending on the odor environment, various types of complex dynamics emerge including stable xed points, periodic orbits, torii, and chaos. I will also show that even this simple algorithm works quite well in real odor plumes. Secondly, I will describe a discrete algorithm where the animal samples the concentrations at di erent time points and uses this comparison to determine the heading. By reducing this algorithm to its very simplest form, we are able to also analyze the underlying dynamics. Finally, we will show the role of \"noise\" on improving the algorithms and how it can be leveraged as a search strategy. May 3, 14:00-15:00, Room 201 Evolution-based models in cancer biology and treatment Robert Gatenby Mo\u0000tt Cancer Center robert.gatenby@mo \u0000tt.org A number of successful systemic therapies are available for treatment of disseminated can- cers. However, tumor response to these treatments is almost invariably transient and therapy fails due to emergence of resistant populations. The latter reflects the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment as well as the evolutionary capacity of cancer phenotypes to adapt to therapeutic perturbations. Interestingly, although cancers are highly dynamic systems, cancer therapy is typically administered according to a xed, linear protocol. Treatment is changed only when the tumor progresses but successful tumor adaptation begins immediately upon administration of the rst dose. Applying evolutionary models to cancer therapy demonstrate the potential advantage of using more dynamic, strategic approaches that focus not just on the initial cytotoxic e ects of treatment but also on the evolved mechanisms of cancer cell resistance and the associated phenotypic costs. The goal of evolutionary therapy is12 Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 to prevent or exploit emergence of adaptive tumor strategies. Examples of this approach include adaptive therapy and double bind therapy. The former continuously alters therapy to main- tain a stable tumor volume using a persistent population of therapy-sensitive cells to suppress proliferation of resistant phenotypes. The latter uses the cytotoxic e ects of an initial therapy to promote phenotypic adaptations that are then exploited using follow-on treatment. In pre- clinical models, application of adaptive therapy permits indenite tumor control with a single cytotoxic drug. Ongoing clinical trials using cancer treatment protocols based on mathematical models of evolutionary principles will be presented. May 2, 9:00-10:00, Room 201 Interaction of Di usion and Spatial Heterogeneity in Ecology Wei-Ming Ni University of Minnesota weiming.ni@gmail.com In this lecture I wish to report some recent advances in understanding, both mathematically and experimentally, the e ect of di usion in ecology; in particular, how interaction between di u- sion and spatial heterogeneity a ects carrying capacity which plays a central role in competition of species. May 4, 9:00-10:00, Room 201 Complexity of co-feeding transmission dynamics Jianhong Wu York University, Canada wujh@yorku.ca Co-feeding has been recognized as an important transmission route in vector-borne diseases but little has been done in terms of modeling and analyzing the co-feeding transmission dynam- ics. Here we develop a mathematical model for the vector-host population dynamics where the distribution pattern of vector-over-host is governed by the vector attachment and host groom- ing behaviors. We show this coupled system of vector-within-host distribution and vector-host interaction exhibits bi-stability and nonlinear oscillation in a very natural way.Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 13 Abstracts of Parallel Talks May 4, 10:30-11:00, Room 206 Changes in population dynamics resulting from evolutionary response to an environmental disturbance Azmy Ackleh University of Louisiana at Lafayette ackleh@louisiana.edu Prolonged exposure to a disturbance such as a toxicant has the potential to result in rapid evolution of toxicant resistance in many short-lived species. This evolution may allow a popula- tion to persist at higher levels of the toxicant than is possible without evolution. Here we apply evolutionary game theory to Leslie matrix models to obtain Darwinian equations that couple population and evolutionary dynamics. We consider two cases for which evolution of toxicant resistance may have important dynamic consequences. In the rst case, we examine how persis- tence outcomes for surrogate species may change when one species is able to persist by evolving toxicant resistance while another is not. In the second case, we consider how evolution of toxi- cant resistance may impact both predator and prey when a prey species evolves in response to a toxicant but the predator does not due to di erent time scales. May 3, 15:30-16:00, Room 201 Traveling wave solutions for predator-prey systems Shangbing Ai University of Alabama in Huntsville ais@uah.edu In this talk a recent result on the existence of traveling wave solutions for a general class of predator-prey systems with delays will be presented. The proof of this theorem will be outlined, and its applications to concrete systems will be discussed.14 Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 May 3, 17:30-18:00, Room 207 Role of community structure and household size on the propagation of tuberculosis Julien Arino University of Manitoba, Canada Julien.Arino@umanitoba.ca Some northern communities in Canada experience high tuberculosis incidence rates, compa- rable with those in much poorer countries and much higher than in the rest of Canada. There are a variety of factors at play. We focus here on the relative roles of crowding and social structure, by considering a discrete time model with transmission within and between households. This is joint work with Ryan Sherbo. May 2, 11:00-11:30, Room 201 Existence and stability of traveling pulse solutions of the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation Gianni Arioli Polytechnic University of Milan, Italy gianni.arioli@polimi.it One of the parameters of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model is the ratio epsilon of two time scales, which takes values between 0.001 and 0.1 in typical simulations of nerve axons. Based on the existence of a (singular) limit at epsilon = 0, it has been shown that the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation admits a stable traveling pulse solution for su \u0000ciently small epsilon >0. Here we prove the existence of such a solution for epsilon = 0.01, both for circular axons and axons of innite length. This is in many ways a completely di erent mathematical problem. In particular, it is non-perturbative and requires new types of estimates. Some of these estimates are veried with the aid of a computer. The methods developed in this paper should apply to many other problems involving homoclinic orbits, including the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation for a wide range of other parameter values.Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 15 May 2, 17:00-17:30, Room 206 Probability of a Major Infection in a Stochastic Within-Host Model for Viral Infection with Multiple Latent and Infectious Stages Fan Bai Texas Tech University fan.bai@ttu.edu Establishment or spread of a viral infection within healthy individuals depends on the amount of exposure to a viral source, either through virus particles or through cells that have been infected. In this investigation, we assume that a potential infection has reached the site of the healthy target cells. We apply stochastic in-host models and multitype branching processes to investigate the dynamics of a viral infection of target cells that has multiple latent and infectious stages. Our goal is to investigate the probability of a major infection after exposure to either virus particles or to cells in the latent or infectious stages. It is shown that the probability of a major infection is more likely if the virus has gained entry into the target cells or reached the latter stages of the latent infection. However, in some cases, the probability of a major infection is less likely if the introduced infected cells have reached the nal stage. The theoretical estimates from the branching process are shown to have good agreement with numerical simulations of the full stochastic model. May 2, 15:30-16:00, Room 201 Optimal Control of Immunosuppressants in Renal Transplant Recipients Susceptible to BKV Infection H. Thomas Banks North Carolina State University htbanks@ncsu.edu Individuals undergoing kidney transplants are put on a lifetime supply of immunosuppres- sion to prevent an allograft rejection. However suboptimal immunosuppressive therapy can put a renal transplant recipient at a risk of infection. The key to a successful transplant is nding the optimal balance between over-suppression and under-suppression of the immune response, a task which is di \u0000cult to achieve in renal transplant patients due to the narrow therapeutic index of immunosuppressants. We use a mathmatical model to design a feedback control loop using Receding Horizon Control (RHC) methodology. Since data is not available for all model states we use NonLinear Kalman Filtering (specically Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)) to estimate the states which do not have data available. Combining RHC and EKF we design an adap- tive treatment plan which predicts the optimal immunosuppression therapy for renal transplant recipients.16 Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 May 3, 15:30-16:00, Room 206 Foot force models of crowd dynamics on a wobbly bridge Igor Belykh Georgia State University ibelykh@gsu.edu Modern pedestrian and suspension bridges are designed using industry standard packages, yet disastrous resonant vibrations are observed, necessitating multimillion dollar repairs. Recent examples include pedestrian-induced vibrations during the opening of the Solfrino Bridge in Paris in 1999 and the increased bouncing of the Squibb Park Bridge in Brooklyn in 2014. The most prominent example of an unstable lively bridge is the London Millennium Bridge, which started wobbling as a result of pedestrian-bridge interactions. Pedestrian phase locking due to footstep phase adjustment is suspected to be the main cause of its large lateral vibrations; however, its role in the initiation of wobbling was debated. We develop foot force models of pedestrians response to bridge motion and detailed, yet analytically tractable, models of crowd phase locking. We use biomechanically inspired models of crowd lateral movement to investigate to what degree pedestrian synchrony must be present for a bridge to wobble signicantly and what is a critical crowd size. Our results can be used as a safety guideline for designing pedestrian bridges or limiting the maximum occupancy of an existing bridge. The pedestrian models can be used as crash test dummies when numerically probing a specic bridge design. This is particularly important because the U.S. code for designing pedestrian bridges does not contain explicit guidelines that account for the collective pedestrian behavior. May 2, 10:30-11:00, Room 207 Early estimates of epidemic nal size Fred Brauer University of British Columbia, Canada brauer@math.ubc.ca Early in a disease outbreak it is important to be able to estimate the nal size of an epidemic in order to assess needs for treatment and to be able to compare the e ects of di erent treatment approaches. However, it is common for epidemics, especially of diseases considered dangerous, to grow much more slowly than expected. We suggest that by assuming behavioral changes in the face of an epidemic and heterogeneity of mixing in the population it is possible to obtain reasonable early estimates.Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 17 May 4, 16:30-17:00, Room 207 On state and cycle stabilization for discrete models of population dynamics Elena Braverman University of Calgary, Canada maelena@ucalgary.ca For some values of parameters, simple discrete models (Ricker, logistic, Beverton-Holt) exhibit chaotic behavior. If a constant positive perturbation is introduced, some of the maps experience break of chaos, and a series of period halving bifurcations can eventually give birth to a stable two-cycle. However, similar stable cycles can be observed in discrete equations, once maps are modied to describe contest, not scramble, competition. Recently, several methods were developed to stabilize otherwise unstable di erence equations (proportional feedback, prediction based and target oriented controls). This is illustrated with vector modied applied to LPA (larvae-pupae-adults) model describing the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum life stages. May 2, 16:00-16:30, Room 207 Models of dynamic virus and immune response networks Cameron Browne University of Louisiana at Lafayette cambrowne@louisiana.edu The dynamics of virus and immune response within a host can be viewed as a complex and evolving ecological system. For example, during HIV infection, an array of CTL immune response populations recognize specic epitopes (viral proteins) presented on the surface of infected cells to e ectively mediate their killing. However HIV can rapidly evolve resistance to CTL attack at di erent epitopes, inducing a dynamic network of viral and immune response variants. We consider models for the network of virus and immune response populations. Our analysis provides insights on viral immune escape from multiple epitopes. In the \"binary allele\" setting, we prove that if the viral tness costs for gaining resistance to each of nepitopes are equal and multiplicative, then the system of 2nvirus strains converges to a \"perfectly nested network\" with less than n+1 persistent virus strains. Overall, our results suggest that immunodominance is the most important factor determining viral escape pathway of HIV against multiple CTL populations. To conclude, I briefly discuss ongoing collaborative work to connect the models with intra-host SIV/immune response data.18 Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 May 4, 16:30-17:00, Room 201 A PDE model of intraguild predation with cross-di usion Robert Stephen Cantrell University of Miami rsc@math.miami.edu This talk concerns a quasilinear parabolic system modeling an intraguild predation commu- nity in a focal habitat in Rnforn\u00002. In this system the intraguild prey employs a tness-based dispersal strategy whereby the intraguild prey moves away from a locale when predation risk is high enough to render the locale undesirable for resource acquisition. The system modies an earlier model considered by Ryan and Cantrell by adding an element of mutual interference among predators to the functional response terms in the model, thereby switching from Holling two forms to Beddington-DeAngelis forms. We show that the resulting system can be realized as a semi-dynamical system with a global attractor for any n\u00002. In contrast, the original model was restricted to two dimensional spatial habitats. The permanence of the intraguild prey then follows as in Ryan and Cantrell by means of the Acyclicity Theorem of Persistence Theory. May 2, 16:00-16:30, Room 206 Modeling microtubule-based transport in the frog oocyte Veronica Ciocanel The Ohio State University ciocanel.1@mbi.osu.edu In the development of egg cells into embryos, spatial di erentiation is essential in determin- ing the role of the new embryo cells in the growing organism. This spatial patterning often relies on asymmetric accumulations and transport of proteins in the oocyte. In the frog, messenger RNA (mRNA) dynamically switches between di usion and active transport states in its journey to the periphery of the egg cell, where it accumulates and creates a spatial axis of development. Using dynamical systems modeling and analysis, we investigate the transport of mRNA and its dependence on cytoskeleton structures in the oocytes consisting of microtubules. Numerical studies using model microtubule structures allow us to predict that an anchoring mechanism at the cell periphery may be key in healthy development. I will also briefly discuss other active transport processes such as neurolament transport along axons.Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 19 May 2, 15:30-16:00, Room 206 Ideal free dispersal in time periodic environments Chris Cosner University of Miami gcc@math.miami.edu Determining which movement strategies are evolutionarily stable is a signicant problem in evolutionary spatial ecology. In environments that vary in space but not in time, a variety of models predict that the movement strategies which are evolutionarily stable are those that can produce an ideal free equilibrium distribution of the populations using them. In that case a population has an ideal free distribution if all individuals have the same tness and there is no net movement of individuals. This requires the population to exactly match the global distribution of resources. In reaction-di usion-advection models and their nonlocal analogues, that can be achieved with strategies that use only local information. In this talk I will present results that extend the concept of an ideal free distribution to environments where the total amount of resources remains constant but their spatial distribution varies periodically in time. It appears that in the time periodic case achieving the analogue of an ideal free distribution using local movement by advection and di usion requires the use of information that is nonlocal in space and time, such as spatial memory. Ideal free dispersal turns out to be evolutionarily stable in the time periodic setting.

Trans- formed cancer cells are confronted with this innate and adaptive immune surveillance, and tu- mors that develop to become clinically apparent have evolved to evade the immune system. Focal therapy activates an anti-tumor immune response that can propagate through the circulatory system. The systemic distribution of activated T cells is dependent on the anatomic distribution of metastatic sites, the tumor volume of each metastasis, the site of activation, and the local therapy protocol of immune activation. We have developed a mathematical model to decipher the complex local and systemic tumor-immune interactions. Tumor growth follows expansion of proliferating cells with site-dependent growth rate modulated by the predation of cytotoxic T cells. Cytotoxic T cells are recruited in response to tumor burden and proliferate in tissues in the presence of tumor-associated antigens. Local tumor-immune interaction dynamics are20 Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 combined with a spatially distributed model of blood flow through the system of large arteries in the human anatomy to simulate the blood flow fractions into each critical organ. The model shows metastatic tumors are highly interdependent, and changes in the nonlinear tumor-immune interactions in one tumor can perturb the systemic antitumor immune response, potentially facil- itating spontaneous regression or aggressive outgrowth in distant sites. The clinical outcome of therapeutic intervention then depends on therapy-induced changes in tumor-immune dynamics both locally and systemically, as well as patient-specic initial conditions of the global disease.

To improve the patients' quality of life and possibly delay the development of resistance, intermittent androgen suppression (IAS) therapy can be given rather than continuous therapy. We consider a mathematical model of IAS therapy involving tumor cells, androgen, and the biomarker prostate-specic antigen and investi- gate parameter estimation with clinical data. Specically, we implement iterative weighted least squares inverse problems to investigate the patient-specic parameters that can be condently estimated.

The reproduction and development of ticks are closely related to the environmental factors, in particularly the daily temperature. In this paper, we adopt and propose a three-stage population model for ticks with three delays to reflect the impact of average daily temperature on the di erent developmental stages. We present some local dynamics of the model through local analysis of equilibria which are related to the short term behavior of the population, but we are more interested in the average temperature in each of the development stages on the distribution of the ticks population. Based on the local analysis of Hopf bifurcation, we will focusFrontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 21 more on the global existence and dynamics of the Hopf bifurcation. Our results show that the tick population can persist in a region in a oscillatory manner if the sum of three developmental delays fall into the critical time delay interval. To illustrate our theoretical results on global Hopf bifurcation, we will present bifurcation diagrams using delays as bifurcation parameters as well as associate solutions of the model.

We also present the formula of the limiting distribution in a particular solvable case.

Here the probability that an animal moves from the point x1tox2depends on the density at x1. Under certain conditions, we apply the higher terms in the Taylor series and the center manifold method to obtain the local behavior around a non-hyperbolic point of codimen- sion one in the phase plane, and use the Lie symmetry reduction method and Abel Operator to explore approximate wave solutions. Numerical simulation and biological explanation are presented.22 Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 May 3, 12:00-12:30, Room 206 Mathematical Biologist, Data Scientist, or both? Paula Grajdeanu Shenandoah University pgrajdea@su.edu Mathematical Biology and Data Science can be used to address practically any and all as- pects of biology and medicine, from basic understanding of biological and physiological processes, to disease and therapy modeling. Whether to improve our understanding of the environment or to cure disease and maintain health, these two quantitative disciplines are now helping bio- sciences and healthcare move forward. However, mathematical modeling - in particular through deterministic models, and data science - in particular through machine learning, o er dierent approaches. In this talk I will discuss my experiences with both these approaches, pros and cons, dierences and similarities, and what developments could be most helpful and most accessible to accelerate discovery science, empowering communities, and improve health and well being. May 3, 17:00-17:30, Room 207 Heterogeneous Viral Strategies Promote Coexistence in Virus-Microbe Systems Hayriye Gulbudak University of Louisiana at Lafayette hayriye.gulbudak@louisiana.edu Viruses of microbes, including bacterial viruses (phage), archaeal viruses, and eukaryotic viruses, can influence the fate of individual microbes and entire populations. Here, we model distinct modes of virus-host interactions and study their impact on the abundance and diversity of both viruses and their microbial hosts. We consider two distinct viral populations infecting the same microbial population via two di erent strategies: lytic and chronic. A lytic strategy corresponds to viruses that exclusively infect and lyse their hosts to release new virions. A chronic strategy corresponds to viruses that infect hosts and then continually release new viruses via a budding process without cell lysis. The chronic virus can also be passed on to daughter cells during cell division. The long-term association of virus and microbe in the chronic mode drives dierences in selective pressures with respect to the lytic mode. We utilize invasion analysis of the corresponding nonlinear di erential equation model to study the ecology and evolution of heterogenous viral strategies. We rst investigate stability of equilibria, and characterize oscillatory and bistable dynamics in some parameter regions. Then, we derive tness quantities for both virus types and investigate conditions for competitive exclusion and coexistence. In so doing we nd unexpected results, including a regime in which the chronic virus requires the lytic virus for survival and invasion.Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 23 May 2, 10:30-11:00, Room 206 Nonlinear elastic vessel wall models for studying pulmonary hypertension in cardiovascular networks Mansoor Haider North Carolina State University mahaider@ncsu.edu Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a rare but deadly cardiovascular disease. As PH advances, the relative composition of vessel wall constituents is altered. The ensuing wall sti ening in- creases blood pressure which, in turn, can induce further vessel wall remodeling. Yet, the precise manner in which these interactions occur is not well understood. Nonlinear hyperelastic con- tinuum models, capturing structural remodeling of vessel walls in the presence of pulmonary hypertension (PH) are presented. These continuum models are developed in the context of 1D fluid-structure models of pulmonary cardiovascular networks. A Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden (HGO)-type hyperelastic constitutive law for combined bending, inflation, extension and torsion of a nonlinear elastic tube is employed. Specically, nonlinear relations between blood pressure and vessel wall cross-sectional area that reflect structural alterations with advancing PH are formulated and evaluated. May 4, 11:00-11:30, Room 206 Metastasis Suppression by the Primary Tumor: A Natural Law Leonid Hanin Idaho State University hanin@isu.edu We study metastatic cancer progression through an extremely general individual-patient mathematical model that is rooted in the contemporary understanding of the underlying biomed- ical processes yet is essentially free of specic biological assumptions of mechanistic nature. The model accounts for primary tumor growth and resection, shedding of metastases o the primary tumor and their selection, dormancy and growth in a given secondary site. However, functional parameters descriptive of these processes are assumed to be essentially arbitrary. In spite of such generality, the model allows for computing the distribution of site-specic sizes of detectable metastases in closed form. Under the assumption of exponential growth of metastases before and after primary tumor resection, we showed that, regardless of other model parameters and for every set of site-specic volumes of detected metastases, the model-based likelihood-maximizing scenario is always the same: complete suppression of metastatic growth before primary tumor resection followed by an abrupt growth acceleration after surgery. This scenario is commonly observed in clinical practice and is supported by a wealth of experimental and clinical studies conducted over the last 110 years. Furthermore, several biological mechanisms have been iden- tied that could bring about suppression of metastasis by the primary tumor and accelerated vascularization and growth of metastases after primary tumor resection.24 Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 May 2, 16:30-17:00, Room 206 Predator-mediated coexistence with attractive or repulsive prey-taxis Evan Haskell Nova Southeastern University haskell@nova.edu The interactions of species can have signicant impact on species distribution and diversity. For example, resource competition between two species can lead to a competitive exclusion where one species is driven to extinction. However, it is known that the presence of a predator can mediate a coexistence between the competing species and the predator. How this predator mediated coexistence is influenced by other predator mediated e ects is less studied. Here we compare the impact on predator mediated coexistence when the predator is either attracted or repulsed by one of the prey choices. We study a system of three populations involving two competing species with a common predator. All three populations are mobile via di usion within a bounded spatial domain , but the predator's movement is influenced by one prey's gradient representing either prey-taxis (attraction) or a prey defense mechanism that is repulsive to the predator which we term repulsive prey-taxis. We prove existence of positive solutions, and investigate pattern formation through a Turing style bifurcation analysis and numerical simulation. This work is in collaboration with Jonathan Bell (University of Maryland Baltimore County). May 3, 16:30-17:00, Room 207 Circuit models of low dimensional cortical variability Chengcheng Huang University of Pittsburgh huangc@pitt.edu Neuronal variability is a reflection of recurrent circuitry and cellular physiology, and its modulation is a reliable signature of cognitive and processing state. A pervasive yet puzzling feature of cortical circuits is that despite their complex wiring, population-wide shared spiking variability is low dimensional with all neurons fluctuating en masse. Previous model cortical networks are at loss to explain this variability, and rather produce either uncorrelated activity, high dimensional correlations, or pathologically network behavior. We show that if the spatial and temporal scales of inhibitory coupling match known physiology then model spiking neurons naturally generate low dimensional shared variability that captures in vivo population record- ings along the visual pathway. Further, top-down modulation of inhibitory neurons provides a parsimonious mechanism for how attention modulates population-wide variability both within and between neuronal areas, in agreement with our experimental results. Our theory provides a critical and previously missing mechanistic link between cortical circuit structure and realistic population-wide shared neuronal variability.Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 25 May 2, 11:30-12:00, Room 206 Modeling the E ect of Antibiotic Exposure on the Transmission of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in Hospitals with Environmental Contamination Qimin Huang University of Miami qimin@math.miami.edu Both deterministic and stochastic mathematical models are developed to explore the roles that antibiotic exposure and environmental contamination play in the transmission dynamics of nosocomial infections in hospitals. Uncolonized patients without or with antibiotic expo- sure, colonized patients without or with antibiotic exposure, uncontaminated and contaminated health-care workers, and free-living Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are in- cluded in the models. Under the assumption that there is no admission of the colonized patients, the basic reproduction number R0is calculated. We prove that when R0<1, the infection-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable; when R0>1, the infection is uniformly persistent. Numerical simulations show that environmental cleaning is the most important intervention. Increasing the stay of colonized patients with antibiotic exposure in hospital will increase the prevalence of MRSA, which implies to treat patients with antibiotic exposure as e \u0000ciently and quickly as possible. Screening and isolating colonized patients at admission, and improving compliance with hand hygiene are also important control strategies.

We develop and analyze mathematical models to compare deescalation with the conventional drug use strategy, and conclude that deescalation is superior or inferior than the conventional drug strategy in di erent aspects and under di erent biological conditions. This talk will summarize the most recent mathematical analysis results.26 Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 May 3, 12:00-12:30, Room 201 Multiscale Modeling Accurately Predicts In-vivo Response of Combined IL-6 Blockade and Traditional Chemotherapy in Stem Cell Driven Cancers Trachette Jackson University of Michigan tjacks@umich.edu It is well known that growth and survival of cancer stem cells (CSCs) is highly influenced by tumor microenvironmental factors and molecular signaling, initiated by cytokines and growth factors. IL-6 is a key regulator of a number of cellular processes including proliferation, survival, dierentiation, migration and invasion and it is also commonly overexpressed in many cancers. Recent evidence shows that IL-6 is not only secreted by tumor cells, but is produced at even higher levels by endothelial cells (ECs). Research shows that high intratumoral levels of IL- 6 enhance the survival, self-renewal and tumor initiation potential of cancer stem cells. These studies of the impact of IL-6 on CSCs provide strong motivation for the development of anti-IL-6 therapies for the targeted treatment of stem cell driven cancers. In this talk, a multi-scale mathematical model that operates at the intracellular, molecular, and tissue level is developed in order to investigate the impacts of endothelial cell-secreted IL-6 signaling on the crosstalk between tumor cells and ECs during tumor growth. This endothe- lial cell tumor cell (EC-TC) model is used to study the therapeutic impact of Tocilizumab (TCZ), a competitive IL-6R inhibitor, on tumor growth and cancer stem cell (CSC) fraction, alone and in combination with the traditional chemotherapeutic agent, Cisplatin. The approach used here is novel in that it includes full receptor occupancy dynamics between endothelial-cell produced IL-6, IL-6R, and TCZ. Validation is achieved by directly comparing model predictions to data generated by a series of in-vivo experiments. This multiscale approach provided excellent predictive agreement with the decrease in tumor volumes, as well as a decrease in CSC fraction. Targeting key regulators of the cancer stem cell phenotype to overcome their critical influ- ence on tumor growth is a promising new strategy for cancer treatment. This predictive modeling framework can serve to rapidly evaluate dosing strategies for IL-6 pathway modulation, as well as providing the basis for proposing combination treatments with IL-6 blockade and cytotoxic or other targeted therapies.Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 27 May 3, 11:00-11:30, Room 206 Data and identiability in a model of cancer treatment Harsh Jain Florida State University hjain@fsu.edu Mathematical modeling has a long history in the eld of cancer therapeutics, and there is increasing recognition that it can help uncover the mechanisms that underlie tumor response to treatment. However, making quantitative predictions with such models often requires parameter estimation from data, raising questions of parameter identiability and estimability. Even in the case of structural (theoretical) identiability, imperfect data and the resulting practical uniden- tiability of model parameters can make it di \u0000cult to infer the desired information, and in some cases, to yield biologically correct inferences and predictions. Here, we examine parameter identi- ability and estimability using a case study of two compartmental, ordinary di erential equation models of cancer treatment with drugs that are cell cycle-specic (taxol) as well as non-specic (oxaliplatin). We proceed through model building, structural identiability analysis, parameter estimation, practical identiability analysis and its biological implications, as well as alternative data collection protocols and experimental designs that render the model identiable. Despite the models being structurally identiable, we show that without consideration of practical iden- tiability, incorrect incorrect biological predictions can result. We illustrate the usefulness of estimating practically identiable combinations in generating biologically meaningful insights. These results highlight the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms rather than purely using parsimony or information criteria/goodness-of-t to decide model selection ques- tions.

Our results suggest that host cells along with the mechanism of production of CD4+T cells play important roles in driving tumor dynamics. Cancer cells can be eradicated if the tumor has a small growth rate and is also not competitive. Treatments by either CD4+, cytokines, or a combination of the two are applied to study their e ectiveness. It is concluded that doses of treatments along with the tumor size are critical in determining the fate of the tumor. Tumor cells can be eliminated completely if doses of treatments by cytokine are large. The treatments are in general more eective if the tumor size is smaller. Bistability is observed in all of the models with or without the treatment strategies indicating that there is a window of opportunity for clearing o the tumor cells.28 Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 May 3, 16:00-16:30, Room 207 The spread of the invasive alga Codium fragile driven by long-distance dispersal of buoyant propagules Yu Jin University of Nebraska-Lincoln yjin6@unl.edu The secondary spread of an invasive species after initial establishment is a major factor in determining its distribution and impacts. In this study we constructed an individual-based model for the spread of the invasive green alga Codium fragile ssp. fragile along a straight coastline, in order to understand the factors governing spreading speed. Codium can spread locally through non-buoyant propagules, while long-distance dispersal depends on the wind-driven dispersal of buoyant fragments. Since fragment buoyancy is determined by light conditions, we rst modelled the buoyancy of fragments, yielding a dispersal time dependent on light conditions. We then used this dispersal time, along with empirical wind speeds and directions to calculate a dispersal kernel for fragments. Finally, we incorporated this dispersal kernel into a population growth model including survival rate and fragmentation rate, to calculate a population spreading speed. We obtained the spreading speeds under current environmental conditions along the east coast of Canada and also conducted a sensitivity analysis to investigate the potential influence of environmental shifts associated with climate change on the spread of Codium.

However, because of lack of tumor-inltrating e ector T cells, many patients in clinical trials do not respond to checkpoint inhibitor treatment. It was recently suggested that the combination of an immune checkpoint inhibitor and another anti-tumor drug, such as a cancer vaccine or BRAF inhibitor, may function synergistically to induce more e ective antitumor immune responses. In this work, we considered the combination therapies of cancer with a checkpoint inhibitor and a cancer vaccine (or BRAF/MEK inhibitor) using mathematical models. Cancer vaccine activates dendritic cells so that they induce more T cells to inltrate the tumor. BRAF kinase, is a key part of MAPK pathway of cancer cell proliferation. BRAF-targeted therapy induces signicant responses in the majority of patients. We use mathematical models with systems of partial di erential equations to explore the e \u0000cacy of the two drugs and compare the simulations with data from mouse experiments. The synergy map of combinations of an anti-PD-1 and a cancer vaccine shows that for optimal e \u0000cacy under MTD constraint, the level of dosage of anti-PD-1 should be related to the level of dosage of cancer vaccine as indicated by the optimal dose curve in the map. In contrast, the e \u0000cacy map of combination of an anti-PD-1 and a BRAF/MEK inhibitor shows that at large doses the drugs may become antigonistic: an increase in one of the drugs may actually result in an increase in the tumor volume. May 3, 10:30-11:00, Room 207 Multiple Invasion Speeds in a Two-Species Integro-Di erence Competition Model Bingtuan Li University of Louisville bing.li@louisville.edu We discuss an integro-di erence competition model for the case that two species consecu- tively invade a habitat. We show that if a species spreads into a traveling wave of its rival, or if two species expand their spatial ranges in both directions, in a direction where open space is available, the species with larger invasion speed can always establish a wave moving into open space with its own speed. We demonstrate that when one species is stronger in competition, under appropriate conditions, the speeds at which the boundaries between two species move can be analytically determined. In general there are multiple invasion speeds in the model. It is30 Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 possible for a species to develop two separate waves propagating with di erent invasion speeds. It is also possible for each species to establish a single wave spreading with distinct speeds in both directions. May 4, 11:00-11:30, Room 207 Species interactions modify the spread of vector-borne pathogens independent of transmission mode Jing Li California State University Northridge jing.li@csun.edu Many pathogens are transmitted by vectors, and transmission studies traditionally focus on vector-host-pathogen interactions. However, vectors are animals that forage in complex food webs, where they interact with individuals of many species across multiple trophic levels. These interactions might indirectly a ect pathogens by altering vector tness, movement, or feeding duration, although these e ects might di er for pathogens with di erent transmission modes. Interactions that a ect vector-host encounter rates, for example, might most strongly a ect non-persistent pathogens, which attach to vector mouthparts and are transmitted quickly; in- teractions that a ect vector feeding duration might most strongly a ect persistent pathogens that require long feeding bouts for transmission. Here we addressed these knowledge gaps by developing a model to explore the impacts of interactions such as competition, predation, and mutualism on the spread of pathogens with either non-persistent or persistent transmission modes. Interactions that a ected aspects of vector movement and feeding behavior (feeding duration, vector-host encounter rates) substantially altered rates of pathogen spread, whereas interactions a ecting vector tness (births, deaths) had relatively small e ects. These e ects of species interactions were largely independent of transmission mode, except when interactions aected vector-host encounter rates, where e ects were strongest for non-persistent pathogens. Our results suggest that including species interactions and food web structure in pathogen trans- mission models could greatly enhance our understanding of disease ecology.

We solve this problem by developing a method based on an articulated integration of three basic tools from nonlinear dynamics and statistics. We demonstrate our method by using data from a number of real-world systems. As direct causal links are key to the fundamental dynamical underpinnings of a variety of complex systems, our PCM method will become a useful tool to unlock from data the inner mechanisms of real systems in diverse disciplines. May 3, 11:00-11:30, Room 201 on-Isothermal Electrokinetics: Energetic Variational Approach Pei Liu Pennsylvania State University pul21@psu.edu A number of ion channels are observed to be sensitive to the temperature changes. These temperature-gated ion channels can detect the temperature thus regulate the internal homoeosta- sis and disease-related processes such as the thermal adaptation and the fever response. In order to understand how the temperature a ects the ion channel mechanics, we develop a Poisson- Netnst-Planck-Fourier (PNPF) system through the energetic variational approach. With given form of the free energy functional and the entropy production, we achieve the mechanical equa- tions and a temperature equation, which satisfy the laws of thermodynamics automatically. From the energy point of view, we also develop the numeric scheme which satisfy the discrete energy dissipation.32 Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 May 2, 15:30-16:00, Room 207 Age-dependent intraspecic competition in pre-adult life stages and its e ects on adult population dynamics Rongsong Liu University of Wyoming rliu1@uwyo.edu Intra-specic competition in insect and amphibian species is often experienced in completely dierent ways in their distinct life stages. Competition among larvae is important because it can impact on adult traits that a ect disease transmission, yet mathematical models usually ignore larval competition. We present two mathematical models of larval competition in the form of delay di erential equations for the adult population derived from age structured models that include larval competition. Results on boundedness and persistence are also proved. May 3, 15:30-16:00, Room 207 Backward bifurcation and oscillations in a nested immuno-eco-epidemiological model Maia Martcheva University of Florida maia@ufl.edu This talk introduces a novel partial di erential equation immuno-eco-epidemiological model of competition in which one species is a ected by a disease while another can compete with it di- rectly and by lowering the rst species' immune response to the infection, a mode of competition termed stress-induced competition. When the disease is chronic, and the within-host dynamics are rapid, we reduce the partial di erential equation model (PDE) to a three-dimensional or- dinary di erential equation (ODE) model. The ODE model exhibits backward bifurcation and sustained oscillations caused by the stress-induced competition. The ODE model, although not a special case of the PDE model, is useful for detecting backward bifurcation and oscillations in the PDE model. Backward bifurcation related to stress-induced competition allows the second species to persist for values of its invasion number below one. Furthermore, stress-induced com- petition leads to destabilization of the coexistence equilibrium and sustained oscillations in the PDE model. We suggest that complex systems such as this one may be studied by appropriately designed simple ODE models.Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 33 May 4, 10:30-11:00, Room 207 Disease models that include immigration Connell McCluskey Wilfrid Laurier University, Canada ccmcc8@gmail.com Many disease transmission models exhibit a threshold behaviour based on the basic repro- duction number R0. IfR0<1, then there is a globally asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium. IfR0>1, then there is a globally asymptotically stable endemic equilibrium. This phenomenon has been shown for many individual models that are based on ODEs as well as systems with delay, age-structure and di usion. A necessary condition for this phenomenon to occur is that there is a disease-free equilibrium. If a system includes immigration of infected individuals, however, then there is no disease- free equilibrium, and therefore the basic reproduction number R0does not exist. Let the level of immigration of infected individuals be given by W.T h e n W= 0 is the case where there is only immigration of healthy people. It is interesting to consider what happens as Wincreases from 0. Two issues arise. How does the size of R0aect the movement of the disease-free equilibrium as Wincreases from 0? Does it move into the positive orthant or away from the positive orthant? How is the calculation that the endemic equilibrium was globally asymptotically stable aected by Wincreasing from 0? Models that include immigration of infected individuals are important due to the high level of contact between di erent cities, regions and countries in today's world. Local eradication of a disease does not lead to permanent eradication due to modern levels of travel.34 Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 May 4, 11:30-12:00, Room 201 The role of outcome preferences in optimizing heterogenous disease control strategies Evan Milliken Arizona State University Evan.Milliken@asu.edu As infectious diseases spread, they do not observe city, state, regional or national boundaries. As such, underlying susceptible population has a patchy structure which suggests metapopula- tion approach to epidemic modeling. When the patches of the metapopulation are managed by dierent public health authorities, it is natural to consider heterogeneous disease control strate- gies. For deterministic models, the basic reproduction number, R0, is typically a sharp threshold separating the extinction or persistence of the disease. When comparing two control strategies, the one which minimizes R0is optimal. Stochastic epidemic models are necessary to account for inherent randomness in the initial phase of an outbreak. In this case, the disease is considered persistent if the probability of extinction is less than 1. This probability is often approximated by branching process techniques. It has been shown that R0is also a threshold in the case of branching processes. The probability of extinction is a hitting probability. In this talk, a case is made to consider other hitting probabilities to measure the e ectiveness of control strategies when outcome preferences are biased by public health authorities. A technique to approximate these probabilities is presented. Results are compared to standard techniques. May 3, 17:00-17:30, Room 206 Ecology meets economic growth: a general dynamic model framework Calistus Ngonghala University of Florida calistusnn@ufl.edu Understanding why some human populations remain extremely poor despite current devel- opment trends around the world remains a mystery to the natural, social and mathematical sciences. The poor rely on their immediate natural environment for subsistence and su er from high burdens of infectious diseases. We present a general framework for modeling the ecology of poverty and disease, focusing on infectious diseases and renewable resources. Interactions between these ecological drivers of poverty and economics create reinforcing feedbacks resulting in three possible development regimes: 1) globally stable wealthy/healthy development, 2) glob- ally stable unwealthy/unhealthy development, and 3) bistability. We show that the proportion of parameters leading to poverty is larger than that resulting in healthy/wealthy development; bistability consistently emerges as a general property of generalized disease-economic systems and that the systems under consideration are most sensitive to human disease parameters. The framework highlights feedbacks, processes and parameters that are important to measure in future studies of development, to identify e ective and sustainable pathways out of poverty.Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 35 May 4, 15:30-16:00, Room 207 Management Strategies in a Malaria Model Combining Human and Transmission-blocking Vaccines Eric Numfor Augusta University enumfor@augusta.edu The concurrent use of multiple strategies has been recommended as an e ective strategy to reduce malaria and its burden. In this talk, I will present a new mathematical model studying control strategies of malaria transmission, where the control is a combination of human and transmission-blocking vaccines, and larvacide (vector control). The existence of backward bifur- cation is established analytically in the absence of vaccination, and numerically in the presence of vaccination. Optimal strategies using vaccination and vector control are investigated to gain qualitative understanding on how di erent combinations of these controls should be used to re- duce disease prevalence in a malaria endemic setting. Our results suggest that the combination of the two vaccination controls integrated with vector control has the highest impact on reducing the number of infected humans and mosquitoes in the population. May 2, 10:30-11:00, Room 201 Transport of intermediate laments in cells Stephanie Portet University of Manitoba, Canada stephanie.portet@umanitoba.ca Intermediate lament proteins assemble in laments that organize in networks, which are in charge of important cell functions such as the regulation of the mechanical integrity of cells. The intracellular transport of intermediate laments has been recently identied as a key process for the network dynamics. Their regulated interactions with motor proteins and structural linkers result in di erent modes of motility for laments in cells. To elucidate the spatio-temporal distribution of intermediate laments in cells, mathematical models are developed to investigate the contributions of di erent types of transport. A rst model for the motion of single laments driven by antagonistic motor proteins is proposed.36 Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 May 4, 12:00-12:30, Room 207 On an Advection-reaction-di usion Competition System with Double Free Boundaries Modeling Invasion and Competition of Aedes Albopictus andAedes Aegypti Mosquitoes Shigui Ruan University of Miami ruan@math.miami.edu Based on the invasion of the Aedes albopictus mosquitoes and the competition between Ae. albopictus andAe. aegypti mosquitoes in the United States, we consider an advection-reaction- diusion competition system with two free boundaries consisting of an invasive species ( Ae. albopictus )w i t hd e n s i t y uand a local species ( Ae. aegypti )w i t hd e n s i t y vin which uinvades the environment with leftward front x=g(t) and rightward front x=h(t). In the case that the competition between the two species is strong-weak and species vwins over species u,t h e solution ( u, v) converges uniformly to the semi-positive equilibrium (0 ,1), while the two fronts satisfy that lim t!1(g(t),h(t)) = ( g1,h1)R. In the case that the competition between the two species is weak, we show that when the advection coe \u0000cients are less than xed thresholds there are two scenarios for the long time behavior of solutions: (i) when the initial habitat h0<\u0000p 4\u00002 1\u0000\u00001and the initial value of uis su\u0000ciently small, the solution ( u, v) converges uniformly to the semi-positive equilibrium (0 ,1) with the two fronts ( g1,h1)R;( i i )w h e n the initial habitat h0\u0000\u0000p 4\u00002 1\u0000\u00001, the solution ( u, v) converges locally uniformly to the interior equilibrium with the two fronts ( g1,h1)=R. In addition, we propose an upper bound and a lower bound for the asymptotic spreading speeds of the leftward and rightward fronts. Numerical simulations are also provided to conrm our theoretical results. Based on a joint paper with Canrong Tian. May 3, 10:30-11:00, Room 201 Getting our feet wet: rivers in planar flows and neuronal models Jonathan Rubin University of Pittsburgh jonrubin@pitt.edu In this work, we introduce a new change of coordinates, local orthogonal rectication or LOR, that can be applied at any selected curve in the phase space of a dynamical system. LOR, based on the Frenet frame, yields a coordinate system, the LOR frame, which allows us to rigorously study curves that are nearly-invariant in the flow. We use the LOR approach to derive a novel denition for rivers, long-recognized but poorly understood trajectories that locally attract other orbits yet need not be related to invariant manifolds or other familiar phase space structures; to identify rivers within several example neuronal systems; and to analyze how these structures impact model neuronal dynamics.Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 37 May 4, 16:00-16:30, Room 206 Using a Mathematical Model with Individual Patient Data to Quantify Dierences Between Patients with Diabetic Foot Ulcers Richard Schugart Western Kentucky University richard.schugart@wku.edu In this work, we quantify di erences in healing responses between type-II diabetic patients with foot ulcers. This work builds o of our previous publication (Krishna et al., B Math Biol, 2015), where we formulate a mathematical model to describe healing responses using averaged time-course data from another study (Muller et al., Diabet Med, 2008). In Mullers work, they collect data from 16 patients with type-II diabetes. In addition to recording wound areas, Muller also measures levels of matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12, collected from wound fluid. The patients are divided into two groups categorized as good healers and poor healers dependent upon the healing response at the four-week point. In our previous work, we use the average data to calibrate our mathematical model and quantify dierences between the two groups. In our current work, we have calibrated our mathematical model for each individual patient and have quantied di erences between these patients. In this presentation, we will discuss how our model has identied di erences across patients using a variety of techniques.

In this talk, I will present the complex dynamics and bifurcations of a toxin-dependent aquatic population model. The analytical and numerical results show that both the environmental toxin level and the depuration capability of the pop- ulation signicantly a ect the population persistence. The model exhibits a multifarious array of dynamics. While low levels of external toxin allow population persistence and high levels of toxin lead to an extirpation, intermediate toxin concentrations can produce very rich dynamics, such as transient oscillations, hysteresis, heteroclinic orbits, and a codimension-two bifurcation. In particular, a regime of bistability exists where the population is doomed to extinction or survival, depending on initial state of the system. As a practical implication of our study, the toxic e ects of methylmercury on rainbow trout are scrutinized.38 Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 May 3, 12:00-12:30, Room 207 Front Propagation Dynamics in Chemotaxis Models with Logistics Source on RN Wenxian Shen Auburn University wenxish@auburn.edu This talk is concerned with front propagation dynamics in chemotaxis models with logistic source on RN. I will rst identify the circumstances under which positive classical solutions of such chemotaxis models exist globally, which is fundamental for the study of front propagation dynamics as well as many other dynamical features. Next, I will discuss the asymptotic stability of nonzero constant equilibria of such chemotaxis models, which also plays a role in the study of front propagation dynamics. I will then consider the spreading properties of positive solutions with compactly supported or front-like initial functions. Throughout the talk, special attention will be given to the combined e ect of the chemotaxis sensitivity and the logistic damping on the above dynamical issues. This talk is based on my joint works with Rachidi Salako.

We show that such nonlocal spatial average can induce instability of constant steady state, which is di erent from classical Turing instability. In particular, for systems of two equations containing spatial averages, spatially non-homogeneous time-periodic orbits could occur through bifurcations from the constant steady state. Examples from a nonlocal predator-prey model and a pollen tube tip model will be used to demonstrate such bifurcations. This is a joint work with Qingyan Shi and Yongli Song.Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 39 May 3, 16:30-17:00, Room 201 Hopf bifurcation in a reactiondi usion equation with distributed delay and Dirichlet boundary condition Qingyan Shi College of William and Mary shiqingyan3@163.com The stability and Hopf bifurcation of the positive steady state to a general scalar reaction- diusion equation with distributed delay and Dirichlet boundary condition are investigated in this paper. The time delay follows a Gamma distribution function. Through analyzing the cor- responding eigenvalue problems, we rigorously show that Hopf bifurcations will occur when the shape parameter n\u00001, and the steady state is always stable when n= 0. By computing normal form on the center manifold, the direction of Hopf bifurcation and the stability of the periodic orbits can also be determined under a general setting. Our results show that the number of critical values of delay for Hopf bifurcation is nite and increasing in n, which is signicantly dierent from the discrete delay case, and the rst Hopf bifurcation value is decreasing in n.E x - amples from population biology and numerical simulations are used to illustrate the theoretical results.

May 4, 11:00-11:30, Room 201 Optimal dengue vaccination to mitigate Zika cases Biao Tang York University, Canada btang0606@gmail.com Zika and dengue viruses belong to the same Flavivirus family and are primarily transmit- ted by a common mosquito species Aedes aegypti. Zika outbreaks have commonly occurred in dengue-endemic areas, and cocirculation and coinfection of both viruses have been reported. As recent studies on immunological cross-reactivity have conrmed that convalescent plasma fol- lowing dengue infection can enhance Zika infection, it is important to examine whether and how dengue vaccination in a large population may a ect Zika infection dynamics due to antibody- dependent enhancement. In this study, we evaluate the impact of dengue vaccination on Zika infection dynamics through a mathematical coinfection dynamics model. We show that an ap- propriately designed and optimized dengue immunization program can not only help control the dengue spread but also, counter-intuitively, reduce Zika infections. We estimate that the optimal and critical dengue e ective vaccine coverage rates in Mexico, Brazil, and French Polynesia to be (73.6%, 99%), (51.4%, 88.2%), and (68.2%, 97.6%), respectively.

For example, infection may cause an individual to deactivate their regular community contacts (e.g. too ill to go to work or school), but concomitantly activate their contact with care- givers, either in home or hospital. This leads us to consider disease spread on a multi-layered network, where the structure of each layer evolves in tandem with the disease. Specically, we give a law of large numbers for a stochastic disease process on a dynamic layered conguration model, resulting in a simple system of ODEs. Analysis of the resulting limiting ODEs illustrates how the structure of the di erent layers of the network, and the activation and deactivation of edges in the network, a ects basic features of the outbreak such as the basic reproduction number and the nal outbreak size. Among our results is a condition for when the correlation equations of Rand are asymptotically correct. This is joint work with Karly Jacobsen, Mark Burch, and Grzegorz Rempala. May 4, 11:30-12:00, Room 207 Structural and Practical Identiability Analysis of Zika Epidemiological Models Necibe Tuncer Florida Atlantic University ntuncer@fau.edu The Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic has caused an ongoing threat to global health security and spurred new investigations of the virus. Use of epidemiological models for arbovirus diseases can be a powerful tool to assist in prevention and control of the emerging disease. In this article, we introduce six models of ZIKV, beginning with a general vector-borne model and gradually including di erent transmission routes of ZIKV. These epidemiological models use various com- binations of disease transmission (vector and direct) and infectious classes (asymptomatic and pregnant), with addition to loss of immunity being included. The disease induced death rate is omitted from the models. We test the structural and practical identiability of the models to nd whether unknown model parameters can uniquely be determined. The models were t to obtained time series data of cumulative incidences and pregnant infections from the Florida Department of Health Daily Zika Update Reports. The average relative estimation errors (ARE) were computed from the Monte Carlo simulations to further analyze the identiability of the models. We show that direct transmission rates are not practically identiable, however, xed recovery rates improve identiability overall. We found ARE low for each model (only slightly higher for those that account for a pregnant class), and help to conrm a reproduction number greater than one at the start of the Florida epidemic.42 Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 May 2, 12:00-12:30, Room 206 Modeling the E ects of Antibody Responses on HIV Dynamics under Drugs of Abuse Naveen Vaidya San Diego State University nvaidya@sdsu.edu Drugs of abuse, such as opiates, have been widely associated with enhancing HIV replication, accelerating disease progression and diminishing host-immune responses. In this talk, I will present a mathematical model to study the e ects of antibody responses on HIV dynamics under drugs of abuse. The model is parameterized using data from simian immunodeciency virus infection in morphine addicted macaques. Using our model, we evaluate how the presence of drugs of abuse alters antibody responses and how this alteration a ects the key components of virus dynamics. Furthermore, we analyze how periodic intake of drugs of abuse have impact on the global stability properties of host-virus dynamical system. May 2, 16:00-16:30, Room 201 Turing patterns in a predator-prey model with seasonality Xiaoying Wang University of Ottawa, Canada xwang4@uottawa.ca Many ecological systems show striking non-homogeneous population distributions. Di usion- driven instabilities are commonly studied as mechanisms of pattern formation in many elds of biology but only rarely in ecology, in part because some of the conditions seem quite restrictive for ecological systems. Seasonal variation is ubiquitous in temperate ecosystems, yet its e ect on pattern formation has not yet been explored. We formulate and analyze an impulsive reaction- diusion system for a resource and its consumer in a two-season environment. While the resource grows throughout the 'summer' season, the consumer reproduces only once per year. We derive conditions for di usion-driven instability in the system, and we show that pattern formation is possible with a ratio-dependent functional response or a Beddington-DeAngelis functional re- sponse. More importantly, we nd that a low overwinter survival probability for the resource enhances the propensity for pattern formation: di usion-driven instability occurs even when the diusion rates of prey and predator are comparable (although not when they are equal).Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 43 May 4, 15:30-16:00, Room 201 Using e ective boundary conditions to model fast di usion on a road in a large eld Xuefeng Wang Southern University of Science and Technology, China wangxf@sustc.edu.cn We consider a logistic di usion equation on the plane consisting of two components, a straight \"road\" and a \"eld\", in each of which the di usion rate di ers signicantly. Compared to the size of the eld, the width of the road is assumed to be small. Thus in this di usion equation multiple scales appear in two places: the spatial variable and the di usion parameter. Such an equation is not easy to solve numerically, and it is not easy to see the e ects of the road. Recently, Berestycki, Roquejo re and Rossi provide a model which is meant to resolve these issues. In this paper we rst use the idea of e ective boundary conditions (EBCs) to propose, rigorously, a di erent model: we study the limit of the solution of the original logistic equation as the width of the road approaches zero, obtaining a limiting model, in which the road now is the horizontal line with EBCs imposed on it. This e ective problem has no multiple scales and hence should be easier to solve numerically. Moreover, to see the e ects of the road, we further investigate the asymptotic propagation speed of the e ective model, showing that the road indeed enhances the spreading speed along any direction within a certain angle with the road, provided that the di usion rate on the road is of the order of the reciprocal of the width of the road.

This work is devoted to stochastic mod- els of Bovine Babesiosis, with a focus on the disease extinction and outbreak and probability distribution of the infectious adult bovine and that of infectious ticks. The stochastic models are a system of continuous time Markov chains derived based on the dynamics of determinis- tic ordinary di erential equation models, i.e., Model J in Saad-Roy et al. (BMB, 2015) and Model Aranda et al. (Math Methods Appl Sci, 2012) (which is a special case of Model J). The multitype branching process approximation is used to estimate the probability of disease extinc- tion/outbreak. Unlike the deterministic dynamics that indicate the basic reproduction number R0serves a sharp disease threshold (i.e., if R0is less than or equal to the unity, the disease dies out; if R0is above the unity, the disease is uniformly persist and becomes established, in44 Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 Saad-Roy et al. (BMB, 2015)), our stochastic models indicate, more realistically, that there is always a positive probability that disease extinction within both cattle and tick populations.

Here random undirected movement of individuals in the environment is described by passive di usion, and an advective term is used to describe the directed movement in a river caused by the flow. Under biologically reasonable boundary conditions, the existence of multiple positive steady states are shown when both the di usion coe \u0000cient and the advection rate are small, which lead to di erent asymptotic behavior for di erent initial conditions. On the other hand, when the advection rate is large, the population becomes extinct regardless of initial condition under most boundary conditions.

However, these trap counts are sparse and not necessarily accurate for indicating exact numbers, density or population sizes of Culex mosquitoes in the trapping area. In this work, we dene an \"e ective trapping zone\" for a CDC light trap and incorporate the trapping mechanism of a trap and collecting procedure into a predictive dynamical population model for Culex mosquitoes. Also, the role of blood meal hosts and mosquito biting feeding preference will be incorporated into the model. Based on the weekly surveillance trap counts data and daily weather conditions from Peel region, Ontario, we predict total Culex mosquito population sizes as well as mosquito trap counts in the e ective trapping zones.

As such, the study and development of new models are of increasing importance. We present the progress on a new immuno-epidemiological model. The within-host system is based on the data collected by Courtenay et al. (2014), showing the movement and proliferation of the parasite, as well as the IgG response. The between-host system is a vector-host model structured by time-since-infection. We compute the basic reproduction number of the between-host model and provide the stability results of the disease-free and endemic equilibria. The model exhibits backward bifurcation and existence of multiple endemic equilibria when R0<1.

The self-cycling fermentation process is a semi-batch process and the model is an example of a hybrid system. In this case, a well-stirred tank is partially drained, and subsequently relled using fresh medium when the concentration of both resources falls below some prescribed thresh- old. We consider the process successful if the threshold for emptying and relling the reactor can be reached indenitely without interference by the operator. We prove that whenever the pro- cess is successful, the model predicts that the concentrations of the population and the resources converge to a positive periodic solution. We derive conditions for the successful operation of the process that are show to be initial condition dependent and prove that if these conditions are not satised, the the reactor fails after at most nitely many impulses. We show numerically that there is an optimal fraction of the medium drained from the tank at each impulse that maximizes the output of the process. Potential applications include water purication and biological waste remediation. This is joint work with Ting-Hao Hsu and Tyler Meadows.46 Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 May 3, 17:00-17:30, Room 201 Quenched flow in symmetric multi-component FCH Qiliang Wu Ohio University wuq@ohio.edu Multicomponent mixtures support bilayers with a diversity of lipid compositions. We study a two-component FCH model with a radial symmetric potential which admits a family of quasi- bilayers with various compositional ratios between amphiphile A and B. In the absence of pearling, the compositional and geometric evolution of quasi-bilayers decouples, in the sense that the former evolution takes place in a slow time scale when the normal velocity of interface is still zero. More specically, the composition ratio satises a nonlocal equation accommodating rich dynamics. Depending on the competition between the phase separation and the quenching of the background, the composition ratio evolves into, (1) a homogeneous prole; (2) a phase separation prole where the bilayer consists of pure A regions and pure B regions; or, (3) a quenched prole in a co-dim two manifold. In last two cases, a rapid spatial variation of the composition promotes surface di usion terms from lower orders. While the evolution of phase separation proles mimics Allen-Cahn type coarse graining, novel dynamics emerges from rapid varying proles in a neighborhood of the quenched manifold: compositional proles stay nearby the quenching manifold and evolve into periodic proles with large periods.

The models are focused on outbreaks that arise from a small number of infected hosts imported into subregions of the geographical settings. The goal is to understand how spatial heterogeneity influences the transmission dynamics of the susceptible and infected populations. The models consist of systems of partial di erential equations with di usion terms describing the spatial spread of the underlying microbial infectious agents. The model is compared with real data from seasonal influenza epidemics in Puerto Rico.Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 47 May 2, 16:30-17:00, Room 207 Mathematical modeling for machine tool vibration Yanyu Xiao University of Cincinnati yanyu.xiao@uc.edu We develop a delay di erential equation that arises in the modelling of vibration (chatter) that can occur when machining a rotating workpiece using a lathe, in the case when the cut is made longitudinally.

This talk is concerned with the relation between nonlocal evolution equations and their local counterpart, i.e., classical evolution equations. More precisely, we will rst consider the classical and nonlocal dispersal evolution equations, which are used to model the dynamics of di usive systems in biology or ecology which exhibit random or local, and nonlocal internal interactions, respectively. We study the dynamics of such equations complemented with Dirichlet, Neumann, and periodic types of boundary condition in a unied way, and show that certain dynamics of classical dispersal evolution equations can be approximated by the dynamics of nonlocal dispersal evolution equations with the corresponding boundary condition and properly rescaled kernels. Next, we consider the nonlocal and classical Allen-Cahn equations where the nonlocal kernel is sign-changing. In this case, we show that the approximations of nonlocal equations to its classical counterparts do not hold in general.48 Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 May 3, 16:00-16:30, Room 206 Dynamics of Populations with Individual Variation in Dispersal on Bounded Domains Xiao Yu University of Miami x.yu@math.miami.edu Most classical models for the movement of organisms assume that all individuals have the same patterns and rates of movement, but there is empirical evidence that movement rates and patterns may vary among individuals. One way to capture variation in dispersal is to allow individuals to switch between two distinct dispersal modes. We consider models for populations with logistic-type local population dynamics whose members can switch between two di erent nonzero rates of di usion. The resulting reaction-di usion systems can be cooperative at some population densities and competitive at others. We analyze the dynamics of such systems on bounded regions. The analytic methods include ideas and results from reaction-di usion theory, semi-dynamical systems, and bifurcation/continuation theory. This is a joint work with Drs. Steve Cantrell and Chris Cosner. May 2, 11:00-11:30, Room 207 Multiple Attractors in the Simple Epidemic Model Wenjing Zhang Texas Tech University wenjing.zhang@ttu.edu Multiple recurrent outbreak cycles have been commonly observed in infectious diseases such as measles and chicken pox. This complex outbreak dynamics in epidemics is rarely captured by deterministic models. In this paper, we investigate a simple 2-dimensional SI epidemic model and propose that the coexistence of multiple attractors attributes to the complex outbreak patterns. We rst determine the parameter conditions for the existence of an isolated center, then properly perturb the model to have a generalized Hopf bifurcation, and obtain small- amplitude limit cycles surrounding the center. We further analytically prove that the maximum number of the coexisting limit cycles is three, and calculate a corresponding set of parameters. Simulation results demonstrate the case with the maximum coexisting attractors, which has one stable disease free equilibrium and two stable endemic periodic solutions separated by one unstable periodic solution. Therefore, di erent disease outcomes can be predicted by a single nonlinear deterministic model based on di erent initial data.Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 49 May 4, 12:00-12:30, Room 206 Models to assess the e ects of Wolbachia-carrying mosquito augmentations and mating competition on the control of dengue disease Xianghong Zhang York University, Canada zhangxh0322sy@gmail.com The introduction of endosymbiont Wolbachia into laboratory-reared mosquito populations is an innovative new technology, which are then released to mix with natural populations to pre- vent the mosquito vectors from reproducing dengue virus or to suppress the density of natural mosquitoes and thus break the transmission cycle of dengue disease. Two stage-structured mod- els are proposed to investigate the e ects of non-identical sex ratio releases of Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes and Wolbachia-carrying male releases with mating competition on the success of pop- ulation replacement and suppression, respectively. Analysis of the existence, local stability and bifurcation analysis of the equilibria for the two models revealed the existence of forward bi- furcation or backward bifurcation and multiple attractors, and their basins of attraction were numerically estimated. For the rst model, the e ects of mosquito augmentation for the model with imperfect and perfect transmission rates were obtained. Then three possible results for mosquito augmentation were summarized for di erent parameter regions. Further we explored an uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of solutions to estimate the e ects of di erent parameter values on the success or failure of population replacement. For the second model, global dynam- ical properties of the system without and with male releases were explored by using Lyapunov function and theory of monotone operators, respectively. Then we dened the three levels of population suppression by parameter thresholds and computed their suppression rates, also dis- cussed the control strategies for the success of population eradication. The success of population eradication will rely on assessing basic o spring number of natural mosquitoes, the selection of suitable Wolbachia strains and appropriate release amount of Wolbachia-carrying males. The results of this study will be helpful for public health authorities in designing proper strategies of mosquito augmentations for the control of dengue disease.50 Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 May 4, 11:30-12:00, Room 206 Understanding the impact of diapause and co-feeding on tick-borne disease spread Xue Zhang York University, Canada zhangxueer@gmail.com We consider the dynamic vectorhostpathogen interaction motivated by tick-borne infections. We divide the vector population by the stage before and after the vectors contact with hosts when co-feeding transmission may take place, and we also consider the case where vector development involve two time lags due to normal development and diapause. We derive threshold conditions for disease persistence and for nonlinear oscillations in the vector population and in the diseased vector and host populations. Our analysis, using a mechanistic dynamic model, shows that diapause and co-feeding transmission may generate periodic and irregular oscillations even when seasonal variations of the environmental conditions are ignored. This is based on joint work with Xiaotian Wu and Jianhong Wu. May 4, 16:00-16:30, Room 201 Computational Modeling of Cytokinesis of Eukaryotes driven by F-actin Enriched Contractile Ring Jia Zhao Utah State University jia.zhao@usu.edu Cell Mitosis is a fundamental process in eukaryotic cell reproduction, during which parent cells nucleus rst dissembles leading to DNA and chromosome replication, then chromosomes migrate to new locations within the parent cell to form o spring nuclei which triggers cytokinesis leading to the formation of two o spring cells eventually. In this talk, we develop a full 3D multiphase hydrodynamic model to study the fundamental mitotic mechanism in cytokinesis, the nal stage of mitosis. The model describes the cortical layer, a cytoplasmic layer next to the cell membrane rich in F-actins and myosins, as an active liquid crystal system and integrate the extra cellular matrix material and the nucleus into a multiphase complex fluid mixture. With the novel active matter model built in the system, our 3D simulations show very good qualitative agreement with the experimental obtained images. The hydrodynamical model together with the GPU-based numerical solver provides an e ective tool for studying cell mitosis theoretically and computationally.Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 51 May 4, 16:00-16:30, Room 201 A mathematical model of angiogenesis and tumor growth: analysis and application in anti-angiogenesis therapy Xiaoming Zheng Central Michigan University zheng1x@cmich.edu This talk presents a combined mathematical model of angiogenesis (new blood vessel growth) and tumor growth. The angiogenesis part assumes the capillary as a viscoelastic continuum whose stress depends on cell proliferation or death, and the tumor part is a Darcy's law model modeling the tumor mass as an incompressible fluid where the nutrient-dependent growth elicits volume change. We show the tumor tends to maximize the nutrient transfer by blood vessel co- option and the anti-angiogenesis treatment by using growth factor neutralizing antibody would regress the neovasculature and shrink the tumor size. However, the shrunk tumor mass could survive by feeding on mature blood vessels that resist the treatment. May 2, 12:00-12:30, Room 201 Modeling the role of white-tailed deer in geographic spread of the black-legged tick Ixodes scapularis by a spatially nonlocal model Xingfu Zou University of Western Ontario, Canada xzou@uwo.ca Lyme disease is transmitted via blacklegged ticks, the spatial spread of which is believed to be primarily via transport on white-tailed deer. In this talk, I will present a mathematical model to describe the spatial spread of blacklegged ticks due to deer dispersal. The model turns out to be a system of di erential equations with a spatially non-local term accounting for the phenomenon thata questing female adult tick that attaches to a deer at one location may later drop to the ground, fully fed, at another location. After justifying the well-posedness of the model and analyzing the stability of its steady states, we will explore the existence of traveling wave fronts connecting the extinction equilibrium with the positive equilibrium for the system. We derive an algebraic equation that determines a critical value cwhich turns out to be the minimum wave speed and the actual spread speed of the tick population. We then present some numerical simulation results to demonstrate the above results. We also explore the dependence ofcon the dispersion rate of the white tailed deer, by which one may evaluate the role of the deer's dispersion in the geographical spread of the ticks. This is a joint work with Stephen Gourley and Xiulan Lai et al.52 Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 Abstracts of Posters The poster session is held on Wednesday May 2, 18:15-19:30. Multistabillity of synchronized clusters in networks of phase oscillators Barrett Brister Georgia State University bbrister1@student.gsu.edu Patterns of synchronized clusters are observed in many biological networks, ranging from neuronal populations to reflies and ecological metacommunities. Despite signicant interest, the emergence and hysteretic transitions between stable clusters in a network of identical oscillators have still not been fully understood. In particular, the celebrated Kuramoto model of identical phase oscillators is known to exhibit multiple spatiotemporal patterns, including co-existing clusters of synchrony and chimera states in which some oscillators form a synchronous cluster, while the others oscillate asynchronously. Rigorous analysis of the stability of clusters and chimeras in the nite-size Kuramoto model has proved to be challenging, and most existing results are numerical. In this talk, we contribute toward the rigorous understanding of the emergence of stable clusters in networks of identical Kuramoto oscillators with inertia. We derive the conditions under which patterns of synchrony stably co-exist and demonstrate how inertia a ects the hysteretic transitions between the patterns. Our stability results also shed light on the emergence of transient and stable chimeras. Two-species competition with directed di usion and harvesting Ilia Ilmer University of Calgary, Canada ilia.ilmer@ucalgary.ca In the two-species competition model with logistic growth law and di erent dispersal strate- gies, the influence of harvesting (or culling) on the competition outcome is explored. Both species are harvested proportionally to their intrinsic growth, but the harvesting e ort may be di erent for the two species. In the absence of harvesting, the two competitors may coexist, and one can apply such \"small enough\" harvesting rate that the state of coexistence is conserved. In the situ- ation, when, in the absence of harvesting, one population may drive the other into extinction, by applying harvesting to the \"successful\" species one can guarantee survival to its competitor. We provide estimates on harvesting bounds that would lead to a desired outcome, be it competitive exclusion or coexistence. The analytical conclusions are supported by the numerical simulations and visualizations.Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 53 Invariant Angular Manifolds in the Goodwin Oscillator Benjamin Letson University of Pittsburgh bgl14@pitt.edu Using our new technique, Local Orthogonal Rectication (LOR), we build a moving normal frame to study the dynamics of the Goodwin oscillator near its limit cycle. The Goodwin oscillator is a standard model of genetic regulation and is widely used to model circadian rhythms. The LOR framework allows us to rectify the limit cycle while preserving and exposing the geometry of the nearby dynamics, particularly how trajectories rotate around the limit cycle. We identify novel two-dimensional, invariant manifolds, attendant to the limit cycle, which allow us to completely organize these angular dynamics. One of these manifolds serves as a separatrix for the angular dynamics and allows us to identify a region with high sensitivity to initial conditions, which may be useful in studying asymptotic phase sensitivity. Revisiting a synthetic intracellular regulatory network that is su \u0000cient for oscillations Jonathan Tyler Texas A&M University jptyler10@math.tamu.edu In 2000, Elowitz and Leibler introduced the repressilator a synthetic gene circuit with three genes that cyclically repress transcription of the next as well as a mathematical model describing it. In 2006, Muller et al. generalized the model for an arbitrary number of genes and analyzed the possible steady states, the stability of the steady states, and the possible asymptotic behavior. These previous models assume rst-order transcription, translation, and degradation, with rates equivalent among genes, mRNAs, and proteins, respectively. This assumption, however, is not consistent with current biological knowledge. Accordingly, we propose a new repressilator model allowing for di ering transcription, translation, and degradation terms. We show that, under conditions on these new functions, there is still a unique steady state when an odd number of genes are in the network. We also show that, with an odd number of genes, either the model converges to the steady state or to a periodic orbit. Finally, we compare ts of current repressilator data under the old and the new models. Fitting the data with the new model can lead to key insights into the dynamics of repression and degradation and help answer questions such as: How many repressors are necessary to inhibit transcription? How are certain proteins degraded?54 Frontiers of Mathematical Biology : Orlando, May 2-4, 2018 List of Participants (Registered as of April 24) Name Institutional A \u0000liation Email Address Azmy
