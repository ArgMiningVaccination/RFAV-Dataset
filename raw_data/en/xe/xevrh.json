This bacteria damage the tissues of the upper digestive tract like the duodenum (upper part of the small intestine). H. Pylori affects many people and can even cause ulcers. However, it is not necessary that people would show ulcers or other symptoms. Some damages the H. Pylori bacteria can do: Weakening the stomach lining: The protective stomach lining is attacked by the bacteria. Urease, a type of enzyme, is produced by the bacteria, which reduces the acidity of stomach acids. Digestive fluids like acids and pepsin can damage the stomach's cells, thereby weakening the lining of the stomach. Ultimately the stomach and duodenum get ulcers and sores. Inflammation: the bacteria can attach to the cells of the stomach. In such cases, the stomach's ability to protect itself gets compromised, and the area gets inflamed. Increased acidity: H. Pylori can reduce ph by increasing the production of acids in the stomach. Though the real reason behind it is still not known Stomach cancer: The H. Pylori bacteria can also cause stomach cancer Currently, no denite treatment is available to cure the condition. However, the therapies that can treat the condition are evolving. The resistance of microbes and side effects is increasing, and the success in eradicating the bacteria is quite less. Scientists are working on synthesizing drugs or compounds that can act as antibodies against H. pylori.

Research indicates that many plants and vegetables effectively act against bacteria due to their antibacterial properties.
