Finn Abstract Concerted efforts of tumor immunologists over more than two decades contributed numerous well-de ned tumor antigens, many of which were promptly developed into cancer vaccines and tested in animal models and in clinical trials. Encouraging results from animal models were seldom recapitulated in clinical trials. Theimpediment to greater success of these vaccines has been their exclusive use for cancer therapy. What clinicaltrials primarily revealed were the numerous ways in which cancer and/or standard treatments for cancer couldsuppress the patient's immune system, making it very dif cult to elicit effective immunity with therapeutic vaccines. In contrast, there is an extensive database of information from experiments in appropriate animalmodels showing that prophylactic vaccination is highly effective and safe. There are also studies that show that healthy people have immune responses against antigens expressed on tumors, some generated in response to viral infections and others in response to various nonmalignant acute in flammatory events. These immune responses do not appear to be dangerous and do not cause autoimmunity. Epidemiology studies have shown that theseimmune responses may reduce cancer risk signi cantly. Vaccines based on tumor antigens that are expressed differentially between tumors and normal cells and can stimulate immunity, and for which safety and ef cacy have been proved in animal models and to the extent possible in therapeutic clinical trials, should be consideredprime candidates for prophylactic cancer vaccines. Cancer Immunol Res; 2(8); 708 -13./C2112014 AACR. Introduction It has been 25 years since we reported that cytotoxic T cells (CTL) from patients with epithelial adenocarcinomas can recognize abnormal expression of the mucin MUC1 molecules on cancer cells and target them for destruction (1). Two years later, cloning of the rst gene encoding such an antigen in human melanoma cells (2) provided a molecular con rmation of the ability of human T cells to recognize human tumor antigens. These publications were preceded by at least 20 years of experiments by pioneers in tumor immunology, who showedin animal models and with human cells in vitro that tumors are detected by the immune system through the recognition ofspeci c antigens (3 -8). With the characterization of the rst few molecularly de ned antigens, the eld of tumor antigen discovery exploded over the next two decades, contributinghundreds of candidate antigens and numerous new methodsfor their discovery (9 -12). The excitement for identifying speci c tumor antigens was due to their potential to be incorporated in their many forms, as proteins, peptides, DNA,or RNA, into new-generation vaccines that could elicit or boostpreexisting antitumor immunity leading to cancer eliminationand production of long-term memory to prevent its recurrence(13, 14). Therapeutic Cancer Vaccines Vaccines for several cancers, with the greatest number being designed for melanoma, breast, and colon cancer, were quickly brought to the clinic after successful preclinical studies in mouse models. In 2011, the National Cancer Institute ClinicalTrials database (www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/search) listed 85 phase I and 143 phase II vaccine trials for 13 different cancers, but only eight phase III vaccine trials: one each inmelanoma, breast, and kidney cancer, three in lung cancer, andtwo in pancreatic cancer. This discouragingly low number of phase III trials, which is a prerequisite for FDA approval of a vaccine, is a consequence of less than encouraging resultsobtained in phase II trials. All of the phase II trials were in the therapeutic setting, after cancer diagnosis, and mostly follow- ing failures of standard therapies. Although they were notsuccessful in improving patient survival signi cantly, these trials revealed the numerous ways in which cancer and/orstandard treatments for cancer can suppress the patient'simmune system, making it very dif cult to elicit effective immunity with therapeutic cancer vaccines. Other than the rabies vaccine that is administered after pathogen exposure and, thus, could be considered therapeuticrather than prophylactic, therapeutic vaccines are unique to the cancer eld. Their development was encouraged by the commonly shared assumption that there would be a \"window of opportunity\" due to the relatively slow growth of a tumor compared with a fast-progressing pathogen infection, or the Author's Af liation: Department of Immunology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Corresponding Author: Olivera J. Finn, Department of Immunology, E1040 Biomedical Science Tower, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA Cancer Immunol Res; 2(8) August 2014 708 on August 20, 2014. \u00a9 2014 American Association for Cancer Research. cancerimmunolres.aacrjournals.org Downloaded from period of temporary remission after standard therapy, during which the vaccines could be administered. This window of opportunity has been more of an illusion. A clinical diagnosiseven of an early-stage cancer represents the nal stage of years of tumor growth and its interaction with and negative effectson the immune system (15, 16), creating a nonpermissiveenvironment for either priming immunity or enhancing thefunction of spontaneously primed immunity, or both. Many different approaches have been proposed and attempted to enhance the immunogenicity of therapeuticvaccines. They include optimization of antigens, improvement on adjuvants, coadministration of cytokines or antibodies, and triggering of activating receptors on immune cells. Some of themost successful immunotherapeutic strategies have targeted major immunosuppressive mechanisms, such as negative sig- naling to tumor-speci c T cells through inhibitory receptors CTLA-4 or PD-1 (17) to enable both spontaneous and vaccine-induced antitumor immunity. Many approaches can be applied to improve the ef cacy of therapeutic vaccines, collectively referred to as the \"push-pull\"strategy (18). Although the science supporting these reagents in combination with vaccines is exquisite and the function of many antibodies, cytokines, chemokines, enzymes, receptors,and ligands has been thoroughly studied, the wisdom of applying some or all of this new knowledge to therapeutic cancer vaccines in patients requires a more thoughtful delib-eration. To begin, accumulating evidence indicates that advanced cancer changes the intrinsic properties of human antitumor effector cells such that even when extrinsic immu-nosuppressive in fluences are removed, the effector function of antitumor effector cells is at best only partially restored. For example, treatment of melanoma-speci c T cells with anti- CTLA-4 or anti -PD-1 restores their proliferative potential but their immune effector functions such as IFN gproduction and cytolytic capacity remain signi cantly lower than those in normal cells (19). The second and more important reason has to do with converting generally nontoxic vaccines into often highly toxic combination treatments. Cancer vaccines target dened antigens that are differentially expressed between tumors and normal cells, inducing immune responses that are expected to be tumor speci c and, thus, not harmful to normal tissues. Most of the research in tumor antigen discov- ery and vaccine design has been devoted to assuring thispreferential targeting and safety. However, most therapeutic reagents proposed to be combined with vaccines are associ- ated with signi cant toxicities because they lack such speci- city. Anti -CTLA-4 and anti -PD-1 antibodies target all T cells that express these molecules and not just tumor-speci c T cells or vaccine-induced T cells, thus, often causing serious auto-immunity. Finally, an important reason that should not be ignored is the tremendously high cost of these treatments (20). The cancer vaccine eld already experienced a sticker shock when the rst therapeutic cancer vaccine, sipuleucel-T, was approved for prostate cancer at a price of more than $90,000 per treatment. This immunotherapy incorrectly named \"vac- cine\" is based on in vitro activation of a patient's T cells with autologous dendritic cells (DC) loaded with a prostate tumor antigen, PA2024, and infusion of the entire cell population backinto the patient (21). This treatment was shown in placebo- controlled phase III trials to prolong the median survival of patients with castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancerby 4.1 months (25.8 months in the sipuleucel-T -treated group vs. 21.7 months in the placebo group). This result was only 1 to2 months better than what had been achieved with standardchemotherapy treatment with docetaxel. There was no differ-ence in time to disease progression. Clinical trials are planned to combine sipuleucel-T with anti -CTLA-4 or anti -PD-1 treat- ments to improve its ef cacy, which will add another $200,000 or more to the cost. The proposed combinations of blocking,stimulating, and depleting antibodies, and of cytokines and chemokines, will turn even the more typical and much lesscostly vaccines into considerably more expensive treatments to which must also be added the cost of hospitalization due to their increased toxicity. The growing eld of immuno-bioma- terials engineering is contributing promising synthetic mate-rials that can deliver vaccines and adjuvants to speci c tissues, cells, or even intracellular compartments, or deliver costimu-latory or immunoregulatory signals, as a potentially cheaperreplacement for the expensive biologic reagents (22). This development, however, is still far in the future. Prophylactic cancer vaccines \u2014a better alternative on the horizon More than two decades of clinical trials with only incre- mental improvements in outcome strongly suggest that as long as they are relegated to the therapeutic setting, cancer vaccines alone or in combination with other therapies are not likely tochange in a substantial way the dismal picture of the currentand future cancer epidemic. The possibility of applying pro- phylactic vaccines to stop cancer occurrence or progression of premalignant disease to cancer has been considered thought-fully and proposed for nearly two decades (23 -26). Unfortu- nately, two dominant concepts in the eld have delayed their development. One was the idea that nonviral, nonmutatedtumor-associated antigens, many identi ed using immune responses of patients with cancer, are too similar and someapparently identical to self-antigens and subject to self-toler-ance that, if broken, could result in dangerous autoimmunity. The other idea, based almost exclusively on melanoma antigens, implied that induction of autoimmunity was aprerequisite for antitumor effect (27, 28). Therefore, cancervaccines would only be acceptable in patients with advanced cancer, who are left with few options. With the exception of melanoma, most animal tumor models did not support eitherof these ideas. Impressive successes in cancer prevention with vaccines against viruses that cause cancer, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) for liver cancer and human papillomavirus (HPV)for cervical cancer, did not in fluence as profoundly as might have been expected the development and application of vac-cines against cancers of nonviral origin. By targeting viralantigens rather than altered self-antigens, these vaccines donot raise the same specter of autoimmunity that constantly haunts cancer vaccines. The support for vaccines for cancer prevention came rst from many years of experiments in animal models, which dueto quickly evolving technologies of genetic engineering have inVaccines for Cancer Prevention www.aacrjournals.org Cancer Immunol Res; 2(8) August 2014 709 on August 20, 2014. \u00a9 2014 American Association for Cancer Research. cancerimmunolres.aacrjournals.org Downloaded from recent years become progressively better and are superior representations of human disease. These models have shown that prophylactic vaccination based on various types ofnonviral and nonmutated tumor-associated antigens can be very effective and also safe (29-31). These same mouse models have clearly shown that established tumors and metastaticdisease respond only marginally or not at all to therapeuticvaccination, results that are similar to those from clinical trials, but these vaccinations are very effective in preventing cancer. Mouse models have also shown that an evolving tumor is under immunosurveillance through every step of its develop-ment, from early to late premalignant lesions to fully trans- formed and invasive tumor (32). These data suggest severalsteps in this developmental pathway where vaccines might be applied to intercept cancer progression. Studies in humans have also shown that the presence of spontaneous immuneresponses against one or more tumor antigens at the time ofcancer diagnosis is correlated with favorable prognosis (33, 34). Support for prophylactic cancer vaccines from the crossroads of epidemiology and immunology For many years, epidemiologists have been studying life events and lifestyles that either increase or decrease cancerrisk. Some of the most intriguing observations, which sug- gested that there might be important immunologic clues to discover and underlying immune mechanisms to elucidate,came from studying relationships between infections and cancer. Although the oncogenic potential of viruses such as HPV, HBV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), human herpesvirus 8(HHV8), and Merkel is well known and increased risk ofcancer is expected in some individuals who have experi- enced these infections, less clear are observations that many other viral and bacterial in fections are associated with greatly reduced cancer risk. A case -control study of stom- ach, colorectal, breast, and ovarian cancer found that child-hood diseases such as chicken pox and pertussis, as well asrepeated cold and in fluenza infections throughout life, were associated with a signi cantly decreased life-time risk for these cancers (for review see ref. 35). Similarly, childhoodmumps were shown to prevent ovarian cancer (36), and measles and mumps were associated with lowered incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (37). A large case -control study in patients with melanoma from six European countriesshowed reduction of melanoma risk with increasing num- bers of febrile viral infections and bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccinations experienced early in life (38, 39). A number of mechanisms were proposed for these results, including some immune mechanisms primarily focused on cross-reactive antigens or on the ability of early infections topredispose individuals to type I immunity required for successful cancer immunosurveillance. However, a number of additional observations from epidemiology and immu-nology studies support a different mechanism. Epidemiolo-gists have identi ed certain noninfectious but nevertheless highly infl ammatory events, such as obesity, breast feeding, mastitis, pelvic surgery, use of an intra-uterine device, andmany others (for review see ref. 35) that reduce risk of ovarian, breast, and other can cers. This suggests that itmight be the immune memory of antigenic changes brought about by acute in flammation of various tissues rather than the speci c pathogen infection that sets the stage for future cancer immunosurveillance. Simultaneously with these e pidemiology studies, tumor immunologists were discovering that immune responses to some of the best-known tumor antigens could be found notonly in patients with cancer but also in healthy individuals who have never experienced cancer. In one combined epidemiology/immunology case -control study , those indi- viduals were predominantly in the control (noncancer) g r o u pa n dh a dah i s t o r yo fm a n ym o r ea c u t ei n flammatory events than the case (cancer) group (40). This nding generated a hypothesis that cancer-risk reduction mightnot be due to type I immune memory for cross-reactive epitopes shared between patho gens and cancer but rather to immunity speci c for self-antigens that are altered either in their level of expression or in posttranslational modi cation during infections and other acute in flammatory events affecting healthy tissues. This immune memory is then called upon to eliminate cells that undergo similar antigenic alterations during malignant transformation of the same tissues. Tond supporting evidence for this hypothesis, we analyzed individuals with an active mumps infection and found anti-bodies speci c for MUC1, a normal epithelial cell antigen that was characterized as a tumor antigen due to its abnormal expression in epithelial adenocarcinomas. MUC1 is expressed on salivary glands, and it mumps parotitis causesabnormal MUC1 expression generating anti-MUC1 immunity.Later c immune memory can be reacti- vated in response to abnormal MUC1 expression on developingovarian or other epithelial tumors and participating in pre-venting tumor progression. In two case -control studies in patients with ovarian cancer, we found that women who hadanti-MUC1 antibodies were three times more likely to haveexperienced mumps and other acute in flammatory events and three times less likely to be diagnosed with ovarian cancer(40, 41). Cyclin B1 is transiently expressed in the nucleus of normal dividing cells as they transition from the G 2-to-M phase of the cell cycle, but in cancer cells and in premalignant lesions, cyclinB1 is constitutively overexpressed in the cytoplasm and alsoreleased from cells as soluble protein to be presented to the immune system. Many healthy individuals have cyclin B1 - speci c memory T cells and antibodies (42, 43). In a sponta- neous mouse tumor model, cyclin B1 vaccine prevents canceroccurrence (44). It has been reported that Varicella zoster (chicken pox) virus infection (45) or human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection (46) causes overexpression of cyclin B1 in the cytoplasm of infected cells, similar to the overexpression in cancer cells, and the cyclin B1 proteins are packaged into thevirions. Antigen-presenting cells that capture the releasedvirions can present to the immune system not only the viral proteins but also cyclin B1, thereby generating an immune memory for this future tumor antigen. Many human tumors,including lung cancer and premalignant lung lesions, abnor- mally express cyclin B1 (47) suggesting that immunity againstFinn Immunol Res; 2(8) August 2014 Cancer Immunology Research 710 on August 20, 2014. \u00a9 2014 American Association for Cancer Research. cancerimmunolres.aacrjournals.org Downloaded from this molecule, either elicited by vaccination or acquired through exposure to viral infections, would add to successful immunosurveillance. We tested in a mouse model the ability of repeated in fluenza infections or vaccines against infection-induced abnormally expressed lung antigens to promote successful lung cancer immunosurveillance. We showed that a history of two febrileinfluenza infections early in life protected mice from a tumor challenge later in life. The majority of antibodies in postinfec-tion sera recognized cellular proteins that were found abnor-mally expressed in the lungs during the infection and also on mouse lung tumor cell lines. Vaccination with a subset of these proteins in the absence of in fluenza infection protected mice from tumor challenge (48). Figure 1 combines the epidemiology data that provided the associations of infections or other acute in flammatory events with successful cancer immunosurveillance, and immunologicdata that characterized the underlying mechanism for this association, to propose three major scenarios that are expectedto affect the timing and outcome of a prophylactic colon cancervaccine. In scenario 1, the individual has acquired immune memory for abnormal epithelial tumor antigens early in lifethrough exposure to infections and other acute in flammatory events affecting normal epithelia, and has generated adaptive immune memory. This immune memory would be reactivated by the appearance of a premalignant lesion (e.g., colonic polyp)and would affect the outcome depending on its strength. One could predict a certain time of equilibrium when the lesion is prevented from progressing, but there is an eventual escape. Aprophylactic vaccine given to prevent progression of a prema- lignant lesion to cancer would be boosting this preexisting immunity to one or more of the original antigens, pushing theoutcome in the direction of a much more prolonged equilib-rium and very likely full elimination of abnormal cells. In scenario 2, the individual has not had suf cient exposure to pathogens or other in flammatory conditions. If a person is known to be at high risk for colon cancer, giving a vaccinethat incorporates one or more abnormal epithelial antigens Figure 1. A schematic diagram showing three scenarios that are expected to affect the timing and outcome of a prophylactic colon epithelial adenocarcinoma vaccine. In scenario 1, infections and acute infl ammations generate abnormal antigens that activated dendritic cells carry to the draining lymph node, where they stimulate adaptive immunity and immune memory. This immune memory can be reactivated by the appearance of a premalignant lesion (e.g., colonic polyp). Depending on the strength of the memory and of the reactivation, the premalignant lesion can be either eliminated or kept in equ ilibrium with immune control, prevented from progressing to cancer until multiple immunosuppressive cells accumulate facilitating its eventual escape from immune control. A prophylactic vaccine comprising one or more abnormal epithelial antigens expected to be expressed on colon cancer given at the time of diagnosis of premalignancy can strengthen preexisting immunity, thus pushing the outcome toward a prolonged equilibrium and full elimination of abnormal cells. In scenario 2, in the absence of pathogen exposure, the adaptive immune memory could be generated by a prophylactic vaccine and later strengthenedby another vaccine at the time of diagnosis of a premalignant lesion. Scenario 3 represents an individual who has not acquired immune memory fortumor antigens either naturally or by prophylactic vaccinations before or after diagnosis of premalignant disease. The expected outcome would be escape from immune control and fast progression to cancer.Vaccines for Cancer Prevention www.aacrjournals.org Cancer Immunol Res; 2(8) August 2014 711 on August 20, 2014. \u00a9 2014 American Association for Cancer Research. cancerimmunolres.aacrjournals.org Downloaded from expected to be expressed on colon cancer would establish strong immune memory. Given again at diagnosis of prema- lignancy, the vaccine would serve as a booster to the immunememory and the outcome should be the same as in scenario 1. Scenario 3 represents an individual who has not acquired immune memory for tumor antigens early in life and is notoffered a vaccine either before or after diagnosis of premalig-nant disease. The expected outcome would be fast progression to cancer and its escape from immune control. Prophylactic cancer vaccines as part of personalized medicine The various scenarios presented in Fig. 1 suggest that even vaccines based on shared tumor antigens that can be broadlyapplied to prevent many human tumors in many different individuals could be personalized at the time of delivery byknowing the epidemiologic and immune history of the patient.An ongoing effort that needs to be encouraged and supported is to administer therapeutic cancer vaccines in the very early stages of disease and as rst-line therapy, rather than in advanced disease. Great advances have also been made recent- ly in moving some cancer vaccines to the premalignant disease settings such as ductal carcinoma in situ , colonic polyps, and cervical epithelial neoplasms. The premalignant setting is ideal for initial testing of the ef cacy and safety of prophylactic vaccines. Because a high percentage of the individuals diag- nosed with these lesions develop new lesions within a relatively short period of time (1 -3 years), it is possible to run ef cacy trials with a great deal fewer participants and in a much shorter period of time. Furthermore, these individuals have not beenextensively treated with toxic and immunosuppressive stan- dard therapy and do not have any tumor burden, so their immune response is expected to be fully competent. We completed a vaccine trial in individuals with a recent diagnosis and removal of advanced colonic adenomas (49).Forty-one individuals were given a vaccine comprising theMUC1 tumor antigen expressed on colon cancer and also on premalignant polyps. The vaccine was very effective in induc- ing immune responses and immune memory in 47% of thevaccinated individuals. However, 53% did not respond. We have correlated the lack of response to the expanded number of circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), knownprimarily for suppressing immunity in patients with cancer.One interpretation of our results may be that responders to the vaccine belong to the scenario 1 group described in Fig. 1, inwhom the prophylactic vaccine was highly immunogenic because it served as a booster of preexisting anti-MUC1 immune memory, and we would expect it to prevent polyprecurrence. On the other hand, the nonresponders might have been from the scenario 3 group with no immune memory to be boosted by the vaccine and the prevalence of MDSCs thatfurther prevented immune priming. In future trials, we might\"personalize\" this prophylactic cancer vaccine by pretesting patients for levels of circulating MDSCs. Today, personalized cancer therapy refers most often to the need to sequence the genome of each individual's tumor.Knowing each person's history of exposure to infectious agents and acute in flammatory events, combined with serum assays of antibody repertoire for well-de ned antigens, will give important information about the person's risk for cancer andability for immune control of cancer progression, as well asresponse to immunopreventive or immunotherapeuticinterventions. For prophylactic cancer vaccines speci cally, choosing anti- gens that the immune system targets on cancer (and likely onother affected tissues) would improve the likelihood of having successful and safe vaccines. For now, prophylactic vaccines should be delegated to boosting or priming the immuneresponse that is ghting premalignant lesions from recurring and progressing to cancer. In the future, we might hope tovaccinate the general population against a collection of abnor-mal self/tumor antigens early in life to generate protective immune memory, especially because our exposure to patho- gens and many childhood illnesses, at least in the developedcountries, is diminishing, leading to a decreased protectiveimmune memory.
