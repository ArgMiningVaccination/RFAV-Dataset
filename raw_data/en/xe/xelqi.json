About This Topic A wide variety of popular complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies can be found and are accepted across the globe today. Since the United States (U.S) Congress created the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), studies to evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and use of CAM therapies have been published in dozens of medical journals and in the U.S. NIH's PubMed listing, indicating the up to 1500 published studies annually being cited in the PubMed listing. Because of its prevalence and the resurgence of demand for new and age-old therapies, it is critical to understand CAM use during the COVID-19 pandemic (Paudyal et al., 2022). The rise of the COVID-SARS-19 disrupted many nation's economies and their respective health care systems. As people have witnessed and endured the scourge of this pandemic, new doubts have arisen about Western medicine and science, as conventional health care systems across the world are imploding. Even in the U.S., local health systems were unable to address the onslaught of victims of the coronavirus and are being forced to make huge changes. As a global community, people are searching for greater hope and wanting to find what among CAM modalities possibly can alleviate symptoms, prevent, and treat COVID-19 and other ailments where Western medicine has demonstrated incomplete effectiveness. It is interesting to see the resurrection of what most people on the globe must actually rely upon due to its high costs, with little access and availability to Western medicine. For years, diverse communities around the world have used CAM to prevent and treat acute and chronic illnesses. Their preferences lay in the realm of non-Western medicine, along with Northern nations' citizens, who increasingly choose from the panoply of traditional and newer therapeutic pursuits (Salmon, 1984). The costs of conventional prevention and treatment of COVID-19 stretches beyond the reach of most people in the Southern Hemisphere, and medical costs even burden many Americans. Faced with the vaccine nationalism of the Great Powers, who collectively have failed to collaborate to devise effective global strategies to alleviate the viral spread. Given current geopolitics, governments have not come together for much international collaboration to rid COVID-19 across all nations. Thus, it is imperative now to increase research into CAM for COVID-19. Traditional medicines at this time may be ready to offer therapeutic modalities that may alleviate some suffering, as many newly published studies are suggesting (Salmon, 2022). The WHO has recently established a research center for Traditional Medicine in India to harness the potential of traditional medicines (WHO, 2022). What now appears critically necessary are reconceptualization of \"health\", \"wellness\" \"prevention\" and even \"medicine\" itself. Much needed are greater formal studies of various complementary and alternative modalities, along with social scientists' exploring the dynamics of preferences and performance in the actual use of these therapies by various peoples. As mentioned above in terms of the PubMed's huge listings of ongoing studies, findings among different patient cohorts should consider complementary therapies to substitute for unsafe and ineffective conventional medical interventions within current health care systems. Such a social learning curve across many national health systems needs to be better understood so that new achievements can be made. Clearly COVID has shown that modern medical science and social epidemiological studies must advance more rapidly for disease control. Will the COVID-19 pandemic spur a new era for a reorientation to human health and healing toward a collective quest of health? Let's hope and work for it. This Special Journal issue on Complementary Medicine and Local Public Health Reorganization seeks to explore some of the interstices between conventional health care systems and the resurgence of complementary and alternative medicines. Since the bulk of the human population have come to inhabit cities, it is not clear that our urban centers remain best prepared to address the new social disease onslaughts within new collectivities of population groups. Most regrettably the Southern Hemisphere nations are being left far behind in COVID vaccination distribution, which has become greatly marred by the vaccine nationalism of multinational pharmaceutical companies within the Great Powers, including US, UK, Germany, China, India, that prevent other nations from manufacturing \"knock-off\" vaccines for their citizenry. The unvaccinated across the world pose the added danger of further mutations within various impoverished and malnutritional groups with poor access to medical care. The coronavirus may likely continue to yield new variants while the current vaccines fail to keep up. Are there comprehensive strategies for wellness in populations that can help contain and/or slow the spread of the COVID-19 bedsides diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS, among other endemic scourges? Can new societal undertakings prepare for potential future social epidemics thru zoonotic causations? Understanding social causation is key for future health planning.
