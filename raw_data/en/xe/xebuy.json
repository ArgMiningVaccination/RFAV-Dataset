Healthy environments not only promote basic health in the areas of physical activity, nutrition and slee p, but also prevent sickness and injury by excluding children who have common symptoms of illness, providing the steps needed to administer medication correctly an d providing the sanitary procedures needed in daily routines. Implementing these requirements helps children to develop trust in their environment and promotes learning and developm ent in all areas. Resources for health issues in child care: The document, Health and Safety Resources for Child Care , with health and safety contact information and websites, is in th e Resource Section at the end of Chapter 1.

SECTION 1: HEALTH RECORDS Requirement for Child's Health Assessment NC General Statute 110- 91(1) & Child Care Rule .1721(a)(1) Each child must have a health assessment before being admitted, or within 30 days following admission to a child care facility. The assessment must be completed and signed by one of the following: a licensed physician the physician's authorized agent who is currently approved by the North Carolina Medical Board, or comparable certifying boa rd in any state contiguous to North Carolina a certified nurse practitioner a public health nurse meeting the Depart ment's Standards for Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment Program Each child must have on file a Children's Medical Report form or a form with the same information provided by the physician. The health assessment must be completed before being admitted or within 30 days of the child's start date in the program. The top portion of the sample form should be completed by the child's parent or guardian. A health care professional should complete the bottom portion. Health 3.1 Division of Child Development Family Child Care Home Handbook A health assessment is not required for a child who is and has been in normal health if the ch ild's parent, guardian, or full- time custodian objects in writi ng to a health assessment on religious grounds which conform to the teachings and practice of any recognized church or religious denomination. The written statement must be mainta ined in the child's records. An objection based upon a \"scienti fic\" belief (i.e. a foreign substance or chemical may be harmful) or non-religious personal belief or philosophy (i.e . clean living, fresh air, pure water) is not considered to be a religious exemption and is not allowed under North Carolina law. A health assessment is not required for school age children. However, the operator must have a copy of the school-age child's immunization record on file. Review health assessment info rmation carefully to see if there is health care information su ch as allergies, special diets, prior medical history, asthma, etc. that you need to be aware of to be able to provide proper care. Additional forms are available in the resource section to assist parents and the operator with outlining an action plan for a child that has a specific chr onic condition that may require emergency medical care. Refer to the following resource sheets: Food Allergy Action Plan Asthma Action Plan Diabetes Action Plan Seizure Action Plan HH Although not required, request parents to update their child's health assessment information annually, after each annual well check visit to a physician, or wh en a child's medical condition changes, such as being diagnosed with an allergy to ensure you have the most up-to-date health information on file. A sample Children's Medical Report form (health assessment) is located in the resource section of Chapter 4- Records and Activities . If you choose to develop your own health assessment form, it must include every item of information found on the sample form. Health 3.2 Division of Child Development Family Child Care Home Handbook Requirement for Immunization Records NC General Statute 110- 91(1) & Child Care Rule .1721(a)(2) Each child must have an up to date record of immunization on file at the FCCH within 30 days of enrollment. A current immunization record showing child is age-appropriat ely immunized must remain on file for each child while in care. Every center must file an immunization report annually with the State Health Department as required by General Statute 130A-155(c). Child care operators must request documentation of immunizations for every child on the first day of attendance.

A form is provided in the resour ce section of this chapter for you to use to document when medi cation is given in error and actions you took to ensure th e health of the child who received the medication. Incident Reports Child Care Rule .1721 (b)(3) An incident report must be completed each ti me a child receives medical treatment by a physician, nurse, physician's assistant, nurse prac titioner, dentist, community clinic, or local health department, as a result of an incident occurring while the child is in the family child care home. The incident must be reported on a form provided by the Division. The report must be signed by the operator and the parent, and maintained in the child's file. A copy of the incident report must be mailed to a representative of the Division within seven calendar days after the incident occurs. This requirement applies when the parent or provider takes the child to the doctor after the incident just to be evaluated, even when the child receives no medical treatment. Some operators choose to complete an incident report any time a child is injured. However, the operator only needs to submit the report to the Division when the child is taken to the doctor to be evaluated. Remember to record incident s on the incident report log. Copies of the Incident Report form are in the resource section of Chapter 4 - Records and Activities . Health 3.6 Division of Child Development Family Child Care Home Handbook Incident Logs Child Care Rule . 1721(b)(4) An incident log must be filled out an y time an incident report is completed. The log is to be cumulative, kept in a separa te file and must be available for review by a representative of the Division. The log must be completed on the form provided by the Division. A copy of the Incident Log is located in the resource Section of Chapter 4- Records and Activities . SECTION 2: INFECTIOUS AND CONTAGIOUS DISEAS ES In FCCHs, children and the caregiver work and play together in close areas, sharing germs. Germs spread quickly and children can infect othe rs before developing symptoms. During the winter months, there is a higher concentration of germs inside b ecause less fresh air circulates the air. Also, children and adults spend more time indoors during the winter months, which increases their exposure to germs. Refer to SECTION 8 - OUTDOOR PLAY to learn more about the benefits of outdoor play. Following san itation procedures such as handwashing and sanitizing, helps reduce the spread of disease causing germs. Check out this resource: Handwashing is the single most effective way to cu t down on the spread of infectious diseases. Proper and consistent handwashing reduces the risk of spreading germs. To access handwashing posters, visit the NC Child Care Heal th and Safety Resource Center at www.healthychildcarenc.org . Infectious and Contagious Disease Control Child Care Rules .1718a(6), .1720(b) You must provide a quiet, separate area for children too sick to remain with other children. You must notify parents immediately if their ch ild becomes too sick to remain in care. You may care for mildly ill ch ildren, but children w ho are too sick must be excluded from your program. Children with any of the following symptoms may not remain in care: Fahrenheit temperature of 100 degrees when taken under the arm or 101 degrees when taken orally. Health 3.7 Division of Child Development Family Child Care Home Handbook Sudden onset of diarrhea ch aracterized by an increased number of bowel movements compared to the child's normal pattern and with increased stool water. Two or more episodes of vomiting within a 12 hour period. Red or pink eye(s) with wh ite or yellow eye discharge. Child may return to care 24 hours after treatment has begun. Scabies or lice. Chicken pox or a rash su ggestive of chicken pox. Tuberculosis. Child may return to care after a health professional states the child is not infectious. Strep throat. A child may return to care 24 hours after treatment has begun. Pertussis or whooping cough. Ch ild may return to care five days after appropriate antibiotic treatment. Hepatitis A virus infection. Ch ild may return to care one week after onset of il lness or jaundice. Impetigo. Child may return to care 24 hours after treatment has begun. If a child is not able to participate in regular activities, regardless of symptoms, the child may not remain in care. When a physician or other health professional issues a written order to separate a child from other children, the child may not remain in care. The quiet, separate area for sick children must be in a place that is easy for you to supervis e. For example, appropriate areas could be a cot or a mat on the other side of the room or near the doorway of the next room. The area must be where you can see and hear the child and respond to them quickly. HH Sometimes children will not have a fever, but they are too sick to remain in child care. For ex ample, a child that is not able to go outside due to an ear inf ection, or is not able to take part in the activities of the whole group because they have a cold, must be excluded from care. HH Prevent the spread of germs in your FCCH by putting mouthed toys in a bin until the toys have been cleaned and sanitized. HH For advice on the exclusion of children from child care due to health issues, please call your local health department, contact the NC Child Care Health and Safety Resource Center at 1-800-367-2229, or use the Communicable Diseases and Exclusion from Child Care chart. Health 3.8 Division of Child Development Family Child Care Home Handbook For a list of illnesses and diseases and how to handle the exclusion of children, see the document, Communicable Diseases and Exclusion from Child Care, in the resource section of this chapter. Conducting daily health checks is an effective way to reduce the spread of infectious di seases. A daily health check includes observing the child for signs of illness and talking with the parent about how the child is feeling. A sample Daily Child Care Health Check form is located in the resource section of this chapter. Six tips for germ control can be found in the article, Maintaining a Sanitary Child Care Environment , in the resource section of this chapter. A document providing guidance on how to prevent the spread of diseases that are transmitted by body fluids, Cleaning Up Body Fluids , is in the resource se ction of this chapter. During flu season, there are occa sions when concerns rise about flu outbreaks. To prepare for the potential effects of a wide spread flu use the guide, Child Care and Preschool Pandemic Influenza Planning Checklist , that can be found at www.pandemicflu.gov/ plan/preschool.htm l. Taking steps now to prepare could prevent potential disruption of your service. A copy of this checkli st is also in Appendix D of theFCCH Handbook. Recognizing Common Symptoms of Illnesses Child Care Rul e .1720(a)(10) You must be able to recognize common symptoms of illnesses. Check with your local CCR&R, Smart Start partnership, community college or local child care association for workshops or classes you might attend on recognizing symptoms of childhood illnesses. A local child care health consultant, medical advisor, or physician is someone you can call to discuss questions regarding unfamiliar medical symptoms a child may be exhibiting. Turn to the local resource sectio n of this handbook and list the contact information for your local child care health consultant, medical advi sor, or physician. Health 3.9 Division of Child Development Family Child Care Home Handbook Emergency Medical Situations Child Care Rule .1720(a)(8) You must have a working telephone w ithin the FCCH. Telephone numbers for the fire department, law enforcement office, emergency medical service and poison control center shall be posted near th e telephone. See the resource section of this chapter for a chart that will help you determine whether or not certain situations require immediate medical attention. See Chapter 4-Records and Activities for a sample Emergency Telephone Numbers chart. See Appendix D of this handbook for Emergency Preparedness Resources. SECTION 3: MEDICATION Though the child care rules do not require y ou to administer medication to children, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA ) requires that programs make reasonable accommodations for children with special needs, including special health care needs. Children with chronic health conditions li ke asthma, diabetes, allergies, sickle cell anemia, or seizure disorders may only be able to attend child ca re if medication can be given on site. For more information on the ADA refer to the handout in the resource s ection titled, \"Commonly Asked Questions Related to Giving Medicine in Child Ca re.\" If your program chooses to administer medication or must administer me dication due to the American w ith Disabilities Act, it is imperative that staff receive tr aining in medication administra tion procedures and that policies are established to reassure parents and staff that the program strives to administer medications safely. In all cases, you must follow the gui delines in the child care requirements. Check out these resources: Contact a local child care health consultant to as sist you in training and policy development. To locate a child care health cons ultant in your area, visit the NC Child Care Health and Safety Resource Center's website at www.healthychildcare.org for a listing of child care health consultants by county or call the Resource Center at 1-800-367-2229.

A record of the authorization must be maintained at your program. No drug or medication shall be administered for non-medical reasons, such as to induce sleep. Willfully administering medication without writt en authorization can result in a Class A1 misdemeanor charge. Willfully administeri ng medication without written authorization that results in serious injury to a chil d can result in a Class F felony charge. It is illegal to intentionally give a child medication without written authorization from the child's parent. It is the parent's responsibility to provide all the documentation and materials required to legally and safely administer medication. A sample Permission to Administer Medication form is in the resource section of Chapter 4 - Records and Activities . Documentation of Medication Administration Child Care Rule .1720(c)(13) Any time you administer prescription or OTC medication to any child in care, the child's name, date, time, amount and type of medication given, and the name and signature of the person administering the medica tion must be documented. You must keep documentation for administer ing medication for at least six months. Written authorization to administer medication must include the child's name, the specific name of the medication, dosage instructions, the beginning and end dates the medication is to be given the child, the parent's signature, and the date the parent signed the authorization form. Health 3.11 Division of Child Development Family Child Care Home Handbook Parents must provide detailed instructions on the dosage of medication and specific times th e medication is to be given. Medication can not be administer ed on an \"as needed\" basis. A sample Permission to Administer Medication form is in the resource section Chapter 4 - Records and Activities . When you document the administration of medication on the Permission to Administer Medication form or on a separate form, you must keep the admini stration of medication record on file during the time period the medication is being administered and for at least six months after the medication is administered. Only one medication can be listed on each Permission to Administer Medication form. Check the expiration dates of the medicine you receive. No expired medications can be given to children. If you have questions con cerning whether medication provided by the parent should be administered, you may decline to give the medicati on without signed, written dosage instructions from a licensed physician or authorized health professional. It is always your option to refuse to administer any medication. This question should be discussed, however, prior to enrollment so that ch ildren who need the medication will get it when needed. No documentation is required for applications of OTC topical ointments, topical teething ointme nt or gel, insect repellents, lotions, creams, and powders. For a copy of the Steps to Administering Medication poster go to the NC Child Care Health and Safety Resource Center website www.healthychildcarenc.org . A Checklist for Admini stering Medication is located in the resource section of this chapter. HH Parents should be informed any time an error or mishap occurs when administering me dication. For example, if a caregiver fails to give medication at the authorized time, the parent should be notified. Missing a dose or receiving a delayed dose of medication could affect the usefulness of the medication or when the next dosage should be administered. Document the error and mishap and inform the parent immediately. A sample Medication Error Report is available in the resource section of this chapter. Health 3.12 Division of Child Development Family Child Care Home Handbook Prescribed Medications Child Care Rules .1720(c) (2)(B-C), (3), (12-13) Prescribed medication must be stor ed in its original container. Prescribed medications can onl y be given to the person for whom they are prescribed. Any medication remaining after the course of treatment is completed or after authorization is withdrawn must be returned to the child's parents. Any medication the parent fails to retrieve within 72 hours of completion of treatment must be discarded. Prescribed medication must be in the original container that bears the pharmacist's label a nd includes the following: Child's name; Date the prescription was filled; The name of the prescribi ng physician or other health professional; The amount and frequency of dosage; and The name of the medication or the prescription number. If a parent brings a pharmaceutical sample, the medication must be accompanied by dated written instructions from a physician or other health professional specifying: the child's name, the name of the medication, the amount and frequency of dosage, and the signature of the pr escribing physician or other health professional. Authorization to administer prescription medication is only valid for the course of treatment. Only one medication should be listed on each authorization form. If there are no dosage directions on a label, the medicine can be accompanied by written instructions for dosage, which includes the child's name a nd is dated and signed by the prescribing physician or other health professional. HH Ask parents to see if the ch ild's physician will prescribe medications that only require one or two doses per day which would reduce or eliminate the need for you to administer medication. Health 3.13 Division of Child Development Family Child Care Home Handbook Over-The-Counter (OTC) Medications Child Care Rules .1720(c)(4),(5),(12) OTC medications may only be given as authoriz ed in writing by the child's parent, not to exceed the amounts and frequency of dosage specified on the label. The parent's authorization include the child's name, th e specific name of the OTC medicine, the amount and frequency of the dos ages, the signature of the parent, physician or other health care professiona l, and the date the instructi ons were signed by the parent, physician or other health professional.

Medication cannot be administ ered \"as needed.\" Specific instructions on when to admini ster medication must be given, providing symptoms that indicate a need for medication. Caregivers can only give the recommended dosage stated on the package instructions. If a physician prescribes a larger dosage than specified on the pack age, the parent must bring in written, signed and dated instructions from the physician. HH The Food and Drug Administration issued a public health advisory in January 2008 stat ing that children younger than two-years-old should not be given cold medications because of serious and life-threateni ng side effects. The AAP has Health 3.14 Division of Child Development Family Child Care Home Handbook taken the position that ove r-the counter cough and cold medicines do not work for children younger than six and in some cases may pose a health risk. Visit www.fda.gov for more information. In the event cold medicine or any other over the counter medication does not indicate on the label the dose for the age of the child who is receiving the medication, the parents must provide instructions on a form signed by a physician or other health care professional. The instructions should specify: the child's name the name of the medication the amount and frequency of the dosage the date the instructions we re signed by the physician or other health care professional HH When children are taking these types of medication they may have some of their symptoms eliminated but may still need to be excluded from child care if th ey are not able to participate in all daily activities. See the Resource Section of Chapter 4 - Records and Activities for a sample Permission to Administer Medication form . Blanket Permission to Administer Certain Medications Child Care Rules .1720(c)(6-9) A written statement from a parent may give blanket permission for up to six months to authorize administration of OT C or prescription medication fo r chronic medical conditions and allergic reactions. A written statement from a parent may give blanket permission for up to one year to authorize administration of OTC topical ointments, topical teething ointment or gel, insect repellants, lotions, creams, and powders, such as sunscreen, diapering creams, baby lotion, and baby powder. A written statement from a parent may provide blanket permission to administer a one- time, weight appropriate dose of acetaminophen to a child in cases where the child has a fever and the parent cannot be contacted. This should only be used in case of emergency. A parent can give you standing authorization to administer OTC medi cation as directed by the State Health Director, when there is a publ ic health emergency as identified by the State Health Director. Parents who have children w ith known medical conditions with potential emergency symp toms should inform providers and substitutes. A six month blanket statement should be completed providing clear inst ructions on a provider's Health 3.15 Division of Child Development Family Child Care Home Handbook response to an emergency and a detailed explanation of how and when medication is administered. Some medical conditions that would warrant a six month blanket statement in a child ca re setting include, but are not limited to: asthma, diabetes, sickle cell anemia, epilepsy and allergies. If you have a child in your program with allergies who requires an Epipen, an Epipe n, Jr., or a Twinject ask the parent to provide you with a trainer Epipen or a trainer Twinject. You are able to practice the injections without needles. The written twelve month statement must describe the specific conditions under which the ointments and creams are to be administered and detail ed instructions on how, where and when they are to be ad ministered. Parents may not indicate \"as needed\" on th e authorization form. Each time acetaminophen is administered in the event of an emergency when the parent can not be reached, a new blanket permission to admini ster medication must be completed for the next emergency. When a parent gives standing authorization to administer OTC medicine as directed by th e NC State Health Director, the authorization must be in wr iting and is valid for as long as the child is enrolled. Documentation must contain the child's name, signature of the parent, the date the authorization was signed by the pa rent, and the date that the authorization ends or a statem ent that the authorization is valid until withdrawn by the parent in writing. This would typically occur in the event of a public health emergency as identified by the State Health Director. For example, if a provider lives close to a nuclear power plant, they receive potassium iodide tablets to administer if an emergency occurs. Each time medications are administered by a provider whether for a chronic condition or not, a record must be kept on either the Permission to Administer Medication form or a form developed by the provider which includes the child's name, the date, time, amount and type of medication given and the name and signature of the person administering the medication. The caregiver may decline to administer questionable medication without signed writte n dosage instructions from a licensed physician or authorized health professional. Health 3.16 Division of Child Development Family Child Care Home Handbook Sample blanket Permission to Administer Topical Ointment/Lotion/Powder and Permission to Administer Medication for Chronic Medical Conditions and Allergic Reactions forms can be found in the resource section of Chapter 4 - Records and Activities. Additional forms are available in the resource section to assist parents and staff with outlining an action plan for a child that has a specific chronic conditi on that may require emergency medical care.

Administering Medication In An Emergency Situation Child Care Rule .1720(c)(10) Medication can be administered to a child without parental aut horization in th e event of an emergency medical condition when the child's parent is unavailable, provided that the medication is administered with the authorizat ion and in accordance with instructions from a medical professional. If you administer medication in an emergency situation, you must document the contact information from the medical professional that you spoke with, instructions th at were given for administering the medicati on, child's name, date, time and amount and name of medication given. Health 3.17 Division of Child Development Family Child Care Home Handbook SECTION 4: NUTRITION Research shows that there are crucial relationshi ps between nutrition and health, and health and learning. Mealtimes not only promote physical and mental development, th ey also are a time to enhance children's social skills. Children are beginning to hear about good manners and participate in the conversation at the table, whether it be by smili ng in response to a caregiver's interaction or peer to peer inte raction of preschoolers. Opportunities are also given to develop self-help skills by washing hands before and afte r meals, helping to set the table, serving themselves, using child-sized utensils, and cleari ng their place. The purpose of these requirements is to establish the minimum nutritional requirements for children in child care. Meal Patterns Child Care Rule .1718(a)(1) All meals and snacks must comply with the Meal Patterns for Children in Child Care. The types of food and number and size of serv ings must be appropriate for the ages and developmental levels of the children in care . The Meal Patterns for Child ren in Child Care is based on the recommended nutrient intake for children. The National Research Council bases these recommendations on what is adequate for maintaining good nutrition for children. If children bring food from home for their meals or snacks, or if food is catered, you are respons ible for making sure it is nutritional and meets the Meal Patterns for Children in Child Care. If it does not, you must have additional food available to supplement the me als and snacks brought from home. You should share nutri tional information and meal ideas with parents to ensure they provide a well-balanced meal for their children. A copy of the chart, Meal Patterns for Children in Child Care Programs, can be found in the resource section of this chapter. Non-nutritional food should onl y be served on special occasions. Non-nutritional foods include su ch items as potato chips, popcorn, candy, cakes, and some cookies. Special occasions include birt hdays, holidays, activities used to enhance learning, or other similar events. Juices that are served must be 100% fruit juice. There are three different types of meal s that can be served to children. Health 3.18 Division of Child Development Family Child Care Home Handbook breakfast must include at least three different food groups, snacks must include at least two different food groups, and lunch/dinner must include at least four different food groups. It is required that milk be served when you provide breakfast, lunch or dinner. HH Making the menu available to parents by posting in a prominent area helps inform parents about proper nutrition. Get as much information as possible from the child's parent regarding the child's food alle rgies and/or special diet. Special diet would include dietary requirements due to allergies or other medical issu es, or could be for religious reasons. It does not include parental preferences. HH Children's food allergies should be posted. Some food allergies may cause serious, even life threatening reactions. You should know what to look for if a child has an allergic reaction and what measures should be taken in case of accidental exposure. The web site, http://www.f oodallergy.org, for the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Netw ork, provides information and resources about the management of food allergie s and the use of epinephrine (Epi Pen Jr.).

For more information about this program call 919-707-5799 or go to www.nutritionnc.com/snp/cacfp.htm Nutritional Requirements Child Care Rules .1718(a)(2-3) No child shall go more than four hours w ithout a meal or snack being provided. Drinking water must be freely availabl e to children and offered frequently. Only pasteurized milk, milk products or fruit juices may be used. Water should be offered to children more frequently in hot weather and after and during vigorous play. Remember infants, toddlers and young children may not be able to verbalize their need s. Children who cannot drink without help must be offere d water regularly throughout the day. HH Create ways to make water more accessible to children. Provide a water cooler in the indoor/outdoor area with paper cups, have a pitcher in the re frigerator that can be used indoors or taken outdoors, or have a child sized plastic pitcher that could be placed on a low table in the room. Health 3.20 Division of Child Development Family Child Care Home Handbook Infant Feeding Child Care Rules .1718(c),(d) You must hold infants for bottle-feeding until th ey are able to hold their own bottles. The bottles must never be propped. Each child shall be held or placed in feeding chairs or other age-appropriate seating apparatus to be fed. Any child less than 15 months of age must have an individual written feeding schedule that is provided by the parent or the child's health care provider. Any infant formula must be prepared according to the instructions on the formula package or label, or according to written instruc tions from the child's health care provider. An infant must never be laid down with a bottle. HH Laying infants down with bottles can cause them to choke or aspirate the contents of the bottl e. This may also contribute to long-term health issues such as ear infections, bottle mouth disease, orthodontic problems and speech disorders. An infant who is able to hold his or her own bottle and older children who can feed themselves may be placed in a high chair, booster seat, or at a child -size table with sturdy chairs or other age-appropria te seat while eating. HH A child's feet should be firmly on the floor or on a footrest to provide support for the upper body and their elbows should be able to rest comfortably on the table. Children may not walk around or sit on the floor while eating. The Infant Feeding Schedule must include the child's name, the date the schedule was made, amounts of food/breastmilk/formula, time intervals for feeding, parent or health care provider's signature, a nd the child's date of birth. Whenever you have questions abou t the type or quantity of food that the parent listed on the Infant Feeding Schedule, check with the parent and/or an outside professional such as a health consultant, nutritionist or pediatrician for answers to your questions. The Infant Feeding Schedule should be updated in consultation with the child's parent and/or health care provider, to reflect changes in the child's needs as he or she develops. Ask the parent to in itial changes you have noted on the schedule from verbal requests. A sample Infant Feeding Schedule can be found in Chapter 4 - Records and Activities . Health 3.21 Division of Child Development Family Child Care Home Handbook HH Microwaves should not be used to warm baby bottles. If you choose to warm baby bottles, warm them under warm running tap water. Can you suggest some examples of appropriate feeding devices? High chair feeding table child-s ize table and chairs Breastfeeding Child Care Rule .1702(c)(9) Accommodations for breastfeeding mothers ar e provided that include seating and an electrical outlet in a place othe r than the bathroom, that is sh ielded from view by staff and public, which may be used by mothers while they are breastfeeding or expressing milk. Breastfeeding is the recommended feeding practice for infants, at least birth to 12 months and older, if mutually wanted by mother and infant. Encourage mothers to continue breastfeeding and provide breastmilk for their infant while in child care. Importance of Breastfeeding: Breastfeeding supports optimal growth and development of infants. It decreases the possibility that babies will get a variety of infectious diseases, ear inf ections, diarrhea, and some forms of cancer. Breastfed infants have a lower incidence of sudden infant death syndrome. Breastfed infants have a lo wer risk of obesity in childhood and in adolescence. A comfortable chair and an elec trical outlet must be provided to mothers while they breastfeed or express milk. It should be shielded from the view of additional caregivers and other parents that may be present. HH If space prevents you from providing a separate room for a breastfeeding mother, yo u may want to purchase a screen that can be set up in your primary space. Two resources on breastfeeding can be found at the end of this chapter, including How to Handle Pumped Milk and 10 Health 3.22 Division of Child Development Family Child Care Home Handbook Ways Child Care Directors, Teachers, and Staff Can Support Breastfeeding . Contact your local Breastfeed ing Coordinator or Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) coor dinator at the local health department to get up-to-date information on breastfeeding practices, how you can support br eastfeeding, and potential grants supporting breastfeedi ng in child care programs. For information on how to support breastfeeding in your Family Child Care Home, visi t the NC Nutrition Services Branch website for information on promoting and supporting breastfeeding http://nutritionnc.com/breastf eeding/breastfeeding-hom e.htm Labeling Baby Bottles Child Care Rule .1720(d)(7) You must date and label all bottles for each individual child when storing them in the refrigerator. If you only have one child that is using a bottle then you are not required to label the bottle. Meaningful Meal Times HH Making the transition from playi ng to eating can be hard for some children. If children are over-stimulated from play, they may not feel like eating. Try to plan an activity that will relax the children and help them settle down before mealtime. Washing hands will also help ease the transition. HH Have the meal ready to serve before calling children to the table or placing them in high chairs. When children are required to wait they often become restless and bored. Plan ahead to minimize wait time. HH You can provide a positive exam ple to children by eating the same foods they are and by discussing the foods being eaten, as part of nutrition education for children. HH See mealtimes as an opportunity for interaction. Eat with the children in your care. HH Activities such as reading books about farming and where different foods come from, or growing your own vegetable gardens with the children, will encourage the children to try foods that are new to them. Health 3.23 Division of Child Development Family Child Care Home Handbook HH Cooking/science activities are opportunities to promote good nutrition. Choose activities that include nutritious foods, i.e., making a fruit salad. HH Mealtime is important to a ch ild's development. The food they eat gives them the vitamins and nutrients needed to grow and stay healthy. SECTION 5: FOOD SERVICE The Division of Child Development does not requir e a sanitation inspection of Family Child Care Homes by the NC Department of Environment and Natural Resources. However, Child Care consultants monitor sanitary conditions as a par t of their annual compli ance visit as well as on any other visit that may occu r in the course of the year . Sanitary Procedures Child Care Rule .1720(d)(4) You must follow sanitary procedures when preparing and serving food to children. All food must be served in a sanitary manner to minimize the possibility of spreading germs. Meals and snacks must be served on plates, napkins/paper towels or in containers appropriate for the age of the child. No food or snacks may be served directly on tabletops. You must wash your hands be fore and after handling food and feeding the children. You must be sure that children's hands are washed before and after each child is fed. Children may not share bottles, plates, forks, spoons, cups, glasses or portions of food. Children must receive individual portions of food. For example: Two children cannot share one drink with two straws or one bowl of pudding with two spoons. HH The following steps for hand washing should be followed to ensure sanitary food preparation: 1. Wet hands with warm water, no less than 80 Farenheit and no more than 110 Fahrenheit. 2. Apply liquid soap to hands. 3. Rub hands together vigorously for at least 15 seconds. Rub areas between fingers, around nail beds, under fingernails, jewelry and back of hands. Health 3.24 Division of Child Development Family Child Care Home Handbook 4. Rinse hands under running water until they are free of soap and dirt. Leave the water running while drying your hands. 5. Dry hands with clean disposable paper towel or single use cloth towel. 6. Turn off the faucet with a disposable paper towel or single use cloth towel. Put disposable paper towel in covered trash container lined with a disposable plastic bag. Put single use cloth to wel in the laundry hamper. HH Although you are not required to sanitize the table before and after eating, this pr actice is highly recomm ended. It reduces the spread of communicable diseases. Handwashing posters can be found on the NC Child Care Health and Safety Resource Center web site, www.healthychildcarenc.org, under the publications and resources tab. You may want to place this poster in the hand- washing areas. Refrigerate All Perishable Food and Beverages Child Care Rule .1720(d)(6) You must refrigerate all perishable food and beverages. The refrigerator must be in good repair and maintain a temperature of 45 degrees Fahrenheit or below. A refrigerator thermometer is required to monitor the temperature. Food left over in serving dish es or cooking containers does not need to be discarded if it has been maintained at the appropriate temperature and pr otected from contaminates. SECTION 6: DIAPERING/TOILETING Sanitary Toilet, Diaper Changi ng & Hand Washing Facilities Child Care Rule .1720(d)(2) You must have sanitary toilet, diaper changing and hand washing facilities. Diaper changing areas must be separate from food preparation areas. Diapers should be changed on an easy to clean surface such as diaper changing table or vi nyl or plastic changing pad. Health 3.25 Division of Child Development Family Child Care Home Handbook Any areas covered with or made of cloth, such as a towel, furniture, or carpet, may not be used as a surface for diapering. Bacteria may grow on feces left on these mater HH If you or the children use the same sink for both diapering and for food preparation, it is best practice to sanitize the sink by spraying the sink and faucets with a bleach solution after each diapering/toileting. Sanitary Diapering Procedures Child Care Rule .1720(d)(3) You must follow sanitary diapering procedures. Diapers should be changed whenever they become soiled or wet. You must regularly check childre n's diapers to see if they have become soiled or wet. If diapers are not regularly changed a child can develop a rash or infection. HH To minimize the spread of germs the following diapering procedures are recommended when changing diapers or helping to toilet children: 1. Get organized. Before bringi ng the child to the diaper changing area, wash your hands, gather and bring the supplies that you need to the diaper changing table (i.e., clean diaper, diaper cream, moistened wipes for cleaning the child, disposable gloves, a receptacle for the disposal of the dirty diap er, clean clothes if needed, and sanitizing solution for the diapering surface). 2. Put on disposable gloves. 3. Bring the child to the diaper changing area. Keep soiled clothing away from you and away from any surfaces you cannot easily cl ean and sanitize after the change. 4. Clean the child's diaper area. Remove stool and urine from front to back by using a fresh wipe or wet paper towel each time. 5. Remove the soiled diaper without contaminating any surface not already in contact wi th stool or urine. Fold the soiled surface of the di aper inward. Put soiled disposable diapers, liner, soiled towelettes, then gloves in a covered, plastic-lined, hands-free covered receptacle. If reusable cl oth diapers are used, put the soiled cloth diaper and its contents (without emptying or rinsing) in a plastic bag or into a plastic-lined, hands- free covered can to give to parents or laundry service. Health 3.26 Division of Child Development Family Child Care Home Handbook Wipe your hands with a disposable wipe. Wipe the child's hands with a fr esh disposable wipe. 6. Put on a clean diaper and dress the child. 7. Wash the child's hands for a minimum of 15 seconds and return the child to a supervised area. 8. Clean and sanitize the diaper changing surface. Clean any visible soil from the changing surface with detergent and water; rinse with water. Wet the entire changing surface with the sa nitizing solution (spray a sanitizing bleach solution of \u00bc cup of household liquid chlorine bleach in one gallon of tap water, mixed fresh daily). Put away the spray bottle of sanitizer. If the recommended bleach dilute is sprayed on the surface, leave in contact with the su rface for at least 2 minutes. The surface can be left to ai r dry or can be wiped dry after 2 minutes of contact with the bleach solution. 9. Wash your hands. Diaper procedure posters can be found on the NC Child Care Health and Safety Resource Center web site, www.healthychildcarenc.org, under the publications and resources tab. You may want to place this poster in the diaper changing area. HH It is best practice to use disposable gloves when changing diapers. If you use disposable gloves: Put them on after gathering your supplies and before bringing the child to the changing table. Remove gloves after disposing of soiled diaper. Dispose of the gloves. Clean your hands with a di sposable wipe. Clean the child's hands with a fr esh disposable wipe. Follow steps 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the diapering procedure above. Always wash your hands betw een diapering and toileting children. HH To reduce the possibility of spreading germs , it is best practice to use disposable gl oves if you have a cut or open wound on your hand. HH A fun way to remember if you have washed your hands and the children's hands long enough is to wash your hands until you have finished singing a song such as \"Row, Row, Row Your Boat\" or \"Happy Birthday\" (or a song of similar length, fifteen seconds long). HH Be cautious when changing diapers on an elevated surface. 1. Never leave a child unattended. 2. Always have supplies readily accessible to you. Health 3.27 Division of Child Development Family Child Care Home Handbook 3. Position yourself so the child cannot roll or wiggle off the changing table. 4. Use a changing table or pad that has upward curved edges. 5. If an emergency arises, you should place the child on the floor or take the child with you. SECTION 7: SLEEP Daily Rest Time NC General Stat ute 110-91(2) You must provide daily re st time for each child. Rest time should be provided according to the needs of the child. Children do not have to sleep during rest time. You must provide some type of quiet activity if children are not able to sleep. Sleeping Space NC General Statute 110-91(6) & Child Care Rules . 1718(a)(5); .1724(a)(2),(4) Space shall be available for prope r storage of beds, cribs, mats, cots, sleeping garments and linens. Each child shall have their own individual sleeping space and linens. Infants 12 months and younger must be placed in a crib, bassinet or play pen with a firm padded surface when sleeping. Children's faces must not be covered while they sleep. Examples of adequate sleep ing space include bed, crib, play pen, cot, mat or sleeping bag with individual linens. Children must be ab le to rest comfortably. If beds are used, only one ch ild can be placed on each. Linens must be changed weekly or whenever they become soiled or wet and cannot be shared between children. Infants and toddlers should be able to rest or sleep when they are tired. Infants and toddlers often rest by playing quietly or just lying down and gazing. Sleep requires a safe place away from noise, movement and stimulation. Health 3.28 Division of Child Development Family Child Care Home Handbook HH It is recommended, that children sleep at least 18 inches apart, to decrease the spread of germs. HH It is best practice to not use a sofa/couch for a sleeping arrangement due to sanitation and the potential of children getting hurt should they roll off. HH When setting up the environment, consider the ages of the infants and other children in care. Are you going to serve children of about the sa me age or children of mixed ages. Consider how you will alter the environment to protect younger infants from the older infants and children who are mobile. HH If you have children who have difficulty going to sleep, some suggestions for helping them relax include reading books, playing soft music, closing th e blinds, or having them lie down with their \"special toy\" or blanket. There should be enough light to supervise the children. HH Cribs and play pens used for sleeping must be easily cleanable, and equipped with a firm, tight-fitting mattress made of waterproof, washable material at least 2 inches thick. HH A large vinyl-covered mat on the floor can provide a place where infants and toddlers can move about safely. Children who stay in a crib or a play pen for extended periods of time will not experience the social, emotional, physical or intellectual stimulation, so impor tant to their development. HH There should be ample floor sp ace for crawling, creeping, and toddling. Supervision During Sleep Child Care Rule .1718 (a)(7)(B) For children who are sleeping or napping, the st aff are not required to visually supervise them, but must be able to hear and respond quickly to them. Children must not sleep or nap in a room with a closed door between the children and the supervising staff. The staff must be on the same level of th e home where children are sleeping or napping. Electronic monitors cannot be used as the way to hear Children cannot sleep in rooms with the door closed if you are in another room. Children may be placed in bedrooms that are on ground level as long as you can hear them and respond to them quickly. This means that your own children must sleep on the ground level except for overnight Health 3.29 Division of Child Development Family Child Care Home Handbook care. When providing overnight care, your children may sleep in their own rooms, even if those rooms are not on ground level. You may not be outdoors a nd leave sleeping children indoors. Infant Sleep Position General Statute 110-91(15) & Child Care Rule .1724(a)(1),(4) Infants must be placed on their backs to sleep unless there is a written waiver that specifies another sleep position. Nothing may be placed over the head or face of an infant aged 12 months or younger when the infant is laid down to sleep. You are required to place infants 12 months and younger to sleep on their backs unless there is a written waiver from a health care professional speci fying a different position. A health care professional is a physician licensed to practice in North Carolina, a nurse prac titioner approved to practice in North Carolina, or a licens ed physician assistant. A waiver from a parent for a different sleep position is allowed once the infant is at least six months old. You must develop safe sleep policies and review the policy with parents before the child en rolls, and parents need to sign a statement that they reviewed the safe sleep policies. You can find detailed informati on on what to include in your safe sleep policy in Chapter 2 - Safety . You must visually check infants at designated intervals. You will note the intervals in your safe sleep policy. The visual checks can be documented on the sample Visual Check forms found in Chapter 4 - Records and Activities . If a baby rolls over into anothe r position after you place the child on their back, the Ameri can Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend that you reposition the child on his or her back. HH Parents are often concerned that putting a baby on their back to sleep will cause a flat s pot on the back of the head. Changing a baby's position thr oughout the day as well as ensuring plenty of tummy play time will minimize flatness. Tummy time also helps the child work on strengthening the neck muscles.

Overnight Care Requirements Child Care Rule .1701(h) If you are licensed to provide overnight care, you may sleep during nighttime hours provided: The operator and the children in care, ex cluding the operator's own children, are on ground level. All children are asleep. You and all child care children ar e on the ground level of the home. You can hear and respond to the children quickly. A smoke detector wired into the electrical system with a battery back up, or two smoke detectors, one wired into the electrical system with another one that is battery operated is located in each room where children are sleeping. If you are licensed for overnigh t care, it will be indicated on your license as third shift care. Your own children may sleep in an upstairs room during overnight hours. During the day, your preschool children must nap in the same area used by the children enrolled in child care. SECTION 8: OUTDOOR PLAY Recent attention has been given to the increasi ng number of children who are overweight or obese and the health issues that result. Th e American Academy of Pediatrics recommends increasing the amount of time spent in outdoor pl ay because children are more physically active when they play outdoors. The Center for Diseas e Control and the National Association for Sports and Physical Education recommends at least 60 minutes of physical activity daily. Health 3.31 Division of Child Development Family Child Care Home Handbook Caregivers are in a unique position to utiliz e the outdoor environmen t to promote not only physical development but all types of development and learning. The outdoor learning environment offers a sense of freedom for childre n. Children are able to play freely with peers, expand their imagination and investigations beyond th e restraints of indoor activities, release energy and explore their sense of to uch, smell, taste and sense of motion. The purpose of these requirements is to guarantee that all childre n in child care are given the opportunity to play outd oors on a daily basis. Outdoor Play NC General Statute 110-91(2) & Child Care Rules .1718(4), (10)(D-E) Developmentally appropriate equipment and ma terials shall be provided for a variety of outdoor activities which allow for vigorous play , large and small muscle development, and social, emotional, and intellectual development. The operator must provide space and time for vigorous indoor activities when children cannot play outdoors. The written schedule must include a minimu m of one hour of outdoor play throughout the day, if weather conditions permit. The written schedule must include a daily gross motor activity which may occur indoors or outdoors. All children, including infa nts, toddlers, and school age-children must be take n outdoors daily, if weather conditions permit. Children who are too sick to go outdoors and/or are not able to participate in all daily activities, which include outdoor act ivities, should be excluded from care until they are well e nough to participate in all parts of the program. HH Taking children outside pr ovides many benefits, such as fresh air, an environment more free of germ containment; physical fitne ss; stress reduction for you and children; and natural opportunities for active physical play. \"Weather conditions permit\" means: Temperatures that fall within the guidelines developed by the Iowa Department of Public Health and specified on the Weather Watch chart. These gui delines must be used when determining appropriate w eather conditions for taking children outside for outdoor learning activities and playtime. This chart may be downloaded free of charge from: Health 3.32 Division of Child Development Family Child Care Home Handbook http://www.idph.state.ia.us/h cci/common/pdf/weatherwatch .pdf. Healthy air quality as forecast by the Department of Environment and Natural Res ouces' Air Quality Forecasts and Information web page. No active precipitation. A copy of the chart, Child Care Weather Watch, can be found in the Resource Section of this chapter. HH Caregivers would be expected to shorten outside time on days that are very cold/v ery hot or not go outside at all. They should bring children inside if the children are uncomfortable. HH Playing in gentle rain or snow is a learning experience and can be both educational and f un for children. Ask parents to bring weather appropriate clothe s such as rain boots, coat, gloves, and hats. Consult the Air Quality Index (AQI) for information about air quality and amount of time children can play outside. The AQI uses a color-coded system to indicate when air quality may be a health risk. For a color coded Air Quality Index guide and more information on ozone levels in your area, go to the web site for the Division of Air Quality, http://xapps.enr.state.nc.us/aq/ForecastCenter. You can also check your local news, listen to the radio or call 1- 888-RU4NCAIR. See the resource section of this chapter for a color coded Air Quality Index Guide. HH The schedule may need to be changed to allow children to go outdoors at the most appropriate time of the day. For example, in the heat of the summer taking children outside earlier when it is cooler or waiting until the afternoon in the wint er when it is warmer. See Chapter 2 - Safety for information and rules for outdoor play equipment.

SECTION 9: INDOOR AIR QUALITY Smoke Free Program Child Care Rule . 1720 (f) The operator must not use tobacco products at any time while children are in care. Tobacco products may not be used indoors while children are in care or in a vehicle wh en transporting children. Health 3.34 Division of Child Development Family Child Care Home Handbook Health 3.35 SECTION 10: SCREEN TIME Television exposure is associated with obesi ty, language delay, inactivity, aggression, and decreased attention spans. Children experience these negatives effects as well as miss out on important opportunities for social ization with peers and interacti ons with teachers when exposed to television viewing. The total amount of screen time a child experiences in a day nearly doubles if a Family Child Care Home caregiver exposes children to television. The American Academy of Pediatrics discourages television viewing in the first 2 years of life and recommends a daily limit of 1 to 2 hours of quality programming for older childre n. Rules are now in place to limit the amount of screen time . Screen Time Child Care Rule .1718 (11) When screen time, including videos, video games, and computer usage, is provided, it shall be: a) Offered only as a free choice activity, b) Used to meet a developmental goal, and c) Limited to no more than two and a half hours per week for each child two years of age and older. Usage time periods may be extended for special events, projects, occasions such as a current event, homework, on-site computer cla sses, holiday, and birthday celebration. Screen time is prohibited for child ren under the age of two years. The operator must offer alternative activities for children under th e age of two years. When multiple ages are in a room, make sure alternative activities are provided for childr en under two. Try to re-direct the toddlers to those activities when they go towards the television. If attempts have been made to interest the toddlers in other activities, especially by engaging in those other activities with them, and they still go to the television or computer with the other children, then you would be in compliance with the rule. HH Refer to the resource section for Issue Brief 2 - Best Practices for Nutrition, Physical Activity & Screen Media Time in Child Care Settings. It provides practical nutrition, physical activity and screen media time recommendations for the child care environment.

Cleaning Up Body Fluids Treat urine, stool, vomit, blood and all body fluids as potentially infectious. Spills of body fluid should be cleaned up and surfaces sanitized with a strong sanitizing or disinfecting solution (1 tablespoon of bleach to 1 quart of water, 500-800 ppm of chlorine). Alternative sanitizing solutions must be approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and their Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) must be kept on file . For small amounts of urine and stool on smooth surfaces 1. Wipe off and clean away visible soil with a detergent solution. 2. Rinse the surface with clean water. 3. Apply disinfecting solution to the surface. 4. Let it air dry. Follow the directions for EPA approved disinfectants. For larger spills on floors, or any spills on rugs or carpets 1. Wear gloves while cleaning. Wear disposable gloves when cleaning a spill that may contain blood. Use either disposable gloves or household gloves for other body fluids. 2. Avoid splashing any contaminated material onto the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose or mouth, or into any open sores. Smooth surfaces and floors Carpets, rugs, and surfaces covered with fabric 3. Wipe up as much visible material as possible with disposable paper towels. Place soiled paper towels and other soiled disposable material in a leak-proof, plastic bag. Securely tie or seal the bag. 3. Vacuum carpets, rugs or surfaces covered with fabric with a wet/dry vacuum, if available, OR blot the area to remove body fluids as quickly as possible. 4. Clean the spill area with a detergent or a disinfectant- detergent. 4. Spot clean the area with a detergent- disinfectant (not bleach solution). Shampooing or steam cleaning the area may be necessary. 5. Rinse the area with clean water. 5. Do not rinse the area. 6. Disinfect surface by wetting the affected area with a strong bleach solution (500-800 ppm) OR use industrial disinfectant, following manufacturer's direction. 6. When cleaned with a detergent-disinfectant, disinfecting happens by applying and extracting the solution until there is no visible soil. Follow the manufacture's directions for product use. 7. Dry the surface. 8. Clean with detergent, rinse, and disinfect reusable household gloves . Remove, dry and store these gloves away from food or food surfaces. OR Discard disposable gloves in a plastic bag . Securely tie or seal the plastic bag. 9. Clean with detergent, rinse and disinfect all mops and other equipment used to clean up the spill.

To prepare for such situations: 1) Know how to access Emergency Medical Services (EMS) in your area. 2) Educate staff on the recognition of an emergency. 3) Know the phone number for each child's guardian and primary health care provider. 4) Develop plans for children with special medical needs with their family and physician. At anytime, if you believe the child's life may be at risk, or you believe there is a risk of permanent injury, seek immediate medical treatment . Call Emergency Medical Services (EMS) immediately if: You believe the child's life is at risk or there is a risk of permanent injury. The child is acting strangely, much less alert or much more withdrawn than usual. The child has difficulty breathing or is unable to speak. The child's skin or lips look blue, purple, or gray. The child has rhythmic jerking of arms and legs and a loss of consciousness (seizure). The child is unconscious. The child is less and less responsive. The child manifests any of the following after a head injury: decrease in level of alertness, confusion, headache, vomiting, irritability, or difficulty walking. The child has increasing or severe pain anywhere. The child has a cut or burn that is large, deep, and/or won't stop bleeding. The child is vomiting blood. The child has a severe stiff neck, headache, and fever. The child is significantly dehydrated: sunken eyes , lethargic, not making tears, not urinating. After you have called EMS, remember to call the child's legal guardian. Some children may have urgent situations that do not necessarily require ambulance transport but still need medical attention. The box below lists some of these more common situations. The legal guardian should be informed of the following conditions. If you or the guardian cannot reach the physician within one hour, the child should be brought to a hospital. Get medical attention within one hour for: Fever in any age child who looks more than mildly ill. Fever in a child less than 2 months (8 weeks) of age. A quickly spreading purple or red rash. A large volume of blood in the stools. A cut that may require stitches. Any medical condition specifically outlined in a child's care plan requiring parental notification. \u00a9 2006 UNC-CH/MCH and NC DHHS/DCDAMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS RELATED TO GIVING MEDICINE IN CHILD CARE The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), passed July 26, 1990 as Public Law 101-336 (42 U.S.C. Sec. 12101 et seq. ), became effective on January 26, 1992. The ADA requires that child care provider/directors not discriminate against persons with disabilities on the basis of disability, that is, that they provide children and parent/guardians with disabilities with an equal opportunity to participate in child care programs and services. Child care facilities must make reasonable modifications to their policies and practices, such as giving medicine, to integrate children with disabilities. 1. Q: Does the Americans with Disabilities Act -- or \"ADA\" -- apply to child care centers? What about family child care homes? A: Yes. Almost all child care facilities, even small, home-based centers regardless of size or number of employees, must comply with title III of the ADA. Child care services provided by government agencies must comply with title II. The exception is child care centers that are actually run by religious entities such as churches, mosques, or synagogues. Activities controlled by religious organizations are not covered by title III. 2. Q: Our facility has a policy that we will not give medication to any child. Can I refuse to give medication to a child with a disability? A: No. In some circumstances, it may be necessary to give medication to a child with a disability in order to make a program accessible to that child. Disabilities include any physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities including asthma, diabetes, seizure disorders, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). 3. Q: What about children who have severe, sometimes life-threatening allergies to bee stings or certain foods? Do we have to take them? A: Generally, yes. Children cannot be excluded on the sole basis that they have been identified as having severe allergies to bee stings or certain foods. A child care facility needs to be prepared to take appropriate steps in the event of an allergic reaction, such as administering a medicine called \"epinephrine\" that will be provided in advance by the child's parents or guardians. 4. Q: What about children with diabetes? Do we have to admit them to our program? If we do, do we have to test their blood sugar levels? A: Generally, yes. Children with diabetes should not be excluded from the program on the basis of their diabetes. Providers should obtain written authorization from the child's parents or guardians and physician and follow their directions for simple diabetes-related care. In most instances, they will authorize the provider to monitor the child's blood sugar -- or \"blood glucose\". The child's parents or guardians are responsible for providing all appropriate testing equipment, training, and special food necessary for the child. 5. Q: What about children with asthma? Do we have to admit them to our program? A: Generally, yes. Children with asthma should not be excluded from the program on the basis of their medical condition. Providers should obtain written authorization from the child's parents or guardians and physician and follow their directions for asthma care. 6. Q: Are there any reference books or video tapes that might help me further understand the obligations of child care providers under title III? A: Yes, the Arc published All Kids Count: Child Care and the ADA , which addresses the ADA's obligations of child care providers. Copies are available by calling 1-800-433-5255. For general information child care providers may call the Department of Justice Information Line at 1-800-514-0301.

S. Dept. of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Distributed by Division of Child Development Issue Brief #2 \u008a 2009 UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON Center for Public Health Nutrition Best Practices for Nutrition, Physical Activity & Screen Media in Child Care Settings \u0084 Children who receive CACFP mealseat healthier food than children who bring meals and snacks from home.1 \u0084 Adding portable play equipment to an outdoor preschool playground significantly increases physical activity in 35 year old boys and girls. 2 \u0084 For 3 year olds, each one hour increment of TV viewing per day is linked to consumption of more sugarsweetened beverages, fast food, and calories; and less fruit, vegetables, calcium , and fiber.3 The child care setting strongly influences child behavior and early habits. Successful childhood obesity prevention efforts focus on creating healthy environments that make healthy choices possible. Research shows that nutrition, physical activity, and screen media behaviors are linked to a child's physical and social development. This issue brief offers practical steps based on recommendations from leading researchers, clinicians, child care providers and others in the child care field. These best practices can serve as a guide for policy change in all types of child care settings. While some actions are easy to do, others increase costs and require additional effort. To fully implement these steps, child care providers will require more support, training, technical assistance, and funding from public and private sources. 1. Make every calorie count by offering a variety of healthy foods. Children's early experiences with food influence their preferences and consumption\u2014they like what they know. Good eating habits come from exposure to healthy food and pleasant meal and snack times. Below are some specific measures that child care providers can take. \u0084 Develop and follow a menu that includes a selection of nutritious foods. \u0084 Include nutrition and feeding policies and practices in the orientation for new employees and regularly review policies with employees. \u0084 Include a policy about foods brought from home in the parent guidebook. \u0084 Find out if you are eligible for the USDA Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) to help with food costs and menu planning. \u0084 Provide meals, snacks, and beverages as suggested by a nutrition consultant, or as required by licensing or CACFP. 9 Juice: If you serve juice, make it 100% juice and onl y provide to children older than 12 months. Serve in cups not bottles and limit to 4 ounces per day. 9 Sweetened Beverages: Avoid beverages with added sweeteners. Instead, offer milk to provide calcium and Vitamin D whic h are essential for bone growth. 9 Water: Make water available at all times. Encourage water with snack and meal times. 9 Low\u00adnutrition, high fat, high calorie foods: Offer sparingly and provide healthy suggestions to parents for special events. 9 Grain products: Make most of your grains whole. Look on labels for the wor ds whole wheat or whole oats, etc. These provide fiber to help digestion. 9 Vegetables: Vary your veggies. Consider new ways to serve them. Use to intr oduce different colors, shapes and textures. 9 Fruits: Try new colors. Choose fresh, frozen, canned or dried. 9 Meat & Meat Alternatives: Choose lowfat or lean meats and limit high fat products (hot dogs, chicken nuggets, etc.). Try different types of bean products. 9 Milk products: Go lowfat (1%) or fat free for children 2 years and older. Limit flavored milks. Recommendations 2. Create healthy meal and snack times. \u0084 Serve food in common bowls and pitchers to pass around so children can serve themselves. \u0084 Have adults eat with children for safety and to model healthy eating. \u0084 Introduce new foods with familiar foods. \u0084 Let the child decide how much to eat. Healthy meal times are not just about the food. 3. Move throughout the day. A child's health, development, and learning depend on getting physical activity every day. \u0084 Offer 3060 minutes of ageappropriate physical activity and play daily. \u0084 Train teachers to engage and lead children in physical activities. \u0084 Incorporate movement (stretching, dancing, marching, jumping, crawling) into all aspects of the curriculum, including transition times. \u0084 Include policies in the parent handbook about outside play and physical activity. Ask parents to dress children in clothes that encourage active play. Keep extra mittens, hats, and coats on hand. Physical activity is more than exercise. 4. Minimize Screen Media Time. Even young children are widely exposed to screen media\u2014television, video, video games, computers, phones\u2014every day. The long term effects are unknown. However, research has linked TV viewing by young children to increased aggressive and antisocial behavior, lower academic performance, poor nutrition, obesity, and sleep disorders. Because of these adverse effects, the American Academy of Pediatrics (www.aap.org ) recommends: \u0084 No TV viewing for children younger than 2 years. \u0084 Limit children's total media time for noneducational purposes to no more than 12 hours per day. \u0084 Encourage active games, listening and moving to music, and creative play to foster interaction and help brain development. Less screen time means more time for play. For more information and tools to put these practices in action see www.cphn.org References 1 Bruening KS et al.

Healthy child development depends on eating nutritious food and being physically active every day. This is especially important during the preschool years when children are rapidly building their brains and bodies. Millions of America's children spend hours in outofhome child care each day. The care environment greatly influences what children eat and do, and can play a key role in preventing childhood obesity. Policies for nutrition, physical activity, screen media, and training for child care providers are important tools for getting children on track for good health. 1. Child care impacts children at a critical stage of development. Obesity prevention must start early in life. Many young children have little opportunity for sustained physical activity during child care and are fed high calorie, low nutrient foods. Child care practices and policies can have widespread and longterm impact. 2. Child care practice is associated with childhood obesity. A large national study found that the type of child care in the year before kindergarten is linked to obesity. Children cared for by a parent or in licensed child care centers are less likely to start kindergarten obese than children in child care offered by extended family, friends, and neighbors.4 In the US, 33 to 53% of children under 5 yrs old with employed parents are cared for in these unlicensed settings.5 This underscores the need for education and policies that support good practices in all types of child care. 3. Child care offers opportunities for health promotion. Obesity prevention efforts must happen both in and out of the home. Guidelines that encourage healthy behaviors for children in child care can also benefit their families. Providing information to parents can increase their understanding of children's nutritional needs and help improve home meals and sack lunches sent to child care. 4. Child care is an investment in tomorrow's students. Well fed, healthy children are better prepared to focus and learn in the classroom. Quality child care across all settings would help reduce differences in early learning experiences that can lead to gaps in school readiness.

Educate staff and parents about t he importance of breastfeeding. 2. Train staff in the skills necessary to handle, store and feed the mother's milk properly. 3. Review with parents how to properly store and label milk for child care program use. 4. Provide a comfortable place for mot hers to nurse their babies or pump (express milk). 5. Develop a feeding plan with the parents that is r egularly updated and posted in the infant room. 6. Refer mothers to the Breastfeeding Coordinator or Woman, Infant, and Children's Coordinator at the local Health Departments. Keep a list of community resources related to breas tfeeding and infant nutrition in child care and contact them for educational opportunities. 7. Display posters and provide broc hures for new mothers and parents of breastfeeding babies to show that your child care supports breastfeeding and best practice. 8. Provide updates to staff on bes t practices and trends related to breastfeeding. 9. Allow staff sufficient break time to breastfeed or express milk while working. 10. Get feedback about your breastfeedi ng support by including a related question on your parent surveys.

Wind-Chill and Heat Index information is from the National Weather Service. Child Care Weather Watch Watching the weather is part of a child care provider's job. Planning for playtime, field trips, or weather safe- ty is part of the daily routine. The changes in weathe r require the child care provider to monitor the health and safety of children. What clothing, be verages, and protections are appropriate? Clothe children to main- tain a comfortable body temperature (warmer months - lightweight cotton, colder months - wear layers of clothing). Beverages help the body maintain a comfortable temperat ure. Water or fruit juices are best. Avoid high-sugar content beverages and soda pop. Sunscreen may be used year around. Use a sunscreen la- beled as SPF-15 or higher. Read and follow all label instructions for the sunscreen product. Look for sun- screen with UVB and UVA ray protection. Shaded play areas protect children from the sun. Condition GREEN - Children may play outdoors and be comfortable. Watch for signs of children be- coming uncomfortable while playing. Use precaut ions regarding clothing, sunscreen, and beverages for all child age groups. INFANTS AND TODDLERS are unable to tell the child care provider if they are too hot or cold. Children become fussy when uncomfortable. Infants /toddlers will tolerate shorter periods of outdoor play. Dress infants/toddlers in lightweight cotton or cotton-like fabrics during the warmer months. In cooler or cold months dress infants in layers to keep them warm. Protect infants from the sun by li- miting the amount of time outdoors and playing in shaded areas. Give beverages when playing out- doors. YOUNG CHILDREN remind children to stop playi ng, drink a beverage, and apply more sunscreen. OLDER CHILDREN need a firm approach to wearing proper clothing for the weather (they may want to play without coats, hats or mittens). They may resist applying sunscreen and drinking beverages while outdoors. Condition YELLOW - use caution and closely observe the children for signs of being too hot or cold while outdoors. Clothing, sunscreen, and beverages are important. Shorten the length of outdoor time. INFANTS AND TODDLERS use precautions outlined in Condition Green. Clothing, sunscreen, and beverages are important. Shorten t he length of time for outdoor play. YOUNG CHILDREN may insist they are not too hot or cold because they are enjoying playtime. Child care providers need to structure the length of time for outdoor play for the young child. OLDER CHILDREN need a firm approach to wearing proper clothing for the weather (they may want to play without coats, hats or mittens), applyi ng sunscreen and drinking liquids while playing out- doors. Condition RED - most children should not play outdoors due to the health risk. INFANTS/TODDLERS should play indoors a nd have ample space for large motor play. YOUNG CHILDREN may ask to play outside and do not understand the potential danger of weather conditions. OLDER CHILDREN may play outdoors for very short per iods of time if they are properly dressed, have plenty of fluids. Child care providers must be vigilant about maximum protection of children.Understand the Weather The weather forecast may be confusing unless you know the meaning of the words. Blizzard Warning: There will be snow and strong winds that produce a blinding snow, deep drifts, and life threatening wind chills. Seek shelter immediately. Heat Index Warning: How hot it feels to the body when the air temperature (in Fahren-heit) and relative humidity are combined. Relative Humidity: The percent of moisture in the air. Temperature: The temperature of the air in degrees Fahrenheit. Wind: The speed of the wind in miles per hour. Wind Chill Warning: There will be sub-zero temperatures with moderate to strong winds expected which may cause hypothermia and great danger to people, pets and livestock. Winter Weather Advisory: Weather condi- tions may cause significant inconveniences and may be hazardous. If caution is exer-cised, these situations should not become life threatening. Winter Storm Warning: Severe winter con- ditions have begun in your area. Winter Storm Watch: Severe winter condi- tions, like heavy snow and ice are possible within the next day or two. Air Quality Index Guidelines to protect your health Care for the air Good 0-50 Code GreenNo health effects expected.

June 2009.The daily air quality forecast covers two common air pollutants: Ground-level ozone forms when pollutants from cars, power plants and other sources combine in hot sunlight. Ozone is a lung irritant that causes shortness of breath, irritates throats and eyes, and aggravates asthma. Ozone levels are highest outdoors from early afternoon to early evening on hot, sunny days. Particle pollution is a mixture of very small solids and liquids suspended in air . These tiny particles can reach deep into the lungs, where they can aggravate asthma and other lung conditions, and even cause heart problems. Particle pollution can be high at any time of day or night, and any time of year . High particle levels often are caused by forest fires or residential wood burning, especially when weather conditions causes pollution to stay close to the ground. The daily forecast always tells you which pollutant is of greatest concern. Air Quality Forecasts and Information: www .ncair .org / 1-888-RU4NCAIR (1-888-784-6224)Children, active people, older adults, and those with heart or lung disease (like asthma): avoid prolonged or heavy exertion. Everyone else: limit prolonged or heavy exertion.Conserve energy: drive less and use less electricity . Carpool, use public transportation, bike or walk whenever possible. Keep your car , boat, lawnmower and other engines tuned and maintained. Keep tires properly inflated and wheels aligned. Never burn your trash. This is illegal and releases toxic chemicals. Avoid burning leaves and brush, which is sometimes legal but always pollutes the air .Air Quality Color Guide Division of Air QualityDEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT AND NA TURAL RESOURCES www.ncair.orgHow can air quality affect your health? Air pollution irritates the lungs and respiratory system, and can even af fect the heart. Air pollution can make asthma worse, trigger asthma attacks, or cause the onset of asthma. Even healthy people can have trouble taking deep breaths on \"bad air\" days, and can experience damage to lung tissues. Repeated damage, especially during childhood, can reduce lung function permanently . Particle pollution, a type of air pollution, has been linked to serious cardiac problems including arrhythmias and heart attacks. Who' s at risk? Anyone can experience health ef fects - whether noticed or unnoticed - at air pollution levels of code red or above. But these sensitive groups can be af fected at lower levels: All children. Children breathe at a higher respiratory rate, their lungs are still developing, and they are likely to be active outdoors. Children also have a higher rate of asthma. Older adults, because they are more likely to have undiagnosed heart or lung disease. Anyone with respiratory disease such as asthma or emphysema, and anyone with a heart condition such as coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure. Anyone who is frequently active outdoors. In addition, certain \"unusually sensitive\" individuals can experience breathing problems even at code yellow levels. How can you protect your health? Know the Code. Pay attention to the daily air quality forecast. Know your body . Be aware of any health conditions that may increase your risk. Notice if you experience breathing dif ficulties or other problems on bad air days. Limit your outdoor physical activity on code orange or worse days, especially if you're a member of a sensitive group. Pollution exposure depends on the length of time and level of exertion. Any activity that raises your breathing rate increases your risk. You don't need to stay indoors, but \"take it easy\" outdoors to reduce your risk. If you have a heart condition, use special caution on forecasted high particle pollution days. Particle pollution can be high at any time of day or night, unlike ozone pollution, which is highest in the afternoons. Particles also can penetrate indoors, unlike ozone, so indoor particle levels may be higher than normal on high particle pollution days. Limit indoor exertion, as well as outdoor exertion, on forecasted high particle days. Do your share to care for the air . Driving less, keeping your car tuned, and using less electricity reduces emissions from cars and coal-fired power plants, so that everyone can breathe easier .

Facts y ou should kno w about air quality Division of Air Qualitywww.ncair.orgGetting Started: Ten Free or Inexpensive Ideas to Enrich Your Outdoor Learning Environment Today* 1. Plant a tree . . . or shrub or bush. Your Cooperative Extension Agency or the US Forest Service may be able to help you locate free, native trees such as dogwood, longleaf pine, redbud, sassafras or native red cedar. Blueberries and oakleaf hydrang ea are good choices for versatile bushes. A three foot tall fig tree ($12) will double in size in one year and w ill provide a shady retreat where children can play while still in your sight. Fig leaves are very interesting. When the fruit matures, the children can harvest fi gs for cooking activities. Yummy! 2. Hang a bird feeder . . . or two or three. Use the area ju st outside the classroom window so children can watch the birds when they are playing inside, t oo. Birds are attracted to different kinds of seeds and food. Experiment and help the childre n discover various birds' preferences. 3. Create a special place for digging . Use existing dirt or buy soil from a nursery. Provide shovels, spoons, buckets and whatever accessories complement th e play themes that children initiate. What might happen if you filled the dirt di gging area with sand? A tarp wi ll protect the digging area when it's not in use. 4. Place a log outside the heavily trafficked area. Children can use the log as a bench. Little scientists will discover cap tivating beetles under the bark. They can roll the log to find all sorts of interesting things underneath. They can observe ch anges as the log disintegrates over time. 5. Designate a table or shelf as an outside discovery center . This is an area where items collected during nature walks can be placed and studied. Collec tions of rocks, seeds, pine cones and leaves can be counted, sorted, sequenced and drawn. Encourage children to bring natural items to the center that have been collected from their homes and neighborhoods. 6. Plant a cornfield. (Think on a three-year-old scale.) Chart the growth of the stalks. Pumpkins planted under the shelter of the co rn will thrive if the soil is good a nd rich. Imagine all the science and math the children will learn beginning with planti ng season through harvest. What fun to stand in the middle of the 'field' shaded by lush plants! 7. Create a whiskey barrel herb garden. Plant chives, rosemary, parsle y, marjoram, lavender, bronze fennel and basil for a fragrant and edible garden that will attract beautiful butterflies. Cost? Whiskey barrel ($20), soil ($20), . . Don't forget to water! 8. Construct a rose arbor. Okay, this one may take longer than a day to pull off but you may have a talented parent who would love to help. Imagine a shady, sweetly fragrant outdoor space with seating where children and adults can gather to play, read , dance, stage plays, or simply experience natural beauty . . . aahh. A thornless climbing vine such as the Banksiae Rose will cover a wooden arbor in no time. The fragrance is incredible. Eventually, children will notice birds bu ilding nests in the arbor and imaginations will light up with possible uses for such an appealing outdoor space. 9. Plant a North Carolina heritage garden. Okra and black-eyed peas do well together. Cabbage and turnips or a three sisters garden of beans, corn and squash would be fun to grow. Harvest and cook the vegetables. If you grow okra, harvest and cook the okra, but leave some to dry on the stalk. Watch them develop into beautiful striped seed po ds that make wonderful rhythm instruments for small hands. When you are ready, ta ke the dried pods apart to find th e seeds. Plant them in the spring. Pods can also be used to create animal figures. 10. Inventory natural elements. Take a walk with the childr en around your outdoor environment to document what you find. Use photographs, charts, tape recorders and dictation to record observations. Even toddlers can make bark rubbings. How ma ny trees are on the playground? How many animals and what kinds of animals live there? What colors do you notice? Expa nd on the documentation by creating a list of what the children would like to s ee/do/smell/hear in their outdoor environment. This activity may lead to amazing transformations . . . _____________________________________________________________________________________ *We've heard from administrators and teachers who value high quality outdoor environments and understand the importance of nature and explorat ion for the physical, emotional/social, and cognitive well-being of children. This document is intended to inspire those who are ready to make the leap and want a place to start. Mary Bradford, Nancy Easterling, Tris h Mengel and Virginia Sullivan Professional Development Work Group of the NC Outdoor Learning Environment (OLE) Alliance What the Research Shows: A Summary RESEARCH -BASED INDICATORS OF THE NATURE DEFICIT Children today spend less time playing outdoors than any previous generation. 82 percent of mothers wit h children between the ages of 3 and 12 cited crime and safety concerns as one of the primary reasons they do not allow their children to pl ay outdoors. (Clements, 2004) Today's children have a more restri cted range in which they can play freely, have fewer playmates who ar e less diverse, and are more home- centered than any previous generation. (Karsten, 2005) Children's free play and discretionary time declined more than seven hours a week from 1981 to 1997 and an additional two hour s from 1997 to 2003, totaling nine hours less a week of time over a 25-year period in which children can choose to partici pate in unstructured activities. (Hofferth and Sandberg, 2001; Hofferth and Curtin, 2006) Children between the ages of six m onths and six years spend an average of 1.5 hours a day with electronic medi a, and youth between the ages of 8 and 18 spend an average of 6.5 hours a day with electronic media\u2014that's more than 45 hours a week! (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2005 and 2006) Obesity in children has increased from about 4 percent in the 1960s to close to 20 percent in 2004. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2006) 62 percent of children do not participat e in any organized physical activity and 23 percent do not participate in any free-time physical activity. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2003) The percent of children who live withi n a mile of school and who walk or bike to school has declined nearly 25 percent in the past 30 years. Barely 21 percent of children today live withi n one mile of their school. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2006) While 71 percent of adults report that they walked or rode a bike to school when they were young, only 22 percent of children do so today. (Beldon Russonello and Stewart Resear ch and Communications, 2003) Children & Nature Network 1 94 percent of parents say that safety is their biggest concern when making decisions about whether to allow thei r children to engage in free play in the out- of- doors. (Bagley , Ball and Salmon, 2006) Children predominantly play at home, with their activities monitored and controlled by adults, compared to children a generation ago. Only 3 percent of today's children have a high degree of mobility and freedom in how and where they play. (Tandy, 1999) Children can identify 25 percent more Pokemon c haracters than wildlife species at eight years old. (Balmfol d, Clegg, Coulson and Taylor, 2002) RESEARCH -BASED INDICATORS OF NATURE 'S BENEFITS TO CHILDREN Contact with the natural world ca n significantly reduce symptoms of attention deficit disorder in children as young as five years old. (Kuo and Taylor, 2004) The greener a child's everyday env ironment, the more manageable are their symptoms of attention-deficit disorder. (Taylor, Kuo and Sullivan, 2001) Access to green spaces for play, and even a view of green settings, enhances peace, self-control and self-di scipline within inner city youth, and particularly in girls. (Taylor, Kuo and Sullivan, 2001) Green plants and vistas reduce stre ss among highly-stressed children in rural areas, with the results the most significant where there are the greatest number of plants, green view s and access to natural play areas. (Wells and Evans, 2003) Proximity to, views of, and daily expos ure to natural settings increases children's ability to focus and enhances cognitive abilitie s. (Wells, 2000) Nature is important to children' s development in every major way\u2014 intellectually, emotionally, socially, sp iritually and physically. Play in nature is especially important for developing capacities for creativity, problem- solving, and intellectual developmen t. Therefore changes in our modern built environments should be made to opt imize children's positive contact with nature. (Kellert, 2005) Children will be smarter, better able to get along with others, healthier and happier when they have regular opport unities for free and unstructured play in the out-of-doors. (Burdette and Whitaker, 2005) Positive direct experience in the out-of-doors and being taken outdoors by someone close to the child\u2014a parent, grandparent, or other trusted guardian\u2014are the two factors that most contribute to individuals choosing to take action to benefit the env ironment as adults. (Chawla, 2006) Children & Nature Network 2 Children & Nature Network 3 Children who experience school grounds with diverse natural settings are more physically active, more aware of nutrition, more civil to one another and more creative. (Bell and Dyment, 2006) Outdoor experiences for teens result in enhanced self-esteem, self- confidence, independence, autonomy and initiative. These positive results persist through many years. (Kellert with Derr, 1998) Factoring out other variables, st udies of students in California and nationwide show that schools that use outdoor classrooms and other forms of nature-based experiential education produce significant student gains in social studies, science, language arts, and math. One recent study found that students in outdoor science programs improved their science testing scores by 27 percent. (American Institutes for Research, 2005) Studies of children in sc hoolyards with both green areas and manufactured play areas found that children engaged in more creative forms of play in the green areas, and t hey also played more cooperatively.

What Teachers/Caregivers can expec t to gain from \"taking on\" the OUTDOORS . . . By Virginia Sullivan, Principal, Learning by the Yard, Consultants to School Grounds, and Janet McGinnis, Program Consulta nt, NC Office of School Readiness It's good for you, too! The April 2007 issue of the NC Child Care Health and Safety Bulletin is filled with inform ation about how the outdoors is healthy for children and important for their growth and development (www.healthychild carenc.org). Well guess what? It's healthy for adults too! Wh en you think abou t your typical day in your early care and education setting, how much time are YOU spending in the fresh air, in fu ll spectrum sunlight, in an environment that has lots of \"gre en\" - plants, trees? The health benefits of being outdoors continues throughout life. There is even evidence that exposure to green spaces is healing. Research tells us that in hospital settings, patients that have window views onto green space (plants, trees.) heal faster than those who don't. We are just beginning to understand the health value of the outdoors for all of us. Pleasure and relief from stress: Many teachers who develop rich outdoor environments report that they can't wait to get to school to see what is happening outside. They say that being outsi de makes them feel calm, happy and peaceful. And the pleasure is guilt-free. Research shows that when adults share this interest and pleasure with children, it contributes to children's learning and well being. Sense of freedom: When you open the door for the children to go outside, babies will kick with joy, toddler s attempt to run, and older children \"charge\" across the play yard with delight and enthusiasm, expressing their joy in the freedom found outside the cl assroom. Have you ever noticed that you feel the same way? Many teachers have had little chance themselves to explore nature outside. You may therefore think you don't know enough about nature. But you don't have to have all the answers. Children will notice and ask about the most incredible things (as you know) It is fun, freeing and appropriate for teachers to respond to questi ons by saying, \"Let's find out together! This is how we learn...\". A rose is a rose is a rose . . . (but so much more!). Did you know that floral scents contribute to cognitive functioning - making teachers as well as children smarter, more alert and ready to learn? Need exercise? No time to go to the gym? Try playing \"follow the leader\" with a child. Let them lead you and see how much exercise you get! This is a chance for you to enjoy the details in nature, notice the shape of a leaf, the color of a flower, the sound of the wind. By talking about what you see, hear, and feel, you are modeling language and showi ng children that you care about the environment. Think of it as free educati onal materials: acorns for counting, leaves for sorting and counting, shadows to notice, branches to build with, shrubs to hide in, flowers to smell, birds to observe... The environment as teacher: Many teachers say a well-equi pped outdoor environment is like having another teacher. Why is that? . . . Because children are naturally curious and attracted to things in their environment. They want to explore hills, trees, plants, butterflies, worms, grass, sand, water... sunshine and shadow. A rich outdoor environment suggests things to do.' Try chasing your shadow!' ' Climb up the hill.' You will find that children talk more and ask more questions in the outdoor environment. All of this is great for their development and exciting for you as well! So . . . . know ing you are doing the right thing for children ...and for yourself! References: Chawla, Louise 2006.
