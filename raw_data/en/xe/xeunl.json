Non Index (BMI) <18.5 . Breastfeeding Women less than 6 Months current Body Mass Index (BMI) <18.5 . Breastfeeding Women 6 Months P ostpartum Body Mass Index (BMI) <18.5 . Note: A BMI table is attached to assist in determining weight classification. Also, u ntil research supports the use of different BMI cut -offs to determine weight status categories for adolescent pregnancies, the same BMI cut -offs will be used for all women, re gardless of age, when determining WIC eligibility (1). (See Justification for a more detailed explanation.) Participant Category and Priority L evel Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I Non -Breastfeeding Women III, IV, V or VI Justification Underweight women who become pregnant are at a higher risk for delivery of low birth weight (LBW) infants, retarded fetal growth, and perinatal mortality. Prepregnancy underweight is also associated with a higher incidence of various pregnancy complications, such as antepartum hemorrhage, premature rupture of membranes, anemia, endometriosis, and cesarean delivery (2). The goal in prenatal nutritional counseling provided by WIC is to achieve recommended weight gain by emphasizing food choices of high nutritional quality; and for the underweight woman, by encouraging increased consumption and/or the inclusion of some calorically dense foods. The 2009 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report: Weight Gain During Pregnancy: Reexamining the Guidelines (1) updated the pregnancy weight categories to conform to the categories developed by the World Health Organization and adopted by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in 1998 (3). The reexamination of the guidelines consisted of a review of the determinants of a wide range of short-and long-term consequences of variation in weight gain during pregnancy for both the mother and her infant. The IOM 1 of 3 07/2009 101 2 of 3 Anthropometric: Underweight (Women ) prenatal weight gain recommendations based on prepregnancy weight status categories are associated with improved maternal and child health outcomes (1). Included in the 2009 IOM guidelines is the recommendation that the BMI weight categories used for adult women be used for pregnant adolescents as well. More research is needed to determine whether specia l categories are needed for adolescents. It is recognized that both the IOM cut-offs for defining weight categories will classify some adolescents differently than the CDC BMI-for-age charts. For the purpose of WIC eligibility determination, the IOM cut- offs will be used for all women regardless of age. However, due to the lack of research on relevant BMI cut- offs for pregnant and postpartum adolescents, professionals should use all of the tools available to them to assess these applicants' anthropometri c status and tailor nutrition counseling accordingly. Weight during the early postpartum period, when most WIC certifications occur, is very unstable. During the first 4-6 weeks fluid shifts and tissue changes cause fluctuations in weight. After 6 weeks, weight loss varies among women. Prepregnancy weight, amount of weight gain during pregnancy, race, age, parity and lactation all influence the rate of postpartum weight loss. By 6 months postpartum, body weight is more stable and should be close to the prepregnancy weight. In most cases therefore, prepregnancy weight is a better indicator of weight status than postpartum weight in the first 6 months after delivery. The one exception is the woman with a BMI of 18.5 during the immediate 6 months after delivery. Underweight at this stage may indicate inadequate weight gain during pregnancy, depression, an eating disorder or disease, any or all of which need to be addressed (4). While being on the lean side of normal weight is generally considered healthy, being underweight can be indicative of poor nutritional status, inadequate food consumption, and/or an underlying medical condition. Underweight women who are breastfeeding may be further impacting their own nutritional status. Should she become pregnant again, an underweight woman is at a higher risk for delivery of low birth weight (LBW) infant(s), retarded fetal growth, and perinatal mortality. The role of the WIC Program is to assist underweight women in the achievement of a healthy dietary intake and body mass index. References 1. Institute of Medicine.

For the Birth to < 24 months \"underweight\" definition, CDC labels the 2.3rd percentile as the 2nd percentile on the Birth to 24 months gender specific growth charts. For more information about the percentile cut -off, please see Clarification. Note: The Birth to 24 months and the 2000 CDC growth charts are available at: www.cdc.gov/ growthcharts . Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Infants I Children III 05/2011 103 2 of 3 Anthropometric: Underweight or At Risk of Underweight (Infants and Children) Justification The CDC uses the 2.3rd percentile weight-for-length (for birth to 24 months of age) and the 5th percentile BMI-for-age (for 2-5 years of age), as the cut-offs to define underweight in its Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance System (1 , 2). However, CDC does not have a position regarding the cut-off percentile, whic h should be used to determine at risk of underweight as a nutrition risk in the WIC Program. At risk of underweight is included in this criterion to reflect the preventive emphasis of the WIC Program. A review of literature on weight-for-length or stature cut-off percentiles indicates that: a) many children at or below the 5th percentile for weight are in need of nutritional intervention, and b) those at or below the 10th percentile may be at nutritional risk and in need of preventive nutritional intervention, or at least further evaluation (4). Weight-for-length/stature describes body proportionality and is sensitive to acute undernutrition, but can also reflect long-term status (5). Physical growth delay is used as a proxy for the deleterious effects undernutrition can have on immune function, organ development, hormonal function and brain development (6). Implications for WIC Nutrition Services Participation in WIC has been associated with improved growth in both weight and height in children (7). An infant or child determined to be underweight at WIC certification should be monitored at regular intervals during the certification period, as appropriate. Through client-centered counseling, WIC staff can assist families in making nutritionally balanced food choices to promote adequate weight gain. Also, the foods provided by the WIC Program are scientifically-based and intended to address the supplemental nutritional needs of the Program's target population, and can be tailored to meet the needs of i ndividual participants. In addition, WIC staff can greatly assist families by providing referrals to medical providers and other services, if available, in their community. Such resources may provide the recommended medical assessments, in order to rule out or confirm medical conditions, and offer treatment when necessary and/or in cases where growth improvement is slow to respond to dietary interventions.

Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I Non -Breastfeeding Women III, IV, V or VI Justification Maternal overweight and obesity are associated with higher rates of cesarean delivery, gestational diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia and other pregnancy -induced hypertensive disorders, as well as postpartum anemia (2). Several studies have established an association between obesity and an increased risk for hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, cholelithiasis, coronary heart disease, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, stroke and certain cancers (1). One goal of prenatal nutritional counseling is to achie ve recommended weight gain during pregnancy. For the overweight woman, emphasis should be on selecting food choices of high nutritional quality and avoiding calorie -rich foods, thereby minimizing further risks associated with increased overweight and obes ity. The 2009 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report: Weight Gain During Pregnancy: Reexamining the Guidelines (1) upda ted the pregnancy weight categories to conform to the categories developed by the World Healt h O rganization and adopted by the National He art, Lung and Blood Institute in 1998 (3).

In most cases , therefore, prepregnancy weight is a better indicator of weight status than postpartum weight in the first 6 months after delivery (4). The percentage of adolescents who are overweight has increased rapidly and more than 60% of adults in the US are overweight. Due to the significant impact that overweight and obesity have on morbidity and mortality, it is imperative that every effort be made to identify individuals who are overweight and to assist them in achieving a more healthful weight. The WIC Program is in a position to play an important role in helping to reduce the prevalence of overweight not only by working with postpartum women on improving their own weight status, but also by helping them to see their role in assisting their children to learn healthful eating and physical activity behaviors.

Therefore, recumbent length measurements may not be used to determine this risk. See Clarification for more information . Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Children (2 -5 years of age) III Justification The rapid rise in the prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents is one of the most important public health issues in the United States today. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from the mid-1960s to the early 2000s document a significant increase in obesity among children from preschool age through adolescence. These trends parallel a concurrent increase in obesity among adults, suggesting that fundamental shifts occurring in dietary and/or physical activity behaviors are having an adverse effect on overall energy balance (3). The causes of increased obesity rates in the United States are complex. Both genetic make-up and environmental factors contribute to the obesity risk. Important contributors include a large and growing abundance of calorically dense foods and an increased sedentary lifestyle for all ages. Although obesity tends to run in families, a genetic predisposition does not inevitably result in obesity. Environmental and behavioral factors can influence the development of obesity in genetically at-risk people (3). BMI is a measure of body weight adjusted for height. While not a direct measure of body fatness, BMI is a useful screening tool to assess adiposity (3). Children >2 years of age, with a BMI-for-age > 85th and <95th percentile are considered overweight and those at or above the 95th percentile, obese (4). Research on BMI and body fatness shows that the majority of children with BMI-for-age at or above the 95th percentile have high adiposity and less than one-half of the children in the 85th to <95th percentiles have high adiposity (4). Although an imperfect tool, elevated BMI among children most often indicates increased risk for future adverse health outcomes and/or development of diseases (5). BMI should serve as the initial screen and as the starting point for classification of health risks (3). Use of the 95th percentile to define obesity identifies those children with a greater likelihood of being obese as adolescents and adults, with increased risk of obesity-related disease and mortality. It is recommended 05/2011 113 2 of 3 Anthropometric: Obese (Children 2 -5 Years of Age) that an obese child ( 95th percentile) undergo a medical assessment and careful evaluation to identify any underlying health risks or secondary complications (3). Obesity can result from excessive energy intake, decreased energy expenditure, or a medical condition that impairs the regulation of energy metabolism. In addition, obesity in early childhood may signify problematic feeding practices or evolving family behaviors that, if continued, may contribute to health risks in adulthood related to diet and inactivity. Implications for WIC Nutrition Services The WIC Program plays an important role in public health efforts to reduce the prevalence of obesity by actively identifying and enrolling young children who may be obese or at risk of overweight/obesity in later childhood or adolescence. When identifying this risk, it is important to communicate with parents/caregivers in a way that is supportive and nonjudgmental, and with a careful choice of words that convey an empathetic attitude and mi nimize embarrassment or harm to a child's self -esteem (4). In recognition of the importance of language, the 2007 American Medical Association Expert Committee Report recommends the use of the terms overweight and obese for documentation and risk assessment only and the use of more neutral terms (e.g., weight disproportional to height, excess weight, BMI ) when discussing a child's weight with a parent/caregive r (3) . BMI is calculated and plotted on growth charts at each WIC certification. However, growth charts are meant to be used as a screening tool and comprise only one aspect of the overall growth assessment. A clinical assessment to determine if a child is at a healthy weight is more complex. Weight classification (derived from the growth chart) should be integrated with the growth pattern, familial obesity, medical risks, and dietary and physical activity habits to determine the child's obesity risk ( 1, 5). The goal in WIC nutrition counseling is to help the child achieve recommended rates of growth and development. WIC staff can frame the discussion to make achieving normal growth a shared goal of the WIC Program and the parent/caregiver and make clear that obesity is a medical condition that can be addressed (4). Parents/caregivers of children may need education on recognition of satiety cues and other physiological needs that lead to crying, and ways to comfort a child (holding, reading, rocking) other than by feeding. The foods provided by the WIC Program are scientifically-based and intended to address the supplemental nutritional needs of the Program's target population and can be tailored to meet the needs of individual participants. Emphasis can be placed on promoting food choices of high nutritional quality while avoiding unnecessary or excessive amounts of calorie rich foods and beverages, and reducing inactivity (like decreasing sedentary TV viewing). Beliefs about what is an attractive or healthy weight, the importance of physical activity, what foods are desirable or appropriate for parents to provide to children, family mealtime routines, and many other lifestyle habits are influenced by different cultures, and should be considered during the nutrition assessment and counseling (6). The following resources for obesity prevention can be found at: Fit WIC addition, WIC staff can greatly assist families by providing referrals to medical providers and other services, if available, in their community. Such resources may provide the recommended medical assessments, in order to rule out or confirm medical conditions, and offer treatment when necessary and/or in cases where growth improvement is slow to respond to dietary interventions. 05/2 011 3 of 3 113 Anthropometric: Obese (Children 2 -5 Years of Age) References 1.

Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Infants I Children III 05/2011 114 2 of 5 Anthropometric: Overweight or At Risk of Overweight (Infants and Children) Justification The rise in the prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents is one of the most important public health issues in the United States today. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from the mid-1960s to the early 2000s document a significant increase in overweight among children from preschool age through adolescence. These trends parallel a concurrent increase in obesity among adults, suggesting that fundamental shifts in dietary and/or physical activity behaviors are having an adverse effect on overall energy balance (3). BMI is a measure of body weight adjusted for height. While not a direct measure of body fatness, BMI is a useful screening tool to assess adiposity (3). Children > 2 years of age, with a BMI-for-age > 85th and < 95th percentile are considered overweight and those at or above the 95th percentile, obese (4). Research on BMI and body fatness shows that the majority of children with BMI-for-age at or above the 95th percentile have high adiposity and less than one-half of the children in the 85th to < 95th percentiles have high adiposity (4). Although an imperfect tool, elevated BMI among children most often indicates increased risk for future adverse health outcomes and/or development of diseases (5). BMI should serve as the initial screen and as the starting point for classification of health risks (3 ). Increasingly, attention is being focused on the need for comprehensive strategies that focus on preventing overweight/obesity and a sedentary lifestyle for all ages. Scientific evidence suggests that the presence of obesity in a parent greatly increases the risk of overweight in preschoolers, even when no other overt signs of increasing body mass are present (6). The presence of parental obesity should lead to greater efforts by nutrition services staff to assist families in establishing or improving healthy behaviors (3). Implications for WIC Nutrition Services The WIC Program plays an important role in public health efforts to reduce the prevalence of obesity by actively identifying and enrolling infants and children who may be overweight or at risk of overweight in childhood or adolescence. When identifying this risk, it is important to communicate it in a way that is supportive, nonjudgmental, and with a careful choice of words to convey an empathetic attitude and to minimize embarrassment or harm to a child's self -esteem (4). In recognition of the importance of language, the 2007 American Medical Association expert committee report recommends the use of the terms overweight and obese for documentation and risk assessment only and the use of more neutral terms (e.g., weight disproportional to height, excess weight, BMI ) when discussing a child's weight with a parent/caregive r (3) . BMI is calculated and plotted on growth charts at each WIC certification. However, growth charts are meant to be used as a screening tool and comprise only one aspect of the overall growth assessment. A clinical assessment to determine if a child is at a healthy weight is more complex. Weight classification (derived from the growth chart) should be integrated with the growth pattern, familial obesity, medical risks, and dietary and physical activity habits to determine the child's obesity risk ( 1,5). The goal in WIC nutrition counseling is to help the child achieve recommended rates of growth and development. WIC staff can frame the discussion to make achieving normal growth a shared goal of the WIC Program and the parent/caregiver. Studies have shown that the early childhood eating environment provides a great opportunity for preventive intervention (7) . Parents/caregivers of infants and toddlers may need education on recognition of satiety cues and other physiological needs that lead to crying, and ways to comfort a child (holding, reading, rocking) other than by feeding. Young children look upon their parents as role models for eating behaviors.

CDC labels the 97.7th percentile as the 98th percentile on the Birth to 24 months gender specific growth charts. For more information about the percentile cut -off, please see Clarification. Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Infants I Children (< 24 months of age) III Justification In 2006, WHO released international growth standards for infants and children aged 0-59 months (2), similar to the 2000 CDC growth references. Since then, the CDC has developed Birth to 24 months growth charts, based on the WHO growth standards, and recommends their use in the United States (1). For persons 2- 20 years, the 2000 CDC growth charts will continue to be used (1). The WHO and CDC growth charts are similar in that both describe weight-for-age, length (or stature)-for- age, weight-for-length (or stature) and body mass index (BMI) for age. However, they differ in the approach taken to create the growth charts. The WHO growth charts are growth standards that describe how healthy children grow under optimal environmental and health conditions. The 2000 CDC charts are a growth reference, not a standard, and describe how certain children grew in a particular place and time (2). The WHO growth standards for children < 24 months are based on data collected from 1997-2003 in 6 countries (including the U.S.), from children who were born between 37 and 42 weeks gestation, breastfed for at least 12 months, and introduced to complementary food by at least 6 months but not before 4 months. Infants and children of low-income mothers and/or mothers who smoked were not included in the data sample (2). The 2000 CDC charts for infants and children < 36 months are based on birth weight (from 1968 to 1980 and from 1985 to 1994) and birth length data (from 1989 to1994) obtained from U.S. birth certificates; National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data; and, measurements from infants who had been breastfed and formula fed (approximately 50% ever breastfed and approximately 33% who were 05/2011 115 2 of 4 Anthropometric: High Weight for Length (Infants and Children < 24 Months of Age) still breastfeeding at 3 months). Very low birth weight infants were not included in the sample population. This was the only exclusion criterion applied to the sample population (2, 3). Prior to making its recommendation, CDC convened an Expert Panel with the National Institutes of Health and the American Academy of Pediatrics to review the scientific evidence and discuss the potential use of the WHO growth standards in the U.S. The recommendation to use WHO growth standards for infants and children < 24 months was made on the basis of input from the Expert Panel. In addition, CDC concluded that the WHO growth standards are based on a high quality study and, since breastfeeding is the recommended infant feeding practice, it is appropriate to use the breastfed infant as the standard against which all other infants are compared (2). The WHO growth standards use values of 2 standard deviations away from the median to identify children whose growth might be indicative of adverse health conditions (1). The CDC Birth to 24 months growth charts (based on the WHO growth standards) labels 2 standard deviations above the median as the 97.7th percentile. Thus, an infant or child (< 24 months) is categorized as high weight-for-length when plotted at or above the 97.7th percentile, labeled as the 98th percentile on the CDC Birth to 24 months growth charts. The CDC recommends that all infants and children < 24 months be assessed using the CDC Birth to 24 months growth charts regardless of type of feeding (formula or breastfed) (2). (See Clarification for information about standard deviations and the cut- off used to determine high weight-for-length.) Implications for WIC Nutrition Services The WIC Program plays an important role in public health efforts to reduce the prevalence of obesity by actively identifying and enrolling infants and young children who may be at risk of overweight/obesity in later childhood or adolescence. When identifying this risk, it is important to communicate with parents/caregivers in a way that is supportive and nonjudgmental, and with a careful choice of words that convey an empathetic attitude and minimize embarrassment or harm to a child's self -esteem (4). In recognition of the importance of language, the 2007 American Medical Association Expert Committee Report recommends the use of more neutral terms such as weight disproportional to height, excess weight , and high weight-for-length when communicating with a parent/caregiver (5). Height and weight measurements are plotted on growth charts at each WIC certification. However, growth charts are meant to be used as a screening tool and comprise only one aspect of the overall growth assessment. A clinical assessment to determine if a child is at a healthy weight is more complex. Weight classification (derived from the growth chart) should be integrated with the growth pattern, familial obesity, medical risks, and dietary and physical activity habits to determine the child's obesity risk ( 3, 6). The goal in WIC nutrition counseling is to help the child achieve recommended rates of growth and development. WIC staff can frame the discussion to make achieving normal growth a shared goal of the WIC Program and the parent/caregiver. Studies have shown that the early childhood eating environment provides a great opportunity for preventive intervention (7) .

It shows how much variation there is from the median. The WHO growth charts use standard deviations to illustrate the proximity of a given child's growth from that of the average child of the same age and gender. For infants and children < 24 months of age, 2 standard deviations above the median indicates high weight-for-length. A measurement of 2 standard deviations below the median indicates underweight. Since most health care providers in the U.S. are more familiar with percentiles, the CDC developed growth charts based on the WHO growth standards, but converted standard deviations into percentile readings. Two standard deviations above the median is the 97.7th percentile; however, for ease of use, CDC labels it as the 98th percentile on the hard copy Birth to 24 months growth charts. Electronic charts should use the 97.7th percentile as the cut-off. 6/ 2018 1 of 6 131 Anthropometric: Low Maternal Weight Gain 131 Low Maternal Weight Gain Definition/C ut-off Value Low maternal weight gain is defined as follows: 1. A low rate of weight gain, such that in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters, for singleton pregnancies (1,2) : Prepregnancy Weight Classification BMI Total Weight Gain (lbs.)/Week Underweight < 18.5 < 1 Normal Weight 18.5 to 24.9 < 0.8 Overweight 25.0 to 29.9 < 0.5 Obese >30.0 < 0.4 Multi-fetal Pregnancies See Justification for more information. Note: A BMI table is attached to assist in determining weight classifications. Also, until research supports the use of different BMI cut-offs to determine weight categories for adolescent pregnancies, the same BMI cut- offs will be used for all women, regardless of age, when determining WIC eligibility. (See Justification for a more detailed explanation.) 2. Low weight gain at any point in pregnancy, such that using a National Academies of Sciences, Medicine, and Engineering (NASEM - formerly known as the Institute of Medicine) -based weight gain grid, a pregnant woman's weight plots at any point beneath the bottom line of theappropriate weight gain range for her respective prepregnancy weight category as follows (1,2) : Prepregnancy Weight Classification BMI Total Weight Gain Range (lbs .) Underweight < 18.5 28-40 Normal Weight 18.5 to 25.0 to 29.9 15-25 Obese 30.0 11-20 Multi-fetal Pregnancies See Justification for more information. Note : A BMI table is attached to assist in determining weight classifications. Also, until research supports the use of different BMI cut-offs to determine weight categories for adolescent pregnancies, the same BMI cut- offs will be used for all women, regardless of age, when determining WIC eligibility. (See Justification for a more detailed explanation.) 6/2018 131 2 of 6 Anthropometric: Low Maternal Weight Gain Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Pregnant I Justification The amount of weight gained during pregnancy has both immediate and long term implications for both mother and infant. In the short term, m aternal weight gain during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters is an important determinant of fetal growth. In fact, l ow maternal weight gain is associated with an increased risk of small for gest ational age (SGA) infants especially in underwe ight and normal -weight women. Moreover , it is associated with preterm birth among underweight women and , to a lesse r extent , normal weight women . Low maternal weight gain is also associated with failure to in itiate breastfeeding . (1) In the long term, e vidence shows that poor maternal nutrition during pregnancy can have permanent, detrimental effects on the child's health in later years. These effects include an increased risk for obesity, impaired glucose tolera nce, and cardiovascular disease. Research suggests that early gestation may be a particularly sensitive period wherein inadequate weight gain can have long term impacts on the cardiometabolic hea lth of the child later in life. This most likely results from suboptimal maternal nutrition that affects developing fetal organs thereby leading to permanent alterations . (3) Nationally representative data indicates that inadequate gestational weight gain is most prevalent among Asian, Hispanic, and black mothers. Furthermore, a multivariable -adjusted analysis of >52,000 women who participated in the 2004- 2005 P regnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring S ystem confirmed that Hispanic, black, and women who identified as \"other\" regarding race gain significantly less weight than white women after adjusting for pre -pregnancy BMI, age, parity, and education (4). Reports of multivariable-adjusted analyses of both national studies and smaller cohorts since 1980 confirm that black and Hispanic women compared to white women are more likely to have inadequate weight gain as opposed to ex cessive gestational weight gain (4). Research shows that black women in the U.S. are more likely to gain less than the recommended amount of weight during pregnancy and more likely to lose weight during pregnancy compared to white women (5). Contributing factors include the decreased access that socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods have to vital resources that he lp ensure the good health of the mothe r prior to and during pregnancy. Additionally, place of work and exposure to other harmful environments are also factors (6). The 2009 NASEM prenatal weight gain recommendations based on prepregnancy weight stat us cat egories are associated with improved maternal and child health outcomes (1). Included in the se guidelines is the recommendation that the BMI weight categories used for adult women be used for pregnant adolescents as well. More research is needed to deter mine whether special categories are needed for adolescents. It is recognized that the NASEM cut-offs for defining weight categories will classify some adolescents differently than the CDC BMI-for- age charts. For the purpose of WIC eligibility determinati on, the NASEM cut-offs will be used for all women regardless of age. However, due to the lack of research on relevant BMI cut- offs for pregnant and postpartum adolescents, professionals should use all of the tools available to them to assess an individual 's anthropometric status and tailor nutrition counseling accordingly. 6/ 2018 3 of 6 131 Anthropometric: Low Maternal Weight Gain Multi- fetal Pregnancies F or twin gestations, the NASEM recommendations provide provisional guidelines as follows: normal weight women should gain 37 -5 4 pounds; overweight women, 31 -50 pounds; and obese women, 25 -42 pounds. There was insufficient information for the NASEM committe e to develop even provisional guidelines for underweight women with multiple fetuses (1). However, a consistent rate of weight gain is advisable. A gain of 1.5 pounds per week during the second and third trimesters has been associated with a reduced risk of preterm and low -bi rth weight delivery in twin pregnancy (7). In triplet pregnancies, the overall gain should be around 50 pounds with a steady rate of gain of approximately 1.5 pounds per week throughout the pregnancy (7). Education by the WIC nutrit ionist should address a steady rate of weight gain that is higher than for singleton pregnancies. For WIC nutrition risk assignment, multi -f etal pregnancies are considered a nutrition risk in and of themselves (see Risk 335 - MultiFetal Gestation ), aside from weight gain. W eight Loss during Pregnancy Weight loss during pregnancy can result in SGA infants, stillbirth, and neonatal death (8). In addition, surviving children are at risk for poor growth and infection during infancy. Weight loss during pregnancy may indicate underlying dietary or health practices. It may also indicate underlying health or social cond itions associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. Common causes of unintended weight loss during pregnancy include food insecurity, substance misuse, housing insecurity, infection, food- borne illness, and symptoms associated with pregnancy such as hyperemesis gravidarum (9). Please refer to Risk 301 - Hyperemesis Gravi darum for additional information. Weight Loss during Pregnancy in Obese Women The recommended amount of weight gain in obese women during pregnancy remains controversial (10). Researc h demonstrates that it may be beneficial for the mother, and not harmful for the infant, to lose weight during pregnancy. The benefits of weight loss amo ng obese pregnant women include decreased rates of caesarian delivery, large-for-gestational- age infan ts, and postpartum weight retention (11). As a result, some scientists are now suggesting that the NASEM recommendations for weight gain in obese pregnant women be re -evaluated (12). Although controversy remains regarding weight loss during pregnancy among obese women, if a pregnant woman was obese prior to pregnancy, she should follow the advice of her health care provider regarding weight recommendations. For WIC nutrition risk assignments, WIC staff should follow the NASEM recommendations. Implications for WIC Nutrition Services WIC services can improve the birth outcomes for women who experience low maternal weight gain during pregnancy. These outcomes can be improved by the supplemental food, nutrition education, and referrals provided to participa nts by the WIC Program. The WIC food prescription helps provide pregnant women with foods that reflect their nutr itional needs during pregnancy. The tailored nutrition education given to pregnant women helps ensure that they receive nutrition support tha t is relevant to their concerns and lifestyle factors. Staff can assist pregnant women in the following ways: Carefully assessing the health status, dietary intake, and concerns of the woman in a participant - centered manner to find out possible factors c ontributing to low weight gain .6/2018 131 4 of 6 Anthropometric: Low Maternal Weight Gain Encouraging women to eat smaller, more frequent meals with snacks if they are struggling with appetite or nausea . Di scussing healthy, high calorie snack options, if appropriate. To include nutrition tailoring of the food package for higher caloric WIC foods, e.g., peanut butter instead of legumes. Educating pregnant women on the importance of appropriate weight gain during pregnancy. If allowable, providing pregnant women with medical foods as prescribed by their medical providerto support appropriate weight gain.

Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I NonBreastfeeding Women III, IV, V or VI Justification Women with excessive gestational weight gains are at increased risk for cesarean delivery and delivering large for gestational age infants that can secondarily lead to complications during labor and delivery. There is a strong association between higher maternal weight gain and both postpartum weight retention and subsequent maternal obesity. High maternal weight gain may be associated with gluco se abnormalities and gestational hypertension disorders, but the evidence is inconclusive (1). Childhood obesity is one of the most important longterm health outcomes related to high maternal weight gain. A number of epidemiologic studies show that high maternal weight gain is associated with childhood obesity as measured by BMI (1). The 2009 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report: Weight Gain During Pregnancy: Reexamining the Guidelines (1)updated the pregnancy weight categories to conform to the categories developed by the World Health Organization and adopted by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in 1998 (2). The reexaminati on of the guidelines consisted of a review of the determinants of a wide range of shortand longterm consequences of variation in weight gain during pregnancy for both the mother and her infant. The IOM prenatal weight gain recommendations based on prepregnancy weight status categories are associated with improved maternal and child health outcomes (1) . Included in the 2009 IOM guidelines is the recommendation that the BMI weight categories used for adult women be used for pregnant adolescents as well. More research is needed to determine whether special categories are needed for adolescents. It is recognized that the IOM cutoffs for defini ng wei ght categories will classify some adolescents differently than the CDC BMIforage charts. For the purpose of WIC eligibility determination, the IOM cutoffs will be used for all women regardless of age. However, due to the lack of research on relevant BMI cutoffs for pregnant and postpartu m adolescents, professionals should use all of the tools available to them to assess these applicants' anthropometric status and tailor nutrition counseling accordingly. For twin gestations, the 2009 IOM recommendations provide provisional guidelines: normal weight women should gain 3754 pounds; overweight women, 3150 pounds; and obese women, 2542 pounds. Ther e was insufficient information for th e IOM committee to develop even provisional guidelines for underweight women with multiple fetuses (1). However, a consistent rate of weight gain is advisable. A gain of 1.5 pounds per week during the second and third trimesters has been associated with a reduced risk of preterm and lowbirth weight delivery in twin pre gnancy (3). In triplet pregnancies the overall gain should be 06 /2010 3 of 4 133 Anthropometric: High Maternal Weight Gainaround 50 pounds with a steady rate of gain of approximately 1.5 pounds per week throughout the pregnancy (3). Education by the WIC nutritionist should address a steady rate of weight gain that is higher than for singleton pregnancies. For WIC eligibility determinations, multifetal pregnancies are considered a nutrition risk in and of thems elves (Risk #335 , Multi Fetal Gestation), aside from the weight gain issue. The supplemental foods, nutrition education, and counseling related to the weight gain guidelines provided by the WIC Program may improve maternal weight status and infant outcomes (4). In addition, WIC nutritionists can play an important role, through nutrition educ ation and physical activity promotion, in assisting postpartum women achieve and maintain a healthy weight.

NIH Publication No. 984083. 12/2020 1 of 5 134 Anthropometric: Failure to Thrive 134 Failure to Thrive Definition /Cut -off Value Presence of failure to thrive (FTT) diagnosed, documented, or reported by a physician or someone working under a physician's orders, or as self -reported by applicant/participant/caregiver. See Clarification for more information about self -reporting a diag nosis. Note: For premature infants with a diagnosis of FTT please see risk #142 Preterm or Early Term Delivery for instructions on adjusting for gestational age when plotting anthropometric measurements on growth charts . Participant Category and Priority L evel Category Priority Infants I Children III Justification Failure to thrive (FTT) describes an inadequate growth pattern where growth is significantly lower than what is expected for age and sex (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Typically a sign of undernutrition, the cause of FTT is often complex and includes many factors. FTT in infants and children can increase the risk of long -term growth and cognitive problems, among other concerns (4, 5). Some of the indicators that a health care provider might use to diagn ose FTT include the following: Weight -for-age repeatedly below the 2.3 rd percentile for infants/children younger than 2 years or repeatedly below the 5 th percentile for children 2 years and older (2, 3, 5) Weight -for-length repeatedly below the 2.3 rd percentile for infants/children younger than 2 years or Body Mass Index (BMI) repeatedly below the 5 th percentile for chil dren 2 years and older (2, 3, 5) Stature -for-age consistently below the 2.3 rd percentile for infants/children younger than 2 years or repeatedly below 5 th percentile for children 2 years and older (3, 5) Weight less than 75% of median (\"typical\") weight -for-age (3 ) Weight less than 80% of median weight -for-stature (3) Progressive fall -off in weight -for-age, weight -for-stature, and/or stature -for-age, that crosses down two major percentile lines (2, 3, 4) Rate of weight gain less than the 5th percentile based on World Health Organization velocity standards (3) It is recommended that a combination of growth criteria be considered and that growth be assessed over time, rather than using a single measurement (4). It is useful to note that reduced weight -for-stature can be a strong indicator of recent undernutrition, while low weight -for-age can represent both current and long -term nutrition concerns. Stature takes a longer time to be impacted by malnutrition; therefore, reduced stature may indicate the cumulative effects of chronic malnutrit ion (5). 12/2020 134 2 of 5 Anthropometric: Failure to Thrive In the United States, FTT is diagnosed in about 5 -10% of infants and children in outpatient settings and about 3 -5% of those in hospitals. Highest rates are found among lower income rural and urban communities. Failure to thrive often manifests early in life; most infants and children with FTT are diagnosed before 18 months of age. (4) Several stressors may interact with each other to eventually lead to FTT. Undernutrition , as a result of a variety of medical, nutritional or developmental issues , is a major cause and includes the infant/child not being offered adequate calories/nutrients, the infant/child not taking the offered foods/beverages, inadequate calorie/nutrient absorption, and /or excessive calorie expenditure. (4, 5) The following tab le includes factors that can contribute to undernutrition and increase the risk for FTT in infants and children (2, 3, 4, 5): Medical/ Nutritional/ Developmental Behavioral / Feeding Practices * Environmental/ General c onditions: Prematurity , low birth weight , and small for gestational age Exposure to substances in utero Any chronic medical condition Inadequate i ntake , which can be caused by: Neurological disorders Developmental delays, including autism spectrum disorders Dental problems including cleft lip, cleft palate, and dental caries Enlarged tonsils or adenoids Feeding problems including insufficient or ineffective breast milk transfer , weak suck, swallowing problems, and poor appetite Gastrointestinal prob lems, including gastroesophageal reflux, frequent vomiting, and constipation Chronic or frequent infections (These can lead to reduced intake, which can further compromise the immune system, thus contributing to additional infections and FTT.) Lead poisoni ng (This can lead to anorexia, constipation, and abdominal pain. Reduced intake can then lead to calcium and iron Infrequent feeding or not appropriately responding to hunger cues Poor caregiver - infant/child interactions, especially when feeding Inappropriate feeding based on infant/child's stage of development Improper breastfeeding positioning or technique Incorrect preparation of infant for mula Excessive fluids other than breastmilk/formula for infants Once foods are started, not providing appropriate support (such as a high chair) while eating For children, inconsistent timing of feeding or allowing to graze on food/beverages throughout da y Poverty, food insecurity, and homelessness Caregiver's lack of knowledge about appropriate nutrition and feedi ng Caregiver with limited ability to make appropriate feeding decisions/prepare food, including those with a mental health disorder, intellectual disability, or substance use disorder \u00a7 Family stressors such as unemployment, separation, or incarceration Inadequate access to appropriate foods , including culturally preferred foods 12/2020 3 of 5 134 Anthropometric: Failure to Thrive Medical/ Nutritional/ Developmental Behavioral / Feeding Practices * Environmental/ Psychosocial deficiencies, further exacerbating the lead poisoning and FTT.) Inadequate a bsorption , which can be caused by : Food allergies and lactose into lerance Celiac disease Gastrointestinal problems, including chronic diarrhea or vomiting and malformations Protein -losing enteropathy Pancreatic conditions, including c ystic errors of metabolism Excessive caloric e xpenditure , which can be caused by : Congenital heart disease or heart failure Chronic pulmonary disease Hyperthyroidism Chronic or frequent infections Inflammatory diseases, including asthma and inflammatory bowel diseases Malignancy Renal disease Restrictive diet, including vegan, low - fat, or food allergy - related Feeding in a chaotic household with multiple caregivers Neglect or abuse *See risk #411 Inappropriate Nutrition Practices for Infants and risk #425 Inappropriate Nutrition Practices for Children for more information about nutrition and feeding practices.

Failure to thrive in infants/children, especially when severe or prolonged, can have several harmful effects, including the following: Dehydration and nutr ient deficiencies Compromised immune system and increased risk of infections (5) Increased susceptibility to lead poisoning (when calcium and iron deficiencies are present) (5) 12/2020 134 4 of 5 Anthropometric: Failure to Thrive Long -term impaired cognitive development, including learning difficulties (4, 5 ) Long -term problems with socioemotional development (4, 5) Long -term lower than average weight and/or height (4) Treatment The goal of FTT treatment is to achieve optimal growth while also addressing whatever factors may be contributing to the FTT. Catch -up growth (growth at a faster rate than normal for age) is usually necessary; according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, a typical catch -up rate is 2 -3 times the average weight gain for age (2, 3, 5). As treatment progresses, the rate of catch -up gr owth is continually adjusted as needed until growth is deemed appropriate. Thus, growth must be measured frequently and assessed over time (5). It is also important to watch for relapse, as a history of FTT is associated with reoccurrence of FTT in the f uture (2). During treatment, close follow -up by the health care provider and other health professionals is crucial. A multidisciplinary approach is often used, including collaboration among the family, pediatrician, dietitian, developmental therapist, an d others. Nutrition therapy is a core component of treatment, starting with nutrition assessment. A comprehensive assessment should take the following into account: feeding history, current intake , breastfeeding/formula - feeding, the caregiver -infant/child feeding relationship, feeding timing/environment, and nutrition knowledge/beliefs. Nutrition and breastfeeding counseling are individualized to the infant/child and typically focus on increasing consumption of calories, protein, and micronutrients (5). The health care provider may also suggest providing a multivitamin that includes the Recommended Dietary Allowance for all vitamins, iron, and zinc during the period of rapid growth, as well as additional iron or vitamin D if there are deficiencies (5). If behavioral interventions are not effective, treatment providers may recommend nutritional/caloric supplements be given for a limited time to achieve catch -up growth. These include supplemental formula for breastfed infants, high calorie/concentrated fo rmulas for infants, and high calorie beverage supplements for children. If treatment is not effective, hospitalization may be needed, though this is rare. This may occur if the infant/child has a severe safety or health risk, including having a serious i nfection, medical condition, malnourishment, or dehydration (2, 5). Implications for WIC Nutrition Services WIC staff can provide the following nutrition services to infants and children with failure to thrive: Learn about and reinforce the health care team's plan of care for treating the participant's FTT. Encourage caregivers to keep all health care appointments. Offer breastfeeding support to breastfeeding dyads. Refer to the WIC Designated Breastfeeding Expert, if available, or other professional bre astfeeding support when needed. Offer participant -centered nutrition counseling based on a thorough assessment and on caregiver's concerns and interests. Suggestions to caregivers may include the following, based on the situation: o Increasing children's intake of calorically -dense food o Correctly preparing infant formula 12/2020 5 of 5 134 Anthropometric: Failure to Thrive o Reducing volume of fluids consumed , if excessive, to appropriate amounts (other than breastmilk or formula for infants) o Allowing children to choose how much and which foods to eat (from wh at is offered) o Feeding children at consistent times and not allowing child to graze on foods and beverages throughout the day o Feeding in a supportive setting (such as a table or highchair) and in a distraction -free environment Provide individualized food p ackages, tailored to meet the increased nutritional needs of the infant/child. Reinforce the importance of following recommended vaccination schedules, as FTT is sometimes associated with a compromised immunize system. Offer individualized referrals based on the household's needs and interests, including referrals to financial assistance, food assistance, cooking classes, housing, transportation, childcare, adult education/career services, and substance use services. Consider referrals that promote a nurtur ing, responsive caregiver -infant/child relationship, including those to local home visiting programs, parenting programs, and early intervention services.

A self -reported medical diagnosis (\"My doctor says that I have/my son or daughter has...\") should prompt the CPA to validate the presence of the condition by asking more pointed questions related to that diagnosis. 6/2016 1 o f 6 135 Anthropometric: Slowed/Faltering Growth Pattern 135 Slow ed/Faltering Growth Pattern Definition/Cut -off Value Slow ed/Faltering Growth is defined as: Age Cut-Off Value Infants Birth to 2 Weeks Exce ssive weight loss after birth, defined as > 7 % birth weight (1, 2). Infants 2 weeks to 6 Months of Age Any weight loss . Use two separate weight measurements taken at least eight weeks apart (3). Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Infants < 6 Months of Age I Justification Growth faltering is defined as a growth rate below that which is appropriate for an infant 's age and sex. It can effect length , weight, and head circumferences resulting in values lower than expected . Growth faltering may include weight faltering ( a drop in w eigh t-for-age) or slowed g rowth where both weight and length growth are slower than expected . An example of weight faltering is a drop in weight after a minor illness or a measurement/plotting erro r (4). Growth in infants is steady and predictable. It is a reflection of health and nutritional status and the overwhelming majority of infants have no growth problems ( 5, 6). Normal growth is also pulsatile, with periods of rapid growth or growth spurt s followed by periods of slower or no measurable growth ( 5-8). Catch -up and catch- down growth during early childhood are normal phenomena that affect large numbers of children, particularly during infancy, and may merely be an adjustment to the genetic potential for growth ( 9). Growth is also seasonal, with length velocities (the change in growth over time) increased during the spring and summer months and stagnant other months ( 10). Weight may vary depending on the time of day and infant feeding schedule. Growth may be increased or slowed by a variety of conditions, with changes in growth as the first sign of a pathological condition. Such conditions include: undernutrition, hypothyroidism, iron deficiency, human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV), inborn errors of metabolism, lead toxicity, zinc deficiency, immune deficiency, failure of a major organ system such as the gastro intestinal digestive system , renal, cardiovascular, and pulmonary ( 11). Infants that do not follow a steady predictable pattern , such as those with short stature or decreased growth rate , should be the focus of concern ( 11). The timely detection of poor growth in early life is a way to identify infants who may be at risk for growth faltering, and intervene before undernutrition has detrimental health outcomes, such as growth retardation, when incurred early are irreversible ( 12). It can help prevent short stature and adverse functional and deleterious long term consequences, such as poor cognition and educational performance, low adult wages, lost productivity, and when accompanied by weight gain later in childhood, an increas ed risk of nutrition -related chronic diseases ( 13, 14). 06/2016 135 2 of 6 Anthropometric: Slowed/Faltering Growth Pattern Excessive Weight Loss After Birth Infant weight loss in the early postpartum period is physiologically normal, and nearly universal but the amount of weight loss varies (15). Weight loss of 5% and 7 % of birth weight is not unusual for formula -fed or breastfed infants, respectively (16). Healthy infants are expected to regain their birth weight within 8 -10 days after birth ( 17). However, if a breastfed infant loses 7% of birth weight in the first 72 hours after birth, an evaluation and review of the mother -infant dyad is needed and any problems resolved immediately. Risk of dehydration and failure to thrive in breastfed newborns can be mitigated by early screening and providing lactation support in the early postpartum period (18). A weight loss of up to 10% of birth weight is the maximum acceptable weight loss for newborn infants, with any additional loss a potential emergency ( 17, 1 9). Contributing factors include (2, 16, 17, 20) : Hospital practices like epidurals, pacifier use, low or non -nutritive feedings, or strict feedin g s chedules . Maternal factors such as retained placenta, parity, anxie ty, and poor maternal knowledge . Infant factors such as birth weight, gestational a ge, gender, and feeding method . Breastfed infants with poor positioning, latch and/or milk transfer. WIC staff should identify and address any potential underlying feeding issues causing newborn weight loss (21). An infant with a weight l oss of greater or equal to seven percent signals the need for careful evaluation and intervention, infants with a weight loss of ten percent or more is a marker for a medical referral ( 22). Any Weight Loss 2 Weeks to 6 Months While the 2006 CDC/WHO growth charts show slower growth from 3 - 18 months of age as a normal growth pattern , weight loss is not expected beyond the first two weeks of life and requires follow -up (23). After birth, growth faltering is caused by inadequate caloric intake, normal caloric intake in an environment of ex cessive loss or malabsorption; or increased metabolic needs. In cases of dehydration or acute illnesses like gastroenteritis, fluid loss that exceeds fluid intake may also lead to significant weight loss. Weight loss in young infants is commonly caused by acute infections, feeding problems, allergy to milk protein, lead poisoning, HIV, malnutrition, pyloric stenosis, gastrointestinal reflux, celiac disease, cystic fibrosis, neglect, growth failure, congenital heart disease, and inborn errors of metabolism . The primar y goal of the intervention is to enhance infant health outcomes by address ing causes of slowed growth and keep ing vulnerable infants tracking along growth percentiles established in infancy. In some cases, it may be important to intervene quickly, while in other cases a period of frequent growth monitoring would be more appropriate to prevent too rapid refeeding and subsequent increased risk of type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease later in life ( 24, 25). If faltering growth is suspected , maternal neglect and in adequate caloric intake due to inappropriate formula mixing, breastfeeding problems , early introduction of solid food, maternal depression, and emotional deprivation, must be ruled out and addressed (6 ). Growth monitoring should occur on a monthly basis - utilizing two separate weight measurements taken at least eight week s apart as data marke rs. It is imperative that WIC staff involved in measuring infant growth use standardized equipment and receive adequate t raining prior to conducting infant measurements to increase reliability between measures (26 ). If the participant does not respond to nutritional management (i.e. weight continues to falter) or if other 6/2016 3 o f 6 135 Anthropometric: Slowed/Faltering Growth Pattern markers falter (such as length for age or stagnant head circumference), then the infant shoul d be referred to their health care provider for assessment. Normal Growth Patterns Understanding normal growth patterns in infants is important. The pattern of weight gain during infancy varies depe nding on the met hod of feeding. Compared to formula -fed infants, breastfed infants gain weight rapidly in the first three to four months of life and relatively slowly thereafter. Although the weights of formula -fed and breastfed infants are similar by one to two years of age, the typical pattern of slowed weight gain after three to four months among breastfed infants may lead to unnecessary early introduction of solid foods or cessation of breastfeeding if the slowed weight gain is perceived as lactational inadequacy. (27, 28, 29) The table below shows the average mean values for weight gain for health y exclusively breastfed infants: Average Of Mean Values for Gains in Weight for Hea lthy Exclusively Breastfed Infants (30) Interval (mo) Girls (g/day) Boys (g/day) 0-1 30 33 1-2 28 34 2-3 22 23 3-4 19 20 4-5 15 16 5-6 13 14 6-7 12 11 Screening for Slow or Faltering Growth P atterns Screening for slow or faltering growth patterns is a preventive health measure which requires careful growth monitoring and critical thinking skills. And while a single measure of weight -for-age may be cause for concern, it cannot be interpreted to show growth faltering. No single measurement on its own is adequate for identify ing nutritional grow th delay (31 ). As stated earlier, i t is imperative that WIC staff involved in measuring infant growth use standardized equipment and receive adequate training prior to conducting infant measurements to increase reliability between measures (26 ). Growth faltering is a reflection of two weight measures, preferably eight weeks (two months) apart, to calculate an increment in growth. It is possible to use four week (one month) intervals for the assessment of slow growth patterns, but since there may be errors in clinical measurement, it is more prudent to use eight weeks as the minimum time interval between measurements. Infant weight will fluctuate over the course of the day and length growth may occur in discrete periods lasting no more than 24 hours separated by growth -free intervals lasting as long as two months. Thus, growth that seems abnormal may be nothing more than a growth -free period in a child's life (10). 06/2016 135 4 of 6 Anthropometric: Slowed/Faltering Growth Pattern Screening for early growth failure should be done using multiple growth indicators, including risks for underweight (Risk #103), short stature (Risk #121), failure to thrive (Risk #134) and low head circumference (Risk #152) to allow for timely remedial interventions and prevention of further growth failure. In summary, a three -step approach should be considered for evaluation of infants with suspected abnormal growth. First, growth data should be assessed for accuracy. Second, feeding problems, improper formula preparation, etc. should be assessed to determine if calorie intake is insufficient for growth and development. Third , the infant should be assessed for other medical conditions or developmental delay. Implications for WIC Services In most situations, growth may not simply be a factor of undernutrition, but rather a combination of environmental and other factors which will require a broad intervention strategy for successful health outcomes ( 32). In general, intervention strategies may include screening for environmental health factors such as (25, 32): Adequate nutrition and nutrient dense foods, including a history of human milk or formula feeding . Appropriate introduction of comple mentary foods. Maternal conditions that impact lactation performance : mastitis, prolonged labor, C -Section, hypo or hyperthyroidism, Diabetes, low birth weight infant, routine and eating/feeding behavior . Growth faltering in light of familial growth patterns . Neglect . Lack of social support . Adverse social and psychological en vironment . Depressed or poor mental abilities of parent/caregiver . It may manifest as d ressin g i nappropriately for the weather; looking disheveled and lacking in hygiene; or making inappropriate faces or reactions like laughing. Lack of parental ed ucatio n and nutrition knowledge. Nutrition counseling for this risk would ideally be provided by staff with specialized education and training to assess growth parameters and identify causative factors accurately. Intervention strategies to address this criterion include: Appropriate timing and type of participant intervention. Effective participant -centered nutrition counseling . Early postpartum breastfeeding support to minimiz e risk of dehydration and/or failure to thrive. Review of baby behavior hunger and s atiety cues. (For more information see WIC Baby Behavior Basics, WIC Online Learning Module available on the WIC Work s Resource System: https://wicworks.fns.usda.gov/wic- learning -online .) Review/adjustment of formula mixing technique . 6/2016 5 o f 6 135 Anthropometric: Slowed/Faltering Growth Pattern Referral to lact ation specialist for latch and position assistance . Tailored food package prescription . Review a ccuracy of weight, length , and head circumference measurements . Referral to allied health professionals such as: physician, early childhood intervention, socia l services, and home visiting program. A variety of intervention strategies can help infants establish and maint ain individual growt h patterns. The desired outcome is one where the infant's own growth curve tracks within the channel established in early infancy . Also, because growth monitoring is an intervention that happens largely after the fact, there may be benefit to anticipatory guidance that provides prevention rather than crisis management of this problem (33). It is suggest ed that when feeding is going well, the baby will eat as much as she needs and grow in the way that is right for her if parents maintain a divisio n of responsibility in feeding (34).

Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW) Birth weight defined as < 3 pounds 5 ounces ( < 1500 g), for infants and children less than 24 months. Note: See \"Guidelines for Growth Charts and Gestational Age Adjustment for Low Birth Weight and Very Low Birth Weight Infants\" (FNS Policy Memorandum 98 -9, Revision 7, April 2004) for more information about the anthropometric assessment and nutritional ca re of LBW and VLBW infants. Participant Category and Priority L evel Category Priority Infants I Children < 24 months III Justification Low birth weight is one of the most important biologic predictors of infant death and deficiencies in physical and mental development during childhood among those babies who survive and continues to be a strong predictor of growth in early childhood. Infants and children born with LBW/VLBW, particularly if caused by fetal growth restriction, need an optimal nutrient intake to survive, meet the needs of an extended period of relatively rapid postnatal growth, and complete their growth and development (1).

Early Term: Delivery of an infant born 37 0/7 and 38 6/7 weeks gestation . Note: See Clarification section for information on plotting growth measurements for preterm infants. Participant Category and Priority L evel Category Priority Infants I Children < 24 months III Justification Preterm birth is a significant cause of newborn morbidity and mortality. Preterm and early term deliveries strain society's healthcare resources due to the longer hospital stays for the infant and the long- term effects on t he health of the newborn (3 , 4). Typically , a pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks. Premature or preterm birth, however, is defined as a birth that occurs between 20 and 37 weeks of pregnancy, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) ( 5). In the past, the period from 3 weeks before until 2 weeks after the estimated date of delivery was considered a \"term\" pregnancy, with the expectation that a baby would have similar health outcomes if they were born any time duri ng this interval. In 2013, ACOG released a committee opinion that the label \"term\" should be replaced with the designations early term (37 0/7 weeks and 38 6/7 weeks gestation) and full term (39 0/7 weeks and 40 6/7 weeks gestation) to more accurately describe these groups of infants (1). Preterm Delivery Prematurity affects about 12% of all live births in the U.S. , and a bout 50% of these preterm births w ere preceded by preterm labor (6). In 2011, the annual rate of premature births in the United States reached 11.7%, nearly two times the rate in European nations ( 6). Preterm births also account for approximately 70% of newborn deaths and 36% of infant deaths (5). Several factors have been found to increase the risk of preterm delivery. Epidemiol ogical studies have consistently reported low socioeconomic status, nonwhite race, maternal age of 18 years or 40 years, and low pre -pregnancy weight as risk factors. A history of one previous preterm birth is associated with a recurrent risk of 17 -37%; the risk increases with the number of prior preterm births and decreases with the number of term deliveries. Other maternal factors associated with a risk of preterm birth may include l ow weight gain during pregnancy, maternal obesity, hypertension, di abetes, or sexually transmitted diseases (7). (See risk 311 History of Preterm or Early Term Delivery for more details.) 05/2017 142 2 of 7 Anthropometric : Preterm or Early Term Delivery Despite advances in neonatal care, preterm birth remains a leading cause of infant death in the United States (8). Pre term infant s may have health problems because their organs did not have enough time to develop in the womb . Babies that are born too early may have a number of health conditions, including : Low or very low birth weigh t (9) Increased caloric needs (9) Feeding difficulties due to a lack of reflexes for sucking and swallowing ( 9) Immature digestion and impaired absorption of carbohydrates and lipids ( 10, 11) Breathing problems like chronic lung disease/ bronchopulmonary dysplasia and apnea ( 9, 12, 13) Cerebral palsy , an impairment of the brain that controls movement and muscle tone ( 10, 14) Developmental delay and poorer cognitive function (12, 15, 16, 17) Vision problems like retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), which may cause blindness (12, 15) Hearing problems (12) Behavioral problems and psychiatric disorders ( 16, 17) Increased r isk for n ecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) due to their immature gastrointestinal systems (10, 12) Increased risk for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) ( 10) Temperature control problems ( 9, 10) Heart problems like patent ductus arteriosus and low blood pressure (hypotension) ( 10, 12) Blood problems like anemia and jaundice ( 10, 13) Hypoglycemia ( 9, 10) Immature immune system s, which may result in infections ( 9) Preterm infants often need special medical care in a neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) and may need to stay there for days or even months . Breastfeeding is recommended as the normative standard for infant feeding and nutrition for all infants , especially preterm babies. Breastfeeding preterm infants has been associated with positive health outcomes for these infants, including: Improved motor maturity and cognitive ability (18, 19, 20) R educed risk of NEC ( 21, 22) Reduced risk of ROP and retinal detachment (23) Additionally, m others of preterm infants produce milk that is designed to meet the baby's particular nutritional needs during the first few weeks of life . It is higher in protein and minerals, such as salt, and contains different types of fat that are easier to digest and absorb compared to fats in the milk of mothers of full term babies . The fat in human milk also helps to enhance the development of the baby's brain and neurologic tissues, which is especially important for premature infants. Human milk is also easier for babies to digest than infant formula and avoids exposing the baby's immature intestinal lining to the cow's milk proteins found in premature infant formula. Preterm infants who are breastfed are less likely to develop 05/2017 3 o f 7 142 Anthropometric: Preterm or Early Term Delivery intestinal infections than babies who are formula fed, and the colostrum produced in the first few days contains high concentrations of antibodies that will help the baby fight infection (22). Breastfeeding preterm infants, especially if they are in the NICU, may present unique challenges for breastfeeding dyads . These mothers will benefit from extra breastfeeding support due to t he delay of direct breastfeeding , reliance on breast pumps, and the stress of having a sick newborn . Even if the baby cannot breastfeed direct ly from the breast at first , the mother can be encouraged to express her milk to ensure that her supply is maintained. Supportive care for infants in the NICU may include the use of a feeding tube . Expressed human milk can be passed through the tube , therefore, it is important for the mother to discuss her feeding decisions with her baby's doctor . Preterm infants sometimes need additional calories and nutrients to facilitate adequate growth , and in such cases a human milk fortifier may be prescribed by a health care provider (2 2). Preterm infants who are not breastfed may require the use of a formula higher in calories and nutrients to support their growth. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP) , soy formulas are typically not recommend ed for low birth weight preterm infants , as their use may result in less weight gain and lower serum albumin and phosphorus levels than cow's milk -based formulas (24). In addition to breastfeeding, s kin-to-skin care or kangaroo care (holding your baby naked or in just a diaper on your bare chest ), can help preterm infants breathe better, gain weight, keep their body at the right temperature, and prepare them for breastfeeding (25). All caregivers can provide skin -to-skin care, not just the mother. Infants born at 34 0/7 through 36 6/7 weeks gestation, called late preterm infants, are sometimes mistaken for term infants since their size and weight may be similar (10). However, caregivers, healthcare providers , nutritionists, and lactation consultants must be aware that these babies are physiologically and metabolically immature ( 9). In addition to the health conditions previously mentioned for preterm infants , it is important to be aware that late preterm babies have an increased risk of morbidity and mort ality which is often related to feeding problems . Due to their immaturity, late preterm infants may have more challenges with breastfeeding because they tire easily and have less stamina , which results in greater difficulty with latching, sucking, and swallowing. Mothers of late preterm infants will benefit greatly from timely lactation assessment and support since feeding difficulties, slow weight gain, failure to thrive, hypoglycemia, and jaundice are very common in these babies (2 6). Preterm infants have different patterns of growth compared to term infants. Plotting the growth of preterm infants using their adjusted gestational age is an essential component of care until they reach 24 to 36 months of age (2 7). (See the Clarification section for more information on how to determine adjusted gestational age.) Most preterm infants , however, show catch -up growth in weight, length, and head circumference after their initial postnatal growth failure. If catch -up growth occurs, it usually starts early in the first months of life and is often achieved within the first years of life (2 8). The effects of preterm birth can continue beyond infancy. Children who were born prematurely are at an increased risk for the following : Neurodevelopmental problems (2 9) Intellectual/cognitive impairments, which can lead to learning disabilities and the need for specialeducation services ( 29, 30, 31) Motor problems ( 31)05/2017 142 4 of 7 Anthropometric : Preterm or Early Term Delivery Feeding difficulties such as problems with chewing and swallowing, late development of feedin g s kills, food refusal, eating behavior problems, and poor appetite (32) Emotional problems such as anxiety and depression ( 31) Behavioral concerns such as attention problems and hyperactivity ( 31) Early Term Delivery Up to 10% of babies in the United States are scheduled for early term deliveries via labor -inducing medication or cesarean section before 39 weeks of gestation despite neither the mother nor the baby being at risk i f the pregnancy continues (4 ). Elective deliveries like this are sometimes requested for reasons such as wanting to schedule the date of the infant's birth, physician preference, or for relief of symptoms at the end of the pregnancy (4). Research shows that a fetus will experience a significant amount of development and growth of the lungs, brain, and liver between 37 and 39 weeks of gestation. The brain develops at its fastest rate at the end of the pregnancy, at a rate of up to one thir d between weeks 35 and 39. Additionally, layers of fat are added under the infant's skin during the last few weeks of pregnancy which helps them keep warm after birth . According to ACOG , non -medically warranted deliveries prior to 39 weeks should be avoi ded (33). Early term delivery puts an additional strain on society as the early term infant will likely require a longer hospital stay and may hav e long term healthcare needs (4 ). Implications for WIC Nutrition Services WIC services can directly support preterm and early term infants and their caregivers, as these babies may have unique feeding difficulties. Pre term delivery is often unexpected and a mother may not have made decisions about how to feed her baby yet . These infants may require additional calories , extra breastfeeding support, and/ or the use of a human milk fortifier or special infant formula . WIC can support preterm and early term infants and their caregivers through: Promoting and supporting breastfeeding as the normative standard for infant nutrition and providing early and frequent breastfeeding support . Recommending the use of a hospital grade electric breast pump for expressing milk if the baby is i n t he NICU or the baby is unable to breastfeed directly from the breast . Providing anticipatory guidance about potential feeding challenges. Encouraging caregiv ers to provide skin -to-skin contact . Providing education on safe preparation, handling, and storage of breast milk and/or formula. Educating pregnant women about the importance of carrying a baby to term, unless medicall y co ntraindicated . Monitoring the child's growth to ensure healthy weight gain. Provid ing nutrition education for mothers /caregivers and appropriate referral s as necessary for growth, feeding, health, and/or infa nt developmental issues . References 1.

Subtract the adjustment for prematurity in weeks from the child's chronological po stnatal age in weeks to determine the child's gestation -adjusted age. Example : Randy was born prematurely on March 19, 20 11. His gestational age at birth was determined to be 30 weeks based on ultrasonographic examination. At the time of the June 11, 201 1, clinic visit, his chronological postnatal age is 12 weeks. What is his gestation -adjusted age? 30 = gestational age in weeks 40 - 30 = 10 weeks adjustment for prematurity 12 - 10 = 2 weeks gestation -adjusted age His measurements would be plotted on a growth chart as a 2 -week -old infant. Note: Preterm infants (< 36 6/7 weeks gestation) who have not reached the equivalent age of 40 weeks gestation may be assessed for growth using a growth chart for low birth weight (LBW) or very low birth weight (V LBW) infants (e.g., Infant Health and Development Program [IHDP]) consistent with the protocols of the local medical community in which the WIC clinic operates. The CDC does not recommend the use of the CDC Growth Charts for preterm infants who have not reached the equivalent age of 40 weeks gestation. 04/2004 1 of 2 151 Anthropometric: Small for Gestational Age 151 Small for Gestational Age Definition/Cut-off Value Inf ants and children less than 24 months of age diagnosed as small for gestational age.

Participant Category and Priority L evel Category Priority Infants I Children < 24 months III Justification Impairment of fetal growth can have adverse effects on the nutrition and health of children during infancy and childhood, including higher mortality and morbidity, slower physical growth, and possibly slower mental development. Infants who are small for gestational age (SGA) are also more likely to have congenital abnormalities. Severely growth-retarded infants are at markedly increased risk for fetal and neonatal death, hypoglycemia, hypocalcaemia, polycythemia, and neurocognitive complications of pre- and intrapartum hypoxia. Over the long term, growth-retarded infants may have permanent mild deficits in growth and neurocognitive development (1). WIC staff should routinely complete anthropometric assessments and follow-up (to include coordination with and referral to, other health care providers and services) for infants/children with a diagnosis/history of SGA who have not yet demonstrated normal growth patterns.

See Clarification for more information about self-reporting a diagnosis. Participant Category and Priority L evel Category Priori ty Infants I Justification Infan t mortality rates are highe r among full-term infants who weigh greate r than 4,000 g (greate r than 9 lbs) than for infants weighin g between 3,000 and 4,000 g (6.6 and 8.8 lbs). Oversized infants are usually born at term; however, preterm infants with weights high fo r gestation al age also have significantly higher mortality rates than infants with comparable weights born at term . When large fo r gestation al occurs with pre-term birth, the mort ality risk is higher than when either condition exists alone (1). Very large infants regardless of their gestational age, have a higher incidence of birth injuries and congenital anomalies (especially congenital heart disease) and developmental and intellectual disability (2). Large for Gestation al Age may be a resu lt of maternal diabetes (which may or may not have been diagnosed before or during pregnancy) and may result in obesity in childhood that may exten d into adu lt life (1).

Cut off values are provided in the attached Tables 2 01A and 201 B, based on the levels established by the Centers for Disease Control a nd Prevention (CDC ). Adjustments for smoking and/or altitude are optional for State agencies as long as the cutoff values used are those indicated on the CDC tables. In addition, Table 201C includes a table of rou nded hematocrit values ad apted from C DC for those WIC agencies that obtain hematocrits only in whole numeric values. Pa rticipant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I Non Breastf eeding Women III, IV, V, or VI Infants I Children III Justification Hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) are the most commonly used tes ts to screen for iron deficiency anemia. Measurements of Hb and Hct reflect the amo unt of functional iron in the body. Changes in Hb concentration and Hct occur at the late stages of iron deficiency. While neither an Hb nor Hct test are direct measures of iron status and do not distinguish among differe nt types of anemia , these tests are useful indicators of iron defici ency anemi a. Iron deficien cy is by far the most common cause of anemia in children a nd women of childbearing age. It may be caused by a diet low in iron, insufficient assimilation of iron from the diet, increased iron requirements due to growth or pregnancy, or blood loss. Anemia can impair energy metabolism, temperature regulation, immune function , and work performance. Anemia during pregn ancy may increase the risk of prematurity, poor maternal weight gain, low birth weight, and infant mortality. In infants a nd children, even mild anemia m ay delay mental and motor developmen t. The risk increas es with the duration and severity of anemia, and ea rly damages are unlikely to be reversed through later t herapy. R eferences 1 . Centers for Disease Control a nd Preventio n.

Cl arification B asis for blood work assessment: For pregna nt women being assessed for iron defici ency anemi a, blood work must be evaluated using trimester values established by CDC. Thus, the blood test result for a pregnant woman would be assessed based on the trimester in which her blood work was taken. D efiniti on of Trimes ter: CDC defines a trimester as a term of three months in t he prena tal gestation period with the specific trimesters defined as follows in weeks: First Trimester: 0 13 weeks Seco nd Trimester: 142 6 weeks Third Trimester: 27 40 weeks Fu rther, C DC begins t he calculation of week s starting with the first day of the last menstrual period. If that date is not available, CDC estimates that date from the estimated date of confineme nt (EDC). This definition is used in interpreti ng CDC's Prenatal Nutrition Surveillance System data, comprised primarily of data on pregnant women participating in t he WIC Program. Adjustments for smoking : A State agency may elect to use only one cutoff for all smokers rather than making s pecific adjustments based on the individual a pplicant's smoking frequenc y. If the State ch ooses to use only one category for this issue, the \"up to <1 pack/day\" cutoff values category as shown on Tabl es 201 A and 201 B is the only one that may be used. 201 Biochemical: Low HematocritLow Hemo globin 2 of 8 Bioch emical: Low Hemato critLow Hemoglob in 201 1st Trimester 2nd Trimester 3rd Trimester Nonpreg 12 < 15 yrs Nonpreg 15 < 18 yrs Nonpreg 18 yrs Infants 0 < 6 mo Infants 6 < 12 mo Child 1 < 2 yrs Child 2 < 5 yrs Altitude Smok ing Hct < Hct < Hct 37.7 > 2 packs/day 38.4 38.2 4000 4999 34.0 36.7 37.9 37.7 1 2 packs/day 38.4 > 1 pack/day 35.5 38.4 38.2 1 2 2 packs/day 37.0 36.0 37.0 39.7 39.9 39.7 Bioch emical: Low Hemato critLow Hemoglob in 4 of 8 201 05/2015 st 1 Trimester nd 2 Trimester rd 3 Trimester Nonpreg 12 < 15 yrs Nonpreg 15 < 18 yrs Nonpreg 18 yrs Infants 0 < 6 mo Infants 6 < 12 mo Child 1 < 2 yrs Child 2 < 5 yrs Altitude Smok ing Hct < Hct < Hct 1 pack/day 38.0 37.0 38.0 40.7 40.9 40.7 1 2 packs/day 41.4 41.7 1 2 2 packs/day 40.0 39.0 42.7 42.7 1 2 40.0 41.0 43.7 Table 201 -

(1)* *The c ut-off value is the current reference value published in guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Participant Category and P riority Level Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I Non -Breast feeding Women III, IV, V, or VI Infants I Children III Justification Lead poisoning is a persistent, but entirely preventable , public health probl em in the United States. Elevated blood lead levels (BLLs) - levels at or above the reference value identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC) - are a potent , pervasive neurotoxicant associated with harmful effects on health, nutritional status, learning and behavior. The CDC recognizes that there is no safe blood lead level for a mother or fetus yet there are no published guidelines for these groups. T herefore, CDC recommends that the same guidelines identified for children be used for prenatal and breastfeeding women as well as infants until specific guidelines are available. (1, 2) Blood lead levels have been declining in the U.S. population as a who le. It is most common in children, but can occur in other groups as well. Children remain at heightened risk because they absorb lead more readily than adults and their developing nervous system is particularly vulnerable to the effects of lead. Elevated blood lead levels in children have been associated with decreased IQ, academic failure, and behavioral problems (1). Avoidance of lead exposure remains the primary preventive strategy for reducing adverse health effects. (1). As a result of the wide variability in lead exposure in different communities , CDC recommends that state and/or local communities implement lead screening requirements based on their local data. If a state or local plan does not exist, it is recommended that the universal B LL testing according to 1991 CDC guidance be followed . (1) Testing Venous blood samples are the preferred method of blood lead testing . Elevated BLLs obtained using capillary (finger stick) samples should be confirmed using a venous blood test. (1) 05/2015 211 2 of 4 Biochemical: Elevated Blood Lead Levels Lead in P regnant Women Lead poisoning in a pregnant woman results in lead cross ing the placenta and can have a detrimental impact on a developing fetus. One cause of lead poisoning in pregnant wom en is from practicing pica. Pica is defined as the eating of one or more nonnutritive substances on a persistent basis for a period of at least one month. Items commonly ingested include soil, clay, ice, starch, baking powder, chalk and paint. C ases of lead poisoning have been found when lead containing items , such as lead -contaminated soil and pottery , have been ingested. Pica is commonly practiced in areas of Africa, Asia, and Central America. I n the United States it occurs more frequently in the South and in immigrant populations where it is culturally acce ptable. In area s of the U.S. where pica is viewed negatively , women may not admit to engaging in these practices thus, it places the pregnant woman and her fetus at risk. (2, 3) Lead in B reastfeeding Women Lead can be passed to the infant through breast milk. S ome mothers exposed to lead may be encouraged to continue breastfeeding if their BLLs are within an acceptable range. The benefits of breastfeeding outweigh the potential health consequences the infant would otherwise endure. Key Recommendations for Initiation of Breastfeeding (2): Mothers with BLLs BLLs >40 \u00b5g/dL should begin breastfeeding when their blood lead levels drop below 40 \u00b5g/dL. Until then , they should pump and discard their breast milk. Key Recommendations for Continuation of Breastfeeding ( 2): Breastfeeding should continue for all infants with BLLs below 5 \u00b5g/dL. Infants born to mothers with BLL > 5 \u00b5g/dL and <40 \u00b5g/dL can continue to breastfeed unless ther e are indications that the breast milk is contributing to elevating BLLs. Lead in I nfants and C hildren Similarly, children with pica may also have an elevated BLL. (For more information about pica p lease see the Lead in Pregnant Women, above and Risk #425 In appropriate Nutrition Practices for Children. ) Lead poisoning is most common in children , especially those living in low income, migrant, or new refugee households. CDC recommends blood lead screening for all children at high r isk for elevated BLLs with follow -up screening within 12 months . Nutrition and Lead A bsorption Adequate consumption of calcium , iron, selenium, and zinc along with vitamins C, D and E decreases the absorption of lead in adults and lowers the susceptibility to the toxic effects in children (2). N utritional status affects the absorption, deposition, and excretion of lead and thus may affect lead toxic ity. Infants and children with a BLL 5 g/dL should be assessed for the adequacy of their diet with a focus on increasing iron, calcium, and vitamin C , as follows: Iron deficiency anemia (IDA ) can be an indicator of lead poisoning as they often coexist . Iron statu s s hould be evaluated and nutritional supplementation may be recommended by the participant 's he alth care provider to correct and prevent IDA . Testing for IDA should occur (4): o Once between ages 9-12 months , o Again 6 months later, a nd o An nually from ages 2 to 5 years . 05/2015 3 o f 4 211 Biochemical: Elevated Blood Lead Levels Inadequate dietary c alcium intake generally affects lead absorption . Results from s ome s tudies indicate that dietary calcium (when consumed at Adequate Intake levels) competitively inhibits lead absorption . The antioxidant , vitamin C , has been shown to have natural chelating properties , enhancing the urinary elimination of lead from the body. (2,4) Referrals WIC agencies must assess the history of lead testing for every infant and child. The WIC staff should make a referral to a chil dren 's health care provider if the: Child has never received a lead test Child had an elevated BLL 12 months prior and has had no interim follow- up screening Child is s uspected by a parent or a health care provider to be at risk for lead exposure Child has a sibling or frequent playmate with an elevated BLL Participant is a recent immigrant, refugee, or foreign adoptee Breastfeeding or lactating woman, parent , or child's principal caregiver works professionally or recreationally with lead Family has a h ousehold member who uses traditional, folk, or ethnic remedies ;cosmetics ; or wh o r outinely eats unregulated/uninspected food imported from abroad Family has been identified at increased risk for lea d exposure by the health department because the family has local risk factors for lead exposure Implications for WIC Nutrition Services WIC nutrition services may benefit participants with lead exposure or elevated B LL in the following ways by: Reinforc ing primary prevention strategies to avoid lead exposure and reduce adverse he alth effects such as offering to explain risk factors and common sources of lead, and providing a referral to lead treatment programs in health departments . Other CDC prevention tips can be found at: http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/tips.htm .

P. 59 -76 06/ 2018 1 301 Gravidarum Definition/Cut- off Value Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG) is defined as severe and persistent nausea and vomiting during pregnancy which may cause more than 5% weight loss and fluid and electrolyte imbalance s (1). This nutrition risk is based on a chronic condition, not single episodes. HG is a clinical diagnosis, made after other causes of nausea and vomiting have been excluded. Presence of condition diagnosed, documented, or reported by a physician or someone working under a physician's orders, or as self -reported by applicant/participant/caregiver. See Clarification for more information about self-reporting a diagnosis. Participant Category and Priority L evel Category Priority Pregnant Women I Justification Nausea and vomiting are common early in gestation; 50-80% or more of pregnant women experience some vomiting. However, pregnant women diagnosed with HG are at risk of weight loss, dehydration, ketonuria, and electrolyte imbalances such as hypokalemia . HG affects approximately 0.3 -3.0% of pregnancies and may lead to adverse fetal consequences and hospitalization in some cases. HG is the second most common reason for hospitalization for pregnant women, with preterm labor being the most common (2). Risk Factors for HG Biological, physiological, psychological and sociocultural factors are thought to be in fluential in HG (3). The various risk fact ors for HG include maternal under weight, multiple pregnancy, nulliparity, previous history of HG and trophoblastic disorders (see clarification). A history of eating disorders , such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia , is also a risk factor associated with HG (4, 5). Helicobacter pylori infection may be a contributing factor for HG (6). Studies indicate that offspring or sibling s of women with HG , and/ or women pregnant with a female fetus , have increased chances of having HG. A history of motion sickness and/or migraine headaches are also risk factors for HG (7). Various hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, adrenocorticotropic hormone , human chorionic gonadotropin (Hc G) play an influential role in HG. Increased level s of HcG , which may occur in molar (s ee clarification) or mul ti fetal pregnancies may be associated with HG. Studies indicate that HG increases when H cG lev el reaches its peak at 9 weeks of gestation (8). It should be noted that thyroid fun ction is affected in pregnancy. For pregnant women with hyperthyroidism , decreased levels of thyroid stimulating hormone may be implicated for HG (9, 10). HG and Adverse Maternal O utcomes HG can adversely affect maternal outcomes and, if inad equately managed, can lead to malnutrition, dehydration, electrolyte i mbalances, thrombosis, and Wernicke's encephalopathy ( a very rare but potentially life -threatening complication of HG, caused by thiamine d eficiency) (11). Vitamin K deficiency has also been reported with HG and may be im plicated in neonatal hemorrhage (12). Other serious 06/2018 301 2 of 5 Clinical/Health/Medical: Hyperemesis Gravidarum complication s include esophageal rupture (caused by severe vomiting), peripheral neuropathy, coagulopathy and Mallory -Weiss syndrome (acute increase in esoph ageal pres sure due to vomiting) (8). Studies indicate that pregnant women with HG in the second trimester are also at an increased risk for placental disorde rs, such as placental abruption (13). Pregnant women with HG are at an increased risk for any autoimmune disorder, and in extreme cases this may lead to organ damage manifesting as oliguria an d abnormal liver function tests (14). In addition, pregnant women with HG are at increased risk for psychological distress therefore leading to an increased risk for de pression and anxiety (15). Other concerns associated with HG include severe distress, social dysfunction and loss of time from work (16, 17). Malnourishment may develop over a period of time in women suffering with HG, which may lead to refeeding syndro me (RFS). RFS includes severe metabolic abnormalities and electrolyte disturbance s due to the change from catabolic to anabolic metabolism that occurs when refeeding (orally , parentally, or enterally) occurs too quickly after severe malnourishment. RFS requires multidisciplinary nutrition team management as it is a life -threaten ing condition (18). HG and Adverse Birth Outcomes Systematic review and meta -analysis indicate that HG is frequently associated with adverse birth outcomes (19). Women with HG have an increased risk of giving birth to low birth weight, small for gestational age, and premature infants (20). Infants born to mothers suffering from HG have increased risk of colic, irritability, and growth restriction s (21). There is a scarcity of data examining the long -term effect on fetus es exposed to HG in utero. However, some studies indicate that there is an increased risk of psychological disorders and reduced insulin sensitivity for infants born to women with HG (22, 23) Implications for WIC Nutrition Services WIC nutrition staff can provide the following nutrition services to w omen with HG : R efer to a health care provider for appropriate monitoring and treatments as necessary . Provide education on how to recognize symptoms of dehydration such as: Increased thirst, dr y m outh, low urine output or urine that is darker in color than normal. Offer suggestions to help with nausea such as: o Avoid foods and smells that seem to trigger nausea (e.g., fried or greasy foods, s picy foods, foods of a certain texture) . o Ea t crackers or dry cereal before getting out of bed to curb nausea in the morning. o Avoid large fluid intakes in the morning. Drink liquids between meals instead of with meals. o Choose foods carefully. Select food s that are high in carbohydrates or protein, low i n fat, and easy to digest. Salty foods are sometimes helpful, as are foods that contain ginger \u2014 such as ginger lollipops. Avoid greasy, spicy and fatty foods. Consume foods that settle the stomach and calm the nausea. (24) o Eat several small meals throughout the day instead of three large meals . Meals s hould contain more carbohydrate than fat and acid. Protein -rich meals also decrease symptoms. Lighter snacks, including nuts, dairy products, and beans, are recommended . (25) 06/ 2018 3 of 5 301 Clinical/Health/Medical: Hyperemesis Gravidarum o Take prenatal supplement at night or before bedtime. Review weight gain goal and weight gain pattern. If weight loss is a problem, discuss nutrient and calorie -dense food choices and refer to the health care provider. Encourage women to take prenatal vitamins if considering becoming pregnant again . Studies indicate that taking prenatal vitamins a month before conception may help alleviate the symptoms of HG during pregnancy (26). Clarification Self-reporting of a diagnosis by a health care provider should not be confused with self -diagnosis, where a person simply claims to have or to have had a medical condition without any reference to professional diagnosis. A self -reported medical diagnosis (\"My doctor says that I have/my son or daughter has...\") should prompt the CPA to validate the presence of the condition by asking more pointed questions related to that diagnosis. Gestational Trophoblastic Disease (GTD) may be defined as a condition in which a tumor develops in the uterus that would normally develop as a placenta. Molar pregnancy or a hydatidiform mole may be classified as a form of noninvasive tumor under GTD . A molar pregnancy results from an abnormal fertilization of the egg lacking in maternal tissues. It should be noted that although the tumor is considered benign they have potential to become malignant. The symptoms include vaginal bleeding, hyperemesis, preeclampsia, and hyperthyroidism .

Garner EI, Clinical/Health/Medical: Gestational Diabetes302 Gestational Diabetes Definition/Cut off Value Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as any degree of glucose/carbohydrate intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy (1, 2). Presence of condition diagnosed, documented, or reported by a physician or someone working under a physician's orders, or as self reported by applicant/participant/caregiver. See Clarification for more information about selfreporting a diagnosis. Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Pregnant Women I Justification The definition of GDM applies regardless of whether insulin or only diet modification is used for treatment, or whether the condition persists after pregnancy. Included in this classification are women who may have had undiagnosed diabetes prior to pregnancy but who are first diagnosed during pregnancy (1, 2). Pregnant women requiring the use of exo genous steroids, tocolytics, or other medications, or who have medical conditions that alter glucose tolerance, may develop GDM (2). GDM represents nearly 90% of all pregnancies complicated by diabetes (1). The criteria for the diagnosis of GDM (3) are shown in Table 1 (see Clarification). Pregnancy is an insulinresistant and diabe t ogenic state (2). Deterioration of glucose tolerance occurs normally during pregnancy, particularly in the 3rd trimester (1, 2). Untreated or poorly treated GDM results in a higher risk of morbidity and mortality for both the mother and the fetus (2). Established risk factors for GDM are advanced maternal age, obesity, and family history of diabetes (4). Risk assessment for GDM should be undertaken at the first prenatal visit. Wome n with clinical characteristics consistent with a high risk for GDM (e.g., those with marked obesity, personal history of GDM or delivery of a previous largeforgestation age infant, glycosuria, polycystic ovary syndrome, or a strong family history of diabetes) should undergo glucose testing as soon as possible (5). Un questionably, there are also ethnic differences in the prevalence of GDM. In the U.S., Native Americans, Asians, Hispanics, and African American women are at a higher risk for GDM than nonHispanic White women. Besides obesity, there is a suggestion that physical inactivity, diets high in saturated fat and smoking are associated with increasing risk for GDM or recurrent GDM (4 ). Infants of women with GDM are at an increased risk of developing obesity, impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes as children or young adults (4). GDM is associated with a higher incidence of maternal and fetal complications. Maternal complications include polycythemia, respiratory distress syndrome, and increased rate of stillbirth (6 ). Although rarely seen in GDM, congenital anomalies, neural tube defects, cardiac abnormalities and/or caudal regression may occur if a woman has GDM in the early first trimester (6, 7). Since GDM is a risk factor for subsequent type 2 diabetes after delivery, life style modifications aimed at reducing weight and increasing physical activity are recommended (8). The National Diabetes Education 07/2009 302 2 of 4 Clinical/Health/Medical: Gestational Diabetes Program (NDEP) is currently promoting a GDM Prevention Initiative, targeting both providers and women with a GDM history (9). Key messages are illustrated in Table 2 (see Clarification). Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) is the primary treatment for the management of GDM (7). MNT for GDM primarily involves a carbohydratecontrolled meal plan that promotes opt imal nutrition for maternal and fetal health with adequate energy for appropriate gestational weight gain, achievement and maintenance of normoglycemia, and absence of ketosis (7, 8). Breastfeeding should be strongly encouraged as it is associated with maternal weight loss and reduced insulin resistance for both mother and offspring (10). WIC nutrition ser vices can reinforce and support the medical and diet therapies (such as MNT) that participants with GDM receive from their health care providers.

Clarification Selfreporting of a diagnosis by a medical professional should not be confused with selfdiagnosis, where a person simply claims to have or to have had a medical condition without any reference to professional diagnosis. A selfreported medical diagnosis (\"My doctor says that I have/my son or daughter has...\") should prompt the CPA to vali date the presence of the condition by asking more pointed questions related to that diagnosis. 07 /2009 3 of 4 302 Clinical/Health/Medical: Gestational DiabetesWomen at high risk for GDM who have tested negative at the initial screening, and women at average risk for GDM should be tested by a licensed medical provider, between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation. Women of average risk should be tested at 2428 weeks of gestation. Testing should follow one of two a pproaches: 1.Onestep approach: perform a diagnostic 100g OGTT (Oral Glucose Tolerance Test). 2.Twostep approach: A screening test (glucose challenge test) that measures plasma or serum glucose is done 1 hour after a 50g oral glucose load without regard for time of day or time of last meal. If a plasma or serum glucose level meets or exceeds the threshold ( 130 mg/dl [7.2 mmol/L] or 140 mg/dl [7.8 mmol/L], an OGTT is performed (3). A diagnosis of GDM is made with a 100g oral glucose load after an overnight fast. Using a 3 hour test, if two or more plasma or serum glucose levels meet or exceed the threshold, a diagnosis of GDM is made. Alternatively, the diagnosis can be made using a 75g oral glucose load. The glucose threshold values for both tests are listed in Table 1 (10). The 75g glucose load test is not as well validated as the 100 g OGTT. With either the 75g OGTT or the 100g OGTT, it is recommended that the test be performed after an overnight fast of at least 8 hours but no longer than 14 hour s. For 3 days prior to the test the woman should consume an unrestricted diet ( 150 g carbohydrate per day) and maintain unrestricted physical activity. Women need to remain seated and not smoke during the test. (1, 2). Table 1.

Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I NonBreastfeeding Women III, IV, V or VI Justification Women who have had a pregnancy complicated by GDM are 4060% more likely to develop diabetes within 1520 years (1), usually type 2 (2). This risk of subsequent diabetes is greatest in women with GDM who are diagnosed early in the pregnancy, exhibit the highest rates of hyperglycemia during the pregnancy, and are obese. Approximatel y 3050% of the women with a history of GDM will develop GDM in a subsequent pregnancy. Studies have found that the risk factors for subsequent GDM include insulin use in the index pregnancy, obesity, diet composition*, physical inactivity, failure to maintain a healthy BMI and weight gain betw een preg nancies (2, 3). In addition, if a woman's lipid levels are elevated, a history of GDM is also a risk factor for cardiovascular disorders (3). There is evidence to suggest that some women with a history of GDM show relative betacell dysfunction during and after preg nancy (3) . Most women with a history of GDM are insulin resistant. Changes in lifestyle (dietary and physical activity) may improve postpartum insulin sensitivity and could possibly preserve Bcell function to slow the progression to type 2 diabetes (2, 3). During WIC nutrition education and counseling, obese women with a history of GDM sho uld be encouraged to lose weight before a subsequent pregnancy. Breastfeeding has been shown to lower the blood glucose level and to decrease the incidence of type 2 diabetes in women with a history of GDM (2, 3). Exercise also has a beneficial effect on insulin action by enhancing perip h eral tissue glucose uptake (3). Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) is an essential component in the care of women with a history of GDM. Women with a history of GDM but without immediate subsequent postpartum diagnosis of diabetes should be advised to discuss with their medical provider the importance of having a Glucose Tole rance Testing (GTT) at 6 to 12 weeks postpartum (see Clarification, Table 1); to have a prepregnancy consultation before the next pregnancy, and to request early glucose screening in the next pregnancy (4). The National Diabetes Education Program (NDEP) is currently promoting a GDM Diabetes Prevention Initiative, targe ting 07/2009 303 2 of 3 Clinical/Health/Medical: History of Gestational Diabetes both providers and women with a history of GDM (5). Key messages are illustrated in Table 2 (see Clarification). WIC nutrition services can support and reinforce the MNT and physical activity recommendations that participants receive from the health care providers. In addition, WIC nutritionists can play an important role in providing women with counselin g to help ma nage their weight after delivery. Also, children of women with a history of GDM should be encouraged to establish and maintain healthy dietary and lifestyle behaviors to avoid excess weight gain and reduce their risk for type 2 diabetes (1). *Diet Composition Carbohydrate is the main nutrient that affects postprandial glucose elevations. During pregnancy complicated with GDM, carbohydrate intake can be manipulated by controlling the total amount of carbohydrate, the distribution of carbohydrate over several meals and snacks, and the type of carbohydrate. These modifications need not affect the total caloric intake level/prescription (6). Because there is wide interindividual variability in the glycemic index each woman needs to determine, with the guidance of the dietitian, which foods to avoid or use in smaller portions at all meals or during specific times of the day, for the duration of her pregnancy. Practice guidelines have avoided labeling foods as \"good\" or \"bad \" (6 ). Meal plans should be culturally appropriate and individualized to take into account the patient's body habitus, weight gain and physical activity; and should be modified as needed throughout pregnancy to achieve treatment goals (6).

Partici pant Category and Priority L evel Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I Non -Breastfeeding Women III, IV, V or VI Justification Please see risk #345 Hypertension and Prehypertension , for a thorough o verview of preeclampsia, including incidence, risk factors, signs and symptoms, prevention, and treat ment. Preeclampsia is defined as hypertension with onset during pregnancy, usually after 20 weeks gestation, and typically with proteinuria (high levels of protein found in urine) . For some women, proteinuria does not occur; for these women, preeclampsia is diagnosed as hypertension with thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) , impaired liver function, renal insufficiency (poor kidney function ), pulmonary edema (excess fluid in the lungs) , and/or ce rebral or visual disturbances (brain and vision problems) (1). The most common type of hypertensi ve disorder during pregnancy, preeclampsia occurs in 3.4% of pre gnancies in the United States and is associated with one maternal death per 100,000 live births in dev eloped countries ( 1, 2). Worldwide, it leads to the death of over 60,000 women annually (3 ). It is important to note that postpartum preeclampsia can also occur, regardless of whether it was present during pregnancy. It is usually diagnosed within 48 hours of delivery but can occur up to 6 weeks postpartum. Thus, women during this period should monitor for preeclampsia symptoms and contact their healthcare provid er immediately if they occur . (1, 4 ) Women with a history of preeclampsia are at greater risk for future hypertension (HTN) , heart attack, strok e, congestive heart failure, metabolic disease , and postpartum depression ; these risks increase with repeated incidence of preeclamp sia and with preterm delivery (1, 2, 5, 6 ). Because women with a history of preeclampsia are at increased risk for HTN and related conditions , implementing lifestyle changes after delivery to help prevent HTN is crucial. Lifestyle measures to reduce the risk of HTN for women who are not pregnant include the following: Have blood pressure checked at least yearly or as recommended by one's healthcare provider. For those at risk of HTN, regularly monitoring blood pressure is crucial. Blood pressure levels greater than 180/120 mmHg are extremely dangerous and require immediate medical att ention (7 ). 05/2019 304 2 of 4 Clinical/Health/Medical: History of Preeclampsia Consume a diet consistent with the Dietary Guidelines fo r Americans or follow the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan. Details regarding the DASH eating plan can be found on the National Heart, Lung , and Blood Institute's website: www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health - topics/dash -eating -plan . Engage in regular physical activity. Achieve and maintain a healthy weight. Limit alcohol and avoid any use of tobacco, marijuana or illegal substances. (See risk #371 Maternal Smoking and risk #372 Alcohol and Substance Use.) Currently, there is inconclusive scientific evidence on preventative measures for preeclampsia in future pregnancies. However , when dietary calcium is inadequate, research indicates adequate dietary calcium or supplementation (1.5 -2 grams/day) may help preve nt preeclampsia (1, 2, 3, 8 ). Dietary folate and folic acid supplementation during pregnancy has also been associated wi th lower risk of preeclampsia (6, 9 ). Breastfeeding Women who had preeclampsi a face a greater risk of HTN later in life; however, longer breastfeeding duration has been foun d to reduce this risk. (10, 11). Unfortunately , women who had preeclampsia during pregnancy are more likely to not initiate breastfeeding or to stop breastfeeding earlier than women wi th normal blood pressure (10, 12 ). Some potential causes for this include greater incidence of preterm birth, low birth weight, caesarean delivery, exposure to medications not compatible with breastfeeding, and mother/infant separation (12 ). Women with history of preeclampsia should be encouraged to breastfeed, unless contraindicated. If postpartum women require antihypertensive medications, medications should be chosen that are compatible with breastfeeding, if possible. It is thus very important for the mother to discuss her breastfeeding status and goals with her healthcare provider to determine the best infant feeding and medication plan. Implications for WIC Nutrition Services The WIC Program provides support to participants with a history of preeclam psia by offering nutritious food that are important components of a diet to help prevent HTN . WIC nutrition staff also offer nutrition education, counseling , and referrals. In addition, WIC staff can assist participants by: Pregnant Women with History of Preeclampsia : Encouraging prenatal care as soon as possible and to attend all health care appointments. Providing information about the symptoms of preeclampsia (sudden weight gain, swelling of face or hands, upper abdominal pain, difficult y breathing, changes in vision (including seeing spots) , severe headache, nausea, and/or vomiting ) and of the importance of contacting their healthcare provider immediately if they occur. Also, inform them that preeclampsia can occur postpartum. Counseling them on hea lthy weight gain, prenatal vitamin use, and a nutritious diet, including adequate calcium intake. For women with low calcium intake, refer them to their healthcare provider to discuss whether a calcium supplement is appropriate. Please note that a low -sodium diet and/or weight loss is not recommended as treatment for HTN during pregnancy . Encouraging them to discuss individualized physical activity recommendations with their healthcare provider. 05/2019 3 of 4 304 Clinical/Health/Medical: History of Preeclampsia Providing information on avoiding any use of alcohol , tobacc o, marijuana or illegal substances , as well as offering substance use referrals .

Early Term: Delivery of an infant born > 37 0/7 and < 38 6/7 weeks . Category Pregnancy Pregnant Women Any history o f preterm or early term delivery Breastfeeding/Non -Breastfeeding Most recent pregnancy Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I Non -Breastfeeding Women III, IV, V or VI Justification Women with a history of preterm delivery have an increase d risk of spontaneous preterm d elive ry in a subsequent pregnancy compared to women with no history of prior spontaneous preterm delivery (3). Prior spontaneous preterm delivery is highly associated with recurrence in subsequent pregnancies. A history of one previous preterm birth is associated wi th a recurrent risk of 17 -37%; the risk increases with the number of prior preterm births and decreases with the number of term deliveries (4 ). Typically a pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks. Premature or preterm birth, however, is defined as a birth that occurs between 20 and 37 weeks of pregnancy, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) (5 ). In the past, the period from 3 weeks before until 2 weeks after the estimated date of delivery was considered a \"term\" pregnancy, with the expectation that a baby would have similar health outcomes if they were born any time during this interval. In 2013, ACOG released a committee opinion that the label \"term\" should be replaced with the designations early term (37 0/7 weeks and 3 8 6/7 weeks gestation) and full term (39 0/7 weeks and 40 6/7 weeks gestation) to more accurately describe these groups of infants (1). Preterm Delivery Prematurity affects about 12% of all live births in the U.S., and about 50% of these preterm births were preceded by preterm labor (6). In 2011, the annual rate of premature births in the United States reached 05/2017 311 2 of 5 Clinical/Health/Medical: History of Preterm or Early Term Delivery 11.7%, nearly two times the rate in European nations (6). Preterm births also account for approximately 70% of newborn deaths and 36% of infant deaths (5 ). Despite advances in neonatal care, preterm birth remains a leading cause of infant death in the United States ( 7). More infants die from pre- term related problems than any other single cause (6). Preterm birth strains society's healthcare resources due to its long -term effects on the health of the newborn ( 6). Premature infants may have physical problems that have nutritional implications, including immature sucking, swallowing and immature digestion and absorption of carbohydrates and lipids (7 ). Preterm infants are at risk for a number of illnesses/health conditions that range from minor to severe complications depending on the circumstances. (See risk 142 Preterm or Early Term Delivery for more details.) Several factors have been found to increase the risk of preterm delivery. Epidemiologic studies have consistently reported low socioeconomic status, nonwhite race, maternal age of 18 years or 40 years, and low pre -pregnancy underweight as risk factors (4). Studies suggest even mo dest restrictions in maternal nutrition around the time of conception can lead to premature births and long -term adverse health effects for offspring ( 8). Other f actors associated with a risk of preterm birth may be identified before pregnancy, at conception, or during pregnancy include (8, 9): L ow materna l weight gain during pregnancy Maternal infections Maternal hypertension G estational diabetes Smoking I ndoor pollution Maternal stress Poor housing quality Teen pregnancy S exually transmitt ed diseases Low psychosocial health status P revious or p resent pregnancy complications Multiple fetuses L ack of p erceived social support A recent study indicated that maternal obesity is also an independent ris k factor for preterm delivery (10 ). Complicat ions associated with obesity (BMI > 30) prior to conception that increase the risk for preterm deliver y include (11): Gestational Diabetes Mellitus Hypertension Preeclampsia Cesarean Delivery 05/2017 3 o f 5 311 Clinical/Health/Medical: History of Preterm or Early Term Delivery Postpartum weight retention Additional concerns related to obesity include potential intrapartum, operative, and postoperative complications and difficulties related to anesthesia management. Obese women are also less likely to initiate and sustain breastfeeding ( 11). Breastfeeding is recommended as th e normative standard for infant feeding and nutrition for all infants, especially preterm babies. Breastfeeding preterm infants has been associated with positive health outcomes for these infants, including: Improved motor ma turity and cognitive ability (12 , 13, 14 ) Re duced risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (15, 16) Reduced risk of retinopathy of prematurity and retinal detachment ( 17) Additionally, mothers of preterm infants produce milk that is designed to meet the baby's particular needs during the first few weeks of breastfeeding. It is higher in protein and minerals, such as salt, and contains different types of fat that the baby will be able to digest and absorb more easily compared to the milk of mothers of full term babies. The fat in human milk also helps to enhance the development of the baby's brain and neurologic tissues, which is especially important for premature infants. Human milk is also easier for babies to digest than formula and avoids exposing the baby's immature intestinal lining t o the cow's milk proteins found in premature infant formula. Preterm infants who are breastfed are less likely to develop intesti nal infections than babies who are formula fed, and the colostrum produced in the first few days contains high concentrations of antibodies that will also h elp the baby fight infection. (16 ) Breastfeeding preterm infants, especially if they are in the NICU, may present unique challenges for breastfeeding dyads. These mothers will benefit from extra breastfeeding support due to t he delay of direct breastfeeding, reliance on breast pumps, and the stress of having a sick newborn. Even if the baby cannot breastfeed directly from the breast at first, the mother can be encouraged to express her milk to ensure that her supply is maintained. Supportive care for infants in the NICU may include the use of a feeding tube. Expressed human milk can be passed through the tube, so it is important for the mother to discuss her feeding decisions with her baby's doctor. Early Term Up to 10% of babies in the United States are scheduled for early term deliveries via labor -inducing medication or cesarean section before 39 weeks of gestation despite neither the mother nor the baby being at risk if the pregnancy continues ( 18). Elective deliveries like this are sometimes requested for reasons such as wanting to schedule the date of the infant's birth, physician preference, or for relief of symptom s at the end of the pregnancy ( 18). Research shows that a fetus will experience a significant amount of development and growth of the lungs, brain, and liver between 37 and 39 weeks of gestation. The brain develops at its fastest rate at the end of the pregnancy, at a rate of up to one thir d between weeks 35 and 39. Additionally, layers of fat are added under the infant's skin during the last few weeks of pregnancy which helps them keep warm after birth. According to ACOG, non -medically warranted deliveries prior to 39 weeks should be avoi ded ( 19). Early term delivery puts an additional strain on society as the early term infant will likely require a longer hospital stay and may have long term health care needs ( 18). Factors that can increase the risk of a woman delivering an early term in fant are the same and are stated above for preterm birth . 05/2017 311 4 of 5 Clinical/Health/Medical: History of Preterm or Early Term Delivery When a woman delivers an early term infant or chooses an early elective delivery, she is at increased risk for postpartum depression, cesarean delivery, and other complications requiring longer ho spital stays (18 ). Steps pregnant women can take in order to decrease the prevalence of pre -term births include (18): Seek regular prenatal care throughout pregnancy. Maintain a healthy diet, including daily prenatal vitamins . Cease consumption of alcohol , drugs, or other dangerous toxins during pregnancy. Avoid stress . Contact their health care provider with all questions or concerns . Implications for WIC Nutrition Service s Pregnant women who come from low or inadequate income households are at a greater risk for poor physical and mental health due to poor eating habits. WIC services may assist women at risk of preterm and early term births by providing them with proper nutr ition. Early prevention is the primary way to stop preterm labors. WIC can assist in reducing preterm deliveries by increasing prevention strategies. WIC can improve outcomes through: Recommending healthy maternal weight gain and providing nutrition education that addresses the WIC food package and other healthy foods that contribute to a balanced diet . Promoting early and regular prenatal care . Encouraging use of prenatal vitamins, as prescribed by the health care provider . Recommending adherence to Dietary Guidelines for Americans .

( 2500 grams) for the following: Category Pregnancy Pregnant Women Any history of low birth weight Breastfeeding/Non -Breastfeeding Most recent pregnancy Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I Non -Breastfeeding Women III, IV, V or VI Justification A woman's history of a delivery of a low birth weight (LBW) baby is the most reliable predictor for LBW in her subsequent pregnancy (1). The risk for LBW is 2-5 times higher than average among women who have had previous LBW deliveries and increases with the number of previous LBW deliveries (1). This is true for histories in which the LBW was due to premature birth, fetal growth restriction (FGR) or a combination of these factors. The extent to which nutritional interventions (dietary supplementation and counsel) can decrease risk for repeat LBW depends upon the relative degree to which poor nutrition was implicated in each woman's previous poor pregnancy outcome. Nutritional deficiencies and excesses have been shown to result in LBW and pregnancy loss. The pregnant woman's weight gain is one of the most important correlates of birth weight and of FGR (2, 3).

Participant Category and Priority L evel Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I Non -Breastfeeding Women III, IV, V or VI 04/2001 321 2 of 3 Clinical/Health/Medical: H istory of Spontaneous Abortion, Fetal or Neonatal Loss Justification Pregnancy Previous fetal and neonatal deaths are strongly associated with preterm low birth weight (LBW) and small for gestational age (SGA) and the risk increases as the number of previous poor fetal outcomes goes up. Spinnillo et al found that the risk for future small for gestational age outcomes increased two fold if a woman had 2 or more SAB. Adverse outcomes related to history of SAB include recurrent SAB, low birth weight (including preterm and small for gestational age infants), premature rupture of membranes, neural tube defects and major congenital malformations. Nutrients implicated in human and animal studies include energy, protein, folate, zinc, and vitamin A. Postpartum women A SAB has been implicated as an indicator of a possible neural tube defect in a subsequent pregnancy. Women who have just had a SAB or a fetal or neonatal death should be counseled to increase their folic acid intake and delay a subsequent pregnancy until nutrient stores can be replenished. The extent to which nutritional interventions (dietary supplementation and counseling) can decrease the risk for repeat poor pregnancy outcomes depends upon the relative degree to which poor nutrition was implicated in each woman's previous poor pregnancy outcome. WIC Program clients receive foods and services that are relevant and related to ameliorating adverse pregnancy outcomes. Specifically, WIC food packages include good sources of implicated nutrients. Research confirms that dietary intake of nutrients provided by WIC foods improve indicators of nutrient status and/or fetal survival in humans and/or animals. References 1.

Note: A woman who becomes pregnant within 16 months after a SAB (her first) would qualify for risk #332, Closely Spaced Pregnancies. 12/2020 1 of 7 331 Clinical/Health/ Medical : Pregnancy at a Young Age 331 Pregnancy at a Young Age Definition/Cut -off Value Pregnancy at a young age is defined as conception at 20 years of age for the following (1): Category Pregnancy Pregnant Women Current pregnancy Breastfeeding/Non -Breastfeeding Most recent pregnancy Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I Non -Breastfeeding Women III, IV, V or VI Justification Pregnancy in women under the age of 20 is associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes such as anemia, eclampsia, postpartum depression, maternal death , low birth weight, preterm delivery and stillbirth (1, 2). Pregnancy before the age of 20 years , which may also be referred to as adolescent /teen pregnancy , can have long -term impacts and is associated with lower socioeconomic and education status and increased health care costs (3). As the adolescent mother has not yet completed her own growth, there may be suboptimal nutrient levels available to support both her growth and that of the fetus (4). Studies indicate that there is competition for nutrients between the still growing adolescent mother and her rapidly developing fetus which is also known as 'nutr ient partitioning'. This may result in compromised growth and development of the mother and/or fetus (5). The mother and infant are at greater risk of the adverse outcomes listed below due to adolescent pregnancy. Increased Risk of Adverse Outcomes to Mother and Infant due to Adolescent Pregnancy (6, 7, 8 ) Mother at Increased Risk of: Infant at Increased Risk of: Repeat teen pregnancy Sexually transmitted disease Anemia Cesarean delivery Lack of early prenatal care Very low birth weight & low birth weight Congenital malformations Sudden Unexplained Infant Death (SUID) Low Apgar Score 12/2020 331 2 of 7 Clinical/Health/Medical: Pregnancy at a Young Age Mother at Increased Risk of: Infant at Increased Risk of: Preeclampsia Substance misuse Not completing high school Socioeconomic disadvantage Depress ion (in comparison with adults) Prematurity Developmental delays Behavior disorders Nutrition al Impact Adolescence is a period of r apid growth and development and, thus, increased nutritional needs. Pregnancy further increases energy and nutrient demands in adolescen ts. Some studies indicate that adolescent s enter pregnanc y with poor nutritional status due to unhealthy eating behaviors such as skipping meal s, inappropriate weight control practices, and fr equent consumption of fast food (9). Nutritional surveys across the lifespan indicate that the highest prevalence of nutritional deficiencies occurs during adolescence . A systematic review reported that the nutrient intakes of pregnant adolescents appeared to be low in several nutrients (as discussed below ) which are vital for fetal growth a nd development during pre gnancy (10). Iron Iron is a component of hemoglobin important in the transfer of oxygen from the lungs to organs . Iron deficiency anemia is one of the mos t common nutrient deficiencies during pregnancy, and its impact is amplified for pregnant adolescents . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2003 -2010 N ational Health and Nutritional Examination Survey data, among non -pregnant females 12 to 19 years of age, 9 -11% had iron deficiency, and 2 -3% had iron deficiency anemia (11). Compared to pregnant adult women, pregnant adolescents have higher iron requirements as adolescents experience rapid expansion of blood volume due to normal adolescent growth. The CDC recommends supplements of 15 -30 mg per day of iron f or most women durin g pregnancy. However, pregnant adolescents who are diagnosed with iron deficiency are often prescribed doses of iron as high as 60 -120 mg/day (12). The risk of iron deficiency increases further with each additional pregnancy due to the demand of normal g rowth, pregnancy, and the inability to replace blood loss experienced in childbirth (13). For more information about iron needs during pregnancy please see risk #201 Low Hematocrit or Hemoglobin . Calcium Calcium is required during pregnancy for the develo pment of the fetal skeleton. In a pregnant adolescent, the maternal diet needs to contain enough calcium to mineralize two skeletons, as an adolescent is still in the process of attaining peak bone mass and continued skeletal growth . Low calcium intake in adolescents is associated with low bone density and increased later risk of osteoporosis for the mother (14). The Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for calcium for adolescents is 1300 mg per day ; however , studies indicate that the average calcium intakes among 12- 19 year -old females in t he U.S. is about 800 mg per day (15). This may be due to the consumption of low -calcium beverages , such as soft drinks and fruit drinks that are frequently chosen instead of milk (16). Although the RDA for calcium does not increase during pregnancy, if an adolescent has inadequate calcium intake during pregnancy it can lead to negative consequences for both the mother and infant, including increased risk of maternal hypertension and preeclampsia (14). 12/2020 3 of 7 331 Clinical/Health/ Medical : Pregnancy at a Young Age Folate During pregnancy, folic acid is needed for cell division; during lactation it is required for the synthesis and secretion of milk. If the dietary supply of folate is low, circulating levels begin to decline during the fifth month of pregnancy and continue to dec line unt il several weeks after delivery (17). Folate deficiency during pregnancy may result in intrauterine growth restriction, congenital anomalies, or spontaneous abortion. Although prenatal vitamins contain folic acid, vitamin adherence has been repor ted to be low among adolescents (18). Smoking and alcohol use can negatively influence the folate levels in pregnant adolescents, as they both lower red b lood cell folate concentrations (17). Vitamin B12 Vitamin B12 is essential for normal neurological function and red blood cell formation during pregnancy. Low levels of vitamin B12 , especially in pregnant adolescents , may lead to spontaneous abortion, pregnancy loss, intrauterine growth restriction, low birthweight (<2500 g), and neural tube defects . Folate supplementation may mask the adverse effects of low vitamin B12. Therefore, along with adequate supplementation of folate , it is also recommended that pregnant adolescents have their vitamin B12 status monitored. Vitamin B12 is mainly found in anim al sources (meat and dairy products), therefore pregnant teen s who follow strict vegetarian /vegan diets or have other diet restrictions are at risk of deficiency . Some studies have indicated that daily maternal supplementation with 50 g of daily oral vitamin B12 during pregnancy and early lactation significantly improved maternal plasma and breast milk measures of vitamin B12 status, as well as multiple measures of infant vitamin B12 status . (19, 20 ) Zinc Zinc is important in the preco nception period for optimal reproductive health and immune function. It also plays a vital role during e mbryo development , fetal growth, and lactation , causing the requirement for zinc to increase during pregnancy and lactation. Pregnant adolescents are vulnerable to developing zinc deficiency , which can affect both fetal and maternal growth (15). Additi onally, low iron intake is linked with inhibit ion of zinc absorption . Therefore , health care providers may advise pregnant adolescents to take both a zinc and iron supplement . Studies indicate that zinc supplementation may have a modest effect on reducing the risk of preterm birth (21). Weight Gain during Teen Pregnancy The National Academies of Science s, Engineering and Medicine guidelines recommend maternal weight gain of between 11 -40 lbs. during pregnancy based on pre -pregnancy body mass index (BMI) (22). There are no specific /separate weight gain recommendations for teen pregnancy . The risk of preterm delivery and low birth weight delivery decreases with ade quate weight gain in pregnancy. Studies indicate that pregnant adolescents who have similar pregnancy weight gains as adult counterparts and deliver low birthweight infants may have experienced weight gains attributed to normal adolescent growth and development rather than app ropriate pregnancy weight gains (23). Breastfeeding Promotion and Support In a review of studies examining breastfeeding among adolescent mothers, the findings sho wed that most adolescent mothers inte nded to breastfeed. Yet, breastfeeding initiation ranged from 39% to 69%. Almost half of adolescent mothers stopped within 1 month. During the prenatal period, the promotion of positive maternal perceptions about breastfeeding was found to be important to suppo rt the intention to breastfeed. In the early postpartum period, positive support from partners and health -care professionals was essential to sustaining positive maternal attitudes toward the initiation and continuation of 12/2020 331 4 of 7 Clinical/Health/Medical: Pregnancy at a Young Age breastfeeding. In addit ion, the perceived benefits of breastmilk motivated the mother to continue feeding for a longer duration because of the value of her infant's health. (24) Psychos ocial Impact Pregnancy may lead to increased psychological stress for the adolescent, especial ly in the case of unplanned pregnancies , and thus may increase the risk of postpartum depression and long term depression (25). Research indicates that the combination of poverty and existing distress i s a predictor of teen pregnancy (26). The related psychological and emotional stress may be related to factors that include the additional perinatal and economic responsibilities, adjustment in lifestyle , and changes in the family dynamic. The impact of any stress may continue into adulthood or be lifelo ng. Studies suggest that adolescents who stay in school to age 18 are less likely to give birth than those who leave school with less than 12 years of education (26, 27) . A 2016 Cochrane review suggests that primary prevention interventions (e.g., school, community , home , clinic or faith -based ) have been shown to lower the rate of unintended pregnancies among adolescents (27). Interventions that may help adolescent mothers stay in school are more likely to complete high school during pregnancy and postpartum. Strong school connections , family assistance, or commitment in comp leting educational goals may also reduce multiparity in adolescents (26, 28). Implications for WIC Nutrition Services WIC staff can provide the followi ng nutrition services to women under 20 years of age: Educate on how the WIC food package helps to provide important nutrients needed during pregnancy and how to incorporate WIC foods into their total diet to get a balanced diet . Promote the mom -focused W IC Breastfeeding Support website to learn more about breastfeeding Offer individualized referrals based on assessed needs and interests, including referrals to prenatal care, home visiting programs, WIC Peer Counselors, parenting and childbirth programs, a nd other health and social services . Monitor weight gain as needed and educate about appropriate maternal weight gain based on BMI. Encourage: o Adequate prenatal care. o Consumption of prenatal vitamins, as recommended by the ir health care provider. o Consumption of adeq uate amounts of iron, zinc and calcium -rich foods in order to meet the recommended intake. Advise that the pregnant adolescents speak with their healthcare providers to ensure that their folate and vitamin B12 levels are within recommen ded range . Discuss infant feeding plans and provide information to support breastfeeding goals, as appropriate. Refer ences 1. Maiden K, Gunter WD, Martin SS, et al.

Reduced school dropout rates among adolescent mothers receiving school -based prenatal care. Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med. 2004 Mar [cited Interpregnancy Interval Definition/Cut-off Value Short Interpregnancy Interval (IPI), formerly known as Closely Spaced Pregnancies , is defined as an interpregnancy interval of less than 18 months from the date of a live birth to the conception of the subsequent pregnancy for the following: Category Pregnancy Pregnant Women Current pregnancy Breastfeeding /Non -Breastfeeding Women Most recent pregnancy Note: The evidence-based information supporting this criterion is specific to live births and did not include women who had miscarriages or stillbirths. Thus, the definition for this criterion is specific only to women who experienced live births. Women whose pregnancies did not result in a live birth may be assigned, as appropriate, Risk #321 History of Spontaneous Abortions, Fetal or Neonatal Loss . Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I Non -Breastfeeding Women III, IV, V, or VI Justification Adverse maternal and infant health outcomes have been associated with short Interpregnancy Intervals (IPIs). While there is no standard definition for short IPI, an IPI less than 18 months has been associated with increased risk for adverse outcomes (1, 2). An interval of 18 to 24 months has been associated with the lowest relative risk (2). Evidence associated with the lowest relative risk for an IPI following a miscarriage or abortion is still unclear (see Clarification Section for more information) therefore only health effects associated with a short IPI following a live birth were reviewed for this criterion. Historically, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international authorities had recommended at least 2-3 years between pregnancies and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) had suggested an interval of 3-5 years. Given the inconsistency, various countries and regional programs requested the WHO to further review the research and provide recommendations. As a result, the report from the 2005 WHO Technical Consultation and Scientific Review of Birth Spacing recommended an interval of at least 24 months after a live birth to reduce the risk of adverse maternal, perinatal, and infant outcomes. (3). A more recent review of data suggests that there are increased risks for adverse perinatal and maternal outcomes with an IPI less than 18 months (1, 2 ,4) and increased risks for perinatal (1, 4) and maternal (4, 5, 6) outcomes longer than 59 months while 18 to 24 months was associated with the lowest relative risk (2). Parallel to recent findings, Healthy People 2020 has proposed a 10% improvement in reducing the proportion of pregnancies conceived within 18 months of a previous birth (7). 05/2015 332 2 of 4 Clinical/Health/Medical: Short Interpregnancy Interval Outcomes associated with short IPI have included maternal complications such as uterine rupture in women attempting a vaginal birth after a previous cesarean delivery (also referred to as VBAC) (8, 9); and perinatal and neonatal complications such as preterm birth (1, 2, 10), low birth weight (1, 2), small for gestational age (1, 2), birth defects (11), and autism (12, 13). Short interpregnancy interval has been identified as a risk for increasing uterine rupture in women attempting a VBAC delivery (8, 9, 14). Yet when comparing short interpregnancy interval to labor type - induced labor and spontaneous, there was a decrease rate in VBAC success in women who were induced, and no difference with spontaneous labor (15). Given the lack of a specific IPI recommendation for women with a previous cesarean delivery and the inconsistencies in study designs there appears to be no specific guidelines for interval length after a cesarean delivery (1 6). The short interpregnancy interval definition cut- off of 18 months, however, appears to be inclusive of women who delivered by cesarean with their previous pregnancy. Factors contributing to adverse outcomes and short IPI remain controversial. It was thought that socioeconomic factors contributed to adverse outcomes. However, when controlled for possible cofounders, short IPI remained an independent risk factor (1, 2). Nutrition-related hypothetical causal mechanisms have been proposed to explain the effects short IPIs have on health, yet research remains inconclusive (4). The Maternal Depletion Syndrome hypothesized that mothers who have a short IPI often do not have adequate time to replenish macro- and micro-nutrients which may lead to the mother and fetus competing for nutrients (17). However, a recent systematic review of the literature found no evidence to support this hypothesis (4). Studies to support the folate depletion theory have had differing results (11, 18). When folate intake is inadequate, concentrations begin to decrease in the fifth month of pregnancy and for several weeks after birth (19). Women who did not take folic acid supplementation during pregnancy, compared to women who did, were at greater risk of fetal growth restriction with a short (less than six months) IPI and, this risk was found to decrease as IPI increased (18). Of interest, a retrospective Canadian study of 46,243 women found an association between IPI (less than six months) and folate-independent anomalies, however not for folate-dependent anomalies such as neural tube defects, cleft lip and palate, and cardiovascular defects (11). In addition, the association between short IPI and anemia was found inconclusive (2). Implications for WIC Nutrition Service Findings from a small pilot study found coordination of primary health care and social support services reduced adverse pregnancy outcomes and the average number of pregnancies conceived within 18 months among l ow-income African-American who previously delivered a very low birth weight baby (20). Results from a 2007 U.S. survey found that among women of childbearing age, those aged 18-24 years were the least aware of the need for folic acid prior to pregnancy and least likely to report daily use of supplements containing folic acid. Of equal concern, only 17% of women aged 18-24 years were likely to hear about folic acid from their healthcare provider. (21) Initiations of healthcare referrals for family planning, early prenatal care, and folic acid supplementation have the potential to improve health outcomes for women, infants, and children. Given that half of all pregnancies nationwide are unintended (22), WIC can help to reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes by: Encouraging postpartum women and their partner to meet with their healthcare provider to discuss developing a reproductive plan and birth spacing, as appropriate. http://www.cdc.gov/preconception/documents/rlphealthproviders.pdf 05/2015 3 of 4 332 Clinical/Health/Medical: folic acid supplementation. http://www.cdc.gov/features/folicacidbenefits/ Encouraging healthful eating patterns consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/DietaryGuidelines References 1.

Clarification Study results for an optimal Interpregnancy Interval (IPI) following a termination or miscarriage have been inconsistent (3, 10, 23, 24). The WHO Technical Consultation on Birth Spacing Report recommended a minimum interval of at least six months between a miscarriage or induced abortion and the next pregnancy. This recommendation was based on a large retrospective cross-sectional study, a review of 258,108 hospital records from several Latin American countries between 1985-2002, that found women whose previous pregnancy resulted in a spontaneous or induced abortion and had an IPI shorter than 6 months had an increased risk for adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes (21). Given several limitations in the study the WHO cautioned against generalizing the results to other regions or even within the Latin American region since service operations and conditions may differ from the study sample (3). However, more recently a review of approximately a million California births found a decreased risk for preterm birth for women with an IPI of less than six months after a terminated pregnancy (10). An overview of the research found that there may be little benefit from delaying pregnancy after an uncomplicated miscarriage, and to that end pregnancy spacing recommendations following a miscarriage should be individually tailored to the person. ( 25) 04/2001 1 of 2 334 Clinical/Health/Medical: Lack of or Inadequate Prenatal Care 334 Lack of or Inadequate Prenatal Care Definition/Cut-off Value Prenatal care beginning after the 1st trimester (after 13th week), or based on an Inadequate Prenatal Care Index published in a peer reviewed article such as the one by Kessner et al. (4). First prenatal visit in the third trimester (7-9 months) or: Weeks Gestation Number of Prenatal Visits (2) 14 - 21 0 or unknown 22 - 29 1 or less 30 - 31 2 or less 32 - 33 3 or less 34 or more 4 or less Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Pregnant Women I Justification Women who do not receive early and adequate prenatal care are more likely to deliver premature, growth retarded, or low birth weight infants (3). The Kessner Index can be used to assess the adequacy of prenatal care for a woman with an uncomplicated pregnancy. Women with medical or obstetric problems, as well as younger adolescents, may need closer management; the frequency of prenatal visits should be determined by the severity of identified problems (1). Several studies have reported significant health and nutrition benefits for pregnant women enrolled in the WIC Program (3). References 1.

If that date is not available, CDC estimates that date from the estimated date of confinement (EDC). This definition is used in interpreting CDC's Prenatal Nutrition Surveillance System data, comprised primarily of data on pregnant women participating in the WIC Program. 07 /2009 1 of 2 335 Clinical/Health/Medical: Multifetal Gestation335 Multifetal Gestation Definition/Cut off Value More than one (> 1) fetus in a current pregnancy (Pregnant Women) or the most recent pregnancy (Breastfeeding and NonBreastfeeding Women). Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I NonBreastfeeding Women III, IV, V or VI Justification Multifetal gestations are associated with low birth weight, fetal growth restriction, placental and cord abnormalities, preeclampsia, anemia, shorter gestation and an increased risk of infant mortality. Twin births account for 16% of all low birth weight infants. The risk of pregnancy complications is greater in women carrying twins and increases markedly as the number of fet uses increases (1, 2). For twin gestations, the 2009 IOM recommendations provide provisional guidelines: normal weight women should gain 3754 pounds; overweight women, 3150 pounds; and obese women, 2542 pounds (3). There was insufficient information for the IOM committee to develop even provisional guidelin es for underweight women with multiple fetuses. A consistent rate of weight gain is advisable. A gain of 1.5 pounds per week during the second and third trimesters has been associated with a reduced risk of preterm and lowbirth weight delivery in twin pregnancy (2). In triplet pregnancies the overall gain should be around 50 pounds with a steady rat e of gain of approximately 1.5 pounds per week throughout the pregnancy (2). Education by the WIC nutritionist should address a steady rate of weight gain that is higher than for singleton pregnancies. Pregnant or breastfeeding women with twins have greater requirements for all nutrien t s than women with only one infant. Postpartum, nonbreastfeeding women delivering twins are at greater nutritional risk than similar women delivering only one infant. All three groups of women would benefit greatly from the nutritional supplementation provided by the WIC Program. References 1.Brown JE and Carlson M. Nutrition and multifetal pregnancy.

FGR is usually defined as a fetal weight 10th percentile for gestational age. Presence of condition diagnosed, documented, or reported by a physician or someone working under a physician's orders, or as self reported by applicant/participant/caregiver. See Clarification for more information about self-reporting a diagnosis. Participant Category and Priority L evel Category Priority Pregnant Women I Justification Fetal Growth Restriction (FGR) usually leads to low birth weight (LBW) which is the strongest possible indicator of perinatal mortality risk. Severely growth restricted infants are at increased risk of fetal and neonatal death, hypoglycemia, polycythemia, cerebral palsy, anemia, bone disease, birth asphyxia, and long term neurocognitive complications. FGR may also lead to increased risk of ischemic heart disease, hypertension, obstructive lung disease, diabetes mellitus, and death from cardiovascular disease in adulthood. FGR may be caused by conditions affecting the fetus such as infections and chromosomal and congenital anomalies. Restricted growth is also associated with maternal height, prepregnancy weight, birth interval, and maternal smoking. WIC's emphasis on preventive strategies to combat smoking, improve nutrition, and increase birth interval, may provide the guidance needed to improve fetal growth. References 1. Altman DG, Hytten FE.

A self- reported medical diagnosis (\"My doctor says that I have/my son or daughter has...\") should prompt the CPA to validate the presence of the condition by asking more pointed questions related to that diagnosis. 04 /2004 1 of 2 337 Clinical/Health/Medical: History of Birth of a Large for Gestational Age Infant 337 History of Birth of a Large for Gestational Age Infant Definition/Cut off Value History of birth of a large for gestational age infant is defined as follows: Category Definition Pregnant Women Any history of giving birth to an infant weighing greater than or equal to 9 lbs.

Macrosomia may be an indicator of maternal diabetes (current or gestational) or a predictor of future diabetes (2). The incidence of maternal, fetal, and neona tal complications is high with neonates weighing greater than 9 lbs. (4000 grams).

Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Pregnant Women I Justification Generally, it is considered safe for most women to continue breastfeeding while pregnant and can be sustained for as long as mutually desir ed by the mother and child (1 ). The assignment of this risk is not intended to discourage women from continuing breastfeeding during pregnancy, but rather to highlight the need to review the mother's medical history and diet along with her breastfeeding goals. Incidence rates of br eastfeeding while pregnant among U.S. mothers ha ve not been reported recently . The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III indicated that between 1988 and 1994 only 5% of North American breastfeeding women were pregnant (2). Research on breastfeeding during pregnancy , especially among U.S. populations, is very limited ; however, some studies have examined the relationship that this practice has on birth outcomes , such as preterm delivery , miscarriage, and birth weight. During b reastfeeding, stimulation of the nipples causes the secretion of the hormone oxytocin, which can result in contractions of the uterus (3). It has been suggested that these contractions may induce labor and therefore increase the risk of delivering prematu rely in some women ; however, this is not a concern for the typical low risk pregnancy (1, 4, 5). In a small retrospective study of 57 U.S. mothers with an unknown previous pregnancy outcome , most did not notice any uterine contractions specific to breastf eeding . The women that did notice uterine contractions specific to breastfeeding gave birth to healthy babies (6). Studies of pregnancy -breastfeeding overlap among women with a history of preterm delivery or miscarriage are presently lacking in the scientific literature. As a result, these women should be encouraged to talk with their health care provider about their breastfeeding goals and report any uterine contractions (1). For more information on premature delivery, see risk #142 Preterm or Early Term Delivery or risk #311 History of Preterm or Early Term Delivery . Several studies of pregnancy -breastfeeding over lap have been conducted with women without a history of preterm labor or miscarriage , and no statistic ally significant increased risk of premature delivery were reported (7, 8). One retrospective study compared the outcomes of pregnancies in mothers with no history of premature delivery or miscarriage that had one full -term infant and continued breastfeeding during pregnancy to a control group of comparable age and pregnan cy history that stopped breastfeeding at least three months before becoming pregnant. Fewer pregnancies ( 7.3% ) in the breastfeeding group resulted in spontaneous abortion than the control group (8.4%) (7). In a systematic review of all of the relevant literature published between 1990 and 2015 , none of the studies reviewed reported significant differences in the numbers of premature births between pregnant mothers who breastfed and non -breastfeeding pregnant mothers, even when breastfeeding duration, the number of feedings, or birth interval were 05/2019 338 2 of 4 Clinical/Health/Medical: Pregnant Women Currently Breastfeeding controlled for (9). These results provide evidence for continued support of breastfeeding during pregnancy for mothers with no previous history o f preterm labor or miscarriage. Several studies have also examined the effect of breastfeeding during pregnan cy on the birth weight of the infant. These studies reported similar m ean birth weights between infants born to mothers who breastfed during pregnancy and those who did not. (5, 8, 10 , 11) When a woman is pregnant or breastfeeding, she has a higher need f or certain vitamins and minerals and may have greater caloric needs as well . The same is true for a woman who is pregnant while breastfeeding . It is important to note that caloric needs must be individualized based on current weight , physical activity, and recommended maternal weight gain for weight status (i.e., underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese). For more information about maternal weight gain , see risk #131 Low Maternal Weight Gain or risk #133 High Maternal Weight Gain . Implications f or WIC Nutrition Services WIC staff can support pregnant women who are breastfeeding by: Considering personal feelings about breastfeeding while pregnant as well as personal breastfeeding goals with the currently breastfed child. Referring mothers who have a history of premature labor or miscarriage and those who are concerned about uterine contractions to their health care providers . Providing nutrition education that supports an overall healthy diet, including: o Limiting calories from added sugars and satu rated fats. o Choosing a variety of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and fat -free or low -fat dairy products. o Eating protein -rich foods such as poultry, fish, beans, eggs, nuts , and lean meats. Pregnant women , including those who are breastfeeding , should avoid eating shark, swordf ish, king mackerel, or tilefish due to concern for high levels of mercury. White (albacore) tuna should be limited to no more than 6 ounces per week (12). o Drinking plenty of fluids. During breastfeeding, fluid needs may increase , and m others may notice that they are thirstier than usual. Women should drink enough water and other fluids to quench their thirst. A common suggestion is to drink a glass of water with every breastfeeding session (13). Monitoring weight statu s throughout the pregnancy to ensure appropriate weight gain . Providing tips for reducing nipple soreness or breast tenderness if women report these concerns. Hormonal changes during pregnancy lead to nipple soreness and breast tenderness in some women (3). Informing women that the older child that is breastfeeding may notice some changes in the human milk and wean on his/her own. Although human milk continues to be nutritionally sound throughout pregnancy, the composition of it may change , which might change the way the milk tastes. For some women, their milk production may also decrease as their pregnancy progresses. These factors c an lead the breastfeeding child to wean on his/ her own before the baby is born. (1) Issuing Food Package VII to the mother until her older infant turns one, as long as she is partially (mostly) breastfeeding. 05/2019 3 of 4 338 Clinical/Health/Medical: Pregnant Women Currently Breastfeeding Provid ing anticipa tory guidance on tandem nursing, which is the practice of breastfeeding two or more children of different ages at the same time. This may ease the older child's adjustment to the new baby, address the mother's own desire to maintain closeness with the older child, and even make child care easier in some cases as both children are fed and comforted on the breast. This may also allow the mother and child ren to fulfill the American Academy of Pediatrics' recommendation to continue breastfeeding for as long as mutually desired by the mother and child (14).

Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I NonBreastfeeding Women III, IV, V or VI Justification The single greatest risk factor for a pregnancy with a neural tube defect is a personal or family history of such a defect. More than 50% of recurrences can be prevented by taking folic acid before conception. Recent studies suggest that intake of folic acid may also be inversely related to the occurrence of cleft lip and palate. The WIC Program provides nutrition education and folic acidrich foods to women to help prevent future birth defects. Recurrent birth defects can also be linked to other inappropriate nutritional intake prior to conception or during pregnancy, such as inadequate zinc (LBW) or excess vitamin A (cleft palate or lip). The food package and nutrition education provided to WIC participants help women at risk make food choices that provide appropriate nutrient levels. References 1.

Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I Non- Breastfeeding Women III, IV, V, or VI Infants I Children III Justification Nutrient deficiencies or diseases can be the result of poor nutritional intake, chronic health conditions, acute heal th conditions, medications, altered nutrient metabolism, or a combination of these factors, and can impact the levels of both macronutrients and micronutrients in the body. They can lead to alterations in energy metabolism, immune function, cognitive function, bone formation, and/or muscle function, as well as growth and development if the deficiency is present during fetal development and early childhood. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that less than 10% of the United States population has nutrient deficiencies; however, nutrient deficiencies vary by age, gender, and/or race and ethnicity (1 ). For certain segments of the population, nutrient deficiencies may be as high as one third of the population (1 ). Intake patterns of individuals can lead to nutrient inadequacy or nutrient deficiencies among the general population. Intakes of nutrients that are routinely below the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) can lead to a decrease in how much of the nutrient is stored in the body and how much is available for biological functions . DRIs are based on age and sex and include Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), Adequate Intake (AI), Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) and Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL). DRIs are established by the National Academies of Scie nce, Engineering and Medicine and include the following definitions: RDA - Indicates the average daily intake of particular nutrients to meet the requirements of 97 - 98% of healthy people. AI - Established to assume adequate intake when there is insufficient evidence to develop an RDA.06/2018 341 2 of 7 Clinical/Health/Medical: Nutrient Deficiency or Disease EAR - The a verage daily intake of a nutrient that is thought to meet the needs of 50% of healthy individuals. EARs are used to assess the adequacy of nutrient intakes among populations rather than the individual . UL - The highest nutrient intake that is considered to be safe and does not lead to adverse health effects in the general population ( 2). Macronutrient deficiencies include deficiencies in protein, fat, and/or calories, and can lead to stunting, pronounced wasting (marasmus) or a disp roportionately large abdomen (a sign of kwashiorkor) . Marasmus is a disease of severe wasting due to a prolonged inadequate intake of protein, carbohydrate, and fat. Kwashiorkor is a disease that results from a prolonged inadequate intake of protein. Essential f atty acid deficiencies, which would include omega -3 fatty acid deficiency, are thought to be rar e among the general population (3, 4). Signs of an essen tial fatty acid deficiency may include a dry scaly rash, decreased growth in infants and children, lowered immune response, and impaired wound heali ng (3). Micronutrient deficiencies would include deficiencies in vitamins and minerals in the body . According to National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data , the most common nutrient deficiencies from 2003 -2006 in the general United States population were vitamin B6, iron, vitamin D, vitamin C, and vitamin B12 ( 1). Because NHANES does not assess the status of all vitamins and minerals, there may be other micronutrient deficiencies that are present in the population without an estimated prevalence. According to NHANES data from 2005- 2012, a significant proportion of women who participate in WIC have inadequate nutrient intakes of vitamin E (96 -100%). Additionally, greater than 50% of pregnant women participants repo rted inadequate intakes of iron and between 10 -50% reported inadequate intakes of magnesium, folate, zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin B6 ( 5). Micronutrient deficiencies during pregnancy are not only a concern for the mother, but are of great concern to the developing f etus that is at risk of certain birth defects related to inadequate levels of certain nutrients including B vitamins, vitamin K, magnesium, copper, and zinc ( 6). Iodine deficiency during pregnancy can lead to irreversible adverse effects on fetal growth and development. Iodine deficiency is the leading cause of intellectual disability worldwide. According to NHANES data from 2005- 2008, 56.9% of the pregnant women surveyed had urinary iodine concentrations below the established threshold of 150mcg/L. Thi s finding suggests that greater than half of pregnant women have insufficient intakes of iodine ( 7). Because intake patterns of pregnant women can exclude or limit specific food groups, it is not uncommon to have multiple nutrient deficiencies during pregnancy (8). For example, iron deficiency usually does not occur alone, but it often occurs in conjunction with other vitamin and mineral deficiencies ( 9). Intakes of nutrients were also found to be low among postpartum and breastfeeding women participating in WIC. Among women who were breastfeeding and participating in WIC, more than 50% had inadequate intakes of vitamin A, and 10 -50% had inadequate intakes of magnesium, zinc, vitamin C, vitamin B6, folate, copper, and calcium (5). Greater than 50% of postpartum women who were not breastfeeding were found to have inadequate intakes of magnesium, vitamin A, and calcium, while 10- 50% had inadequate intakes of vitamin C, folate, copper, zin c, thiamin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, iron, and riboflavin ( 5). According to NHANES data from 2011- 2012, formula fed i nfants had an average usual intake of choline that was below the AI for that nutrient; however, intakes of other vitamins and minerals were estimated to be adequate ( 5). Intakes of v itamin D, iron , and zinc among breastfed infants can be of concern if appropriate and timely complementary foods and/or vitamin and mineral supplements are not provided to the infant. According to NHANES data from 2009 -2012, at least 10% of infants receiving human milk between 6 and 12 months of age had inadequate intakes of iron and zinc ( 5). Concentrations of vitamin D in human milk have 06/2018 3 of 7 341 Clinical/Health/Medical: Nutrient Deficiency or Disease been found to be low. Therefore, it has been recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) to provide all inf ants who are taking less than 32 ounces of formula a day a vitamin D supplement of 400 IU daily ( 10, 11). Additionally, infants who are born to mothers who are vitamin D deficient are more likely to be defi cient themselves. ( For more information s ee risk 411 Inappropriate Nutrition Practices for Infants .) For children participating in the WIC program, the prevalence of inadequate intakes of nutrients was found to be less than 5% for each nutrient, except vitamin E, which was found to be inadequate in the diets of 34.9% of children between 2 and 5 years of age (5). Additionally, it has been estimated that one in four children does not meet the RDA for iron, and one in ten does not meet the RDA for calcium ( 12). In addition to health risks associated with low nutrient status, some micronutrients pose a health risk at levels higher than the established UL. For this reason, individuals with nutrient deficiency diseases, or who are concerned that they may have a nutrient deficiency disease, should be followed by their medical provider (especially if supplements are required for treatment ). Populations who may be at greater risk of nutrient deficienc ies or diseases include: Individuals who have intakes below th e established RDA, AI, or EAR for the nutrient . Individuals who experience food insecurity . Individuals who are experiencing homelessness. Women who have a short interpregnancy interval. Individuals who have recently left their previous country of residence. P eople with a gastrointestinal disease that can limit absorption of nutrients (i.e. celiac disease or Crohn's disease) or individuals with a history of gastrointestinal surgery (including gastric bypass). For example, individuals who have had a portion of their stomach removed or their distal ileumremoved during a weight -loss or other surgery are at a greater risk of developing a v itamin B12 deficiency ( 13). Individuals with other medical conditions that influence nutrient status (i.e. cystic fibrosis, rena l d isease, genetic disorders) . Individuals on medications that are known to interact with the absorption or excretion of certain vitamins and minerals. P eople with substance use disorders (including alcohol) may be more likely to have deficiencie s d ue to poor intake and/or the effects of the substance . People who have high intakes of alcoho l a re at greater risk of developing a magnesium deficiency ( 14, 15). P eople who smoke are more likely to have a vitamin C deficiency due to the increase in oxidative stress. Nutrient deficiencies or diseases can be subclinical or clinical. Subclinical deficiencies involve changes to the concentrations of the micron utrient in the blood or tissues. Clinical deficiencies involve noticeable changes to the appearance of skin, nails, hair, oral cavity, and bone formation as well as major disturbances in the function of cells and tissues in the body . At either stage of a nutrient deficiency, blood work is often taken to confirm a deficiency. Blood work to detect nutrient deficiencies can be misleading, as some nutrients , such as magnesium , may have an overall deficiency in the body but be at a normal level in the blood ( 15). Other methods can be used to assess for nutrient defi ciency disease, such as a physical 06/2018 341 4 of 7 Clinical/Health/Medical: Nutrient Deficiency or Disease nutrition assessment . Because it can be difficult to be tested for, and diagnosed with, a nutrient deficiency or a nutrient deficiency disease can go undetected and untreated. The table below provides information regarding specific nutrients that are more commonly of co ncern among the WIC population; however, a dditional nutrient deficiency diseases may occur in the population. Detailed fact sheets about each nutrient can be found at the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements website : https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list -all/.

Implications for WIC Nutrition Services The WIC food package is designed to include foods that contain specific nutrients to improve the health status of program participants, address inadequate intakes, and , ultimately, prevent nutrient deficiencies. Nutrition education combined with the WIC food package can help decrease the likelihood that an individual would develop a nutrient deficiency or disease. For individuals who currently have a nutrient deficiency or disease, WIC staff can: Encourage improved intake of whole grains, legumes, dairy, lean protein, fruits , and vegetables. Emphasize appropriate portion size and variety to avoid nutrient to nutrient interaction. (For example, excessive calcium intake inhibits the absorption of iron.) Provide education on foods that contain the specific nutrient(s) of concer n. Provide education on preparing foods that are part of the WIC food package. Refer individuals who report food insecurity to appropriate re sources in the community like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (S NAP ) and/or food pantries . R einforce the medical and dietary treatment plans provided by the medical provider , and r efer parti cipants to medical providers for medical follow- up care. Refer individuals who smoke to tobacco cessation programs. References 1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Internet]. Georgia: [updated 2016 Mar; cited 2016 Dec 5].

Clarification Self-reporting of a diagnosis by a medical professional should not be confused with self -diagnosis, where a person simply claims to have or have had a medical condition without any reference to professional diagnosis. A self -report ed medical diagnosis (\"My doctor says that I have/my son or daughter has...\") should prompt the CPA to validate the presence of the condition by asking more pointed questions related to that diagnosis. 07/2009 1 of 4 342 Clinical/Health/Medical: Gastrointestinal Disorders 342 Gastrointestinal Disorders Definition/Cut-off Value Disease(s) and/or condition(s) that interferes with the intake or absorption of nutrients.

See Clarification for more information about self-reporting a diagnosis. Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I Non -Breastfeeding Women III, IV, V or VI Infants I Children III Justification Gastrointestinal disorders increase nutritional risk in a number of ways, including restricted food intake, abnormal deglutition, impaired digestion of food in the intestinal lumen, generalized or specific nutrient malabsorption, or excessive gastrointestinal losses of endogenous fluids and nutrients. Frequent loss of nutrients through vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption, or infections can result in malnourishment and lowered disease resistance (1, 2). Nutrition management plays a prominent role in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) GERD is irritation and inflammation of the esophagus due to reflux of gastric acid into the esophagus (3). Nutritional care of GERD includes avoiding eating within 3 hours before going to bed; avoiding fatty foods, chocolate, peppermint, and spearmint, which may relax the lower esophageal sphincter; and coffee and 07/2 009 342 2 of 4 Clinical/Health/Medical: Gastrointestinal Disorders alcoholic beverages, which may increase gastric secretion (4). Consumption of these items may need to be limited depending on individual tolerance. Peptic Ulcer Peptic ulcer normally involves the gastric and duodenal regions of the gastrointestinal tract (4). Because the primary cause of peptic ulcers is Helicobacter pylori infection, the focus of treatment is the elimination of the bacteria with antibiotic and proton pump inhibitor therapy. Dietary advice for persons with peptic ulcers is to avoid alcohol, coffee (with and without caffeine), chocolate, and specific spices, such as black pepper (4, 5). Post-bariatric Surgery Many types of surgical procedures are used for the intervention of morbid obesity. These procedures promote weight loss by restricting dietary intakes, e.g., adjustable gastric banding (AGB), and/or bypassing some portion of intestine to cause incomplete digestion and/or malabsorption of nutrients, e.g., Roux- y gastric bypass (RYGB). Therefore, the risks for developing nutritional deficiencies after bariatric surgery are greatly increased. Since gastric bypass individuals have both a decreased availability of gastric acid and intrinsic factor, vitamin B12 deficiency can develop without supplementation. Taking daily nutritional supplements and eating foods high in vitamins and minerals are important aspects of the nutritional management for the individuals who have had bariatric surgery (6). Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS) SBS is the result of extensive small bowel resection. SBS in infants is mostly the result of small bowel resection for the treatment of congenital anomalies, necrotizing enterocolitis, radiation enteritis, mesenteric vascular accidents, trauma, and recurrent intestinal obstruction are the most common conditions treated by small bowel resection and resulting in SBS (4). The loss of a large segment of the small bowel causes malabsorption syndrome. Total parenteral nutrition usually is started within the first few days after intestinal resection. Gradual supplementation with enteral feeding promotes intestinal adaptation in order to wean from parenteral nutrition therapy. Supplementation with fat soluble vitamins and vitamin B12 may be needed (7). The pediatric client's nutritional status must be assessed and growth closely monitored (8). Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Inflammatory bowel disease includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Weight loss, growth impairment, and malnutrition are the most prevalent nutritional problems observed in IBD. Nutritional support is essential. Exclusive elemental nutrition has been used in attaining the remission of Crohn's disease. However, symptoms tend to recur promptly after resuming the conventional diet (9). Liver Disease Since the liver plays an essential role in the metabolic processes of nutrients, liver disorders have far- reaching effects on nutritional status. Acute liver injury is often associated with anorexia, nausea and vomiting. Therefore, inadequate nutritional intakes are common. Decreased bile salt secretion is associated with the maldigestion and impaired absorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins. Defects in protein metabolism associated with chronic liver failure include decreased hepatic synthesis of albumin, coagulation factors, urea synthesis and metabolism of aromatic amino acids. For nutritional therapy, an important consideration should be the balance between preventing muscle wasting and promoting liver regeneration without causing hepatic encephalopathy. It is recommended that persons with chronic liver disease consume the same amount of dietary protein as that required by normal individuals (0.74g/kg) (10). 07/2009 3 of 4 342 Clinical/Health/Medical: Gastrointestinal Disorders Pancreatic Disease In chronic pancreatitis, there is a reduced secretion of pancreatic enzymes leading to malabsorption. In severe cases, tissue necrosis can occur. It is suggested that for patients with pancreatitis, a high carbohydrate, low-fat, low protein diet may be helpful (11). Biliary Tract Diseases Common diseases of the biliary tract are: Cholelithiasis (gallstones, without infection). Choledocholithiasis (gallstone in the bile duct causing obstruction, pain and cramps). Cholecystitis (inflammation of gallbladder caused by bile duct obstruction). Obesity or severe fasting may increase risk for these disorders. Since lipids stimulate gallbladder contractions, a low fat diet with 25% to 30% of total calories as fat is recommended. Greater fat limitation is undesirable as some fat is required for stimulation and drainage of the biliary tract. Supplementation with fat-soluble vitamins may be needed for persons with fat malabsorption or a chronic gall bladder condition (12). WIC nutritionists can provide counseling to support the medical nutrition therapy given by clinical dietitians, and monitor compliance with therapeutic dietary regimens. They can also review and provide WIC- approved medical foods or formulas prescribed by the health care providers. In certain circumstances, WIC staff may recommend an appropriate medical food or formula to the health care provider. They should also make referrals to an appropriate health care provider for medical nutrition therapy by a clinical dietitian when indicated. References 1. Institute of Medicine.

Presence of diabetes mellitus diagnosed, documented, or reported by a physician or someone working under a physician's orders, or as self reported by applicant/participant/caregiver. See Clarification for more information about self-reporting a diagnosis. Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I Non -Breastfeeding Women III, IV, V or VI Infants I Children III Justification Diabetes mellitus may be broadly described as a chronic, systemic disease characterized by: Abnormalities in the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and insulin; and Abnormalities in the structure and function of blood vessels and nerves (2). The chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes is associated with long-term damage, dysfunction, and failure of various organs, especially the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and blood vessels (1, 2) and includes type 1 diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY). MODY is a series of familial disorders characterized by early onset and mild hyperglycemia. Specific genetic defects have been identified on chromosomes 7, 12, and 20 (2). MODY is often diagnosed before the age of 25 years. It is caused by dominantly inherited defect of insulin secretion. Persons with MODY are often non- obese and without metabolic syndrome (3). The two major classifications of diabetes are type 1 diabetes (beta-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency); and type 2 diabetes (ranging from predominantly insulin resistance with relative insulin deficiency to a predominantly insulin secretory defect with insulin resistance) (1). The Expert Committee on Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus, working under the sponsorship of the American Diabetes Association, has identified the criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (1, 2) (see clarification). Long-term complications of diabetes include retinopathy with potential loss of vision, nephropathy leading to renal failure; peripheral neuropathy with risk of foot ulcers, joints; and, autonomic neuropathy causing gastrointestinal, genitourinary, symptoms sexual 07/2009 343 2 of 2 Clinical/Health/Medical: Diabetes Mellitus dysfunction. Patients with diabetes have an increased incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular, peripheral arterial and cerebrovascular diseases. Hypertension and abnormalities of lipoprotein metabolism are often found in people with diabetes (1). WIC nutrition services can reinforce and support the medical and dietary therapies (such as Medical Nutrition Therapy) that participants with diabetes receive from their health care providers (4).

A self- reported medical diagnosis (\"My doctor says that I have/my son or daughter has...\") should prompt the CPA to validate the presence of the condition by asking more pointed questions related to that diagnosis. Diabetes mellitus is sometimes described by both patients and health professionals as \"a little bit of sugar\" or \"high sugar. \" In reality, \"sugar\" is only one component of the pathology and clinical manifestations of the multifaceted syndrome of diabetes mellitus (2). Diabetes mellitus is diagnosed by a licensed medical provider using any one of the following three methods: 1. Fasting plasma glucose > 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmo1/L). Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 hours. 2. Symptoms of hyperglycemia plus casual plasma glucose concentration > 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmo1/L). Casual implies any time of day without regard to time since last meal. The classic symptoms of hyperglycemia include polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss. 3. Two -hour plasma glucose > 200mg/dL (11.1 mmo1/L) during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (1). In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, these criteria should be confirmed by repeat testing on a different day. The third measure (OGTT) is not recommended for routine clinical use. 05/2011 1 of 5 344 Clinical/Health/Medical: Thyroid Disorders 344 Thyroid Disorders Definition/Cut-Off Value Thyroid dysfunctions that occur in pregnant and postpart um women, during fetal development, and in childhood are caused by the abnormal secretion of thyroid hormones. The medical conditions include, but are not limited to, the following: Thyroid Dysfunction Definition Hyperthyroidism Excessive thyroid hormone production (most commonly known as Graves' disease and toxic multinodular goiter) . Hypothyroidism Low secretion levels of thyroid hormone (can be overt or mild/subclinical ). Most commonly seen as chronic au toimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's thyroiditis or autoimmune thyroid disease ). It can also be caused by severe iodine deficiency. Congenital Hyperthyroidism Excessive thyroid hormone levels at birth, either transient (due to maternal Grave's disease) or persistent (due to genetic mutation). Congenital Hypothyroidism Infants born with an under active thyroid gland and presume d to have had hypothyroidism in -utero. Postpartum Thyroiditis Transient or permanent thyroid dysfunction occurring in the first year after delivery based on an autoimmune inflammation of the thyroid. Frequent ly, the resolution is spontaneous . Presence of condition diagnosed, documented, or reported by a physician or someone working under physician's orders, or as self reported by applicant/participant/caregiver. See Clarification for more information about self-reporting a diagnosis. Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I Non -Breastfeeding Women III, IV, V or VI Infants I Children III 05/2011 344 2 of 5 Clinical/Health/Medical: Thyroid Disorders Justification The thyroid gland manufactures three thyroid hormones: thyroxine (T 4), triiodothyronine (T 3), and calcitonin. The thyroid hormones regulate how the body gets energy from food (metabolism). Iodine is an essential component of the T 4 and T 3 hormones (1) and must come from the diet. (Note: In nature, iodine does not exist as a free element; rather, it forms compounds such as sodium iodide (2, 3). For more information see Clarification section.) Iodine is available from various foods, and is present naturally in soil and sea water. A dysfunctional thyroid gland can become enlarged (goiter) as a result of an overproduction of thyroid hormones (hyperthyroidism) or conversely, from insufficient thyroid hormone production (hypothyroidism). Thyroid hormones influence virtually every organ system in the body. Maternal needs for dietary iodine and thyroid hormone medication (if prescribed) increase during pregnancy as maternal thyroid hormones and iodine are transferred to the fetus along with an increased loss of iodine through the maternal kidneys (3). Concurrently, the fetus is unable to produce thyroid hormones during the first trimester and is entirely dependent on the maternal supply of thyroid hormones. As a result, maternal production of T 4 must increase by at least 50% during pregnancy (4). If the pregnant woman is receiving thyroid hormone therapy, often a 30% - 50% increase in thyroid hormone medication is also needed. Hyperthyroidism Hyperthyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland is overactive, manufacturing too much thyroid hormone (T 4 and T 3). An excessive consumption of iodine (> 1000 \u00b5g/d) may cause fetal and maternal hyperthyroidism (5). In other circumstances, the thyroid might develop nodules which secrete excessive amounts of thyroid hormone regardless of iodine status (5). Enlargement of the thyroid gland (goiter) is a common symptom, as well as weight loss, fatigue, muscle weakness and an irregular heartbeat. Hyperthyroidism is relatively uncommon in pregnancy (4). However, when it occurs, uncontrolled hyperthyroidism (especially in the second half of pregnancy ) may result in infection, miscarriage, preterm delivery, preeclampsia, or congestive heart failure. Fetal complications may include prematurity, small for gestational age, fetal or neonatal thyrotoxicosis, or death (6). Postpartum maternal hyperthyroidism is likely in women with prenatal hyperthyroidism (7). The primary medical therapy for hyperthyroidism is radioactive iodine therapy which is contraindicated during pregnancy and lactation (7). If hyperthyroidism occurs during this period, low doses of thiomide (antithyroid drug) are given instead. Hypothyroidism Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone. Maternal and fetal hypothyroidism may occur when preconception maternal iodine stores are insufficient and there is inadequate maternal iodine intake in early pregnancy. In this instance, the maternal iodine balance may become negative and may never be restored, even with eventual iodine supplementation (4). Mothers with iodine deficiency during the first half of pregnancy may produce offspring with severe, irreversible brain damage (8). Maternal thyroid deficiency has been associated with neonatal developmental problems which may cause lasting changes in the brain structure and cognitive function. Uncontrolled hypothyroidism in the second half of pregnancy can cause maternal complications such as anemia, preeclampsia, miscarriage, premature delivery, and postpartum thyroid disease. Fetal or neonatal 05/2011 3 of 5 344 Clinical/Health/Medical: Thyroid Disorders complications include prematurity, low birth weight, congenital anomalies, poor neuropsychological development, and stillbirth (6). When iodine nutrition status is adequate, autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) - also called Hashimoto's thyroiditis - is the most common type of hypothyroidism during pregnancy (4). Pregnan t women with AI TD are at increased risk of miscarriage and postpartum thyroid disease (including thyroiditis, hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism). There is an increased risk of permanen t and significan t impairmen t in cognitive function for their infants (9). Congenital Hyperthyroidism and Hypothyroidism Congenital hyperthyroidism is rare in neonates . Transien t congenital hyperthyroidism is caused Graves disease . Thyroid stim ulating immunoglobu lin passes from the mother to the fetus v ia the placenta and causes thyrotoxicosis in the fetus and subsequently, the neonate . Afte r the baby is born, improvemen t is rapid if the condition is treated using antithyroid drugs and the hyperthyroidism will subside within severa l weeks (10). Persisten t congenital hyperthyroidism is a famil ial non-autoimmune disease . It is caused by a genetic mutation resulting in an increase in the constitutive activity of the TSH receptor (11). Congenital hypothyroidism due to maternal iodine deficiency is a leading cause of preventable mental disability (10). Over-treatment of thyroid hormone, during pregnancy, as well as prolonged maternal iodine therapy (more than two weeks of therapy or more than 1000 \u00b5g/iodine) can also cause congenital hypothyroidism (6). The condition is exacerbated by coexisting selenium and vitamin A deficiencies or iron deficiency (5). Treatment for neonatal hypothyroidism should be started as soon as possible, as every day of delay may result in loss of IQ. Unless treated shortly after birth (within the first 18 days of life), the resulting mental disability will be irreversible (10). Postpartum Thyroiditis Postpartum thyroiditis, an autoimmune inflammation of the thyroid, occurs within the first year after delivery or sometimes after termination of pregnancy . It can be a transien t thyroid dysfunction with a brief thyrotoxic phase follo wed by hypothyroidism, usually with a spontaneous resolution (10). Smoking is a significan t precipitating factor in the onset of postpartum thyroiditis (9). Women with a past history of postpartum thyroiditis have a risk of long-term permanen t hypothyroidism and recurrence of postpartum thyroiditis in subsequen t pregnancies (12). Tests for this condition consist of radioactive products necessitating a temporary cessation of breastfeeding (usually up to 3 days). Implications for WI C Nutrition Services Individuals with thyroid disorders can benef it from WIC foods and WIC nutrition services can reinforce and suppo rt the medical and dietary therapy prescribed by the participants' health care provid er. The following nutrition education messages may be appropriat e depending on the type of thyroid disorder: E ncourage iodine sufficiency, unless contraindicated, with an adequate intake of foods high in iodine such as iodized table salt, bread, saltwater fish, kelp, egg yolks (because of iodine supplementation in chicken feed), milk and milk products (because of the treatment of cows with supplemental dietary iodine) (5). It is important to note that the salt used in manufactured foods is not iodized. Advise women to review the iodine content of their prenatal supplement. It is recommended that all prenatal vitamin-mineral supplements for use during pregnancy and lactation contain at least05/2011 344 4 of 5 Clinical/Health/Medical: Thyroid Disorders 150 micrograms of iodine a day (13). Currently, less than 50 percent of prenatal vitamins on the market contain iodine (5, 7). Promote breastfeeding, as there are no contraindications to breastfeeding and thyroid hormone replacement therapy as long as normal thyroxine levels in the maternal plasma are maintained. Breast milk provides iodine to the infant and is influenced by the dietary intake of the pregnant and lactating mother (14). Hyperthyroidism can develop for the first time during the postpartum period, but the mother's ability to lactate is not affected. Ho wever, if a woman with untreated hypothyroidism breastfeeds, her milk supply may be insufficient. In such instances, replacement thyroid hormone therapy is necessary to help increase milk production. Weight management - hyperthyroidism: The elevated plasma levels of thyroid hormones may cause increased energy expenditure and weight loss along with increased appetite. Following medical treatment, individuals with hyperthyroidism usually regain their typical body weight with a concurrent decrease in appetite (4). Therefore, the monitoring of weight status and dietary adequacy are recommended. Weight management - hypothyroidism: Many individuals with hypothyroidism experience an increase in weight due to both a decrease in basal metabolic rate and an excessive accumulation of water and salt. Most of the weight gained is due to the excess water and salt retention. After medical treatment, a small amount of weight may be lost, usually less than 10% of body weight (15). Once hypothyroidism has been treated and thyroid hormones are within normal levels, it is less likely that the weight gain is solely due to the thyroid. If an overweight condition persists, weight control therapy may be necessary. Recommend the cautionary use of soy formula and the avoidance of foods or supplements rich in soy, fiber, or iron when therapeutic thyroid medications are prescribed, since soy, iron, calcium, fiber and phytates may interfere with the absorption of oral thyroid hormone therapy (16, 17). Discourage smoking as the compound thiocynate found in tobacco smoke inhibits iodine transport (9). References 1. National Academy of Sciences. Institute of Medicine. Food and Nutrition Board.

Iodine (I 2) is an element. In the ambient temperature, it is volatile and forms blue-violet gas. In nature, it does not exist as free element. Instead, it forms compounds, such as sodium iodide (NaI), and potassium iodide (KI). To prevent iodine deficiency, potassium iodide is added to the salt (most commonly to table salt) to form iodized salt (2 , 3). 05/2019 1 of 10 345 Clinical/Health/Medical: Hypertension and Prehypertension 345 Hypertension and Prehypertension Definition/Cut -off Value Hypertension is defined as high blood pressure which may eve ntually cause health problems and includes chronic hypertension during pregnancy, preeclampsia, eclampsia, chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia, and gestational hypertension (1, 2, 3) . Prehypertension is defined as being at high risk for developing hypertension, based on blood pressure levels. Presence of condition diagnosed, documented, or reported by a physician or someone working under a physician's orders, or as self-reported by applicant/participant/caregiver. See Clarification for more information about self -reporting a diagnosis. Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I Non -Breastfeeding Women III, IV, V or VI Infants I Children III Justification Hypertension (HTN) , commonly referred to as high blood pressure, occurs when the force of blood against artery walls is high enough that it may even tually cause health problems . Hypertension is measured in terms of both systolic blood pressure (pressure in blood vessels when the heart contracts) and diastolic blood pressure (pressure in blood vessels when the heart rests between contractions) . Two main factors in the body inc rease levels of blood pressure - a higher volume of blood being pumped by the heart and narrower arteries . Untreated HTN leads to many degenerative diseases, including congestive heart failure, end-stage renal disease, and peripheral vascular disease. People with HTN are often asymptomatic; diagnosis is based on measuring levels of blood pressure. (1) Blood pressure levels in adults are typically classified as follows, with the first number representing systolic blood pressure and the second number diastolic blood pressure (2, 3): Normal blood pressure: <120/<80 mmHg Hypertension: consistent readings of 140/ 90 mmHg About 75 million adults in the United S tates (1 in every 3) have HTN, and about the same number have prehypertension . Unfortunately, only half of adults in the United State s with HTN have their blood pressure under control, and HTN leads to at least 410,000 deaths in t he United States annually. (2) 05/201 9 345 2 of 10 Clinical/Health/Medical: Hypertension and Prehypertension Hypertension is considered either primary/essential (there is no identifiable cause) or secondary (the re is an identifiable caus e). Some identifiable causes include sleep apnea, kidney problems, diabetes, some tumors, thyroid problems, inflammation, and blood vessel defects. In addition , several medications (e.g., some birth control, cold medicines, decongestants, pain relievers) as well as illegal substances can signif icantly raise blood pressure . (1) Risk factors for HTN include the following (1, 2): Age ( Risk increases with age .) Race/ethnicity ( In the United States, people of African descent experience disproportionately higher rates of HTN compared to other races/ethnicities . Causes for this racial disparity in rates of HTN are complex and multifactorial [4, 5] .) Family history Overweight or obesity (This causes more blood to be pumped by the heart.) Physical inactivity (This is associated with a higher heart rate, which increases the force of blood against arteries.) Tobacco use (This increases blood pressure during use. Chemicals in tobacco also lead to narrowing of arteries.) Second -hand exposure to tobacco smoke Excessive sodium intake (This causes fluid retention, which increases blood pressure.) Inadequate potassium intake (This causes an excessive amount of sodium in the blood.) Excess ive alcohol intake (T his can damage the heart over time .) Stress Prehypertens ion Pregnancy Male gender Hypertension is a serious condition that can lead to a variety of health problems, including the following (1 , 3): Cardiac pathologies, including h eart attack, stroke, aneurysm, and heart failure Metabolic syndrome Chronic kidney disease Eye damage and vision loss Memory/understanding problems and dementia Gestational diabetes , preeclampsia, and perinatal mortality Management of HTN includes lifestyl e modifications and medication. In prehypertensive individuals , implementing lifestyle changes can prevent or delay the onset of HTN . In hypertensive individuals, d ietary intervention is not only effective in reducing blood pressure but a lso in delaying or avoiding drug treatment . Lifestyle changes to manage HTN and prehypertension include the following : 05/2019 3 of 10 345 Clinical/Health/Medical: Hypertension and Prehypertension Have blood p ressure checked at least yearly or as recommended by one's health care provider . For those at risk of HTN , regular monitoring of blood pressure is crucial. Blood pressure levels greater than 180/120 mmHg are extremely dan gerous and require immediate medical attention ( 3). Consume a diet consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans or follow the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan . Details regarding the DASH eating plan can be found on the Na tional Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's website, www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health -topics/dash -eating -plan . Engage in regular physical activity . Achieve and maintain a healthy weight . Limit alcohol and avoid any use of tobacco, marijuana or illegal substance s. If lifestyle changes alone do not sufficiently reduce blood pressure, medications may be prescribed. These include angiotensin -converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers, and /or diuretics (3). Pregnant Women Hypertension occurs in 6-8% of all pregnancies in the United States . Any HTN during pregnancy can lead to induction, and/or placental HTN during pregnancy can tighten the mother's blood vessels (including those in the umbilical cord), it can reduce oxygen and nutrients to the infant, potentially causing prematurity, low birth weight , and fetal growth restriction. (6) Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are categorized as follows : Chronic Hypertension during Pregnancy : o Definition: Hypertension is present before pregnancy or is diagnosed before 20 weeks gestation ( 6, 7). o It increases the risk of developing more severe HTN during pregnancy, gestational diabetes, and perinatal mortality . In infants, it may lead to fetal growth restriction and, additionally, exposure to antihypertensive medications may cause fetal growth restriction and malformation. ( 7) o Treatment includes frequent, regular monitoring of blood pressure . It is typically suggested that women with well -controlled blood pressure w ho exercised regularly before pregnancy continue moderate physical activity during pregnancy, unless contraindicated . Women should check with their healthcare provider for individual ized guidance . (7) Preeclampsia : o Definition: Onset of hypertension during pregnancy, typically with proteinuria, and usually after 20 weeks gestation. For some women, proteinuria does not occur; for these women, preeclampsia is diagnosed as hypertension with thrombocytopenia, impaired liver function, renal insufficiency, pulmonary edema, and/or ce rebral or visual disturbances . (7) 05/201 9 345 4 of 10 Clinical/Health/Medical: Hypertension and Prehypertension o The most common type of hypertensive disorder during pregnancy, preeclamps ia occurs in 3.4% of pregn ancies in the United States and is associated with one maternal death per 100,000 live births in developed countries (7, 8). Worldwide, it leads to the death of over 60,000 women annually (9 ). o Risk factors include history of preeclampsia , chronic HTN , chronic kidney disease, history of thrombocytopenia, in vitro fertilization, diabetes , auto -immune disorders (such as lupus ), uterine artery notching, family history of preeclampsia, obesity, polycystic ovarian syndrome, giving b irth for the first time, multifetal pregnancy, pregnancy interv al greater than 10 years, a nd being older than 40 years (6 , 7, 9, 10, 11). Low dietary and serum calcium levels are also associated with preeclampsia (9 ). o Clinic al signs include any of the fol lowing: proteinuria, low blood platelet count, abnormal kidney or liver function, and fluid in the lungs. Symptoms can include sudden weight gain, swelling of face or hands, upper abdominal pain, difficulty breathing, changes in vision ( including see ing spots) , severe headache, nausea, and/or vomiting. (7) o For pregnant women, preeclampsia can lead to pulmonary edema (fluid build -up in the lungs) , heart attack, stroke, acute respiratory distress syndrome (difficulty breathing due to fluid leaking into the lungs) , coagulop athy (blood unable to clot) , severe renal failure, retinal injury , liver rupture, placental abruption, hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells) , caesarean delivery, and/or death . Women w ith preeclampsia are at greater risk for postpartum depression, future HTN , heart attack, stroke, congestive heart failure, and metabolic disease; these risks increase with repeated incidence of preeclamp sia and with preterm delivery ( 7, 8, 10, 12 ). The infant of a woman with preeclampsia is at greater risk for caesarean delivery, preterm birth, low birth weight, small for gestat ional age, and/or stillbirth (8, 12 ). For the children of mothers who had preeclampsia, they are at heightened risk of bronchopul monary dysplasia (form of chronic lung disease) , cerebral palsy , cardiovascular dysfunction, learning disabilities, and lower IQ (10, 12 ). o Currently, there is inconclusive evidence on preventative measures for preeclampsia in future pregnancies. However , when dietary calcium is inadequate, research indicates adequate dietary calcium or supplementation (1 .5-2 grams/day) may help prevent preeclampsia ( 7, 8, 9, 13). Dietary folate and folic acid supplementation during pregnancy has also been associated wit h lower risk of preeclampsia (12, 14 ). o Treatment for preeclampsia depends on severity and other individual factors. For women with preeclampsia without severe features (hypertension with proteinuria after 20 weeks gestation) , the American College of Obst etricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) currently suggests that strict bed rest not be routinely prescribed (although there may be situations in which different levels of rest, including bed rest and hospi talization, may be indicated) ( 7). For women with sever e preeclampsia, treatment should occur in an inpatient setting, and ACOG recommends early delivery of the infant to prevent additional harm to the mother and infant ( 7, 10 ). The only known cure for preeclampsia during pregnancy is the d elivery of the infan t and placenta (10, 12). 05/2019 5 of 10 345 Clinical/Health/Medical: Hypertension and Prehypertension o It is important to note that postpartum preeclampsia can occur, regardless of whether it was present during pregnancy. It is usually diagnosed within 48 hours of delivery but can occur up to 6 weeks postpartum. Thus, women during this period should monitor for preecla mpsia symptoms and contact their healthcare provider immediately if they occur. (6, 7) Chronic Hypertension with Superimposed Preeclampsia : o Definition: Hypertension is present before pregnancy , and preeclamps ia develops during pregnancy. It is classified as either \"with severe features\" (hypertension with proteinuria before 20 weeks gestation with organ problems ) or \" without severe features\" (hypertension with proteinuria after 20 weeks gestation). ( 6, 7) Eclampsia: o Definition: Eclampsia is the presence of new -onset grand mal seizures in a woman with preeclampsia. Eclampsia can occur befor e, during, or after labor. It may be preceded by severe headaches , blurred vision, sensitivity to light, abdominal pain, hyperreflexia (over -reactive reflexes ), and altered mental status. (7) o Eclampsia is a critical situation and can lead to maternal death. Treatment typically includes parenteral magnesium sulfate in an inpatient setting. Once the mother's condition is stabilized, ACOG recommends the delivery of the infant. Treatment with magnesium sulfate may also be continued after delivery, if needed. (7) o Please note that due to the critical nature of eclampsia and its treatment in an inpatient setting, women with eclampsia are not encountered within a WIC setting. Gestational Hypertension : o Definition: Onset of hypertension during pregnancy, usually after 20 weeks gestation, and without p roteinuria . It usually resolves after delivery but does increase the risk of developing chronic HTN . (6) The term \"pregnancy -induced hypertension\" includes preeclampsi a, eclampsia and gestational hypertension. Please note that a low -sodium diet and/or weight loss is not recommended as treatment for HTN during pregnancy . Breastfeeding A systematic study done by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that there is an inverse relationship between duration of breastfeeding and HTN: the longer a woman breastfeeds, the less risk she has for developing HTN ( 15). Similarly, w omen with hypertension should be encouraged to breastfeed, unless contraindicated (16). If postpartum women require antihypertensive medications, medications should be chosen that are compatible with breastfeeding, if possible. It is thus very important for the mother to discuss her breastfeeding status and goals with her healthcare provider to determine the best infant feeding and medication plan . Children Hypertension among children is a serious condition and may eventually lead to hype rtension and chronic disease in adulthood. The definition of HTN is based on the normative distribution of blood pressure in healthy children. In 2017, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) updated their pediatric HTN 05/201 9 345 6 of 10 Clinical/Health/Medical: Hypertension and Prehypertension diagnostic tools to account for t he sex, age and height of the child. For more information about the definition and classifi cation of HTN in children see the AAP Clinical Practice Guideline for Screening and Management of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents : https://pediatric s.aappublications.org/content/140/3/e20171904 . Early d etection of high blood pressure in children is crucial for preventing future health concerns. Thus , the AAP recommends that blood pressure be measured annually once children are three years old. For children under three years of age, healthcare providers should measure blood pressure at every visit if the child has a risk factor for developing HTN. (17 ) The prevalence of HTN among children and adolescents in the United States is around 3.5% . About 2 -4% U.S. children and adolescents experience persistently elevated blood pressure. Higher rates are experienced by boys and among Hispanic and non -Hispanic African American children compared to white children. (17) For most children with HTN, there is no specific, identifiable cause (thus, it is considered primary HTN). Some children, however, do experience HTN as a direct result of medications, kidney disease, endocrine disorders, or congenital heart defects. Risk factors for elevated blood pressu re and HTN among children include the following (17): Family history of HTN, including maternal HTN during pregnancy Overweight and obesity (including high weight -for-length in infants) History of prematurity, low birth weight, and/or small for gestationa l age High sodium intake Hypertension during childhood has implications for both curr ent and long -term health. Health outcomes of HTN occurring in children may include the following (17): Dyslipidemia and cardiovascular damage Learning disabilities , and executive functioning In adulthood: HTN, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease For the management of HTN in children, the AAP recommends t he following lifestyle changes: Achieve and maintain a healthy weight -for-length or BMI (body mass index). Follow an age -appropriate DASH -type eating plan. Participate in m oderate to vigorous physical activity at least 3 -5 days per week, 30 -60 minutes per session. Get adequate sleep (more than 7 hours a night). For more informatio n about HTN among children, please see the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website High Blood Pressure during Childhood and Adole scence at: https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/youth.htm . Implications for WIC Nutrition Services The WIC Progra m provides support to participant s with hypertension/prehypertension by offering fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, low -fat dairy, and fish, which are important components of the 05/2019 7 of 10 345 Clinical/Health/Medical: Hypertension and Prehypertension DASH eating plan . WIC nutrition staff also offer nutritio n education and counseling as well as referrals to smoking cessation and substance use treatment if needed , which are critical to the management of hypertension/prehypertension. In addition, WIC staff can assist participant s by: For Pregnant Women with Hypertension: Asking probing questions to determine the type of hypertension they have been diagnosed with during pregnancy . Encouraging them to start prenatal care as soon as possible and to attend all health care appointments. Health status and blood pressure should be monitored frequently by healthcare provider. The h ealthcare p rovider may also recommend regular self -monitoring of blood pressure. Informing them of the symptoms of preeclampsia and of the importance of contacting their healthcare provi der immediately if they occur. Also, inform them that preeclampsia can occur postpartum. Counseling them on healthy weight gain , prenatal vitamin use, and a nutritious diet, including adequate calcium intake. For women with low calcium intake, refer them to their healthcare provider to discuss whether a calcium supplement is appropriate. Please note that a low - sodium diet and/or weight loss is not recommended as treatment for HTN during pregnancy . Encouraging them to discuss individualized p hysical activity recommendations with their healthcare provider. Informing them that hypertension during pregnancy increases their risk of future HTN, cardiovascular disease, and stroke. Providing information on avoiding any use of alcohol , tobacco, marijuana or illegal substances , as well as offering substance use referrals . The WIC Substance Use Prevention Manual is available for additional guidance and referral resources (https://wicworks.fns.usda.gov/resources/wic -substance -use-prevention -guide ). Referring to local home visiting programs for health monitoring and support , if available. For Postpartum Women with Hypertension: Asking probing questions to determine the type of hypertension they experienced during pregnancy and are now experiencing. Informing them of the symptoms of postpartum preeclampsia and of the importance of contacting their healthcare provider immediately if they occur. Providing breastfeeding promotion and support , unless contraindicated. Encourage women to discuss their breastfeeding status and goals with their healthcare provider , especially if medications are prescribed. Encouraging them to attend all health care appoin tments , including their 4 -6 week postpartum visit ; to develop a plan for future pregnancies; to discuss health conditions and medication needs with their healthcare provider ; and to have their BMI, blood pressure, lipids, and fa sting glucose assessed yearly (3 ). 05/201 9 345 8 of 10 Clinical/Health/Medical: Hypertension and Prehypertension Counseling them on achieving and maintaining a healthy weight, physical activity, following a diet consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans or the DASH diet. Providing information on avoiding any use of alcohol , tobacco, marijuana or illegal substances , as well as offering substance use referrals . The WIC Substance Use Prevention Manual is available for additional guidance and referral resources (https://wicworks.fns.usda.gov/resources/wic -substance -use-prevention -guide ). Referring them to their healthcare provider to discuss whether a calcium or folic acid supplemen t is appropriate, if intake of these nutrients seems inadequate. Referring to local home visiting programs for health monitoring and support , if available . For Children with Hypertension: Encouraging caregiver s to take children to all health care appointm ents. Counseling caregivers on : healthy pediatric weight gain and, for children with high weight -for- length or obesity, discussing strategies for achieving and maintaining a healthy weight ; age- specific, D ASH-type eating habits; and the importance of adequate sleep and physical activity in children .

See Clarification for more information about self-reporting a diagnosis. Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I Non -Breastfeeding Women III, IV, V or VI Infants I Children III Justification Epileptics are at nutrition risk due to alterations in nutritional status from prolonged anti-convulsion therapy, inadequate growth, and physical injuries from seizures (1). The ketogenic diet has been used for the treatment of refractory epilepsy in children (2). However, children on a ketogenic diet for six months or more have been observed to have slower gain in weight and height (3, 4). Growth monitoring and nutrition counseling to increase energy and protein intakes while maintaining the ketogenic status are recommended (4). In some cases, formula specifically prepared for children on a ketogenic diet is necessary. Women on antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) present a special challenge. Most AEDs have been associated with the risk of neural tube defects on the developing fetus. Although it is unclear whether folic acid supplementation protects against the embryotoxic and teratogenic effects of AEDs, folic acid is recommended for women with epilepsy as it is for other women of childbearing age (5-7). Oral motor dysfunction is associated with infants and children with cerebral palsy (CP). These infants and children often have poor growth due to eating impairment, such as difficulty in spoon feeding, biting, chewing, sucking, drinking from a cup and swallowing. Rejection of solid foods, choking, coughing, and 06/2007 348 2 of 3 Clinical/Health/Medical: Central Nervous System Disorders spillage during eating are common among these children (8, 9). Growth monitoring and nutrition counseling to modify food consistency and increase energy and nutrient intakes are recommended. Some children may require tube feeding and referral to feeding clinics, where available. Limited mobility or paralysis, hydrocephalus, limited feeding skills, and genitourinary problems put children with neural tube defects (NTDs) at increased risk of abnormal growth and development. Ambulatory disability, atrophy of the lower extremities, and short stature place NTDs affected children at high risk for increased body mass index (10). Growth monitoring and nutrition counseling for appropriate feeding practices are suggested. In some cases, participants with Parkinson's disease require protein redistribution diets to increase the efficacy of the medication used to treat the disease (11). Participants treated with levodopa-carbidopa may also need to increase the int ake of B vitamins (12). Participants with Parkinson's disease will benefit from nutrition education/counseling on dietary protein modification, which emphasizes adequate nutrition and meeting minimum protein requirements. Additionally, since people with Parkinson's often experience unintended weight loss (13), it is important to monitor for adequate maternal weight gain. Individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) may experience difficulties with chewing and swallowing that require changes in food texture in order to achieve a nutritionally adequate diet (14). Obesity and malnutrition are frequent nutrition problems observed in individuals with MS. Immobility and the use of steroids and anti-depressants are contributing factors for obesity. Dysphagia, adynamia, and drug therapy potentially contribute to malnutrition. Both obesity and malnutrition have detrimental effects on the course of the disease. Adequate intakes of polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin D, vitamin B 12 and a diet low in animal fat have been suggested to have beneficial effects in relapsing-remitting MS (15-17). Breastfeeding advice to mothers with MS has been controversial. However, there is no evidence to indicate that breastfeeding has any deleterious effect on women with MS. In fact, breastfeeding should be encouraged for the health benefits to the infant (18). In addition, mothers who choose to breastfeed should receive the necessary support to enhance breastfeeding duration. As a public health nutrition program, WIC plays a key role in health promotion and disease prevention. As such, the nutrition intervention for participants with medical conditions should focus on supporting, to the extent possible, the medical treatment and/or medical/nutrition therapy a participant may be receiving. Such support may include: investigating potential drug-nutrient interactions; inquiring about the participant's understanding of a prescribed special diet; encouraging the participant to keep medical appointments; tailoring the food package to accommodate the medical condition; and referring the participant to other health and social services.

Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I Non -Breastfeeding Women III, IV, V or VI Infants I Children III Justification For women, infants, and children with these disorders, special attention to nutrition may be required to achieve adequate growth and development and/or to maintain health. Severe cleft lip and palate anomalies commonly cause difficulty with chewing, sucking and swallowing, even after extensive repair efforts (5). Surgery is required for many gastrointestinal congenital atresia and trachea-esophageal fistula can lead to feeding problems during infancy. The metabolic consequences of impaired absorption in short bowel-syndrome depend on the extent and site of the resection or the loss of competence. Clinical manifestations of short bowel syndrome include diarrhea, dehydration, edema, general malnutrition, anemia, dermatitis, bleeding tendencies, impaired taste, anorexia, and renal calculi. Total parenteral feedings are frequently necessary initially, followed by gradual and individualized transition to oral feedings. After intestinal resection a period of adaptation by the residual intestine begins and may last as long as 12-18 months (3). Even after oral feedings are stabilized, close follow-up and frequent assessment of the nutritional status of infants with repaired congenital gastro-intestinal anomalies is recommended (5). Sickle-cell anemia is an inherited disorder in which the person inherits a sickle gene from each parent. Persons with sickle-cell trait carry the sickle gene, but under normal circumstances are completely asymptomatic. Good nutritional status is important to individuals with sickle-cell anemia to help assume 04/2001 349 2 of 2 Clinical/Health/Medical: Genetic and Congenital Disorders adequate growth (which can be compromised) and to help minimize complications of the disease since virtually every organ of the body can be affected by sickle-cell anemia (i.e., liver, kidneys, gall bladder, and immune system). Special attention should be given to assuring adequate caloric, iron, folate, vitamin E and vitamin C intakes as well as adequate hydration. Muscular dystrophy is a familial disease characterized by progressive atrophy and wasting of muscles. Changes in functionality and mobility can occur rapidly and as a result children may gain weight quickly (up to 20 pounds in a 6 month period). Early nutrition education that focuses on foods to include in a balanced diet, limiting foods high in simple sugars and fat and increasing fiber intake can be effective in minimizing the deleterious effects of the disease.

See Clarification for more information about self-reporting a diagnosis. Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Infants I Children III Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I Non -Breastfeeding Women III, IV, V or VI Justification The inheritance of most metabolic disorders is rare. IEM disorders may manifest at any stage of life, from infancy to adulthood. Early identification of IEM correlates with significant reduction in morbidity, mortality, and associated disabilities for those affected (1). All States screen newborns for IEM, although the type and number of IEM screened for may vary from State to State. Typically, infants are screened for amino acid disorders, urea cycle disorders, organic acid disorders, and fatty acid oxidation defects. A few States are working toward including lysosomal storage diseases and peroxisomal disorders among their newborn screening panels (2). 05/2011 351 2 of 6 Clinical/Health/Medical: Inborn Errors of Metabolism In most states, treatment of an IEM is referred to a specialized metabolic treatment facility. Please see Clarification for contact information for treatment facilities. IEM treatment is based on symptomatic therapy which may include the following strategies: substrate restriction; stimulation or stabilization of residual enzyme activity; replacement of deficient products; removal of toxic metabolites or blocking their production; and enzyme replacement therapy (3 ). Avoidance of catabolism is essential at all treatment stages. Nutrition therapy is integral to the treatment of IEM. Nutrition therapy should both correct the metabolic imbalance and ensure adequate energy, protein, and nutrients for normal growth and development among affected individuals. Continual monitoring of nutrient intake, laboratory values, and the individual's growth are needed for evaluation of the adequacy of the prescribed diet (4). It is important that caregivers of infants and children with IEM ensure that the patient follows the prescribed dietary regimen. The below embedded links provide the most up- to-date information about the disease state as well as treatment. Amino Acid Metabolism Disorders (3) Phenylketonuria (includes clinically significant hyperphenylalaninemia variants) Maple syrup urine disease Homocystinuria Tyrosinemia Amino Acid Metabolism Disorders are characterized by the inability to metabolize a certain essential amino acid. The build-up of the amino acid that is not metabolized can be toxic. Treatment of amino acid disorders involves restricting one or more essential amino acids to the minimum required for growth and development and supplying the missing product due to the blocked reaction. Carbohydrate Disorders (5) Galactosemia Glycogen storage disease type I Glycogen storage disease type II (See also Pompe disease ) Glycogen storage disease type III Glycogen storage disease type IV (Andersen Disease) Glycogen storage disease type V Glycogen storage disease type VI Fructose Intolerance kinase deficiency) This group of disorders includes an enzyme deficiency or its cofactor that affects the catabolism or anabolism of carbohydrate. Carbohydrate disorders are complex and affect neurological, physical, and nutritional status. Fatty Acid Oxidation Defects 05/2011 6 351 Clinical/Health/Medical: Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trifunctional protein deficiency type 1 (LCHAD deficiency) Trifunctional protein deficiency type 2 (mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency) Carnitine uptake defect (primary long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency Fatty acid oxidation defects include any defect in the process of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) system. The biochemical characteristic of all FAO defects is abnormal low ketone production as a result of the increased energy demands. This results in fasting hypoglycemia with severe acidosis secondary to the abnormal accumulation of intermediate metabolites of FAO, which can result in death . Organic Acid Disorders (AKA organic aciduria or Disorders are characterized by the excretion of non-amino organic acids in the urine. Most of the disorders are caused by a deficient enzyme involving the catabolism of specific amino acid(s). As a result, the non-metabolized substance accumulates due to the blockage of the specific metabolic pathway, which is toxic to certain organs and may also cause damage to the brain (7). Lysosomal Storage Diseases (6, 8 ) Fabry disease (-galactosidase A deficiency) Gauchers disease (glucocerebrosidase deficiency) Pompe disease (glycogen storage disease Type II, or acid -glucosidase deficiency) Lysosomal storage diseases are a group of related conditions characterized by increased storage of undigested large molecule in lysosomes. Lysosome is a cellular organelle responsible for intracellular degradation and recycling of macromolecules. Due to a defect in a specific lysosomal enzyme, the macromolecule that normally would be metabolized is not broken down; instead, it accumulates in the lysosomes. This leads to tissue damage, organ failures and premature death. Common clinical features include bone abnormalities, organomegaly, developmental impairment and central, peripheral nervous system disorders. Mitochondrial Disorders (6, 8) Leber hereditary optic neuropathy05/2011 351 4 of 6 Clinical/Health/Medical: Inborn Errors of are caused by the dysfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, or electron transport chain (ETC). Mitochondria play an essential role in energy production. The ETC dysfunction increases free radical production, which causes mitochondrial cellular damage, cell death and tissue necrosis and further worsens ETC dysfunction and thus forms a vicious cycle. The disorders can affect almost all organ systems. However, the organs and cells that have the highest energy demand, such as the brain and muscles (skeletal and cardiac) are most affected. The clinical features vary greatly among this group of disorders, but most have multiple organ dysfunctions with severe neuropathy and myopathy. Peroxisomal Disorders (6, 8, 9 ) Zellweger Syndrome Spectrum Adrenoleukodystrophy (x-ALD) There are two disorders: single peroxisomal enzyme deficiencies and peroxisomal biogenesis disorders. These disorders cause severe seizures and psychomotor retardation (9). Peroxisomes are small organelles found in cytoplasm of all cells. They carry out oxidative reactions which generate hydrogen peroxides. They also contain catalase (peroxidase), which is important in detoxifying ethanol, formic acid and other toxins. Single peroxisomal enzyme deficiencies are diseases with dysfunction of a specific enzyme, such as acyl coenzyme A oxidase deficiency. Peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are caused by multiple peroxisome enzymes such as Zellweger syndrome and neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy. Citrullinemia Argininosuccinic aciduria Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency Urea Cycle Disorders occur when any defect or total absence of any of the enzymes or the cofactors used in the urea cycle results in the accumulation of ammonia in the blood. The urea cycle converts waste nitrogen into urea and excretes it from the kidneys. Since there are no alternate pathways to clear the ammonia, dysfunction of the urea cycle results in neurologic damages. Implications for WIC Nutrition Services WIC can provide exempt infant formulas and WIC-eligible medical foods, including those specifically formulated for IEM. Most of the dietary regimens for IEM require a combination of medical food (special formula in most cases) and standard infant formula or prescribed conventional foods. For example, participants with IEM related to essential amino acid metabolism (such as PKU, MSUD), who are not developmentally ready for conventional food s; require both medical food without the offending amino acid(s), and human milk or standard infant formula. 05/2011 5 of 6 351 Clinical/Health/Medical: Inborn Errors of Metabolism It is recommended that WIC nutritionists collaborate with the clinical dietitians at the metabolic treatment facility, where available, to prescribe WIC food packages (Food Package III) according to the therapeutic diet ordered by the metabolic team, monit or the compliance of the restricted diet, and follow up on the growth and developmental status of the participants with IEM. Note: Infants with classic galactosemia cannot be breastfed due to lactose in human milk. References 1. Metabolic backgrounder: The Ross metabolic formula system for meeting special nutrition needs.

Infectious diseases come from b acteria, vi ruses, parasite s, or fungi and spread directly or indirectly from person to person (1) . Infectious disease s may also be zoonotic, which are transmitted from animals to humans , or vector -borne, which are transmitted from mosq uitoes, ticks, and fleas to humans (1, 2). These disease s and/or conditions include, but are not limited to (an e xtensive listing of infectious diseases can be found at: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/infections.html ): Most Common Acute Infectious Diseases Hepatitis A Listeri osis Hepatitis E Pneumonia Meningitis (Bacterial/Viral) Bronchitis (3 episodes in last 6 months) Parasitic Infections The infectious disease must be present within the past six months, and diagnosed, documented, or reported by a physician or someone working under a physician's orders, or as self -reported by applicant/participant/caregiver. See Clarification for more information about self -reporting a diagnosis. Participant Category and Priority L evel Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I Non -Breastfeeding Women III, IV, V, or VI Infants I Children III Justification Both chronic and acute infectious diseases can lead to: 1 ) poor appetite, 2) low nutrient absorption, 3 ) accelerated nutrient utilization, and/or 4) rapid nutrient loss, depending on the individual 's nutritional state before becoming infected and the indiv idual's diet during the improvement period (3). The following information pertains to some of the more prevalent and/or serious acute infectious diseases. VIRAL HEPATITIS Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver. It is most often caused by viruses, but can also be caused by excessive alcohol consumption, toxins, and medicines such as acetaminophen , as well as other medical conditions 06/2016 352a 2 of 8 Clinical/Health/Medical: Infectious Diseases - Acute linked to liver inflammation (4 ). Viral hepatitis is caused by a series of virus es labeled A, B, C, D, and E - with A, B, and C being the most common forms in the United States . Viral hepatitis A and E are the only forms that are acute and do not become chronic, whereas B, C, and D can bot h be acute and chronic in nature (5). (For more information on chronic infectiou s disease s see Risk #352b Infectious Diseases - Chronic. ) Regardless of the type of hepatitis, infected individuals with signs of the infection will typically experience anorexia, nausea, v omiting, diarrhea, jaundice, epigastria pain , tiredness, and weakness , all of which affect one's diet and health (5 ). In addition, darker urine and pale stools may be present in infected individuals . It is important to note that viral hepatitis is the leading cause of liver cancer and the most frequent need f or liver transplants in the United States (6 ). Hepatitis A : Hepatitis A is an acute infection caused by exposure to the Hepatitis A virus. It is transmitted through the fecal -oral route, with transmission most commonly spread through close contact with an infected household member or sexual partner. Outbreaks can also be caused by fecal -contaminated food or water. Because the symptoms of all types of acute hepatitis infections are the same , suspected diagnosis must be confirmed through either positive laboratory testing, or epidemiologic link to a confirmed case. (7) A large majority of those infected with Hepatitis A are a symptomatic, with 70% showing no clinical signs of infection. Hepati tis A does not progress to a chronic disease, and symptoms typically resolve without treatment in two months, however in 10 -15% of cases periodic relapses can occur for up to six months. (8) The Hepatitis A virus can survive for months outside of the body, therefore proper hygiene and food safety are important preventative measures. However , the most effective method of preventing infection is through vaccination, which has reduced the incidence of Hepatitis A by 95% since its introduction. Emphasis shou ld be placed on preventing an unvaccinated child from close personal contact with someone who is at high risk, or suspected of Hepatitis A infection. (7) Hepatitis E: Hepatitis E is an acute infection caused by exposure to the Hepatitis E virus. It is transmitted through the fecal -oral route, most commonly through ingestion of contaminated drinking water. However recent cases have been linked to uncooked/undercooked me at and shellfish, indicating the potential for foodborne exposure . While Hepatitis E is believed to be uncommon in the United States, those who frequently travel to developing countries with poor water and environmental sanitation are at risk of becoming infected. Diagnosis for Hepatitis E can be confirmed only by testing for the presence of antibodies to the virus or viral RNA. There are currently no serological tests approved for use in the United States. (9) Hepatitis E symptoms typically resolve on their own, and there is currently no therapeutic treatment or approved vaccine for the disease. Supportive therapy should be offered and hospitalization recommended for sever e cases. The predominant forms of prevention are good sanitation and only relying on clean drinking water when in areas at high risk for infection. (10) Pregnant women are especially at risk when infected with Hepatitis E. While in general most people will recover completely and the death rate among confirmed cases is about 1%, the mortality rate can reach 10- 30% for women in their third trimester. (9) MENINGITIS Characterized by an inflammation of the protective membranes known as the meninges, meningitis is typically caused by an infection of the fluid surrounding the brain and the spinal cord. Most commonly meningitis is caused by a bacterial or viral infection, but it can also result as a response to physical injury, cancer, or certain drugs. Due to the severity of meningitis and resulting treatment differing depending on the cause, it is important to correctly diagnose the agent responsible for the disease. (11) 06/2016 3 o f 8 352a Clinical/Health/Medical: Infectious Diseases - Acute Bacterial Meningitis : While most people with meningitis typically recover, bacterial meningitis is typically severe and can result in serious complications, including brain damage, hearing loss, or learning disabilities. The leading causes of bacterial meningitis in the United States of meningitis vary by age group. In adults, including pregnant women, it is most commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Listeria monocytogenes. The cause in newborns is most typically Group B Sterptococcus, E. coli, and Listeria. Infants and children most commonly develop meningitis in response to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae type b. (12) In addition, Cronobactor may cause severe meningitis in infants. Although Cronobactor infection is rare (the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports 4 -6 infections in infants per year), meningitis due to Cronobactor occurs almost exclusively among infants in the first 2 mo nths of life. Cronobactor infections have been associated with consumption of reconstituted powdered infant formula. In several outbreak investigations, Cronobactor has been found in powdered infant formula that had been contaminated in the factory. In other cases , the powdered infant formula might have been contaminated with Cronobactor after it was opened at home or elsewhere. It is recommended that manufacturer's preparation instructions be adhered to in order to prevent Cronobactor infection in infa nts consuming reconstituted powdered infant formula. (13) Risk factors for bacterial meningitis include, but are not limited to, age, with infants at higher risk than other age groups; congrega te living settings , with groups such as military personnel and college students at increased risk; medical conditions that weaken the immune system; and travel to the meningitis belt in sub-Saharan Africa. Transmission from an infected person usually requires prolonged, close, contact. Additionally, healthy people may carry the bacteria in their nose and throa t without developing an illness and most healthy people who carry the disease never become sick. Pregnant women infected with any of the bacteria responsible for causing meningitis are capable of passing the bac teria to their baby , putting them at increased risk of developing meningitis. (12) Meningitis symptoms are characterized by a sudden onset of fever, headache, and stiff neck. Other symptoms are also often present, including nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, and confusion. Diagnosis must be confirmed through laboratory testing of the blood or cerebrospinal fluid. Bacterial meningitis is effectively treated with antibioti cs, though it is important to begin treatment as early as possible. (12) The most effective method of preventing meningitis is vaccination. There are currently vaccines available for three types of meningitis causing bacteria - and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). Additionally for individuals in close contact with those with the disease, antibiotics may be recommended as a preventative measure. The risk of meningitis res ulting from Listeria can be prevented by properly preparing and refrigerating food as well as avoiding certain foods. Women diagnosed with group B strep are also given antibiotics during labor to prevent transmission to their newborn. (12) Viral Meningitis: Viral meningitis is the most common type of meningitis and is often less sever e than bacterial caused cases. In the United States it is most commonly caused by non- polio enteroviruses, as well as others including the mumps, herpes, measles, influenza, and a rboviruses. While few people infected with these viruses develop meningitis, the risk is especially high from summer to fall. Children younger than five and people with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of developing the disease, with infa nts younger that one month old and people with weakened immune systems more likely to develop severe illness. (14) 06/2016 352a 4 of 8 Clinical/Health/Medical: Infectious Diseases - Acute Transmission of a virus that can lead to meningitis may occur due to close contact with a person who has viral meningitis, however it is unli kely meningitis will develop. Symptoms in infants include fever, irritability, poor eating, sleepiness or trouble waking, and lethargy. Adults most commonly experience fever, headache, stiff neck, light sensitivity, sleepiness or trouble waking, nausea, vomiting, lack of appetite, and lethargy. As with bacterial meningitis, diagnosis requires lab tests to confirm the illness. (14) Typically viral meningitis resolves without treatment in 7- 10 days. However those with meningitis caused by the herpes virus or influenza may benefit from antiviral medication. While there are no vaccines available for the non -polio enteroviruses that can cause meningitis, the following steps can be taken to reduce the risk of infection: Washing hands often with soap and water, especially after changing diapers, using the toilet, o r coughing or blowing your nose. Avoiding fa ce touching with unwashed hands. Avoiding clos e contact with infected persons. Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched household surfaces. Stayin g home when sick . Additionally children should be vaccinated against the other viruses that can cause meningitis, including measles, mumps, chickenpox, and influenza . (14) LISTERIOSIS Listeriosis is infection caused by the bacteria Listeria monoc ytogenes . It is most commonly transmitted through contaminated food; however it is also naturally present in the soil, water, and animal s, including poultry and cattle (15 ). Listeria is especially dangerous due to its ability to grow in cold temperatures , unlike ma ny other pathogens (16). Common food sources include ready- to-eat deli meats and hot dogs, unpasteurized milk and dairy products, raw sprouts and others. Symptoms include fever, stiff neck, confusion, w eakness, vomiting, and diarrhea (17 ). Pregnant women and newborns are at exceptionally high risk for listeriosis , with pregnant women 10 -20 times as likely as the general population to become infected (18). It can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, or lifelong health issues for the child (19). Additionally , those with weakened immune systems are also at heightened risk. Listeri osis is treated with antibiotics and for severe cases referral to a medical facility may be necessary . The best methods of prevention are associated with proper food sa fety, handling, and storage. Additionally , raw milk and raw dairy products should be avoided. There is currently no vaccine available. (17) PNEUMONIA Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs that can cause mild to severe illness. It can be caused by virus es, bacteria, and fungi. In the United States the most common causes of viral and bacterial pneumonia are respiratory synctal virus (RSV) and Streptococcus pneumonia (pneumococcus), respectively, however Human Parainfluenza Viruses are the leading cause o f pneumonia in infants and children. Symptoms include fever, muscle aches, fatigue, enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, chest pain, s ore throat, coughing, shortness of breath, and r apid breathing . (20) Children younger than five years of age are considered at especially high risk of pneumonia. Additionally , pneumonia contracted during pregnancy has been associate d with increased morbidity and mortality when compared with non- pregnant women. It can lead to negative outcomes including low birth weight, increased risk of pre -term birth, and serious complications for the mother including respiratory failure. 06/2016 5 o f 8 352a Clinical/Health/Medical: Infectious Diseases - Acute Treatment includes administering antimicrobial and antiviral drugs depending on the pathogen respons ible for the infection. (21) Vaccination is an effective way to prevent pneumonia, with several vaccinations available for both bacteria and viruses including pneumococcal, Haemo philus influenzae type b (Hib), pertussis (whooping cough), varicella (chicken pox), measles, and influenza vaccines . Good hygiene is also another effective method of preve ntion, including regular hand- washing and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces. (20 ) BRONCHITIS Acute bronchitis is diagnosed by a healthcare provider based on the signs and symptoms present in the patient. It is a condition that occurs when the airways in the lungs swell and produce mucus, resulting in a cough. Bronchitis typically occurs after a chest cold and is usually caused by a virus, with the most com mon being: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Adenovirus, Influenza viruses, and parainfluenza. Symptoms include, but are not limited to coughing that produces mucus; soreness in the chest; fatigue; headache; body aches; fever; and sore throat. Most symptoms of acute bronchitis resolve on their own after two weeks, but the cough may last up to eight weeks in some cases. In severe cases, such as a fever above 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, patients should seek assistance from a health care provider. (2 2) Since bronchitis is almost never caused by bacteria, antibiotics are not needed or recommended. Furthermore, antibiotic treatment may cause harm in both children and adults (20). The best course of action is to provide symptom relief through rest, over -the-counter medicines, and other self -care methods. It is important to use pain relievers appropriate for the age of the child, and only acetaminophen for babies six months of age and younger (2 3). Bronchitis may be prevented by avoiding smoking, practicing go od hygiene, and remaining current on all immunizations (22). PARASITIC INFECTIONS Parasites are organisms that live on or in a host organism and survive by getting their food at the detriment of the host. Pregnant women and children are most at risk from certain types of parasites including Toxop lasma gondii lasma gondii , is considered to be the leading cause of death attributed to foodbor ne illness in the United States (25). To reduce the risk of parasitic infection, prevention includes good food safety and general good hygiene. Additionally environmental risk can be reduced by wearing gloves when coming into contact with soil, covering sandboxes, and teaching children the importance of hand washing (26). Most healthy people will recover from parasites without treatment. However for pregnant women, newborns, and infants with toxoplasmosis, treatment can be administered as a combination of drugs such as pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, plus folinic acid (27). This treatment will reduce the parasitic burden, but will not eliminate it completely as parasites can remain in tissues , which makes it hard for the medication to reach them. Lice and other dermal parasites can be treated with topical drugs, such as medicated shampo o (24). Implications for WIC Nutrition Services WIC can improve the management of acute infectious diseases through WIC foods, nutrition education, counseling, and referrals to community resources . The table below provides additional WIC nutrition services recommendations specific to the disease state that can help improve the health outcom es of participants with acute infectious diseases: 06/2016 352a 6 of 8 Clinical/Health/Medical: Infectious Diseases - Acute WIC Nutrition Services Recommendations for Acute Infectious Diseases (9,10) All Types of Infections Encourage sufficient calorie intake to ameliorate accelerated nutrient utilization. Recommend the Dietary Guidelines to ensure healthy eating patterns . Provide suggestions to address poor appetite. Provide education on safe food handling and storage practices. All Types of Hepatitis Recommend testing to pregnant women and high risk individuals. Encourage abstinence from alcohol. Provide information on high calorie, high protein and moderate fat diets . Recommend high calorie consumption at breakfast as nausea is less common in the morning. Recommend, in consultation with health care provider, consumption of high calorieand protein liquid formula between meals to boost calorie intake. Encourage a bland diet with extra fluids depending on the severity of nausea a nd v omiting. Hepatitis A Encourage the Hepa titis A vaccine for all children , previously unvaccinate d a dolescents through the age of 18, and high- risk adults. Promote breastfeeding as being safe, but to avoid breastfeeding when nipples arecracked and bleeding - at which time, mothers should pump and discard milk to maintain supply. Discourage the practice of pre -chewing food for infants, as blood may be present. Hepatitis E Avoid contaminated water . Meningitis Encourage vaccination s for both bacteria and viruses known to cause meningitis . Provide education on proper food handling and storage practices . Recommend use of manufacturer's instruction for the preparation of infantformula. Provide education on good hygiene practices . Listeriosis Recommend alternatives to raw milk and dairy products . Emphasize importance of safe food handling, preparation and storage practices. Pneumonia Recommend referral to a healthcare provider to administer appropriat e antimicrobial or antiviral treatment . Bronchitis Provide education on symptom relief and proper pain- medication practices for children . Recommend smoking cessation . Provide education on good hygiene practices . Encourage appropriate vaccinations. Parasitic Infections Recommend appropriate measures be taken when coming into contact wit h po tential environmental contaminants , e.g., use of gloves when working with soil and covering sandboxes when not in use. Provide education on proper food handling and storage practices . Provide education on good hygiene practices . 06/2016 7 o f 8 352a Clinical/Health/Medical: Infectious Diseases - Acute References 1.

A self -reported medical diagnosis (\"My doctor says that I have/my son or daughter has...\") should prompt the CPA to validate the presence of the condition by asking more pointed questions related to that diagnosis. 06/2016 1 of 9 352b Clinical/Health/Medical: Infectious Diseases - Chronic 352b Infectious Diseases - Chronic Definition/Cut- off Value Conditions likely last ing a lifetime and require long-term management of symptoms . Infectious diseases come from b acteria, viruses, parasite s, or fungi and spread directly or indirectly, from person to person (1) . Infectious disease s may also be zoonotic, which are transmitted from animals to humans , or vector -borne, which are transmitted from mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas to humans (1, 2 ). These diseases and/or conditions include, but are not limited to (an extensive listing of infectious diseases can be found at: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/infections.html ): Chronic Infectious Diseases * HIV Human Immunodeficiency Virus Hepatitis B AIDS Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Hepatitis C Hepatitis D Presence of condition diagnosed, documented, or reported by a physician or someone working under a physician's orders, or as self reported by applicant/participant/caregiver.

Participant Category and Priority L evel Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I Non -Breastfeeding Women III, IV, V, or VI Infants I Children III Justification Both chronic and acute infectious diseases can lead to: 1 ) poor appetite, 2) low nutrient absorption, 3 ) accelerated nutrient utilization, and/or 4) rapid nutrient loss, depending on the individual 's nutritional state before becoming infected and the individual's diet during the improvement period (3). The following information pertains to some of the more prevalent and/or serious chronic infectious diseases. Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV)/ Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS) The Huma n Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a chronic virus that reduces an individual's ability to fight off infections and diseases (4). HIV destroys white blood cells found in the immune system, also known as CD4 06/2016 352b 2 of 9 Clinical/Health/Medical: Infectious Diseases - Chron ic (cluster of differentiation ) or T cells (T lymphocytes) (5) . HIV is transmitted only through blood, semen, pre - seminal fluid, rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk from an HIV -infected person ( 6). HIV can lead to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) if left untreated (4). Individuals who are aware of their HIV status and are undergoing antiretroviral therapy (ART) to stop the replication of the virus , can typically live decades - while those unaware of their status or are not on ART , can usually remain in this stage about ten years before progressing to the AIDS stage. S ome individuals may progress to the AIDS stage sooner than 10 years . During t he time period a person progresse s from HIV to AIDS, the immune system become s extremely weakened and can no longer protect against other infections or opportunistic illnesses ** - which are infections generally not detrimental to healthy individual s, but can be life -threatening in people infected with HIV. A person with AIDS and an opportunistic illness that goes untreated has a life expectancy of approximately one year (4). Getting tested is the only way individual s know they are infected with HIV . Many people infected with the virus display no symptoms for as long as ten years or more. The C enters for Disease C ontrol and Prevention (CDC) currently estimates that 1 in 6 people in the United States infected with HIV do not know they have the virus and therefore recommend s that everyone between the ages of 13 -64 get tested at least once a s p art of a regular health screening. The CDC further recommends that all pregnant women be tested early in their pregnancy, via an \" opt- out\" testing measure - which is when p regnant women are told that an HIV test will be included in the standard group of prenatal tests and that they may decline the test. Unless the HIV test is specifically decline d, they will be tested for the virus . (7) An early diagnosis in pregnant women can reduce the transmission of HIV in babies to 2 %, if the expectant mother (8): Receives Active Antiretroviral Therapy ( ART) during pregnancy, labor, and delivery. Deliver s the baby by cesarean, or C -section . Avoid s breastfeeding . There is a 20% chance of transmission if the HIV positive , expectant mother does none of the prevention measures listed above (8). In addition, women living in certain geographic areas or women considered high risk, such as those with sexually transmitted infections , multiple partners, or have substance abuse issues, are encouraged to be retested in the third trimester , preferably when less than 36 weeks pregnant (9). PrEP ( Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis) is a daily pill containing two medicines (tenofovir and emtricitabine), recommended for HIV negative peo ple who are at substantial risk of becoming infected with HIV. PrEP, when taken consistently, reduces HIV transmission by up to 92%, and is recommended for (10): Individuals in an HIV discordant relationship in which one partner is HIV positive and the other partner is HIV negative . Heterosexual women who do not regularly use condo ms with sex partners of unknown HIV status. Women who share injectable drug paraphernalia or were in treatment for injectable drug use i n t he past six months . ** Extensive listing of opportunistic illness can be http://womenshealth.gov/hiv - aids/opportunistic -infections -and-other -conditions/ . HIV/AIDS and Nutrition : Dietary needs for an HIV positive individual are determined by the presence of symptoms (11, 12 ). Symptomatic individuals experiencing unintended weight loss, or wasting , and are dealing with : 1) poor food intake due to medication side effects, sore mouth, or mental health issues; 2) 06/2016 3 o f 9 352b Clinical/Health/Medical: Infectious Diseases - Chronic altered metabolism due to disease progression; or 3) nutrient malabsorption caused by gast rointestinal problems resulting from medications or just the presence of th e virus. In symp tomatic participants, the main goals are to: 1) increase o r maintain a normal body weight; 2) retain or increase lean body mass; and 3)en sure adequate intake of macro - and micronutrients. In most cases, these individuals usually require diets higher in protein and potentially a multivitamin, as vitamins A, B 6, C, and E are lower in symptomatic people. In instances when wasting cannot be alleviated through regular dietary means, enteral a nd pa renteral nutrition therapy may be necessary. For asymptomatic individuals or those with a stabl e wei ght, the goals should focus on adequate intake of nutrients to prevent wasting - and if food intake is low, these individuals could potentially include a multivitamin or mineral supplement to avoid deficiencies (11, 12) . I t is important to note that taking large amounts of iron supplements , leading to iron -overload , encourages disease progression from HIV to AI DS, and should be avoid ed. In addition, Vitamin A and Zinc, in the form of supplements, can have a negative impact on adults living with HIV/AIDS (12). Participants should always consult with their health care providers before taking dietary supplements over the Recommended Dietary Allowance to prevent adverse reactions and interactions with medications used to treat HIV/AIDS. (13) HIV/AIDS Medication Nutrition al Problems : Even though people with HIV are able to manage the disease and live longer with Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) , the side effects can have a negative impact on a person's nutritional status . Common side effects include: gastrointestinal problems, lipid disorders, and insuli n resistance/glucose intolerance. Participants ex periencing these problems should: reduce t otal fat intake and cholesterol; increase dietary fiber; increase physical activity; reduce alcohol consumption; and reduce the consumption of simple sugars . (11, 12) HIV/AIDS and Food Safety : Participants living with HIV are more susceptible to contracting a food -borne illness due to weakened immune system s and therefore should be encouraged to : store and prepare foods safely; check expiration dates; and avoid raw or semi raw foods, such as meat, non -past eurized dairy, and soft cheeses (11, 12). Infants born to HIV positive mothers, regardless of their HIV status, should drink ready -to-feed or liquid concentrate infant formula as powdered infant formula is not sterile and may not be microbiological safe (14). HIV/ AIDS Care and Support : HIV-affected families often experience a lack of financial and psychosocial support needed to deal with an HIV/AIDS diagnosis, including the effects of social stigma which negatively impacts their ability to comply with th e medical treatment needed to contr ol the disease (15). Further, to fully benefit from current treatment protocols required to manage HIV and reduce the progression to AIDS, infected individuals who know their status, must get care, stay in care, and adhere to an effective antiretroviral treatment plan known as an HIV/AIDS Care Continuum (16). WIC agencies should proactively refer participants to health care services and various community resources, including other FNS nutrition assistance programs, to improve health outcomes among HIV -infected WIC participants. Implications for WIC Nutrition Services WIC can improve the management of chronic infectious diseases through WIC foods, nutrition education, counseling, and referrals to community resources that provide support in the long -term management of chronic infectious diseases. HIV/AIDS The table below summarizes the WI C Nutrition Services that can help improve the health and birth outcomes of participants with HIV/AIDS. 06/2016 352b 4 of 9 Clinical/Health/Medical: Infectious Diseases - Chron ic Participant Category WIC Nutrition Services Recommendations for HIV/AIDS ALL CATEGORIES NUTRITION AND HEALTH TIPS TO MANAGE HIV/AIDS SYMPTOMS (12, 17, 18, 19) U se MyPlate as the guide for dietary needs. Consult health care providers when using supplements and herbs to avoid adverse reactions or medication interactions that could reduce effectiveness. Eat small, frequent meals when gastrointestinal problems are present or persistent . Eat soft foods with manageable textures at tolerable temperatures when oral lesions and dental problems are present (i.e. mashed potatoes, scrambled/boiled eggs, bananas, non-citrus juices, puddings, custards, milk , cooked vegetables, rice, oatmeal, non -fizzy drinks, cottage cheese, non -spicy foods) . Add canned tuna, beans, cheese, peanut butter, dried milk for inexpensive extra protein . Add moderate amounts of concentrated sources of calories to diet when needed (e.g., butter, cream cheese, gravies, whole milk, ice cream) . Consume nutritious, high c aloric foods when appetite is normal or has returned . Drink adequate water to stay hydrated, replace fluid loss from diarrhea a nd v omiting, and help medications move through the body. Consume foods high in fiber or fiber supplements to slow digestion if foods ar e m oving too quickly through the body. Eat yogurt or foods with Lactobacillus acidophilus culture to help with bacterial over -growth resulting from prolonged use of antibiotics. Avoid caffeinated beverages to prevent dehydration . A void or reduce sugar -free foods with sorbitol as diarrhea may be exacerbated . Consult with health care provider about use of complete oral nutritional supplements to help nutritional status . Avoid alcohol and illegal drugs for overall good health and to help protect theliver. Use pancreatic enzymes when medically prescribed to help with digestion. Prepare and store food safel y. Avoid expired and moldy foods or foods with rotten spots. Participate in weight -bearing exercises to strengthen and maintain bones . Refer HIV -affected families to other community resources for food, housing, a nd med ical resources to improve compliance with HIV treatment. W OMEN Encourage all women to be tested to prevent mother -to-child HIV transmission through delivery and breastfeeding (7) . Women who are considered high risk, such as those with sexually transmitted infections, multiple partners, or havesubstance abuse issues, are encouraged to be retested during late ges tation, preferably before 36 weeks (9). Note: HIV testing is not a standard medical tes t a dministered to pregnant women in many states, in addition, pregnant wome n c an opt -out in those states in which HIV testing is part of the standard test. Therefore, WIC can impact the spread of HIV/AIDS by making referrals to participants for early and late gestation testing, given that some populationsserved by WIC are most at risk for contracting HIV (7). 06/2016 5 o f 9 352b Clinical/Health/Medical: Infectious Diseases - Chronic Participant Category WIC Nutrition Services Recommendations for HIV/AIDS W OMEN (Continued) Advise infected pregnant women to consume a diet adequate in nutrients, achieve appropriate weight gain, and discuss taking a multivitamin with their health care provider (11). Educate mothers with HIV/AIDS to avoid breastfeeding. This is especially important for recent immigrants and refugees from developing nations, as the recommendations are different in developing countries (15). In some developing countries, breastfeeding is encouraged due to the lack of available clean water to prepare infant formula and other sanitation problems ). More information about w omen and HIV can be found at: o http://www.womenshealth.gov/hiv -aids/ o http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/gender/pregnantwomen/facts/ INFANTS Inform mother s/caregiver s that f ormula feeding is the standard for infants bor n to HIV positive mothers in the United States as breastfeeding is no t r ecommended - especially to the immigrant and refugee population (13). Ensure that liquid concentrate , or ready -to-feed i nfant formula , prescribed with medical documentation, is provided to HIV -exposed infants or babies born t o H IV positive mothers, even if the infant has tested negative for HIV . Powdered infant formula is not sterile and therefore may not be microbiologically safe for immune -compromised participants (14). Discourage giving pre-chewed food, regardless of HIV status, as the individual's HIV status, who is pre -chewing the food is unknown (6). More information about i nfants and HIV can be found at: o http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/gender/pregnantwomen/facts/ CHILDREN Discourage giving pre -chewed food, regardless of HIV status, as the individual's HIV status, who is pre -chewing the food is unknown (6) More information about c hildren and HIV can be found -aids-basics/just -diagnosed -with -hiv- aids/overview/children/ VIRAL HEPATITIS Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver. It is most often caused by viruses, but can also be caused by excessive alcohol consumption, toxins, and medicines such as acetaminophen , as well as other medical conditions linked to liver inflammation (20). Viral hepatitis is caused by a series of virus es labeled A, B, C, D, and E with A, B, and C being the most common forms in the United States . Viral hepatitis A and E are the only forms that are acute and do not become chronic, whereas B, C, and D can bot h be acute and chronic in nature (20). Regardless of the type of hepatitis, infected individuals with signs of the infection will typically experience: anorexia, nausea , vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, epigastria pain , tiredness, and weakness, all of which affect one's diet and health (21) . In addition, d arker urine and pale stools may be present in infected individuals . It is important to note that viral hepatitis is the leading cause of liver cancer and the most frequent need for liver transplants in the United States (22) . Hepatitis B : Hepatitis B is both acute and chronic, and is tra nsmitted through contact with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected blood, sexual intercourse with an infected person, and from mother to child by both va ginal or cesarean section births (20) . Those at higher risk of becoming infected with hepatitis B are those: living 06/2016 352b 6 of 9 Clinical/Health/Medical: Infectious Diseases - Chron ic with a hepatitis B infected person; coming into contact with blood, needles, or body fluids through work ; working or living in a prison system ; from Asian and Pacific Islands nations ; undergoing kidney dialysis; infected with HIV or hepatitis ; and who have an immigrant or refugee status (21). Treatment for Hepatitis B involves the use of interferon and antiviral drugs to interfere with the course of the virus . Early diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis B can help prevent damage to the liver. In addition, the Hepatit is B vaccination can prevent Hepatitis B . (22) Hepatitis B is not spread through human milk. Given that Hepatitis B is spread through blood, moth ers who breastfeed should care for their nipples to avoid cracking and bleeding. If a mother with Hepatitis B has cracked and bleeding nipples, she should temporarily stop breastfeeding until her nipples heal - but continue to pump and discard pumped milk to maintain her milk supply (23). If a mother with HBV has concerns with providing her milk to her infant or concerns with drug treatment for the HBV , she should consult her physician. Hepatitis C: Hepatitis C is both acute and chronic ; however, most cases are chronic and commonly spread through sharing needles during intravenous drug use (20). It can also sp read through sexual intercourse; having a blood transfusion or organ transplant before July 1992 ; or using the razor, toothbrush, or nail clippers of an infected perso n. Being i nfected with a sexually transmitted disease or HIV can increase the chances of becoming infected with Hepatitis C. G etting tattoos and body piercings from unlicensed facilities, in casual settings, or with the use of non- sterile instruments can also transmit Hepatitis C (20). By the time symptoms appear with hepatitis C, the liver has been damaged , which in most cases can be as long as ten years after being infected. There is no vaccine for Hepatitis C. Medicines are used to slow or stop the v irus from damaging the liver in chronic hepatitis. Severe damage to the liver leading to failure may require a liver transplant . (20) Infants born to mother s with hepatitis C can become infected; however, breas tfeeding is not contraindicated, as Hepatitis C is not transmitted through human milk, unless the mother's nipples are cracked and bleeding . (See information above in Hepatitis B about breastfeeding with cracked and/or bleeding nipples.) Hepatitis D : Hepati tis D is both acute and chronic. Though not common in the United States, viral hepatitis D can only be contracted when an individual also has hepatitis B (20, 22) . The virus is present in blood and other body fluids o f infected persons and is most commonly transmitted thro ugh: enga ging in sexual activity ; mother to child during delivery; sharing injection drug paraphernalia, razors, or toothbrushes; or coming in direct contact with t he blood of an infected person. Chronic hepatitis D resulting from a super - infection , in which an individual has chronic hepatitis B , can progress to end -stage liver diseases (cirrhosis) or liver cancer. In some patients, i nterferon may be us eful for treating hepatitis D. Although no vaccine exist for Hepatitis D, it can be prevented in persons who do not have Hepatitis B, by getting the Hepatitis B vaccination (20, 22) . Implications for WIC Nutrition Services WIC can improve the management of chronic infectious diseases through WIC foods, nutrition education, counseling, and referrals to community resources that provide support in the long -term management of chronic infectious diseases. 06/2016 7 o f 9 352b Clinical/Health/Medical: Infectious Diseases - Chronic HEPATITIS The table below summarizes the WIC Nutrition Services recommendations that can help improve the health outcomes of participants with Hepatitis. Type s of Hepatitis WIC Nutrition Services Recommendations for C hronic Hepatitis (24, 25) All Types Recommend testing to pregnant women and high risk individuals. Encourage abstinence from alcohol. Provide information on high calorie, high protein and moderate fat diets . Recommend high calo rie consumption at breakfast to mitigate nausea. (Typically nausea is less common in the morning.) Recommend, in consultation with health care provider , consumption of high calorie and protein liquid formula between meals to boost calorie intake. Encourage a bland diet with extra fluids depending on the severity of nausea and vomiting. Hepatitis B Encourage t he Hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns , previously unvaccinate d adolescents through the age of 18, and high- risk adults . Promote breastfeeding as being safe, but to avoid breastfeeding when nipples are cracked and bleeding - at which time, mothers should pump and discard milk to maintain supply. Discourage the practice of pre -chewing food for infants, as blood may be present . Hepatitis C Promote breastfeeding as being safe, but to avoid breastfeeding when nipples are cracked and bleeding - at which time, mothers should pump and discard milk to maintain supply. Hepatitis D Recommend Hepatitis B vaccine . References 1. Worl d Health Organization. Health topics: infectious disease. [cited 2015 May 15].

(1) Presence of condition diagnosed, documented, or reported by a physician or someone working under a physician's orders, or as self reported by applicant/participant/caregiver. See Clarification for more information about self-reporting a diagnosis. Participant Category and Priority L evel Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I Non -Breastfeeding Women III, IV, V, or VI Infants I Children III Justification The actual prevalence of food allergies is difficult to establish due to variability in study designs and definitions of food allergies; however recent studies suggest a true increase in prevalence over the past 10 to 20 years (1). A meta-analysis conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) found the prevalence of food allergy among all age groups between 1-10% (2). Further research has found that food allergy affects more children than recently reported with the prevalence estimated to be 8 % (2). Food allergies are a significant health concern as they can cause serious illness and life-threatening reactions. Prompt identification and proper treatment of food allergies improves quality of life, nutritional well-being and social interaction. Food allergy reactions occur when the body's immune system responds to a harm less food as if it were a threat (3). The most common types of food allergies involve immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated responses. The immune system forms IgE against offending food(s) and causes abnormal reactions. IgE is a distinct class of antibodies that mediates an immediate allergic reaction. When food allergens enter the body, IgE antibodies bind to them and release chemicals that cause various symptoms. (1) According to an expert panel sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease , individuals with a family history of any allergic disease are susceptible to developing food allergies and are classif ied as \"at risk\" or \"high risk.\" Individuals who are \"at risk\" ar e those with a biological parent or sibling with existing, or history of, allergic rhinitis, asthma or atopic dermatitis. Individuals who are \"high risk\" are those with preexisting severe allergic disease and/or family history of food allergies. (1) 06/2012 353 2 of 6 Food Allergies Food Allergies vs. Intolerances Food intolerances are classified differently from food allergies based on the pathophysiological mechanism of the reactions. Unlike food allergies, food intolerances do not involve the immune system. Food intolerances are adverse reactions to food caused either by the properties of the food itself, such as a toxin, or the characteristics of the individual, such as a metabolic disorder (4). Food intolerances are often misdiagnosed as food allergies because the symptoms are often similar. Causes of food intolerances may include food poisoning, histamine toxicity, food additives such as monosodium glutamate (MSG), or sulfites (5). The most common food intolerance is lactose intolerance (see nutrition risk criterion #355, Lactose Intolerance ). Common Food Allergens Although reactions can occur from the ingestion of any food, a small number of foods are responsible for the majority of food-induced allergic reactions (6). The foods that most often cause allergic reactions include: cow's milk (and foods made from cow's milk) eggs peanuts tree nuts (walnuts, almonds, cashews, hazelnuts, pecans, brazil nuts) fish crustacean shellfish (e.g., shrimp, crayfish, lobster, and crab) wheat soy For many individuals, food allergies appear within the first two years of life. A llergies to cow's milk, egg s, wheat and soy generally resolve in early childhood. In contrast, allergy to peanuts and tree nuts typically persist to adulthood. Adults may have food allergies continuing from childhood or may develop sensitivity to food allergens encountered after childhood, which usually continue through life. (1) Symptoms There are several types of immune responses to food including IgE-mediated, non-IgE-mediated or mixed. In an IgE-mediated response, the immune system produces allergen-specific IgE antibodies (sIgE) when a food allergen first enters the body. Upon re-exposure to the food allergen, the sIgE identifies it and quickly initiates the release of chemicals, such as histamine (3). These chemicals cause various symptoms based on the area of the body in which they were released. These reactions occur within minutes or up to 4 hours after ingestion and include symptoms such as urticaria (hives), angioedema, wheezing, cough, nausea, vomiting, hypotension and anaphylaxis (7). Food-induced anaphylaxis is the most severe form of IgE-mediated food allergies. It often occurs rapidly, within seconds to a few hours after exposure, and is potentially fatal without proper treatment. Food- induced anaphylaxis often affects multiple organ systems and produces many symptoms, including respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze and bronchospasm), swelling and reduced blood pressur e (7). Prompt diagnosis and treatment is essential to prevent life-threatening reactions. Tree nuts, peanuts, milk, egg, fish and crustacean fish are the leading causes of food-induced anaphylaxis (1). 06/2012 3 of 6 353 Food Allergies Food allergens may also induce allergic reactions which are non-IgE-mediated. N on-IgE-mediated reactions generally occur more than 4 hours after ingestion, primarily result in gastrointestinal symptoms and are more chronic in nature (7). Examples of non-IgE-mediated reactions to specific foods include celiac disease (see nutrition risk criterion #354, Celiac pulmonary hemosiderosis (Heiner's syndrome) (accessed May 2012) (8). The diagnosis of food allergies by a health care provider (HCP) is often difficult and can be multifaceted (see Clarification for more information). Food allergies often coexist with severe asthma, atopic dermatitis (AD), eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and exercise-induced anaphylaxis. Individuals with a diagnosis of any of these conditions should be considered for food allergy evaluation. (1) Prevention Currently, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that restricting highly allergenic foods in the maternal diet during pregnancy or lactation prevents the development of food allergies in the offspring (9). Adequate nutrition intake during pregnancy and lactation is essential to achieve positive health outcomes. Unnecessary food avoidance can result in inadequate nutrition. There is also a lack of evidence that delaying the introduction of solids beyond 6 months of age, including highly allergenic foods, prevents the development of food allergies. If the introduction of developmentally appropriate solid food is delayed beyond 6 months of age, inadequate nutrient intake, growth deficits and feeding problems can occur. (1) The protective role that breastfeeding has in the prevention of food allergies remains unclear. There is some evidence for infants at high risk of developing food allergies that exclusive breastfeeding for at least 4 months may decrease the likelihood of cow 's milk allergy in the first 2 years of life (9). The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) continues to recommend that all infants, including those with a family history of food allergies, be exclusively breastfed until 6 months of age, unless contraindicated for medical reason s (1, 10). For infants who are partially breastfed or formula fed, partially hydrolyzed formulas may be considered as a strategy for preventing the development of food allergies in at-risk infants. According to the AAP , there is no convincing evidence for the use of soy formula as a strategy for preventing the development of food allergies in at-risk infants and therefore it is not recommended. (9) Management Food allergies have been shown to produce anxiety and alter the quality of life of those with the condition. It is recommended that individuals with food allergies and their caregivers be educated on food allergen avoidance and emergency management that is age and culturally appropriate. Individuals with a history of severe food allergic reactions, such as anaphylaxis, should work with their HCP to establish an emergency management plan. (1) Food allergen avoidance is the safest method for managing food allergies. Individuals with food allergies must work closely with their HCP to determine the food(s) to be avoided. This includes the avoidance of any cross-reactive foods, i.e., similar foods within a food group (see Clarification for more information ). Nutrition counseling and growth monitoring is recommended for all individuals with food allergies to ensure a nutritionally adequate diet. Individuals with food allergies should also be educated on reading food labels and ingredient lists. (1) Infants who are partially breastfed or formula fed, with certain non-IgE mediated allergies, such as, FPIES and FPIP may require extensively hydrolyzed casein or amino acid-based formula. According to food allergy 06/2012 353 4 of 6 Food Allergies experts, children with FPIES can be re-challenged every 18-24 months and, infants/children with FPIP can be re-challenged a t 9-12 months of age . The re-challenging of foods should be done with HCP oversight. (8) Implications for WIC Nutrition Services Through client-centered counseling, WIC staff can assist families with food allergies in making changes that improve quality of life and promote nutritional well-being while avoiding offending foods. Based on the needs and interests of the participant, WIC staff can (as appropriate): Facilitate and encourage the participant's ongoing follow -up with the HCP for optimal management of the condition. Promote exclusive breastfeeding until six months of age and continue through the first year (10). Provide hypoallergenic formula for participants with appropriate medical documentation, as needed. Tailor food packages to substitute or remove offending foods. Educate participants on maintaining adequate nutritional intake while avoiding offending foods.

Clarification Self-reporting of a diagnosis by a medical professional should not be confused with self-diagnosis, where a person simply claims to have or to have had a medical condition without any reference to professional diagnosis. A self- reported medical diagnosis (\"My doctor says that I have/my son or daughter has...\") should prompt the CPA to validate the presence of the condition by asking more pointed questions related to that diagnosis. Food allergies are diagnosed by a HCP by evaluating a thorough medical history and conducting a physical exam to consider possible trigger foods to determine the underlying mechanism of the reaction, which guides testing. Along with a detailed history of the disorder, such as symptoms, timing, common triggers and associations, there are several types of tests that the HCP may use in diagnosing food allergies. These include the following: Food Elimination Diet Oral Food Challenges Skin Prick Test (SPT) Allergen-specific serum IgE (sIgE) Atopy Patch Test Diagnosing food allergies is difficult because the detection of sIgE does not necessarily indicate a clinical allergy. Often, more than one type of test is required to confirm a diagnosis. The double-blind, placebo- controlled food challenge is considered the gold standard in testing for food allergies. (11) 06/2012 353 6 of 6 Food Allergies Children often outgrow allergies to cow's milk, soy, egg, and wheat quickly; but are less likely to outgrow allergies to peanut, tree nuts, fish, and crustacean shellfish. If the child has had a recent allergic reaction, there is no reason to retest. Otherwise, annual testing may be considered to see if the allergy to cow's milk, soy, egg, or wheat has been outgrown so the diet can be normalized. (1) Cross-reactive food: When a person has allergies to one food, he/she tends to be allergic to similar foods within a food group. For example, all shellfish are closely related; if a person is allergic to one shellfish, there is a strong chance that person is also allergic to other shellfish. The same holds true for tree-nuts, such as almonds, cashews and walnuts. (1) 06/2012 1 of 5 354 : Celiac Disease 354 Celiac Disease Definition/Cut-off Value Celiac Disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease precipitated by the ingestion of gluten (a protein in wheat, rye, and barley) that results in damage to the small intestine and malabsorption of the nutrients from food. (1). (For more information about the definition of CD, please see the Clarification section) CD is also known as: Celiac Sprue Gluten-sensitive Enteropathy Non-tropical Sprue Presence of condition diagnosed, documented, or reported by a physician or someone working under a physician's orders, or as self reported by applicant/participa nt/caregiver. See Clarification for more information about self-reporting a diagnosis. Participant Category and Priority L evel Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I Non -Breastfeeding Women III, IV, V, or VI Infants I Children III Justification CD affects approximately 1% of the U.S. population (2, 3). CD can occur at any age and the treatment requires strict adherence to a gluten-free diet for life. CD is both a disease of malabsorption and an abnormal immune reaction to gluten. When individuals with CD eat foods or ingest products containing gluten, their immune system responds by damaging or destroying villi \u2014the tiny, fingerlike protrusions lining the small intestine. Villi normally allow nutrients from food to be absorbed through the walls of the small intestine into the bloodstream (4). The destruction of villi can result in malabsorption of nutrients needed for good health. Key nutrients often affected are iron, calcium and folate as they are absorbed in the firs t part of the small intestine. If damage occurs further down the small intestinal tract, malabsorption of carbohydrates (especially lactose), fat and fat-soluble vitamins, protein and other nutrients may also occur (2,5). In addition to the gastrointestinal system, CD affects many other systems in the body, resulting in a wide range and severity of symptoms. Symptoms of CD may include chronic diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, pale foul-smelling fatty stools and weight loss. Failure to thrive may occur in infants and children. The vitamin and mineral deficiencies that can occur from continued exposure to gluten may result in conditions such as anemia, osteoporosis and neurological disorders such as ataxia, seizures and neuropathy. 06/2012 354 2 of 5 Clinical/Health/Medical: Celiac Disease Individuals with CD who continue to ingest gluten are also at increased risk for developing other autoimmune disorders (e.g., thyroid disease, type 1 diabetes, Addison's disease) and certain types of cancer, especially gastrointestinal malignancies (2). Continued exposure to gluten increases the risk of miscarriage or having a low birth weight baby, and may result in infertility in both women and men. A delay in diagnosis for children may cause serious nutritional complications including growth failure, delayed puberty, iron-deficiency anemia, and impaired bone health. Mood swings or depression may also occur (2, 6). See Table 1 for Nutritional Implications and Symptoms. Table 1. Nutritional Implications and Symptoms of CD Common in Children Digestive Symptoms -more common in infants and children, may inclu de: vomiting chronic diarrhea constipation abdominal bloating and pain pale, foul -smelling, or fatty stool Other Symptoms : delayed puberty dental enamel abnormalities of the permanent teeth failure to thrive (delayed growth and short stature) weight loss irritability Common in Adults Digestive Symptoms - same as above, less common in adults Other Symptoms - adults may instead have one or more of the following: unexplained iron -deficie ncy anemia other vitamin and mineral deficiencies (A, D, E, K, calcium) lactose intolerance fatigue bone or joint pain arthritis depression or anxiety tingling numbness in the hands and feet seizures missed menstrual periods infertility (men and women) or recurrent miscarriage canker sores inside the mouth itchy skin rash - dermatititis herpetiformis elevated liver enzymes 06/2012 3 of 5 354 Clinical/Health/Medical : Celiac Disease Table 1.

Accessed Ma y 2012 . The risk for development of CD depends on genetic, immunological, and environmental factors. Recent studies suggest that the introduction of small amounts of gluten while the infant is still breast-fed may reduce the risk of CD. Both breastfeeding during the introduction of dietary gluten, and increasing the duration of breastfeeding were associated with reduced risk in the infant for the development of CD. It is not clear from studies whether breastfeeding delays the onset of symptoms or provides a permanent protection against the disease. Therefore, it is prudent to avoid both early (<4 months) and late (7 months) introduction of gluten and to introduce gluten gradually while the infant is still breast-fed, as thi s may reduce the risk of CD. (7) The only treatment for CD is a gluten-free diet. Individuals with CD should discuss gluten-free food choices with a dietitian or physician that specializes in CD. Individuals with CD should always read food ingredient lists carefully to make sure that the food does not contain gluten. Making informed decisions in the grocery stores and when eating out is essential for the successful treatment of the disease (5, 8). Implications for WIC Nutrition Services Through client-centered counseling, WIC staff can assist participants with CD in making gluten-free food choices that improve quality of life and promote nutritional well-being. WIC can provide nutrition education/counseling on alternatives to gluten-containing food products as well as provide gluten-free grain selections available in the WIC food packages. Based on the needs and interests of the participant, WIC staff may (as appropriate): Promote breastfeeding throughout the first year of life, with exclusive breastfeeding until 4- 6 months of age. In consultation with the guidance of a medical provider, introduce gluten-containing foods between 4 and 6 months to infants at risk of CD, including infants with a parent or sibling with CD . Tailor food packages to substitute or remove gluten-containing foods. Educate participants on meeting nutritional needs in the absence of gluten-containing foods. Encourage high fiber, gluten-free grain selections. Monitor participant's growth pattern and weight status . Educate participants on planning gluten-free meals and snacks for outside the home.

According to the 2010 NIAID-Sponsored Expert Panel definition, CD is a non-IgE mediated food allergy (10). (See nutrition risk criterion #353, Food Allergy .) However, the Expert Panel did not include information about CD in its report but rather refers readers to existing clinical guidelines on CD, including the AGA Institute's Technical Review. (5 9,10) 06/ 2012 1 of 3 355 Clinical/Health/Medical: Lactose Intolerance 355 Lactose Intolerance Definition/Cut-off Value Lactose intolerance is the syndrome of one or more of the following: diarrhea, abdominal pain, flatulence, and/or bloating, that occurs after lactose ingestion. Presence of condition diagnosed, documented, or reported by a physician or someone working under a physician's orders, or as self reported by applicant/participant/caregiver. See Clarification for more information about self-reporting a diagnosis. Participant Category and Priority L evel Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I Non -Breastfeeding Women III, IV, V, or VI Infants I Children III Justification Lactose intolerance occurs because of a deficiency in the levels of the lactase enzyme (1). Many variables determine whether a person with lactase deficiency develops symptoms. They include: the dose of lactose ingested; the residual intestinal lactase activity; the ingestion of food along with lactose; the ability of the colonic flora to ferment lactose; and, the individual sensitivity to the products of lactose fermentation (1). Some forms of lactase deficiencies may be temporary, resulting from premature birth or small bowel injuries, and will correct themselves, leaving individuals with the ability to digest lactose sufficiently (2). Primary lactase deficiency is attributable to relative or absolute absence of lactase that develops in childhood, and is the most common cause of lactose malabsorption and lactose intolerance (2). Secondary lactase deficiency is one that results from small bowel injury, such as acute gastroenteritis, persistent diarrhea, or other causes that injure the small intestine mucosa, and can present at any age, but is more common in infancy. Treatment of secondary lactase deficiency and lactose malabsorption attributable to an underlying condition generally do not require elimination of lactose from the diet. Once the primary problem is resolved, lactose-containing products can be consumed normally. (2) Congenital lactase deficiency is a rare disorder that has been reported in only a few infants. Affected newborn infants present with intractable diarrhea as soon as human milk or lactose-containing formula is introduced. (2) Developmental lactase deficiency is the relative lactase deficiency observed among pre-term infants of less than 34 weeks gestation (2). One study in preterm infants reported benefit from the use of lactase- supplemented feedings or lactose-reduced formulas (3). The use of lactose-containing formulas and human milk does not seem to have any short- or long-term deleterious effects in preterm infants (2). 06/2012 355 2 of 3 Clinical/Health/Medical: Lactose Intolerance Lactose is found primarily in milk, milk-based formula and other dairy products, which provide a variety of nutrients essential to the WIC population (calcium, vitamin D, protein). Lactose intolerance varies according to individuals. Some individuals may tolerate various quantities of lactose without discomfort, or tolerate it when consumed with other foods. Dairy products that are soured, or otherwise treated with bacteria that secrete lactase (e.g., Lactobacillus acidophilus), such as cheese and yogurt, are easier to digest in lactose-intolerant individuals because they contain relatively low levels of lactose. (4 ) Many individuals diagnosed with lactose intolerance avoid dairy all together. Also, lactose intolerance has been shown to be associated with low bone mass and increased risk of fracture (5). Inadequate dairy intake increases the risk of metabolic syndrome, hypertension, preeclampsia, obesity and certain forms of cancer, especially colon cancer (6). Implications for WIC Nutrition Services It is important to assess participants individually for lactose tolerances and nutrient needs to determine the best plan of action. WIC can provide client-centered counseling to incorporate tolerated amounts of lactose-containing foods and/or other dietary sources of calcium, vitamin D and protein into participant s' diets. WIC foods such as cheese, lactose-free milk, soy beverages, tofu, and calcium fortified foods (like juice) can provide these nutrients to participants with lactose intolerance. Based on the needs and interests of the participant, WIC staff can, in addition, also offer the following strategies (as appropriate): Except for infants with congenital lactase deficiency , promote exclusive breastfeeding until six months of age and continue breastfeeding through the first year . For infants with congenital lactase deficiency, treatment is removal and substitution of lactose from the diet with a commercial lactose-free formula (2). Tailor food packages to substitute or remove lactose-containing foods. Educate participants on meeting nutritional needs in the absence of lactose-containing foods. Educate participants on planning lactose-free/lactose-reduced meals and snacks for outings, social gatherings, school and/or work. Any WIC participant suspected to have lactose intolerance should be referred to a health care provider for evaluation and appropriate diagnosis (7), if needed (see Clarification for additional information on diagnosing Lactose Intolerance).

A self- reported medical diagnosis (\"My doctor says that I have/my son or daughter has...\") should prompt the CPA to validate the presence of the condition by asking more pointed questions related to that diagnosis. Lactose malabsorption can be diagnosed with a hydrogen breath test. The test involves having individuals ingest a standard dose of lactose after fasting. Elevated levels of breath hydrogen, which are produced by bacterial fermentation of undigested lactose in the colon, indicate the presence of lactose malabsorption (1). The hydrogen breath test is not routinely ordered, and instead, patients are frequently asked to assess symptoms while avoiding dairy products for a period of time followed by a lactose product challenge to determine if they are lactose intolerant (7). The demonstration of lactose malabsorption does not necessarily indicate that an individual will be symptomatic. 04/2001 1 of 2 356 Clinical/Health/Medical: Hypoglycemia 356 Hypoglycemia Definition/Cut-off Value Presence of hypoglycemia diagnosed, documented, or reported by a physician or someone working under a physician's orders, or as self reported by applicant/participant/caregiver.

Symptomatic hypoglycemia is a risk observed in a substantial proportion of newborns who are small for gestational age (SGA), but it is uncommon and of shorter duration in newborns who are of the appropriate size for gestational age (2). WIC can provide nutrition management that concentrates on frequent feedings to support adequate growth for infants and children (2). WIC can also provide nutrition education to help manage hypoglycemia in women that includes consuming a balanced diet, low carbohydrate snacks and exercise (1). References 1.

See Clarification for more information about self-reporting a diagnosis. Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I Non -Breastfeeding Women III, IV, V or VI Justification Anorexia nervosa and bulimia are serious eating disorders that affect women in the childbearing years. These disorders result in general malnutrition and may cause life-threatening fluid and electrolyte imbalances. Women with eating disorders may begin pregnancy in a poor nutritional state. They are at risk of developing chemical and nutritional imbalances, deficiencies, or weight gain abnormalities during pregnancy if aberrant eating behaviors are not controlled. These eating disorders can seriously complicate any pregnancy since the nutritional status of the pregnant woman is an important factor in perinatal outcome. Maternal undernutrition is associated with increased perinatal mortality and an increased risk of congenital malformation. While the majority of pregnant women studied reported a significant reduction in their eating disorder symptoms during pregnancy, a high percentage of these women regressed in the postpartum period. This regression in postpartum women is a serious concern for breastfeeding and non- breastfeeding postpartum women who are extremely preoccupied with rapid weight loss after delivery. References 1.

Any occurrence: Within the past two ( 2) months may be self- reported. More than two (>2) months previous must have the continued need for nutritional support diagnosed by a physician or a health care provider working under the orders of a physici an. Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I Non -Breastfeeding Women III, IV, V or VI Infants I Children III Justification The body's response to injuries such as major surgeries , physical trauma , or burn may adversely affect nutrient requirements needed for recovery , lead ing to malnutrition. The catabolic response to these injuries cause s a hypermetabolic state in the body. This alteration in metabolism not only increase s the individual's calorie and protein needs, but they also increase the needs for certain vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, and amino acids . (1) Proper wound healing is essential in the recovery of surgeries, physical trauma, and burns. Normal wound healing is a complex pr ocess and involves three phases : inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling ( 1, 2). Each phase of wound healing involves growth factors, other biologically active molecules, and specific vitamins and minerals such as Vita min A, Vitamin C, and Zinc. The process of wound healing does not always follow the three stages sequentially and can sometimes move forward or regress based on nutrition status and response to treatment ( 3, 4). Even after a wound is closed, the individual's metabolic rate and need for additional nutrition can remain high ( 5). Factors that can prevent proper wound healing or can increase the time needed for a wound to heal include (2, 6): Malnutrition prior to the surgery, injury or burn Infections Diabetes 06/2016 359 2 of 6 Clinical/Health/Medical: Recent Major Surgery, Trauma, Burns Poor blood flow Obesity Age Heavy alcohol use Stress Medications Smoking Because healing is a complex process and is impacted by a variety of factors, it is inappropriate to expect a set recovery time for an individual based solely on the type and severity of the injury ( 7). For some individuals, they may no longer be at increased nutritional risk within a couple weeks of thei r injury. For others , recovery from the same type and s everity of injury may take months. Major Surgery and Wound Healing Many types of surgeries are completed a s noninvasive procedures and do not result in large incisions that require additional medical and nutritional care to heal. However, many s urgical procedures (including cesarean sections ) do involve incisions that , if left unaddressed, could lead to infec tion. Major surgeries are surgeries that involve a risk to the life of the individual and include operations on organs within the body (8). Removal of a portion of the large or small intestine, heart surgery, and bariatric surgery are examples of major surgeries. Minor surgeries are surgeries that involve little risk to the individual and include operations on the superficial structures of the body ( 9). Ear tubes, the most common childhood surgery performed with anesthesia, are an ex ample of a minor surgery that does not impact nutrition status ( 10). Cesarean sections are considered a major surgery and , therefore, require additional assessment and education in the WIC clinic. In the US, t he rate of cesarean delivery rose from 19.7% of singleton births in 1996 to 31.3% of singleton births in 2011 ( 11). Reasons for a cesarean delivery include: multiple pregnancy, labor fails to progress, medical concerns for the infant, problems with the placenta, a large infant, breech position, maternal infections, and medical conditions in the mother (i.e. diabetes or high blood pressure) (12). Nutritional C onsiderations for Major S urgery /Wound Healing The role of specific nutrients in wound healing continues to be explored and studies are conducte d regularly to assess the role vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, amino acids, and carbohydrates play in proper wound healing. N utrient supplements above the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) may be nec essary to aid in wound healing. However, b efore using any additional supplement to assist in wound healing, energy and protein requirements of the individual must be met ( 13, 14). Amino acid s are essential to the repair of damaged tissue in the body. Amino acids are divided into three categories: e ssential (mu st be obtained through foods), nonessential (can be produced in the body), and c onditionally essential (produced in the body except in cases of injury or illness). Arginine and Glutamine are examples of conditionally essential amino acids. Th e following table highlights the roles of these nutrien ts in the wound healing process: 06/2016 3 o f 6 359 Clinical/Health/Medical: Recent Major Surgery, Trauma, Burns Nutrient Role in Wound Healing Arginine Involved in secretion of growth hormone ( 12) Omega -3 fatty acids Reduces wound infections ( 12) Vitamin C Collagen synthesis ( 2) Vitamin A Immune function and cellular communication ( 15) Vitamin E Antioxidant ( 16) Vitamin D Modulates cell growth Neuromuscular and immune function Reduces inflammation ( 17) Magnesium Co-factor for enzymes involved in protein and collagen synthesis ( 2) Copper Co-factor for cross -linking of collagen ( 2) Zinc Involved in RNA and DNA polymerase ( 2) Iron Aids in the synthesis of some growth hormones and connective tissue ( 18) Following a cesarean section, a breastfeeding mother may experience difficulty finding a comfortable nursing position that does not cause pain with the incision. She may also have difficulty breastfeeding if the infant is drowsy due to the pain medication administered during the procedure. A refer ral to a l actation specialist can help ensure that the mother is successful in reaching her breastfeeding goals. Physical Trauma Physical trauma is usually a result of accidents and injuries that often lead to fractures, wounds, and subsequent hospitalization. Physical trauma can be divided into blunt force trauma, penetrating trauma, and trauma from surgery. Blunt force trauma is the result of an object (or force) striking the body, causing concussions, lacerations or fractures. Penetrating trauma is trauma that occurs as a result of an object piercing the skin, causing an open wound ( 7). Fracture healing is a process that begins with a hemorrhage and progresses through three stages: inflammatory, reparative, and remodeling. Physical trauma can also be a resu lt of domestic and/or child abuse. In addition to the physical effects of abuse, victims of abuse often experience acute and ongoing psychological and emotional trauma that may also impact an individual's nutrition status. Poor appetite, undesirable food choices, and using food for coping can impact both women and children. Children may also begin hoarding food in cases of abuse or neglect. For more information on the impact of abuse, see Risk #901 Recipient of Abuse. Nutrition al Considerations for Phys ical T rauma In addition to an increase in energy, protein, and micronutrients needed for proper wound healing, physical trauma that includes fractures require s additional nutrients for proper bone healing. In some cases, the physical trauma will lead to t emporary or lifelong difficulty with self -feeding. Research on the roles specific nutrients play in fracture healing continues to expand. Key nutrients for bone health include calcium, phosphorus, fluoride, magnesium, sodium, vitamin D, vitamin A, vitami n K, vitamin C, vitamin B6, folat e, and vitamin B12. Meeting RDAs set for these nutrients is important for bone health and bone healing ( 19). 06/2016 359 4 of 6 Clinical/Health/Medical: Recent Major Surgery, Trauma, Burns For some in dividuals, intakes above the RDA may be recommended by their medical provider to assist in bone heali ng; however, some nutrients including fluoride, sodium, and vitamin A may negatively impact bone health when intake is above the recommended level ( 19). Burns Burns can be caused by heat (including hot surfaces, fires, and hot liquids), chemicals, electric ity, sunlight or nuclear radiation. There are three stages of burns based on what layers of the skin are bur ned. A first - degree burn only a ffects the outer layer of the skin (epidermis). A second -degree burn damages the epidermis and the layer directly under the epidermis (dermis). A third- degree burn damages the epidermis, dermis, and damage s the tissue underneath the skin. (20) Burns are also classified based on the surface area of the body that has been burned (Percent Total Body Surface Area or TB SA). For example, a burn that covers one hand and arm would be 9 % TBSA , whereas a burn that covers a person' s back would be 18% TBSA (21 ). Increases in the surface area affected by the burn result in a greater potential for fluid loss and infection (21). Inhalation burns are burns that occur inside an individual's lungs and internal organs. Once discharged from the hospital, enteral feedings may be prescribed to aid in healing. Nutritional Considerations for B urns The nutrition status of burn patients is monitored very closely during hospitalization and after discharge . Following a severe burn, the body goes into a catabolic state and the body begins to breakdown skeletal muscle ( 5). This state increases the requirements for energy, protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants ( 22). Damaged blood vessels also increase fluid loss and can lead to dehydration or shock ( 19). Nutrition care in the hospital setting for individual's recovering from burns may also include parenteral or enteral nutrition support depending on the severity of the burns. Glutamine, a conditionally essential amino acid, can improve the healing of burns ( 23). Implications for WIC Nutrition Services Most surgeries, physical traumas , and burns are unexpected. The education and supplemental food that WIC provides can help ensure that the individual is in good nutritional health prior to the surgery, physical trauma or burn. Following a major surgery, physical trauma, and/or burn, an individual will be at incre ased nutritional risk until the injury has completely healed. WIC staff can improve outcomes following an injury by: Assuring that vitamin and mineral intakes meet the RDAs (unless amounts that exceed the RDAs are recommended by their medical provider ). Assuring that energy and protein intake preserve lean muscle mass and body weight. Recommending a participant speak with their medical provider about a multivitamin supplement when diet alone cannot meet the RDAs for vitamins and minerals. Referring to community resources for smoking cessation, support groups, food assistance, and safe living environments (in cases of physical abuse). Referring to a lactation educator if women experience difficulty breastfeeding following a cesarean section. 06/2016 5 o f 6 359 Clinical/Health/Medical: Recent Major Surgery, Trauma, Burns References 1.

The current condition, or treatment for the condition, must be severe enough to affect nutritional status. This includes, but is not limited to: Medical Condition Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JRA) Heart Disease Lupus Erythematosus Cystic Fibrosis Cardio Respiratory Diseases Persistent Asthma (moderate or severe) requiring daily medication Presence of medical condition(s) diagnosed, documented, or reported by a physician or someone working under a physician's orders, or as self reported by applicant/participant/caregiver. See Clarification fo r more information about self-reporting a diagnosis. Participant Category and Priority L evel Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I Non -Breastfeeding Women III, IV, V or VI Infants I Children III Justification Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) is the most common pediatric rheumatic disease and most common cause of chronic arthritis among children. JRA puts individuals at risk of anorexia, weight loss, failure to grow, and protein energy malnutrition. Lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disorder that affects multiple organ systems. Lupus erythematosus increases the risk of infections, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss. In pregnant women, there is increased risk of spontaneous abortion and late pregnancy losses (after 28 weeks gestation). Cardiorespiratory diseases affect normal physiological processes and can be accompanied by failure to thrive and malnutrition. Cardiorespiratory diseases put individuals at risk for growth failure and malnutrition due to low calorie intake and hypermetabolism. 04/2001 360 2 of 3 Clinical/Health/Medical: Other Medical Conditions Cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disorder of children, adolescents, and young adults characterized by widespread dysfunction of the exocrine glands, is the most common lethal hereditary disease of the Caucasian race Many aspects of the disease of CF stress the nutritional status of the patient directly or indirectly by affecting the patient's appetite and subsequent intake. Gastrointestinal losses occur in spite of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. Also, catch-up growth requires additional calories. All of these factors contribute to a chronic energy deficit, which can lead to a marasmic type of malnutrition. The primary goal of nutritional therapy is to overcome this energy deficit. Studies have shown variable intakes in the CF population, but the intakes are usually less than adequate and are associated with a less than normal growth pattern. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways, which can cause recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing of variable severity. Persistent asthma requires daily use of medication, preferably inhaled anti-inflammatory agents. Severe forms of asthma may require long-term use of oral corticosteroids which can result in growth suppression in children, poor bone mineralization, high weight gain, and, in pregnancy, decreased birthweight of the infant. High doses of inhaled corticosteroids can result in growth suppression in children and poor bone mineralization. Untreated asthma is also associated with poor growth and bone mineralization and, in pregnant women, adverse birth outcomes such as low birth weight, prematurity, and cerebral palsy. Repeated asthma exacerbations (\"attacks\") can, in the short-term, interfere with eating, and in the long-term, cause irreversible lung damage that contributes to chronic pulmonary disease. Compliance with prescribed medications is considered to be poor. Elimination of environmental factors that can trigger asthma exacerbations (such as cockroach allergen or environmental tobacco smoke) is a major component of asthma treatment. WIC can help by providing foods high in calcium and vitamin D, in educating participants to consume appropriate foods and to reduce environmental triggers, and in supporting and encouraging compliance with the therapeutic regimen prescribed by the health care provider. Note: This criterion will usually not be applicable to infants for the medical condition of asthma. In infants, asthma-like symptoms are usually diagnosed as bronchiolitis with wheezing which is covered under Criterion #352, Infectious Diseases. References 1.

See the Clarification section for more information about self -reporting a diagnosis. Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I Non -Breastfeeding Women III, IV, V, or VI J ustification According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), nearly 10 percent of the U.S. population age s 18 and older suffers from depression each year, with 6.7 percent suffering from major depressive disorder s (1). Although depression can occur at any age, the average onset is around age 30 (1, 2). Depression occurs twice as frequently in women as in men. Depression has a variety of symptoms, but the most common are deep feeling s of sadness or a marked loss of interest in pleasure or activities. Other symptoms of depression include: appetite changes resulting in unintended weight losses or gains, insomnia or oversleeping, loss of energy or increased fatigue, restlessness or irritability, feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt and difficulty thinking, concentrating or making decision s (1-3). Further , depression can increase the risk for some chronic diseases such as coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, chronic pain syndromes, premature aging, and impaired wound healing . Therefore, untreated depression has the potential to impact long term health status (4). For information about children and depression, please see the Clarification section. Pregnancy and Depression Depression is common during pregnancy. B etween 14 and 23 percent of pregnant women will experience depressive symptoms ( 5, 6). Several studies have found that depression risk is highest during the last trimester of pregnancy (4). Women who experience depression during pregnancy are found to be less likely to seek prenatal care (3). They may also suffer from episodes of nausea/vomiting or initiate/ increase the use of drugs, alcohol and nicotine (4). Pregnant women with depression may be at risk for preeclampsia , preterm delivery or delivery of low birth weight infants and have higher perinatal mortality rates (5, 6). Pregnant Adolescents In the United States, 10 percent of women become pregnant during adolescence (7). The prevalence of teen pregnancy is highest among African and Native Americans, lower socioeconomic groups, and those living in stressful family environments. The prevalence rate of depression among pregnant adolescents is between 16 and 44 percent , which is almost twice as high as among their adult counterparts and non- pregnant adolescents (7). 11/2013 361 2 of 6 Clinical/Health/Medical: Depression Adolescence is a stage of rapid metabolic, hormonal, physiological and developmental changes. Depressive symptoms are likely to emerge when the physiologic and psychological changes that occur during pregnancy are superimposed upon normal developmental change . (8) Teens who are under stress, lack social and/or family support, experience significant loss, or who have attention, learning or conduct disorders are at greater risk for developing clinical depression (9). Depression in young people often occurs with mental disorders, substance abuse disorders, or physical illnesses, such as diabetes (10). Pregnant adolescents with depressive symptoms are more likely to delay or refuse prenatal care and have subsequent , short interval pregnancies (within 24 months) , both of which have shown to result in poor pregnancy outcomes (11, 12). Antidepressant Use in Pregnancy Negative consequences for t he newborn such as fetal growth changes and shorter gestation periods have been associated with both depression symptoms and use of antidepressant medications during pregnancy. Although rare, some studies have linked fetal malformations, cardiac defects, pulmonary hypertension and reduced birth weight to antidepressant use during pregnancy, however, more research in this area is needed . (4, 6 , 13) For more information about specific drug therapies used for treating depression, please see the Clarification section (14). A fetus exposed to antidepressants throughout pregnancy or during the last trimester may, in rare instances, experience temporary withdrawal symptoms \u2014 such as jitters or irritability \u2014 at birth (15, 16). Some health care providers may suggest tapering dosages until after birth to minimize newborn withdrawal symptoms though it is unclear whether this method can reduce harmful effects. This strategy may also be unsafe for new mothers as they enter the postpartum period \u2014 a time of increased risk of mood swings and problems with anxiety . Therefore, it is imperative that prenatal women discuss the risks and benefits of antidepressant therapy with their health care provider. Postpartum Depression and Related Mood Disorders Postpartum de pression was historically hypothesized to be caused by low estrogen and progesterone levels immediately following birth , however, t his hypothesis has been found to have limited scientific support (17). Emerging studie s have found that reproductive hormones have an indirect relationship on depression because of the influence on stress hormones, immune markers or sleep quality. The incidence of postpartum depression in new mothers can range from approximately 12 to 25 p ercent, to up to 35 percent or more in some high -risk groups . High risk groups include: women of low income, younger age, low education level and histories of stressful life ev ents or traumatic experiences. Some studies have higher percentage rates for depression because they include both subjects with diagnosed major depression and those with depressive symptoms, thus accounting for the wide range in rates. (4) Postpartum depression is distinguished from \"baby blues\" - a common reaction following deliv ery - both by its duration and the debilitating effects of the indifference the mother has about herself and her children (17). \"Baby blues \" are characterized by mild depressive symptoms, tearfulness (often for no discernibl e reason), anxiety, irritablene ss, mood fluctuations , increased sensitivity and fatigue. The \"blues\" typically peak four to five days after delivery, may last hours to days and resolve by the 10th postnatal day (18 ). Inflammation and Depression In flammation was once recognized as one of several risk factors for depression . New research has found that inflammation is not a risk factor \u2014but rather it is the risk factor that underlies all others. This represents a shift in how inflammation contributes to depression. Emerging research ha s revealed that depression is associated with 11/2013 3 of 6 361 Clinical/Health/Medica l: Depression inflammation manifested by increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Common experiences of new motherhood ; sleep disturbance, postpartum pain and past or current psychological trauma, act as stressors tha t cause proinflammatory cytokine levels to rise. This finding may explain why psychosocial, behavioral and physical risk factors increase the risk of depression (19). Additionally, inflammation levels normally rise during the last trimester of pregnancy , which may explain, as stated in the Pregnancy and Depression section above , the higher risk for expe riencing depression during pregnancy (4 ). Breastfeeding and Depression Successful breastfeeding has a prot ective effect on maternal mental health because it attenuates stress and modulates the inflammatory response. Conversely, breastfeeding difficulties such as nipple pain can increase the risk of depression and should be addressed promptly. (19) Implicatio ns for WIC Nutrition Services Individuals diagnosed with depression can benefit from WIC nutrition services and supplemental foods. Through participant -centered counseling , WIC staff can , as necessary: Reinforce and support the treatments and therapies prescribed by the participant's health care provider. Make referrals to the primary health care provider and/ or to other appropriate mental health and social service programs. A 2010 brief from the Urban Institute , recognized the WIC Program as a viable access point to identify and refer mothers with depressive symptoms ( 20).

Clarification Self-reporting of a diagnosis by a medical professional should not be confused with self -diagnosis, where a person simply claims to have or to have had a medical condition without any reference to professional diagnosis. A self - reported medical diagnosis (\"My doctor says that I have/my son or daughter has...\") should prompt the CPA to validate the presence of the condition by asking more pointed questions related to that diagnosis. Depression may be present in young children; however, it is generally not diagnosed until later in life. At this time, there is no evidenced -based research to suppor t the diagnosis of depression as a risk criterion for WIC children participants. It is important to not e, however , that a child's health may be at risk if the mother has a diagnosis of depression. Nutrition Risk Criterion #902; Woman or Infant/Child of Primary Caregiver with Limited ability to Make Feeding Decisions or Prepare Food, is an appropriate risk criterion assignment for an infant or child of a WIC mother diagnosed with clinical depression . There are three major classes of antidepressants . Of the three classes listed below, the first two, Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are generally viewed as safe options for pregnant and breastfeeding women. MAOIs such as always contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding as reproductive safety has not been established. (20) Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are the oldest, least expensive and most studied of the antidepressants with a proven track record of effectiveness and include medications such as Amitriptyline (Elavil) and Desipramine (Norpramin). Noted drawbacks are complex dosing, unpleasant side effects and risk of suicide. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are used most frequently in pregnant and breastfeeding mothers. Sertraline (Zoloft) and paroxetine (Paxil) are recommended first line treatments for breastfeeding women due to fewer side effects than other antidepressants and a once -a-day dosing schedule. Paroxetine (Paxil) is generally discouraged during pregnancy because it has been associate d with fetal heart defects when taken during the first three months of pregnancy. Infants of mothers on these medications should be monitored for the following symptoms: sedation, a gitation, irritability, poor feeding and of 6 Clinical/Health/Medical: Depression Monoamine work by inhibiting the monoamine oxidase to allow for more norepinephrine and serotonin to remain available in the brain. As stated above, these types o f medications are always contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding as reproductive safety has not been established. Furthermore, MAOIs have many drug and diet contraindications. Nutrition Risk Criterion #357 Drug -Nutrient Interactions may be assigned, as appropriate, to women taking anitdepressants . 04/2001 1 of 2 362 Clinical/Health/Medical: Development, Sensory or Motor Disabilities Interfering with the Ability to Eat 362 Developmental, Sensory or Motor Disabilities Interfering with the Ability to Eat Definition/Cut-off Value Developmental, sensory or motor disabilities that restrict the ability to intake chew or swallow food or require tube feeding to meet nutritional needs. Disabilities include but are not limited to: Disability Minimal brain function Head trauma Feeding problems due to a developmental disability such as pervasive development disorder (PDD) which includes autism Brain damage Birth injury Other disabilities Participant Category and Priority L evel Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I Non -Breastfeeding Women III, IV, V or VI Infants I Children III Justification Infants and children with developmental disabilities are at increased risk for nutritional problems. Education, referrals, and service coordination with WIC will aid in early intervention of these disabilities. Prenatal, lactating and non-lactating women with developmental, sensory or motor disabilities may: 1) have feeding problems associated with muscle coordination involving chewing or swallowing, thus restricting or limiting the ability to consume food and increasing the potential for malnutrition; or 2) require enteral feedings to supply complete nutritional needs which may potentially increase the risk for specific nutrient deficiencies. Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) is a category of developmental disorders with autism being the most severe. Young children may initially have a diagnosis of PDD with a more specific diagnosis of autism usually occurring at 2 1/2 to 3 years of age or older. Children with PDD have very selective eating habits that go beyond the usual \"picky eating\" behavior and that may become increasingly selective over time, i.e., foods they used to eat will be refused. This picky behavior can be related to the color, shape, texture or temperature of a food. Common feeding concerns include: 04/2001 362 2 of 2 Clinical/Health/Medical: Development, Sensory or Motor Disabilities Interfering with the Ability to Eat Difficulty with transition to textures, especially during infancy; Increased sensory sensitivity; restricted intake due to color, texture, and/or temperature of foods; Decreased selection of foods over time; Difficulty accepting new foods; difficulty with administration of multivitamin/mineral supplementation and difficulty with changes in mealtime environment. Nutrition education, referrals, and service coordination with WIC will assist the participant, parent or caregiver in making dietary changes/adaptations and finding assistance to assure she or her infant or child is consuming a nutritionally adequate diet.

Zeman, Frances Definition/Cut off Value Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) are referred to as prediabetes. These conditions are characterized by hyperglycemia that does not meet the diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus (1). See Clarification for more information. Presence of condition diagnosed, documented, or reported by a physician or someone working under a physician's orders, or as self re ported by applicant/participant/caregiver. See Clarification for more information about selfreporting a diagnosis. Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Breastfeeding Women I NonBreastfeeding Women III, IV, V or VI Justification An individual who is identified as having prediabetes is at relatively high risk for the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Clarification of Diabetes Mellitus (2, 3) recognized a group of individuals whose glucose levels, although not meeting criteria for diabetes, are neverth eless too high to be considered normal. The blood tests used to measure plasma glucose and to diagnose prediabetes include a fasting plasma glucose test and a glucose tolerance test (see Clarification for more information). Individuals with a fasting plasma glucose level between 100125 mg/dl are referred to as having impaired fasting glucose (IFG ). Individuals with plasma glucose levels of 140199 mg/dl after a 2hour oral glucose tolerance test are referred to as having impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Many individuals with IGT are euglycemic and, along with those with IFG, may have normal or near normal glycosylate d hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. Often times, individuals with IGT manifest hyperglycemia only when challenged with the oral glucose load used in standardized oral glucose tolerance test. The prevalence of IFG and IGT increases greatly between the ages of 2049 years. In people who are > 45 years of age and overweight (BMI 25), the prevalence of IFG is 9.3%, and for IGT, it is 12.8% (4). Screening for prediabetes is critically important in the prevention of type 2 diabetes. The American Diabetes Association recommends (5) that testing to detect prediabetes should be considered in all asymptomatic adults who are overweight (BMI 25) or obese (BMI 30) and who have one or more additional risk factors (see Table 1 in Clarification). IFG and IGT are not clinical entities in their own right but, rather, risk factors for future diabetes as well as CVD. (Note: During pregnancy, IFG and IGT are diagnosed as gestation a l diabetes.) They can be observed as intermediate stages in many of the disease processes. IFG and IGT are associated with the metabolic syndrome, which includes obesity (especially abdominal or visceral obesity), dyslipidemia (the high triglyceride and/or low HDL type), and hypertension. Dietary recommendations include monitoring of calories, reduced carbohydrate intake and high fiber consu mption. Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) aimed 07/2009 363 2 of 3 Clinical/Health/Medical: PreDiabetes at producing 510% loss of body weight and increased exercise have been variably demonstrated to prevent or delay the development of diabetes in people with IGT. However, the potential impact of such interventions to reduce cardiovascular risk has not been examined to date (2, 3). WIC nutrition services can support and reinforce the MNT and physical a ctivity recommendations that participants receive from their health care providers. In addition, WIC nutritionists can play an important role in providing women with counseling to help them achieve or maintain a healthy weight after delivery. The WIC food package provides high fiber, low fat foods emphasizing consumption of whole grains , fruits, vegetables and dairy products. This will further assist WIC families in reducing their risk for diabetes. References 1.American Diabetes Association. Clinical practice recommendations: standards of medical care in diabetes.

Clarification Selfreporting of a diagnosis by a medical professional should not be confused with selfdiagnosis, where a person simply claims to have or to have had a medical condition without any reference to professional diagnosis. A selfreported medical diagnosis (\"My doctor says that I have/my son or daughter has...\") should prompt the CPA to vali date the presence of the condition by asking more pointed questions related to that diagnosis. Hyperglycemia is identified through a fasting blood glucose or an oral glucose tolerance test (1). Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) is defined as fasting plasma glucose (FPG) > 100 or >125 mg/dl (> 5.6 or 6.1 mmol/l), depending on study and guidelines (2). Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is defined as a 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with 2h plasma glucose values of 140199 mg/dl 07 /2009 3 of 3 363 Clinical/Health/Medical: PreDiabetesThe cumulative incidence of diabetes over 56 years was low (45%) in those individuals with normal fasting and normal 2h OGTT values, intermediate (2034%) in those with IFG and normal 2h OGTT or IGT and a normal FPG, and highest (3865%) in those with combined IFG and IGT (4). Recommendations for testing for prediabet es and diabetes in asymptomatic, undiagnosed adults are listed in Table 1 below. Table 1. Criteria and Methods for Testing for PreDiabetes and Diabetes in Asymptomatic Adults 1.Testing should be considered in all adults who are overweight (BMI > 25*) and have addit i onal risk factors: Physical inactivity Firstdegree relative with diabetes Members of a highrisk ethnic population (e.g., African American, Latino, Native American, Asian American, Pacific Islander) Women who delivered a baby weighing > 9 lb or were diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus Hyperte nsion (blood pressure > 14 0/90 mmHg or on therapy for hypertension) HDL cholesterol level < 35 mg/dl and/or a triglyceride level > 250 mg/dl Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) IGT or IFG on previous testing Other clinical conditions associated with insulin resistance (e.g., severe obesity and acanthosis nigrican s) History of CVD 2.In the absence of the above criteria, testing for prediabetes and diabetes should begin at age 45 years. 3.If results are normal, testing should be repeated at least at 3year intervals, with consideration of more frequent testing depending on initial results and risk status. 4.To test for prediabetes or diabetes, eit her an FPG test or 2hour oral glucose tolerance (OGTT; 75 g glucose load), or both, is appropriate. 5.An OGTT may be considered in patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) to better define the risk of diabetes. 6.In those identified with prediabetes, identify and if appropriate, treat other CVD risk factors. *Atrisk BM I may be lower in some ethnic groups. 12/2020 1 of 11 371 Clinical/Health/Medical: Nicotine and Tobacco Use 371 Nicotine and Tobacco Use Definition /Cut -off Value Any use of products that contain nicotine and/or tobacco to include but not limited to cigarettes, pipes, cigars, electronic nicotine delivery systems (e -cigarettes, vaping devices), hookahs, smokeless tobacco (chewing tobacco, snuff, dissolvables), or nicotine replacement therapies (gum s, patch es). Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I Postpartum Women III, IV, V, VI, VII Justification Tobacco products, made with the dried leaves of the tobacco plant, contain a variety of harmful chemicals. The use of tobacco can lead to serious illness es, including cancers, lung disease, and heart disease. Nicotine, one of the chemicals in tobacco, is highly addictive and associat ed with additional health risks (1). During pregnancy, the use of nicotine and/or tobacco products is harmful to both the mother and fetus, with potential consequences including low birth weight or even miscarriage (2). Nicotine can be found in breastmilk, therefore, the use of nicotine products may directly impact breastfed infants ( 3). Women, infants , and children living in a smoking environment also face adverse health outcom es that are outlined in risk #904 Environmental Tobacco Smoke Exposure. Tobacco Smoking Tobacco smok e is a toxic mix of more than 7,000 chemicals that cause immediate damage to the body . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), smoking remains the single largest preventable cause of death and disease in the United States. Ciga rette smoking kills more than 480,000 Americans each year . (2) According to 2018 CDC data, 14.1% of adult women in the US use tobacco products (4). In 2016, one in fourteen women who gave birth smoked cigarettes during pregnancy. The women most likely to smoke during pregnancy were aged 20 -24, identified as non -Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native, and whose highest level of educational attainment was high school or less (5). Additionally, CDC data from 2014 indicated that women who received WIC b enefits were more likely to smoke before and during pregnancy than women who did not receive WIC benefits (6). There are no CDC data that report on the incidence of smoking among breastfeeding women. Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) Vapes, vap orizers, vape pens, hookah pens, electronic cigarettes (e -cigarettes or e -cigs), and e -pipes are some of the many terms used to describe electronic nico tine delivery systems (ENDS) ( 7). ENDS are noncombustible tobacco products used to smoke or \"vape\" a so lution that often contains nicotine. The solution, or \"e -liquid\", is heated to create an aerosol that the user inhales ( 7). An individual's level of 12/2020 371 2 of 11 Clinical/Health/Medical: Nicotine and Tobacco Use exposure to nicotine depends on the amount of nicotine in the ENDS product, as well as on product charact eristics, device operation, and the user's inhalation pattern. Exhaled ENDS vapor has been shown to contain chemicals that can cause cancer, can harm the fetus , and are a source of indoor air pollution ( 8, 9, 10). Data from the CDC's 2015 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) for Oklahoma and Texas indicated that maternal use of ENDS was 10% before pregnancy and 7% around the time of conception . Among the women who reported using ENDS during the last 3 months of their pregnancy, over one -third said that the E NDS used contained nicotine while about a quarter said they were unsure o f the nicotine content. Reported reason s for E NDS use around the time of pregnancy included curiosity, the perception that ENDS might help with quitting or reducin g smoking , and the perception of reduced harm to the mother when compared to cigarette smoking. ( 11) The CDC has stated that ENDS use is not safe for pregnant women ( 12). The continual innovation of novel END S makes healt h risk assessments difficult , and additional research is needed to fully understand ENDS' safety, health effects, and cessation efficacy ( 13). Women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant should consult with their health care provide r on the risks that ENDS pose for bot h maternal a nd neonatal health (14, 15). Smokeless Tobacco According to the CDC, 0.5% of females 18 years and over used smokeless tobacco in 2016 (1 6). Smokeless tobacco products are either chewed or placed in between the cheek and gum or teeth . The tobacco can come as loose dried leaves or finely ground. While these products are meant to be alternatives to cigarettes, no form of smokeless tobacco is a safe substitute. The following table summarizes the conditions associated with increased risk from nicotine and /or tobacco use for the mother and infant : Substance Effects on Mother Effects on Birth Outcomes Effect s on Infant Smoking Tobacco Respiratory Conditions (2): Chronic obstruc tive pulmonary disease (COPD) Emphysema Chronic bronchitis Asthma Heart Conditions (2): Cardiovascular disease Increased he art rate and blood pressure Blood clots Cancers (2): Ectopic pregnancy (2, 17) Miscarriage (2, 1 7) Placenta l abruption (2,17) Early delivery* (2) Low birth weight (2) Preeclampsia (18) Sudden Unexpected Infant Death (S UID) (2, 19) Brain and lung damage (2) Cleft lip and/or cleft palate (2) Asthma ( 20) Respiratory illnesses (19) Potential for nicotine use later in life ( 21) 12/2020 3 of 11 371 Clinical/Health/Medical: Nicotine and Tobacco Use Substance Effects on Mother Effects on Birth Outcomes Effect s on Infant Smoking Tobacco (continued) Bladder Blood Cervix Cancers (2) (continued): Colon and rectum Esophagus Kidney and ureter Larynx and throat Liver Lung Pancreas Stomach Other Conditions (2): Stroke Poor o ral health Diabetes Weaker bones Inflammatio n and decreased immune function Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) Limited data, but potential association with (13): Cardiovascular disease Nicotine exposure effects (13): Preterm birth * Stillbirth Nicotine exposure effects (13): Sudden Unexpected Infant Death (SUID) Impaired brain development Deficits in auditory processing Attention and cognition problems Potential for nicotine use later in life ( 21) Smokeless Tobacco Cancer of the mouth, esophagus, and pancreas (22) Stillbirth (2, 21, 22) Early delivery * (2, 2 2) Impaired brain development (22) Apnea, which is associated with 12/2020 371 4 of 11 Clinical/Health/Medical: Nicotine and Tobacco Use Substance Effects on Mother Effects on Birth Outcomes Effect s on Infant Smokeless Tobacco (continued) Gum disease, tooth decay, and tooth loss (22) Death from heart disease and stroke (22) Low birth weight (2, 21) increased risk of Sudden Unexpected Infant Death (2) *See risk #142 Preterm or Early Term Delivery for more information about early delivery. See risk #141 Low Birth Weight and Very Low Birth Weight for more infor mation about low birth weight . See risk #345 Hypertension and Prehypertension for more infor mation about preeclampsia. Nutrition The research o n tobacco use and its impact on nutritional status has focused on cigarette smoking. Cigarette smoking cause s a generalized upward shift in hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit , which lower s the effectiveness of anemia screening tools . Therefore, pregnant women who smoke may require additional iron supplementation even if their hemoglobin /hemato crit results show they are not anemic. (See risk #201 Low Hematocrit/Low Hemoglobin for more information about cut -offs for determining iron deficiency for women who smoke .) Smoking also increases oxidativ e stress and affects metabolism. Vitamin C is the only micronutrient with a Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) specific to individuals who smoke , with the recommendation of consuming an addition al 35 mg per day compared to those who do not (23). Research indicates that those who smoke have lower concentrati ons of certain nutrients (i.e., B -carotene, vitamin B -12, vitamin B -6 and folic acid) , but due to the observational nature of the research , the exact cause remains unclear (24). Additional research is needed to determine smoking's effect on micronutrients and if additional DRI recommendations for other micronutrients are needed for those who smoke . Smoking Cessation Pregnancy offers an opportunity to quit smoking because pregnant women are highly motivated to take actions to protect the health of their babies . Around 50% of women who smoked during the three months before they conceived quit during pregnancy. However, of those who did quit during pregnancy, about 50% of them returned to smoking after the baby was born. (25) Research has shown that both dosage (number of cigarettes smoked in a day) and timing of maternal smoking (during particular trimesters) are associated with neonatal birth weight. Women who stopped smoking before their third trimester gave birth to infants with similar weights to th ose infants who were never exposed to smoking. Therefore, efforts for smoking cessation should not only be made in the early stages of pregnancy, but should continue throughout pregnancy with an emphasis on the health benefits for the infant if smoking st ops before the third trimester. (2 6) Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is used as an aid for smoking cessation. NRT delivers small doses of nicotine, most commonly using nicotine gum or transdermal nicotine patches. Little research has been conducted to prove the effectiveness and safety for pregnant or postpartum women who engage in NRT (27). The optimal cessation intervention for a pregnant tobacco user is behavioral, as the safety and efficacy of neonatal nicotine exposure while using NRT has not been established. If a behavioral smoking cessation 12/2020 5 of 11 371 Clinical/Health/Medical: Nicotine and Tobacco Use intervention alone is unsuccessful, the American College of Obstet ricians and Gynecologists recommends that NRT only be considered in conjunction with a behavioral intervention and with close monitori ng by a health care provider (2 7). ENDS are often market ed as smoking cessation devices. H owever, due to the differences between products (e.g. tank size s, nicotine amounts, etc.) , it is difficult for health organizations and researchers to determine how effecti ve all ENDS are for helping people to quit smoking (25). The FDA does not approve of using ENDS to help people quit smoking (28). Breastfeeding In 2001, the Amer ican Academy of Pediatrics removed nicotine from its list of contraindicated substances during breastfeeding , indicating that the benefits of breastfeeding while smoking outweigh the alternative of smoking and formula feeding (29). Therefore, m aternal use of nicotine and tobacco should not prohibit a mother from breastfeeding her child ( 30 31). Breastfeeding while smoking may help reduce some of the harmful effects of prenatal smoking on infants, incl uding acute respiratory illness and asthma ( 32, 33). However, women who smoke cigarettes are less likely to initiate breastfeed ing than those who do not, possibly re vealing that there is a psychosocial factor responsible for lower rates of breastfeeding among women wh o smoke cigarettes (3 1, 34). This is an opportunity for WIC staff to inform participants of the health benefits and to encourage them to breastfeed despite their use of tobacco. Nicotine has been found to have multiple effects on breastmilk. Nicotine can transfer to an infant through breastmilk (3). Nico tine lowers pr olactin levels (3 5, 36), which has been associated with reduced breast milk supply (37, 38) and reduced milk fat content (3). Additional changes in milk composition and flavor due to maternal smoking may contribute to an infant's early weaning from breastm ilk (39). Smoking in the presence of an infant or child can expose them to secondhand smoke, which has negative health outcomes (30). (See risk #904 Environmental Tobacco Smoke Exposure for more information. ) If a woman chooses to continue her nicotine and tobacco use while breastfeeding, she should not do it in the presence of the infant ( 30, 31). Additionally, it is recommended that a breastfeeding woman who uses nicotine should first breastfeed her infant and then use the product (8, 30, 40). This timing will help minimize the amount of nicotine in her breastmilk the next time she breastfeeds (8, 30 , 40). Implications for WIC Nutrition Services WIC staff can provide the following nutrition services to women who use nicotine and/or tobacco : Administe r State or local a gency substance use screening methods. For more information, please see: WIC Substance Use Prevention resource , Chapter 5: https://wicworks.fns.usda.gov/resources/wic - substance -use-prevention -guide Provi de a safe and supportive environment when discussing nicotine and/or tobacco use. For more information on techniques for delivering effective messages, please see: WIC Substa nce U -substance -use-prevention -guide Consider all potential nicotine and/or tobacco delivery methods participants may be using. Explain the importance of eliminating or reducing the amount of tobacco and/or nicotine use, especially before the third trimester if pregnant. Explain that ENDS ha ve variable amounts of nicotine and are not safer alternatives to cigarettes. 12/2020 371 6 of 11 Clinical/Health/Medical: Nicotine and Tobacco Use Encourage fruit and vegetables that are high in vitamin C intake to achieve adequate antioxidant and vitamin C consumption. Highlight WIC foods, especially 100% juice that are good sources of vitamin C and o ther important nutrients. Encourage high iron fruits and vegetables . If the participant is taking an iron supplement, provid e recommendation s for minimizing gastro -intestinal side effects and foods that can improve iron bioavailability . For more informat ion, please see: https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Iron - HealthProfessional/ . Offer the following suggestions to minimize secondhand smoke exposure to the infant (30, 35): o Avoid smo king in infant's presence. o Smoke outside. o Ask other smokers to avoid smoking around the infant or other children. o Have smoke -free rules for the car and home. o Change clothes and wash hands after smoking and prior to handling the infant. Refer to a state quit line (1 -800-QUIT -NOW), text -based program (text QUIT to 47848) or a local in - person smoking cessation program. Refe r to their health care provider to discuss the health implications of using NRT while pregnant or breastfeeding. WIC staff can provide t he following nutrition services to breastfeeding women who use nicot ine and/ or tobacco : Provid e breastfeeding promotion and support and inform participants of the health benefits of human milk for infants of mothers who smoke. Utilize the pa rticipant -focused WIC Breastfeeding Support website topic at: https://wicbreastfeeding.fns.usda.gov/breastfeeding -and-alcohol -drugs -and-smoking . Recommend mothers to refrain from smoking /vaping until right after a feeding so that nicotine level will have time to decrease before the next feeding. Counsel women who use NRT to time its use for after breast feeding and to not use at nigh t. Provid e anticipatory guidance about the possible effect of nicotine on breast milk supply.

Any illegal substance use and/or abuse of prescription medications . Any marijuana use in any form (breastfeeding women only). Participant Category and Priority L evel Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I Non- Breastfeeding Women III, IV, V or VI Justification Substance us e and misuse during pregnancy and postpartum may have physical and mental health consequences ranging from mild to serious (2). The use of alcohol, marijuana, illegal drugs and misuse of prescription drugs can threaten both maternal and fetal health. Misuse s of prescription drugs include using medications as follows: for nonmedical reasons , prescribed for someone else , more often than the prescribed frequency , in larger -than- prescribed doses , and/ or over a longer time than prescribed (3). Substance use is known to lead to vitamin and mineral deficiencies that threaten physical and mental health, damage vital organs and the nervous system, and decrease immunity. Malnutrition occurs when the substance replaces other dietary nutrients or as a result from improper nutrient metabolism, absorption, utilization, or excretion even though the diet may be adequate. Harmful lifestyles are often associated with addiction, such as poor eating patterns, lack of exercise, and changes in sleep patterns. These compounding factors result in an increased risk of long -term health problems, including metabolic syndrome, diabetes, hypertension, weight problems, and eating disorders . People with substance addiction may suffer from calorie and protein malnutritio n. In one study over 90% were underweight and 70% had 06/2018 372 2 of 9 Clinical/Health/Medical: Alcohol and Substance Use vitamin D deficiency and low levels of vitamin C. Another study showed that 50% were deficient either in iron or vitamins (vitamins A, C, and E being the most common). (4) Substance use can impact the family and parenting in a number of ways, and may be linked with poor parenting practices, child neglect, and abuse due to (2): Impairments (both physical and mental) caused by alcohol or other drugs . Domestic violence, which may be a result of substance use. Expenditure of often limited resources on purchasing alcohol or other drugs . Frequent arrests, incarceration, and court dates . Time spent seeking out manufacturing or using alcohol or other drugs . Estrangement from primary family and related supp ort. While substance use has long been a public health concern, t here is growing recognition that the Unit ed States is facing an epidemic due to an increase in opioid misuse, use disorders, and overdose, and that disparities exist between men and women with regard to both prescription opioid and heroin use (5). Although between 1999 and 2014 men were more likely than women to die of opioid overdoses, the gap in mortality has been closing (6). Between 1999 and 2010, overdose deaths from prescription pain killers increased more than 400% among women, compared to an increase of 237% among men (7). Although nonmedical use of prescription opioids among women has generally been decreasing since then, heroin use among women has been increasing, and at a faster rate among women than among men (8, 9, 10 ). For example, between 2002 and 2013, heroin use among women increased 100% compared to an increase of 50% among men (5). Predictors of substance use among women of child bearing age include (2, 11, 12 ): Early Substance Use - Tobacco or marijuana use at an early age (12 - 18 years of age) is a risk factor for continued use as an adult. Prepregnancy Substance Use - Alcohol and drug use prior to pregnancy is a predictor of continue d us e during pregnancy. Demographi c Characteristics - Use and substance choice vary by demographic group: o Substance use after pregnancy is more likely for Native Americans and Africa n A mericans. o African American women and economically disadvantaged women are morelikely to use illicit substances, particularly cocaine. o White women and women with higher education levels are more likely to use alcohol. Trauma - Substance use is increased among women who: o Were raised by parents who abused substances. o Have experienced physical and/or sexual abuse. o Have experienced intimate partner violence. Mental Health - Women with a diagnosis of substance use or chemical dependency may have one or more psychiatric disorders. 06/ 2018 3 of 9 372 Clinical/Health/Medical : Alcohol and Substance Use Alcohol and Substance Use during Pregnancy Maternal substance use during and after pregnancy can have a long- term impact on both the mother and her child and can impact many areas of life such as: (2 , 13, 14 ) Obstetrical and Prenatal Complications - Substance use (and withdrawal from them) duri ng pre gnancy may cause constriction of uterine blood vessels leading to insuffic ient blood flow to the placenta, separation of the placenta from the uterus , maternal hypertension , materna l h emorrhage, and/or premature labor. These complications may in turn increase risk of fetal loss, premature birth and still birth. Personal Health and Safety - Substance use is associated with increased likelihood of death by i llness, accident or suicide; intimate partner violence; sexually transmitted diseases and unintende d pregnancy. Although 31% to 47% of U.S. pregnancies are unintended, the proportio n o f unintended pregnancies for women with opioid use disorder was higher than 85%, according to recent research . Societal Impacts - Substance use is associated with an unstable family structure, separation an d di vorce, and potential for involvement of Child Protective S ervices (CPS). The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5106a(b)] requires States to have policies and procedures in place to no tify CPS agencies of su bstance -exposed newborns and to establish a plan of safe care for newborns identified as being affected by illegal substance abuse or having withdrawal symptoms resulting from prenatal drug exposure. For more information ab out State- spec ific requirements please see : https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/systemwide/laws- policies/state/ . Impact on Children - Children who are exposed to alcohol and other subs tances prior to birth can experience long -term cognitive, behavioral, social and emotional developmental consequences. Based on data collected by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) , in 2012- 2013 alcohol use among pregnant women aged 15- 44 was 9.4% ; 2.3% reporte d binge drinking and 0.4% reported heavy drinking. These rates were lower than the rates for non -pregnant women in the same age group (55.4%, 24.6% and 5.3% respectively). Alcohol use in 2012- 2013 was lower among pregnant women aged 15 to 44 during the second and third trimesters than during the first trimester (5.0 % and 4.4% vs. 19. 0%). (3) Nutritional needs during pregnancy are 10 to 30 percent greater than normal (15). Alcohol can disrupt body function s by causing nutrient deficiencies of vitamins and minerals (4) . Alcohol inhibits fat absorption and thereby impairs absorption of v itamins A, E, and D which are normally absorbed along with dietary fats. Deficiencies of minerals such as calcium, magnesium , iron, and zinc are common in people who misuse alcohol , although alcohol itself does not seem to affect the absorption of these minerals (4). There is no safe consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. Exposure to alcohol in utero can damage the developing fetus at any stage and is the leading preventable cause of birth defects and intellectual and neurodevelopmental disabilities (16 , 17). Not only can nutritional deficiencies of a mother who misuses alcohol adversely affect the nutrition of the fetus, b ut alcohol itself can also restrict nutrient flow to the fetus. These prenatal factors can result in the infant being born with a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is the most severe type of FASD. Fetal A lcohol Syndrome can affect children in different ways. A child with FAS might have abnormal facial features, growth and central 06/2018 372 4 of 9 Clinical/Health/Medical: Alcohol and Substance Use nervous system problems as well as problems with learning, memory, attention span, communication, vision, or hearing (18). (See risk 382 - Fetal Alcohol Syndrome for more information.) In 2012 and 2013 illicit drug use (to include marijuana use) among pregnant women aged 15 to 44 was 5.4%. This was lower than the rate among women in this age group who were not pregnant (11.4% ). Illicit drug use in 2012 -2013 was lower among pregnant women aged 15 to 44 during the third trimester than during the first and second trimesters (2.4% t vs. 9 .0% and 4.8 %). (3) Marijuana is the illicit drug used most frequently by women of child -bearing age (19). There is no known safe amount of marijuana use during pregnancy. Marijuana contains tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is the chemical in marij uana that makes one feel \"high\". Marijuana may be ingested in the form of marijuana edibles (cookies, brownies, candy, etc.) or inhaled when smoked. When inhaled, the smoke goes in to the lungs and immediately passes through the membrane s and enters the bloodstream (2). THC can pass from the mother to the unborn child through the placenta if marijuana is ingested or inhaled during pregnancy. Children who are exposed to THC prior to birth can experience decreased academic ability, cognitive function and ability to remain attentive (20). Although some states have legalized marijuana for a variety of medical conditio ns upon a doctor's recommendation, as well as for recreational use , marijuana has been shown to have negative effects on brain development. T herefore, it is recommended that pregnant and breastf eeding women not use marijuana (2) . National Surveys on Drug Use and Health done by SAMHSA indicate that an annual average of about 21,000 pregnant women aged 15 to 44 misused opioids in the past month (21). The percentage of women misusing opioids in the past month was lower among pregnant women aged 15 to 44 than among non-pregnant women in that age range (0.9% vs. 2 .6%) (21 ). Opiates and Percocet , morphine, dilaudid) have serious health risks associated with their use including endocarditis; coma or sud den death from overdose; risk of HIV; and, if injected, viral hepatitis and other infections (2). A mother's use of these substances during preg nancy can lead to neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), which is a series of withdrawal symptoms experienced by an infant after birth due to intra uterine exposure to substances. Prenatal exposure to opioids increases the risk of low birth weight, stillbirth and sudden infant death syndrome (see risk 383 - Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome for more information ). For a summary of the effects of alcohol, marijuana, opi oids and more information about the effects of other specific drugs during pregnancy, see table o n page 5. Alcohol and Substance Use during Breastfeeding The breastfeeding mother should minimize alcohol use and avoid the use of other substances since most maternally ingested substances are transferred to human milk , though the concentration and potential danger to the breastfed baby is affected by interaction among a variety of factors. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that the ingestion of beverages containing alcohol be minimized and limited to occasional intake for breastfeeding women. T he following are recommendations for breastfeeding women who choose to drink (2, 22 , 23, 24 ): Consult with health care provider before consuming alcohol. Do so only if br eastfeeding is well established, consistent and predictable (no earlier than 3 months postpartum). Minimize i ngestion of alcoholic b everages and limit it to occasional i ntake. 06/ 2018 5 of 9 372 Clinical/Health/Medical : Alcohol and Substance Use Consume only a single alcoholic drink and wait at least 4 hours before breastfeeding or expressing milk to ensure the alcohol is not present in the milk . Breastfeed the infant or express human milk before consuming the alcohol. Due to the lipophilic nature of THC found in marijuana, it is tremendo usly fat -soluble and therefore is readily transferred to huma n milk. Marijuana can impact the neurobehavioral development of the infant , and the AAP considers it to be a contraind ication to breastfeeding . (2, 22, 23 ) The maternal use of illegal substances and the misuse of prescription medicine is a contraindicatio n to breastfeeding. However, a ccording to the AAP, appropriate maternal use of prescribed medication is not a categorical contraindication to breastfeeding. For situations in which the mother is undergoing pharmacologic therapy, breastfeeding must balanc e the benefits to infants and mother against the potential risk of su bstance exposure to the infant. For example, research has shown that adequately nourished narcotic -dependent mothers should be encouraged to breastfeed if they are enrolled in a supervised medication -assisted treatment program and have negative toxicology screen s for HIV and illicit drugs. (22) (See risk 383 - Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome for more information.) The following table is a summary of effects of specific drugs on the moth er, birth outcomes and breastfeeding (2).

Implications for WIC Nutrition Services Through established linkages and coordination with local resources, WIC staff are required to refer participants suspected of substance use , and those who disclose substance use, to existing assessment agencies for professional evaluation and treatment, as approp riate. In addition to providing referrals and coordinating /facilitating services, WIC's role in preventing substance abuse is to educate women participants , parents, and caretakers of participating infants and children about substance use -related problems with the intended effects of increas ing participants' access to information about the dangers of substance use and abuse during pregnancy and breastfeeding as well as postpartum. WIC also provides supplemental foods that are rich in the nutrients lost from alcohol and substance misuse . WIC s taff can assist participants by: Providing referrals (and follow -up on the referral) for professional assessment and treatment. Do n ot advise a woman who uses narcotics to stop use on her own. This step should be taken only u nder the supervision of a physician or treatment specialist. Encouraging women to improve their lifestyle and health habits during pregnancy and postpartum , since t he concern for fetal health and/or the desire to be a good role model can be a powerful motivator to reduce or stop substance use (25). Emphasizing the importance of substance abuse treatment during the postpartum period to safeguard the health of th e mother and reduce the risk in subsequent pregnancies. 06/ 2018 7 of 9 372 Clinical/Health/Medical : Alcohol and Substance Use Recomme nding the Dietary Guidelines for Americans to addr ess nutrition deficiencies associated with substance use.

Periodontal disease s are infections that affect the tissues and bone tha t support the teeth. Periodontal diseases are classified according to the severity of the disease. The two major stages are gingivitis and periodontitis. Gingivitis is a milder and reversible form of periodontal dise ase that only affects the gums. Gingivitis may lead to more serious, destructive forms of periodontal disease called periodontitis.(2) More information on types of periodontal disease is available at : http://www.perio.org/consumer/2a. html . Tooth loss, ineffectively replaced teeth or oral infections which impair the ability to ingest food in adequate quantity or quality Presence of oral health conditions diagnosed , documented, or reported by a physician, dentist, or someone working und er a physician's orders, or as self reported by applicant/participant/caregiver. See Clarification for more information about self- reporting a diagnosis. Participant Category and Priority L evel Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I Non -Breastfeeding Women III, IV, V or VI Infants I Children III Justification Oral health reflects and influences general health and well being. Good oral health care and nutrition during pregnancy, infancy and childhood are often overlooked factors in the growth and development of the teeth and oral cavity . Infants and Children The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that dental caries may be the most prevalent infectious disease in U.S. children. More than 40% of children have tooth decay by the time they reach kindergarten. Infants that consume sugary foods , are of low socioeconomic status, and whose mothers have a low education lev el, are 32 times more likely to have caries at the age of 3 years than children who 11/2013 381 2 of 8 Clinical /Health/Medical: Oral Health Conditions do not have those risk factors . Despite its high prevalence, early childhood caries (ECC) is a preventable disease. (3) ECC may develop as soon as teeth erupt. Bacteria, predominantly mutans streptococci (MS), metabolize simple sugars to produce acid that deminerali zes teeth, resulting in cavities. The exact age at which MS colonization occurs in children is controversial, but it does not happen until teeth erupt. The earlier colonization occurs, the greater the risk of caries. MS typically originates in the mother and is transmitted to the ch ild via saliva (often through cup and utensil sharing ). Elevated maternal levels of MS, due to active or untreated caries and frequent sugar consumption, inc rease the risk of transmission. In addition, recent evidence sugges ts that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke increases the likelihood of MS colonization in children. (4 ) Historically, ECC has been attributed to inappropriate and prolonged bottle use; formally called \"baby bottle tooth decay.\" However, r ecent studies indicate that the disease is mul tifactorial , which suggests a ny feeding practice that allows frequent sugar consumption in t he presence of MS may result in caries formation: p ropped bottles containing sweetened liquids or formula, frequent consump tion of juice or sweetened liquids from infant and \"sippy\" cups, and frequent snacking of high cariogenic foods . (4) The frequency of sugar consumption is the main dietary variable in caries etiology. After bacteria metabolize sugar into acid, it takes 2 0-40 minutes for the acid to be neutralized or washed away by saliva. Therefore, if sugars are frequently consumed, the potential fo r demineralization is greater. Although MS can metabolize many different carbohydrates, they produce acid most efficiently from sugars, especially sucrose. Sugars within the cellular structure of food (such as fructose in whole fruit) are thought to be less cariogenic than sugars intentionally added to foods. (4 ) See Table 1 for more information o n the cariogenic potential of children's foods and snacks. Milk is widely consumed, especially by children, and thus the interaction between different kinds of milk consumed and caries development has been a research topic of interest. Lactose is one o f the least cariogenic sugars because it is poorly met abolized by MS. Researchers have reported cows' milk to be a protective, anticariogenic agent due to its high concentration of calcium and phosphate. The buffering activity of proteins present in cows ' milk also might allow the formation of very stable complexes of calcium phosphate. Other anticariogenic properties in cows' milk include a ntibacterial enzymes, vitamin D and fluoride . (4,5) Infant formulas, on the other hand, have a high potential for inducing caries due to their high carbohydrate variability. The cariogenic potential of human milk is inconclusive . Human milk has bee n found to contain more lactose (8.3%) than cows' milk (4.9%). A higher human milk lactose concen tration and the possi bility that lactose ferment ation of cows' milk is slower than in human milk , may make human milk caries risk slightly higher . Some evidence indicates that breastfeeding for over 1 year during the night after tooth eruption might be associated with ECC, however other investigations showed no relationship between prevalenc e of caries and breastfeeding. Regardless of the type of milk consumed , sufficient dental care and cleaning after drinking milk/formula and breastfeeding can help prevent ECC. Avoiding inappropriate dietary practices, such as frequent juice consumption or snacking on highly cariogenic foods also remain important ECC preventive practices .

Adapted from: Faine, MP. Nutrition and oral health. In: Proceedings of Promoting Oral Health of Children with Neurodevelopmental Disabilities and Other Special Health Care Needs. May 4 -5, 2001. Seattle, WA. Women Maternal periodontal disease and dental cari es may impact pregnancy outcome, and the off spring's risk of developing early and severe dental caries. Periodontal disease and caries may also increase the women's risk of atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes. These oral health problems are highly prevalent in women of childbearing age , particularly among low -income women and members of rac ial and ethnic minority groups. Socioeconomic factors, lack of resources to pay for care, barriers to access care, lack of public understanding of the importance of oral health and effective self -care practices all represent underlying reasons cited for observed inadequacies in oral health. (6) 11/2013 381 4 of 8 Clinical /Health/Medical: Oral Health Conditions Maternal periodontal disease, a chronic infection of the gingiva (gums) and supporting tooth structures, has been associated with preterm birth, low birthwe ight and development of preeclampsia (6, 7). Studies indicate that periodontal infection can result in placental -fetal exposure and, when coupled with a fetal inflammatory response , can lead to preterm delivery (7). Additionally, in a cohort of 164 young , minority, pregnant and postpartum women, the preterm/low birthweight rate was 5.4% lower among women who received periodontal treatment than those who did not receive treatment (7). In a case -control st udy, researchers found that pre eclamptic patients w ere 3.5 times more likely to have periodontal disease than normotensive patients (6). (See nutrition risk criterion #304 History of Preeclampsia for more information. ) Fluoride and Fluorosis Use of fluorides for the prevention and control of caries is documented to be both safe and highly effective. Fluoride, a naturally occurring substance, has several caries -protective mechanisms of action, including enamel remineralization and altering bacterial metabolism to help prevent caries. Excessive intake of fluoride can cause dental f luorosis which is a change in the appearance of the tooth's enam el. In the U.S., fluorosis appears mostly in the very mild or mild form - as barely visible lacy white markings or spots. The severe form of dental fluorosis, staining and pitting of the t ooth surface, is rare in the U.S. The CDC reports that 32% of American children have some form of dental fluorosis, with 2.45 % of children having the moderate to severe stages. ( 8, 9, 10, 11) Parents and caregivers may have questions and concerns about fluoride content in water supplies and in infant formula. Fluoridated water can be found in communities that supplement tap water with fluoride and it may also be found in well water. The CDC's My Water's Fluoride website: http://apps.nccd.cdc.gov/MWF/Index.asp , allows consumers in curren tly participating States to learn the fluoridatio n status of their water system. All formula, including powdered, concentrate and ready- to-feed , contain fluoride, but most infant formula manufacturers ensure low levels of fluoride (8). WIC State and local agencies should refer caregivers of formula fed infants with questions regarding the use of fluori dated vs. non- fluoridated water to prepare infant formula to the infants' health care provider . Dental Care and Anxiety It is report ed that 50% of the U.S. p opulation does not seek regular dental care. Of the entire U.S. population, 8 -15% has dental phobias. Dental fear can be directly learned from previous painful or negative experiences or indirectly learned from family, friends and the media. Negative portrayal of dentistry by these sources adds to an individual's anxiety. Anxiety and/or fear of dental procedures may prevent participants from seeking necessary dental care during high risk periods of the life cycle (e.g., pregnancy). Dental providers are learning to understand the causes of dental fear, have techniques to assess the level of fear and have modified treatments to accommodate patient s with high anxiety levels. (12) Oral Health Problems and Special Health Care Needs The following special health care needs can increase the risk for oral health problems and can also make the overall effects of poor oral health more sev ere (13): Prematurity and intrauterine malnutrition - can have adverse effects on an individual's oral health. A study of infants who weighed <2000g at birth indicated more porous dental enamel andsubsurface lesions. Infants with very low birthweights (<150 0g) are more apt to have enamel 11/2013 5 of 8 381 Clinical/Health/Medical: Oral Health Conditions defects of the primary teeth. Malnutrition in the first few months of life (when oral structures develop) can increase the risk for oral problems. Gastro esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) - common among children w ith cerebral palsy , Down syndrome and other conditions . GERD can contribute to oral health problems. A s acidic gastri c c ontents are regurgitated, primary and permanent teeth can be eroded. Failure to thrive and other problems with weight gain and growth - frequent meals and snacks (which may contribute to caries development) may be needed to maintain an adequate energ y i ntake, or if mealtime is longer than usual, the demineralization period may exceed remineralization. Delayed weaning and children sipping on a bottle throughout the day, could also contribute to oral health problems. Craniofacial malformations - individuals with these malformations are at higher ri sk of developing oral problems. For example, children with cleft lip/palate disorders have m ore decayed, missing, and filled teeth than children without. Compromised immune function - individuals with AIDS or those who take immunosuppressive medications are more susceptible to oral infections such as candidiasis, viral infections, dental caries , and periodontal disease. Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) - individuals with Down syndrome often have delayed dental development*, may be missing permanent teeth, and may have under -developed teeth or teeth with thin enamel . In addition, the potential for ea ting problems and GERD make oral care for individuals with Down's especially im portant. (13) *Delayed Tooth Eruption (DTE) is the emergence of a tooth into the oral cavity at a time that deviatessignificantly from norms established f or different races, et hnicities , and sexes. Variation in the normal eruption of teeth is a common finding, but significant deviations from established norms should alert theclinician to further investigate the pa tient's health and development. Eruption depends on genetics, growth of the jaw, muscular action and other factors. DTE is seen in children with certain genetic disorders, particularly Down syndrome, and in children with general developmental delays that involve the oralmusculature. Whenever DTE is generalized, the child should be examined for systemic diseases affecting eruption, such as endocrine disorders, organ failures, metabolic disorders, drugs and inherited disorders.(14)Additional information about tooth eruption is available at : http://www.ada.org/2930.aspx . Dentate Status, Diet Quality and General Health By the time individuals reach adulthood, the human mouth has progressed from 20 primary teeth to 32 permanent (adult) teeth (2). The e xtent to which tooth loss can adversely affect nutritional status is not completely known. However, diet quality tends to decline as the degree of dental impairment increases. Studies have shown that intake of vitamin A, fiber, calcium and other key nutrients decline as the number of teeth decline. In The Health Professionals study, participants without teeth had diets that contained fewer vegetables, less carotene and fiber, and more cholesterol, saturated fat, and calories than persons with 25 teeth or more (15). Despite the trend toward increased tooth retention throughout adult life in developed countries, 11% of adults aged 25 and older have lost all of their natural teeth. This number increases to 30% for people over age 65 and is even higher in those living in poverty. Loss of teeth is not a normal result of the aging process; the major cause of tooth loss is extractions resulting from dental caries and/or periodontal disease. (15 ) 11/2013 381 6 of 8 Clinical /Health/Medical: Oral Health Conditions Implications for WIC Nutrition Services To help prevent oral h ealth problem s from developing and ensure the best possible health and developmental outcomes, WIC staff can encourage participants and caregivers to : Diet Breastfeed infants during the first year of life and beyond as mutually desired. Avoid having a n infant/ child sleep with a bottle. A ny bottle taken to bed should contain onl y wa ter. (See Risk s 425.3 and 411.2) Gradually introduce a cup between 6 and 12 months of age, wean from the bottle by 12 months of age . Drink/provide only water and milk betwe en meals . Limit sugary foods and drinks (if sweets are eaten, it's best to restrict to mealtimes .) Avoid carbonated beverages and juice drinks . (See Risk 425.2) Limit the intake of 100% fruit juice to no more than 4 -6 ounces per day. Establish eating patt erns that are consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the infant feeding practice guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics . Consume /provide a varied, balanced diet during gestation and throughout childhood t o set th e s tage for optimal oral health . (1,3,4,15) Oral Hygiene Wipe the gums of even a very small infant with a soft washcloth or soft toothbrush, even prior to tooth eruption, to establish a daily oral hygiene routine (17, 18). Brush teeth (including an infant's, as soon as teeth erupt ) thoroughly twice daily (morning a nd e vening) and floss at least once every day. Minimize saliva sharing activities (i.e., sharing a drinking cup and utensils) . (1,3,4,15 ) Fluoride Use fluoride toothpaste approved American Dental Association (\"pea -size\" for 2 -5 year olds and, \"smear\" for under the age of two and at moderate or high caries risk) . (1) Rinse every night with an alcohol -free over -the- counter mouth rinse with 0.05% sodium fluoride (guidance for woman participant and ca regiver only ). (3) Contact the infant's (if formula fed ) health care provider with questions regarding the use of local drinking water or bottled water to prepare infant formula . (3) Talk to the dentist about fluoride supplements . These may be of benefit in reducing dental deca y f or children living in fluoride -deficient areas (See Risk 411.11). Check if the public water systems have added fluoride at: http://apps.nccd.cdc.gov/MWF/Index.asp . Access the following website for more information about fluoride : http://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/safety.htm . 11/2013 7 of 8 381 Clinical/Health/Medical: Oral Health Conditions Referrals Establish a dental home within 6 months of eruption of the first tooth and no later than 1 2 mo nths of age. (3) See a dentist for examination s (every 6 months) and/or restoration of all active decay as soon as possible . (WIC staff should provide dental referrals as necessary.)

Clarification Self-reporting of a diagnosis by a medical professional should not be confused with self -diagnosis, where a person simply claims to have or to have had a medical condition without any reference to professional diagnosis. A self -reported medical diagnosis (\"My doctor says that I have/my son or daughter has...\") should prompt the CPA to validate the presence of the condition by asking more pointed questions related to that diagnosis. 05/2019 Nut 1 of 7 382 Clinical/Health/Medical : Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder 382 Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder s Definition /Cut -off V alue Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder s (FASDs) are a group of conditions that can occur in a person whose mother consumed alcohol during pregnancy (1). FASDs is an overarching phrase that encompasses a range of possible diagnoses, including fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial fetal alcohol syndrome (pFAS), alcohol - related birth defects (ARBD), alcohol -related neurodevelopm ental disorder (ARND), and neurobehavioral with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND -PAE) (2) . Presence of condition diagnosed, documented, or reported by a physician or someone working under a physician's orders, or as self -reported by applic ant/participant/caregiver. See Clarification for more information about self -reporting a diagnosis. Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I Non -Breastfeeding Women III, IV, V or VI Infants I Children III Justification Prenatal exposure to alcohol can damage the developing fetus and is the leading preventable cause of birth defects and intellectual and neurodevelopmental disabilities (2). (See risk #372 Alcohol and Substance Use for more information.) FASD is an umbrella term describing the range of effects that can occur in an individual whose mother consumed alcohol during pregnancy (2) . These effects include physical, mental, behavioral, and/or learning disabilities with poss ible lifelong implications (1, 2) . Often, a person with FASD has a mix of these conditions (1). The term FASDs is not meant for use as a clinical diagnosis and encompasses all other diagnostic terms, such as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) ( 1, 2). FASDs refer to the whole range of effects that can occur in a person whose mother consumed alcohol during pregnancy. These conditions can affect each person in different ways and can range from mild to severe. A person with FASD might have any or a combi nation of the following conditions (1): Facial abnormalities , such as a smooth ridge between the nose and upper lip (this ridge is called the philtrum) . Small head size, short stature , low body weight . Sleep and sucking problems as an infant . 05/2019 382 2 of 7 Clinical/Health/Medical: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Hyperactive b ehavior, difficulty with attention, poor memory, difficulty in school (especially with math), learning disabilities , poor reasoning and judgment skills . Poor coordination, s peech and language delays, intellectual disability or low IQ . Problems with the heart, kidneys, bones , vision, or hearing . The severity of alcohol's effects on a fetus primarily depends on the following (3, 4) : Quantity - the amount of alcohol consumed by a pregnant woman per occasion . Frequency - the rate at which alcohol is consume d or is repeatedly consumed by the pregnant woman . Timing - the specific gestational age of the fetus when alcohol is consumed by the pregnant woman . Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Diagnoses Different terms are used to describe FASDs, depending on the ty pe of symptoms. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) was the first form of FASD discovered and is the most well -known. It represents the most involved end of the FASD spectrum . A diagnosis of FAS requires evidence of prenatal alcohol exposure; evidence of centr al nervous system (CNS) abnormalities (structural or functional); a specific pattern of the following three facial abnormalities: narrow eye openings, a smooth area between the lip and the nose (vs. the normal ridge), and a thin upper lip; and growth defi cits either pr enatally, after birth, or both (1). Fetal Alcohol Syndrome can affect children in different ways. A child with FAS may have problems with learning, memory, attention span, commun ication, vision, and/ or hearing (3). Also, people with FAS often have a hard time in school and tr ouble getting along with others (1). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention worked with a group of experts and organizations to review the research and issued guidelines for diagnosing FAS in 2004 . The guidelines were developed for FAS only. Diagnosing FAS can be challenging du e to other medical disorders, such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Williams syndrome, having similar symptoms and the lack of standard medi cal tests. (1) Partial FAS (pFAS ) involves prenatal alcohol exposure and includes some, but not all, of t he characteristics of full FAS (3). A diagnosis of pFAS requires a confirmed history of prenatal alcohol exposure and CNS abnormalities at the same l evel as FAS. Individuals with pFAS sometimes have growth deficiency or one or more of the facial abnormalities associated with FAS. Individuals with pFAS have the same functional disabilities but may not have the physical appearance of an individual with FAS (5). Alcohol -Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder (ARND) requires evidence of both prenatal alcohol exposure and CNS abnormalities, which may be structural or functional. Functional abnormalities may involve a complex pattern of cognitive or behavioral problems that are not consistent with developmental level and that cannot be explained by factors other than prenatal alcohol exposure (e.g., family background, environment, and other toxicities). Facial abnormalities and growth deficits need not be present (3). People with ARND might have intellectual disabilities and problems with behavior and learning. They might do poorly in school and have difficulties with math, memor y, attention, judgment, and impulse control (1). Alcohol -Related Birth Defects (ARBD) include problems with the heart, kidneys, bones , or hearing. People with ARBDs might have a combination of these (1). ARBD is rarely seen alone but rather as a secondar y disorder accompanying other FASD conditions (e.g., FAS and ARBD) (3). 05/2019 Nut 3 of 7 382 Clinical/Health/Medical : Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Neurobehavioral Disorder Associated with Prenatal Alcohol Exposure (ND -PAE) was first included as a recognized condition in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5 of the American Psyc hiatric Association (APA) in 2013. ND-PAE requires evidence of both prenatal alcohol exposure and CNS involvement, as indicated by impairments in the following three areas: cognition, self -regulati on, and adaptive functioning . A child or youth with ND-PAE will have problems in three areas: 1) thinking and memory, where the child may have trouble planning or may forget material he or she has already learned ; 2) behavior problems, such as severe tantrums, mood issues (for example, irritability), and di fficulty shifting attention from one task to another ; and 3) trouble with day -to-day living, which can include problems with bathing, dressing for the weather, and playing with other children. In addition to the child having problems in these three areas, the mother of the child must have consumed more than minimal levels of alcohol during pregnancy. The APA defines minimal levels of alcohol as more than 13 alcoholic drinks per month of pregnancy (that is, any 30-day period of pregnancy) or more than 2 al coholic drinks in one sitting. (1 , 3) Prenatal Alcohol Exposure (PAE) may be associated with altered acquisition and distribution of body mass with increasing age. In a study conducted by Werts and colleagues , the exploratory data suggested that children with PAE may be at risk for nutritional deficiencies, which are influenced by inappropriate food preferences, disordered eating patterns, medication use, and the stressful dynamics surrounding food preparation and mealtime. PAE may be associated with fem ale obesity, constant snacking, lack of satiety, constipation, and low vitamin D status. The obesity/overweight incidence for the female subjects was 50% (a rate substantially greater than the U.S. average of 31.3%), while the obesity/overweight incidence for the males was well below the U.S. average. The sample size was too small to determine whether obesity rates significantly differed between the sexes. ( 6) Fetal Alcohol Effects (FAE) was previously used to describe intellectual disabilities and problems with behavior and learning in a person whose mother consumed alcohol during pregnancy. In 1996, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) replaced FAE with the terms alcohol -related neurodevelop mental disorder (ARND) and alcohol -related birth defects (ARBD). (1) Growth and Development of Children with FASD The estimated prevalence of FASD in populations of first -grade schoolchildren (~6.5 -7.8 y ears old) is as high as 20 -50 per 1 ,000 in the United States and some Western European countries. ( 7) In a study conducted by Spohr and others, it was found that although the characteristic craniofacial malformations of FAS/FAE diminish ed over time, microcephaly, a poorly developed philtrum , a thin upper lip, and, to a lesser degree, short stature and underweight (in boys) persist ed. In females, adult body weight increase d. Although some catch -up growth occurred, a large proportion of the subjects had growth deficiency. ( 8) Retrospective research demonstrat ed that children may be more affected by prenatal alcohol exposure based on the following variables regarding the mother (3, 4) : Poor pre -pregnancy or prenatal nutrition Multiple pregnancies and births Lower -than -average pre -pregnancy or prenatal weight, h eight, and body mass index (BMI) Maternal smoking Maternal age (effect on child increases with mother's age) Has family members or peers who drink heavily 05/2019 382 4 of 7 Clinical/Health/Medical: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder One study indicated that , anecdotally, children with FASD are often \"picky eaters\", some have autistic -like taste and texture sensitivities, and many have behavioral challenges such as rigidity and oppositionality. Children with FASD had lower intakes of saturated fats, vitamin D, and calcium. They may not meet the recommended intakes for several nutrients and have a dietary pattern that could benefit from improving intakes of dairy products, green leafy vegetables, vegetable oils , nuts, eggs , and fish. Most (>50%) did not meet t he Adequate Intake for fiber, n -3 fatty acids, vitamin K, or choline, or the Recommended Dietary Allowance for vitamin D, vitamin E , or calcium. ( 9) Another study indicated that children with FASD were more likely to have a past diagnosis of underweight. Mean BMI was significantly reduced for males but not females. Abnormal eating patterns are common in children with FASD and may contribute to their delayed growth and nutritional inadequacies. Children with FASD were significantly more likely to experienc e delayed acquisition of age -appropriate eating skills, compared with controls. The median age for solid foods introduction was significantly older for children with FASD as was their age at self -feeding. ( 10) Breastfeeding may prevent or improve neurodev elopment al disorders for children with FASD and has been shown to improve IQ ( 11, 12). Infants with facial abnormalities may have breastfeeding challenges such as difficulty with latch, sucking, or swallowing ; and i ndividualized breastfeeding support will likely be needed (13). (See risk #372 Alcohol and Substance Use for more information regarding breastfeeding and alcohol use.) There is no cure for FASDs, but research shows that early intervention treatment services can improve a child's development. There are many types of treatment options, including medication to help with some symptoms, behavior and education therapy, parent training, and other alternative approaches . Certain protective factors can help reduce the effects of FASD and help people with these conditi ons reach their full potential. Protective factors include diagnosis before 6 years of age; loving, nurturing, and stable home environment during the school years; absence of violence; and involvement in special education and social services. (1) Adults with FASD FASDs last a lifetime. Research to date indicates that, compared to controls, adults with FASDs have increased behavioral problems; are perhaps less efficient and more distractible when completing tasks; have more difficulty wit h paying attention, learning, memory, planning, and analyzing social situations; and feel less confident that they have sufficient resources to cope with their environment. Adults with FASDs have a high rate of psychiatric and personality disorders, probl ems with drugs and alcohol, and difficulties with the law. They are also less likely to obtain a degree, have stable employment, and live independently. Young adults with PAE have increased risks for mental health problems and secondary disabilities, whic h impact s their ability to live independently. ( 1, 14) Implications for WIC Nutrition Services When speaking with a biological mother of a child with an FASD, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the following (15): Building a rapport with the mother and allow her to express her emotions and concerns related to her child's health and the demands of parenting a child with an FASD. Reaffirming the parent as a key part of the child's care team. 05/2019 Nut 5 of 7 382 Clinical/Health/Medical : Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Keeping all lines of com munication and advocacy open as the child's care is coord inated through the medical home. Referring to the National Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome's Circle of Hope Birth Mother's Network that can be contacted in person or online: https://www.nofas.org/circleofhope/ . WIC staff can assist parents/caregivers of infants and children with FASD by : Providing anthropometric monitoring to address underweight , delayed growth, nutritional inadequacies, or overweight issues and concerns. Providi ng individualized food packages tailored to meet the needs of participants. Provid ing nutrition information regarding how to improve the intake of dairy products, green leafy vegetables, vegetable oils , nuts, eggs and fish when appropriate as this may be beneficial ( 9). Provid ing nutrition guidance to help with making appropriate choices for healthy snacks and satiety. Providing s uggestions for addressing age-appropriate feeding skills and behavioral and developmental issues associated with feeding. Encouraging physical activity as it improves glucose tolerance, muscle development, motor coordination, and may stimulate neurogenesis and synaptogenesis ( 10). Referring to their health care provider to discuss nutritional supplements and any growth and development concerns (3). Providing referrals to promote caregiver and infant/child feeding skills, including referrals to local home visiting programs, parenting programs, and early intervention services. Referring to their health care provider for breastfeeding support . These infants may need frequent growth monitoring and re-evaluation of their feeding capacity, so feeding plans will need to be adjusted accordingly. (1 3) WIC staff can assist adult participants with FASD by (also see risk #902 Woman or Infant/Child of Primary Caregiver with Limited Ability to Make Appropriate Feeding Decisions and/or Prepare Food ): Providing individualized nutrition education in an easy -to-understand format that is appropriate for the lear ning level of the participant/caregiver. Most education materials should be written for a 5th to 7th grade reading level. Be sensitive to the unique learning needs and style of the participant/caregiver, which may mean using food models, posters, and han douts. Providing referrals to promote parenting and infant/child feeding skills, including referrals to local home visiting programs, parenting programs, and early intervention services. Encouraging participants/caregivers to follow health care provider 's plan of care. Coordinate with health care providers as needed. Providing individualized food packages, tailored to meet the needs of participants. Some adults with FASD with a limited ability to make appropriate feeding decisions/prepare food may be unable to prepare powde r or concentrate d infant formula. Thus, for the safety of the infant, State WIC Agencies may allow ready -to-feed (RTF) WIC formulas to be issued when it is determined that the caregiver may have difficulty correctly diluting p owder or concentrated formulas. Please refer 05/2019 382 6 of 7 Clinical/Health/Medical: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder to your State WIC Agency's specific policies regarding the issuance of RTF, as policies vary from state to state. Referring to their health care provider to discuss n utritional supplements for pregnant women (3) .

NAS is a combination of physiologic and neurologic symptoms that can be identified immediately after birth and can last up to 6 months after birth (2,3). This condition must be present within the first 6 months of birth and diagnosed, documented, or reported by a physician or someone working under a physician's orders, or as self -reported by the infant's caregiver. See the clarification section for more information about self -reporting a diagnosis. Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Infants I Justification Neonatal abstinence syndrome occurs when an infant is born dependent on prescription or illicit drugs the mother was taking during pregnancy. NAS is a combination of withdrawal symptoms that involve multiple bodily systems. It is most commonly associated with chronic opioid exposure during fetal development; however, can also result from chronic intrauterine exposure to other substances includi ng: benzodiazepines, barbiturates, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and ethanol (3). Although these non- opioid substances can lead to NAS, these infants typically respond well to non- pharmacological methods of intervention ( 4). Withdrawal in the newborn varies based on the type of substance, dose, and timing of exposure (4). Opioid is a general term for a variety of illicit and prescription drugs that decrease pain. Prescription opioid pain relievers include oxycodone, hydrocodone, codeine, morphine, and fentanyl. Opioids are water soluble and are, therefore, able to move easily across the placenta to the infant. This transfer of opioids increases as gestational age increases ( 3). Heroin is an illegal opioid that is synthesized from morphine a nd can be injected, inhaled, or smoked. About 23% of individuals who use heroin become dependent (5). Furthermore, those who take any form of opioid, including prescription opioids as directed for chronic pain, can become addicted. Due to the risk of the trans mission of infectious diseases such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C , women who become pregnant while using illicit op ioids , such as heroin, are often put on opioid maintenance therapy. Opioid maintenance therapy involves the prescribed use of either methadone or buprenorphine. These prescribed opioids can still lead to NAS; however, since they are not injected, they decrease the risk of the mother contracting blood borne infectious disease s. Opioid maintenance therapy can al so help protect the fetus from repeated opioid withdrawal in utero ( 6). The incidence of NAS has increased from 1.2 to 3.39 per 1,000 live births from 2000 to 2009 in the United States . This increased incidence is due to an increase in antepartum opioid use from 1.19 to 5.63 per 1,000 live births in the same period ( 7). In another study, it was reported that 5.9% of all women who were pregnant in 2012 reported some illicit drug use during pregnancy ( 4). Infants born with NAS are often 05/2017 383 2 of 5 Clinical/Health/Medical: Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome premature, have low birth weights, and are growth -restricted (see risks #142 Preterm or Early Term Delivery, #141 Low Birth Weight , and #151 Small for Gestational Age for more information about these conditions). (3) In addition to the concerns of exposure to substances in utero, a dditional factors, including social, nutritional, physical, and mental health problems can also contribute to the health status of the infant. An increased risk of certain birth defects has also been associated with early pregnancy opioid use (8). These birth defects include: spina bifida, hydrocephaly, glaucoma, gastroschisis, and heart defects ( 9). Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome Symptoms Symptoms of NAS generally involve the central nervous system, autonomic nervous system, and the gastrointes tinal tract ( 3). The severity of the infant's symptoms is commonly assessed using the Modified Finnegan Score Sheet . The Modified Finnegan Score Sheet consists of 21 symptoms that are associated with NAS. Following the determination of a baseline score, infants are assessed every 4 hours unless the severity of the symptoms requires more frequent monitoring (10). The following list includes symptoms associated with NAS (1, 6): Loud, high- pitched cryin g S weating Yawnin g S leep disturbances Feeding difficulti es Poor weight gain Excessive sucking Regurgitation Diarrhea Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome Treatment Infants with NAS typically have longer hospital stays, can experience serious complications, and have costly treatment ( 2). The first treatment op tion for infants with NAS is to manage symptoms without medication by rooming in with the mother, encouraging skin-to-skin contact, swaddling, having a calm environment, avoiding overstimulation, and supporting breastfeeding (11). Infants who are at risk for NAS and who room -in with their mothers are not only at a lower risk of needing pharmacological treatment for NAS, but they also have a shortened hospital stay ( 12). If withdrawal is severe or if the initial treatment is not successful in managing symp toms of NAS , medications such as morphine , methadone, phenobarbital or clonidine may be used. An infant given these medications may have side effects that could include: slow or shallow breathing, slow heart rate, difficulty waking -up, excessive sleepiness, constipation, and fewer wet diapers ( 11). Nutritional Considerations for Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome The timing and type of feedings play an important role in the management of NAS symptoms. Infants with NAS may have impaired feeding behaviors such as excessive sucking, regurgitation, diarrhea and poor feeding that is characterized by fussi ness, crying, and sleepiness (13, 14). Infants with NAS have higher caloric requirements due to their energy expenditure. This combined with the impaired feeding behaviors may result in difficulty with weight gain (14). The A merican Academy of P ediatrics (AAP) recommends 05/2017 3 o f 5 383 Clinical/Health/Medical: Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome breast feeding if not contraindicated (15). The AAP also recommends that infants with NAS be fed frequent small volumes of human milk or high calorie formula , as needed, in a quiet and calm environment, to aid the infant in tolerating feedings and improving digestion and to allow for adequate growth (11, 15). The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine recommends breastfeeding for women who are on a pres cribed stable dose of methadone maintenance because the concentrations of methadone in human milk are low (16). Studies have indicated that, although the amount of methadone in human milk is dependent on the mother's dose, the methadone transferred in human milk averages less than 2.8% of the maternal dose (17). Breastfeeding has been found to provide protection against the development of NAS symptoms and lessen the severity of symptoms, which would decrease the need fo r pharmacological intervention for the infant (18, 19, 20). The amount of methadone that is in human milk is small and therefore, it is thought that breastfeeding, and not the methadone in human milk, is responsible for its protective impact against NAS (18). Gradual weaning, w hen mutua lly desired by the moth er and infant, is recommended for breastfeeding women who are being treated for opioid addiction. Gradual weaning (rather than an abrupt stop to breastfeeding ) decrease s the risk of the infant developing NAS ( 11, 17). Implications for WIC Nutrition Services NAS can be a difficult subject to talk about with WIC participants due to the stigma of addiction . In the WIC clinic, caregivers may not be forthcoming with the infant's diagnosis of NAS and an addiction history of the mother may not be available at the initial assessment . WIC staff can assist caregivers by: Educating to recognize infant hunger cues . Reviewing feeding frequency and/or formula type and amount to help manage gastrointestinal symptoms of NAS . Providing growth monitoring to assess adequate weight gain. Encouraging supportive interventions to include: o Skin-to-skin contact o Swaddling o Quiet environment with little stimulation Encouraging breastfeeding unless medically contraindicated. Providing referrals for support services such as drug and alcohol counseling, parenting support, and medical evaluations . Encouraging mothers who are on medicat ion-assisted therapy (e.g., methadone or buprenorphine) and who are breastfeeding , to speak with their health care provider if they have questions about the timing and dose of their medication . Educating mothers who are on medication -assisted therapy and w ho are breastfeeding on the importance of gradual weaning when mutually desired by the mother and infant . References 1.

Clarification Self-reporting of a diagnosis by a medical p rofessional should not be confused with self -diagnosis, where a person simply claims to have or have had a medical condition without any reference to professional diagnosis. A self -reported medical diagnosis (\"My doctor says that I have/my son or daughter has...\") should prompt the CPA to validate the presence of the condition by asking more pointed ques tions related to that diagnosis. 06/2012 1 of 3 401 Dietary: Failure to Meet Dietary Guidelines for Americans 401 Failure to Meet Dietary Guidelines for Americans Definition/C ut-off Value Women and children two years of age and older who meet the income, categorical, and residency eligibility requirements may be presumed to be at nutrition risk for failure to meet Dietary Guidelines for Americans [Dietary Guidelines] (1). B ased on an individual's estimated energy needs , the failure to meet Dietary Guidelines risk criterion is defined as consuming fewer than the recommended number of servings from one or more of the basic food groups (grains, fruits, vegetables, milk products, and meat or beans) Note: The Failure to meet Dietary Guidelines for Americans risk criterion can only be used when a complete nutrition assessment has been completed and no other risk criteria have been identified. This includes assessing for risk #425, Inappropriate Nutrition Practices for Children or risk #427, Inappropriate Nutrition Practices for Women . Participant Category and Priority L evel Category Priority Pregnant Women IV Breastfeeding Women IV Non-Breastfeeding Women VI Children 2 years of age V Justification The 1996 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, WIC Nutrition Risk Criteria: A Scientific Assessment, raised questions on the quality of traditional dietary assessment methods (e.g., 24-hour recall and food frequency questionnaires) and recommended further research on the development and validation of diet assessment methodologies ( 2). In response to the 1996 IOM report, the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) commissioned the IOM to review the use of various dietary assessment tools and to make recommendations for assessing inadequate diet or inappropriate dietary patterns, especially in the category of failure to meet Dietary Guidelines (see Clarification) (3). The IOM Committee on Dietary Risk Assessment in the WIC Program approached this task by using the Food Guide Pyramid* recommended number of servings, based on energy needs, as cut-off points for each of the five basic food groups to determine if individuals were meeting the Dietary Guidelines . As a result of the review of the cut-off points for food groups and dietary assessment methods, the IOM published the 2002 report, Dietary Risk Assessment in the WIC Program . The IOM Committee' s findings related to dietary risk, the summary evidence, and the Committee's concluding recommendation are provided below. (4) IOM Committee Findings Related to Dietary Risk (4) (For more information, refer to the specific pages listed.) 06/2012 401 2 of 3 Dietary: Failure to Meet Dietary Guidelines for Americans A dietary risk criterion that uses the WIC applicant's usual intake of the five basic Pyramid * food groups as the indicator and the recommended number of servings based on energy needs as the cut-off points is consistent with failure to meet Dietary Guidelines. (page 130) Nearly all U.S. women and children usually consume fewer than the recommended number of servings specified by the Food Guide Pyramid* and, therefore, would be at dietary risk based on the criterion failure to meet Dietary Guidelines . (page 130) Even research-quality dietary assessment methods are not sufficiently accurate or precise to distinguish an individual's eligibility status using criteria based on the Food Guide Pyramid* or on nutrient intake. (page 131) Summary Evidence Supporting a Presumed Dietary Risk Criterion (4) (For more information, refer to the specific page listed.) Less than 1 percent of all women meet recommendations for all five Pyramid* groups. (page 127) Less than 1 percent of children ages 2 to 5 years meet recommendations for all five Pyramid* groups. (page 127) The percentage of women consuming fruit during 3 days of intake increases with increasing income level. (page 127) Members of low-income households are less likely to meet recommendations than are more affluent households. (page 127) Food-insecure mothers are less likely to meet recommendations for fruit and vegetable intake than are food-secure mothers. (page 127) The percentage of children meeting recommendations for fat and saturated fat as a percentage of food energy increases with increasing income level. (page 127) Low-income individuals and African Americans have lower mean Healthy Eating Index scores than do other income and racial/ethnic groups. (page 127) *The Food Guide Pyramid was the Dietary Guidelines icon at the time the 2002 IOM Committee on Dietary Risk Assessment in the WIC Program conducted the review. The Dietary Guidelines icon has been changed to MyPlate. Although the icon has changed, the Findings and the Supporting Research are still applicable to this criterion. Please see Clarification for more information. Summary Evidence Suggesting that Dietary Assessment Methods are Not Sufficient to Determine a WIC Applicant's Dietary Risk (4) (For more information, refer to the specific page listed.) 24-hour diet recalls and food records are not good measures of an individual's usual intake unless a number of independent days are observed. (page 61) On average, 24-hour diet recalls and food records tend to underestimate usual intake -energy intake in particular. (page 61) Food Frequency Questionnaires and diet histories tend to overestimate mean energy intakes. (page 61) IOM Committee Concluding Recommendation (4) (For more information, refer to the specific page listed.) 06/2012 3 of 3 401 Dietary: Failure to Meet Dietary Guidelines for Americans \"In summary, evidence exists to conclude that nearly all low -income women in the childbearing years and children ages 2 to 5 years are at dietary risk, are v ulnerable to nutrition insults, and may benefit from WIC's services. Further, due to the complex nature of dietary patterns, it is unlikely that a tool will be developed to fulfill its intended purpose with WIC, i.e., to classify individuals accurately with respect to their true dietary risks. Thus, any tools adopted would result in misclassification of the eligibility status of some, potentially many, individuals. By presuming that all who meet the Program's categorical and income eligibility requirements are at dietary risk, WIC retains its potential for preventing and correcting nutrition-related problems while avoiding serious misclassification errors that could lead to denial of services to eligible individuals.\" (page 135) Implications for WIC Nutrition Services As indicated in the 2002 IOM report, most Americans (including most WIC participants) fail to adhere to the Dietary Guidelines . Through participant-centered counseling, WIC staff can: Guide the participant in choosing healthy foods and age-appropriate physical activities as recommended in the Dietary Guidelines . Reinforce positive lifestyle behaviors that lead to positive health outcomes. Discuss nutrition-related topics of interest to the participant such as food shopping, meal preparation, feeding relationships, and family meals. Refer participants, as appropriate, to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), community food banks and other available nutrition assistance programs. References 1.

Clarification The recommendation and findings of the IOM Committee were developed using the 2000 Dietary Guidelines as the standard for a healthy diet. Subsequent to the 2002 IOM report, the Dietary Guidelines have been updated with the release of the 2005 and 2010 Dietary Guidelines . Although the subsequent editions of the Dietary Guidelines are different from the 2000 edition, there is no evidence to suggest that the 2002 IOM recommendation and findings are invalid or inaccurate. The fact remains that diet assessment methodologies may not reflect usual intakes and therefore are insufficient to determine an individual's eligibility status. In addition, future research will be necessary to determine if there is a change in the IOM finding that nearly all Americans fail to consume the number of servings from the basic food groups as recommended in the Dietary Guidelines . 05/2017 1 of 4 411 Dietary: Inappropriate Nutrition Practices for Infants 411 Inappropriate Nutrition Practices for Infants Definition/Cut -off V alue Routine use of feeding practices that may result in impaired nutrient status, disease, or health problems.

During the first year of life, breastfeeding is the normative standard method of infant feeding. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recom mends human milk for the first 12 months of life because of its acknowledged benefits to infant nutrition, gastrointestinal function, host defense, and psychological well-being (1). In addition, the AAP has established exclusive breastfeeding as the standard against which all alternative feeding methods must be measured with regard to growth, health, development, and all other short and lon g-term outcomes for children (2 ). For infants fed infant formula, iron -fortified formula is generally recommended as a subst itute for breastfeeding (1 - 5). Rapid growth and increased physical activity significantly increase the need for iron and utilize iron stores (1). Body stores are insufficient to meet the increased iron needs making it necessary for the infant to receive a dependable source of iron to prevent iron deficiency anemia (1). Iron deficiency anemia is associated with cognitive and psychomotor impairments that may be irreversible, and with decreased immune function, apathy, short attention span, and irri tability (1, 6). Feeding of low- iron infant formula can compromise an infant's iron stores and lead to iron deficiency anemia. Cow's milk has insufficient and inappropriate amounts of nutrients and can cause occult blood loss that can lead to iron defici ency, stress on the kidneys from a high renal solute load, and allergic reactions (1, 4, 6-9 ). Sweetened condensed milk has an abundance of sugar that displaces other nutrients or causes over -consumption of calories (10). Homemade formulas prepared with canned evaporated milk do not contain optimal kinds and amounts of nutrients infants need (1, 6, 9, 10 ). Goat's milk, sheep's milk, imitation milks, and substitute milks do not contain nutrients in amounts appropriate for infants (1, 4, 6, 11, 12). 411.2 Routinely using nursing bottles or cups improperly. Dental caries is a major health problem in U.S. preschool children, especially in low -income populations (13). Eating and feeding habits that affect tooth decay and are started during infancy may continue into early childhood. Most implicated in this disease process is prolonged use of baby bottles during the day or night, containing fermentable sugars, (e.g., fruit juice, soda, and other sweetened drinks), pacifiers dipped in sweet agents such as sugar, honey or syrups, or other high frequency sugar exposures (14 ). The AAP and the American Academy of Pedodontics recommend that juice should be offered to infants (> 6 months of age) in a cup, not a bottle, and that infants not be put to bed with a bottle in their mouths (15, 16). While sleeping with a bottle in his or her mouth, an infant's swallowing and salivary flow decreases, thus creating a poolin g of liquid around the teeth (1 7). The practice of allowing infants to carry or drink from a bottle or training cup of juice for periods throughout the day leads to excessive exposure of the teeth to fermentable carbohydrate s, which promotes the development of dental caries (15 ). Allowing infants to sleep with a nursing bottle containing fermentable carbohydrates or to use it unsupervised during waking hours provides an almost constant supply of carbohydrates and sugars (1). This leads to rapid demineralization of tooth enamel and an increase in the risk of dental caries due to prolonged contact between cariogenic bacteria on the susceptible tooth surface and the sugars in the 05/2017 411 2 of 11 Dietary: Inappropriate Nutrition Practices for Infants consumed liquid (1, 18). The sugars in the liquid pool around the infant's teeth and gums , feed the bacteria there, and decay is the result (19 ). The process may start before the teeth are even fully erupted. Upper incisors (upper front teeth) are particularly vulnerable; the lower incisors are gener ally protected by the tongue (19). The damage begins as whit e lesions and progresses to brown or black discolorati on typical of caries (19). When early childhood caries is severe, the decayed crowns may break off and the permanent teeth dev eloping below may be damaged (19 ). Undiagnosed dental caries and other ora l pain may contribute to feeding problems and failure to thrive in young children (19 ). Unrestricted use of a bottle containing fermentable carbohydrates is a risk because the more times an infant consumes solid or liquid food, the higher the caries risk (1). Feeding behaviors such as unrestricted use of the bottle and frequent snacking can be habit forming in later infancy and may carry over into toddler -hood. Frequent cariogenic snacks eaten between meals place the toddler at high risk for caries deve lopment; this includes the habit of continually sipping from cups (or bottles) containing cariogenic liquids (juice, milk , soda, or sweetened liquid) (19 ). If inappropriate use of the bottle persists, the child is at risk of toothaches, costly dental treatment, loss of primary teeth, and developmental lags on eating and chewing. If this continues beyond the usual weaning period, there is a risk of decay to permanent teeth. Propping the bottle deprives infants of vital human contact and nurturing which mak es them feel secure. It can also cause ear infections because of fluid entering the middle ear and not draining properly; choking from liquid flowing into the lungs; and tooth decay from prolonged exposure to car bohydrate -containing liquids (20). Adding s olid food to a nursing bottle results in force -feeding, inappropriately increases the energy and nutrient composition of the formula, deprives the infant of experiences important in the development of feeding behavior, and could cause an infant to choke (1 , 11, 21, 22). 411.3 Routinely offering complementary foods or other substances that are inappropriate in type or timing. Infants, especially those living in poverty, are at high risk for devel oping early childhood caries (13). Most implicated in thi s disease process are : prolonged use of baby bottles containing fermentable sugars, (e.g., fruit juice, soda, and other sweetened drinks) during the day or night ; pacifiers dipped in sweet agents such as sugar, honey or syrups ; or other hi gh frequency suga r exposures (14 ). The AAP recommends exclusive breastfeeding through 6 months of age (1). Feeding solid foods too early (i.e., before 6 months of age) by, for example, adding dilute d cereal or other solid foods to bottles deprives infants of the opportuni ty to lea rn to feed themselves (4 , 11, 23). The major objection to the introduction of solids before 6 months of age is based on the possibility that it may interfere with establishing sound eating habits and may contribute to overfeeding (6 ,24). In early infancy , the infant possesses an extrusion reflex that enables him/her to swallow only liquid foods (1, 13, 25). The extrusion reflex is normally diminished by 6 months of age (1 ). Breast milk or iron -fortified infant formula is all the infant need s. Gastric secretions, digestive capacity, renal capacity and enzymatic secretions are low, which makes digestion of solids inefficient and potentially harmful (6, 24, 25). Furthermore, there is the potential for antigens to be developed against solid fo ods, due to the undigested proteins that may permeate the gut ; however, the potential for developing allergic reactions may primarily be in infants with a strong family history of atopy (6 , 24). If solid foods are introduced before the infant is developme ntally ready, breast milk or iron -fortified formula necessary for op timum growth is displaced (1, 25). Around 6 months of age, the infant is developmentally ready for solid foods when : the infant is better able to express certain feeding 0 5/2017 3 of 11 411 Dietary: Inappropriate Nutrition Practices for Infants cues such as turning head to indicate satiation; oral and gross motor skills begin to develop that help the infant to take solid foods; the extrusion reflex disappears; and the infant begins to sit upright and maintain balance with little or no support (1, 6, 24, 25). The AAP advises against giving fruit juice to infants younger than 6 months since it offers no nutritional benefit at this age (1). Offering juice before solid foods are introduced into the diet could risk having juice replace breast milk or infant formula i n the diet (15 ). This can result in reduced intake of protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals suc h as iron, calcium, and zinc (26). It is prudent to give juice only to infants who c an drink from a cup (15 ). 411.4 Routinely using feeding practices that disregard the developmental needs or stage of the infant. Infants held to rigid feeding schedules are often underfed or overfed. Caregivers insensitive to signs of hunger and satiety, or who over -manage feeding may inappropriately restrict or encourage excessive intake. Findings show that these practices may promote negative or unpleasant associations with eating that may continue into later life, and may also contribute to obesity. Infrequent breastfeeding can result in lactation insufficiency and infant failure -to-thrive. Infants should be fed foods with a texture appropriate to their developmental level. (4 , 6, 11, 13, 23) 411.5 Feeding foods to an infant that could be contaminated with harmful microorganisms or toxins. Only pasteurized juice is safe for infant s, children, and adolescents (15 ). Pasteurized fruit juice s are free of microorganisms (15 ). Unpasteurized juice may contain pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Cryptosporidium organisms (15 , 27). These organisms can caus e serious disease, such as hemolytic -uremic syndrome, and should never be fed to infants and children (15). Unpasteurized juice must contain a warning on the label that the product ma y contain harmful bacteria (15, 28). Infants or young children should not eat raw or unpasteurized milk or cheeses (1) \u2014unpasteurized dairy products could contain harmful bacteria, such as Brucella species, that could cause young children to contract a dangerous food borne illness. The AAP also recommends that young children should not eat soft cheeses such as feta, Brie, Camembert, blue -veined, and Mexican- style cheese\u2014 these foods could contain Listeria bacteria (1). Hard cheeses, processed cheeses, cream cheese, cottage cheese, and y ogurt need not be avoided (1). Honey has been implicated as the primary food source of Clostridium botulinum during infancy. These spores are extremely resistant to heat, including pasteurization, and are not destroyed by present methods of processing honey. Botulism in infancy is caused by ing estion of the spores, which germinate into the toxin in t he lumen of the bowel (10, 11 , 29, 30). Infants or young children should not eat raw or undercooked meat or poultry, raw fish or shellfish, including oysters, clams, mussels, and scallops \u2014 these food s may contain harmful bacteria or parasites that could cause children to contract a dangerous food -borne illness (1). According to the AAP, to prevent food -borne illness, the foods listed below should not be fed to infants or young children (1). All of t he foods have been implicated in selected outbreaks of food -borne illness, including in children. Background information regarding foods that could be contaminated with harmful microorganisms is also included below (1): Raw vegetable sprouts (alfalfa, cl over, bean, and radish) -- can cause potentially dangerous Salmonella and E. coli O157 infection. Sprouts grown under clean conditions in the home alsopresent a risk because bacteria may be present in the seed s. Cook sprouts to reduce the risk of illnes s significantly (31).05/2017 411 4 of 11 Dietary: Inappropriate Nutrition Practices for Infants Deli meats, hot dogs, and processed meats (avoid unless heated until steaming hot) -- These foods have been found to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes; if adequately cooked, this bacteria is destroyed. Please see section 411. 9 below under \"Human Milk\", for information related to the use of donor human milk acquired via the internet or directly from an individual. 411.6 Routinely feeding inappropriately diluted formula. Over -dilution can result in water intoxication resulting in hyponatremia; irritability; coma; inadequate nutrient intake; failure to thri ve; and/or poor growth (1, 4, 6, 11, 32). Underdilution of formula increases calories, protein, and solutes presented to the kidney for excretion, and can result in hypernatre mia, tetany, and obesity (4 , 6, 11, 32). Dehydration and metabolic acidosis can occur with under -dilution of formula (4 , 6, 11, 32). Powdered formulas vary in density so manufacturers ' scoops are formula- specific to assure correct dilution (6). One clue for staff to identify incorrect formula preparation is to determine if the parent/caregiver is using the correct manufacturer's scoop to prepare the formula. 411.7 Routinely limiting the frequency of nursing of the exclusiv ely breastfed infant when human milk is the sole source of nutrients . Exclusive breastfeeding provides ideal nutrition to an infant and is sufficient to support optimal growth and development in the first 6 months of life (5 ). Human colostrum and milk have been studied extensively. They are composed of a mixture of nutritive components and other bioactive factors that are easy to digest and absorb and have strong physiologic effects upon the infant, and their composition changes over time to meet the infant's changing nutritional needs (1). Frequent breastfeeding is critical to the establishment and maintenance of an adequate milk supply for the infant (5 , 33-37). Inadequate frequency of breastfeeding may lead to lactation failure in the mother and dehydration, poor weight gain, diarrhe a, vomiting, illness, and malnourishment in the infant (5, 35, 38- 43). Exclusive breastfeeding protects infants from early exposure to contaminated foods and liquids (41 ). Infants who receive human milk more than infant formulas have a lower risk of bein g overweight in childhood and adolescence (44, 45 ). In addition, a summary report of several primary studies and meta - analyses has reported that a history of breastfeeding is associated with a reduction in the risk of otitis media, gastroenteritis, hospita lization for lower respiratory tract infections, atopic dermatitis, sudden infant death syndrome, childhood asthma, childhood leukemia, and type 1 and 2 diabetes (46). 411.8 Routinely feeding a diet very low in calories and/or essential nutrients. Highly r estrictive diets prevent adequate intake of nutrients, interfere with growth and development, and may lead to other ad verse physiological effects (4). Infants older than 6 months are potentially at the greatest risk for overt deficiency states related to inappropriate restrictions of the diet, although deficiencies of vitamins B12 and essential fatty acids may appear earlier (1, 47, 48). Infants are particularly vulnerable during the weaning period if fed a macrobiotic diet and may experience psychomotor delay in some instances (1, 49, 50). Well -balanced vegetarian diets with dairy products and eggs are generally associated with good health. However, strict vegan diets may be inadequate in calories, vitamin B12, vitamin D, calcium, iron, protein and essential amino acids neede d for growth and development (51 ). The more limited the diet, the greater the health risk. Given the health and nutrition risks associated with 05/2017 5 of 11 411 Dietary: Inappropriate Nutrition Practices for Infants highly restrictive diets, WIC can help the parent to assure that the infant consumes an adequate diet to optimize health during critical periods of growth as well as for the long term. 411.9 Routinely using inappropriate sanitation in the feeding, preparation, handling, and /or storage of expressed human milk or formula. Lack of sanitation in the preparation, handling and storage of expressed human milk or formula may cause gastrointestinal infection. The water used to prepare concentrated or powdered infant formula and prepare bottles and nipples (for formula and human milk) must be safe for consumption. Water contaminated with toxic substances ( such as nitrates , lead, or pesticides) poses a hazard to an infant's health and should NOT be used (10 ). In addition, a heat source is necessary to sterilize bottles and other items used in the st orage of both human milk and formu la. Adequate refrigeration (40 Degrees Fahrenheit or below) is necessary to safely store human milk and prepared formula (10). Human Milk Published guidelines on the handling and storage of human milk may differ among pediatric nutrition authorities ( 1, 10, 52-55). However, the following human milk feeding, handling, and storage practices are considered inappropriate and unsafe (10, 52, 56-59): Thawing frozen h uman milk in the microwave oven . Refreezing human milk . Adding freshly expressed unrefrigerated human milk to already frozen milk in a storage container . Feeding previously frozen human milk thawed in the refrigerator that has been refrigerated fo r more than 24 hours. Saving human milk from a used bottle for use at a subsequent feeding . Failure to clean a breast pump per manufacturer' s instruction . Feeding donor human milk acquired directly from individuals or the internet. Another consideration when recommending length of storage time is its effect on protective properties in human milk. There is evidence that after 48 hours of refrigeration, human milk significantly loses important antibacterial and antioxidant properties ( 60). These properties of human milk are specifically important for t he pre vention of necrotizing enterocolitis , retinopathy, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia of premature infants ( 5). Although some properties may be reduced with longer refrigerated storage, this does not diminish the overall superiority of human milk over formul a, as formula does not contain these protective properties or many of the other benefits of human milk . Participant circumstances (e.g., adequate refrigeration, safe water, heat source), the health of the infant and health care provider directions need to be considered when recommending the length of time human milk should be stored . If the breastfeeding mother uses a breast pump , it is essential for her to fully u nderstand the importance of the specific manufacturer's instructions for cleaning the breast pump. Improper cleaning of breast pumps and pump parts can increase the risk of expressed human milk contamination (58). With increased awareness of the benefits and efforts to promote breastfeeding, more mothers are choosing to breastfeed, as e videnced by data from CDC in the Breastfeeding Report Card (61). But in situations such as illness, physical inability to produce human milk, decisions to not breastfeed, or adoptive 05/2017 411 6 of 11 Dietary: Inappropriate Nutrition Practices for Infants parents seeking human milk, the desire to provide human milk may prompt parents/caregivers to turn to alternate methods of obtaining human milk to feed their infant. Since the cost of banked human milk can be prohibitive for WIC clients, these mothers may turn to informal milk sharing from known sources such as friends or rel atives, or from unknown sources such as internet sites or other advertisements. A study that evaluated human milk shared via the internet concluded that there was a high overall rate of bacterial growth and contamination, which suggests poor collection, storage, and shipping practices ( 62). In another study, researchers looked at current and past infection among potential donors to a human milk bank . It was revealed that a minimum of 3% of potential donors had positive serology for disease conditions such as syphilis, HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HTLV- 1 or HTLV -2 (63). It was concluded that if these relatively low risk potential donors tested positive then the untested or unscreened women of donor human milk may present a significant health risk ( 63). Although sharing human milk between those with an excess milk supply and those seeking milk for their infant may be growing in popularity (often facilitated by web sites established to link providers and recipients), both the AAP and the Food and Drug Adm inistration (FDA) recommend against feeding infants human milk obtained directly from individuals or through the internet ( 59, 64). Obtaining donor human milk via these means is discouraged due to the lack of adequate screening for infectious diseases and the risk of contamination (59). The FDA suggests that a decision to give donor human milk should be made in consultation with the infant's health care provider and only screened donor human milk should be used. Also, caregivers should consult with the in fant's health care provider on where to obtain sc reened donor human milk ( 59). Due to the lack of Federal guidelines and standards pertaining to the operation, quality, and safety of human milk banks and potential liability concerns, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service does not authorize banked human milk as an allowable substitute for WIC -eligible formulas (see WIC Policy Memorandum 2000 -2: Use of Banked Human Breast Milk in the WIC Program). Formula Formula must be properly prepar ed in a sanitary manner to be safe for consumption. Further more, prepared infant formula is a perishable food, and must be handled and stored properly in order to be sa fe for consumption (4 , 10). Most babies who are hospitalized for vomiting and diarrhea are bottle fed. This has often been attributed to the improper handling of formula rather than sensitivities to the formula . In rare cases, the contaminated powdered formulas may cause infections in preterm or immune compromised infants. To reduce the risk of infection in infants it is important that formulas be carefully prepared and handled. All formula should be prepared according to the manufacturer's instruction on the label, or those given by the health care provider . Manufacturers' instructions vary , depending on the product, in the length of time it is considered safe to store prepared infant formula without refrigeration before bacterial growth accelerates to an extent that the infant is placed at risk ( 1). Published guidelines on the handling and storage of infant formula indicate that it is unsafe to use prepared formula which (1): Has been held at room temperature longer than 1 hour or longer than recommended by the manufacturer . 0 5/2017 7 of 11 411 Dietary: Inappropriate Nutrition Practices for Infants Has been held in the refrigerator longer than the safe storage time indicated by the manufacturer . Remains in a bottle one hour af ter the start of feeding . Remains in a bottle from an earlier feeding . Is fed using improperly cleaned baby bottles . 411.10 Feeding dietary supplements with potentially harmful consequences. An infant consuming inappropriate or excessive amounts of single or multivitamin or mineral or herbal remedy not prescribed by a physician is at risk for a variety of adverse effects including harmful nutrient interactions, to xicity, and teratogenicity ( 1, 65). While some herbal teas may be safe, some have undesirable effects, particularly on infants who are fed herbal teas or who receive breast milk from mothers who have ingested herbal teas (66 ). Examples of teas with potentially harmful effects to infants and children include : licorice, comfrey leaves, oleander, m at\u00e9, kola nut or gotu cola, and chamomile (66- 68). Like drugs, herbal or botanical preparations have chemical and biological activity, may have side effects, and may interact with certa in medications --these interactions can cause problems and can even be dangerou s (69 ). Botanical supplements are not necessarily safe because the safety of a botanical depends on many things, such as its chemical makeup, how it works in the body, how it is prepared, and the dose used (69 ). 411.11 Routinely not providing dietary supplements recognized as essential by national public health policy when an infant's diet alone cannot meet nutrient requirements. Depending on an infant's specific needs and environmental circumstances, certain dietary supplements may be recommended by the infant's health care provider to ensure health. For example, fluoride supplements may be of benefit in reducing dental decay for children living in fluoride -deficient areas (1, 70). To prevent rickets and vitamin D deficiency in healthy infants and children, the AAP recommends a supplement of 400 IU per day for the following (5 ,71): All breastfed and partially breastfed infants unless they are weaned to at least 1 liter (or 1 quart ) pe r day of vitamin D -fortified formula. All nonbreastfed infants who are ingesting less than 1 liter (or 1 quart) per day of vitamin D - fortified formula. References 1. Committee on Nutrition, American Academy of Pediatrics .

Goat's milk, sheep's milk, imitation and substitute milks (that are unfortified or inadequately fortified) do not contain nutrients in amounts appropriate as a primary milk source for children (1 -4). Non-fat and reduced- fat milks are not recommended for use with children from 1 to 2 years of age because of the lower calorie density compared with whole- fat products (1, 5). The low -calorie, low -fat content of these milks requires an increase in caloric intake to meet energy needs . Infants and children under two using reduced fat milks gain at a slower growth rate, lose body fat as evidenced by skinfold thickness, lose energy reserves, and are at risk of inadequate intake of essential fatty acids. Additionally, essential fatty acids are a critical compone nt of infant and child brain development with deficits early in life leading to significantly altered brain structure and function (6 -8). Similar malnourishment ha s been associated with negative health outcomes including, but not limited to, slower langua ge development, poorer motor function, lower IQ, poorer school performance, and eyesight problems (9). WIC Regulations [7 CFR 246.10(e)] , however, include the option for WIC State agencies to issue reduced -fat milk and/or reduc ed-fat yogurt to children (1 to 2 years of age) for whom overweight or obesity is a concern , as determined by the Competent Professional Authority (CPA) ( Food Package Guidance, May 2014) . This option is consistent with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommendation in the clinical report: Lipid Screening and Cardiovascular Health in Childhood ( 10). The AAP identifies parental history of obesity, lipidemia , and cardiovascular disease as determinants for a child for whom overweight or obesity is a concern. WIC State agencies that choose to authorize reduced -fat milk and/or reduced -fat yogurt for the 1 year old child must develop policy that defines the assessment criteria the CPA will use to determine if the child should be given reduced- fat dairy products. For example, a State agency may choose to use existing nutrition risk criteria: #114 Overweight or At Risk of Overweight (Infants and Children) and/or # 115 High Weight -for-Length (Infants and Children <24 Months of Age) to identify children to receive reduced -fat milk. For more information about the required State agency policy for issuing reduced- fat milk to children 12 months to 2 years of age, please see the Food and Nutrition Service, Food Package Guidance issued May 2014. 425.2 Routinely feeding a child any sugar- containing fluids. Abundant epidemiologic evidence from groups who have consumed low quantities of sugar as well as from those who have consumed high quantities shows that sugar - especially sucrose - is the major dietary factor affecting the prevalence and progression of dental caries (11). Consumption of foods and beverages high in fermentable carbohydrates, such as sucrose, increases the risk of early chi ldhood caries and tooth decay (1 1, 12). 425.3 Routinely using nursing bottles, cups, or pacifiers improperly. Dental caries are a major health problem in U.S. preschool children, especia lly in low -income populations (13). Most implicated in this rampant disease process is prolonged use of baby bottles , during the day or 05/2017 425 2 of 7 Dietary: Inappropriate Nutrition Practices for Children night, containing fermentable sugars, (e.g., fruit juice, soda, and other sweetened drinks) ; pacifiers dipped in sweet agents such as sugar, honey or syrups ; or other high frequency sug ar exposures (1 1). Solid foods such as cer eal should not be put into a bottle for feeding; this is a form of force feeding (1 4) and does not encourage the child to eat the cereal in a more developmentally -appropriate way. Additional justifications for the examples include: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Academy of Pedodontics recommend that children not be put to bed with a bottle in their mouth (1 5, 16). While sleeping with a bottle in his or her mouth, a child's swallowing and salivary flow decrease, resulting in a poolin g of liquid around the teeth (1 7). Propping the bottle can cause : ear infections because of fluid entering the middle ear and not draining properly; choking from liquid flowing into the lungs; and tooth decay from prolonged exposure to car bohydrate -containing liquids (18 ). Pediatric dentists recommend that parents be encouraged to have infants drink from a cup as theyapproach their first birthday, and that infants are weaned from the bottle by 12 -14 months of age (19). The practice of allowing chil dren to carry or drink from a bottle or cup of juice for periods throughout the day leads to excessive exposure of the teeth to carbohydrate s, which promotes the development of dental caries (1 5). Allowing toddlers to use a bottle or cup containing fermen table carbohydrates unsupervised during waking hours provides an almost constant supply ofcarbohydrates and sugars (1) . This leads to rapid demineralization of tooth enamel and an increase in the risk of dental caries due to prolonged contact between car iogenic bacteria on the susceptible tooth surface and the sugars in the consumed liquid (1, 1 9). The sugars in the liquid pool around the child's teeth and gums feed the bacteria there and result in decay (20). The process may start before the teeth are even fully erupted. Upper incisors (upper front teeth) areparticularly vulnerable; the lower incisors are generally protected by the tongue ( 20). The damage begins as white lesions and progresses to brown or black di scoloration typical of caries ( 20). When early childhood caries are severe, the decayed crowns may break off and the permanent teethdeveloping below may be damaged ( 20). Undiagnosed dental caries and other oral pain may contribute to feeding problems and failure to thrive in young children ( 20). Use of a bottle or cup, containing fermentable carbohydrates, without restriction is a risk because the more times a childconsumes solid or liquid food, the higher the caries risk (1) . Cariogenic snacks eaten between meals place the toddler most at risk for caries development; this includes the habit of continually sipping from cups (or bottles) containing cariogenic liquids (juice, milk , soda, or sweetened liquid) (20). If inappropriate use of the bottle persists the child is at risk of toothaches, costly dental treatment, loss of primary teeth, and developmental lags on eating and chewing . If this continues beyond the usual weaning period there is a r isk of decay to permanent teeth. 425.4 Routinely using feeding practices that disregard the dev elopmen tal needs or stage of the child. The interactions and communication between a caregiver and child during feeding and eating influence a child's ability to progress in eating skills and consume a nutritionally adequate diet . These interactions comp rise the \"feeding relationship\" (1 4). A dysfunctional feeding relationship, which could be characterized by a caregiver misinterpreting, ignoring, or overruling a young child's innate capability to regulate food intake based on hunger, appetite , and satie ty can result in poor dietary intake and impaired growth (2 1, 22). Parents who consistently attempt to control their children's food intake may give children few opportunities to learn to control their own food intake (2 3). This could result in inadequat e or 05/2017 3 o f 7 425 Dietary: Inappropriate Nutrition Practices for Children excessive food intake, future problems with food regulation, and problems with growth and nutritional status . Instead of using approaches such as bribery, rigid control, struggles, or short -order cooking to manage eating, a healthier approach is for parents to provide nutritious, safe foods at regular meals and snacks, allowing children to decide h ow much, if any, they eat (1, 2 2). Young children should be able to eat in a matter -of-fact way sufficient quantities of the foods that are given to them, just as they take care of other daily needs (3) . Research indicates that restricting access to foods (i.e., high fat foods) may enhance the interest of 3 - to 5-year old children in those foods and increase their desire to obtain and consume those foods . Stringent parental controls on child eating have been found to potentiate children's preference for high -fat energy dense foods, limit children's acceptance of a variety of foods, and disrupt children's re gulation of energy intake (2 4, 25). Forcing a child to clean his or her plate may lead to overeating or development of an aversion to certain foods (1 2). The toddler and preschooler a re striving to be independent (1 2). Self -feeding is important even though physically they may not be able to handle feeding utensils or have good eye -hand coordination ( 12). Children should be able to manage the feeding process independently and with dispatch, without either unnecessary dawdling or hurried eating (3, 1 7). Self-feeding milestones include (1) : During in fancy, older infants progress from semisolid foods to thicker and lumpier foods to soft pieces to finger -feeding table food ( 14). By 15 months, children can manage a cup, although not without some spilling . At 16 to 17 months of age, well -defined wrist r otation develops, permitting the transfer of food from the bowl to the child's mouth with less spilling. The ability to lift the elbow as the spoon is raised and to flex the wrist as the spoon reaches the mouth follows . At 18 to 24 months, they learn to tilt a cup by manipulation with the fingers . Despite these new skills, 2 -year -old children often prefer using their fingers to using the spoon. Preschool children learn to eat a wider variety of textures and kinds of food (3, 1 2). However, the foods offered should be modified so that the child can chew and swallow the food without difficulty (3). 425.5 Feeding foods to a child that could be contaminated with harmful microorganisms. According to the AAP, to prevent food -borne illness, the foods listed below should not be fed to young children or infants (1) . All of the foods have been implicated in selected outbreaks of food -borne illness, including in children . Background information regarding foods that could be contaminated with harmful microorgani sms is also included below: Unpasteurized fruit or vegetable juice - Only pasteurized juice is safe for infants, children, a nd a dolescents (1 5). Pasteurized fruit juices are free of microorganisms (1 5). Unpasteurized juice may contain pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Cryptosporidium organisms (15 , 26). These organisms can cause serious disease, such as hemolytic -uremic syndrome, and shoul d ne ver be fed to infants and children (1 5). Unpasteurized juice must contain a warning on the label that the product may contain harmful bacteria (1 5, 27). Unpasteurized dairy products or soft cheeses - Young children or infants should not eat raw or unpasteurized milk or cheeses (1) . Unpasteurized dairy products could contain harmful bacteria, such as Brucella species, that could cause young children to contract a dangerous food borne illness . The AAP also recommends that young children should not eat soft cheeses such as feta, Brie, Camembert, blue- veined, and Mexican -style cheese . These foods c ould contain Listeria bacteria (hard cheeses, processed cheeses, cream cheese, cottage cheese, and yogurt need not beavoided) (1). Raw or undercooked meat, fish, poultry, or eggs - Young children or infants should not eat raw or undercooked meat or poult ry, raw fish or shellfish , including oysters, clams, mussels, and scallops05/2017 425 4 of 7 Dietary: Inappropriate Nutrition Practices for Children (1). T hese foods may contain harmful bacteria or parasites that could cause children to contract a dangerous food borne illness. Raw vegetable sprouts (alfalfa, clover, bean, and radish) - Sprouts can cause potentially dangerous Salmonella and E. coli O157 infection . Sprouts grown under clean conditions in the home also present a risk because bacteria may be present in the seed . Cook sprouts to significantly reduce the risk of il lness (2 8). Deli meats, hot dogs, and processed meats (avoid unless heated until steaming hot) - These foods have been found to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes ; if adequately cooked, this bacteria is destroyed. 425.6 Routinely feeding a diet v ery low in calories and/or essential nutrients. Highly restrictive diets prevent adequate intake of nutrients, interfere with growth and development, and may lead to other adverse physiological effects (29) . Well -balanced vegetarian diets with dairy products and eggs are generally associated with good health . However, strict vegan diets may be inadequate in calories, vitamin B12, vitamin D, calcium, iron, protein , and essential amino acids needed for growth and development ( 30). The more limited the diet, the greater the health risk . Given the health and nutrition risks associated with highly restrictive diets, WIC can help the parent to assure that the child consumes an adequate diet to optimize health during critical periods of growth as well as for th e long term. 425.7 Feeding dietary supplements with potentially harmful consequences. A child consuming inappropriate or excessive amounts of single or multivitamin or mineral or herbal remedy not prescribed by a physician is at risk for a variety of adverse effects including harmful nutrient interactions, toxicity, and teratogenicity (1, 31) . Like drugs, herbal or botanical preparations have chemical and biological activity, may have side effects, and may interact with certain medications - these intera ctions can cause problems and can even be dangerous ( 32). Botanical supplements are not necessarily safe because the safety of a botanical depends on many things, such as its chemical makeup, how it works in the body, how it is prepared, and the dose used (32) . While some herbal teas may be safe, some have undesirable effects, particularly on young children who are fed herbal teas or who receive breast milk from mothers who have ingested herbal teas ( 33). Examples of teas with potentially harmful effects to children include : licorice, comfrey leaves, er, yerba cola, and chamomile ( 33-35). 425.8 Routinely not providing dietary supplements recognized as essential by national public health policy when a child's diet alone cannot meet nutrient requirements. Depending on a child's specific needs and environmental circumstances, certain dietary supplements may be recommended by the child's health care provider to ensure health. For example, fluoride supplements may be of benefit in reducing dental decay for children living in fluoride -deficient areas (1, 3 6). In addition, the AAP recommends that children who are ingesting less than 1 liter (1 quart) per day of vitamin D - fortified formula or milk should receive a vitami n D supplement of 400 IU/day (3 7). Since 1 quart of milk is in excess of the recommended 2 cups of milk per day for pre -school children (38 ), most children will require a vitamin D supplement . 0 5/2017 5 of 7 425 Dietary: Inappropriate Nutrition Practices for Children 425.9 Routine ingestion b y child o f nonfood i tems ( Pica) .

Pica has also be en seen in children with obsessive- compulsive disorders, mental disability, and sickle cell disease (39-41). Complications of this disorder include : iron-deficiency anemia, lead poisoning, i ntestinal obstruction, acute toxicity from soil contaminants, and helminthic i nfestations (39, 42, 43).

Women taking inappropriate or excessive amounts of dietary supplements, such as single or multivitamins or minerals, or botanical (including herbal) remedies or teas, are at risk for adverse effects such as harmful nutrient interactions, toxicity and teratogenicity (1, 2). Pregnant and lactating women are at higher risk secondary to the potential transference of harmful substances to their infant. Most nutrient toxicities occur through excessive supplementation of particular nutrients, such as, vitamins A, B-6 and niacin, iron and selenium (3). Large doses of vitamin A may be teratogenic (4). Because of this risk, the Institute of Medicine recommends avoiding preformed vitamin A supplementation during the first trimester of pregnancy (4). Besides nutrient toxicities, nutrient-nutrient and drug-nutrient interactions may adversely affect health. Many herbal and botanical remedies have cultural implications and are related to beliefs about pregnancy and breastfeeding. The incidence of herbal use in pregnancy ranges from 7-55 % with echinacea and ginger being the most common (1). Some botanical (including herbal) teas may be safe; however, others have undesirable effects during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Herbal supplements such as, blue cohash and pennyroyal stimulate uterine contractions, which may increase the risk of miscarriage or premature labor (1, 5). The March of Dimes and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend cautious use of tea mixtures because of the lack of safety testing in pregnant women (6). 427.2 Consuming a diet very low in calories and/or essential nutrients; or impaired caloric intake or absorption of essential nutrients following bariatric surgery. Women consuming highly restrictive diets are at risk for primary nutrient deficiencies, especially during critical developmental periods such as pregnancy. Pregnant women who restrict their diets may increase the risk of birth defects, suboptimal fetal development and chronic health problems in their children. Examples of nutrients associated with negative health outcomes are: Low iron intake and maternal anemia and increased risk of preterm birth or low birth weight (7, 8). Low maternal vitamin D status and depressed infant vitamin D status (9). Low folic acid and NTD (10, 11, 12). Low calorie intake during pregnancy may lead to inadequate prenatal weight gain, which is associated with infant intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) (13) and birth defects (10, 11, 14). The pregnant adolescent who restricts her diet is of particular concern since her additional growth needs compete with the developing fetus and the physiological changes of pregnancy (14). Strict vegan diets may be highly restrictive and result in nutrient deficiencies. Nutrients of potential concern that may require supplementation are: Riboflavin (15, 16) Iron (15) 07/2009 427 2 of 7 Dietary: Inappropriate Nutrition Practices for Women Zinc (15, 17) Vitamin B12 (15, 16, 18) Vitamin D (15, 16, 18) Calcium (15, 16, 18, 19,) Selenium (16) The pregnant adolescent who consumes a vegan diet is at even greater risk due to her higher nutritional needs (16, 18). The breastfeeding woman who chooses a vegan or macrobiotic diet increases her risk and her baby's risk for vitamin B12 deficiency (18) . Severe vitamin B12 deficiency resulting in neurological damage has been reported in infants of vegetarian mothers (18). With the epidemic of obesity, treatment by gastric bypass surgery has increased more than 600% in the last ten years and has created nutritional deficiencies not typically seen in obstetric or pediatric medical practices (20). Gastrointestinal surgery promotes weight loss by restricting food intake and, in some operations, interrupting the digestive process. Operations that only reduce stomach size are known as \"restrictive operations\" because they restrict the amount of food the stomach can hold. Examples of restrictive operations are adjustable gastric banding and vertical banded gastroplasty. These types of operations do not interfere with the normal digestive process (21). Some operations combine stomach restriction with a partial bypass of the small intestine; these are known as malabsorptive operations. Examples of malabsorptive operations are Roux- en-y gastric bypass (RGB) and Biliopancreatic diversion (BPD). Malabsorptive operations carry a greater risk for nutritional deficiencies because the procedure causes food to bypass the duodenum and jejunum, where most of the iron and calcium are absorbed. Menstruating women may develop anemia because not enough iron and vitamin B12 are absorbed. Decreased absorption of calcium may also contribute to osteoporosis and metabolic bone disease (21). A breastfeeding woman who has had gastric bypass surgery is at risk of vitamin B12 deficiency for herself and her infant (22). 427.3 Compulsively ingesting non-food items (pica). Pica, the compulsive ingestion of non-food substances over a sustained period of time, is linked to lead poisoning and exposure to other toxicants, anemia, excess calories or displacement of nutrients, gastric and small bowel obstruction, as well as, parasitic infection (23). It may also contribute to nutrient deficiencies by either inhibiting absorption or displacing nutrient dense foods in the diet. Poor pregnancy outcomes associated with pica-induced lead poisoning, include lower maternal hemoglobin level at delivery (24) and a smaller head circumference in the infant (25). Maternal transfer of lead via breastfeeding has been documented in infants and can result in a neuro-developmental insult depending on the blood lead level and the compounded exposure for the infant during pregnancy and breastfeeding (26, 27, 28). 427.4 Inadequate vitamin/mineral supplementation recognized as essential by national public health policy. The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for pregnant women is 27mg of iron per day (29). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends iron supplementation for all pregnant women to prevent iron deficiency (30); however, pregnant women should seek guidance from a qualified health care provider before taking dietary supplements (31). 07/2009 3 of 7 427 Dietary: Inappropriate Nutrition Practices for Women During pregnancy and lactation the iodine requirement is sharply elevated. The RDA for iodine during pregnancy is 220 g and 290 g during lactation (29). Severe iodine deficiency during pregnancy can cause congenital iodine deficiency syndrome and adversely affect cognitive development in children (32). Even mild iodine deficiency may have adverse affects on the cognitive function of children (33). Since the 1970s, according to the 2001-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES), there has been a decrease of approximately 50% in adult urinary iodine values. For women of child bearing age, the median urinary iodine value decreased from 294 to 128 g per liter (34). The American Thyroid Association recommends that women receive prenatal vitamins containing 150 g of iodine daily during pregnancy and lactation (35). The iodine content of prenatal vitamins in the Unites States is not mandated, thus not all prenatal vitamins contain iodine (36). Pregnant and breastfeeding women should be advised to review the iodine content of their vitamins and discuss the adequacy of the iodine with their health care provider. Non-pregnan t women of childbearing age who do not consume adequate amounts of folic acid are at greate r risk for function al folate deficiency, which has been proven to cause neural tube defects (NTDs), such as spina bifid a and anencephaly (37-40). Folic a cid consumed from fortified foods and/or a vitamin supplemen t in addition to folate found naturally in food reduces this risk (12) . The terms \"folic acid\" and \"folate\" are used interchangeably, yet they have differen t meanings . Folic acid is the synthetic form used in vitamin supplements and fortified foods (12, 38, 39). Folate occurs natura lly and is found in foods, such as dark gree n leafy vegetables, strawberries, and orange juice (12). Studies show that consumin g 400 mcg of folic acid daily interconceptionally can preven t 50 percen t of neural tube defects (12). Because NTDs develop early in pregnancy (between the 17th and 30th day) and many pregnancies are not planned, it is importan t to have adequate intakes before pregnancy and throughou t the childbearing years (14). NTDs often occur before women know they are pregnant . It is recommended that all women capable of becoming pregnan t consume a multivitamin containing 400 mcg of folic a cid daily (39-41). It is importan t that breastfeeding and non-breastfeedin g women participating in the WIC Program know about folic acid and foods that contain folate to encourage preconceptional preventive practices (38). 427.5 Pregnan t woman ingesting foods th at could be contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms. Food-borne illness is a serious public health problem (42). The causes include pathogen ic microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, and parasites) and their toxins and chemical contamination . The symp toms are usually gastrointestin al in nature (vomitin g, diarrhea, and abdomin al pain ), but neuro logical and \"non-specific\" symptoms may occur as well . Ove r the last 20 years, certa in foods have been linked to outbreaks of food- borne illness. These foods include: m ilk (Campylobacter); shellfish (Norwalk-like viruses); unpasteurized apple cider eggs (Salmonella); fish (ciguatera raspberries called listeriosis . Listeriosis during pregnancy can result in premature delivery, miscarriage, fetal death, and severe illness or death of a newborn from the infection (43). Listeriosis can be transmitted to the fetus through the placenta even if the mother is not showing signs of illness. Pregnan t women are especially at ris k for food-borne illness. For this reason, governmen t agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service, and the Food and Drug Administration advise pregnan t women and other high ris k individuals not to eat foods as identified in the definition for this criterion (42, 43). 07/2009 427 4 of 7 Dietary: Inappropriate Nutrition Practices for Women The CDC encourages health care professionals to provide anticipatory guidance, including the \"four simple steps to food safety\" of the Fight BAC campaign, to help reduce the incidence of food -borne illnesses.

A complete nutrition assessment, including for risk #411, Inappropriate Nutrition Practices for Infants, or #425, Inappropriate Nutrition Practices for Children, must be completed prior to assigning this risk . Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Infants 4 to 12 months IV Children 12 through 23 months V Justification Overview Complementary feeding is the gradual addition of foods and beverages to the diet of the infant and young child (1, 2). The process of adding complementary foods should reflect the physical, intellectual, and behavioral stages as well as the nutrient needs of the infant or child. Inappropriate complementary feeding practices are common and well documented in the literature. Caregivers often do not recognize signs of developmental readiness and , therefore, offer foods and beverages that may be inappropriate in type, amount, consistency, or texture. Furthermore, a lack of nationally accepted feeding guidelines for childre n under the age of two might lead caregivers to assume that all foods are suitable for this age range. The 2000 WIC Participant and Program Characteristics study (PC 2000) shows greater percentages of anthropometric and biochemical risk factors in children ages 6 to 24 months than in children 24 to 60 months of age (3). These differences could reflect physical manifestations of inappropriate complementary feeding practices. Although PC 2000 shows a lower dietary risk in the 6 to 24 month age group, this risk is probably under-reported due to the high incidence of other higher priority nutrition risks. 03/2005 428 2 of 7 Dietary: Dietary Risk Associated with Complementary Feedi ng Practices Age Anthropometric Risk (%) Biochemical Risk (%) Dietary Risk (%) 6-11 mos 40 16 55 1 yr 41 14 76 2 yrs 37 12 80 3 yrs 32 9 80 4 yrs 35 7 79 The Institute of Medicine (IOM), in their report, Summary of Proposed Criteria for Selecting the WIC Food Packages identified specific nutrients with potential for inadequacy or excess for WIC participants. For breast-fed infants 6 through 11 months, the nutrients of concern for potential inadequacy are iron and zinc while those for children 12 through 23 months are iron, vitamin E, fiber and potassium. The nutrients of concern for excessive intake in children 12 through 23 months are zinc, preformed vitamin A, sodium and energy (4). To manage complementary feeding successfully, caregivers must make decisions about what, when, where, and how to offer foods according to the infant's or child's: Requirement for energy and nutrients; Fine, gross, and oral motor skills; Emerging independence and desire to learn to self-feed; and Need to learn healthy eating habits through exposure to a variety of nutritious foods (1, 2, 5, 6, 7). How WIC Can Help The WIC Program plays a key role not only in the prevention of nutrition-related health problems, but also in the promotion of lifelong healthy eating behaviors. The process of introducing complementary foods provides a unique opportunity for WIC staff to assist caregivers in making appropriate feeding decisions for young children that may have lifelong implications. Prevention of Nutrition-Related Health Problems: Zinc deficiency Zinc is critical for growth and immunity, as well as brain development and function. The concentration of zinc in breast milk declines to a level considered inadequate to meet the needs of infants 7 to 12 months of age (8, 9). Complementary food sources of zinc, such as meats or zinc-fortified infant cereals, should be introduced to exclusively breastfed infants by 7 months. Iron deficiency Hallberg states, \"The weaning period in infants is especially critical because of the especially high iron requirements and the importance of adequate iron nutrition during this crucial period of development \" (10). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), children less than 24 months of age, especially those between 9 and 18 months, have the highest rate of iron deficiency of any age group (11). In the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), children ages 1 to 2, along 03/2005 3 of 7 428 Dietary: Dietary Risk Associated with Complementary Feeding Practices with adolescent girls, had the highest rates of overt anemia, while 9 % were iron deficient (12). Meanwhile, the Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance 2003 Report noted anemia rates of 16.2 % in 6 to 11 months of age infants, 15.0 % in 12 to 17 months of age, and 13.5 % in 18- 23 months of age children (13). Picciano et al. reported that the intake of iron decreased from 98% of the recommended amount at 12 months to 76% at 18 months of age (14). In WIC clinics, Kahn et al. found that the incidence of anemia was significantly more common in 6 to 23 months of age children than in 23 to 59 months of age. The 6 to 23 months of age was also more likely than the older child to develop anemia despite a normal hemoglobin test at WIC certification (15). Feeding practices that may prevent iron deficiency include: Breastfeeding infants exclusively until 4 to 6 months of age; Feeding only iron-fortified infant formula as a substitute for or supplement to breast milk until age 1; Offering a supplemental food source of iron to infants, between 4 to 6 months or when developmentally ready; Avoiding cow's milk until age 12 months; and Limiting milk consumption to no more than 24 ounces per day for children aged 1 to 5 years (11). Obesity Much of the literature on obesity indicates that learned behaviors and attitudes toward food consumption are major contributing factors. Proskitt states, \"The main long term effect of weaning on nutritional status could be through attitudes toward food and meals learned by infants through the weaning process. This may be a truly critical area for the impact of feeding on later obesity \" (16). Birch and Fisher state, \"An enormous amount of learning about food and eating occurs during the transition from the exclusive milk diet of infancy to the omnivore's diet consumed by early childhood. \" The authors believe that parents have the greatest influence on assuring eating behaviors that help to prevent future overweight and obesity ( 17). The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) states, \"...prevention of overweight is critical, because long -term outcome data for successful treatment approaches are limited...\" and, \"Families should be educated and empowered through anticipatory guidance to recognize the impact they have on their children's development through lifelong habits of physical activity and nutritious eating \" (1) . Parents can be reminded that they are role models and teachers who help their children adopt healthful eating and lifestyle practices. Tooth decay Children under the age of 2 are particularly susceptible to Early Childhood Caries (ECC), a serious public health problem (18). In some communities, the incidence of ECC can range from 20% to 50% (19). Children with ECC appear to be more susceptible to caries in permanent teeth at a later age (1, 20). Dental caries can be caused by many factors, including prolonged use of a bottle and extensive use of sweet and sticky foods (21). The Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood examined 1,026 children aged 18 months and found that baby bottles were used exclusively for drinking by 10 % of the children and for at least one 03/2005 428 4 of 7 Dietary: Dietary Risk Associated with Complementary Feedi ng Practices feeding by 64% of the children. Lower income families were found to use the bottle more frequently for carbonated beverages than higher income families (22). Complementary feeding practices that caregivers can use to prevent oral health problems include: Avoiding concentrated sweet foods like lollipops, candy and sweetened cereals. Avoiding sweetened beverages. Introducing fruit juice after 6 months of age (1) and only feeding it in a cup; and limiting fruit juice to 4-6 ounces/day. Weaning from a bottle to a cup by 12 to 14 months (23). Promotion of Lifelong Healthy Eating Behaviors: Timing of introduction of complementary foods The AAP, Committee on Nutrition (CON) states that, \"... complementary foods may be introduced between ages 4 and 6 months...\" but cautions that actual timing of introduction of complementary foods for an individual infant may differ from this (population based) recommendation. Furthermore, the AAP-CON acknowledges a difference of opinion with the AAP, Section on Breastfeeding, which recommends exclusive breastfeeding for at least 6 months (1). Early introduction of complementary foods before the infant is developmentally ready (i.e., before 4- 6 months of age) is associated with increased respiratory illness, allergy in high-risk infants, and decreased breast milk production (7). Infants with a strong family history of food allergy should be breastfed for as long as possible and should not receive complementary foods until 6 months of age. The introduction of the major food allergens such as eggs, milk, wheat, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, fish and shellfish should be delayed until well after the first year of life as guided by the health care provider (7, 24). Delayed introduction of complementary foods, on the other hand, is also associated with feeding difficulties. Northstone et al found that introduction of textured foods after 10 months of age resulted in more feeding difficulties later on, such as picky eating and/or refusal of many foods. To avoid these and other developmental problems, solid foods should be introduced no later than 7 months, and finger foods between 7 and 9 months of age (25). Choosing Appropriate Complementary Foods and Beverages Complementary foods should supply essential nutrients and be developmentally appropriate (7). The WIC Infant Feeding Practices Study (WIC-IFPS) found that by 6 months of age, greater than 80% of mothers introduced inappropriate dairy foods (i.e., yogurt, cheese, ice cream and pudding), 60% introduced sweets/snack foods (defined as chips, pretzels, candy, cookies, jam and honey), and 90% introduced high protein foods (beans, eggs and peanut butter) to their infants. This study also found that, among the infants who received supplemental drinks by 5 months of age, three-quarters had never used a cup, concluding that most infants received supplemental drinks from the bottle. By one year of age, almost 90% of WIC infants received sweetened beverages and over 90% received sweet/snack foods (26). The Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study (FITS) found that WIC infants and toddlers consumed excess energy but inadequate amounts of fruits and vegetables. In addition, WIC toddlers consumed more sweets, desserts and sweetened beverages than non-WIC toddlers (27). Sixty-five percent of all food-related choking deaths occur in children under the age of 2. Children in this age group have not fully developed their oral-motor skills for chewing and swallowing. For this reason, they 03/2005 5 of 7 428 Dietary: Dietary Risk Associated with Complementary Feeding Practices should be fed foods of an appropriate consistency, size, and shape. Foods commonly implicated in choking include hot dogs, hard, gooey or sticky candy, nuts and seeds, chewing gum, grapes, raisins, popcorn, peanut butter and hard pieces of raw fruits and vegetables and chunks of meat or cheese (1, 28, 29). Introducing a C up Teaching an infant to drink from a cup is part of the process of acquiring independent eating skills. A delay in the initiation of cup drinking prolongs the use of the nursing bottle that can lead to excess milk and juice intake and possible Early Childhood Caries (ECC). Weaning from a bottle to a cup should occur by 12 to14 months of age (23). Helping The Child Establish Lifelong Healthy Eating Patterns Lifelong eating practices may have their roots in the early years. Birch and Fisher state that food exposure and accessibility, the modeling behavior of parents and siblings, and the level of parental control over food consumption influence a child's food preferences . Inappropriate feeding practices may result in under- or over-feeding and may promote negative associations with eating that continue into later life. Normal eating behaviors such as spitting out or gagging on unfamiliar food or food with texture are often misinterpreted as dislikes or intolerances leading to a diminished variety of foods offered. Infants have an innate preference for sweet and salty tastes. Without guidance, an infant may develop a lifelong preference for highly sweetened or salty foods rather than for a varied diet (17). A young child gradually moves from the limited infant/toddler diet to daily multiple servings from each of the basic food groups as described in the Dietary Guidelin es (30). The toddler stage (ages 1-2 years) may frustrate caregivers since many toddlers have constantly changing food preferences and erratic appetites. In addition, toddlers become skeptical about new foods and may need to experience a food 15-20 times before accepting it (31). Caregivers can be guided and supported in managing common toddler feeding problems. Feeding practices that caregivers can use to facilitate a successful transition to a food group-based diet include: Offering a variety of developmentally appropriate nutritious foods; Reducing exposure to foods and beverages containing high levels of salt and sugar ; Preparing meals that are pleasing to the eye and include a variety of colors and textures; setting a good example by eating a variety of foods; Offering only whole milk from age 1-2; (Lower fat milk can be introduced after that age.) Providing structure by scheduling regular meal and snack times; Allowing the child to decide how much or whether to eat; Allowing the child to develop eating/self-feeding skills; and Eating with the child in a pleasant mealtime environment without coercion.

The State must limit the use of regression as a nutrition risk criterion to one time following a certification period . Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Breastfeeding Women I, IV, or VII Non- Breastfeeding Women III, IV, V, VI, or VII Infants I, IV, or VII Children III, V, or VII Justification On occasion, a participant's nutritional status may be improved, to the point that s/he rises above the cutoff of the initial risk condition by the end of the certification period. This occurs most frequently with those conditions that contain specific cutoffs or thresholds, such as anemia or inappropriate growth. Removal of such individuals from the Program can result in a \"revolving -door\" situation where the individual's recently improved nutritional status deteriorates quickly, so that s/he then re -enters the Program at equal or greater nutrition risk status than before. Therefore, WIC Program regulations permit State agencies to certify previously certified individuals who do not demonstrate a current nutrition risk condition based on the possibility of their reverting to the prior existing risk condition if they do not continue to receive WIC benefits. This provision may be used only once following a certification period. Such applicants shall not be considered to be at nutrition risk based on the possibility of regression for consecutive certification periods. This policy is consistent wi th the preventive nature of the WIC Program, and enables State and local agencies to ensure that their previous efforts to improve a participant's nutrition status, as well as to provide referrals to other health care, social service, and/or public assista nce programs are not wasted. Applicants who are certified based on the possibility of regression should be placed either in the same priority for which they were certified in the previous certification period; a priority level lower than the priority level assigned in the previous certification period, consistent with WIC regulations 246.7(e)(4); or in priority VII, if the State agency uses that priority level. Competent Professional Authorities and other certifying staff should keep in mind that every nutr ition risk condition does not necessarily lead itself to the possibility of regression. For example, gestational diabetes or gingivitis of pregnancy are not conditions to which a new mother could regress, since they are directly associated with pregnancy, and the breastfeeding or non -breastfeeding women cannot regress to being pregnant if she is no longer receiving WIC benefits. 06/2018 501 2 of 2 Other Risks: Possibility of Regression References 1.

The VOC is valid through the end of the current certification period, even if the participant does not meet the receiving agency's nutritional risk, priority or income criteria, or the certification period extends beyond the receiving agency's certification period for that category, and shall be accepted as proof of eligibility for Program benefits. If the receiving agency is at maximum caseload, the transferring participant must be placed at the top of any waiting list and enrolled as soon as possible. (1, 2) This criterion would be used primarily when the VOC card/document does not reflect another (more specific) nutrition risk condition or if the participant was certified based on a nutrition risk condition not in use by the receiving State agency (1). Participant Category and Priority L evel Category Priority Pregnant Women N/A Breastfeeding Women N/A Infants N/A Children N/A Justification Local agencies must accept Verification of Certification (VOC) documents from participants. A person with a valid VOC document shall not be denied participation in the receiving State because the person does not meet that State's particular eligibility criteria. Once a WIC participant has been certified by a local agency, the service delivery area into which s/he moves is obligated to honor that co mmitment. (1, 2) Implications for WIC Nutrition Services Transferring participants should receive the food package offered in the receiving State agency according to their category and nutritional needs. The receiving agency should explain any differences in the authorized supplemental foods. Participants who are eligible to receive WIC formula (infant formula, exempt infant formula, or WIC- eligible nutritionals) in Food Package III must have one or more qualifying conditions, as determined by a health care professional licensed to write medical prescriptions under State law (1, 2).

Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Pregnant Women* IV *Up to 60 da ys certification Justification In some cases, State or local agencies may not have the essential equipment or staff onsite to perform the necessary bloodwork assessment for pregnant women. There has been some concern that the bloodwork data requirement could be an impediment to the enrollment of eligible pregnant women early in pregnancy. Early enrollment is an important WIC Program o bjective, as well as a legislative requirement. In response to these concerns, Congress amended the Child Nutrition Act in 1994 to allow State agencies to consider pregnant women who are income eligible for the WIC Program to be presumed to be nutritionall y at risk and thus eligible to participate in the Program. These women may be certified immediately upon application without the results of a nutrition risk evaluation. However, the nutrition risk evaluation must be completed no later than 60 days from t he date the pregnant woman is certified for participation. Ideally, States should complete the full nutrition risk assessment at certification or at the earliest possible date thereafter. This would allow the WIC staff to initiate appropriate counseling on nutrition and diet, as well as complete appropriate health care referrals, at the earliest opportunity. This information is also invaluable in developing an appropriate food package for the pregnant woman. References 1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Prenatal Nutrition Surveillance System User's Manual.Atlanta: CDC, 1994. 2. WIC Program Reg ulations; Sect. 246.7 (e)(1)(v ). Clarification While the nutrition risk assessment must be performed no later than 60 days after the pregnant woman is certi fied for participation, the hematological test for anemia is not required to be performed within the 60 day period, but rather within 90 days, unless the nutrition risk assessment performed does not identify a qualifying risk factor.

Justification A breastfed infant is dependent on the mother's milk as the primary source of nutrition. Special attention should therefore be given to the health and nutritional status of the mother (5). Lactation requires approximately 500 additional Kcal per day as w ell as increased protein, calcium, and other vitamins and minerals (3, 1). Inadequate maternal nutrition may result in decreased nutrient content of the milk (1). References 1. Institute of Medicine. Nutrition During Lactation.

This severe breast congestion causes the nipple-areola area to become flattened and tense, making it difficult for the baby to latch-on correctly. The result can be sore, damaged nipples and poor milk transfer during feeding attempts. This ultimately results in diminished milk supply. When the infant is unable to latch-on or nurse effectively, alternative methods of milk expression are necessary, such as using an electric breast pump. Recurrent plugged ducts A clogged duct is a temporary back-up of milk that occurs when one or more of the lobes of the breast do not drain well. This usually results from incomplete emptying of milk. Counseling on feeding frequency or method or advising against wearing an overly tight bra or clothing can assist. Mastitis Mastitis is a breast infection that causes a flu-like illness accompanied by an inflamed, painful area of the breast - putting both the health of the mother and successful breastfeeding at risk. The woman should be referred to her health care provider for antibiotic therapy. 05/2015 602 2 of 3 Other Risks: Breastfeeding Complications (Women) Flat or inverted nipples Infants may have difficulty latching-on correctly to nurse when nipples are flat or inverted. Appropriate interventions can improve nipple protractility and skilled help guiding a baby in proper breastfeeding technique can facilitate proper attachment. Cracked, bleeding or severely sore nipples Severe nipple pain, discomfort lasting throughout feedings, or pain persisting beyond one week postpartum is atypical and suggests the baby is not positioned correctly at the breast. Improper infant latch-on not only causes sore nipples, but impairs milk flow and leads to diminished milk supply and inadequate infant intake. There are several other causes of severe or persistent nipple pain, including Candida or staph infection. Referrals for lactation counseling and/or examination by the woman's health care provider are indicated. Age 40 years Older women (over 40) are more likely to experience fertility problems and perinatal risk factors that could impact the initiation of breastfeeding. Because involutional breast changes can begin in the late 30's, older mothers may have fewer functioning milk glands resulting in greater difficulty producing an abundant milk supply. Failure of milk to come in by 4 days postpartum Failure of milk to come in by 4 days postpartum may be a result of maternal illness or perinatal complications. This may place the infant at nutritional and/or medical risk, making temporary supplementation necessary until a normal breast milk supply is established. Tandem nursing (breastfeeding two siblings who are not twins) With tandem nursing the older baby may compete for nursing privileges, and care must be taken to assure that the younger baby has first access to the milk supply. The mother who chooses to tandem nurse will have increased nutritional requirements to assure her adequate milk production. References 1. Alexander JM, Grant AM, Campbell MJ.

The Main Trial Collaborative Group: Preparing for breastfeeding: treatment (Infants) 603 Breastfeeding Complications or Potential Complications (Infants) Definition/Cut-off Value A breastfed infant with any of the following complications or potential complications for breastfeeding. BF Complications (or Potential Complications) Jaundice Weak o r ineffective suck Difficulty latching onto mother's breast Inadequate stooling (for age, as determined by a physician or other health care professional), and/or less than 6 wet diapers per day Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Infants I Justification Jaundice Jaundice occurs when bilirubin accumulates in the blood because red blood cells break down too quickly, the liver does not process bilirubin as efficiently as it should, or intestinal excretion of bilirubin is impaired. The slight degree of jaundice observed in many healthy newborns is considered physiologic. Jaundice is considered pathologic if it appears before 24 hours, lasts longer than a week or two, reaches an abnormally high level, or results from a medical problem such as rapid destruction of red blood cells, excessive bruising, liver disease, or other illness. When jaundice occurs in an otherwise healthy breastfed infant, it is important to distinguish \"breastmilk jaundice\" from \"breastfeeding jaundice\" and determine the appropriate treatment. In the condition known as \"breastmilk jaundice,\" the onset of jaundice usually begins well after the infant has left the hospital, 5 to 10 days after birth, and can persist for weeks and even months. Early visits to the WIC clinic can help identify and refer these infants to their primary health care provider. Breastmilk jaundice is a normal physiologic phenomenon in the thriving breastfed baby and is due to a human milk factor that increases intestinal absorption of bilirubin. The stooling and voiding pattern is normal. If the bilirubin level approaches 18-20 mg%, the health care provider may choose to briefly interrupt breastfeeding for 24-36 hours which results in a dramatic decline in bilirubin level. Resumption of breastfeeding usually results in cessation of the rapid fall in serum bilirubin concentration, and in many cases a small increase may be observed, followed by the usual gradual decline to normal. 04/2001 603 2 of 3 Other Risks: Breastfeeding Complications (Infants) \"Breastfeeding jaundice\", is an exaggeration of physiologic jaundice, which usually peaks between 3 and 5 days of life, though it can persist longer. This type of jaundice is a common marker for inadequate breastfeeding. An infant with breastfeeding jaundice is underfed and displays the following symptoms: infrequent or ineffective breastfeeding; failure to gain appropriate weight; infrequent stooling with delayed appearance of yellow stools (i.e., prolonged passage of meconium); and scant dark urine with urate crystals. Improved nutrition usually results in a rapid decline in serum bilirubin concentration. Weak or ineffective suck A weak or ineffective suck may cause a baby to obtain inadequate milk with breastfeeding and result in a diminished milk supply and an underweight baby. Weak or ineffective suckling can be due to prematurity, low birth weight, a sleepy baby, or physical/medical problems such as heart disease, respiratory illness, or infection. Newborns who receive bottle feedings before beginning breastfeeding or who frequently use a pacifier may have trouble learning the proper tongue and jaw motions required for effective breastfeeding. Difficulty latching onto the mother's breast Difficulty latching onto the mother's breast may be due to flat or inverted nipples, breast engorgement, or incorrect positioning and breastfeeding technique. Early exposure to bottle feedings can predispose infants to \"nipple confusion\" or difficulties learning to attach to the breast correctly and effectively extract milk. A referral for lactation counseling should be made. Inadequate stooling and/or less than 6 wet diapers per day Inadequate stooling or less than 6 wet diapers are probable indicators that the breastfed infant is not receiving adequate milk. Not only is the baby at risk for failure to thrive, but the mother's milk is at risk for rapidly diminishing due to ineffective removal of milk. The breastfed infant with inadequate caloric intake must be identified early and the situation remedied promptly to avoid long-term consequences of dehydration or nutritional deprivation. Although failure to thrive can have many etiologies, the most common cause in the breastfed infant is insufficient milk intake as a result of infrequent or ineffective nursing. Inadequate breastfeeding can be due to infant difficulties with latching on or sustaining suckling, use of a nipple shield over the mother's nipple, impaired let down of milk, a non-demanding infant, excessive use of a pacifier, or numerous other breastfeeding problems. The literature regarding inadequate stooling varies widely in terms of quantification; this condition is best diagnosed by the pediatrician or other health care practitioner. References 1.

WIC participation during pregnancy is associated with improved pregnancy outcomes. An infant whose nutritional status has been adequately maintained through WIC services during gestation and early infancy may decline in nutritional status if without these services and return to a state of elevated risk for nutrition related health problems. Infants whose mother was at medical/nutritional risk during pregnancy, but did not receive those services, may also be thought of as a group at elevated risk for morbidity and mortality in the infant period (1, 2). WIC participation in infancy is associated with lower infant mortality, decreased anemia for infants and improvements in growth (head circumference, height and weight). Infants on WIC are more likely to consume iron-fortified formula and cereal and less likely to consume cow's milk before one year, thus lowering the risk of developing iron deficiency anemia (1, 2).

Participant Category and Priority Level Category Priority Pregnant Women IV or VII Breastfeeding Women IV or VII Non- Breastfeeding Women IV or VII Infants IV or VII Children V or VII Justification A primary caregiver's ability to make appropriate feeding decisions and prepare suitable food is crucial for the health and nutritio n of infants and young children. Infants and children depend entirely on caregivers for food, as well as to learn what, when, and how to eat. A responsive feeding relationship, in which 06/2018 902 Other Risks: Woman or Infant/Child of Primary Caregiver with Limited Ability 2 of 6c aregivers recognize infant/child cues and respond appropriately in a warm and nurturing environment , is critical for supporting healthy dietary habits, food preferences , and weight outcomes in ch ildren (1 ). Several situations that might impair the feeding abilit ies of a caregiver have been identified below as potential nutritional risks for infants and children. A pregnant or postpartum woman's ability to choose and prepare suitable foods for herself is vital for her own nutritional status and wellbeing . A variety of circumstances can impair a woman's ability to make diet - related decisions or prepare food and thus have been identified as possible nutritional risks for pregnant and postpartum women. Substance Use About 1 in 5 children in the US live with a t least one caregiver who has a substance use disorder (2 ). While little research has been conducted on the impact of parental substance misuse on infant/child feeding, much has been learned about the influence of substance misuse on overall parenting and caregiving abilities. Parental substance misuse is sometimes associated with the following , which can all potentially have a negative impact on infant/child feeding: Impaired parental behaviors - \"lower levels of parental involvement, limited or absent p arental monitoring, ineffective control of children's behavior, and poor discipline skills\" (2 ). Compromised caregiving relationship - Less sensitive and responsive to infant/child 's cues and needs (3, 4 ); and less warm, positive, nurturing, and emo tionally available (5 ). Reduced capacity to prioritize infant/child's needs (including feeding needs ) over need for substances (2, 4). Parental difficulty in c ontrolling emotions and anger (4). Reduced likelihood for infants/children to receive adequate medical and dental care (2 ). Chaotic , unpredictable home environment - higher rates of household financial instability, foo d a nd housing insecurity, inconsistent employment, domestic violence, and stress (2 ). Paren tal incarceration (2 ). Increased likelihood of inf ant/child entering foster care - about 60% of infants and 40% of childre n i n out -of-home care are from families with substance use disorders (2, 4 ). Increased risk of neglect and abuse - children of parents who misuse substances are 3 times a s li kely to be physically, emotionally, or sexually abused and 4 times as likely to be emotionally o r phys ically neglected (2). In addition to impacting infants/children, substance use can also impair a woman's ability to choose and prep are suitable foods for herself. People with substance use disorders tend to h ave impaired decision - making (6, 7), which can extend to diet -related choices. Also, as stated above, substance use can result in difficulty in controlling emotions and anger; a chaotic, unpredictable home envi ronment; and incarceration -all of which can negatively impact ability to choose and prepare foods. For additional information , please refer to R isk 372 - Alcohol and Substance Use . Mental Illness Mental illness refers to a wide range of mental health conditions- disorders that affect your mood, thinking and behavior. Examples of mental illness include depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders and addictive behaviors (8). Some caregivers with a mental illness can struggle with parenting, including the feeding of infants and young children (1, 9). Depression in particular has been studied for its impact on the caregiver -child feeding relationship. For mothers with depression, they may be less able to 06/2018 3 of 6 Other Risks: Woman or Infant/Child of Primary Caregiver with Limited Ability 902 detect and respond to an infant's needs, including feeding needs. Depressed mothers are also more likely to be withdrawn, disengaged, and non- interacting, all of which can negatively impact infant/child feeding. Maternal depression may also have a significant impact on breastfeeding dyads, as depression is linked to worrying more about breastfeeding and reportin g breastfeeding difficulties (10 ). In addition, mothers who are depressed tend to have decreased rates of breastfeeding in itiation, duration, and exclusivity, compared to m others who are not depressed (10 ). There is a scarcity of research on the impact of other forms of mental illness (other than depression) on the caregiver- infant/child feeding relationship. For additional information on depression, please refer to Risk 361 - Depression. Mental illness can be debilitating to pregnant and postpartum women in a variety of ways, which include impairing the ability to choose and prepare suitable foods. Some studies indicate that poor eating habits may be common among those with a mental illness (11, 12 ). For example, people with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia are more likely to report only eating once a day, eating alone, and having difficulty with preparing food (11 ). Individuals with a mental illness also may experience cognitive challenges, which can limit learning and retention of information about nutrition and food preparation. In addition, those with a mental illness may also have limited resources (due to not being able to work) for purchasing foods. Intellectual Disability Intellectual disability is a disability characterized by significant limitations in both intellectual functioning and in adaptive behavior, which covers many everyday soc ial and practical skills (13). A limited amount of research has been conducted on the impact of caregiver intellectual disability and infant/child feeding. Some research indicates caregivers with an intellectual disability may be less sensit ive to an infant/child's cues (14). Other research indicates some caregivers with an intellectual disability also struggle with interacting positively and demonstrating affection with their infant/child (15 ). Based on each individual's situation, these concerns co uld possibly impair a caregiver's ability to provide appropriate infant/child feeding. Having an intellectual disability , such as Down syndrome, may make it difficult or even impossible for women to choose, prepare, or serve themselves foods and beverages (16). As a result, some women with intellectual disabilities are at risk for developing diseases associated with obesity, inactivity, and poor nutrition and may have very little choice in deciding their dietary intake since it may be determined by a careg iver (17 ). Physical Disability Some physical disabilities have the potentia l to reduce a caregiver's ability to feed an infant/child appropria tely or prepare suitable foods. Likewise, some physical disabilities may limit a woman's ability to feed herself or prepare suitable foods for herself . This risk should be assigned if a caregiver's physical disability restricts or limits food preparation ability or ability to feed an infant/child. It should also be assigned if a woman's physical disability restrict s or limits her ability to prepare foods for herself or to feed herself. 17 Years of Age and Younger In 2015, about 230,000 infants were born to teenage mothers; this is a birthrate of about 22 per 1,000 teenage women (18). Teenage mothers may face several challenges as they raise infants and children, including their ability to interact in a responsive manner. Being a teenage mother is sometimes associated with the following, which can all potentially have a negative impact on infant/child feeding: 06/2018 902 Other Risks: Woman or Infant/Child of Primary Caregiver with Limited Ability 4 of 6 I ncreased likelihood of a c omprom ised caregiving relationship - Reduced verbal and emotional responsiveness to infant/child (19), reduced sensitivity to needs of infant (19), and impaired ability to provide cognitive stimulation to infant/child (20 ). Increased likelihood of infan t/child entering foster care (20 ). Greater likelihood to misuse substances (21). For additional information regarding pregnant and postpartum adolescents , please refer to Risk 331 - Pregnancy at a Young A ge. Implications for WIC Nutrition Services WIC provides support to wome n and to infants /children of caregivers with limited ability to make appropriate feeding decisions/prepare food by offering counseling on nutrition, breastfeeding, and infant/ child feeding. WIC also provides nutritious foods for women and caregivers to give their infants /children, as well as referrals to support participants' needs. WIC staff can assist participants by: Providing individualized nutrition education in an easy -to-understand format that is appropriate for the learning level of the participant/ caregiver. Most education materials should be written for a 5th to 7th grade reading level. Be sensitive to the unique learning needs and style of the participant/caregive r, which may mean using food models, posters, and handouts (12). Pro viding referrals to promote parenting and infant/child feeding skills, including referrals to local home visiting programs, parenting programs, and early i ntervention services . Pro viding referrals to those with substance misuse for professional treatment, referring to community resources for alcohol and substance use support groups, and providing breastfeeding promotion and support to women enrolled in supervised medication -assisted treatment programs . Encouraging participants/ caregivers with mental illnesses , intellectual disabilities, and physical disabilities to follow health care provider's plan of care . Coordinate with health care providers as needed. Providing individualize d food packages, tailored to meet the needs of participants. Some caregivers who have a limited ability to make appropriate feeding decisions/prepare food may be unable to p repare powder or concentrate d infant formula. Thus, for the safety of the infant, State WI C A gencies may allow ready -to-feed (RTF) WIC formulas to be issued when it is determined that the caregiver may have difficulty correctly diluting powder or concentrated formulas. Please refer to your State WIC Agency's specific policies regarding the issuance of RTF, as policies vary from state to state. References 1.

Clarification Self-reporting of a diagnosis by a medical professional should not be confused with self -diagnosis, where a person simply claims to have or to have had a medical condition without any reference to professional diagnosis. A self -reported medical diagnosis (\"My doctor says that I have/my son or daught er has...\") should prompt the CPA to validate the presence of the condition by asking more pointed questions related to that diagnosis. 04/2001 1 of 2 903 Other Risks : Foster Care 903 Foster Care Definition/Cut-off Value Entering the foster care system during the previous six months or moving from one foster care home to another foster care home during the previous six months. Participant Category and Priority L evel Category Priority Pregnant Women IV or VII Breastfeeding Women IV or VII Non -Breastfeeding Women VI or VII Infants IV or VII Children V or VII Justification \"Foster children are among the most vulnerable individuals in the welfare system. As a group, they are sicker than homeless children and children living in the poorest sections of inner cities.\" This statement from a 1995 Government Accounting Office report on the health status of foster children confirms research findings that foster children have a high frequency of mental and physical problems, often the result of abuse and neglect suffered prior to entry into the foster care system. When compared to other Medicaid- eligible children, foster care children have higher rates of chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes and seizure disorders. They are also more likely than children in the general population to have birth defects, inadequate nutrition and growth retardation including short stature. Studies focusing on the health of foster children often point out the inadequacy of the foster care system in evaluating the health status and providing follow-up care for the children for whom the system is responsible. Because foster care children are wards of a system which lacks a comprehensive health component, the social and medical histories of foster children in transition, either entering the system or moving from one foster care home to another, are frequently unknown to the adults applying for WIC benefits for the children. For example, the adult accompanying a foster child to a WIC clinic for a first-time certification may have no knowledge of the child's eating patterns, special dietary needs, chronic illnesses or other factors which would qualify the child for WIC. Without any anthropometric history, failure to grow, often a problem for foster children, may not be diagnosed even by a single low cutoff percentile. Since a high proportion of foster care children have suffered from neglect, abuse or abandonment and the health problems associated with these, entry into foster care or moving from one foster care home to another during the previous six months is a nutritional risk for certification in the WIC Program. Certifiers using this risk should be diligent in evaluating and documenting the health and nutritional status of the foster child to identify other risks as well as problems that may require follow-up or referral to other health care programs. This nutritional risk cannot be used for consecutive certifications while the child remains in the same foster home. It should be used as the sole risk criterion only if careful assessment of the 04/2001 903 2 of 2 Other Risks: Foster Care applicant's nutritional status indicates that no other risks based on anthropometric, medical or nutritional risk criteria can be identified. The nutrition education, referrals and service coordination provided by WIC will support the foster parent in developing the skills and knowledge to ensure that the foster child receives appropriate nutrition and health care. Since a foster parent frequently has inadequate information about a new foster child's health needs, the WIC nutritionist can alert the foster parent to the nutritional risks that many foster care children have and suggest ways to improve the child's nutritional status.

The ETS definition also include s the exposure to the aerosol from electronic nicotine deli very systems (2 ). Parti cipant Category and Priority L evel Category Priority Pregnant Women I Breastfeeding Women I Non -Breastfeeding Women III,IV,V, or VI Infants I Children III Justification Most environmental tobacco s moke (ETS) exposure oc curs in homes and workplaces (3 ). It can also happen in public places, such as in restaurants, bars, casinos, and cars and other vehicles (3 ). There are no safe levels of exposure to ETS (1, 4 ). It is known to increase the risk of lung cancer , respiratory diseases, and cardiovascular diseases among adults, and to have adverse effects on birth outcomes and the h ealth of infants and children (4 ). ETS exposure increases oxidative str ess and inflammation (5 -7). Inflammation is associated with asthma (8), cardiovascular diseases (9, 10), cancer (11 ), chronic o bstructive pulmonary disease (12 ), and metabolic syndrome (13, 14 ). ETS from Tobacco Smoking ETS from traditional tobacco and nicotine products is a mixture of the sidestream smoke given off by a burning cigarette, pipe, or cigar , and the mainstream smoke exhaled by smokers . ETS is made up of over 7,000 chemicals , and at least 69 of which are known to cause cancer (1). ETS from Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) Vapes, vaporizers, vape pens, hookah pens, electronic cigarettes (e -cigarettes or e -cigs), and e -pipes are some of the many terms used to describe electronic nico tine delivery systems (ENDS) . ENDS are noncombustible tobacco products used to smoke or \"vape \" a solution that often contains nicotine. The solution, or \"e -liquid,\" is heated to create an aerosol that the user inhales . (15) While ENDS do not produce sidestream vapor, their mainstream vapor has been shown to be hazardous. It contain s chemicals , such as nicotine, which can cause cancer, can harm the fetus, and are a source of indoor air pollution ( 2, 16 -19). An individual's level of exposure to secondhand nicotine depends on the amount of nicotine in the ENDS product, as well as on product chara cteristics, device operation, and the user's inhalation pattern. A few studies have dem onstrated that passive exposure to ENDS among healthy 12/2020 904 2 of 7 Other Risks: Environmental Tobacco Smoke Exposure adults causes an increase in nicotine in the bloodstream that is similar to that from pass ive exposure to cigarett e smoke (2). More research is needed to evaluate health consequences of ETS exposure from ENDS, particularly for pregnant women and children (2 ). The following table summarizes the conditions associated with increased risk from ETS exposure for the mothe r, infant, and child: ETS Source Effects on Mother Effects on Birth Outcomes Effects on Infant Effects on Child Tobacco Smoke Stroke (4 ) Nasal irritation (4) Asthma (4 ) Lung cancer (4) Cardiovascular disease (4 ) Increased levels of inflammation and oxidative stress (5, 6, 7 ) Ectopic pregnancy (4) Fetal growth restriction (4, 20, 21 )* Sudden unexpected infant death (SUID) (4, 20 ) Lower birth weight (21, 22 ) Smaller head circumference (22 ) Impaired l ung growth and function (4) Lower respiratory illnesses (4 ) Middle ear disease ( 4, 20 ) Lower respiratory illness ( 4, 20 ) Increased severity of asthma/whee zing (20) Metabolic syndrome (14) May d evelop in adulthood: Lung cancer (23, 24 ) Cardiovascular diseases (10, 25) Potential nicotine use (26) Electronic Nicotine Delivery System (ENDS) Vapor Limited data , but potential association with (2): Impaired lung funct ion from long -term exposure Dermatitis effects (2): Preterm birth \u00a7 Stillbirth Nicotine exposure effects (2 ): Sudden unexpected infant death (SUID) Impaired brain development Deficits in auditory processing Attention and cognition problems Limited data, but potential association with (2): Nut allergy reaction due to e-liquids containing flavorants derived from nuts *See risk #336 Fetal Growth Restriction for more information .

Data from the Center of Disease Control and Prevention National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003 -2004 found that children exposed to ETS had lower levels of vitamin s A, C, and E , as well as beta -carotene and folate when comp ared to non -exposed children (29). Antioxidants may reduce oxidative stress -induced lung damage among both smokers and non -smokers ( 5-7, 28, 29). Research on preventing oxidative stress -related diseases by antioxidant supplementation has produced mixed results; therefore, it is recommended to consume fruits and vegetables for appropriate antioxidants intake (28, 29). It is recommended that individuals exposed to ETS meet the Recommended Dietary A llowance for vitamin C ( 27, 30). Thirdhand Smoke Thirdhand smoke (THS) is the unintentional intake of tobacco smoke and other related chemicals that occurs without the presence of active smoking . Residual tobacco smoke pollutants adhere to the clothing and hair of smokers , to pet fur, and to surfaces, furnishings, and dust in i ndoor environments (31). Contact with the pollutants can cause nicotine exposure. Infants and children are the most at risk of THS exposure because they spend more time indoors and are closer to or on the ground where the nicotine -contaminated dust accum ulates ( 31, 32 ). Once smoking has occurred indoors, THS cannot be eliminated by airing out rooms, opening windows, using fans or air conditioners, or confining smoking to only certain areas of a home. Replacing items is often the only way to reduce, thou gh not eliminate, resid ual tobacco smoke pollutants (33 ). There is limited research on the extent of negative healt h outcomes from exposure to THS. While THS is not a WIC Nutrition Risk, it should be considered for overall health implications. Implications for WIC Nutrition Services WIC staff can provide the following nutrition services to women , infants and children who are exposed to environmental tobacco smoke : Administer State or l ocal agency substance use s creening methods. For more inform ation, please see: WIC Substance Use Prevention Resource , Chapter 5: https://wicworks.fns.usda.gov/resources/wic - substance -use-prevention -guide. Provide a safe and supportive environment when discussing ETS exposure . For more information on techniques for delivering effective messages, please see: WIC Substance Use -use-prevention -guide. Encourag e fruit and vegetable s that are high in vitamin C . Highlight WIC foods, especially 100% juice that are good sources of vitamin C and other important nutrients. Offer the following suggestions to minimize secondhand and thirdhand smoke exposure (20, 33, 34): o Have smoke -free rules for the car and home. o Make sure places tha t are frequently visited are smo ke-free (i.e., school, work, parks, restaurants, places of worship, etc.) . o Ask anyone who cares for children or pets to follow smoke -free rules. o Those who smoke outside should do so awa y from open doors or windows . 12/2020 904 4 of 7 Other Risks: Environmental Tobacco Smoke Exposure o If smoking has occurred inside a house, c onsider replacing fabric -covered items and thoroughly washing walls . Clarification The following questions were adapted from the validated surveys to be applic able for WIC purposes , and can be used to determine ETS exposure (35, 36 ): In the past seven days, have you and/or child been in an enclosed space while someone used tobacco products?
