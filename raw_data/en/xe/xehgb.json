Subsequently, this information may be used to inform decisions and guide efforts to improve community health and wellness. A Community Health Needs Assessment provides information so that communities may identify issues of greatest c oncern and decide to commit resources to those areas, thereby making the greatest possible impact on community health status. This assessment was conducted on behalf of Hartford HealthCare by Professional Research Consultants, Inc. (PRC). PRC is a nationa lly-recognized healthcare consulting firm with extensive experience conducting Community Health Needs Assessments such as this in hundreds of communities across the United States since 1994. Methodology This assessment incorporates data from both quantitat ive and qualitative sources. Quantitative data input includes primary research (the PRC Community Health Survey) and secondary research (vital statistics and other existing health -related data); these quantitative components allow for comparison to benchm ark data at the state and national levels. Qualitative data input includes primary research gathered through an Online Key Informant Survey of various community stakeholders . PRC Community Health Survey Survey Instrument The survey instrument used for thi s study is based largely on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), as well as various other public health surveys and customized questions addressing gaps in indicator data relative to healt h promotion and disease prevention objectives and other recognized health issues. The final survey instrument was developed by Hartford HealthCare and PRC. Community Defined for This Assessment The study area for the survey effort (referred to as the \" Hartford Hospital Service Area \" in this report , or \"HHSA\" ) is defined by 62 residential ZIP Codes in central Connecticut. This area definition is illustrated in the following map. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 6 Sample Approach & Design A precise and carefully executed methodology is critical in asserting the validity of the results gathered in the PRC Community Health Survey . Thus, to en sure the best representation of the population surveyed, a telephone interview methodology \u2014 one that incorporates both landline and cell phone interviews \u2014 was employed. The primary advantages of telephone interviewing are timeliness, efficiency and rand om-selection capabilities. The sample design used for this effort consisted of a random sample of 1,446 individuals age 18 and older in the Hartford Hospital Service Area . Because this study is part of a larger effort involving multiple regions and hospit al service areas, the surveys were distributed among various strata. Once the interviews were completed, these were weighted in proportion to the actual population distribution so as to appropriately represent the Hartford Hospital Service Area as a whole . All administration of the surveys, data collection and data analysis was conducted by Professional Research Consultants, Inc. (PRC). For statistical purposes, the maximum rate of error associated with a sample size of 1,446 respondents is \u00b12.6% at the 95 percent level of confidence. Sample Characteristics To accurately represent the population studied, PRC strives to minimize bias through application of a proven telephone methodology and random -selection techniques. And, while this random sampling of t he population produces a highly representative sample, it is a common and preferred practice to \"weight\" the raw data to improve this representativeness even further. This is accomplished by adjusting the results of a random COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 7 sample to match the geographic distribution and demographic characteristics of the population surveyed (poststratification), so as to eliminate any naturally occurring bias. The following chart outlines the characteristics of the Hartford Hospital Service Area sample for key demograp hic variables, compared to actual population characteristics revealed in census data. [Note that the sample consisted solely of area residents age 18 and older; data on children were given by proxy by the person most responsible for that child's healthcar e needs, and these children are not represented demographically in this chart.] Population & Survey Sample Characteristics (Hartford Hospital Service Area, 2015) Sources: Census 2010, Summary File 3 (SF 3). US Census Bureau. 2015 PRC Community Health Survey, Professional Research Consultants, 39 40 to 64 65+ White Hispanic Other <200% FPL Actual Population Weighted Survey Sample Further note that the po verty descriptions and segmentation used in this report are based on administrative poverty thresholds determined by the US Department of Health & Human Services. These guidelines define poverty status by household income level and number of persons in th e household (e.g., the 2014 guidelines place the poverty threshold for a family of four at $23,850 annual household income or lower ). In sample segmentation: \" low income \" refers to community members living in a household with defined poverty status or living just above the poverty level, earning up to twice the poverty threshold; \" mid/high income \" refers to those households living on incomes which are twice or more the federal poverty level. The sample design and the quality control procedures used in the data collection ensure that the sample is representative. Thus, the findings may be generalized to the total population of community members in the defined area with a high degree of confidence. Online Key Informant Survey To solicit input from key inform ants, those individuals who have a broad interest in the health of the community, an Online Key Informant Survey was also implemented as part of this process. A list of recommended participants was provided by Hartford HealthCare ; this list included names and contact information for physicians, public health representatives, other health professionals, social service providers, and a variety of other community leaders. Potential participants were chosen because of their ability to identify primary COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 8 concerns of the populations with whom they work, as well as of the community overall. Key informants were contacted by email, introducing the purpose of the survey and providing a link to take the survey online ; reminder emails were sent as needed to increase par ticipation . In all, 47 community stakeholders in the Hartford Hospital Service Area took part in the Online Key Informant Survey, as outlined below: Online Key Informant Survey Participation Key Informant Type Number Invited Number Participating Commun ity/Business Leader 41 11 Other Health (Non -Physician) 19 16 Physician 10 3 Public Health Expert 9 5 Social Services Representative 27 12 Final participation included representatives of the organizations outlined below.

West Hartford -Bloomfield Health District YWCA Through this process, input was gathered from several individuals whose organizati ons work with low-income , minority populations (including African -Americans, American Indians, Asians, Bosnians, Eastern Europeans, ex-offenders, Hispanics, lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender individuals, low -income residents, Middle Eastern peoples, mixed r ace individuals, multiple religion families, non -English speaking persons, refugee i mmigrants, undocumented immigrants, uninsured/underinsured persons, West Indian residents, women), or other medically underserved populations (including t hose with access a nd functional needs, African -Americans, Asians, children, deaf/hard of hearing persons, disabled individuals, the elderly, Hispanics, homeless persons, immigrants, lesbian/gays/bisexual/transgender individuals, low -income residents, Med icaid/Medicare recip ients, mentally ill persons, Native Americans, non -English speaking persons, people in rural areas, racial/ethnic minorities, single parents, those with substance abuse issues, undocumented immigrants, uninsured/ underinsured residents, veterans, young adu lts). In the online survey, key informants were asked to rate the degree to which various health issues are a problem in their own community. Follow -up questions asked them to describe why they identify problem areas as such, and how these might be better addressed. Results of their ratings, as well as their verbatim comments, are included throughout this report as they relate to the various other data presented. NOTE: These findings represent qualitative rather than quantitative data. The Online Key Inform ant Survey was designed to gather input from participants regarding their opinions and perceptions of the health of the residents in the area. Thus, these findings are based on perceptions, not facts. Public Health, Vital Statistics & Other Data A variety of existing (secondary) data sources was consulted to complement the research quality of this Community Health Needs Assessment. Data for the Hartford Hospital Service Area were obtained from the following sources (specific citations are included with the graphs throughout this report): Center for Applied Research and Environmental Systems (CARES) Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, Office of Infectious Disease, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention Centers for Disea se Control & Prevention, Office of Public Health Science Services, Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology and Laboratory Services, Division of Health Informatics and Surveillance (DHIS) COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 10 Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, Office of Public Health Scien ce Services, National Center for Health Statistics Community Commons Connecticut Department of Public Health ESRI ArcGIS Map Gallery National Cancer Institute, State Cancer Profiles OpenStreetMap (OSM) US Census Bureau, American Community Survey US Census Bureau, County Business Patterns US Census Bureau, Decennial Census US Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service US Department of Health & Human Services US Department of Health & Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration (HR SA) US Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation US Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics Note that town -specific secondary data were sought and included where available; the remainder of secondary data indicators reflect county -level data for Hartford County . Benchmark Data State Risk Factor Data Statewide risk factor data are provided where available as an additional benchmark against which to compare local survey findings; these data are reported in the most recent BRFSS (Behavior al Risk Factor Surveillance System) Prevalence and Trend Data published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Health & Human Services. State -level vital statistics are also provided for comparison of secondary data ind icators. Nationwide Risk Factor Data Nationwide risk factor data, which are also provided in comparison charts, are taken from the 2013 PRC National Health Survey ; the methodological approach for the national study is identical to that employed in this assessment, and these data may be generalized to the US population with a high degree of confidence. National -level vital statistics are also provided for comparison of secondary data indicators. Healthy People 2020 Healthy People provides science -based, 10 -year national objectives for improving the health of all Americans. The Healthy People initiative is grounded in the principle that setting national objectives and monitoring progress can motivate action. For three decades, Healthy People has established benchmarks and monitored progress over time in order to: Encourage collaborations across sectors. Guide individuals toward making informed health decisions. Measure the impact of prevention activities. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 11 Healthy People 2020 is the product of an extensive stakeholder feedback process that is unparalleled in government and health. It integrates input from public health and prevention experts, a wide range of federal, state and local government officials, a consortium of more than 2,000 organizations, and pe rhaps most importantly, the public. More than 8,000 comments were considered in drafting a comprehensive set of Healthy People 2020 objectives. Determining Significance Differences noted in this report represent those determined to be significant. For su rvey-derived indicators (which are subject to sampling error), statistical significance is determined based on confidence intervals (at the 95 percent confidence level) using question -specific samples and response rates. For secondary data indicators (whi ch do not carry sampling error, but might be subject to reporting error), \"significance,\" for the purpose of this report, is determined by a 5% variation from the comparative measure. Information Gaps While this assessment is quite comprehensive, it can not measure all possible aspects of health in the community, nor can it adequately represent all possible populations of interest. It must be recognized that these information gaps might in some ways limit the ability to assess all of the community's he alth needs. For example, certain population groups \u2014 such as the homeless, institutionalized persons, or those who only speak a language other than English or Spanish \u2014 are not represented in the survey data. Other population groups \u2014 for example, pregna nt women, lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender residents, undocumented residents, and members of certain racial/ethnic or immigrant groups \u2014 might not be identifiable or might not be represented in numbers sufficient for independent analyses. In terms of co ntent, this assessment was designed to provide a comprehensive and broad picture of the health of the overall community. However, there are certainly a great number of medical conditions that are not specifically addressed.

Profes sional Research Consultants, Inc. (PRC) began the meeting with a presentation of key findings from the CHNA, highlighting the significant health issues identified from the research. Following the data review, PRC answered any questions and facilitated a gr oup dialogue, allowing participants to advocate for any of the health issues discussed. Subsequent ly, participants were provided an overview of the prioritization exercise that followed. In order to assign priority to the identified health needs, a wireless audience response system was used in which each participant was able to register his/her ratings usi ng a small remote keypad. The participants were asked to evaluate each health issue along two criteria: Scope & Severity \u2014 The first rating was to gauge the magnitude of the problem in consideration of the following: How many people are affected? How does the local community data compare to state or national levels, or Healthy People 2020 targets? To what degree does each health issue lead to death or disability, impair quality of life, or impact other health issues? Ratings were entered on a scale of 1 (no t very prevalent at all, with only minimal health consequences) to 10 (extremely prevalent, with very serious health consequences). Ability to Impact \u2014 A second rating was designed to measure the perceived likelihood of the hospital COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 16 having a positive impa ct on each health issue, given available resources, competencies, spheres of influence, etc. Ratings were entered on a scale of 1 (no ability to impact) to 10 (great ability to impact). Individuals' ratings for each criteria were averaged for each tested health issue, and then these composite criteria scores were averaged to produce an overall score. This process yielded the following prioritized list of community health needs: 1. Nutrition, Physical Activity & Weight 2. Diabetes 3. Mental Health 4. Heart Disease & Stroke 5. Substance Abuse 6. Infant Health & Family Planning 7. Cancer 8. HIV/AIDS 9. Sexually Transmitted Diseases 10. Injury & Violence 11. Respiratory Disease s 12. Chronic Kidney Disease 13. Dementias, Including Alzheimer's Disease While the hospital will likely not implement strategies for all of these health issues, the results of this prioritization exercise will be used to inform the development of the hospital 's Implementation Strategy to establish community partnerships and address the top health ne eds of the community in the coming years.

Data Charts & Key Informant Input COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 32 Community Characteristics Population Characteristics Data from the US Census Bureau reveal the following statistics for our community relative to size, population, density, age, race/ethnicity and lang uage. Keep in mind: A significant positive or negative shift in total population over time impacts healthcare providers and the utilization of community resources. Urban areas are identified using population density, count, and size thresholds. Urban area s also include territory with a high degree of impervious surface (development). Rural areas are all areas that are not urban. It is important to understand the age distribution of the population as different age groups have unique health needs which shoul d be considered separately from others along the age spectrum.

We know that taking care of ourselves by eating well and staying active, not smoking, getting the recommended immunizations and screening tests, and seeing a doctor when we are sick all influence our health. Our health is also determined in part by access to social and economic opportuniti es; the resources and supports available in our homes, neighborhoods, and communities; the quality of our schooling; the saf ety of our workplaces; the cleanliness of our water, food, and air; and the nature of our social interactions and relationships. The conditions in which we live explain in part why some Americans are healthier than others and why Americans more generally are not as healthy as they could be.

Compared with people without disabilities, people with disabilities are more likely to: Experience difficulties or delays in getting the health care they need. Not have had an annual dental visit . Not have had a mammogram in past 2 years. Not have had a Pap test within the past 3 years. Not engage in fitness activities. Use tobacco. Be overweight or obese. Have high blood pressure. Experience symptoms of psychological distress. Receive less social -emotional support. Have lower employment rates. There are many social and physical factors that influence the health of people with disabilities. The following three areas f or public health action have been identified, using the International Classificati on of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) and the three World Health Organization (WHO) principles of action for addressing health determinants. Improve the conditions of daily life by: encouraging communities to be accessible so all can live in, m ove through, and interact with their environment; encouraging community living; and removing barriers in the environment using both physical universal design concepts and operational policy shifts. Address the inequitable distribution of resources among pe ople with disabilities and those without disabilities by increasing: appropriate health care for people with disabilities; education and work opportunities; social participation; and access to needed technologies and assistive supports. Expand the knowledg e base and raise awareness about determinants of health for people with disabilities by increasing: the inclusion of people with disabilities in public health data collection efforts across the lifespan; the inclusion of people with disabilities in health promotion activities; and the expansion of disability and health training opportunities for public health and health care professionals.

Mental health is essential to personal wel l- being, family and interpersonal relationships, and the ability to contribute to community or society. Mental disorders are h ealth conditions that are characterized by alterations in thinking, mood, and/or behavior that are associated with distress and/or impaired functioning. Mental disorders contribute to a host of problems that may include disability, pain, or death. Mental i llness is the term that refers collectively to all diagnosable mental disorders. Mental disorders are among the most common causes of disability. The resulting disease burden of mental illness is among the highest of all diseases. Mental health and physi cal health are closely connected. Mental health plays a major role in people's ability to maintain good physical health. Mental illnesses, such as depression and anxiety, affect people's ability to participate in health -promoting behaviors. In turn, proble ms with physical health, such as chronic diseases, can have a serious impact on mental health and decrease a person's ability to participate in treatment and recovery. The existing model for understanding mental health and mental disorders emphasizes the interaction of social, environmental, and genetic factors throughout the lifespan. In behavioral health, researchers identify: risk factors , which predispose individuals to mental illness; and protective factors , which protect them from developing mental d isorders. Researchers now know that the prevention of mental, emotional, and behavioral (MEB) disorders is inherently interdisciplinary and draws on a variety of different strategies. Over the past 20 years, research on the prevention of mental disorders has progressed. The major areas of progress include evidence that: MEB disorders are common and begin early in life. The greatest opportunity for prevention is among young people. There are multiyear effects of multiple preventive interventions on reducin g substance abuse, conduct disorder, antisocial behavior, aggression, and child maltreatment. The incidence of depression among pregnant women and adolescents can be reduced. School -based violence prevention can reduce the base rate of aggressive problems in an average school by 25 to 33%. There are potential indicated preventive interventions for schizophrenia. Improving family functioning and positive parenting can have positive outcomes on mental health and can reduce poverty -related risk. School -based p reventive interventions aimed at improving social and emotional outcomes can also improve academic outcomes. Interventions targeting families dealing with adversities, such as parental depression or divorce, can be effective in reducing risk for depression in children and increasing effective parenting. Some preventive interventions have benefits that exceed costs, with the available evidence strongest for early childhood interventions. Implementation is complex, it is important that interventions be releva nt to the target audiences. In addition to advancements in the prevention of mental disorders, there continues to be steady progress in treating mental disorders as new drugs and stronger evidence -based outcomes become available.

Together, heart disease and stroke are among the most widespread and costly heal th problems facing the nation today, accounting for more than $500 billion in healthcare expenditures and related expenses in 2010 alone. Fortunately, they are also among the most preventable. The leading modifiable (controllable) risk factors for heart d isease and stroke are: High blood pressure High cholesterol Cigarette smoking Diabetes Poor diet and physical inactivity Overweight and obesity The risk of Americans developing and dying from cardiovascular disease would be substantially reduced if major i mprovements were made across the US population in diet and physical activity, control of high blood pressure and cholesterol, smoking cessation, and appropriate aspirin use. The burden of cardiovascular disease is disproportionately distributed across the population. There are significant disparities in the following based on gender, age, race/ethnicity, geographic area, and socioeconomic status: Prevalence of risk factors Access to treatment Appropriate and timely treatment Treatment outcomes Mortality Disease does not occur in isolation, and cardiovascular disease is no exception. Cardiovascular health is significantly influenced by the physical, social, and political environment, including: maternal and child health; access to educational opportunities; availability of healthy foods, physical education, and extracurricular activities in schools; opportunities for physical activity, including access to safe and walkable communities; access to healthy foods; quality of working conditions and worksite health ; availability of community support and resources; and access to affordable, quality healthcare.

People who are overweight have a higher risk for cardiovascular disease. Almost 60% of adults are overweight or obese. To maintain a proper body weight, experts recommend a well -balanced diet which is low in fat and high in fiber, accompanied by regular exercise. Lack of physical activity . People who are not physically active have twice the risk for heart disease of those who are active. More than half of adults do not achieve recommended levels of physical activity. Tobacco use . Smokers have twice the risk for heart attack of nonsmokers. Nearly one -fifth of all deaths from cardiovascular disease, or about 190,000 deaths a year nationally, are smoking -related. Every day, more than 3,000 young people become daily smokers in the US Modifying thes e behaviors is critical both for preventing and for controlling cardiovascular disease. Other steps that adults who have cardiovascular disease should take to reduce their risk of death and disability include adhering to treatment for high b lood pressure a nd cholesterol, using aspirin as appropriate, and learning the symptoms of heart attack and stroke.

Blacks and Hispanics are more likely to suffer from obesity and hypertension, two of the major risk factors for heart disease . - Health Provider (Non -Physician) Lead cause of death . - Public Health Expert Studies/assessments have determined that to be the case . - Community/Business Leader Nutrition, Physical Activity & Weight Bad habits of today, that offer immediate gratification, leads to these health risks down the road. Stress, poor diets, lack of exercise (no time) are all becoming more a part of our lives. Primary Care can address some challenges when people have coverage and can make their co -payments, but our society has become more \"give me what I want now, I'll deal with th e consequences later.\" While school meals seem to be improving for our children, the pressure to improve testing scores has led to the elimination of recess and cut down on physical education/activity in many school systems, another example of what we dee m to be our priority . - Health Provider (Non -Physician) Poor diet and exercise. Lack of education. Poor parks and recreation options. Poor urban planning, community infrastructure, barrier to physical activity. Food, desserts . - Public Health Expert There is a high prevalence of obesity in Hartford which is linked to heart disease. Further there are a number of barriers to accessing nutritious food which make it difficult for families to eat regular balanced nutritious meals . - Community/Business Leader High-stress lifestyles, lack of exercise, lack of access to and affordability of healthy foods, heavy smoking and consuming alcoholic beverages in excess . - Social Services Representative Poverty, inadequate diets, not taking the problem serious . - Social Services Representative At-Risk Populations African Americans and Hispanics which make up a large percentage of the Hartford population are often affected by heart disease and stroke. Reasons being due to genetics, but largely because of a poor unbalanced diet which contains a vast amount carbohydrates, fats and sodium and not enough grains, fruits and vegetables . - Health Provider (Non -Physician) With the high rates of diabetes in the city, the risk for heart disease and stroke is also elevated . - Commun ity/Business Leader Heart disease and stroke in the community are usual as result of another chronic disease not being managed . - Social Services Representative Individuals who cannot afford care often go untreated with progression of disease states.

Among people who develop cancer, more than half will be alive in five years. Yet, cancer remains a leading cause of death in the United States, second only to heart disease. Many cancers are preventable by reducing risk factors such as: u se of tobacco products; physical inactivity and poor nutrition; obesity; and ultraviolet light exposure. Other cancers can be prevented by getting vaccinated against human papillomavirus and hepatitis B virus. In the past decade, overweight and obesity h ave emerged as new risk factors for developing certain cancers, including colorectal, breast, uterine corpus (endometrial), and kidney cancers. The impact of the current weight tre nds on cancer incidence will not be fully known for several decades. Continu ed focus on preventing weight gain will lead to lower rates of cancer and many chronic diseases. Screening is effective in identifying some types of cancers (see US Preventive Services Task Force [USPSTF] recommendations), including: Breast cancer (using m ammography) Cervical cancer (using Pap tests) Colorectal cancer (using fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy) Healthy People 2020 (www.healthypeople.gov) Age-Adjusted Cancer Deaths The following chart illustrates age -adjusted mortalit y in select towns in the Hartford Hospital Service Area .

All cancers caused by cigarette smoking could be prevented. At least one -third of cancer deaths that occur in the United States are due to cigarette smoking. According to the American Cancer Society, abo ut one -third of cancer deaths that occur in the United States each year are due to nutrition and physical activity factors, including obesity. National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Cancer Screenings The American Cancer Society recommends that both men and women get a cancer -related checkup during a regular doctor's checkup. It should include examination for cancers of the thyroid, testicles, ovaries, lymph nodes, oral cavity, and sk in, as well as health counseling about tobacco, sun exposure, diet and nutrition, risk factors, sexual practices, and environmental and occupational exposures. Screening levels in the community were measured in the PRC Community Health Survey relative to : female breast cancer (mammography); cervical cancer (Pap smear testing); and colorectal cancer (sigmoidoscopy and fecal occult blood testing). COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 60 Female Breast Cancer Screening About Screening for Breast Cancer The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening mammography, with or without clinical breast examination (CBE), every 1 -2 years for women age 40 and older. Rationale: The USPSTF found fair evidence that mammography screening every 12 -33 months significantly reduces mortality from b reast cancer. Evidence is strongest for women age 50 -69, the age group generally included in screening trials. For women age 40 -49, the evidence that screening mammography reduces mortality from breast cancer is weaker, and the absolute benefit of mammogra phy is smaller, than it is for older women. Most, but not all, studies indicate a mortality benefit for women undergoing mammography at ages 40 -49, but the delay in observed benefit in women younger than 50 makes it difficult to determine the incremental b enefit of beginning screening at age 40 rather than at age 50. The absolute benefit is smaller because the incidence of breast cancer is lower among women in their 40s than it is among older women. The USPSTF concluded that the evidence is also generalizab le to women age 70 and older (who face a higher absolute risk for breast cancer) if their life expectancy is not compromised by comorbid disease. The absolute probability of benefits of regular mammography increase along a continuum with age, whereas the l ikelihood of harms from screening (false - positive results and unnecessary anxiety, biopsies, and cost) diminish from ages 40 -70. The balance of benefits and potential harms, therefore, grows more favorable as women age. The precise age at which the potenti al benefits of mammography justify the possible harms is a subjective choice. The USPSTF did not find sufficient evidence to specify the optimal screeni ng interval for women age 40 -49. US Preventive Services Task Force, Agency for Healthcare Research and Q uality, US Department of Health & Human Services Note that other organizations (e.g., American Cancer Society, American Academy of Family Physicians, American College of Phys icians, National Cancer Institute) may have slightly different screening guidelin es. Cervical Cancer Screenings About Screening for Cervical Cancer The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) strongly recommends screening for cervical cancer in women who have been sexually active and have a cervix. Rationale: The USPSTF found good evidence from multiple observational studies that screening with cervical cytology (Pap smears) reduces incidence of and mortality from cervical cancer. Direct evidence to determine the optimal starting and stopping age and interval for screening is limit ed. Indirect evidence suggests most of the benefit can be obtained by beginning screening within 3 years of onset of sexual activity or age 21 (whichever comes first) and screening at least every 3 years. The USPSTF concludes that the benefits of screening substantially outweigh potential harms. The USPSTF recommends against routinely screening women older than age 65 for cervical cancer if they have had adequate recent screening with normal Pap smears and are not otherwise at high risk for cervical cancer. Rationale: The USPSTF found limited evidence to determine the benefits of continued screening in women older than 65. The yield of screening is low in previously screened women older than 65 due to the declining incidence of high -grade cervical lesions a fter middle age. There is fair evidence that screening women older than 65 is associated with an increased risk for potential harms, including false -positive results and invasive procedures. The USPSTF concludes that the potential harms of screening are li kely to exceed benefits among older women who have had normal results previously and who are not otherwise at high risk for cervical cancer. The USPSTF recommends against routine Pap smear screening in women who have had a total hysterectomy for benign disease. Rationale: The USPSTF found fair evidence that the yield of cytologic screening is very low in women after hysterectomy and poor evidence that screening to detect vaginal cancer improves health outcomes. The USPSTF concludes that potential harms of continued screening after hysterectomy are likely to exceed benefits. US Preventive Services Task Force, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, US Department of Health & Human Services Note that other organizations (e.g., American Cancer Society, Ame rican Academy of Family Physicians, American College of Physicians, National Cancer Institute) may have slightly different screening guidelines. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 61 Colorectal Cancer Screenings About Screening for Colorectal Cancer The USPSTF recommends screening for colorec tal cancer using fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy in adults, beginning at age 50 years and continuing until age 75 years. The evidence is convincing that screening for colorectal cancer with fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscop y, or colonoscopy detects early -stage cancer and adenomatous polyps. There is convincing evidence that screening with any of the three recommended tests (FOBT, sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy) reduces colorectal cancer mortality in adults age 50 to 75 years. Follow -up of positive screening test results requires colonoscopy regardless of the screening test used. US Preventive Services Task Force, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, US Department of Health & Human Services Note that other organizations (e.g., American Cancer Society, American Academy of Family Physicians, American College of Physicians, National Cancer Instit ute) may have slightly different screening guidelines.

Specific methods of detection, intervention, and treatment exist that may reduce this burden and promote health. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways characterize d by episodes of reversible breathing problems due to airway narrowing and obstruction. These episodes can range in severity from mild to life threatening. Symptoms of asthma include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Daily preve ntive treatment can prevent symptoms and attacks and enable individuals who have asthma to lead active lives. COPD is a preventable and treatable disease characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow lim itation is usually p rogressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lung to noxious particles or gases (typically from exposure to cigarette smoke). Treatment can lessen symptoms and improve quality of life for those with COPD. The burden of respirato ry diseases affects individuals and their families, schools, workplaces, neighborhoods, cities, and states. Because of the cost to the healthcare system, the burden of respiratory diseases also falls on society; it is paid fo r with higher health insurance rates, lost productivity, and tax dollars. Annual healthcare expenditures for asthma alone are estimated at $20.7 billion. Asthma . The prevalence of asthma has increased since 1980. However, deaths from asthma have decreased since the mid - 1990s. The caus es of asthma are an active area of research and involve both genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors for asthma currently being investigated include: Having a parent with asthma Sensitization to irritants and allergens Respiratory infections in chi ldhood Overweight Asthma affects people of every race, sex, and age. However, significant disparities in asthma morbidity and mortality exist, in particular for low -income and minority populations. Populations with higher rates of asthma include: children ; women (among adults) and boys (among children); African Americans; Puerto Ricans; people living in the Northeast United States; people living below the Federal poverty level; and employees with certain exposures in the workplace. While there is not a cur e for asthma yet, there are diagnoses and treatment guidelines that are aimed at ensuring that all people with asthma live full and active lives.

Both unintentional injuries and those caused by acts of violen ce are among the top 15 killers for Americans of all ages. Many people accept them as \"accidents,\" \"acts of fate,\" or as \"part of life.\" Howev er, most events resulting in injury, disability, or death are predictable and preventable. Injuries are the leadi ng cause of death for Americans ages 1 to 44, and a leading cause of disability for all ages, regardless of sex, race/ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. More than 180,000 people die from injuries each year, and approximately 1 in 10 sustains a nonfatal in jury serious enough to be treated in a hospital emergency department. Beyond their immediate health consequences, injuries and violence have a significant impact on the well -being of Americans by contributing to: Premature death Disability Poor mental hea lth High medical costs Lost productivity The effects of injuries and violence extend beyond the injured person or victim of violence to family members, friends, coworkers, employers, and communities. Numerous factors can affect the risk of unintentional i njury and violence, including individual behaviors, physical environment, access to health services (ranging from pre -hospital and acute care to rehabilitation), and social environment (from parental monitoring and supervision of youth to peer group associ ations, neighborhoods, and communities). Interventions addressing these social and physical factors have the potential to prevent unintentional injuries and violence. Efforts to prevent unintentional injury may focus on: Modifications of the environment Improvements in product safety Legislation and enforcement Education and behavior change Technology and engineering Efforts to prevent violence may focus on: Changing social norms about the acceptability of violence Improving problem -solving skills (for exam ple, parenting, conflict resolution, coping) Changing policies to address the social and economic conditions that often give rise to violence Healthy People 2020 (www.healthypeople.gov) COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 70 Leading Causes of Accidental Death Leading causes of accidental dea th in the area include the following: Leading Causes of Accidental Death (Hartford County, 2011 -2013) Sources: CDC WONDER Online Query System.

Insulin is a hormone that the body needs to absorb and use glucose (sugar) as fuel for the bo dy's cells. Without a properly functioning insulin signaling system, blood glucose levels become elevated and other metabolic abnormalities occur, leading to the development of serious, disabling complications. Many forms of diabetes exist; the three comm on types are Type 1, Type 2, and gestational diabetes. Effective therapy can prevent or delay diabetic complications. Diabetes mellitus: Lowers life expectancy by up to 15 years. Increases the risk of heart disease by 2 to 4 times. Is the leading cause o f kidney failure, lower limb amputations, and adult -onset blindness. The rate of diabetes mellitus continues to increase both in the United States and throughout the world. Due to the steady ris e in the number of persons with diabetes mellitus, and possibl y earlier onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus, there is growing concern about the possibility that the increase in the number of persons with diabetes mellitus and the complexity of their care migh t overwhelm existing healthcare systems. People from minority populations are more frequently affected by type 2 diabetes. Minority groups constitute 25% of all adult patients with diabetes in the US and represent the majority of children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes. Lifestyle change has been proven effec tive in preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes in high -risk individuals.

Dementia is not a disease itself, but rather a set of symptoms. Memory loss is a common symptom of dementia, a lthough memory loss by itself does not mean a person has dementia. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for the majority of all diagnosed cases. Alzheimer's disease is the 6 th leading cause of death among adults age 18 year s and older. Estimates vary, but experts suggest that up to 5.1 million Americans age 65 years and older have Alzheimer's disease. These numbers are predicted to more than double by 2050 unless more effective ways to treat and prevent Alzheimer's disease a re found.

They are responsible for premature death and exact a high economic price from both the private and public sectors. Nearly 25% of the Medicare budget is used to treat people with chronic kidney disease and e nd-stage renal disease. Genetic determinants have a large influence on the development and progression of chronic kidney disease. It is not possible to alter a person's biology and genetic determinants; however, environmental influences and individual beha viors also have a significant influence on the development and progression of chronic kidney disease. As a result, some populations are disproportionately affected. Successful behavior modification is expected to have a positive influence on the disease. Diabetes is the most common cause of kidney failure. The results of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) funded by the national Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) show that moderate exercise, a healthier diet, and weight redu ction can prevent development of type 2 diabetes in persons at risk.

Arthritis commonly occurs with other chronic conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. Interventions to treat the pain and reduce the functional limitations from arthritis are important, and may also enable people with these other chronic conditions to be more physically active. Arthritis affects 1 in 5 adults and continues to be the most common cause of disability. It costs more than $128 billion per year. All of the human and economic costs are projected to in crease over time as the population ages. There are interventions that can reduce arthritis pain and functional limitations, but they remain underused. These include: increased physical activity; self -management education; and weight loss among overweight /obese adults. Osteoporosis is a disease marked by reduced bone strength leading to an increased risk of fractures (broken bones). In the United States, an estimated 5.3 million people age 50 years and older have osteoporosis. Most of these people are wome n, but about 0.8 million are men. Just over 34 million more people, including 12 million men, have low bone mass, which puts them at increased risk for developing osteoporosis. Half of all women and as many as 1 in 4 men age 50 years and older will have an osteoporosis -related fracture in their lifetime. Chronic back pain is common, costly, and potentially disabling. About 80% of Americans experience low back pain in their lifetime. It is estimated that each year: 15%-20% of the population develop protrac ted back pain. 2-8% have chronic back pain (pain that lasts more than 3 months). 3-4% of the population is temporarily disabled due to back pain. 1% of the working -age population is disabled completely and permanently as a result of low back pain. American s spend at least $50 billion each year on low back pain. Low back pain is the: 2nd leading cause of lost work time (after the common cold). 3rd most common reason to undergo a surgical procedure. 5th most frequent cause of hospitalization. Arthritis, osteo porosis, and chronic back conditions all have major effects on quality of life, the ability to work, and basic activities of daily living.

Yet millions of Americans live with visual impairment, and many more remain at risk for eye disease and preventable eye injury. The eyes are an important, but often overlooked, part of overall health. Despite the preventable nature of some vision impairments, many people do not receive recommended screenings and exams. A visit to an eye care professional for a comprehensive dilated eye exam can help to detect common vision problems and eye disea ses, including diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, and age -related macular degeneration. These common vision problems often have no early warning signs. If a problem is detected, an eye care professional can prescribe corrective eyewear, medicine, or surgery to minimize vision loss and help a person see his or her best. Healthy vision can help to ensure a healthy and active lifestyle well into a person's later years. Educating and engaging families, communities, and the nation is critical to ensuring that people have the information, resources, and tools needed for good eye health. Healthy People 2020 (www.healthypeople.gov) Hearing Trouble About Hearing & Other Sensory or Communication Disorders An impaired ability to communicate with others or ma intain good balance can lead many people to feel socially isolated, have unmet health needs, have limited success in school or on the job. Communication and other sensory processes contribute to our overall health and well -being. Protecting these processes is critical, particularly for people whose age, race, ethnicity, gender, occupation, genetic background, or health status places them at increased risk. Many factors influence the numbers of Americans who are diagnosed and treated for hearing and other s ensory or communication disorders, such a social determinants (social and economic standings, age of diagnosis, cost and stigma of wearing a hearing aid, and unhealthy lifestyle choices). In addition, biological causes of hearing loss and other sensory or communication disorders include: genetics; viral or bacterial infections; sensitivity to certain drugs or medications; injury ; and aging. As the nation's population ages and survival rates for medically fragile infants and for people with severe injuries and acquired diseases improve, the prevalence of sensory and communication disorders is expected to rise.

However, infectious diseases remain a major cause of illness, disability, and death. Immunization recommendations in the United States currently target 17 vaccine - preventable diseases across the lifespan. People in the US continue to get diseases that are vaccine -preventable. Viral hepatitis, influenza, and tuberculosis (TB) remain among the leading causes of illness and death across the nation and account for substantial spending on the related consequences of infection. The infectious disease public health infrastructure, which carries out disease surveillance at the national, state, and local levels, is an essential tool in the fight against newly emerging and re -emerging infectious diseases. Other important defenses against infectious diseases inclu de: Proper use of vaccines Antibiotics Screening and testing guidelines Scientific improvements in the diagnosis of infectious disease -related health concerns Vaccines are among the most cost -effective clinical preventive services and are a core component of any preventive services package. Childhood immunization programs provide a very high return on investment. For example, for each birth cohort vaccinated with the routine immunization schedule, society: Saves 33,000 lives. Prevents 14 million cases of d isease. Reduces direct healthcare costs by $9.9 billion. Saves $33.4 billion in indirect costs. Healthy People 2020 (www.healthypeople.gov) Influenza & Pneumonia Vaccination About Influenza & Pneumonia Acute respiratory infections, including pneumonia an d influenza, are the 8th leading cause of death in the nation, accounting for 56,000 deaths annually. Pneumonia mortality in children fell by 97% in the last century, but respiratory infectious disea ses continue to be leading causes of pediatric hospitaliz ation and outpatient visits in the US. On average, influenza leads to more than 200,000 hospitalizations and 36,000 deaths each year. The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic caused an estimated 270,000 hospitalizations and 12,270 deaths (1,270 of which were of pe ople younger than age 18) between April 2009 and March 2010.

An estimated 1.1 million Americans are living with HIV, and 1 in 5 people with HIV do not know they have it. HIV c ontinues to spread, leading to about 56,000 new HIV infections each year. HIV is a preventable disease, and effective HIV prevention interventions have been proven to reduce HIV transmission. People who get tested for HIV and learn that they are infected can make significant behavior changes to improve their health and reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to their sex or drug -using partners. More than 50% of new HIV infections occur as a result of the 21% of people who have HIV but do not know it. In the er a of increasingly effective treatments for HIV, people with HIV are living longer, healthier, and more productive lives. Deaths from HIV infection have greatly declined in the United States since the 1990s. As the number of people living with HIV grows, it will be more important than ever to increase national HIV prev ention and healthcare programs. There are gender, race, and ethnicity disparities in new HIV infections: Nearly 75% of new HIV infections occur in men. More than half occur in gay and bisexual men, regardless of race or ethnicity. 45% of new HIV infections occur in African Americans, 35% in whites, and 17% in Hispanics. Improving access to quality healthcare for populations disproportionately affected by HIV, such as persons of color and gay and bisexual men, is a fundamental public health strategy for HIV prevention. People getting care for HIV can receive: Antiretroviral therapy Screening and treatment for other diseases (such as sexually transmitted infections) HIV prevention interventions Mental health services Other health services As the number of people living with HIV increases and more people become aware of their HIV status, prevention strategies that are targeted specifically for HIV -infected people are becoming more important. Preve ntion work with people living with HIV focuses on: Linking to and staying in treatment. Increasing the availability of ongoing HIV prevention interventions. Providing prevention services for their partners. Public perception in the US about the seriousnes s of the HIV epidemic has declined in recent years. There is evidence that risky behaviors may be increasing among uninfected people, especially gay and bisexual men. Ongoing media and social campaigns for the general public and HIV prevention intervention s for uninfected persons who engage in risky behaviors are critical.

Despite their burdens, costs, and complications, and the fact that they are largely preventable, STDs remain a significant public health problem in the United States. This pr oblem is largely unrecognized by the public, policymakers, and health care professionals. STDs cause many harmful, often irreversible, and costly clinical complications, such as: reproductive health problems; fetal and perinat al health problems; cancer; an d facilitation of the sexual transmission of HIV infection. Because many cases of STDs go undiagnosed \u2014and some common viral infections, such as human papillomavirus (HPV) and genital herpes, are not reported to CDC at all \u2014the reported cases of chlamydia, g onorrhea, and syphilis represent only a fraction of the true burden of STDs in the US. Untreated STDs can lead to serious long -term health consequences, especially for adolescent girls and young women. Several factors contribute to the spread of STDs. Biological Factors. STDs are acquired during unprotected sex with an infected partner. Biological factors that affect the spread of STDs include: Asymptomatic nature of STDs . The majority of STDs either do not produce any symptoms or signs, or they produce symptoms so mild that they are unnoticed; consequently, many infected persons do not know that they need medical care. Gender disparities . Women suffer more frequent and more serious STD complications than men do. Among the most serious STD complications are pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside of the uterus), infertility, and chronic pelvic pain. Age disparities . Compared to older adults, sexually active adolescents ages 15 to 19 and young adults ages 20 to 24 are at higher r isk for getting STDs. Lag time between infection and complications . Often, a long interval, sometimes years, occurs between acquiring an STD and recognizing a clinically significant health problem. Social, Economic and Behavioral Factors. The spread of S TDs is directly affected by social, economic, and behavioral factors. Such factors may cause serious obstacles to STD prevention due to their influence on social and sexual networks, access to and provision of care, willingness to seek care, and social nor ms regarding sex and sexuality. Among certain vulnerable populations, historical experience with segregation and discrimination exacerbates these factors. Social, economic , and behavioral factors that affect the spread of STDs include: racial and ethnic di sparities; poverty and marginalization; access to healthcare; substance abuse; sexuality and secrecy (stigma and discomfort discussing sex); and sexual networks (persons \"linked\" by sequential or concurrent sexual partners ). (www.heal thypeople.gov) Chlamydia & is re ported STD in the United States; m ost people who have chlamydia don't know it since the disease often has no symptoms. Gonorrhea. Anyone who is sexually active can get g onorrhea. Gonorrhea can be cured with the right medication; left untreated, however, gonorrhea can cause serious health problems in both women and men.

Their well -being deter mines the health of the next generation and can help predict future public health challenges for families, communities, and the healthcare system. The risk of maternal and infant mortality and pregnancy -related complications can be reduced by increasing ac cess to quality preconception (before pregnancy) and inter -conception (between pregnancies) care. Moreover, healthy birth outcomes and early identification and treatment of health conditions among infants can prevent death or disabil ity and enable children to reach their full potential. Many factors can affect pregnancy and childbirth, including pre -conception health status, age, access to appropriate healthcare, and poverty. Infant and child health are similarly influenced by socio -demographic factors, suc h as family income, but are also linked to the physical and mental health of parents and caregivers. There are racial and ethnic disparities in mortality and morbidity for mothers and children, particularly for African Americans. These differences are lik ely the result of many factors, including social determinants (such as racial and ethnic disparities in infant mortality; family income; educational attainment among househol d members; and health insurance coverage) and physical determinants (i.e., the hea lth, nutrition, and behaviors of the mother during pregnancy and early childhood). Healthy People 2020 (www.healthypeople.gov) Early and continuous prenatal care is the best assurance of infant health.

This study found that behavior patterns r epresent the single -most prominent domain of influence over health prospects in the United States. The daily choices we make with respect to diet, physical activity, and sex; the substance abuse and addictions to which we fall prey; our approach to safety; and our coping strategies in confronting stress are all important determinants of health. The most prominent contributors to mortality in the United States in 2000 were tobacco (an estimated 435,000 deaths), diet and activity patterns (400,000), alcohol (85,000), microbial agents (75,000), toxic agents (55,000), motor vehicles (43,000), firearms (29,000), sexual behavior (20,000), and illicit use of drugs (17,000). Socioeconomic status and access to medical care are also important contributors, but diffic ult to quantify independent of the other factors cited. Because the studies reviewed used different approaches to derive estimates, the stated numbers should be viewed as first approximations. These analyses show that smoking remains the leading cause of mortality. However, poor diet and physical inactivity may soon overtake tobacco as the leading cause of death. These findings, along with escalating healthcare costs and aging population, argue persuasively that the need to establish a more preventive o rientation in the US healthcare and public health systems has become more urgent.

Efforts to change diet and weight should address individual behaviors, as well as the policies and environments that support these behaviors in settings such as schools, worksites, healthcare organizations, and communities. The goal of promoting healthful diets and healthy weight encompasses increasing household food security and eliminating hunger. Americans with a healthful diet: Consume a variety of nutrient -dense foods within and across the food groups, espec ially whole grains, fruits, vegetables, low -fat or fat -free milk or milk products, and lean meats and other protein sources. Limit the intake of saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, added sugars, sodium (salt), and alcohol. Limit caloric intake to meet c aloric needs. Diet and body weight are related to health status. Good nutrition is important to the growth and development of children. A healthful diet also helps Americans reduce their risks for many health conditions, including: overweight and obesity; malnutrition; iron -deficiency constipation; diverticular disease; and some cancers. Diet reflects the variety of foods and beverag es consumed over time and in settings such as worksites, schools, restaurants, and the home. Interventions to support a healthier diet can help ensure that: Individuals have the knowledge and skills to make healthier choices. Healthier options are availabl e and affordable. Social Determinants of Diet. Demographic characteristics of those with a more healthful diet vary with the nutrient or food studied. However, most Americans need to improve some aspect of their diet. Social factors thought to influence diet include: Knowledge and attitudes Skills Social support Societal and cultural norms Food and agricultural policies Food assistance programs Economic price systems Physical Determinants of Diet. Access to and availability of healthier foods can help p eople follow healthful diets. For example, better access to retail venues that sell healthier options may have a positive impact on a person's diet; these venu es may be less available in low -income or rural neighborhoods. The places where people eat appea r to influence their diet. For example, foods eaten away from home often have more calories and are of lower nutritional quality than foods prepared at home. Marketing also influences people's \u2014particularly children's \u2014food choices.

Among adults and older adults, physical activity can lower the risk of: early death; coronary heart disease; stroke; high blood pressure; type 2 diabetes; breast and colon cancer; falls; and depression. Among children and adolescents, physical activity can: improve bone health; improve cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness; decrease levels of body fat; and reduce symptoms of depression. For people who are inactive, even small increases in physical activity are associated with health benefits. Personal, social, economic, and environmental factors all play a role in physical activity levels among youth, adults, and ol der adults. Understanding the barriers to and facil itators of physical activity is important to ensure the effectiveness of interventions and other actions to improve levels of physical activity. Factors positively associated with adult physical activity include: postsecondary education; higher income; enj oyment of exercise; benefits; belief in ability to exercise (self -efficacy); history of activity in adulthood; social support from peers, family, or spouse; access to and satisfaction with facilities; enjoyable scenery; and safe neighborhood s. Factors negatively associated with adult physical activity include: advancing age; low income; lack of time; low motivation; rural residency; perception of great effort needed for exercise; overweight or obesity; perception of poor health; and being disabled. Older adults may have additional factors that keep them from being physically active, including lack of social suppor t, lack of transportation to facilities, fear of injury, and cost of programs. Among children ages 4 to 12, the following factors have a positive association with physical activity: gender (boys) ; belief in ability to be active (self -efficacy) ; and parental support . Among adolescents ages 13 to 18, the following factors have a positive association with physical activity: parental edu cation ; gender (boys) ; personal goals ; physical education/school sports ; belief in ability to be active (self -efficacy) ; and support of friends and family. Environmental influences positively associated with physical activity among children and adolescents include: Presence of sidewalks Having a destination/walking to a particular place Access to public transportation Low traffic density Access to neighborhood or school play area and/or recreational equipment People with disabilities may be less likely to participate in physical activity due to physical, emotional, and psychological barriers. Barriers may include the inaccessibility of facilities and the lack of staff trained in working with people with di sabilities. Healthy People 2020 (www.healthypeople .gov) COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 123 Recommended Levels of Physical Activity Adults (age 18 -64) should do 2 hours and 30 minutes a week of moderate -intensity, or 1 hour and 15 minutes (75 minutes) a week of vigorous -intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate - and vigorous -intensity aerobic physical activity. Aerobic activity should be performed in episodes of at least 10 minutes, preferably spread throughout the week. Additional health benefits are provided by increasing to 5 hours (300 minutes) a week of moderate -intensity aerobic physical activity, or 2 hours and 30 minutes a week of vigorous -intensity physical activity, or an equivalent combination of both. Older adults (age 65 and older) should follow the adult guidelines. If this is not possibl e due to limiting chronic conditions, older adults should be as physically active as their abilities allow. They should avoid inactivity. Older adults should do exercise s that maintain or improve balance if they are at risk of falling. For all individuals, some activity is better than none. Physical activity is safe for almost everyone, and the health benefits of physical activity far outweigh the risks. 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. www.heal th.gov/PAGuidelines Physical Activity Levels Leisure -Time Physical Activity.

Hospital Service AreaUS COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 127 Weight Status About Overweight & Obesity Because weight is influenced by energy (calories) consumed and expended, interventions to improve weight can support changes in diet or physical activity. They can help change individuals' knowledge and skills, reduce exposure to foods low in nutritional v alue and high in calories, or increase opportunities for physical activity. Interventions can help prevent unhealthy weight gain or facilitate weight loss among obese people. They can be delivered in multiple settings, including healthcare settings, worksi tes, or schools. The social and physical factors affecting diet and physical activity (see Physical Activity topic area) may also have an impa ct on weight. Obesity is a problem throughout the population. However, among adults, the prevalence is highest fo r middle -aged people and for non -Hispanic black and Mexican American women. Among children and adolescents, the prevalence of obesity is highest among older and Mexican American children and non -Hispanic black girls. The association of income with obesity varies by age, gender, and race/ethnicity. Healthy People 2020 (www.healthypeople.gov) Body Mass Index (BMI), which describes relative weight for height, is significantly correlated with total body fat content. T he BMI should be used to assess overweight and obesity and to monitor changes in body weight. In addition, measurements of body weight alone can be used to determine efficacy of weight loss therapy. BMI is calculated as weight (kg)/height squared (m2). To estimate BMI using pounds and inches, use: [weight (pounds)/height squared (inches2)] x 703. In this report, overweight is defined as a BMI of 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m2 and obesity as a BMI 30 kg/m2. The rationale behind these definitions is based on epidemiological data that show increases in mortality with BMIs above 25 kg/m2. The increase in mortality, however, tends to be modest until a BMI of 30 kg/m2 is reached. F or persons with a BMI 30 kg/m2, mortality rates from all causes, and especially from cardiovascular disease, are generally increased by 50 to 100 percent above that of persons with BMIs in the range of 20 to 25 kg/m2.

Local markets often do not have fruits, vegetables and healthy meat options. Obesity is often intergenerational and therefore behavior and habits are difficult to change . - Community/Business Leade r Our lifestyles. Take a trip to a mall and observe how many fall into the overweight/obese category. Go to a park and compare the number of people being active to the numbers you see in a mall. Look at what we've taken away from school children, recess, modified PE programs. After - school programs focus on academics, and many communities have \"pay to play\" sports programs. Marketing dollars spent by soda companies overwhelm any prevention education budgets . - Health Provider (Non -Physician) The rates of overweight and obesity in our community are high . - Social Services Representative Current studies of BMI in elementary school children places approximately 30% of children as obese . - Public Health Expert High obesity and diabetes rates . - Physician Acce ss to Healthful Foods The poor and low class citizens of the community do not have access to and cannot afford the market prices of fresh fruits and vegetables . - Health Provider (Non -Physician) Nutrition is sorely overlooked when attending to patient's c hronic needs. Lack of resources available for obese children. Many patients are financially unable to provide balanced meals . - Health Provider (Non -Physician) Access to quality food and a basic knowledge about preparing nutritious food . - Health Provider (Non -Physician) Lack of access to high quality, affordable food due to lack of financial resources and lack of quality food retail. Lack of safe physical activity opportunities for community members. Low health/nutrition education. Lack of long -term e xclusive breastfeeding . - Social Services Representative Poverty.

Lack of access to free or low cost recreation. Lack of open spaces. Lack of education. Cultural barriers to diet modification and lack of access to primary care . - Public Health Expert Our communities are not built to support integration o f physical activity into daily life like walking to school, grocery store. Too much reliance on prepared foods. Overweight and obesity are leading risk factors for many of our chronic diseases . - Health Provider (Non -Physician) Socioeconomic Challenges Socio -economic challenges and stressed neighborhoods often make it difficult for residents to engage in healthful physical activity or purchase healthful/fresh foods.

The effects of substance abuse are cumulative, significantly contributing to costly social, physical, mental, and pu blic health problems. These problems include: Teenage pregnancy Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) Other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) Domestic violence Child abuse Motor vehicle crashes Physical fights Crime Homicide Suicide Substance abuse refers to a set of related conditions associated with the consumption of mind - and behavior -altering substances that have negative behavioral and health outcomes. Social attitudes and political and legal responses to the consumption of alcohol and illicit drugs make substance abuse one of the most complex public health issues. In addition to the considerable health implications, substance abuse has been a flash -point in the criminal justice system and a major focal point in discussions about social values: people argue over whether substance abuse is a disease with genetic and biological foundations or a matter of personal choice. Advances in research have led to the development of evidence -based strategies to effectively ad dress substance abuse. Improvements in brain -imaging technologies and the development of medications that assist in treatment have gradually shifted the research community's perspective on substance abuse. There is now a deeper understanding of substance a buse as a disorder that develops in adolescence and, for some individuals, will develop into a chronic illness that will require l ifelong monitoring and care. Improved evaluation of community -level prevention has enhanced researchers' understanding of envi ronmental and social factors that contribute to the initiation and abuse of alcohol and illicit drugs, leading to a more sophisticated understandi ng of how to implement evidence -based strategies in specific social and cultural settings. A stronger emphasis on evaluation has expanded evidence -based practices for drug and alcohol treatment. Improvements have focused on the development of better clinical interventions through research and increasing the skills and qualification s of treatment providers.

Scient ific knowledge about the health effects of tobacco use has increased greatly since the first Surgeon General's report on tobacco was released in 1964. Tobacco use causes: Cancer Heart disease Lung diseases (including emphysema, bronchitis, and chronic ai rway obstruction) Premature birth, low birth weight, stillbirth, and infant death There is no risk -free level of exposure to secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke causes heart disease and lung cancer in adults and a number of health problems in infants and c hildren, including: severe asthma attacks; respiratory infections; ear infections; and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Smokeless tobacco causes a number of serious oral health problems, including cancer of the mouth and gums, periodontitis, and tooth loss. Cigar use causes cancer of the larynx, mouth, esophagus, and lung.

People who stop smoking greatly reduce their risk of disease and premature death. Benefits are greater for people who stop at earlier ages, but quitting tobacco use is beneficial at any age. Many factors influence tobacco use, disease, and mortality. Risk factors include race/ethnicity, age, education, and socioeconomic status. Significant disparities in tobacco use exist geographically; such disparities typically result from differences among states in smoke -free protections, tobacco prices, and program funding for tobacco prevention.

People with a usual source of care have better health outcomes and fewer disparities and costs. Having a primary care provider (PCP) as the usual source of care is especially important. PCPs can develop meaningful and sustained relationships with patients and provide integrated services while practicing in the context of family and community. Having a usual PCP is associated with: Greater pati ent trust in the provider Good patient -provider communication Increased likelihood that patients will receive appropriate care Improving health care services includes increasing access to and use of evidence -based preventive services. Clinical preventive s ervices are services that: prevent illness by detecting early warning signs or symptoms before they develop into a disease (primary prevention); or detect a disease at an earlier, and often more treatable, stage (secondary prevention).

Good oral health improves a person's ability to speak, smile, smell, taste, touch, chew, swallow, and make facial expressions to show feelings and emotions. However, oral diseases, from cavities to oral cancer, cause pain and disability for many American s. Good self -care, such as brushing with fluoride toothpaste, daily flossing, and professional treatment, is key to good oral health. Health behaviors that can lead to poor oral health include: tobacco use; excessive alcohol use; and poor dietary choices . The significant improvement in the oral health of Americans over the past 50 years is a public health success story. Most of the gains are a result of effective prevention and treatment efforts. One major success is community water fluoridation, which no w benefits about 7 out of 10 Americans who get water through public water systems. However, some Americans do not have access to preventive programs. People who have the least access to preventive services and dental treatment have greater rates of oral dis eases. A person's ability to access oral healthcare is associated with factors such as education level, income, race, and ethnicity. Barriers that can limit a person's use of preventive interventions and treatments include: limited access to and availabil ity of dental services; lack of awareness of the need for care; cost; and fear of dental procedures. There are also social determinants that affect oral health. In general, people with lower levels of education and income, and people from specific racial/ ethnic groups, have higher rates of disease. People with disabilities and other health conditions, like diabetes, are more likely to have poor oral health. Potential strategies to address these issues include: Implementing and evaluating activities that h ave an impact on health behavior. Promoting interventions to reduce tooth decay, such as dental sealants and fluoride use. Evaluating and improving methods of monitoring oral diseases and conditions. Increasing the capacity of State dental health programs to provide preventive oral health services. Increasing the number of community health centers with an oral health component.
