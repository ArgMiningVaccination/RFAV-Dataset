This section covers some of the basic facts about advanced renal cell cancer and why your health care provider may have prescribed VOTRIENT\u00ae (pazopanib) tablets to treat it. About advanced kidney cancer Kidney cancer occurs when cells start to grow out of control in the kidney. Sometimes these kidney cancer cells spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body. Even though the cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body, your health care provider will still call it kidney cancer because that is where the cancer cells started. Why VOTRIENT\u00ae (pazopanib) tablets? VOTRIENT is used to treat adults with advanced renal cell cancer, a form of kidney cancer. VOTRIENT may shrink or slow the growth of kidney cancer for a period of time. VOTRIENT is not a cure for kidney cancer. TAKING VOTRIENTIf you are in the advanced stages of kidney cancer, your health care provider may decide that VOTRIENT may be a treatment option for you. VOTRIENT is a prescription medicine in tablet form that you take by mouth. It is not known if VOTRIENT is safe and effective in children under 18 years of age. VOTRIENT can cause serious liver problems, including death. Your health care provider will do blood tests to check your liver before you start\u2014and while you take\u2014VOTRIENT. How VOTRIENT may work VOTRIENT is not a chemotherapy drug. VOTRIENT works to prevent the growth of new blood vessels to the tumor and may shrink or slow the growth of the cancer by stopping a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor or VEGF (vehj eff). VEGF is important for the growth of blood vessels to supply nutrients to the tumor cell. It is important to note that VOTRIENT may also harm healthy cells.
