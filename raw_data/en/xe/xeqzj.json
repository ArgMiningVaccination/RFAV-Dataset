Monkeypox A Randomized, Placebo -Controlled, Double -Blinded Trial of the Safety and Efficacy of Tecovirimat for the Treatment of Persons with Human Monkeypox Virus Disease Study of Tecovirimat for Human Monkey pox Virus (STOMP) SPONSOR: NIH/AIDS CLINICAL TRIALS GROUPA5418Background We are experiencing multicountry outbreak of human monkeypox virus (HMPXV) Disease is often spread sexually with rectal, genital and oral ulcers occurring commonly Pain due to proctitis is a new feature and particularly common Tecovirimat is a promising treatment for HMPXV disease Indicated for the treatment of human smallpox disease Works by inhibiting viral p 37 protein (highly conserved in orthopoxvirus es) and blocks its interaction with cellular Rab9 GTPase and TIP47, preventing the formation of egress - competent enveloped virions Safety and efficacy data are lacking for HMPXV Tecovirimat is being used through CDC EA -IND and community demand for treatment is high Other tecovirimat studies for HMPXV PALM -007: randomized, double -blind, controlled trial of tecovirimat for HMPXV to be conducted in the Democratic Republic of Congo (n=450) Patients hospitalized for duration of treatment; different clade than current epidemic PLATINUM: a randomized, double -blind controlled trial of tecovirimat for HMPXV to be conducted in the UK (n=500) Conducted remotely Canadian trial (details unknown) WHO/ANRS trial: 6 yrsand old; platform trial; time to complete resolution All trials are evaluating same dose of tecovirimat, sampling of various compartments for HMPXV Unique features of A5418 rectal sampling, cross -over to tecovirimat for progression or severe pain, 2:1 allocation ratio, enrollment of presumptive HMPXV, earlier in course of disease, structure pain assessmentStudy Summary Design and Sample size2:1 Randomized, Blinded, Placebo -controlled (n=530) Intensively sampled subset (n=100) Open label for children, persons with pregnancy or severe disease, severe immune suppression or severe skin disease (n 250) Study Population Symptomatic HMPXV infection (greater than 3 kg) Design Superiority 10Outcome Time to clinical resolution Duration 57 days Enrollment period 8 weeks Agent Weight based oral TecovirimatHypothesis 10Objective and endpointTecovirimat will lead to faster clinical resolution of HMPXV disease compared to placebo. To compare time to clinical resolution between people with HMPXV randomized to tecovirimat or placebo. Clinical resolution is when all skin lesions are scabbed over, desquamated, or healed and all visible mucosal lesions healed Step 1: daily self skin checks and photographs Step 2: participant reports clinical resolution Step 3: video visit to confirm clinical resolution Step 4: confirmation at in person visitA5418 Population EligibilityOutpatients (> 3 kg ) with: Confirmed or presumptive disease (oral, rectal, or skin lesion) Presumptive diagnosis with compatible skin or mucosal lesions or proctitis in cisgender men or transgender women with sexual contact with 1 or more cismen or transwomen in 14 days prior to symptom onset or people with exposure to another person with known HMPXV. Onset of symptoms of HMPXV infection 14 days prior to randomization, At least one active, (not yet scabbed) skin lesion, mouth lesion or proctitis with or without visible ulcers Randomization restricted to those 18 years or older without one of the following conditions Those with severe disease (ocular involvement, hospitalization, deep lesions requiring surgical intervention, potentially disfiguring lesions on the face), pregnant and breastfeeding people, and those with severe immunodeficiency, severe inflammatory skin conditions, children are in open -label cohort.Key 20 ObjectivesTo compare pain scores between randomized arms. To compare rates of progression to severe HMPX disease between randomized arms. To compare clearance of HMPXV between randomized arms in various compartments including blood, skin lesions, oropharynx, rectum, and genital secretions. To compare time to complete lesion healing between randomized arms. To compare participant -reported outcomes including adherence and EQ - 5D-5L between randomized arms. To evaluate the safety of tecovirimat as compared to placebo.

Unclassified/For Public Use 37 UnclassifiedUpdates: PaxlovidUnclassified/For Public Use 38 UnclassifiedCDC Interim Clinical Considerations for COVID -19 Treatment in Outpatients See: Interim Clinical Considerations for Covid -19 Treatment in OutpatientsThere is strong scientific evidence that antiviral treatment of outpatients at risk for severe COVID -19 reduces their risk of hospitalization and death. The antiviral drugs Paxlovid (ritonavir -boosted nirmatrelvir )andVeklury (remdesivir) are the preferred treatments for eligible adult and pediatric patients with positive results of direct SARS -CoV- 2 viral testing and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID -19. Clinicians should consider COVID -19 treatment in non -hospitalized patients who meet all of the following: oTest positive for SARS -CoV-2 (with PCR or antigen test, including at -home tests) oHave symptoms consistent with mild-to-moderate COVID -19. People with mild COVID -19 experience symptoms such as fever, sore throat, cough, or headache that do not affect the lungs and breathing. People with moderate illness have symptoms that affect the lungs like shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. oAre within 5 days of symptom onset for Paxlovid or 7 days of symptom onset for Veklury oHave one or more risk factors for severe COVID -19What You Need to Know:Unclassified/For Public Use 39 UnclassifiedCDC Underlying Medical Conditions Associated with Higher Risk for Severe COVID -19 Risk factors for severe COVID -19 include: oAge over 50 years, with risk increasing substantially at age 65 years oBeing unvaccinated or not being up to date on COVID -19 vaccinations oSpecific medical conditions and behaviors Some people from racial and ethnic minority groups are at risk of being disproportionately affected by COVID -19 due to many factors, including limited access to vaccines and healthcare. Healthcare providers can consider these factors when evaluating the risk for severe COVID -19 and use of outpatient therapeutics.

Kaiser Permanente Southern California, December 23, 2021 -May 21, 2022 Demographics: 5,287 patients 12 years received 5 -day Paxlovid treatment. Median age was 61. 92% had received at least one COVID -19 vaccine dose; 72.5% received at least 3 doses, 8% unvaccinated. Key Findings: 6 hospitalizations and 39 ED encounters related to SARS -CoV-2 infection. Hospitalizations and ED encounters for COVID -19 related illness 5 -15 days after Paxlovid dispensation occurred <1% of all patients. When administered as an early -stage treatment, Paxlovid might prevent COVID -19-related hospitalization among persons with mild to moderate COVID -19 cases who are at risk for progression to severe disease .

This study showed that among non -hospitalized, unvaccinated patients at high risk of progression to severe disease, treatment with Paxlovid reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 88%. Observational data, including vaccinated patients, from Israel1, United States2,and Hong Kong3is consistent with benefit in high -risk patients: o67% reduction in hospitalizations and 81% reduction in deaths compared to the untreated for patients over 651 o45% reduction in hospitalization and greater reductions for obese or unvaccinated patients among adult patients2 o75% reduction in death compared to non -users3.

Paxlovid treatment helps prevent hospitalization and death due to COVID -19. COVID -19 rebound has been reported to occur between 2 and 8 days after initial recovery and is characterized by a recurrence of COVID -19 symptoms or a new positive viral test after having tested negative. A brief return of symptoms may be part of the natural history of SARS -CoV-2(the virus that causes COVID - 19) infection in some persons, independent of treatment with Paxlovid and regardless of vaccination status . Limited information currently available from case reports suggests that persons treated with Paxlovid who experience COVID -19 rebound have had mild illness; there are no reports of severe disease.
