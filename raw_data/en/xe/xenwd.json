American Journal of Public Health, 104(S4), S532 -S534. Thank you. We did look closely at this study, particularly because of the paucity of research examining the prevalence of health disparities in LGBT Veterans. Upon review, we determined that the study did not meet inclusion criteria based on lack comparison data.

If applicable, please indicate the page and line numbers from the draft report. 1 Page 5, lines 29 -33: Clarify that these are the 3 key questions Thank you. We have added numbers for clarity. 1 Page 7, lines 3 -6; page 18 line 10 and figure: Discrepancy - 415 studies in text in multiple places, 455 in figure 2. Clarify if there is overlap with more than one key question addressed by some studies. Thank you. We have changed Figure 2 to accurately reflect the total number of studies, with a note about studies addressing multiple key questions. 1 Page 7, line 52; page 35, line 30: What 3 disparity classifications are being referred to - are these the 3 key questions? In the original draft, this referred to the classification of findings (disparity, no disparity, mixed/unclear). We have edited these sentences for clarity. 1 Page 8, lines 7 -9; page 35, lines 43 -45: \"Missing completely were studies designed to address disparities related to LGBT identify\" ADD \", and studies were sparse in other areas, eg , interventions to address racial/ethnic, sex, and disability -associated disparities.\" Added, thank you. 1 Page 9, line 40: Is citation 4 a VA ESP evidence brief? Please add complete details to the citation listing. Yes, it is an evidence brief. Thank you. We have updated the reference. 1 Page 9, line 49: Citation 5 is not the direct source of the statistic that is cited. I suggest substituting for citation 5 the report or website this is quoted in the Study of Barriers to Care for Women Veterans repo rt (it likely comes from the VetPop population projections). Thank you. We have updated the report to reflect VetPop2014 projections published in the NCVAS February 2017 Women Veterans Report. 1 Page 11, lines 38 -41: Labelling the key questions will mak e it easier to follow. We have added numbers to improve readability. 1 Page 12, lines 23 -34: Some studies may describe previously unstudied disparities (1st gen) and also examine mediating factors (2nd gen). How are these studies categorized? If categorized as 2nd gen, then a limitation of this evidence map is that those studies do not contribute to key question 1, and that limitation should be added. We included all studies meeting inclusion criteria that provided data on the prevalence of health disparities (1st gen) for KQ1, regardless of whether they also examined mediating factors (2nd gen). We have added the following statement to clarify: Some studies may fall into more than one generational category. In these cases, only the data relevant t o the key questions in this report were extracted. 1 Page 13: It seems that the \"2nd\" and \"3rd\" circles should be in -line with the arrows containing \"KQ 3\" and \"KQs 2 and 3\", respectively. Thank you. We have made these edits. 1 Pages 13 & 28: \"patie nt-provider\" is a mediating factor in the figure 1 analytic framework, but it is missing as a category in the figure 10 intervention evidence map. That category should be added to the evidence map so that it is clear that there are no studies that fit in t hat category (assuming that is the case). If those studies are categorized in a different way in the map, then a footnote should be added to the analytic framework specifying where to find those studies. For KQ2, the intervention categories we mapped were not intended to align directly with the types of mediating factors in the analytic framework. Instead, our map is organized by the focus of the intervention. This allowed us to highlight technology interventions. Health Disparities in Veterans: A Map of the Evidence Evidence- based Synthesis Program 82 1 Page 16, table 2: Study sites - Clarify how national samples ( eg, BRFSS, SHEP) are categorized. Sample size - this scoring biases against studies of small populations within VA ( eg, certain race groups and women). That bias should be explicitly stated. Thank you. We edited the language in Table 2 to reflect one point for multi -site studies and data from national samples. With regard to bias, you are correct that if we were using sample size as a measure of confidence across populations, small samples would be at a disadvantage. However, our confidence scores are presented in a way that they are only relevant within each population (i.e., for each population, including each racial and ethnic group, we present separate tables with study- level confidence scores, and maps with mean confidence scores represented by bubble size by outcome type/finding). In addition, we prioritized conveying the relative differences, rather than the absolute sizes. To clarify, we have added a statement in our discussion/limitations. 1 Page 32, table 5: Other than the first 2 rows, the studies appear to be listed alphabetically by title. The table would be much more useful if studies were ordered by disparity type, with studies addressing more than one disparity type grouped together at either the top or bottom of the table. Thank you. We have re -organized the table based on your suggestion. 2 Fine job to the authors! Thank you for the opportunity to review Prevalence of and Interventions to Reduce Disparities in Vulnerable Populations within the VA: A Map of the Evidence. I agree with the report's authors in that this product sheds a light on available disparity research and areas ripe for action by VA researchers, program offices, and stakeholders. I offer several comments for consideration. However, and because a lot of the report focuses on maps, I do have specific comments regarding the maps. Visually, I think it is important to list the mean confidence level in the bubbles. Additionally, I am curious about studies classified as mixed/unclear. This may be misleading and I give an example of a study that I am familiar with that was included in the study. I am available to provide additional details as needed. Thank you. 2 Page 5 Line 8 - The use of the term \"diverse\" is broad. Suggest qualifying diverse in ter ms in race, gender, etc. to bring additional focus that health equity involves addressing issues for groups that have experience inequalities and inequities, historical and contemporary injustices, and other types of marginalization. Thank you. We have rev ised the introductory paragraph to be more specific. 2 Page 5 Line 14 - Suggest referencing the VHA Health Equity Action Plan as it outlines VHA's strategic plan to eliminate health disparities/achieve health equity specifically. Thank you. The introduct ions of both the Executive Summary and the Evidence Report now refer to the VHA Health Equity Plan. Health Disparities in Veterans: A Map of the Evidence Evidence- based Synthesis Program 83 2 Page 5 Line 22 - I would reference partnering with the nominating partner (OHE). For example, other ESPs included the following language: In order to guide future research and policy decisions for the VA, the VA Office of Heath Equity partnered with the Evidence- based Synthesis Program (ESP)... Thank you. Yes, absolutely. We have edited the statement accordingly. 2 Page 5 Line 23 - Modify to \"health d isparities affecting vulnerable Veterans\" Thank you. We have added \"vulnerable\" to this sentence. 2 Page 5 Line 49 - Suggest changing \"all\" to \"select\" as the review does not capture \"all Veteran populations for whom a health disparity might exist.\" We have changed \"all\" to \"select.\" 2 Line 6 Line 12 - Consider alternate word other than \"pearled.\" We have changed \"pearled\" to \"manually searched.\" 2 Page 6 Line 45 - Was a threshold used for the number that had to be in agreement? For example, if 90% of the findings are in agreement classifying the study as mixed may cause undue confusion about the evidence in the article. No, we did not use a threshold for agreement. Because we classified studies into outcome categories (i.e., utilization, quality, an d patient health) a single study may have provided data for more than one category. For example, a hypothetical study may have found no evidence of a disparity in utilization, but may have found evidence of a disparity in the quality of care. Within each outcome category, given the range of clinical areas and the vast number of studies, we were unable to extract the amount of data required to make clinically informed judgements for each study, and did not want to arbitrary cutoffs based on percentages which may be misleading (for example, no disparity may have been identified for the vast majority of outcomes examined, but was identified for the primary outcome of interest). In general, if possible, we aligned our finding with findings of the primary outcomes. However, if a study had multiple primary outcomes of interest ( eg, a study of Veterans with diabetes may examine HbA1c testing, HbA1c control, blood pressure testing, blood pressure control, LDL -C testing, LDL -C control), we classified the finding as mixed/unclear if any disagreement existed. 2 Page 7 Line 8 - Suggest restating Key Question for those who may only read the executive summary. Thank you. We have added the key questions to this section. 2 Page 7 Line 14 - What about military era, SES or any other target populations that not included? Thank you. Instead of adding additional text outlining our findings for each population, we have added maps/figures. 2 Page 7 Line 36 - Suggest restating this sentence. Thank you. We have restated this sentence for clarity. 2 Page 7 Line 59 - This paragraph doesn't reflect what is stated in the prior paragraph. Suggest adding Veterans with memberships in multiple vulnerable groups (although the maps may not convey this fully). Thank you. We have restat ed these paragraphs. 2 Page 8 Line 25 - Strike \"of the\" in \"They inform of the areas\" Thank you , \"of the\" has been removed. Health Disparities in Veterans: A Map of the Evidence Evidence- based Synthesis Program 84 2 Page 9 Line 3 - Aforementioned comments in Executive Summary apply to ongoing section as well. Thank you. Where applicable, we have applied previous comments to the full report. 2 Page 9 Line 50 - Spell out OEF/OIF if first time used. Thank you, we have corrected this. 2 Page 10 Line 26 - Strike Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and the parens before and after OEF and OIF. OEF and OIF previously used. See prior comment. Thank you, we have corrected this. 2 Page 11 Line 27 - I recommend including the nominating partner. Other reviews have included the following language...\"In order to guide future research and policy decisions for the VA, the VA Office of Heath Equity partnered with the Evidence -based Synthesis Program (ESP)...\" Thank you. We apologize for this oversight. We have added the recommended language. 2 Page 12 Line 6 - The topic was developed in collaboration with VHA Office of Health Equity. I would mention that. Thank you. We apologize for this oversight. We have added reference to the Office of Health Equity to the Topic Development section of Methods. 2 Page 13 Line 23 - Are the Veteran populations listed according to some order? I'd suggest listing alphabetically or according to evidence of disparity according to key questions. Thank you. We have alphabetized the list. 2 Page 14 Line 38 - Identify stakeholder We have changed \"our stak eholder\" to \"Dr. Uchendu.\" 2 Page 16 Line 3 - Is there a citation to support this approach? Unfortunately, there is not. Previous evidence maps have focused largely on systematic reviews, and have reported the quality ratings assigned by those reviews. B ecause we examined over 400 primary studies, we were unable to, due to time constraints, perform a formal evaluation of the quality of evidence. We chose these variables to represent a rough estimate of confidence. 2 Page 20 Line 7 - LGB and Transgender are separate but I believe in all other prior cases LGBT studies were lumped together. Should these be combined? Thank you. In the draft report, we separated the one study examining transgender Veterans from those examining lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) Veterans to highlight the paucity of research on this population. We understand that it may be confusing, considering we grouped them with studies examining lesbian, gay, and bisexual Veterans for the rest of the report. We have edited the map to reflect studies examining LGBT veterans, consistent with the rest of the report, and have noted in the figure footer that only one study examined transgender Veterans. Health Disparities in Veterans: A Map of the Evidence Evidence- based Synthesis Program 85 2 Page 21 Line 20 - I am not sure but I think the bubbles, visually, would be easier to unders tand if the confidence level (number) was included in each bubble. Thank you. We considered including confidence estimates on the maps. We decided not to include the numerical values, considering that the bubbles represent mean confidence estimates, that the differences between bubbles on most maps were relatively small (and were noticeable when large), and we did not want to add potentially distracting visual information. Study- level confidence estimates are provided for each map (Appendices E -R). 2 Page 162 Line 45 - Study found disparities in all 10 mental health diagnoses and 14/17 medical diagnoses. I point this out as an example of how the \"mixed/unclear\" category can be misleading for studies with multiple outcomes. Yes, this is a good example. Thi s particular study examined outcomes related to utilization, quality, and health outcomes. We classified diagnoses as health outcomes, and did determine that the findings were \"mixed/unclear.\" As mentioned above, we tried to align our determination with pr imary outcomes, and we tried to, if possible, base our determination on the results authors chose to highlight in the abstract. This particular study's abstract stated, \"Multivariate analyses found few differences between homeless and non -homeless ED users on the medical conditions examined, but homeless ED users were more likely to have been diagnosed with a drug use disorder...alcohol use disorder..., or schizophrenia in the past year. We determined that the findings were mixed, given the presence of disparit ies related to substance use disorders and schizophrenia, but few differences in medical conditions. 3 The authors have done a very impressive job bringing together an enormous number of studies to address these important Key Questions. The review is well organized, straightforward, and easy to follow. The evidence maps are very well done and convey information clearly. There are some minor stylistic issues that would make the report a bit easier to follow, and some conceptual issues of more significant concern. Thank you. 3 In the executive summary would be helpful if the Key Questions were clearly laid out for those readers who will not read the full -length report. Although there is a brief mention of how authors defined study outcome categories of \"utilization\", \"quality\", and \"health outcome\", a more detailed explanation of these terms would help the reader better understand their classification system, and to ascertain the evidence available in each area. Additionally, briefly providing those definitions with each map would allow the reader to continue through the report without having to go back and forth. Thank you. To better highlight the key questions in the executive summary, we have added numbers to the introduction, and included each key question in full in the results section. In addition, we have added examples to expand our description of our study outcome categories, and include the statement, \"Quality of care studies included processes of care, intermediate outcomes, and patient evaluations of care\" in the footer of each relevant map. Health Disparities in Veterans: A Map of the Evidence Evidence- based Synthesis Program 86 3 It is unclear what is meant by some statements, particularly those later in the report. For example, the statement, \"Mean confidence estimates for African American/Black Veterans and to a certain extent Hispanic/Latino Veterans, were lower than for other g roups, given a much larger literature base, and regression toward the mean,\" seems to include several ideas that might be more clear if teased apart or rephrased. Thank you. We have rephrased this statement for clarity. 3 There are 3 conceptual issues t hat the authors should consider. First, by reporting study authors' conclusions regarding the presence or absence of a disparity, the authors are tacitly agreeing with the studies' findings. While it may be tempting to provide policy makers with quick summ aries of the literature, providing a \"rough estimate of confidence for each study\" gives the impression that study quality is evaluated and that a firm conclusion exists when this is not the case. Factors that could impact determinations of the presence or absence of a disparity include appropriateness of confounders, biases in sampling, quality and appropriateness of the outcome measures used, and types of analyses and adjustments employed. These limitations are not trivial and should be acknowledged. Thank you. Although we made our own determinations of whether study findings represented a disparity, you are absolutely correct that we are taking studies on face value, without formal evaluations of study quality. Our intention was never that our finding s be used as a basis from which to guide policy, but instead, the hope is that it will serve a tool used to inform future research. We have edited our conclusion, with more emphasis on this point. 3 Second, in addition to ignoring limitations of the \"ro ugh confidence estimate\", the evidence maps for Key Question 1 do not consider whether a statistically significant finding reflects a minimally important difference or whether an or insignificant finding occurs due to insufficient power. For example, Appendix I presents the Evidence Map for Hawaiian and Pacific Islander Veterans. The absence of findings is most likely due to the fact that the numbers of Veterans identifying as HPI are very low, even in large scale studies. This is particularly problematic i n studies in which outcomes are low frequency events. Given that this is a very understudied group of Veterans, and it seems premature to convey the impression that no disparities exist for these groups (or any other). This should also be acknowledged in a more detailed limitations section, but perhaps summarizing studies identified for Key Question 1 in a manner similar as was done for Key Question 2 would be more appropriate. Thank you. You are absolutely correct that findings of no difference in populations such as Native Hawaiians, may be due to a lack of statistical power. We have included a statement to this point in the body of the report, as well as in the discussion, and included a call for targeted research examining these smaller groups. With re ga rd to summarizing Key Question 1 in a manner more similar to Key Question 2 -- We identified 358 studies for Key Question 1, and 64 studies for Key Question 2. The goal of Key Question 1 was to provide an overview of the prevalence of disparities, and the studies examining disparities, for a broad range of populations. Instead of providing study and outcome - level detail for each population, which would have dramatically increased the length of the report, we focused on largest populations within the body of the report, and provided maps and tables for all populations in the appendices. In addition, the 2 questions were very different. For Key Question 2, the focus was the interventions designed to mitigate disparities; thus, we were able to organize our results by type of intervention. However, for Key Question 1, the focus was prevalence. Given that the mechanisms through which disparities occur are likely different by Veteran population, we chose to organize our maps and our findings by population, rather than by type of outcome. Health Disparities in Veterans: A Map of the Evidence Evidence- based Synthesis Program 87 3 Finally, the authors appropriately note the paucity of studies evaluating possible disparities for LGBT Veterans. However, numerous understudied areas exist that are not acknowledged. For example, despite numerous studies examining lung, prostate and color ectal cancers, none evaluated possible disparities in the prevalence, treatment or outcomes of Veterans with breast cancer or melanoma. Moreover, there is an absence of studies on subgroups of Veteran populations of interest (e.g, Asian women veterans). Clearly, it is unreasonable to expect that all areas in which there is limited or no information will be mentioned; however, it would seem reasonable to acknowledge that the current evidence base is more limited than is suggested by the authors. Thank you. Due to the number of studies we identified and our time limitations, we broadly categorized studies by clinical area, but did not examine the frequencies of specific conditions. Similarly, we did not have the bandwidth to examine disparities related to the intersecting identities of Veterans belonging to multiple vulnerable populations. The maps presented here are meant to provide a high -level overview, and to inform future research, including systematic reviews. Future population specific systematic review s (women) should include an examination of both subgroups of interest (eg, racial/ethnic minorities, sexual orientation, age, etc.) and clinical areas. We have added these limitations and recommendations to the report. 3 The findings for Key Question 2 are concise and well written. This section has similar limitations as the section covering Key Question 1. The results of Key Question 3 are clearly presented and well summarized. This report will be extremely helpful for policy makers in ORD. Thank you. 4 The report is very good. It was a big undertaking, and the authors should be commended on their work. Thank you. 4 There are a couple of typos in the executive summary (an additional space in line 10, page 7; 'studies' repeated in line 16, page 7). Thank you, we have corrected these errors. 4 There are 2 aspects I'd suggest adding, if only in the conclusions section. First would be some kind of context. While it is true that most studies on disparities have evaluated race and gender and rurality/distance to care, these probably represent a relatively high proportion of minorities. It would be helpful to know the prevalence of the LGBT population in the veteran population to be able to contextualize the degree to which studies addressing p otential disparities therein might be feasible to do. Thank you. You are correct. We have added LGBT Veteran estimates to the introduction/background. In addition, we have added a statement to the conclusion referencing both the small number of LGBT Veterans and the Don't Ask Don't Tell Repeal Act, which took effect midway through our search period. 4 Second, it may be that VA disparities are offset or worsened by non -VA care (where most veterans - even VA users - get healthcare. For instance, we found t hat minority VA enrollees who used private sector care for CABG went to lower quality private sector hospitals, even though higher quality ones were frequently closer to where they lived ( Weeks WB, Fisher ES. Characteristics of VA patients who use low quality private sector CABG centers in New York. Medical Care Research and Review 2007; 64(6):691 -705. PMID: 17878291.) Thank you. We have added a statement that we did not stratify or analyze studies by site of care; thus, are unable to differentiate between care received at the VHA and the private sector. In addition, we have included a statement emphasizing the need for future research examining disparities by site of care.
