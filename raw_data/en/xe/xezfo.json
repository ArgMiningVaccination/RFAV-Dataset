[Visit INSIDER's homepage for more stories.](https://www.insider.com/) In the age of both stress and wellness, it's no surprise that essential oils \u2014 fragrant plant-derived oils touted as stress-relievers and holistic cure-alls \u2014 have exploded in popularity. A new INSIDER poll found that just over a third of Americans believe in the health benefits of essential oils. Likewise, 31% of respondents said they believe in aromatherapy, a pseudoscientific practice predicated on smelling aromatic substances, including essential oils, in order to improve overall well-being. The [poll](https://www.insider.com/here-are-the-unproven-theories-americans-believe-in-the-most-2019-7) asked over a thousand respondents, \"If any, which of the following unproven ideas, paranormal phenomena or general beliefs do you believe to be credible?,\" allowing survey-takers to select from a list of 15 choices, including options like \"The health benefits of aromatherapy\" and \"The efficacy of crystal healing,\" as well as \"None of these.\" Two-thirds of those who believe in essential oils were female, and most were middle-class or lower-income. Nearly 40% were aged 45-60, and over a quarter were millennials. Watch: Turkish dessert is deep-fried and soaked in syrup Essential oils have been praised by celebrities from [Kelly Clarkson](https://twitter.com/kellyclarkson/status/793513530855129088) and [RuPaul](https://twitter.com/rupaul/status/834547909899100160?lang=en) \u2014 and everyone seems to have a high school acquaintance who's slinging products for multi-level marketing companies that sell essential oils. Jonathan Jarry, a biological scientist and science communicator at McGill University, told INSIDER that much of the science cited by essential oil evangelists is poorly done. \"There are over 28,000 scientific journals in existence, so if you want to find someone to publish a bad study, it's not difficult,\" Jarry said.

If a product is said to \"support cardiovascular health,\" consumers might extrapolate to think it means \"lowers blood pressure\" or \"prevents heart attacks,\" Jarry explained. It's also occasionally outright misleading. In 2014, the FDA issued warning letters to popular essential oil companies, such as [Young Living](https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/young-living-09222014) and [doTERRA](https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/doterra-international-llc-09222014), for using specious marketing to sell their products \u2014 including claims regarding their oils' effectiveness in [preventing or treating](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2014/09/24/fda-warns-three-companies-against-marketing-their-products-as-ebola-treatments-or-cures/) the deadly Ebola virus. Nonetheless, the market for essential oils is on a swift upward trajectory. According to market research firm Statista, the global market value of the industry is expected to [increase](https://www.statista.com/topics/5174/essential-oils/) from $17 billion in 2017 to $27 billion in 2022. In the US, the essential oils market is [estimated](https://www.statista.com/statistics/742159/us-essential-oils-market-value/) to increase from $4.7 billion in 2019 to $7.3 billion in 2024. The promise of a natural treatment free from side-effects is enticing \u2014 but without rigorous research backing corporate claims, scientists are reluctant to sanction the use of essential oils. \"Interventions need to be properly tested before they can be endorsed,\" Jarry told INSIDER. \"Just because you feel a little bit better smelling lavender for half an hour does not mean any underlying clinical problem is being treated.\" Read more: [Most 'wellness' treatments are bogus \u2014 here are the ones that actually help your body](https://www.insider.com/spa-health-treatments-work-science-2017-8) [Few supplements have proven heart benefits](https://www.insider.com/few-supplements-have-proven-heart-benefits-2019-7) [A new investigation says Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop has made "}
