One is how viruses are named. Another is how ubiquitous they are. President Donald Trump calls the virus that causes COVID-19 the \"China virus.\" Judge for yourself whether that's a racist appellation, but from a medical perspective, it's useless. It's similar to calling every sport played with a ball in the United States the \"American game.\" If you want to learn the rules of NFL football, or how to score doubles tennis, Googling the \"American game\" won't help you figure it out. Specificity matters, in sports and in science. Viruses are bits of DNA or RNA wrapped in a protein coat. In nature, they can only replicate inside the living cells of a host organism. There are trillions and trillions of different viruses, most of which don't infect humans and have not yet been detected or described. Many viruses mutate frequently, so they're constantly evolving into new strains. When researchers isolate a previously unknown virus, they sequence sections of its genetic material and compare the result to known viruses. Eventually, they assign the new virus a position in a hierarchy of viruses, similar to the animal kingdom \"Tree of Life\" diagram that kids often memorize in high school biology. [What you need to know about coronavirus](/news/public-health/2020/03/03/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-coronavirus/) The taxonomy, or classification, of viruses is important because it provides clues about how viruses evolve and, sometimes, where to start the search for diagnostic tests, vaccines and treatments. It also can help researchers better understand the global distribution of viruses and which ones are more likely to trigger human pandemics. The first, fully sequenced strain of virus from the current pandemic is SARS-CoV-2/Hu-1/Human/2019/Wuhan_NC_045512. That official name starts with the species, Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related virus, identifies the host, where and when it was first isolated. The code at the end, NC_045512, is a database link to its complete genetic information. That technical name is a mouthful. But is it really much more cumbersome than the titles of some football games, such as the Bad Boy Mowers Gasparilla Bowl at Raymond James Stadium, or some federal legislation, such as the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act? \"We're trying to sum up 30,000 nucleotides of information in as few words as possible,\" said Benjamin Neuman, professor and chairman of Biological Sciences at Texas A&M University-Texarkana. \"There's no particular relevance of using Wuhan in the [common] name; it's embedded in a very long, specific strand of information. The only way it makes sense to talk about this virus is SARS-CoV-2.\" In other words, SARS-CoV-2 is a reasonably accurate nickname to use when discussing the virus that causes the human disease COVID-19. It's certainly more informative than \"China virus.\" An accurate name offers clarity. It can sound a warning. The first identified SARS virus, SARS-CoV, caused a disease outbreak in 2002-03 that spread to more than two dozen countries within a few months and killed one of every 10 people it infected. SARS-CoV-2, a relative of that first virus, is worse. And SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be merely the latest, not the last, coronavirus with the potential to jump to humans. In a study published in 2017, researchers reported isolating 100 different coronaviruses after sampling about 19,000 bats, rodents, nonhuman primates and humans in high-risk areas on three continents. Another study found, in a Ugandan bat, a novel coronavirus similar to MERS-CoV, which can cause severe respiratory disease in humans. And coronaviruses are just one kind of virus. There are filoviruses, such members of the genus Ebolavirus. My personal terror is the genus Orthohantavirus. One species in this group, eventually christened Sin nombre (\"without a name\"), was first isolated in the U.S. desert Southwest in the early 1990s. It normally resides in deer mice, which shed the virus in their urine and feces. People can become infected when they inhale dust contaminated with mouse droppings or dried urine. Sin Nombre Orthohantavirus kills one out of every three people it infects. I thought about that hantavirus while I helped clean out my grandparents' cluttered carport in Las Cruces, N.M., after my grandmother died. If I'd developed raging pneumonia a week later, I wouldn't have told doctors that I might have been infected with the \"American virus.\" I would have used the most specific name I knew at that time: hantavirus. That name would have helped physicians understand what we were up against. We are fighting a pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. Politicians can call it \"China virus,\" or they can call it Bob or Jane or Archibald if they want, but that won't help save lives. Calling it by the correct name might.
