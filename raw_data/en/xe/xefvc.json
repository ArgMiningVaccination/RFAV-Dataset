Whenever Im working with a new client who is trying to figure out an IAQ issue in their home, I'll suggest the use of a Home Air Check test kit. Able to measure VOC's, formaldehyde and active mold, these kits are an invaluable asset, giving us quick and accurate numbers at a very affordable price. We have been working with Sarah Mack and her team for many years and Im excited to discuss their process, how they developed these kits and whats on the testing horizon for Enthalpy.
