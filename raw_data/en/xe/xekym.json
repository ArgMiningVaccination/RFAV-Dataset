The substances constituting food supplements do not exert therapeutic action and are not intended to prevent or cure a disease. What do food supplements contain?

The choice of a suitable food supplement passes above all by determining the real needs of his body. Indeed, nutritional needs are different from one individual to another. They depend on many factors, such as age, sex, state of health or even lifestyle. An athlete will not have the same needs as a sedentary person, just as a pregnant woman will not have the same needs as a woman who is breastfeeding or entering the menopause phase. As the choice of a dietary supplement has a direct impact on our health, it is absolutely necessary to see the interactions with the drugs and the current treatments and to check the compatibility of the dietary supplement with the state of vitamin deficiency . Specialists often recommend doing a health check, on the one hand to personalize multivitamin food supplements to have a more targeted effect on deficiencies and on the other hand, to avoid taking unnecessary risks.
