Is it a feeling you chase after but never quite reach, or a state of mind that you're able to tap into if you have the right resources? Happiness is a state of mind \u2014 an underlying sense of contentment, fulfillment, and satisfaction in life. Here's the good news: the feeling is already there, readily accessible, often buried beneath layers of thoughts and emotions. All it takes is tapping into it and reconnecting with a happy state of mind. By doing a happiness meditation such as the Headspace's [Happiness course](https://my.headspace.com/packs/6) (available to logged in subscribers), you can start mindfulness training to reconnect with that feeling and experience more happiness. Below, find everything you should know about the link between meditation and happiness. Achieving a sense of underlying contentment and satisfaction does not necessarily manifest itself as a wide-smile, explosive sort of happiness. Rather, it is a connection to something innate within us, leading us to this genuine sense of satisfaction and reconnection with our mind's happy state. In practicing meditation for joy and happiness, we are creating the conditions necessary to experience a happy state of mind. To do so, we are nurturing four essential supports or ingredients of happiness: kindness (for others and ourselves), empathy (for others and ourselves), playfulness, and inner balance. By integrating these aspects of ourselves into our daily lives, we can reconnect with a happy state of mind and step away from negative internal dialogue. Happiness meditation 0:00 0:01 Are we afraid of being happy? If you've ever struggled with [anxiety](https://www.headspace.com/meditation/anxiety) or [depression](https://www.headspace.com/blog/2015/11/24/welcome-to-the-depression-pack/), you might relate to a feeling of uneasiness, or even fear, surrounding happiness. This phenomenon is fairly common and can manifest itself differently for different people, according to research by [psychiatrist Paul Gilbert](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fear-of-happiness-underlies-some-mental-illnesses/?redirect=1) of Kingsway Hospital in England. Generally, this fear manifests itself under one of these three categories: If you can identify with any of these, you're not alone \u2014 and you're also not hopeless. Through a process called [neuroplasticity](https://brainworksneurotherapy.com/what-neuroplasticity), the brain is able to develop and change. Practicing meditation for joy and happiness will help you become more comfortable with these ideas. The happiness set point It has long been thought that each of us has a happiness [set point](http://changingminds.org/explanations/emotions/happiness/setpoint_happiness.htm), or a fixed average amount of happiness that we naturally have within us based on genetics \u2014 but thanks to neuroplasticity, the set point can be altered. Through [meditation](https://www.headspace.com/meditation/techniques), you can rewire your brain to reset its happiness set point. According to science, this is possible by [thickening the major areas of the brain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3004979/) responsible with helping you cope with uncomfortable situations, as well as shrinking the amygdala \u2014 the part of your brain that is activated when you experience stress.

First, take a moment to think about your practice. Picture yourself sitting on the side of the road and watching your thoughts, feelings, and external circumstances driving by. As you're watching them drive by, you might become unsettled by the movement. You might run into traffic and try to stop or chase after them \u2014 and become restless in the process. As you approach your practice, try to [shift your perspective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN6g2mr0p3Q) toward these passing thoughts and circumstances. Just watch and acknowledge.

For a few breath counts, inhale deeply through the nose and exhale through the mouth. Close your eyes as you allow your breath to return to its natural rhythm, solely through the nose. Take a moment to check in with your body and do a head-to-toe scan. How do you feel? Light or heavy? Still or agitated? As you return awareness to the breath, it's time to tap into your imagination. Visualize a speck of sunlight which starts in your chest area. This speck holds a feeling of happiness and fulfillment, and it's expanding in every direction. As it moves through and then beyond your body, it brings about a feeling of ease and allows the body to feel spacious and light. When you can't imagine it getting any bigger, let go of any focus. Opening your eyes, bring your awareness back to the body and become aware of the sights and smells surrounding it. Are you feeling more content? Hold on to that feeling.
