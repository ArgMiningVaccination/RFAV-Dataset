Constantly running on adrenaline can greatly wear the body down. We all know this, but what can we do about it? Beyond diet, exercise, and lifestyle changes, there are ways to actively manage your own spiritual energy and greatly enhance your sense of well-being. We sometimes think that our energy is at the mercy of associating with others (often called \" [energy vampires](https://www.yourtango.com/self/signs-an-energy-vampire-how-slay-them)\"). Instead, by using simple practices, you can proactively build, deepen and manage your own energetic field. RELATED: [The Essential Practice To Heal And Balance All 7 Chakras](https://www.yourtango.com/self/chakra-meditation) What is chakra balancing? Chakra balancing is a [type of energy healing](https://www.yourtango.com/experts/starchaser-coaching/how-spiritual-energy-healing-works) that specifically focuses on channeling positive energy into your seven chakras. When you balance your chakras, you're essentially removing any stagnant energy within your body and helping your chakras flow at a healthy rate. This practice comes from ancient India where the belief in a series of seven chakras, or energy centers, began. Chakra is the Sanskrit name for \"wheel,\" and if part of the wheel is damaged, the wheel is useless. Chakras are a system and, when one section of that system is locked, the other sections must overcompensate for that, which eventually throws the entire system out of whack! So, it's important to get all seven chakras balanced. What happens when you balance your chakras? When you balance your chakras, what you're doing is removing obstacles within your body's energy that is blocking the flow. It's getting rid of the mental and physical stress you're holding within you that is interrupting the flow of energy that your body needs in order to function. According to ancient Indian belief, balancing chakras helps your body function properly. Having balanced chakras can elicit great benefits for your body including physical improvement, being more open to new experiences, and the ability to adapt more freely to whatever life throws your way.
