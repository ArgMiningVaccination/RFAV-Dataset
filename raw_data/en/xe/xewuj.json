Usually for adults, hepatitis B goes away on its own and you won't need treatment. Your doctor might tell you to rest, eat well, and get plenty of fluids. You may also get medicines to help with any symptoms you might have \u2014 but be sure to talk with your doctor or nurse before taking anything. If you have chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis, there are medicines you can take to treat it. Your doctor will tell you about your options and help you get whatever treatment you need.
