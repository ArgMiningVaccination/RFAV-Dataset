Completing the full series of vaccines for your child or children is important to ensure they have the best protection against serious childhood diseases and dangerous complications. Getting all of the suggested vaccines in their first year is a great start. Immunization is one of the most important things a parents can do to protect their children's health. Failure to vaccinate may mean putting children at risk for serious diseases. Complete Each Series. Follow the Recommended Schedule. Your baby is vulnerable to many infectious diseases early in life, but if you follow the recommended immunization schedule provided by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), your child will have the best possible protection. Place the schedule on your refrigerator or in another prominent place so that you can make sure to vaccinate on time, every time. See the detailed [recommended schedule](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/downloads/parent-ver-sch-0-6yrs.pdf) from the CDC. Find out the exact dates your child should get vaccinated using the CDC's [vaccine scheduler](http://www2a.cdc.gov/nip/kidstuff/newscheduler_le/). Ask Your Doctor Talk to your doctor. Your pediatrician can answer any questions you may have about infant immunizations, and can help you plan ahead. As you leave one appointment, make sure you schedule the next one and get a reminder to stick on your fridge or in an email -- this will help you and your child stay on track. Your doctor can also help you learn about other programs provided by the state of Texas to help you and your family stay on top of your vaccines. Vaccines are Safe All vaccines used in the United States require extensive safety testing for years -- sometimes even decades -- before they are licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA and the CDC work with doctors and other health-care professionals throughout the U.S. to continually monitor the safety of vaccines. Learn more about how vaccines are [developed](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/infographics/journey-of-child-vaccine.html) and [approved](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/populations/parents.html).
