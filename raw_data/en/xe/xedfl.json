AN OVERVIEW OF THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF PHYTOESTROGENS INTRODUCTION 1. \"The beneficial effects of phytoestrogens in adults\" were reviewed in 1997 by the IEH in their report \"Review of certain aspects of the literature on phytoestrogens in the human diet\". The report concluded that the available epidemiological data, largely obtained from dietary surveys, were generally consistent with a high intake of plant foods (grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables) being a protective factor against cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and hormonally responsive tissues. However, this type of study did not allow identification of the particular components responsible. Some dietary intervention studies suggested that soy and linseed, which are rich in phytoestrogens, may exert effects associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer and alleviation of post-menopausal symptoms and cause alterations in blood lipid profile associated with decreased a risk of cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis. However, the data have not always been consistent. Beneficial effects of soy and linseed on the incidence of endometrial cancer and osteoporosis have not been confirmed, but the synthetic isoflavone , ipriflavone , has been shown to be effective in the prevention of osteoporosis and a positive association has been made between high-fruit and -vegetable intake and a decreased incidence of endometrial cancer. A direct association between any beneficial effect of soy and/or linseed and their phytoestrogen content has not been formally established in humans. 2. The present paper provide s an update (literature review completed February 2000) of human studies published since the preparation of the IEH report and also includes relevant animal data.ICTU/00/04x Draft 23/02/01 An Overview of the B eneficial Effects of Phytoestrogens.

The risk increases with age up to a certain point but thereafter declines with the onset of menopause. Nonetheless, development of breast cancer is highly dependent on the hormones associated with ovarian function and events that take place pre-menopausally, or even in adolescence, may determine the development of breast cancer post- menopausally. Established hormone-related risk factors include early onset of menarche, late onset of menopause, delayed age of first pregnancy and, in post-menopausal women, elevated free estradiol concentration. Identified genetic factors also account for a relatively small proportion of breast cancer in Western populations ( Bingham et al, 1998, and references therein). Influence of diet 4. Epidemiology studies have shown that the incidence of breast cancer is generally much lower in East Asia than in Western countries. The lower incidence has been, at least in part, associated with consumption of the typically Asian/Oriental (low-fat, high-fibre, high-soy) diet. Furthermore, it has been noted that Asian women who migrate to western cultures soon acquire western disease patterns for breast cancer (IEH, 1997 and references therein). This is exemplified in the American-Asian populations of Hawaii and California ( Wu et al, 1998). 5. Pooled analyses of 12 case-control studies have found a significant elevation of breast cancer risk associated with fat-intake in post-menopausal women, although prospective studies have failed to confirm this ( Bingham et al, 1998 and references therein). Although data from one prospective study (Willett et al, 1992) failed to uphold the argument, several other studies have suggested that low-fibre diets may be positive risk factors for breast cancer risk and that high intakes of fruit and vegetables are associated with a decreased risk. Furthermore, high-fibre intake has been correlated with a delay in menarche and early onset of menarche is associated with a higher breast cancer risk. (IEH, 1997, and references cited therein).ICTU/00/04x Draft 23/02/01 An Overview of the B eneficial Effects of Phytoestrogens. Meeting 4; page 3 of 25 3Influence of diets high in isoflavones or lignans 6. The extensive use of soy represents an obvious difference between the diets of populations in East Asian and those in the Western world. However, data from several observational studies have revealed no consistent association between soy intake and breast cancer risk. Two of four studies examining a wide range of dietary components in Japanese and Hawaiian women, reviewed by Messina et al (1994), found a significant negative association, while two others showed no significant association with breast cancer risk. One additional study in Singapore-Chinese women reported a negative association between intakes of soy protein and total soy in pre- menopausal but not in post-menopausal women (Lee et al, 1991) while a further two studies in Chinese and Japanese women suggested that there was no relationship between breast cancer risk and intake of soy in women of any age ( Yuan et al, 1995; Hirose et al, 1995). More recently, Witte et al (1997) observed an inverse association between bilateral breast cancer incidence in pre-menopausal women in the US and Canada and tofu intake and Wu et al (1996) reported a 3-fold lowering of breast cancer risk associated with high tofu intake in both pre- and post-menopausal women in the US. 7. It has been suggested that the isoflavone and lignan constituents of soy and linseed may be acting as anti-cancer agents. Several epidemiology studies have examined levels of urinary levels of lignans and isoflavones, which are assumed to be a reflection of their intake, and the associated risk of developing breast cancer. In a sub-study of a large population based case- control study in China, Zheng et al (1999) measured urinary excretion of isoflavones in 60 newly diagnosed breast cancer cases in women (median age 46 yrs; range 41-49) and their individually matched controls. The data showed substantially lower urinary excretion of major isoflavonoids in the breast cancer cases (P = 0.04) and individuals in the highest tertile had ~ half the cancer risk of those in the lowest tertile. The adjusted OR (odds ratio) for breast cancer was 0.14 [CI (95% confidence interval) 0.02-0.88] for women whose urinary excretion of total isoflavonoids was in the upper 50% compared to those in the lower 50%. Ingram et al (1997) carried out a study in 144 Australian women (median age 54; range 45-62.5) newly diagnosed with breast cancer and individually matched controls and showed that high excretion of both equol and enterolactone was associated with a reduction inICTU/00/04x Draft 23/02/01 An Overview of the B eneficial Effects of Phytoestrogens. Meeting 4; page 4 of 25 4breast-cancer risk, with a significant trend through the quartiles. For the upper quartile, the associated risk was ~ 3 times lower. These results were commensurate with the findings of three earlier studies ( Adlercreutz et al, 1995, 1986 & 1991). 8. It should be noted, however, that while these data show a strong negative association between isoflavone and/or lignan consumption and breast cancer risk, they can not confirm whether the association is causal rather than casual. 9. It has been suggested that breast cancer risk may be related to life- time exposure to estrogen and that phytoestrogens may reduce this in some way. However, controlled intervention studies have failed to show any consistent effects of soy supplements on pre- or post-menopausal serum estrogen levels ( Cassidy et al, 1994; Lu et al, 1996 a; Petrakis et al, 1996; Baird et al, 1995; Phipps et al, 1993; Nagata et al, 1998 & 1997) 10. The associations between high phytoestrogen diets and breast cancer risk and between menstrual cycle length and risk of breast cancer make the link between phytoestrogen intake and menstrual cycle length an interesting area of investigation. The fact that menstrual cycles in Far Eastern women, consuming high-soy high- phytoestrogen diets, are generally longer than in Western women and breast cancer incidence is lower lend strong support to this idea ( Bingham et al, 1998 and references therein). It has been suggested that a longer cycle length results in lower exposure to estradiol in the luteal phase and, over a life-time, this could correlate to a lower risk of breast cancer. However, it has been found that irregular rather than longer menstrual cycles are generally related to lower cancer risk ( Bingham et al, 1998 and references therein). 11. The effects of isoflavone and lignan supplementation on hormones and menstrual cycle in pre-menopausal women are summarised in Table 1. Data from studies of the effects of phytoestrogen consumption on human menstrual cycle length have been mixed. One study reported that soybean supplements (as textured vegetable protein, containing 45 mg isoflavones/d) suppressed gonadotrophin output and increased the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle by 2-3 d in pre-menopausal women ( Cassidy et al, 1994). Moreover, the same effect was not observed with supplements from which the isoflavones hadICTU/00/04x Draft 23/02/01 An Overview of the B eneficial Effects of Phytoestrogens. Meeting 4; page 5 of 25 5been removed ( Cassidy et al, 1995). Soy-milk and linseed supplements were also reported to cause increases in menstrual cycle length. However, these effects were not significant and were specifically related to the luteal rather than follicular phase ( Lu et al 1996 b; Phipps et al, 1993). Preliminary data from an on-going cross-over dietary intervention study with wash out period, reported by Kurzer et al (1998, abstract), suggested that diets supplemented with soy powder (providing 0, 1 or 2 mg/kg isoflavones) result in a trend towards increased luteal-phase length and correction of luteal-phase abnormalities. However, a full length report by Duncan et al (1999a), possibly of the same trial, in which 14 pre-menopausal women were given daily soy powder supplements, containing ~64 or ~128 mg isoflavones /d, over 3 menstrual cycles plus 9 days, showed no treatment-related changes in menstrual cycle length, in either follicular phase or luteal phase. Consequently at this time, it is not possible to attribute the longer menstrual cycle lengths of Asian women, typically consuming high soy diets, specifically to phytoestrogen intake, with any certainty. 12. There are competing pathways for the metabolism of estrogen which result in the formation of metabolites with differing biological ( estrogen) potency. It has been suggested that the balance of 2-hydroxyestrogen to 16 - hydroxyestrogen metabolites may be serve as a biomarker of breast cancer risk, with an increased ratio considered to be protective ( Haggans et al, 1999 and references cited therein ) . An increase in the ratio of urinary 2- hydroxyestrone: 16 hydroxyestrone was reported in pre-menopausal women supplemented with isoflavones in the form soy flour, along with decreased amounts of urinary estradiol, al, 1998, Table 1). Similarly, a randomised cross-over study involving 28 post-menopausal women showed that flaxseed supplements ( 5 g/d, for 7 weeks) resulted in significant increases (P<0.05) in 2-hydroxyestrogens and the ratio of 2-hydroxyestrone: 16 hydroxyestrone excreted in urine ( Haggans et al, 1999) and the authors consequently suggested that these data indicated potential chemoprotective properties of flaxseed in post-menopausal women. 13. Markers of high ri sk in post- menopausal women also include high levels of androstenedione, testosterone and lower levels of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). Observational studies support the suggestion that phytoestrogens ( lignans and isoflavones) may exert a protective effect by lowering plasma free estrogen and androgenICTU/00/04x Draft 23/02/01 An Overview of the B eneficial Effects of Phytoestrogens. Meeting 4; page 6 of 25 6levels through in et al, 1998 [abstract]). However, confirmation of this from several limited intervention studies has not been forthcoming (Tham et al, 1998 and references therein). Animals studies 14. Animal studies provided early evidence that soy may be protective in experimental (chemically- or radiation-induced) models of breast cancer (Troll et al, 1980; Barnes et al, 1990; Hawrylewicz et al, 1991). Effects were abolished in soy protein that was completely devoid of isoflavones, suggesting that these constituents may be the active anti-cancer constituents (Barnes et al, 1990). More recently, Ito et al (1998, abstract) showed that the inclusion of either 10% miso , 2 or 10% soy bean or `10 or 50 ppm biochanin A in the diet was quoted as \"more or less\" inhibitory for tumours The suggestion of isoflavone-related anti-cancer effects in vivo have been supported by numerous studies in vitro in which daidzein and genistein have been shown to inhibit cell growth ( Adlercreutz 1995; Barnes 1995). 15. Neonatal ( s.c. injection, 5 mg, on days 2, 4, and 6 postpartum) and prepubertal (s.c. injection, 500 \u00b5g/g body wt, on days 16, 18 and 20 postpartum) exposure to genistein was found to halve the number and delay the appearance of chemically-induced mammary tumours in a rat model of breast cancer ( Lamartiniere et al, 1995; Murrill et al, 1996). Animals were treated with chemical carcinogen, dimethylbenz [a]anthrene, on day 50 postpartum. In those animals treated prepubertally, levels of genistein in plasma were found to be 4 \u00b5M and 100 nM on postpartum day 21 and day 50, respectively. However, in those animals that received isoflavone treatment neonatally, no genistein was detected in the plasma d50 post- partum. A dose-related decrease in chemically-induced tumours was also observed in rats exposed to genistein from conception to day 21 postpartum through the maternal diet (25 or 250 ppm). Levels of genistein in the plasma of 7 and 21 day-old offspring of mothers fed the higher genistein dose were 726 nM and 1810 nM (Fritz et al, 1998). Fritz et al (1998) also demonstrated that the terminal end buds of mammary glands of female rats treated with genistein had a smaller proliferative compartment and it was suggested that genistein had enhanced mammary cell differentiation which reduced susceptibility toICTU/00/04x Draft 23/02/01 An Overview of the B eneficial Effects of Phytoestrogens. Meeting 4; page 7 of 25 7mammary cancer. However, the timing of exposure appears to be an important factor in determining the efficacy of the isoflavones. In comparison, administration of genistein at a later age appeared to be less effective. Reduction of mammary tumours was only 27% when genistein was administered to rats > 35 d old (0.8 mg/rat/d, i.p. 180 d). Levels of genistein achieved in plasma were not specified ( Constantinou et al., 1996). In contrast to the above studies, Hilakivi-Clarke et al (1999) found that exposure in utero alone (maternal s.c. injection, 20, 100 or 300 \u00b5g, days 15-20 of gestation) increased chemically-induced mammary tumours in female rat offspring. Consequently, early-postnatal exposure may be critical for an optimal anti- cancer effect of phytoestrogens. 16. Notwithstanding, biochanin A has also been found to exert an anti- cancer effect in a chemically-induced model of breast cancer in rats when administered after the carcinogen ( Gotoh et al, 1998), indicating that the protective effects of isoflavones (and possibly other phytoestrogens) may not just be restricted to early life exposure. In this experiment, biochanin A was included in the diet to provide a dose of 0.48-2.4 mg/kg/d which is similar to the daily intake of isoflavones in South-East Asians (0.5-1.0 mg/kg, as quoted by Barnes, 1998). Conclusions 17. In conclusion, there has been much optimism in the literature regarding the breast cancer preventing potential of phytoestrogens. Diets high in soy, which also contain high levels of phytoestrogens, have been associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer, particularly in pre-menopausal women. A few dietary intervention studies, providing supplements containing phytoestrogens, indicate changes in biomarkers which could be associated with a decreased breast cancer risk. Animal studies support the notion that phytoestrogens per se may be active anti-cancer components. In vitro studies (not reviewed here) have identified a number of possible mechanisms, not all reliant on estrogenic/ antiestrogenic activity, by which these compounds may exert their ant-cancer effects. However, clinical data, attributing beneficial effects specifically to phytoestrogens, are presently lacking. Large-scale prospective clinical studies are needed since the available epidemiology data, by in large, have not specifically addressed the question of the role of phytoestrogens in relation to breast cancer.ICTU/00/04x Draft 23/02/01 An Overview of the B eneficial Effects of Phytoestrogens. Meeting 4; page 8 of 25 8PERI-MENOPAUSAL AND POST-MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS Endocrinology and symptoms 18. In endocrinological terms, menopause is ovarian failure and is associated with high levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and low levels of estradiol. The peri-menopausal transition, which occurs 1-5 years prior to the menopause, is characterised first by irregularities, then shortening, in menstrual cycle length followed by intermittent skipping of cycles. Throughout this time, the months swing between high and low estrogen and women commonly experience symptoms that include hot flushes, depression, anxiety, irritability, formication, tiredness and fatigue, insomnia, palpitations, vaginal dryness, poor memory, poor concentration and muscle and joint aches. The pathophysiology of the hot flush is uncertain but it appears that the withdrawal of estrogen may be the primary trigger. In most Western countries, 80 % of menopausal women experience hot flushes which, in ~ one third, are frequent, severe and often accompanied by sensations of tenseness, tiredness, irritability, headaches and muscle and joint pain. In contrast to other symptoms, which are mainly experienced peri-menopausally, vaginal dryness is usually a problem for ~50% of women after menopause occurs (Eden, 1998 and references therein). Prevalence of symptoms: Eastern vs Western women 19. Menopausal symp toms appear to vary from country to country and it has been reported that the prevalence of hot sweats and flushes are lower in South East Asian women than in their Western counterparts. In some countries the predominant symptom is headache rather than hot flush. Hypothesised explanations for these differences include cultural factors and diet, particularly regarding phytoestrogen intake (Eden, 1998 and references therein). Influence of foods high in phytoestrogens: Intervention studies (Table 2) 20. Seve ral clinical trials have now specifically examined the effects of high- phytoestrogen containing foods and herbs on menopausal symptoms and vaginal cytology in menopausal women (Wilcox et al, 1990, Murkies et al, 1995; Baird et al 1995; Brzezinski et al 1997; Albertazzi et al, 1998 & 1999). Results and conclusions have been variable and hampered by strong placebo responses. Thus, in three of these studies, while phytoestrogen rich dietsICTU/00/04x Draft 23/02/01 An Overview of the B eneficial Effects of Phytoestrogens. Meeting 4; page 9 of 25 9resulted in 40-55% reduction in hot flushes over a 12-week period, 20-35% reductions were also seen in the controls. Where measured, effects on vaginal epithelia ranged from increases in maturation index1 to no significant changes. 21. Several other intervention trials have been reported recently in abstract form. In a randomised, cross-over, placebo-controlled study involving 50 women, Husband et al (1999, abstract) investigated the effect of Promensil (a commercially available isoflavone supplement containing 40 mg of isoflavones from red clover extract, 1-4 tablets/d for 12 weeks) on menopausal symptoms. Pooled (test and control group) urinary excretion data indicated a significant correlation between levels of urinary excretion of isoflavones and a reduced incidence of hot flushes. Urinary excretion of isoflavones correlated well with supplement intake in the test group. However, ~ 50% of placebo controls also had high levels of urinary isoflavones, which presumably resulted from high dietary intakes and may have been responsible for a high apparent placebo response. Nonetheless, in placebo subjects where urinary isoflavones were low, a smaller reduction in number of flushes was observed and the authors suggested that this represented the true placebo effect. 22. Preliminary results from a short-term, double-blind, cross-o ver study of peri-menopausal women, reported by Burke et al (1998, abstract), indicated a slight decrease in the severity of menopausal symptoms in women consuming a soy protein isolate supplement compared to an iso-caloric placebo control supplement. In addition, soy supplement related improvements in lipid/lipoprotein profile and blood pressure were also reported. 23. Eden et al (1998, abstract) briefly described a pilot study, involving 9 menopausal women, given an isoflavone supplement (160 mg) of either soy protein or red clover origin, for 12 weeks. Results indicated a significant decrease in average \"Greene\" menopausal score (P<0.002) and in the number of flushes (vasomotor symptoms) per day (P<0.02). Harding et al (1998, abstract) reported preliminary results from a double-blind, cross-over study, including washout period, in which menopausal women exhibiting severe vasomotor symptoms were given soy-protein (80 mg total isoflavones ) 1 Cytological evaluation of the effects of an estrogen given in menopause according to the formula of Hustin Van B eneficial Effects of Phytoestrogens. Meeting 4; page 10 of 2510or placebo drinks, daily for 2 mo. Preliminary analyses of the data suggested a significant (P<0.03) soy-related reduction in frequency of hot flushes. Murkies et al (1998, abstract) reported a randomised, double-blind study in post-menopausal women experiencing 14 hot flushes/week (n=58, 47 completed). Half the subjects received 45g of soy flour/d and others received 45 g of refined wheat flour, for 12 weeks. Hot flushes were significantly decreased in both soy flour and wheat flour groups (40 and 25%, respectively, P<0.001) and scores for other menopausal symptoms were also decreased (P<0.05). The response in the soy flour group was more rapid. Woods et al (1998, abstract) briefly described preliminary data from an intervention study (sample size not given) in high symptomatic menopausal women, administered soy bars (equivalent 40 mg phytoestrogen/d) for minimum of 12 weeks. Results suggested a high basal inter-individual variation and a small in symptoms decrease (-1.7 hot flashes per day \u00b1 3.9 SD) when women were on the soy treatment. Bzrezinski and Debi (1999) referred to an, as yet, unpublished study in which 50 post-menopausal women were given either 500 mg capsules of \"soy phytochemical extract\" (containing ~11 mg/g phytoestrogens), 2x2 per d, or placebo. Preliminary results after 3mo indicated that consumption of the soy phytochemical extract was associated with significant reductions in menopausal symptomology and reduced total cholesterol. 24. In contrast, Washburn et al (1999) reported no significant effect of soy protein supplementation (20 g/d containing 34 mg phytoestrogens, either in one single or two split doses) on frequency of menopausal symptoms in a randomised, double-blind, cross-over study in 51 peri-menopausal women. Furthermore, findings from a short (4 week) intervention study of 177 women with a history of breast cancer, given 150 mg soy isoflavones/d, suggested that the supplements did not substantially reduce hot flushes compared with placebo ( Quella et al, 2000). Conclusions 25. In conclusion, data from studies investigating whether phytoestrogens provide relief for women from menopausal symptoms are inconsistent. Several studies suggest that soy may help some women cope with some of the symptoms of menopause, especially if their basal dietary intake is low. However, other studies have reported no such beneficial effects. Many of the more recent studies have been reported in the form of abstracts, whichICTU/00/04x Draft 23/02/01 An Overview of the B eneficial Effects of Phytoestrogens. Meeting 4; page 11 of 2511provide only brief descriptions and preliminary results. Confirmation of the outcomes of these studies awaits full publication of details and data. OSTEOPOROSIS 26. Osteoporosis is a condition in which bone density is decreased, although the composition remains unaltered. Bone becomes porous due to an imbalance between the bone cells responsible for formation and resorption of bone. This results in structural failure and an increased likelihood of fracture. In the UK, the number of hip and osteoporotic fractures is likely to increase as the proportion of the population over the age of 65 years increases. Osteoporosis is particularly a problem in women post-menopause, due to the acceleration of bone loss associated with estrogen loss. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is effective in preventing bone loss, up to the age of at least 75 years, provided it is taken for several years early on in the post- menopausal phase ( Bingham et al, 1998 and references therein). 27. The relative rarity of the disease in those populations consuming high levels of soybean and the known hormonal effects of phytoestrogens have prompted investigations of their effects in osteoporosis. Bone retention and phytoestrogens Animal studies 28. Data obtained from rodents have consistently demonstrated improvements in the retention of bone mass following ovariectomy when animals are treated with soy or soy- isoflavone, particularly genistein, and less so daidzein, enriched diets (Anderson and Garner, 1998 and references therein). Coumestrol and zearalanol also have been found effective in improving femur bone mineral density in a similar rat model (Anderson and Garner, 1998 and references therein; Scheiber and Rebar, 1999 and references therein). In contrast, a prospective study in ovariectomised monkeys ( Jayo et al, 1996, abstract, as described by Anderson and Garner, 1998) found no positive effect on bone of daily supplementation with a phytoestrogen-enriched preparation, apparently containing 28 mg isoflavones, over 2 years. However, it was suggested that the dose of isoflavones givenICTU/00/04x Draft 23/02/01 An Overview of the B eneficial Effects of Phytoestrogens. Meeting 4; page 12 of 2512was not sufficiently large to exert an effect on bone mass and density, implying that there may be a threshold dose for activity. Intervention studies in human (Table 3) 29. Human studies examining the relationship between phytoestrogen intake and osteoporosis are sparse. Erdman et al (1996) studied 66 post- menopausal women provided isoflavone supplements (55.6 or 90 mg/d) for 6 mo. Compared to casein controls, there was a significant increase (P<0.05) in bone mineral density and bone mineral content in the lumbar spine in the 90 mg/d dose group. Potter et al (1998) conducted a parallel group, randomised double-blind trial in 66 hypercholesterolemic post-menopausal women, consuming a low fat, low cholesterol diet and provided 40 g protein/d from either non-fat dry milk (control), isolated soy protein containing 1.39 mg isoflavones /g or isolated soy protein containing 2.25 mg isoflavones /g, for 6 mo. Significant increases in bone mineral content and density were seen in the lumbar spine, but not at any other site, in the high-dose isoflavone group, compared to baseline measurements (P<0.05). A small randomised, placebo- controlled study, involving 30 post-menopausal, non- osteoporotic women, revealed reduced urinary excretion of markers of bone resorption (d- pyridolinoline and N- telopeptide) in the study group that received 60 g/day soy protein for 3 mo, when compared to casein controls ( Bonaccorsi et al, 1997, abstract). 30. In contrast to the limited effect observed with supplements of \"natural\" isoflavones, the synthetic isoflavone, ipriflavone (7-isopropoxyisoflavone) is now well established as an effective treatment for inhibiting bone resorption in post-menopausal women ( Scheiber and Rebar, 1999 and references therein; Ohta et al, 1999). However, its mechanism of action, which remains to be fully elucidated, is not directly attributed to interaction with oestrogen receptors and the doses required to be effective (200-600 mg/d) are considerably higher than expected intakes of natural isoflavones from the diet. Red wine 31. Post-menopausal women randomised to receive 100 \u00b5g of trans- resveratrol (~ 4 glasses red wine per day) for 6 months demonstrated increased bone mineral content and density (p<0.005) (references cited by Calabrese 1999).ICTU/00/04x Draft 23/02/01 An Overview of the B eneficial Effects of Phytoestrogens. Meeting 4; page 13 of 2513Conclusions 32. In conclusion, studies in rodents have shown that soy isoflavones and other phytoestrogens are effective in conserving bone in rodent models of osteoporosis. These effects were not confirmed in a study in primates, although this was thought to be due to insufficient dosing. Intervention studies in humans have been fairly limited and relatively short-term. So far, bone preservation effects of phytoestrogens demonstrated in post-menopausal women have been small and confined to the lumbar vertebrae. There is little or no-dose response information. Additional larger and longer-term human studies are required before the efficacy of phytoestrogen supplements can be confirmed with certainty. ENDOMETRIAL CANCER 33. Cancer of the endometrium is more common in developed countries and the pattern of hormonal risk is similar to that associated with breast cancer. Many case-control studies have shown that the combined oral contraceptive pill is protective against endometrial cancer. However, there is substantial evidence to suggest that unopposed estrogens, such as those from hormone replacement therapy, present an increased risk (IEH, 1997; Bingham, 1999; Beral et al, 1999). After the menopause, the other main source of estrogen is from endogenous formation in the adipose tissue and obesity represents a substantial risk factor. 34. At present, there are no rep orts associating an increased or decreased risk with plant estrogens. The incidence of endometrial cancer in Japan (where there is a high phytoestrogen intake) is low, relative to the UK (Bingham , 1999 and references therein) and one report concerning Asian immigrants in Hawaii found that soy consumption was associated with a decreased risk (P for trend 0.009, associated with increased consumption of legumes, particularly tofu and other soy products, OR = 0.66, 0.56 and 0.50 for women in the 2nd, 3rd and highest quartiles of soy consumption, respectively, compared to women in the lowest quartile) (Goodman et al, 1997; 1998, abstract).ICTU/00/04x Draft 23/02/01 An Overview of the B eneficial Effects of Phytoestrogens. Meeting 4; page 14 of 2514OVARIAN CANCER 35. No studies specifically investigating any association or relationship between consumption of phytoestrogens and ovarian cancer have been identified from the available literature. PROSTATE CANCER Epidemiology studies: The influence of diet 36. Prostate cancer is the most common hormone-related cancer in men and its incidence in the UK is increasing ( Colman et al, 1993). Increased risk is currently linked to high-fat, high-meat and low-fibre diets ( Bingham et al, 1998 and references therein). Epidemiology data have shown that the incidence of prostate cancer is relatively low in Asian and Finnish populations and this may be attributed to the consumption of diets that provide a high intake of isoflavones and/or lignans (IEH Report, 1997, and references therein). Some protective dietary factors have been tentatively identified, e.g. legumes, green-yellow vegetable, fruit and nuts, although the IEH report identified no human data to link a significantly decreased risk with the consumption of soy or soy products or to directly attribute any protective role to phytoestrogens (see IEH Report, 1997 and references therein). More recently, however, a study reported by Hebert et al (1999), using UN data from 56 countries, found an inverse association between prostate cancer mortality and several dietary factors including the estimated consumption of cereals (P=0.001) and nuts and oilseeds (P=0.003). Furthermore, appropriate data available from 42 countries showed that soy products were to be significantly protective (P=0.0001). A prospective study involving 225 incident cases of prostate cancer in 12,395 California Seventh Day Adventist men showed that frequent consumption (more than once a day) of soy milk was associated with a 70% reduction in prostate cancer risk (RR [relative risk] = 0.3 CI 0.1-1.0, P for trend = 0.03) ( Jacobsen et al, 1998). Strom et al (1999) examined phytoestrogen intake and prostate cancer risk in 83 Caucasian cases and 107 controls. Controls reported consuming higher amounts of foods containing daidzein, genistein and coumestrol and lower amounts of foods containing stigmasterol and campesterol. However, the only inverse association with prostate cancer found to be significant at the 95% confidenceICTU/00/04x Draft 23/02/01 An Overview of the B eneficial Effects of Phytoestrogens. Meeting 4; page 15 of 2515level was that with coumestrol (P=0.03). A significantly positive association was found with stigmasterol (P=0.03). Linseed and soy intervention studies 37. Studies have shown that both linseed and soybean supplements have no effect on testosterone levels ( Bingham et al, 1998 and references therein) and data from an intervention study in men with abnormal prostate-specific antigen, described in an abstract from Barnes et al (1998), have not been forthcoming. Animal studies 38. Animal studies have shown that soy may provide protection from the development of implanted prostate tumours and tumour cells. For example, it has been demonstrated that exposure to soybean in utero delayed the development of morphological changes, similar to those observed in human prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia, in Han: NMRI male mice estrogenised with shortly after birth ( Makela et al, 1995). Landstrom et al (1998) have demonstrated the inhibition of development of transplanted prostate tumours in rats maintained on a diet containing 33% soy flour, compared to an iso-caloric fibre-free diet. Further studies implicated the isoflavone constituents as protective ingredients. Accordingly, diets containing concentrates of soy phytochemicals, but not soy protein isolate alone, were found to inhibit the growth of tumours, following inoculation of LNCaP human prostate tumour cells, in immuno-deficient mice ( Zhou et al, 1999). Furthermore, Onozawa et al (1999) reported that a normal diet supplemented 100 ppm isoflavones (74% adenocarcinomas in the seminal vesicles and prostate of F344 rats. Schleicher et al (1998, abstract) showed that genistein, administered by repeated subcutaneous injection, significantly inhibited the development of prostate carcinoma following the implantation of 10*10-6 K1 prostate carcinoma cells in Lobund-Wistar rats, resulting in fewer invasive tumours and cases of metastases. 39. The development of prostate cancer in man and spontaneous tumours of the prostate seminal vesicle (P-SV) are thought to share common mechanisms and characteristics and animal studies have provided supportive evidence of a protective role for isoflavones in the development of the disease. For example, Pollard (1999) have reported that the incidence ofICTU/00/04x Draft 23/02/01 An Overview of the B eneficial Effects of Phytoestrogens. Meeting 4; page 16 of 2516spontaneous PS-V tumours in genetically predisposed Lobund-Wistar rats was suppressed when animals were maintained on a diet containing high levels of isoflavones in the form of soy-protein isolate. Only 7.5% of animals were found to develop spontaneous PS-V tumours when fed a high isoflavone diet from the age of 12-24 months compared to 27% of animals maintained on a control diet. Results from a 2-24 month feeding study have yet to be reported. CANCER OF THE COLON AND RECTUM 40. Cancer of the bowel is the second most common cancer in the UK, after breast cancer in women and lung cancer in men. Factors important in the development of the disease are likely to be both dietary and hereditary. Until the 1960s, colorectal cancer was fairly rare in Japan and the Far East, but the incidence has rapidly increased so that the age-related rate in Japanese men is now actually higher than that in their UK counterparts. It is suggested that this change may be largely attributed to westernisation of the Japanese diet, resulting in a decreased consumption of soy products (thus less phytoestrogens), fruits, vegetables and fibre, and an increased intake of dietary fat ( Bingham, 1999 and references therein; IEH, 1997 and references therein). 41. Colorectal cancer is not generally regarded as a as a hormone- dependent cancer, as are breast and prostrate cancer. Although, some epidemiology studies have suggested that estrogen may be protective, data have not been consistent ( Messina and Bennink, 1998 and references therein). 42. Decreased risk of colon cancer has been associated with hig h dietary fibre, high consumption of leafy green vegetables and an increased ratio of dietary plant sterols (particularly -sitosterol, which has also been shown to protect against experimentally-induced colon cancer) to cholesterol (studies cited in IEH, 1997). Messina and Bessink (1998) reviewed eight case-control studies that considered the relationship between soy-food intake and colorectal cancer risk ( Haenzel et 1984; 1985; Hu et Hoshiyama et al, 1993; Nishi et al, 1997; Le Marchand, 1997). The results of these studies were mixed butICTU/00/04x Draft 23/02/01 An Overview of the B eneficial Effects of Phytoestrogens. Meeting 4; page 17 of 2517generally did not support the hypothesis that soy intake reduces the risk of colorectal cancer. None of the studies found any significant association between intake of soy or soy products (excluding miso) and a decreased risk of colonic cancer. However, four studies (Watanabe et al, 1984; Hu et al, 1991; Hoshiyama et al, 1993; Le Marchand et al, 1997 - women only) reported a decreased risk for rectal cancer associated with soy or soy products (excluding miso). It should also be noted that some studies reported increased risk for some soy products and colonic ( Haenzel et al 1973; Hoshiyama et al, 1993) and rectal cancers (Tajima and Tominaga, 1985). Two studies of colorectal polyps ( Kono et al, 1993; Witte et al, 1996) suggested that soy might be protective, however, in both cases, the results were not statistically significant. 43. Despite the protective effect associated with high-fibre, -fruit and - vegetable intake, there has been little attempt to relate this specifically to lignan intake. However, a study of a rat model of colon cancer has shown that flaxseed can reduce the number of chemically-induced aberrant crypts, which are considered to be early markers of the disease (Thompson, 1998 and references therein; Bingham, 1999 and references therein). Two studies have similarly shown that the soy isoflavone, genistein can also protect against the development of chemically-induced pre- neoplastic lesions of the colon in the rat (Steele et al, 1995; Helms and Gallaher, 1995; Thiagarajan et al, 1998). However, a third study, also in rats, found that genistein actually enhanced the number and multiplicity of chemically-induced non-invasive adenocarcinomas of the colon, although the number and multiplicity of invasive adenocarcinomas were unaffected ( Rao et al, 1997). One other study showed soy isoflavones were not protective against the development of intestinal tumours in ApcMin mice fed a Western-type high risk diet (Sorensen et al, 1998). Furthermore, Gallaher et al (1998, abstract) demonstrated that casein diets supplemented with either soy protein isolate or genistein had no effect on the progression of transplanted human colon tumours in nude mice and any effect on the initiation or promotion of chemically ( dimethylhydrazine)- induced aberrant crypts (colon pre-cancerous lesions) in rats was equivocal. Summary 44. In summary, while there is evidence to suggest that increased consumption of fruits and vegetables may be protective against cancer of theICTU/00/04x Draft 23/02/01 An Overview of the B eneficial Effects of Phytoestrogens. Meeting 4; page 18 of 2518colon and rectum in humans, there is currently no evidence to attribute this effect to the phytoestrogens contained within these foods. STOMACH CANCER 45. The incidence of stomach cancer in the UK is r elatively low, whereas incidence of the same disease in Japan, although declining, is one of the highest in the world. Positive risk factors include infection with Helicobacter pylori, cigarette smoking, low levels of serum ferritin, high salt intake, and pickled vegetables. Negative associations have been suggested for fresh vegetables (particularly cabbage, lettuce and tomato) and fruit (IEH, 1997 and references therein). 46. Soy intake and stomach cancer Epidemiological investigations have shown associations between soy and stomach cancer to be inconsistent (data reviewed by Messina et al, 1994). One ecological study found that fermented soybeans increased risk, whereas bean curd decreased risk but no statistically significant associations between the consumption of soybeans, fried bean curd, or bean paste and gastric cancer were noted. Another study found significant inverse associations between gastric cancer and tofu consumption in both men and women. An inverse association was also seen between the consumption of miso (fermented soy) soup and stomach cancer in women but this was not significant. One cohort study found no significant association between miso soup or tofu intake and gastric cancer risk in 7,990 American men of Japanese ancestry in Hawaii, although there was a protective trend associated with tofu consumption. A further cohort study found a significant graded association between the consumption of soybean paste and green/leafy vegetables and gastric cancer risk among 122,261 men and women followed for 13 years. Among case-control studies, 3 studies have shown an association between intake of miso soup or fermented soy paste and increased stomach cancer risk, although one did not achieve significance on multivariate analysis, 2 studies have found no significant association and one study has shown a decreased risk. For non-fermented soy products, significant negative associations have been noted on separate occasions for soybean, bean curd and soy- milk consumption. However, 2 additional studies noted no significant associations between stomach cancer risk andICTU/00/04x Draft 23/02/01 An Overview of the B eneficial Effects of Phytoestrogens. Meeting 4; page 19 of 2519intake of either bean curd and non- miso soy products. In a further study, a decreased risk for soy products and soy milk were reported but P values were not given (data reviewed by Messina et al, 1994). 47. It can be seen from the above account that, although the data are inconsistent, increased risk of stomach cancer has been more frequently associated with fermented soy products and a decreased risk more often associated with unfermented products. No study showed any increase in risk to be associated with un-fermented soy products. Lignan intake and stomach cancer 48. There has been no evidence to directly link increased lignan intake with reduced risk of stomach cancer, although a decreased risk is highly associated with high consumption of fruit and vegetables, which have a relatively high lignan content. Animal studies 49. Animal studies have shown that dietary supplementation with miso (fermented soy) attenuated chemically-induced gastric carcinogenesis promoted by sodium chloride in rats (Watanabe et al, 1999). Similar results were seen with prolonged administration of genistein (Tatsuta M et al, 1999). The mechanism by which genistein exerted its action was thought to involve induction of an increased level of apoptosis and lower cell proliferation and angiogenesis of the antral mucosa and gastric tumours. Studies in mice have shown that flavour components of Japanese style fermented soy sauce, including 4-hydroxy-2 (or 5)-ethyl-5 (or the forestomach ( Kataoka et al, 1997). Summary and conclusions 50. In summary, at present there is no evidence to indicate that any protection, provided by fruit and vegetables, against the development of gastric cancer in humans, can be attributed to their phytoestrogen (isoflavone/ lignan) content. Human data concerning the protective effect of unfermented soy products are inconclusive but a high intake of fermented soy products has been associated with increased stomach cancer risk. This contrasts findings in animal studies where fermented soy products have beenICTU/00/04x Draft 23/02/01 An Overview of the B eneficial Effects of Phytoestrogens. Meeting 4; page 20 of 2520shown to protect against chemically-induced gastric cancer and genistein has been shown to be an active constituent. LUNG CANCER 51. Evidence for a protective effect of soy and soy products on the risk of lung cancer is limited. Three out of four case control studies, reviewed by Messina et al (1994) and cited in the IEH review (1997), showed a significant protective effect associated with tofu intake. No additional studies providing supporting data have been published since the 1997 IEH report. 52. There are no data available on which to base any evaluation of the effect of lignans on the risk of lung cancer. CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE /CORONARY HEART DISEASE /ATHEROSCLEROSIS Risk factors 53. The lowering of serum cholesterol has been suggested as a factor for reducing risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), and total mortality. A 1% lowering of plasma cholesterol, on a population basis, can translate to a 2-3% reduction in risk of CHD ( Bingham et al, 1998 and references sited therein). Cholesterol reduction can be achieved by decreasing dietary saturated fat or by drug therapy. Post-menopausal estrogens and HRT may also be protective against CHD by specifically decreasing plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and/or increasing of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and causing vascular effects in both vasomotor tone and vessel wall compliance. Lipoprotein (a) [ Lp(a)] is also acknowledged as a primary predictor of heart disease. Levels of Lp(a) are genetically determined and are decreased by up to 35% by estrogens and other sex steroids (Knight and Eden, 1996 and references therein). Influence of soy and linseed 54. The IEH review (IEH, 1997) concluded that soy, some soy products and linseed oil also have plasma cholesterol and LDL (low-density-lipoprotein) cholesterol lowering properties. Reductions of up to 10-15% have been observed, with maximal effects being achieved in individuals already classedICTU/00/04x Draft 23/02/01 An Overview of the B eneficial Effects of Phytoestrogens. Meeting 4; page 21 of 2521as hypercholesterolemic. However, the report also concluded that, for the general population, consumption of soy and linseed was likely to be protective against cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis. It was suggested that components of soy and linseed, other than phytoestrogens, may be responsible for the apparent hypolipidemic properties. However, it was noted that animal feeding studies, involving soy-protein isolates, with and without isoflavones, have suggested that isoflavones may contribute up to 70% of the hypolipidemic effect of soy, although this had not been substantiated by clinical observations. The report also suggested that the protective effect of linseed against coronary heart disease may be mediated, at least in part, by its -linolenic acid content. 55. Several studies in humans, published since the release of the IEH report, have confirmed that the inclusion of soy or flaxseed in the diet can have a hypocholestolemic effect and/or reduce the ratio of plasma LDL to HDL cholesterol. Recent intervention studies (Table 4) 56. Davis et al (1998) briefly described a meta -analysis of 38 published controlled clinical trials (not referenced) of soy protein consumption which averaged at 47g per day and found that consumption of soy protein was significantly associated with mean reductions in total cholesterol (9.3%), LDL cholesterol (12.9% decrease) and triglycerides (12.9% decrease). 57. Preliminary f indings from a double-blind prospective study in which sixty subjects, previously confirmed to have adenomatous polyps or colon cancer, were given either a soy or casein (control) supplement, providing 38g protein, for 1 year, indicated that some (numbers not specified) subjects consuming soy had a reduced plasma total cholesterol level, mainly due to lower LDL and VLDL cholesterol levels. However, HDL, thyroxine and thyroid stimulating hormone were all unchanged ( Bennink et al, 1998, abstract). 58. In a p arallel-group, randomised, double-blind, intervention trial (reported by Potter et al, 1998 and Baum et al ,1998), sixty-six hypercholesterolemic, post-menopausal women, maintained on a low-fat-low- cholesterol diet, were provided with 40 g protein per day from either non-fat dry milk, isolated soy protein containing 1.39 mg isoflavones/g or isolated soy protein containing 2.25 mg isoflavones/g, for 6 mo. Significant decreases inICTU/00/04x Draft 23/02/01 An Overview of the B eneficial Effects of Phytoestrogens. Meeting 4; page 22 of 2522non-HDL cholesterol and significant increases in HDL cholesterol (P<0.05) and mononuclear cell LDL receptor mRNA (P<0.05) were seen in both isoflavone groups (P<0.05) but not in the non-fat dry milk group. 59. Significant declines in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were observed in non- hypercholestrolemic , non- hypertensive , peri-menopausal women (n=51), of soy protein containing 34 mg phytoestrogens , either as a single daily dose or split into two daily doses, for 6 weeks, compared to an iso-caloric carbohydrate placebo control diet, as part of a randomised, double-blind, cross-over trial. Also, a significant decrease in diastolic blood pressure was observed in the twice-daily soy diet ( Washburn et al, 1999). Similarly, significant reductions in LDL cholesterol and in the ratios of total cholesterol :HDL cholesterol and LDL:HDL cholesterol were reported by Merz-Demlow et al (2000) in 13 normocholersterolemic pre-menopausal women maintained on high isoflavone (~130 mg/d) diets. 60. In a study reported by Jenkins et al (1999), reductions in total plasma cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and apolipoprotein A-1, but no changes in lipoprotein ratios, were observed in 29 hyperlipidemic patients (22 men and 7 post-menopausal women), following consumption of 20 g fibre/d from flaxseed (~50g partially defatted flaxseed/d) for three weeks, compared to a wheat-bran control diet, as part of a randomised, cross-over trial. 61. Plasma total cholesterol, LDL and HDL levels tended to be decreased in middle-aged men and significantly decreased (P<0.001) in post- menopausal women when fed an estimated 27 mg/d of the lignan precursor, secoisolariciresinol , in the form of linseed incorporated into bread rolls, for 4 or 6 weeks ( Cassidy et al, 1998, abstract). In contrast, intakes of 45 mg/d of isoflavones, in the form of soy textured vegetable protein (TVP), had no effect on serum total cholesterol . Group sizes were n=12 or 13. 62. The latter two studies suggest that flaxseed or flaxseed products may be more effective than soy or soy products in the short-term. 64. Effort s have been made to identify isoflavones and lignans as the hypocholesterolemic agents present in soy and flaxseed. Findings, regarding the activity of isoflavones, have been inconsistent.ICTU/00/04x Draft 23/02/01 An Overview of the B eneficial Effects of Phytoestrogens. Meeting 4; page 23 of 252366. In a double-blind randomised parallel trial, involving male an d female hypercholesterolemic patients (n=156), Crouse et al (1999) reported an isoflavone dose-related response on the lowering plasma total and LDL cholesterol following inclusion of 25 g of soy protein isolate, containing 3, 27, 37 or 62 mg of isoflavones , in the daily diet for 9 weeks. Decreases were significant only at the top dose (P<0.05) but changes were (~ 4% and 6% for total and LDL cholesterol, respectively, relative to casein controls). However, no such dose-response was obtained by Potter et al (1998) and Baum et al (1998) and data from a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of two-way parallel design, in which 46 healthy middle-aged men and 13 post- menopausal women not receiving HRT were supplemented daily with tablets containing 55 mg of isoflavones (mainly as genistein ) for 8 weeks, showed no post-intervention differences in either serum lipid or lipoprotein (a) levels (Hodgson et al, 1998). 67. Furthermore, data from a relatively short-term placebo-controlled cross- over study, reported by Nestel et al (1997, 1999) found no change in plasma lipids in 21 menopausal and peri-menopausal women supplemented daily with 80 mg isoflavones, containing 45 mg genistein, over a period of 5 or 10 weeks (although there was a significant improvement (26%, P<0.001) in systemic arterial compliance when compared with placebo controls). Red wine 68. There is epidemiological evidence to suggest that the consumption of red wine may help to prevent coronary heart disease. Proposed mechanisms have included an increase in HDL cholesterol, reduction/inhibition of platelet aggregation, reduction of clotting factor concentrations, reduced thromboxane synthesis, increased vasodilatory prostacyclin synthesis, inhibition of LDL oxidation and free radical scavenging. The responsible constituents of wine are unknown but may be attributed to a variety of antioxidants present, including the phytoestrogen resveratrol ( Das et al, 1999 and references therein). Animal studies 69. Recent studies in animals have also be en inconsistent. Anthony et al (1997) showed that a diet containing intact soy was the most effective and a diet containing casein the least effective in improving LDL and HDL profiles, inICTU/00/04x Draft 23/02/01 An Overview of the B eneficial Effects of Phytoestrogens. Meeting 4; page 24 of 2524young male cynomolgus monkey fed an atherogenic diet. Diet containing alcohol-extracted soy had an intermediate effect but did not differ significantly from the casein group. It could not be determined whether any beneficial effects of the diet containing alcohol-extracted soy were due to the protein itself or residual traces of isoflavones. In addition, Nogowski et al (1998) reported that supplementation of diet with genistein, up to 0.1%, resulted in significant reductions of serum and muscle triglycerides, increases in free fatty acids and diminished plasma and increased hepatic cholesterol in ovariectomised rats. 70. In contrast, a study in ovariectomised cynomolgus monkeys demonstrated that although a diet consisting of soy protein improved the lipid and lipoprotein profile, a diet consisting of semi-purified extract of soy, rich in isoflavones, added to casein- lactalbumin protein did not ( Greaves et al, 1999). These results could not be explained by any differences in absorption of isoflavones from the two diets. Furthermore, a study in gerbils suggested that consumption of an isoflavone containing extract from soy does not contribute to the hypocholesterolemic effect of alcohol-extracted soy, but may influence lipid metabolism by altering expression for lipid-related genes, illustrated by the down regulation of hepatic apolipoprotein mRNA been demonstrated ( Prasad, 1997; Prasad et al, 1998) and attributed to the -linolenic acid and/or lignan constituents. Further to this, the lignan, secoisolariciresinol diglucoside , was found to be active in reducing hypercholesterolemic atheroslerosis in rabbits when added to a high- cholesterol diet. The effect was associated with decreases in serum total and LDL cholesterol and atherosclerosis-associated aortic oxidative stress and an increase in HDL cholesterol and aortic antioxidant reserve ( Prasad, 1999). Summary and conclusions 72. In summary, the available data from human studies cannot confirm whether or not isoflavones are responsible for the hypocholesterolemic effects of soy. It has been suggested that inconsistencies in the data may be attributed to differences in study duration, the levels of supplementation, the form of the supplement, the method of soy extraction, and the use of normal versus hypercholestolemic subjects. However, data obtained from animalICTU/00/04x Draft 23/02/01 An Overview of the B eneficial Effects of Phytoestrogens. Meeting 4; page 25 of 2525studies suggest isoflavones either play no role or are only partly involved in the soy-associated lowering of plasma total cholesterol and/or LDL :HDL cholesterol ratio, but they may play a role in altering lipid metabolism. 73. It is possible that the hypocholesterolemic effect of soy may be partly due to the interaction of isoflavones and some other component in soy but not always present in extracts or extracted preparations. Future studies warrant full analysis of soy-alcohol extracts to determine the constituents removed from the intact soy. REPORTS OF OTHER BENEFICIAL EFFECTS 74. Effects in hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) patients Korzenick et al (1998, abstract) - An uncontrolled pilot study (8 patients) to evaluate the efficacy of isolated soy protein in the treatment of chronic epistaxis (nosebleeds) and gastro -intestinal haemorrhage in patients with HHT (the study was prompted by the suggestion that the pathophysiology of HHT is due to a dysregulation of angiogenesis which is shown to be inhibited by genistein ). Patients were given a soy protein beverage ( isoflavone content 72 mg including 40 mg of genistein), twice daily for 3 mo. Of the 6 patients who had previously exhibited epistaxis, three showed complete or near resolution and a fourth showed some improvement. One of three patients with gastrointestinal bleeding showed a marked improvement in terms of increased haematocrit and 4 patients reported complete relief from migraines. OVERALL CONCLUSIONS 75. There is some evidence to suggest that the consumption of diets high in soy, and therefore containing high levels of phytoestrogenic isoflavones, or soy supplements may be associated with a decreased risk in breast cancer, particularly in pre-menopausal women. Animal studies support the notion that the phytoestrogens themselves may be active anti-breast cancer components. However, supporting human data are lacking. Data concerning the relationship between lignans and breast cancer risk are very limited.ICTU/00/04x Draft 23/02/01 An Overview of the B eneficial Effects of Phytoestrogens. Meeting 4; page 26 of 252676. A limited number of studies have recently suggested that there may be an inverse association between risk of prostate cancer and consumption of soy products and foods containing high levels of coumestrol. Clinical evidence to support this is absent. However, there is some evidence to suggest that diets supplemented with concentrates of soy phytochemicals or soy isoflavones may inhibit the development of implanted, spontaneous and chemically-induced tumours of the prostate in rodents. 77. There is no evidence available from human studies to attribute the protective effect of fibre, fruit and vegetables, against risk of colorectal and stomach cancer, to their phytoestrogen content. 78. There is little or no evidence to associate phytoestrogen intake with a reduced risk of with cancer of the endometrium, ovary or lung. 79. Reports of the effect of supplementation of isoflavones or soy extracts on relief of menopausal symptoms are variable. Data available from full publications are inconsistent and often hampered by high placebo effects, although this may be due to high dietary intake of phytoestrogens in the control groups. Much of the data are available only as preliminary reports in abstract form and while these studies seem promising, confirmation of the outcomes of these studies must await full publication. 80. There is reasonably convincing data to support the notion that phytoestrogens can provide effective protection against bone loss in rodents. Furthermore, the synthetic isoflavone, ipriflavone, has been shown to be clinically effective, although its action is not through any estrogenicity. However, clinical data on the protective effects of natural isoflavones and other phytoestrogens are sparse. Any beneficial effects have been relatively small and the site of action has been limited. 81. There is a strong suggestion that diets containing soy and flax can have a hypocholesterolemic effect and can reduce the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in humans. However, it is not possible to attribute this protection to the phytoestrogen content with any certainty. 82. The usefulness of data from the many epidemiology studies in assessing the beneficial effects of phytoestrogens is limited by the fact thatICTU/00/04x Draft 23/02/01 An Overview of the B eneficial Effects of Phytoestrogens. Meeting 4; page 27 of 2527many have been conducted in soy consuming populations and may be confounded by ethnic differences. Furthermore, studies involving women have not always distinguished between the pre-and post-menopausal state. Little attention has been given to the possible interaction with other dietary and constitutional factors. There are very limited data available concerning the effects of lignans, from either human or animal studies. Intervention studies have often been of a limited size and duration. In several cases, full details of the study methods and data are not yet available. Thus, while in vitro studies (not reviewed here) and investigations in animals may provide a persuasive argument for the positive effects of phytoestrogens in many diseased states, clinical data, definitively supporting the claimed beneficial health effects of these substances in humans, are still wanting.
