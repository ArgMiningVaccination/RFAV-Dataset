Nutritional Therapy is based on the concept that real health can be achieved through a holistic and bio-individual approach to nutrition and lifestyle. With a 'food as medicine' approach, Nutritional Therapy focuses on the importance of a properly prepared, nutrient-dense, whole food diet in conjunction with a well-balanced lifestyle. Our holistic practitioners understand the significance of honoring the body's own feedback system and its' capacity to restore, regenerate, and correct itself \u2014 when given the tools and nutrients to do so. In combination with our Clinical Herbalists our team will be able to guide and support a journey of health as it revolves around the food we eat. Nutritional Therapy, in combination with other preventative modalities, could be the solution to our current health crisis as we work to treat the root cause rather than one specific pain point to provide 360 health and wellness.

Met with Kim for a consultation and she was so supportive of my needs and in providing suggestions to address my needs. Definitely feels like a safe and supportive community. Can't wait to start my classes and services! - Beverly Health is about the individual and the individuals needs. They took the time to learn my unique needs, my goals, and my willingness for change. They provided a holistic solution in ways modern medicine hasn't. I am excited to have a sanctuary to go to for professional help being the best me that I can be. - George After trying for years to use traditional massage, chiropractic and neurological services to address my chronic back pain and anxiety, I tried treatments at Saffron & Sage and have never looked back. For the last 8 months I have been seeing Ashley and Ana who have literally and figuratively taken weight off of my shoulders and have allowed me to feel better than I ever have in my life. I combine a hand curated combination of Acupuncture, Cupping, Stretching and Massage on a monthly basis to manage both my back pain and anxiety issues. Ashley and Ana (plus the entire staff) are incredibly compassionate and are always looking for ways to help me on my journey for a more comfortable life. They take a genuine interest in my well-being and I truly view them as partners and friends. I would highly recommend that anyone who has tried 'traditional' remedies to their health issues and isn't seeing results to come in for a consultation to see how the incredibly talented staff at Saffron & Sage can help you. They offer countless services and programs designed to address anything that might be ailing you. Their ability to listen, read between the lines and develop customized plans for every individual is simply something I have never experienced with other practitioners. They are some of the best people I've had the pleasure of meeting and will continue to advocate for them and the business. Not to mention, their space is light and refreshing and they have the best house dog (Harper) on the planet. Give these folks a shot if you seriously want to address your health (physical, spiritual, mental, etc.) and feel better. - Evan I loved it !!! I found what I was looking for here !! If wot so comfortable and at peace at saffron, I had my free consultation with Kimberly and she was amazing !!! I felt an immediate connection... and the location is amazing !! Really happy that I found this place and also they've ace great pricing. - Viridiana One of the best things I have ever done was follow Saffron & Sage on instagram and make an appointment for a consultation. Christin, the owner, instantly made me feel so comfortable. I left on a high, feeling so happy and excited to have found this gem. I can't wait to try ALL the classes, start acupuncture, and try cupping! If you're thinking about trying Saffron & Sage I HIGHLY recommend it! You can do a consultation appointment for free and figure out if it's for you. - Taylor "}
