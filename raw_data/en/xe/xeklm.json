But the culprit this semester \u2014 in addition to the ever-present COVID-19 \u2014 is monkeypox. Typical college experiences such as living in dorms and attending crowded parties could provide the perfect environment for transmission of the monkeypox virus, which spreads through skin-to-skin contact and contact with contaminated clothing and bedding. [Dallas County](https://www.dallascounty.org/departments/dchhs/monkeypox.php) has the largest portion of [Texas' 815 cases](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/response/2022/us-map.html), reporting 265 confirmed and 45 suspected cases as of Tuesday. Tarrant County reported 65 cases as of Thursday. Preventive vaccines are [in short supply](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2022/08/02/dallas-expands-monkeypox-vaccine-eligibility-but-some-are-frustrated-at-limited-access/) and available only to a few high-risk groups. That means colleges and universities have to lean on other public health measures, including virus education and planned outbreak responses, to limit the impact of monkeypox. \"Places of communal living where people are going to be in close contact with each other have the potential to be the focus of an outbreak, so it's important now before colleges matriculate to have a plan in place both for prevention as well as for dealing with an outbreak,\" said Dr. Jill Weatherhead, assistant professor of pediatrics, tropical medicine and infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine. Most institutions have created dedicated pages on their websites with basic information about the virus, testing availability on campus and instructions for those who may have symptoms, but many are still waiting for the semester to inch closer before sending out mass emails about it. Because the virus is relatively new, Kizuwanda Grant, the chief administrative officer at Paul Quinn College, said the school has not created a stand-alone protocol response for monkeypox. Instead, the college is using what it's learned throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Some students started moving into campus last week and are receiving a supply of masks, hand sanitizer and other disinfecting products, but Grant isn't sure how weary they are about the virus. \"College students do not always pay close attention to these types of things, and so it's not forefront in their minds,\" Grant said. The University of Texas at Dallas emailed students Tuesday with information about both monkeypox and COVID-19. The email listed possible symptoms of the virus and directed students who suspect they have monkeypox to contact the Student Health Center or another primary care provider for further information. Officials at Collin College have only shared updates related to COVID-19 for the fall semester. Like at many other institutions, they have not shared any detailed plans for contact tracing in case of a monkeypox outbreak on campus. Dallas College officials said they're monitoring the local spread of monkeypox in the city but are referring faculty and staff to federal, state and county resources \"for information on symptoms, prevention, treatment and vaccines\" for the virus. Students already worn down by years of COVID overshadowing their time in college are nervous about what this new virus means for their next semester. Chyna Dillard, a senior vocal performance major at the University of Texas at Arlington, is excited to begin her last year in school, move into her new apartment and start singing in the campus a cappella choir. But her eagerness is clouded when she thinks of how close she'll be to other people in class and as part of a vocal ensemble. \"Spit travels,\" Dillard, 22, said. \"It's very possible that I might get that kind of contact, like spit or just touching or getting skin-to-skin contact, so hopefully they take that into consideration when we do have performances and rehearsal.\" While monkeypox can move through respiratory droplets, the virus doesn't spread easily by air. It is much more likely to be transmitted through close contact. Dillard said she hopes the school makes an intentional effort to sanitize common areas after students leave. Monkeypox symptoms usually start within three weeks of exposure to the virus. Some people develop flu-like symptoms before getting the virus' telltale rash that can look like blisters or pimples. The rash has to go through several stages, including scabbing over, before a monkeypox infection is done. A person is considered no longer contagious only after all scabs have fallen off and fresh skin has formed, a process that can take between two and four weeks. [Dallas County declares monkeypox outbreak a health emergency](/news/public-health/2022/08/05/dallas-county-declares-emergency-due-to-monkeypox-outbreak/) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises that people with monkeypox isolate until their rash has healed, although isolation may be difficult for students living in dorms or apartments. The current monkeypox outbreak has had few transmissions within households, which may mean the virus is not spreading as easily through materials as it is through skin-to-skin contact, said Catherine Troisi, an infectious disease epidemiologist with the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. \"There is theoretical concern about spreading in college campuses, because people do share clothing, they may sleep in another's bed, they might share towels in the bathroom,\" she said. \"We're just not sure whether that's going to be a significant risk of this monkeypox.\" Back-to-school jitters Already, at least one positive monkeypox case has been confirmed within the University of Texas at Austin campus community, according to [The Daily Texan](https://thedailytexan.com/2022/07/17/monkeypox-case-confirmed-in-ut-austin-community/), its student paper. In a campus-wide email sent by University of North Texas leaders on Thursday, officials acknowledged concerns about the virus and said they're closely monitoring caseloads in nearby counties. \"We understand that news of a new infectious disease on top of the last few years of the COVID-19 pandemic can be concerning and result in feelings of anxiety and uncertainty,\" wrote Jessica Rangel, the executive vice president of health systems at the UNT Health Science Center at Fort Worth. Olivia Cloer, a sophomore majoring in media arts and English at UNT, said she doesn't know how concerned she should be about monkeypox as the fall semester approaches. \"I'm a little bit worried,\" she said. \"None of us really know a whole lot about it.\" Once classes start, Cloer said she plans on wearing a mask and keeping her distance from others, something that she said will be hard to do on campus. UTD pointed out in its message to students that \"the general threat of monkeypox to the public is currently considered low.\" On-campus clinicians at Texas A&M University have gone through training on the virus since the outbreak was first confirmed in May, but Martha Dannenbaum, the university's director of student health services, doesn't want students to panic. \"Worrying doesn't really help anything,\" she said. \"We want our students to be mindful of their health and that there are many things that can happen ... just be thoughtful.\" Instead, Dannenbaum recommends students be proactive about protecting themselves from exposure by educating themselves on the virus as well as other, more prevalent infections such as chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis. Monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted illness, but, because it is spread through skin-to-skin contact, the virus can be passed between people during intimate interactions. Texas Tech University has published one of the most detailed guides for students on how to limit their exposure to monkeypox when having sex. The guide also details individual behaviors that can lessen the spread of the virus at parties, raves and clubs. \"Festivals, events and concerts where attendees are fully clothed and unlikely to share skin-to-skin contact are safer,\" the [page](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/studenthealth/SocialGatheringsaferSexandMonkeypox/) reads. \"However, attendees should be mindful of activities (like kissing) that might spread monkeypox.\" The monkeypox virus can infect anyone, regardless of sexual orientation. But the current outbreak's spread among men who have sex with men has attached an inaccurate stigma to the virus that campus LGBT organizations are already preparing to combat. Chase Mueller, president of Pride at UTD, said he and other group members are particularly concerned after a [UTD professor posted a homophobic tweet](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/education/2022/07/19/lgbt-students-denounce-ut-dallas-professor-who-wants-a-cure-for-homosexuality/) related to monkeypox cases in New York. Education on what monkeypox is and how it spreads will hopefully mitigate misinformation about the virus, Mueller said. \"We're trying to discuss ... how to make sure that this doesn't become another situation where it starts to run rampant not only in the gay community, but especially in other communities because people will dismiss symptoms if they're not gay men or sexually active gay men,\" he said. For now, students and health experts are cautiously hopeful that monkeypox won't disrupt college life. \"The modes of transportation of the virus are different than COVID-19, so I believe we have a little bit of a better chance to contain it,\" Mueller said. \"We really need to try and make sure there's enough spacing in classes and at campus events so there's no direct skin-to-skin contact.\" [Worried about monkeypox?
