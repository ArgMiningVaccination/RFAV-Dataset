Immune cells found in individuals previously exposed to common cold coronaviruses enhance the body's immune response to SARS-CoV-2, during both natural infection and vaccination, the results of a new study show. \"During infections with the more harmless coronaviruses, the immune system builds up a kind of protective 'universal coronavirus' memory,\" Claudia Giesecke-Thiel, MD, Head of the Flow Cytometry Service Group at the MPIMG, said in a statement. \"Once exposed to SARS-CoV-2, these memory cells are reactivated and kick-start the response against the new pathogen. This could help accelerate the initial immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and limit viral propagation during the early stages of the infection and is therefore likely to have a positive effect on the course of the disease.\" The data confirm that T helper cells generated memory capability to deal with harmless common cold coronaviruses, which will also attack structural similar coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2. This cross-reactive immunity could be a reason that there is a severity difference among individuals and may show why vaccine efficacy varies among age groups. The quality of the immune response was linked to the quality of cross-reactive cells that were present in the individual before infection. \"Infection with an endemic coronavirus represents a benefit in younger people, helping them fight off SARS-CoV-2 or develop immunity following vaccination. Sadly, this benefit is less pronounced in older adults,\" Andreas Thiel, an investigator based at a joint research space of Charit\u00e9 and Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin and the BIH Center for Regenerative Therapies said in the statement. \"It is likely that a third [or booster] dose would be able to compensate for this weaker immune response, ensuring that members of this high-risk group have adequate immunity.\" Reference Prior exposure to common cold coronaviruses enhances immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
