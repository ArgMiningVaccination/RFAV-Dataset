A handful of meetings were held over the next few years. Around 2018 (??) DIFM established the position of Mind-Body Therapies Chair, and Anu Kaur stepped into the role. Pamela Malo joined as co-chair in 2020, and then Anu stepped down in 2022 to pursue her doctorate. Monique Richard, former DIFM Chair, has served as a regular support and collaborator. With the explosion in the research and DIFM's support, this movement of dietitians integrating mind-body modalities is at an exciting threshold of possibility. 312 RDs filled out the mind-body RD survey launched in the summer of 2022. - Goals [Drafted by Pamela and Monique- input form all is welcome] - Create a NETWORK of mind-body RD practitioners who are the leaders in the field - Create a Mind-Body RD DIRECTORY - Offer EVENTS to other RD professionals and the general public - Hold quarterly meetings - for networking, development, etc - Create RESOURCES - ie, toolkits & handouts (a few are in progress!) - Utilize a SHARED LEADERSHIP model (vs. hierarchical) with rotating roles, (meeting leader, note taker, etc) and all able to ask/offer help - Have FUN.
