But with all of the shared feasts and seemingly always available treats and munchies, it is all too easy to overindulge, setting o all forms of digestive discomfort. Add to that disrupted routines, travel, and stress, this busy time of year can throw an otherwise healthy gut for a loop. Rather than reaching for OTC antacids or other meds with negative side e ects, consider trying some of these e ective dietary supplements rst. Everyone is a little di erent, so experiment a little to nd out what works best for you and your speci c symptoms. GENERAL SUPPORT & MAINTENANCE/T_h ere are some supplements that provide general support no matter what your speci c digestive upset may be. Even if you rarely experience gastrointestinal distress, they are bene cial in maintaining good gut health; they are especially important if you frequently experience GI upset. Probiotics. Our guts are home to approximately 100 trillion microbes which heavily infl uence not only digestive health, but our overall health as well. Unfortunately, our modern lives directly contribute to unhealthy gut fl ora\u2014antibiotics and other medications, poor diets, stress, and illness can cause dysbiosis, or imbalance, in gut bacteria, compromising digestion and eventually, overall health. A probiotic supplement is essential for promoting a healthy balance of bacteria in our guts. Look for one with a variety of strains that may include B. bi dum, L. casei, L. acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. rhamnosus , and B. Follow label instructions.L VE Your Gut!

Our digestive systems don't absorb food\u2014 they absorb nutrients. But in order to absorb nutrients, the food we eat has to be completely broken down. In perfect health, our bodies produce di erent types of digestive enzymes to break down speci c types of food (protease to breakdown protein; amylase to break down carbs; and lipase to break down fats, etc.), but a number of factors\u2014chronic illness, age, low stomach acid, stress\u2014can reduce the body's natural production of these enzymes. Digestive enzyme supplements ensure that food is fully broken down, promoting normal digestion and nutrient absorption. Try a full-spectrum enzyme that contains protease, amylase, and lipase. Follow label instructions. L-Glutamine. Optimal digestion occurs when there is a balance between the secretion of stomach acid and a healthy mucosal lining. /T_h e amino acid glutamine is one of the most e ective natural compounds to maintain the structural integrity of the intestinal mucosal lining, in part by acting as a major source of fuel for the cells that makeup the mucosa, keeping them healthy and functioning properly. Supplementation has been shown to accelerate mucosal healing and decrease gut permeability. Try 3 to 5 grams of glutamine powder in water twice daily. A WORLD OF DIGESTIVE HURT (AND HOW TO STOP IT) Digestive discomfort can hit you in a myriad of ways\u2014 heartburn and indigestion, needling gas pains, uncomfortable bloating, and constipation. Each is terrible in its own right, but all are typically traced back to some common root causes: the wrong kinds of foods, eating too quickly, eating too much, drinking large amounts of alcohol or ca eine, stress, anxiety. Common sense goes a long way\u2014slow down when you eat, eat smaller portions, avoid drinking too much alcohol, and take steps to manage your stress. But when this doesn't work, and you feel the hurt coming on, having a \"digestive stress kit\" with a few select supplements on hand can really help. Deglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL) is a demulcent, that is, it soothes and infl amed mucous membranes and can increase mucous production in the gut. It is used to relieve pain and discomfort caused by indigestion, heartburn, and stomach ulcers. It can o/f_t en bring quick relief if you are su ering from heartburn or indigestion. Try 300-500 mg of the standardized extract daily, or try the chewable DGL tablets for rapid relief. Although it may seem counterintuitive, indigestion, heartburn, and excessive gas and burping may be symptoms of too little stomach acid. In one doctor's practice, 90 percent of patients tested had low stomach acid. If you don't have su cient stomach acid, you will not properly digest your food, leading to all sorts of digestive ills. For gentle support, try digestive bitters that naturally stimulate normal stomach acid and enzyme production, supporting normal digestion. Follow label instructions. Betaine HCL and pepsin provide stronger support to rebalance stomach acid production. Follow label instructions. Note: If you are taking any anti-infl ammatory drugs, including corticosteroids or NSAIDS (aspirin, ibuprofen, etc.), do not take betaine HCL due to an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and ulcers. Fennel is a carminative (others include peppermint , anise , and caraway )\u2014a compound that expels gas and reduces cramps by relaxing the smooth muscle lining of the digestive tract. Carminatives are traditionally used for gas, bloating, and indigestion, and in fact, at the turn of the 20th century, fennel was an o cial drug used to treat indigestion in the U.S. Try an herbal tincture (follow label instructions) or a tea that contains carminative herbs following a meal. One of the number one digestive complaints in the U.S. is constipation. Magnesium has a gentle laxative e ect by drawing water into the intestines, making stools so/f_t er and easier to pass. It is also essential for muscle relaxation and can help to relax intestinal muscles, promoting motility, or movement, of digested food through the digestive tract. Magnesium de ciencies are rampant in this country, and low magnesium has been associated with a higher prevalence of constipation. Try an e ervescent powder or 200-400 mg of magnesium citrate twice daily. Probiotics (Bi dobacterium lactis in particular) have been shown to increase the frequency of bowel movements, improve stool consistency, and reduce bloating in adults with constipation. Look for a multi-strain formula that contains B. lactis . During this season of parties, celebrations, and overindulgence, be prepared with a few select supplements so you can enjoy the festivities without being sidelined with digestive distress.

But melatonin goes beyond helping us get our z's and has the capacity to help the nearly 20 to 30 percent of the population who su er from gastro-esophageal refl ux disease, or GERD. As its name suggests, \"gastro- esophageal\" literally means \"stomach and esophagus, \" and in GERD su erers, the muscle at the bottom of the esophagus\u2014the lower esophageal sphincter\u2014relaxes too much and contents from the stomach leak into the esophagus. /T_h is causes frequent, severe heartburn or regurgitation, and can cause infl ammation of the esophagus. Other symptoms may include burning in the throat, a bad taste in the mouth, and trouble swallowing. People who have GERD o/f_t en feel very full and sometimes nauseous. Many people rely on acid-blocking and acid- reducing drugs to control symptoms, but these drugs are not meant to be used long-term and come with serious side e ects. Enter melatonin. It has been calculated that the gastrointestinal tract contains at least 400 times more melatonin than the pineal gland\u2014the area in the brain where it is produced at peak levels during the night. In the GI tract, it plays a key role in protecting the mucous membrane layer of the stomach\u2014the gastric mucosa\u2014from damage. More importantly for GERD su erers, melatonin has an inhibitory e ect on gastric acid secretion, namely hydrochloric acid (HCL) and pepsin, an enzyme that is the principal digestive component of gastric juice. It also inhibits nitric oxide production, a compound that relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter, leading to refl ux in those with GERD. When taking melatonin for GERD, consider this: studies show that the recommended dosage, ranging from 3mg to 6mg, is actually duration dependent. For example, those treated with melatonin for just four weeks showed incomplete improvement of GERD symptoms, while patients treated with melatonin for eight weeks had complete improvement of GERD symptoms. Even at 40 days, one study reported that participants taking a combination supplement containing melatonin (along with several B vitamins and betaine) had complete regression of GERD symptoms, without signi cant side e ects\u2014compared to only 66 percent in the group receiving a commonly prescribed acid-suppressing medication. Of the nearly 60 percent of the adult population who will experience some form of GERD symptoms within a 12 month period, 80 percent say they have a reduced enjoyment of food, 60 percent report sleep problems, and 40 percent have concentration di culties during an attack. But su ering with GERD doesn't have to be a lifelong battle! Taking melatonin alone or in combination with lifestyle and dietary changes, is a natural approach that may just make this debilitating digestive disorder a thing of the past.Melatonin for GERD E ective help from an unlikely source By Liz MuellerNutrition Now\u00ae WishGarden\u00ae */T_h ese statements have not been evaluated by the FDA. /T_h ese products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.

Oral antibiotics disrupt the bene cial bacteria that inhabit our guts, leading to diarrhea and other digestive issues. /T_h ey interfere with the absorption of some B vitamins. And a 2013 study found that some antibiotics damaged normal cells. I have long suspected that antibiotics also play a role in the obesity epidemic, an e ect that may be ampli ed with the consumption of junk foods. In the 1940s and 1950s, scientists discovered that antibiotics increased weight gain in farm animals, including chickens, cattle, and hogs. /T_h is nding spurred the addition of antibiotics to their feed. Bigger animals meant\u2014and still mean\u2014bigger pro ts. \"But what if that meat is us?\" asked the writer of a recent New York Times article titled \"/T_h e Fat Drug. \" At least three studies conducted in the 1950s\u2014studies that probably could not be ethically done today\u2014found that children and adults did gain more weight when they took antibiotics. My hunch is that the e ects of antibiotics on growth and weight are more pronounced when the drugs are given to infants and children. It could be that the alteration of gut bacteria changes metabolism for life. Recent animal studies seem to support my thinking. We certainly have plenty of reasons to be concerned and to be more judicious in our use of antibiotics. -JCAntibiotics andObesity Vitamin D Levels May IMPROVE BREAST CANCER SURVIVALAn analysis of ve studies has found that women with higher blood levels of vitamin D live much longer a/f_t er treatment for breast cancer, compared with those who had low levels of the vitamin. Cedric F. Garland, DrPH, of the University of California, San Diego, and his colleagues conducted a statistical analysis of data from the ve studies, which included 4,443 patients. Women who had an average vitamin D blood level of 30 ng/ml were classi ed as having a \"high\" level of the vitamin, whereas women who averaged 17 ng/ml were classi ed as having a low level. In the statistical analysis, Garland divided the women into ve groups, depending on their level of vitamin D. Women who had the highest concentrations of vitamin D had half the death rate of those with the lowest levels of the vitamin. Garland noted that a 2007 study found that people taking 1,000 IU of vitamin D, plus calcium, had a 77 percent lower incidence of any type of invasive cancer, including breast cancer. Editor's note: A vitamin D blood level of 30 ng/ml is not \"high\" by any stretch of the imagination. Although it is better than 17 ng/ml, it is still marginally de cient. /T_h e minimum optimal level of vitamin D is 45 ng/ml, which is needed to activate the biochemical processes dependent on the vitamin. Most people will need 4,000 to 5,000 IU of vitamin D daily to achieve a blood level of 45 to 50 ng/ml. Cancer patients may very well need higher levels of the vitamin Reference: Mohr S, Gorham ED, Kim J, et al.

Anticancer Research , 2014;34:1163-1166Quick Reviews of Recent Research Curcumin helpful in rheumatoid arthritis Physicians at the Normala Medical Center, India, treated 45 patients with rheumatoid arthritis. /T_h ey were given 50 mg of diclofenac sodium (an anti-infl ammatory drug), 500 mg of curcumin, or a combination of both. All three patient groups improved, but the curcumin group showed the greatest improvement in two tests to assess the severity of rheumatoid arthritis. Chandran B. Phytotherapy Research , 2012;26:1719-1725. Vitamin D may reduce mortality Researchers at Guangdong Medical College, China, analyzed 42 controlled studies of people taking vitamin D supplements. Vitamin D reduced the risk of death by 6 percent, but only in people who took vitamin D supplements for three or more years. Many other studies have shown that high vitamin D levels are associated with a lower risk of cancer and heart disease, which would reduce mortality. Zheng Y .

Breakfast linked to physical activity in kids Eating breakfast is related to increased physical activity, according to a study of 860 adolescent boys and girls. Researchers from Cambridge University and other institutions tracked moderate and vigorous physical activity in the adolescents. Participants who engaged in more physical activity were more likely to have eaten breakfast. Adolescents who did not always eat breakfast had higher levels of physical activity on the days they did eat breakfast. Corder K.

It's a precursor to glutathione, the body's own powerful antioxidant and it has been shown to signi cantly reduce fl u symptoms. NAC is also used in hospitals to treat acetaminophen overdose and to break up mucus in the lungs. Previous research has shown that NAC can also bene t people with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), which is a combination of chronic bronchitis and emphysema. A new year-long study shows that those bene ts can be sustained over the long term. Hoi Nam Tse, MBChB, along with colleagues at the Kwong Wah Hospital in Hong Kong, analyzed data from a study that included 120 people with stable COPD. /T_h e patients were mostly men with an average age of 70 years. /T_h ey took 600 mg of NAC or placebos twice daily for one year. A battery of tests at the beginning and end of the study measured their lung function. Patients taking NAC bene ted from a 25 to 75 percent improvement in \"forced expiratory fl ow, \" a measure of lung function. /T_h ey also had a 44 percent decrease in the average number of exacerbations in COPD symptoms.

Miller, PhD, of the Center for Epidemiology, Biostatistic, and Computational Biology at the consulting rm Exponent, Inc., Chicago, and her colleagues analyzed 70 published studies, some of which involved supplements and others that simply looked at dietary levels of the omega-3s. Overall, Miller found that omega-3s reduced systolic blood pressure by an average of 1.52 mm Hg and diastolic pressure by 0.99 mm Hg. However, people not treated with drugs bene ted the most, with an average 4.51 decrease in systolic blood pressure and a 2.83 reduction in diastolic pressure. Miller and her colleagues wrote that omega- 3s lower systolic blood pressure, but only amounts greater than 2 grams daily reduced diastolic pressure.

But a new study has found that the disease may be treated with probiotic supplements. Hossein Poustchi, PhD, of the Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Iran, and his colleagues treated 52 patients with the disease, giving them either two probiotic or placebo capsules daily for 28 weeks. /T_h e probiotics contained seven common strains of friendly Lactobacillus, Bi dobacteria , and Streptococcus bacteria. Levels of the liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT) decreased in both the probiotic and placebo groups, but the reduction in ALT levels decreased far more in the probiotic group. In addition, levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) also decreased far more in the probiotic group compared with the placebo group. /T_h ese decreases in ALT and AST refl ected improved liver function. In addition, levels of C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and nuclear factor kappa beta also declined in the probiotic group\u2014signs of less liver infl ammation.

Qureshi, MBBS, of Pakistan's National Institute of Blood Disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, and his colleagues reported their ndings of 86 patients who underwent treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). /T_h e patients ranged from 1 to 60 with an average of 24 years of age. More than 90 percent of the patients were de cient in vitamin D before treatment, with the severity of de ciency being great in ALL patients. A/f_t er chemotherapy, vitamin D levels in the patients declined even further. Editor's note: /T_h is is a signi cant study that likely is relevant to patients receiving chemotherapy for other types of cancer. It is not clear, however, what speci cally caused the decline in vitamin D levels. It could be related to the chemotherapy, or it could be a lack of appetite or outdoor activity with chemo-related side e ects. Reference: Naz A, Qureshi RN.

Analysis of Studies Finds that OMEGA-3's REDUCE Blood PressureLiver Disease Responds to Probiotic SupplementsChemotherapy Appears to Reduce Vitamin D Levels-acetylcysteine Improves Breathing in People with COPD N AFTER chemotherapy, VITAMIN D LEVELS in the patients DECLINED An estimated 5 million American men and women su er from dry eye syndrome in the United States. /T_h e most common treatment is arti cial tears, but they provide incomplete and only temporary relief. Because infl ammation of the eye's surface plays a role in the disorder, Rahul Bhargava, MD, of the Santosh Medical College and Hospital, India, and his colleagues conducted a study using omega-3 sh oils as the treatment. Bhargava asked 264 patients with dry eye to take either omega-3 capsules or placebos twice daily for three months. Each capsule contained 325 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 175 mg of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), adding up to 650 mg of EPA and 350 mg of DHA daily. Patients underwent four eye exams during the study. A/f_t er three months, 65 percent of the patients taking omega-3s had signi cant improvements in dry eye symptoms, compared with only 33 percent of those taking placebos. \"Omega-3 fatty acids modulate the infl ammatory process in the body and nutritional supplementation may have a promising role to play in dry eye. Dietary intervention with omega-3 fatty acid not only causes symptomatic improvement but betters clinical markers of dry eye... \" wrote Bhargava and his colleagues.

While the oil is heating, combine the onion, tapioca fl our, and salt in a bowl and toss until well coated. Drop one slice of onion into the oil; if it sizzles immediately, the oil is ready. Working in batches, gently drop the onion slices into the hot oil and cook until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes per batch, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. Remove the onion slices from the oil using a fork and set on a paper towel to drain. Repeat with the remaining onions. Make the green beans: Bring the water to a boil in a large saucepan. Add the green beans, return the water to a boil, and cook for 10 minutes. Drain the beans. In a small casserole dish, combine the green beans, mushroom gravy, and crumbled bacon.

Parts of them might have once come from a farm, but more than likely they're the result of genetic modi cation (including nearly all corn and soy products in the United States), industrial-scale processing, and careful development by food technologists. If the ingredient list takes up half the label and you don't recognize most of what's on the list, then you're probably better o not eating it. OPT FOR ORGANIC FOODS Organic foods are grown without chemicals and GMOs and with farming methods that sustain soil quality. Until around 60 years ago, virtually all farming was organic, although no one used the term. It wasn't until World War II that DDT (the rst modern pesticide) was developed. Since then, agribusiness has developed scores of new pesticides, synthetic fertilizers, and more recently genetically engineered seeds to tolerate high applications of herbicides, speci cally glyphosate. In August this year the New England Journal of Medicine published an editorial criticizing the use of genetically engineered plants to withstand high doses of glyphosate (Roundup\u00ae), a probable carcinogen. A number of studies have found glyphosate and other pesticide residues in the urine of adults and children. One of the easiest ways to avoid these chemicals is to choose organic.Want to get healthy? /T_h ere is no better time than now.

GET A NUTRITION HEALTH WORKUP When you plan a trip, you have a starting point and a destination. Getting a nutrition health workup is like having a personal map to guide you on your journey to health. Nutritionally oriented doctors o/f_t en begin by doing a dietary assessment and measuring their patients' blood levels of vitamins, minerals, omega-3s, and other nutrients. /T_h e results will show what you need to improve or don't, saving you money and helping you focus on the real gaps in your health. For example, if a workup shows you have su cient vitamin D, you don't have to take that supplement. Having had such nutrition workups, I can tell you they o/f_t en yield unexpected results. Nutritionists, nutritional therapists, dietitians, and nutritional health coaches (NHCs) can help you develop a plan for better eating habits and which supplements you need.

Ditto for unhealthy food relationships. And it's still worse when unhealthy foods are intertwined with an unhealthy personal relationship, and the best dietary intentions get sabotaged. Some research has found that overweight people tend to socialize with other overweight people, all gorging on a lot of unhealthy food. If any of this describes you, know that you can rise above it all. Making permanent changes to your health and lifestyle might mean changing your social life, a change that could be long overdue. COUNTER STRESS IN A STRESS-FILLED WORLD Got stress? Seems like everyone does these days, what with work, commuting, home life, and relationships. When we're stressed, it's hard to think of not being stressed, which is why it is so important to create a \"reset button\" of sorts as a reminder to de-stress. Sometimes a 10-minute time out does the trick, and calming music, a brief meditation, walking up and down the stairs, guided visualization, even daydreaming can help tremendously. Several supplements have been found to help reduce stress, in part because they support neurotransmitters that get used up during periods of constant stress. Among them are a high-potency B-complex (50 mg of the major B vitamins, or a daily multivitamin), phosphatidylserine (PS) (200-400 mg daily), and sh- or algae-sourced omega-3s (1,000-2,000 mg daily). TAKE YOUR SUPPLEMENTS Even without major stresses in your life, it makes sense to take some basic nutritional supplements, for several reasons. One, if you get a nutrition workup, the results will provide clear guidance for the supplements you should take (see Step #1). Two, vitamin and mineral de ciencies are common, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. /T_h ree, the risk of de ciency increases sharply with age. Simply eating carefully isn't enough, in part because of ine ciencies in our metabolism required to break down and absorb nutrients. For people who don't get a nutrition workup, I always recommend starting a supplement regimen with a foundational supplement, speci cally a high-potency multivitamin. To this I recommend adding omega-3 sh oils, vitamin D, and a B-complex.ADD PROBIOTICS TO YOUR SUPPLEMENTS /T_h e omega-3s and vitamin D get most of the headlines these days, but I'm convinced that probiotic supplements will be the next \"big supplement. \" /T_h e reason relates to the growing research, which has shown that our gut bacteria\u2014the microbiome\u2014a ects so many aspects of our health. Strange as it might seem, we have 10 times the number of bacteria in our digestive tract as the number of cells in what we consider \"our\" body. /T_h ese good bacteria (and a few good yeasts as well) infl uence our risk of infection, allergies, weight gain, infl ammation, risk of rheumatoid arthritis, and colorectal cancer. /T_h e latest research has shown a clear connection between the health of our gut bacteria and our moods\u2014clear proof of the body-mind connection that mystics and alternative healers have talked about for years. Unfortunately, poor eating habits, constipation, diarrhea, stress, and antibiotics and many other drugs disrupt this remarkable bacterial community. /T_h at's where probiotics and prebiotics come in. Probiotics are supplements of the good bacteria, and prebiotics are the foods these bacteria feed on. /T_h e most common families of probiotics are Lactobacillus and Bi dobacteria , which are typically abbreviated as L. and B., respectively. For fostering or maintaining a healthy population of gut bacteria, it helps to take a probiotic supplement containing at least some of these species\u2014 L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus, B. lactis, and B. longum . CLEAN UP YOUR PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS Y ou may read the ingredients on the foods you buy, but do you pay any attention to the ingredients in your body care products? Conventional personal care products like shampoos, lotions, deodorants, soaps, and cosmetics can contain a plethora of toxic ingredients, including probable carcinogens and endocrine disruptors. According to the Environmental Working Group, a consumer advocacy group, the average adult uses nine personal care products each day, with 126 unique chemical ingredients. /T_h is results in exposure to hundreds of chemicals each day from the very products that are meant to keep us clean and fresh.

For most of us, it's just no fun getting sweaty. Or we just don't have the time. So, how do we get more active? It's easier than you might imagine. Do note that I am trying to avoid the E (exercise) word. For many people, wearing skimpy clothes and working out in front of much more bu people in a sweaty gym is worse than Dante's Sixth Circle of Hell. But we humans are build for ambulation\u2014walking. And walking happens to be one of the easiest and most e ective of all physical activities. Start with moderation, especially if you're really out of shape. Walk just a block or two, being mindful that you'll have to cover the same distance on your way back. Bring someone to chat with\u2014a buddy is a great distraction. Every few days you should be able to walk a little farther and faster. And for your upper body, buy a couple of hand weights for strength training. GIVE YOURSELF SOME DOWNTIME TO RE-CENTER AND REGENERATE I'm a rm believer that we each need downtime\u2014time to ourselves\u2014to collect our thoughts and process the day's events. Some of us, particularly introverts, need more downtime than average. /T_h ese should be quiet times in which we can ponder the world without distractions (i.e., not checking texts or scrolling through Facebook).
