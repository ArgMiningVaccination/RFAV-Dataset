The Microlab NIMBUS is offered in multiple [platform](https://www.hamiltoncompany.com/automated-liquid-handling/platforms) configurations to provide the lab with a powerful and personalized solution. Personal Pipetting Workstation Watch the video below to learn more about the Microlab NIMBUS workstation. Features and Benefits Precision Pipetting The Microlab NIMBUS uses air displacement pipetting to achieve superior measurement accuracy. Additionally, Hamilton pipette channels and tips are designed to fit precisely together using a patented lock-and-key design called CO-RE (Compressed O-Ring Expansion). This creates a tight seal with precise tip alignment to eliminate tip distortion and ensure the highest accuracy during liquid handling steps. Optional anti-droplet control and liquid level detection technologies further safeguard sample and results integrity. Integrated Tools and Accessories With a flexible deck layout, the NIMBUS accommodates a broad range of tools and accessories to further enhance assay flexibility. - Labware Gripper - Clean Air Protection (CAP) System - Hamilton Heater Shaker (HHS) - Shift-N-Scan Tube Barcode Scanner - [MPE]2 Positive Pressure Module - Much more Software for Any Process The NIMBUS software allows users control their system for processes from simple to complex without compromising on requirements. NIMBUS software is completely integration friendly, easily allowing third party components to be added to the system without limiting functionality. Use the Method Editor to quickly create a method skeleton, with all possible actions in a toolbox for simple drag-and-drop programming. Options for Every Assay and Budget The Microlab NIMBUS provides users with multiple configurable base platforms to suit a variety of needs and budgets. - NIMBUS4: Features up to four independent pipetting channels for superior performance and flexible pipetting in tubes and plates - NIMBUS96: Features high-speed CO-RE 96 MP (Multi-Probe Head) for accurate, precise, and repeatable pipetting in 96- and 384-well plates in individual well, column row, and whole plate formats from 1-1000 \u00b5L - NIMBUS384: Features high-speed CO-RE 384 and repeatable pipetting in 96-, 384-, and 1536-well plates, in individual well, column, row, and whole plate formats from 0.5-50 \u00b5L - NIMBUS HD (High Density): Features up to 8 independent pipetting channels with independent movement in both Y and Z axes Convenience of Open or Enclosed Platforms The Microlab NIMBUS is available in open or enclosed platforms depending on needs and available space. Enclosed platform options include: - Standard Enclosed - Extended Enclosed - Large Extended Enclosed Buy Your Consumables Online The Microlab NIMBUS works with a wide variety of consumables to optimize efficiency and throughput in automated workflows.
