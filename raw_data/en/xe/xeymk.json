With over thousands of years of practice and development, TCM possesses a unique and integrated theory. It is a complete medicine system. More and more research of modern medicine proves that TCM has destinctive effects on most forms of illness. The fundamental principal of TCM is that the human body is considered as a whole system. The balance of the system is the foundation of the health, and thus the imbalance of it will result in illness. The purpose of TCM is to rebalance the system to return you to health. TCM treats both acute and chronic conditions, and is suitable for all age groups from young babies to the elderly and even pregnant women. Forms of Treatment in TCM - Acupuncture - Tuina (Chinese Massage Therapy) - Qi Gong - Herbs - Nutrition and lifestyle Acupuncture Acupuncture is the healing art of inserting fine, sterile needles into the body, and is based on the theory that your body's health depends on its Qi. Qi (chee) is the life force, or vital energy, that flows through the body via a network of meridians. These meridians run from head to toe connecting the body's organs and systems. if the Qi is strong, balanced and flowing freely, there is health. If the Qi is weak, blocked, or unbalanced, illness can occur. Using needles to stimulate specific points along the meridians allows the flow of Qi to be restored, thus enabling the body to heal itself. Acupuncture treats the body as a whole - mind, body and soul. Not only does it treat the presenting symptoms or illness, but the underlying root cause of the symptoms which came to be in the first place. The following are methods and techniques that can be used with acupuncture: Moxibustion Moxibustion is a traditional chinese medical technique that burns mugwort, a small spongy herb, to facilitate healing. This method is usually combined with acupuncture as it is more affective in treating certain conditions. The herb can be burned on top of the needles, above your skin, on salt or a slice of ginger. Cupping Cupping is a therapy that stimulates the flow of blood and qi to the superficial muscle layers. In this therapy small glass cups are placed over specific areas on your body. A vacuum is created in the cup using heat or suction. It is used to promote blood circulation and qi flow, for muscle tension, injury or pain, neck and shoulder pain, back pain, joint pain, fever, common cold, sciatica, bronchial congestion and much more. Electro-acupuncture Electro-acupuncture is a therapy which combines needling and electric stimulation by sending a small amount of electric current to the needle to treat diseases. Electro-acupuncture can be used to adjust body function, increase the analgesic and sedative effects, relieve muscular tension, promote blood circulation. FIM Energizer (Heat Lamp) Far-Infrared Mineral Energizer features a unique oversized black round plate clay-coated with a mineral formation of 33 essential elements. It is used with acupuncture for treating musculoskeletal disorders (such as muscle pain, strain, spasm, weakness, joint problems, stiffness of neck and shoulders, etc). Also treats other forms of illness. Auricular Therapy Ear acupuncture, also known as auricular therapy, is based on the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Auricular therapy is widely used for many conditions, including addiction treatment, mood disorders, obesity, pain, and other conditions. This medical system emphasises a holistic approach to medicine, an approach that treats the whole person. The acupuncture points found on the ear help to regulate the body's internal organs, structures, and functions. Ear acupuncture is generally incorporated into a regular acupuncture treatment. In addition to using acupuncture points on the rest of the body, a few ear acupuncture points are selected to help your particular condition. Ear acupuncture points may be stimulated for a longer period of time by using ear seeds or ear tacks. These seeds are held in place on the ear with a small piece of adhesive tape. Ear seeds may be left in the ear for a few days or up to two weeks. Ear tacks are very small needles with an adhesive backing. Ear tacks are inserted into the ear and left in the ear for a few days or up to one week. Tuina (Chinese Massage Therapy) Tuina is an oriental bodywork therapy that has been used in china for thousands of years. It uses the TCM theory of the flow of qi through the meridians as its basic therapeutic foundation. Tuina is a form of rich traditional chinese techniques that uses many different manipulations applying to acupoints, meridians and muscle groups for treating specific musculoskeletal disorders and chronic stress related disorders of the digestive, respiratory and reproductive systems, as well as many other conditions. Acupressure Acupressure is an ancient treatment technique based on the principles of acupuncture, and involves the use of finger pressure, without needles, on specific acupuncture points along the body. The use of acupressure has been found to usually be beneficial in relieving pain, stress, and as well as to help with morning sickness. It is incorporated with acupuncture and tuina massage along the meridians for headache, neck and shoulder pain, back pain and many other conditions. Qi Gong Qi Gong (pronounced \"chee gong\"), \"Qi\" means air, breath of life, or vital energy of the body, and \"Gong\" means the skill of working with, cultivating, self dicipline and achievement. The art of Qigong consists primarily of meditation, relaxation, physical movement, mind-body integration, and breathing exercises.

It is believed that regular practice of Qigong helps to cleanse the body of toxins, restore energy, reduce stress and anxiety, integrate mind/ body/ spirit, prevent illness and help individuals maintain a healthy and active lifestyle.
