Our year of celebration quickly turned into one full of upheaval and discourse. The pandemic forced our School and our work onto center stage where we have been essential in responding to the pandemic. As I reflected upon our past, our accomplishments and our future, I realized that we have been preparing for times like these for the past 50 years. During the first decade, two visionary and passionate men \u2014 J. Thomas Grayston and Robert Day \u2014 led the School. Under their direction, the School established a reputation as a research powerhouse with a culture of collaboration along with community outreach and impact. These values remain today and have played a vital role in how we approach our work. Our School's unique commitment to research and practice helps train students who appreciate the interconnectedness of both. Our faculty, staff, students and alumni have tackled some of the most pressing population health issues of our time. In this issue, we recognize 50 Changemakers of Public Health, but there are many more who deserve acknowledgment. During this pandemic, many members of our School worked endless hours in challenging environments, giving 200% effort during a difficult year. This pandemic shined a glaring light on the inequities in many of our systems, including health care. Our School continues to make social justice, health equity and anti-racism our top priorities. Racism is an urgent public health threat, and we are committed to dismantling its systemic structure. Our students are the future, and we are excited about the prospects that the new Health Sciences Education Building offers them. The building, slated to open in 2022, allows all six health sciences schools to train students in how to work together, resulting in future professionals who are better prepared to improve the health of individuals and communities. We also recognize that we can make a bigger difference for communities when we have researchers and practitioners who look like the people we serve. This fact has energized our efforts to diversify our student body. To succeed, we will need to provide more financial support for students from diverse backgrounds, which is why we have launched our Campaign for Students. As I look forward to the next 50 years, I'm inspired and hopeful. The Hans Rosling Center for Population Health, our new home, is designed to encourage interactions with faculty, students, staff and partners from public health and many other disciplines to facilitate intentional collaborations. I have no doubt that during the decades ahead, our School will lead in developing great innovations and making amazing discoveries that will improve the health and well-being of all populations. I'm looking forward to working with all of you to make this future a reality.

Cover illustration by Alex Williamson. sph.uw.edu/magazine | 50th Anniversary Issue 1 WRITTEN BY ASHLIE CHANDLER AND JEFF HODSONUW School of Public Health marks half-century of impact J. Th omas Grayston discovered his passion for public health on a Midwestern corn fi eld. An old silo, to be precise. It was there, in the 1950s, that Grayston, a young medical doctor at the University of Chicago, investigated a case of histoplasmosis \u2014 a lung infection caused by fungal spores. At the time, little was known about the disease. Grayston had followed a patient back to his farm, 50 miles away in northwest Indiana. After inspecting the farm and taking soil samples, Grayston pieced it all together. Th e patient had become ill after cleaning out the old silo, disturbing soil containing infectious spores most likely from LAYING THE FOUNDATIONSFifty years of saving lives, serving the publicbird or bat droppings. Th e farmer's children, who helped shovel and transport the soil, were also aff ected. \"Clinicians treat patients in hospitals but by going out into the community, learning where they lived and worked, we were able to fi nd out how exactly the patient got infected,\" said Grayston, now 96. It was this experience that would launch Grayston into a career as an infectious disease epidemiologist, serving as one of the fi rst members ever of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Epidemic Intelligence Service. He then led studies of infectious diseases in East Asia for a U.S. naval research unit based in Taiwan before taking on a new challenge at the University of Washington in 1960. Th e School of Medicine, which formed just after World War II, had a small Department of Preventive Medicine, which Grayston was asked to chair. Grayston's timing was good. Funds were available from the federal government for public health and infectious disease research and training, the UW allowed him to recruit more faculty and the state had new revenue to fi nance environmental health research. In 1963, the Environmental Health Laboratory, which opened more than a decade earlier and was housed in the Department of Preventive Medicine, received funding from the state to expand the lab facilities and boost eff orts to improve occupational health for Washington's workers. By the end of the decade, the department had grown nearly tenfold, from four original faculty members. \"Th ose 10 years, from 1960 to 1970, are really very important to the current school of public health,\" Grayston said. \"Th ey really laid the foundation.\" Grayston's early focus was on boosting research productivity and hiring key faculty who would become important leaders: Russ Alexander, Ed Perrin, George Kenny and Hjordis Foy, to name a few. By 1968, the department was essentially set up as a school of public health. It had divisions that would soon become their own departments: biostatistics, epidemiology, pathobiology and environmental health (which began in 1947 as a small program in sanitary science). A health care studies program launched that year. \"As the department grew, it really didn't fi t in with the School of Medicine,\" Grayston said. Its sheer size and specialties made it unique. Additionally, the Pacifi c Northwest needed a public health training and research center. \"Th e nearest public health schools were in Berkeley and Minneapolis,\" Grayston said. Another motivating factor: federal funds for training were available specifi cally for schools of public health, of which the U.S. had only 11 at the time. On May 22, 1970, the UW Board of Regents approved plans for an autonomous School of Public Health and Community Medicine, with Grayston as its fi rst dean. A report on that meeting noted that the \"emphasis on the health of population groups is ordinarily diff erent from the emphasis on individual patient care characteristics of other departments of the School of Medicine.\" Research was to focus on the causes of disease and preventive measures. Th e School was charged with mobilizing support for health-related legislation as well as reducing the cost and increasing the quality and availability of health services. Th e new School would continue to train medical students and provide PhD and master's degrees for practitioners, teachers and investigators. It would also off er short courses for regional public health personnel. Th e School formally opened on July 1, 1970. It already had a new home \u2014 the Health Sciences' F-Wing \u2014 completed in 1966 with state and federal funding. Called the Preventive Medicine and Environmental Research Wing, it seemed like a lot of space at the time. Th e UW School of Public Health and Community Medicine quickly became known as a strong research center, especially on respiratory infections and sexually transmitted diseases. \"Our biostatistics group was seen as one of the better programs in the country,\" Grayston said. \"Same could be said for epidemiology.\" One major accomplishment included Grayston's work with Palmer Beasley, James Gale and Roger Dietels in Taiwan, where the team successfully tested a vaccine for rubella. While he laid the foundations for the School and its core disciplines, Grayston was dean for only one year. In 1971, John Hogness, former dean of medicine and then UW executive vice president, recruited Grayston to become vice president of health sciences, overseeing the six health sciences schools. Grayston maintained his research labs while an administrator and would return to his research until retiring in 2010. Th e man Grayston recruited to lead the new Department of Health Services, Robert \"Bob\" Day, would guide the School through its fi rst decade, setting the tone for new collaborations and community outreach. J. Thomas Grayston 2 UW Public Health Magazine sph.uw.edu/magazine | 50th Anniversary Issue 3 The School's student body grew along with its thriving degree programs, such as the Master of Health Administration (MHA) program, headed for a time by William Richardson, then chair of the Department of Health Services, and Stephen Shortell, who was named Health Services chair in 1980. An Executive MHA Program was added in 1997 for working health care professionals. Also designed for working professionals was the Extended MPH Program (now called the Online MPH Program - SEE STORY ON PAGE 50 ) that offi cially launched in 1980 to help practitioners advance their skills and knowledge in public health while based in communities across the country and internationally. Th e School gained PhD programs in epidemiology (originally a PhD in preventive medicine) and biostatistics, as well as master's programs in epidemiology and health systems and policy. A new Northwest Center for Occupational Health and Safety, founded in 1977 and based in the Department of Environmental Health, provided fi nancial support to graduate students in occupational health and safety and continuing education for practitioners in the fi eld. Under the leadership of Russ Alexander, the Department of Epidemiology expanded its expertise beyond infectious diseases to include genetic, injury, cardiovascular disease and cancer epidemiology. Donovan Th ompson, chair of the Department of Biostatistics from 1973 to 1983, was integral to a fl ourishing collaboration between the School and the new Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Th is partnership, championed by Bob Day, who would later become president of Fred Hutch, not only created synergy between the School's epidemiologists and biostatisticians that led to important contributions in cancer research, but 1970sAgainst a backdrop of the war in Vietnam, continued ght for women's and racial equality and crusade to protect the environment, the UW School of Public Health and Community Medicine formalized its training of medical students along with a new generation of graduate students seeking to improve the health of human populations.DEAN: Robert Day (1972-1982)* UW School of Public Health and Community Medicine, January 1970.

Major scientifi c accomplishments included Palmer Beasley's discovery that chronic infection with hepatitis B was a cause of liver cancer, a fi nding that led to interventions that have saved countless lives, and Noel Weiss' studies linking the use of hormone therapy to ease symptoms of menopause to an increased risk of cancer of the lining of the uterus. Th e School's commitment to health equity began to take form during this decade. To improve access to quality health care in the U.S., particularly in rural communities, the MEDEX Northwest program, founded in 1969 by Richard Smith and housed in the Department of Health Services from 1972 to 1994, trained former military medics and corpsmen to be civilian health practitioners \u2014 laying the groundwork for the physician assistant profession. When Smith left the UW to expand this training globally in 1973, David Lawrence, a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) Clinical Scholar, took over and expanded the program to include nurses and others. By the 1980s, graduates could earn degrees in clinical health services. Additionally, in 1975, Paula Diehr led an infl uential evaluation of the Prepaid Health Care Project of Seattle's Model Cities Program, intended to subsidize health care for the city's low-income families. Bill Richardson, Doug Conrad and others in the Department of Health Services also took part. Th e RWJF Clinical Scholars Program, awarded to the School in the mid-1970s, helped to boost the School's training of young physicians as leaders and health services researchers, giving them the tools they needed to tackle complex health problems in communities. Th is program spawned some notable alumni and changemakers (SEE STORY ON PAGE 38 ) over the next few decades, such as pioneering gun violence researchers Frederick Rivara and Art Kellerman. Dr. Richard A. Smith, founder of MEDEX Northwest with (clockwise) Dr. Ray Vath, and Deputy Director and Deputy Administrator of MEDEX Gerry Bassett and Mark Markarian. Under the leadership of Gilbert \"Gil\" Omenn, originally recruited to be chair of the Department of Environmental Health, the School solidi ed its excellence in the basic sciences of public health and expanded to other elds such as health promotion and prevention, health policy and practice. Researchers continued to serve the state through their environmental health work and strengthened their collaborations with communities, health departments and other UW units.DEAN: Gilbert \"Gil\" Omenn (1982-1997) 1980s Appointed as chair of the Department of Biostatistics in 1983, Norman Breslow, a world-renowned biostatistician, provided leadership that would guide the biostatistics department down a path to becoming the No. 1 biostatistics program in the world. He helped to build the modern fi eld of biostatistics, Photos courtesy of: MEDEX Northwest 4 UW Public Health Magazine sph.uw.edu/magazine | 50th Anniversary Issue 5 nurturing the careers of young researchers and advancing science to improve public health. Breslow would lead the department for a decade. Th e School expanded its training of students in the development and application of methods in epidemiologic research. Noel Weiss, who became chair of the Department of Epidemiology in 1984, and T om Koepsell, who was handed the baton in 1994, established the School's renowned two-course series on epidemiologic methods and co-taught it through 2011. Th e School also continued to broaden its epidemiological expertise by bringing back School alumni such as Bruce Psaty and David Siscovick, who co-founded the Cardiovascular Health Research Unit, and by partnering with Seattle- based institutions like UW Medicine and Swedish Medical Center to recruit clinical epidemiologists who could serve as mentors to students. Th e Center of Excellence in Maternal and Child Health, founded by Irv Emanuel, admitted its fi rst class of students in 1985. Th e program, now led by Daniel Enquobahrie, provides graduate-level training in maternal and child health research and practice and shares knowledge with the public health workforce through the Northwest Bulletin. Th e program, which was the fi rst in the School to include a practicum as part of its training, has graduated more than 300 students. Fred Connell, Colleen Huebner and Melissa Schi have also served as directors. In 1986, the School was selected to house one of the fi rst three Prevention Research Centers in the country, funded by the CDC. Th e School's Health Promotion Research Center laid the groundwork for increased engagement with communities and a growing emphasis on public health practice. Recognizing the changing demographics at the time, the center \u2014 based in the health services department \u2014 was designed to focus on the health promotion of older adults. Later, in the 1990s, the center would develop a depression treatment program for older adults called the Program to Encourage Active, Rewarding Lives, dubbed PEARLS, in collaboration with communities. Refl ecting the growing environmental justice movement, the School's Department of Environmental Health, then led by Sheldon Murphy, recruited young faculty with excellent research potential and established the UW Superfund Research Program, with funding from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, to address human health and environmental issues related to hazardous substances. Th e program continues to partner with local, state, tribal and federal entities and impacted communities to understand and break the link between chemical exposure and disease. Additionally, the environmental health department \u2014 together with the UW's Department of Medicine and the Division of General Internal Medicine \u2014 established the Occupational and Environmental Medicine Clinic at Harborview Medical Center. Th e clinic continues to work with patients, labor unions, employers and community groups to prevent, diagnose and treat injuries and diseases caused or aggravated by work or community environmental exposures. A small international health program began to form during this period, as Stephen Gloyd and others secured funding to lead projects with students in Mozambique and other parts of the African continent. To promote policies and programs that strengthen primary health care in Mozambique, Gloyd and a group of doctors and nurses created the Mozambique Health Committee in 1987. Over the next 30 years, the Noel Weiss, Kathie Koepsell and Tom Koepsell preparing to go white water rafting, 1984. MAJOR SCIENTIFIC ACCOMPLISHMENTS Laura Koutsky , a PhD student who would later become a faculty member, conducted studies that demonstrated the link between human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical cancer. This research spurred the development of new cervical cancer screening methods and was critical to the fi rst HPV vaccine trials. Koutsky served as the lead investigator in one of these trials. Smallpox was eradicated due largely to the work of then-A liate Professor William Foege of the Department of Epidemiology and his novel surveillance and containment approach to vaccination. Marilyn Bergner and Betty Gilson developed the Sickness Impact Profi le, a novel tool for measuring health status behaviorally that attracts widespread use.committee expanded its reach and mandate \u2014 becoming Health Alliance International \u2014 to implement health systems strengthening programs and research across four continents, and to provide a model for global health advocacy and intervention rooted in solidarity with public sector health systems . In response to the AIDS epidemic in the U.S., the UW/Fred Hutch Center for AIDS Research was launched under the leadership of King Holmes, becoming one of the fi rst and largest centers of its kind in the country. Th e center has since contributed to improving the continuum of care for individuals with HIV around the world. Locally, a strong partnership with the public health department helped Seattle and King County become the nation's fi rst major metropolitan region to achieve the World Health Organization's 90-90-90 goal. In 1988, Joan Kreiss established the International AIDS Research and Teaching Program at the UW, with funding from the Fogarty International Center, to foster international collaborative AIDS research through scientist exchange. Th e program has since trained more than 330 investigators in Africa, Asia and Latin America, and many former students have continued collaborative research relationships with UW colleagues after they returned to their home countries. Th e program is now led by Carey Farquhar. To mark the 25th anniversary of the School in 1995, the Department of Biostatistics, led at the time by Th omas Fleming, hosted the fi rst Seattle Symposium in Biostatistics, attended by more than 400 statisticians from over a dozen countries. In the Department of Health Services, researchers partnered with Group Health Research Institute to conduct the \"Kaiser Evaluation\" of interventions to promote community health. Susan Hedrick and others developed a way to evaluate the eff ectiveness of adult day health care programs for veterans. Donald Patrick, who was hired in 1987 to launch the Social and Behavioral Sciences program, co-authored a world-famous report on health status and quality of life. Paula Diehr, who served as interim chair of the department in 1994, and Fred Connell, a long-time associate dean of academic aff airs, won AcademyHealth's Publication-of-the-Year Award for their paper on the null hypothesis in a small- area analysis. An era of continued maturity for the School, this decade saw many key accomplishments that helped to establish the institution as a national leader in public health research, training and practice. The School embraced pivotal philanthropic partnerships and later in the decade gained Patricia \"Pat\" Wahl as the rst woman to serve as dean.1990s DEAN: Gilbert \"Gil\" Omenn (1982-1997) 1981 Marvin Oliver, who passed away in 2019, designed the Soul Catcher as a logo for the School.

David Eaton founded the Center for Ecogenetics and Environmental Health (now called the Center for Exposures, Diseases, Genomics and Environment, or EDGE). Elaine Faustman created the Institute for Risk Analysis and Risk Communication. Mark Oberle founded the Northwest Center for Public Health Practice to help improve public health through collaboration between academia and the practice fi eld. Richard Fenske and Matthew Keifer established the Pacifi c Northwest Agricultural Safety and Health Center to address health and safety concerns in the farming, fi shing and forestry workforces. Th e Department of Environmental Health graduated its fi rst PhD students in 1995 and an innovative graduate training program in public health genetics was established in 1999. Led by Melissa Austin, a faculty member in the epidemiology department, the public health genetics program focused on using genomic advances to improve population health. Th e Institute for Public Health Genetics, as it is known now, remains the only one if its kind in the world, off ering a PhD, MPH and graduate certifi cate in public health genetics as well as an MS in genetic epidemiology. Bruce Weir currently serves as director. Early in the decade, the Interdisciplinary Graduate Program in Nutritional Sciences, which included a PhD program in nutritional sciences, moved into the School, with an administrative home in the Department of Epidemiology. (Th e Nutritional Sciences Program, as it is now known, would later move into the Offi ce of the Dean). Elaine Monsen served as director of the program from 1994 to 1998, at which point Adam Drewnowski took the helm. An MPH in nutrition was created in 1996. In 1993, Michelle Williams, then a professor of epidemiology, created the Minority International Research T raining Program, which trained students from underrepresented backgrounds for research and leadership careers in public health. Th e program trained hundreds of students in global health, biostatistics and epidemiology in over 14 international research sites in South America, Southeast Asia, Africa and Europe. Williams is now dean of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. In 1995, the Department of Environmental Health was authorized by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to off er health and safety training and continuing education courses through the Pacifi c Northwest OSHA Education Center, serving Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Alaska. Th e Health Policy Analysis Program, a service team that worked with state policy makers on issues of public health importance, made some signifi cant headway. Led by Aaron Katz from 1988 to 2003, the program staff ed a state commission for two years to come up with a health care reform proposal, which was passed by the state legislature in 1993. Th ough the bill was repealed two years later, parts of the reforms were kept in place. Boosted by faculty who held prominent positions in local health districts, such as James Gale, former Wenatchee health offi cer, the School continued to build ties with practice partners in the state and strengthened its status as a practice-oriented school of public health. Making philanthropy a priority, Omenn cultivated strategic relationships with private organizations that led to endowments that have continued to support the recruitment of promising researchers and educators as professors and chairs ( SEE PAGE 52 to learn about Omenn's philanthropic legacy).\"THE PUBLIC HEALTH GENETICS PROGRAM WAS ONE OF THE SIGNAL INITIATIVES OF THIS TIME. IT WAS A SPLENDID EXAMPLE OF ENGAGING ALL THE OTHER UW HEALTH SCIENCES SCHOOLS, THE LAW SCHOOL, PUBLIC POLICY, ANTHROPOLOGY AND OTHER PARTS OF THE CAMPUS.\" Gil Omenn, who played a key role in the development of the program, said in a 2013 video interview Former directors of the Northwest Center for Public Health Practice pose with Health Resources and Services Administration Representative John Kress. The first Seattle Symposium in Biostatistics. L to R: Paul Meier, Sir David Cox (keynote speaker at the first symposium), Mitch Gail, Tom Fleming and Ross Prentice. Together with the UW School of Medicine, the School launched a new Department of Global Health in 2007 with a generous investment from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and initial funding from Washington state, and named King Holmes the founding chair. Th e School's former Department of Pathobiology became a PhD program within the new department and an MPH program was launched in 2008. Four centers formed the new global health department: Th e Center for AIDS Research, Health Alliance International, Global Health Resource Center and International T raining & Education Center for Health (I-TECH). I-TECH was established by Ann Downer in 2002 to develop a skilled health workforce and strengthen health systems globally. Since its inception, I-TECH has supported programs in more than 30 countries, launched several local health organizations to ensure country ownership and transitioned more than 350 programs to local entities. Pamela Collins became I-TECH's executive director following Downer's retirement in 2020. In 2008, the global health department's International Clinical Research Center (ICRC) was established to coordinate and implement multi- center international infectious disease prevention trials. ICRC has since spearheaded pivotal HIV prevention research, including the Partners PrEP Study, led by Jared Baeten and others, which contributed to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval in 2012 of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention. Today, the ICRC is home to several studies on the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Bruce Weir, who was recruited to lead the Department of Biostatistics in 2006, brought the Summer Institute in Statistical Genetics to the UW School of Public health. Th e institute would eventually expand to include Statistics in Modeling and Infectious Diseases, Statistics in Clinical & Epidemiological Research and Statistics in Big Data. Weir still serves as the institute's director. He was also integral in the creation of the Genetic Analysis Center in 2007 to advance the discovery of genetic variation and how it contributes to human disease and well-being. Th e center, which Weir now directs, is the coordinating center for the T rans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. Under Chair David Kalman, the Department of Environmental Health changed its name to the Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences to refl ect its growing expertise Under Pat Wahl, a professor of biostatistics and an early graduate of the School, the School changed its name to the School of Public Health. It took critical steps to expand its impact on global health and nutritional sciences and began to build a pathway for undergraduates to study public health.2000s DEAN: Patricia \"Pat\" Wahl (1999-2010) Montlenyane Madisa (left) and Erin Seiler, both from I-TECH, hold up a facilitator's guide for an I-TECH-supported course on the Management of Sexually Transmitted Infections in Botswana, 2006.* Founding chairs of the Department of Global Health.

In 2005, the Environmental Protection Agency awarded its largest- ever research grant to the department to study the connection between air pollution and cardiovascular disease. Th is period was also defi ned by key achievements made to build up a thriving program in nutritional sciences and dietetics, led by Adam Drewnowski. Early in the decade, the Center for Public Health Nutrition was created and an MS in nutritional sciences was launched. In 2008, two successful and accredited programs \u2014 the Didactic Program in Dietetics and the Dietetic Internship \u2014 were combined to create the Graduate Coordinated Program in Dietetics, led by Director Anne Lund. Th e School also developed more undergraduate courses in nutrition. Th e School launched a new PhD program in health services in 2000, along with an occupational health services research training track, jointly sponsored by the Departments of Health Services and Environmental Health. A bachelor's program in Health Informatics & Health Information Management (HIHIM) began in 2001, and a master's degree option in HIHIM would be added in 2012. Th e School also launched an innovative MPH program in 2002, called Community- Oriented Public Health Practice (COPHP) program, which uses a problem-based learning approach to train students eager to develop practice skills. Fred Connell was the program's founding director. Bud Nicola, who helped design the program, took over later in the decade and Peter House would guide the program into the next decade. Amy Hagopian served as the program's director from 2013 to 2021. Pat Wahl established a public health practice pathway for faculty promotion and created the fi rst associate dean position for public health practice, held by Mark Oberle, a model followed by many other schools since. Together with Oberle, Wahl visited 33 local health departments to improve relations with the School's practice partners. Howard \"Howie\" Frumkin worked to create a sense of the School as a whole rather than the sum of its parts and set the School on a path toward addressing important and emerging public health challenges, from climate change to obesity. When Frumkin departed in 2016, Joel Kaufman, a long-time faculty member, was selected to serve as interim dean and was integral to reshaping the School's popular MPH program and to jump-starting its e orts around equity, diversity and inclusion. Hilary Godwin was recruited to become dean in 2018.2010s DEANS: Howard \"Howie\" Frumkin (2010-2016), Joel annual to the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Richland, Wash. Pictured: 2019 COPHP graduates and faculty members Aaron Katz, Gerry Pollet and Amy Hagopian.Building off the School's 2012- 2020 strategic plan, spearheaded by Howie Frumkin, the Center for Health and the Global Environment (CHanGE) was formed in 2014 and Kristie Ebi was hired as its fi rst director. Th e center, which is shared between the Departments of Global Health and Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences, brings together an interdisciplinary team of researchers and practitioners to partner with communities to develop tools, test interventions, implement solutions and train the next generation to promote and protect health in a changing climate. Jeremy Hess took over as director in 2019. Other strategic hires during this period included Alison Fohner, a genetic epidemiologist and a 2015 graduate of the School's PhD program in public health genetics; Anjum Hajat, who studies social and environmental stressors and how they impact health; Jessica Jones-Smith, who studies the social, environmental and economic causes and correlates of obesity risk; and Bryan Weiner, who would lead the Department of Global Health's new Implementation Science Program. Th e Department of Global Health continued to fl ourish on many fronts. A PhD program in Global Health Metrics and Implementation Science was created and the Global Health E-Learning Initiative began to off er online courses and educational resources to support students, faculty and health workers worldwide. Since 2012, these courses have enrolled more than 50,000 students from 59 countries. Th e department also gained the Global Center for Integrated Health of Women, Adolescents and Children (Global WACh) \u2014 now directed by Grace John-Stewart \u2014 that takes a life-cycle approach to scientifi c innovation and leadership. Additionally, the Program on Global Mental Health began with the goal of expanding access to eff ective mental health interventions. Th e program is led by Pamela Collins and is a joint eff ort between the Departments of Global Health and of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. In 2014, Judith Wasserheit became chair of the department and the fi rst woman chair in the School. Th e UW's 25-year Population Health Initiative kicked off in 2016, bringing together disciplines across the University to work on solutions to local and global population health issues. To bring key partners in the initiative under one roof, the UW broke ground on the new Hans Rosling Center for Population Health, which offi cially opened in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Th e building was funded in large part by a transformative gift from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and now serves as the School's new home (SEE PAGE 58 to learn more about the building). In 2018, the Seattle City Council unanimously passed regulation requiring gun owners to safely store their fi rearms and to report stolen guns, a policy signifi cantly informed by the School's researchers, including Ali Rowhani- Rahbar and Frederick Rivara. Earlier that same year, a study led by then-PhD student Erin Morgan showed that only 37% of Washington state's gun owners safely store their fi rearms. Later, in 2020, the UW received $1.5 million from the CDC to study handgun carrying among rural adolescents. Th at study is led by Rowhani-Rahbar, who was named the UW's Bartley Dobb Professor for the Study and Prevention of Violence during this period and also co-directs the Firearm Injury & Policy The Hans Rosling Center for Population Health.OTHER CENTERS THAT FORMED 2013 : The Center for One Health Research was created to investigate the links between people, animals and the environment we share. 2013 : The Seattle-Denver Center for Innovation was established to conduct health services research that advances veteran-centered and value-driven health care. The center is a partnership between the Health Services Research & Development programs at Veterans Aff airs (VA) Puget Sound in Seattle and VA Eastern Colorado in Denver. 2017 : The Center for Health Innovation and Policy Science was founded to improve health across communities and the lifespan through innovation, evaluation and training in health policy and health systems science. 10 UW Public Health Magazine sph.uw.edu/magazine | 50th Anniversary Issue 11 Research Program at Harborview Injury Prevention & Research Center. Th e Strategic Analysis, Research & T raining (START) Program was established in 2011 under the direction of Judd Walson and Lisa Manhart. Th e program was a collaboration between the School's Department of Global Health and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to provide high- quality research support to help meet the Foundation's strategic information needs. In 2014, it expanded into the START Center and has continued to provide original research to global and domestic health teams. Janet Baseman, a School alum turned faculty member, founded the Student Epidemic Action Leaders (SEAL) Team in 2015 to provide students across the School with experience in applied epidemiology through methods training and fi eld assignments at state and local health departments. Since the program began, students have off ered more than 2,200 hours of support for assignments ranging from outbreak investigation to emergency response. In April 2020, members of the SEAL Team were called to participate in Washington state's surge response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Th e School adopted an anti-racism curriculum competency for students that was developed by Amy Hagopian, Kate West, Clarence Spigner and India Ornelas, who chaired a School-wide Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Committee during this time. In 2018, the School hired its fi rst-ever director of EDI, Victoria Gardner, who is now an assistant dean. Over the last few years, Gardner has led a tremendous eff ort to create an EDI road map for the School and to launch universal anti-racism training, among other initiatives ( SEE PAGE 54 for more on the School's EDI eff orts). A popular individualized studies degree in public health moved from the UW College of Arts & Sciences into the School of Public Health in 2012, and the curriculum was revised to create the Public Health Major. Sara Mackenzie was appointed to oversee the program and staff ers T ory Brundage and Susan Inman were hired to advise students and manage the major. In 2018, the major was renamed the Public Health- Global Health Major to better refl ect its domestic and global competencies. Th e program now off ers both a BA and BS, and it has grown to admit 300 students every academic year. More the 40% of students in the program have self-identifi ed as fi rst-generation college students. Barbara Baquero currently serves as the program's interim director. Jennifer Otten, one of the driving forces behind the School's Food Systems, Nutrition and Health major, took on an added role as Food Systems Director and the study of food systems became a new focus for the Nutritional Sciences Program. Under Joel Kaufman, the School embarked on an ambitious journey in 2018 to reshape its popular MPH program with a new common core curriculum that integrates research and practice skills while preparing students for an ever-changing public health landscape. Th e re-envisioned MPH program launched in the fall of 2020 and is led by Director India Ornelas and instructor teams for each of the six courses now required by all MPH degree students (except those in COPHP). Th e School welcomed its fi rst cohort for the Master of Science Capstone in Biostatistics, designed for students who wish to enter the job market upon graduation. In 2019, Lurdes Inoue became the fi rst woman to chair the Department of Biostatistics.MAJOR SCIENTIFIC ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2011: Former Biostatistics Chair Thomas Fleming published landmark research in the New England Journal of Medicine on the prevention of transmission of HIV. 2013: In a collaboration across departments in the School and with three other universities, Amy Hagopian and Abraham Flaxman conducted a household survey across 100 geographic clusters in Iraq to estimate mortality associated with the 2003 invasion. 2016: Joel Kaufman , who served as interim dean during this period, and his collaborators published a decade-long study that showed people in the U.S. living in areas with more air pollution accumulate deposits in the arteries that supply the heart faster than do people living in less polluted areas. 2019: An interactive mapping tool was created to rank Washington state communities most hurt by environmental health risks. State policymakers are now using the tool to inform the state's transition to 100% clean energy by 2045. Then-PhD student Esther Min, Edmund Seto and Michael Yost, who was named chair of the Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences in 2014, developed the tool alongside community partners. 2019: A study funded by the Washington State Legislature found that communities underneath and downwind of jets landing at Sea-Tac International Airport are exposed to a type of ultrafi ne air pollution distinctly associated with aircraft.CONTINUED GROWTH IN UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS 2013 : A minor in nutrition is off ered at the UW. 2012 : A suite of undergraduate courses is established in the Institute for Public Health Genetics. 2018 : A new undergraduate major in Food Systems, Nutrition and Health was launched. NUTR 302 Food Systems: Harvest to Health On Feb. 19, hundreds of people from across the UW's health sciences schools gathered in a lecture hall on the University's Seattle campus to discuss a newly named coronavirus disease, COVID-19, that was spreading around the world and had just been identifi ed in Washington state. In a sobering moment toward the end of the event, Scott Dowell from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation asked the audience who believed the virus would have such an impact in Seattle that the intensive care units (ICUs) would fi ll up with patients. Only a handful of attendees raised their hands. Just three weeks after that event, which was hosted by the UW's MetaCenter for Pandemic Disease Preparedness and Global Health Security (now the Alliance for Pandemic Preparedness), the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Within months, hospital ICUs in Seattle and in other cities around the world were fi lled with record numbers of critically ill patients.2020s DEAN: Hilary Godwin (2018-Present) 2020 was meant to be a year of celebration, as the UW School of Public Health was due to turn 50 on July 1. Instead, Hilary Godwin led faculty, sta and students through an unprecedented year of major, world-shift ing events, including a new movement against systemic racism, the burning of wildlands in the west, a tempestuous presidential election and the worst pandemic the world has seen in more than a century. Dean Godwin has continued to bring renewed commitment to operating the School in a manner that refl ects its public health values.

Learn more about their impact on education, research and policy:Ann Downer Emeritus Professor, Global Health When she looks back, Downer sees most of her career linked by values-focused work. A pioneering educator, she was founding executive director of I-TECH, the International Training and Education Center for Health, in the Department of Global Health, which runs programs in 30 technical areas supporting health care systems. She has worked at the edge of social justice issues, including reproductive rights and HIV prevention and treatment. I-TECH has become an international project that trains health workers in 16 countries using digital learning platforms. Aaron Katz Principal Lecturer Emeritus, Health Services Katz has been framing health in terms of policy for a 30-year career, most recently as a lecturer in the Department of Health Services. He calls this focus his 30,000-foot view of how structures promote or diminish health. From HIV to universal access, he's taught graduate students to see the diff erences that new policies can make. He also says working with policymakers is vitally important and academics have to continue to do that. King Holmes Distinguished Professor Emeritus, Global Health Holmes' career spanned the globe. A medical doctor and epidemiologist by training, Holmes was founding chair of the Department of Global Health, and honored for being \"father\" of sexually transmitted infection (STI) research, including leadership on HIV. Colleagues created an image of more than 150 scientists he had mentored in his more than 50 year career. He fought stigma and built bridges across disciplines to help millions of patients.Faculty Retirements sph.uw.edu/faculty-retirements-and-promotionsUnder the leadership of Hilary Godwin, the School became one of the fi rst in the country to move all its courses online on March 9 to help curb the spread of COVID-19. Th e UW made Zoom, a video conferencing tool, available to all current faculty, staff and students. Teaching faculty and assistants translated their coursework to better fi t the new, remote environment. Th ey also redesigned experiential- learning opportunities for students such as capstones and clinical rotations. Students worked with local public health agencies to track the disease while faculty and staff pivoted to conduct rapid research, several of which were awarded grants from the UW's Population Health Initiative. Th e School began a series of weekly webinars in March to share the latest updates on the School's and the UW's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Th e School has since hosted about three dozen webinars that have contributed to a greater sense of community as faculty, staff and students adapted to remote life. On May 25, George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis, Minnesota, after being handcuff ed and pinned to the ground by a police offi cer's knee, kicking off a series of protests against police violence. Countless people across the U.S. and around the world demonstrated and called for racial justice. In Seattle, faculty, staff and students joined thousands of doctors, nurses, health care workers and other public health experts to demand an end to systemic racism. More than 300 students, staff and faculty signed a petition calling for mandatory, recurring anti-racism training for all students and employees in the School. Dean Godwin tasked the School's EDI Committee and a dedicated workgroup with developing and implementing the universal anti- racism training, which began rolling out in the fall of 2020 ( SEE PAGE 54 to learn more).More than 700 students graduated in June in the School's fi rst-ever virtual graduation celebration and a new, fi ve-year strategic plan launched in July. Th e 2020-2025 plan centers on a commitment to making public health impact and has equity, justice and anti- racism as a through line. Jared Baeten, who served as vice dean of strategy, faculty aff airs and new initiatives from 2019-2020, was vital to the development of the strategic plan. He also led the development of the School's new faculty compensation plan ( SEE PAGE 63 to learn more about Baeten's next chapter). Thousands of doctors, nurses, health care workers and public health experts march in downtown Seattle on June 6 to demand an end to systemic racism.

She helped researchers prove the relationship between certain HPV infections and ano- genital cancers, leading to further research that helped develop a successful vaccine. McKnight also developed curriculum in her department and says listening to the questions of students helped her center her teaching around those areas. She also worked closely on studies of cardiovascular disease. Mike Rosenfeld Professor Emeritus, Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences Rosenfeld took his knowledge of the vascular system in humans and studied and taught both nutritional sciences and environmental infl uences on heart health in his 30-year career. Rosenfeld helped develop mice that were genetically altered to show signs of atherosclerosis, and with that model also tested the impact of diesel exhaust on the rodents. This research helped the public understand that air pollution contributes to heart disease. Noah Seixas Professor Emeritus, Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences Seixas spent his 43-year public health career focused on vulnerable workers. With his doctorate in industrial hygiene, he developed new ways to measure worker exposure to coal dust \u2014 work that led to policy changes to protect those workers. He also pioneered ways to protect gig workers and people likely to suff er race or gender discrimination on the job. Seixus reminds us that socioeconomic factors have a profound impact on health.Kathleen Peterson Senior Lecturer Emeritus, Health Services From her fi rst job compiling patient records for a hospital to her recent work developing curriculum for the Health Informatics and Health Information Management program, Peterson has been chasing emerging technology for her entire career. Her leadership helped grow enrollment in the program, at both the bachelor's and master's levels. She says seeing the success of the graduates is one of the best parts of teaching. Ann Vander Stoep Retired as Professor, Epidemiology, and Adjunct Professor, Global Health Vander Stoep made children, and their mental health, the center of her work for many years as an epidemiological psychiatrist. She combined knowledge on depression with study of the public social fabric. She led an innovative long-term study of mental health among public school students in Seattle middle schools, and shared her methods with a project in Kenya. Vander Stoep also played an important role in launching the UW Global Mental Health Program. Noel Weiss Professor Emeritus, Epidemiology Weiss, mentor to a generation of budding epidemiologists, enjoyed teaching the methods that he calls the \"gospel\" for designing observations and analysis to best prove links between exposure and illness. Although he was an author on about 700 papers, Weiss remembers the mentoring most fondly. Weiss says he loved knowing that others took what they learned from him and applied it to big questions.Jon Wellner Retired as Professor, Biostatistics During his 37 years at the UW, Wellner was a professor in both biostatistics and statistics. He co-authored a book about empirical processes, now a standard text in many programs. His work is at the interface of probability and statistics, and his mentoring of students is central to his legacy. He cites more than 100 academic \"children and grandchildren.\" MaryLou Thompson Research Professor Emeritus, Biostatistics Thompson saw enormous scale change in the data that her fi eld of biostatistics could tackle, from working with a thousand paper records to computerized searching of millions of electronic documents. During her time at the UW, she worked in South Africa (where she did her graduate work) and off ered training for health workers there. She served on a task force for the School of Public Health in equity, diversity and inclusion and will continue striving for improvement after retirement. 16 UW Public Health Magazine sph.uw.edu/magazine | 50th Anniversary Issue 17 As Washington became the first state in the nation to identify an outbreak of the novel coronavirus, faculty in the UW School of Public Health quickly grasped that life was about to change. \"We were ramping up, knowing that we were going to need to shift to online teaching at the end of winter quarter 2020,\" said Sara Mackenzie, director of the Public Health-Global Health Major at that time. And then, within two days, the University of Washington became one of the fi rst in the country to make the switch to remote instruction. Few of the core Public Health-Global Health faculty members had online teaching experience, and most had never set up a Zoom meeting. Th ey had a lot to learn, Mackenzie said, but also a lot of support from the School and University. \"I'm just blown away by the faculty, staff and students, and how they've risen to the occasion,\" said Mackenzie, who is currently on leave to assist with COVID-19 response at the U.S. Department of Labor Job Corps. Th e transition was not without hiccups, from dropped connections to security lapses. But it also sparked creative adaptations and eff orts to strengthen teaching that faculty and students say will continue to infl uence higher education long after in-person classes resume. BUILDING A VIRTUAL COMMUNITY How do you build community when you can't meet face to face? Th at was a key challenge confronting faculty as they planned for this new way of teaching. One answer for Public Health-Global Health was to require students to log on to classes at their scheduled times. Adapting to remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic WRITTEN BY ALLEGRA ABRAMO \"Th e evidence suggests that, in times of uncertainty, having opportunities to come together and connect can really be meaningful and important,\" Mackenzie said. Th at meant faculty couldn't just lecture, she said. Th ey had to be intentional about fi nding ways for students to contribute to the conversation. Instructors, for example, had students drop ideas into the chat box and asked them to quickly answer questions via online polls, providing immediate feedback on how well they grasped a concept. Small-group discussions took place in virtual breakout rooms, with one important diff erence from the classroom \u2014 instructors couldn't walk around the room to check in and answer questions. As a result, faculty learned they must provide clear, written guidance students can refer to during breakout conversations. Some of those tools enhanced participation, said Stephanie Farquhar, the School's acting associate dean for education from January 2020 to June 2020. \"Th ere's something about sph.uw.edu/magazine | 50th Anniversary Issue 19 18 UW Public Health Magazinehaving the safety of that physical barrier of being online,\" said Farquhar, who is also a clinical professor of health services and environmental and occupational health services. \"I feel like more students were asking questions and participating.\" Online teaching also required instructors to focus on the most essential material. Th ey simply could not cover as much in an online setting, though it's unclear why that's the case. It might take longer to \"be really clear and share information in this format,\" Farquhar said, and for students to get settled into breakout rooms or to switch between Zoom screens. \"If you have to get rid of two-thirds of content that you already thought was critical,\" Mackenzie said, \"you really have to step back and think, 'What is it I'm trying to do? And how do I do it in a way that students are actively engaged?'\" For Sarah Sutton, who was a second-year MPH student in health services and a teaching assistant for Public Health-Global Health, online teaching was \"exciting and challenging.\" It was also nerve-wracking, she said, because you're learning as you go. \"To be honest, having technical issues at the beginning of class was enough to throw me off for the rest of class,\" Sutton said. Many instructors expressed similar frustrations, said Farquhar. Th ey supported each other through weekly meetings and observed each other's classes to learn how Zoom's features were being used. Challenges remained, but some former skeptics were converts to online instruction. \"I never thought I would say this,\" Mackenzie said, \"but I'm actually loving the online environment.\" TRANSITIONS TO ONLINE LEARNING Not all students were as enthusiastic. It was \"more of a bummer on the student side,\" Sutton said of her experience as a graduate student in her fi nal quarter. \"It's sad not to see your friends and peers.\" Th at echoes what Farquhar heard when she polled her students, all graduating seniors. Many seemed disappointed to miss out on the in-person experience. For Paloma Silva, who was a senior Public Health-Global Health major, the experience was mixed. She liked being able to show up for her 8:30 a.m. class in pajamas but also found it harder to stay focused. While more comfortable answering \"It takes these big disruptions to force us to change.\" Tess Harpur, graduate teaching assistant (May 2020) with her dog Hobbes.professors' questions in the chat box than speaking up in class, Silva found breakout discussions could be \"awkward\" because students didn't know each other. Although Silva preferred in-class lectures, she appreciated her professors' eff orts to retool their classes for online learning. \"Th eir quick adjustments and constant request for class feedback told me that they really cared and strived to make the online learning environment as enriching as possible,\" said Silva. Early on, Silva missed a week of class because she didn't have an internet connection. Relying on her cell phone as a wi-fi hot spot made it unaff ordable. Silva was able to get an emergency grant from the School to help with the bill until she could get internet service set up at home. Other students who needed a computer have been able to borrow one from the University. Despite the challenges, students made a \"phenomenal eff ort\" to be present, Mackenzie said. Students live across the country and the world, in time zones up to 15 hours away. Yet most managed to log in at class time, and instructors accommodated those who could not. At the same time, security was a challenge. Th ere were several instances of Zoom-bombing, where an unauthorized person gains access to a class and shows vulgar or inappropriate images. In one case, said Farquhar, a student was threatened. Such incidents decreased as the University and Zoom took steps to improve security, she said. But there's one kind of Zoom-bombing that should be encouraged, according to Sutton: Let students bring their pets on camera. \"Th at's a way to bring a little humor into it,\" she said, \"and also acknowledge the situation that people are in right now.\" DISRUPTIONS SPUR CHANGE, SUCCESS As both students and instructors realize they can be successful in an online environment, online course off erings are likely to expand. \"It's making me consider things that I never thought about before,\" Mackenzie said. While it's harder to do active, cohort-based learning online, she's realizing that it's not impossible. Perhaps, she mused, one of the three Public Health-Global Health cohorts could be off ered online in the future. Even service learning can be done remotely, the program discovered. After initially planning to scrap the community service requirement, faculty worked with partners to develop projects that more than 100 students could do remotely. \"Sometimes,\" Mackenzie said, \"it takes these big disruptions to force us to change.\" Clockwise from top left to right: Tess Harpur, Suzinne Pak-Gorstein, William Tsang and Sara Mackenzie during an instructor Zoom meeting in May 2020. 20 UW Public Health Magazine sph.uw.edu/magazine | 50th Anniversary Issue 21 WRITTEN BY ALLEGRA ABRAMO AND ASHLIE CHANDLER ILLUSTRATIONS BY TED BOYER A s COVID-19 began spreading across Washington communities, Janet Baseman, associate dean for public health practice at the UW School of Public Health, sent an urgent email with a survey to everyone in the School. \"Are you able to help? What are your skills? Are you available to work on site?\" were among the questions Baseman asked. Around 700 responses poured in from faculty, staff and students. Th at enthusiasm is evident in the unprecedented response to the pandemic by academic public health professionals across the School. Faculty and students have bolstered the beleaguered public health workforce by training and deploying contact tracers. Th ey are providing public health departments with timely research on everything from infections in nursing homes and the public's adoption of masks to the pandemic's impacts on immigrant communities. Th ey're supporting the development of vaccines, treatments and technologies to combat the virus. And they serve as trusted experts who translate the science for the public, journalists and government leaders. \"One of the big benefi ts to working with the School of Public Health,\" said former Washington State Health Offi cer Kathy Lofy, \"is that they not only help us implement new things, but they study it at the same time, which gives us more information about the eff ectiveness.\" Designing innovations for public health practice One of those 'new things' might be on your cell phone right now. In collaboration with UW faculty from Schools of Public Health, Medicine and Computer Science, the Washington State Department of Health launched an exposure notifi cation phone application last November. Called WA Notify, it uses phones' Bluetooth signals to exchange anonymous codes with other nearby phones running the app. Users can then receive notifi cations \u2014 in 29 languages \u2014 when someone they have been in close contact with in the previous two weeks tests positive for COVID-19. Th e app, which uses a platform developed by Google and Apple, doesn't share when, where or by whom you were exposed. \"To me, it's kind of empowering,\" said Baseman, who chaired a diverse group of stakeholders advising the Department of Health on WA Notify and oversaw a test run at the UW. \"I really love the idea of having a tool that doesn't ID back to me personally, where I can do good for others if I test positive by letting them know they were exposed,\" she said. \"And likewise, I get the benefi t if somebody that I've been in close contact with tests positive.\" T raditional contact tracing has a number of limitations, including that people often don't know or can't remember everyone they've been in contact with in the last 14 days. It's also extremely resource intensive, and health departments at times have found themselves unable to keep up with the volume of cases. \"Th is technology is a privacy-preserving way to fi ll in some of those gaps,\" said Baseman, also a professor of epidemiology and adjunct professor of health services at the School. As of April 2021, 1.9 million users downloaded the WA Notify app, representing 25% of the Washington state population. Baseman and her colleagues will continue working with the Department of Health to evaluate the app, including whether it benefi ts communities disproportionately aff ected by COVID-19. Serving communities most in need Local health departments and government entities have also turned to the School for help collecting and analyzing information they can use to better target resources or communicate with communities most in need. India Ornelas, associate professor of health services, consulted with Public Health - Seattle & King County to understand the impacts of COVID-19 on Latina immigrants in the county. Surveying women who had participated in a program called Amigas Latinas Motivando el Alma (ALMA) to reduce stress, anxiety and depression, Ornelas found the pandemic had taken a big toll on their economic well-being. Nearly 40% of survey respondents said their work hours had been cut and 28% were not working at all. Seventy-two percent of respondents expressed concerns about obtaining food and 75% expressed concerns about paying for housing. Th e women also reported fi nding the online ALMA sessions valuable during the pandemic. Results of the survey were shared with the local public health department and the King 22 UW Public Health Magazine sph.uw.edu/magazine | 50th Anniversary Issue 23 County Latinx Community Response Team. \"A lot of these women are already living in precarious positions... and are at increased risk of poor mental health,\" Ornelas said. \"So it's really important to fi gure out if there are ways we can reach out to them.\" Other researchers at the School, this time in the Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS), developed a mapping tool for the City of Seattle to use to increase vaccine access and equity for the most vulnerable communities. Th e tool lets city offi cials and others compare, by ZIP code and census tract, COVID-19 case rates with social vulnerability conditions, such as high poverty, crowded households and limited vehicle access. \"Th e tool shows a pattern,\" said Esther Min, an alumna who led the project as a research consultant for DEOHS. \"Communities that have experienced high COVID-19 outcomes have high social vulnerability.\" Th e mapping tool, which was developed with Edmund Seto, associate professor of DEOHS, has helped the city decide where to place mobile and pop-up vaccine clinics as well as mass vaccination sites. Min said it could also inform when and where to mobilize vaccination events with local community leaders. Communities that are disproportionately impacted by climate change and other health and environmental issues \"are always hit fi rst and worst,\" said Min. \"When health departments and decision-makers think about vaccine access and equity, it's important to consider prioritizing frontline communities who often bear a greater burden.\" Making sense of the science COVID-19 has generated an unprecedented volume of research of varying quality. Without the time or skills to assess the quality of scientifi c evidence, the general public is vulnerable to misinformation about the disease. And already- overstretched public health workers needed help to stay on top of the constantly evolving science. Th at's why the Washington State Department of Health in May 2020 funded a UW team led by Brandon Guthrie, The new mapping tool developed by DEOHS shows Seattle zip codes by their level of vulnerability according to the CDC Social Vulnerability Index. assistant professor of global health and epidemiology, and Jennifer Ross, acting assistant professor of global health and medicine, to help sort the wheat from the chaff . A rotating crew of fi ve graduate students and four faculty screen roughly 400 articles a day, winnowing those down to the most relevant 10-15 to summarize as part of a daily COVID-19 Literature Situation Report. More than 5,600 people subscribe to the report, which is written to be useful to public health professionals but accessible to the general public. \"Our role is to help to translate the science and the huge amount of information that's coming out into actionable information,\" Guthrie said. Th e Department of Health's Lofy called the literature reports \"incredibly valuable.\" She and others leading the state's COVID-19 response read it every day, she said. Communicating in a crisis Public health academics are used to talking to each other about research, but they also have to be ready to communicate with a range of non-experts, especially in a pandemic. Th at's one of their most important roles, said Dean Hilary Godwin, who has testifi ed before Congress, sits on Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan's COVID-19 Task Force and regularly presents to business and civic leaders. \"My goal is to reinforce the messaging or priorities that have been put forward by public health agencies,\" Godwin said, \"and to make sure that people understand the public health concepts that went into those decisions they're putting out.\" Nicole Errett, an assistant professor of environmental and occupational health sciences, also made communicating about the pandemic one of her priorities. A disaster and public health policy researcher, Errett was fi elding dozens of media requests at the beginning of the pandemic because she knew how important it was to ensure accurate messages were getting out to the public. \"During an emergency, the public needs clear and consistent messaging that acknowledges that conditions and information will evolve, and guidance may change,\" Errett said. \"If public health experts don't provide that information, someone else will fi ll the void. And the information that a non-expert may provide runs the risk of being inaccurate or inconsistent with response goals.\" Th at could lead to misinformation, and even disinformation, and it could also erode the public's trust, she added. For some faculty, being thrust into the role of public communicators has been eye-opening. Marissa Baker, who is regularly quoted in the local and national media on the pandemic's impact on workers, said this experience has reinforced for her the important role that industrial hygienists play in keeping workers \u2014 and the public they interact with \u2014 safe and healthy. \"Occupational health isn't often on the front page of the newspaper,\" said Baker, an assistant professor of environmental and occupational health sciences. \"Interest from the media and general public in what I do has made me optimistic that there will continue to be a focus on the health of workers even as we get past the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic.\" Associate Dean Baseman said the pandemic has reinforced the need for schools of public health to better prepare both students and faculty to communicate eff ectively with the public, media and politicians. \"Especially in a time like we are in now, where politicization of these foundational public health measures is so extreme,\" she said, \"it makes the voice of experts like us, who work in the fi eld of public health, even more important.\" (L to R, starting from top) Janet Baseman, India Ornelas, Esther Min, Brandon Guthrie, Jennifer Ross, Nicole Errett and Marissa Baker. 24 UW Public Health Magazine sph.uw.edu/magazine | 50th Anniversary Issue 25 Courtney Schupp never imagined that her graduate research would involve digging through trash. Yet in 2017, Schupp found herself donning a lab coat and rubber gloves and meticulously sorting each bit of garbage, recycling and food waste from City of Auburn public school lunchrooms. Schupp was especially interested in the volume of untouched apples, unopened milk cartons and other still-edible food that could be \"rescued\" and used to feed hungry students or community members. Schupp's project, carried out with a team of nine undergraduates, was one of 16 in the University of Washington's inaugural Livable City Year program, which taps the creativity and expertise of students and faculty across disciplines to address local governments' sustainability goals. Students gain valuable real-world experience and professional connections, while cities benefi t from fresh thinking and added capacity to tackle high-priority projects. Cities \"come in not realizing how contagious the enthusiasm of the students is,\" said Jennifer Otten, Livable City Year co-director, associate professor in the School of Public Health's Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences and core faculty member of the Nutritional Sciences Program. \"A city not only gets these wonderful, well-done projects,\" she said, \"but community members connect with students in a diff erent way\" and get invested in the projects. In the program's fi rst four years, 861 students contributed more than 100,000 hours to 77 Livable City Year projects, with 12 being School of Public Health projects. Participating students and faculty have come from three campuses, 15 schools and dozens of disciplines, including public health, urban planning, business, law, nursing and more. In Auburn, a suburb south of Seattle, Schupp's food waste project uncovered some surprising results. Across the 15 Auburn schools they studied, the students found more than 85,000 calories of edible food in a single day of waste sorting, which could make a big diff erence in a city where 16% of people experience food insecurity and more than half of students are eligible for free or reduced- price lunch. Kathleen Edman, Auburn's solid waste and recycling coordinator, said the project gave the city valuable baseline data on schools' recycling and composting performance. \"We don't have the staff at the city, nor do we have the funds, to do waste sorts for the schools all the time,\" Edman said. \"It was an amazing collaboration.\" Th e students also gave each school an individualized report, which they used to improve their practices. Otten said that more of the schools have created \"share tables\" where students can leave unopened food for others to take and programs that send children home with backpacks of food. Schupp, who graduated in 2018 with an MPH in ILLUSTRATION BY GABRIEL LOPEZA fl ash mob of engagement Livable City Year matches UW, SPH student energy and expertise with local government projects WRITTEN BY ALLEGRA ABRAMO Nutritional Sciences, said she appreciated the chance to get out of the \"university bubble\" and do on-the-ground research. \"It's invaluable to be off the campus and see what's actually going on in the world,\" she said. Her fi ndings were published in the Journal of Agriculture, Food Systems, and Community Development in 2018. Otten, who co-authored the paper, contributed her expertise to a National Academies of Science study on reducing consumer food waste. At Bellevue City Hall in June 2019, students lined the light-fi lled concourse with posters highlighting their 30 projects, while the mayor, city council members and department staff ers asked them questions and pressed business cards into their hands. Many community members who had participated in the projects also showed up to support the students. Th e diverse projects on display that day included several by SPH students, including one outlining strategies to improve emergency communications with Chinese- and Russian- speaking communities, and another that assessed the health impacts of a neighborhood development plan. Using an equity and sustainability lens, students had also developed best practices for permitting food trucks in public spaces. Today Bellevue is piloting a downtown food truck program that incorporates insights from that work. As of winter 2020, Bellevue, a city near Seattle on the other side of Lake Washington, had begun implementing 17 of the projects, according to Danielle Verwahren, a management analyst for the city manager. \"A fl ash mob of engagement\" is how Livable City Year had been described to her, Verwahren said. \"And that,\" she said, \"was so incredibly accurate.\" Now Livable City Year is adapting the model to be more accessible to smaller cities that don't have the capacity to participate on the scale that Bellevue did. Last year, the program partnered with two local governments: King County and the town of Sultan, population 5,200. For King County, students provided research, analysis and recommendations regarding anti- displacement strategies that the county could consider for the urban unincorporated communities of Skyway-West Hill and North Highline. And in Sultan, students from diff erent courses worked over multiple quarters on a single project to update the city's parks and open space plan. Th is year, Livable City Year is conducting a data analytics project with the City of Lynnwood's parks department and is continuing its partnership with the City of Sultan. Th e program is also exploring partnerships with other communities in the future. \"Th ere's so much potential to continue building Livable City Year, even during the pandemic through projects that can be worked on remotely,\" Otten said. \"I'm just delighted by all of the opportunities I see.\" 26 UW Public Health Magazine sph.uw.edu/magazine | 50th Anniversary Issue 27 For Ivory Loh (MPH '20, Nutritional Sciences, Graduate Coordinated Program in Dietetics), food is not only a way to break barriers and build relationships \u2014 it's also a way to share stories and preserve culture and traditions. Loh led a project through funding from the 2019-2020 Husky Seed Fund to create the Husky Cookbook, which features over 60 diverse recipes and food stories, showcasing the diversity across campus. \"I hope that Huskies will continually refl ect on how food, family and culture have and continue to shape who they are, and use food as a way to connect with others to build lasting relationships,\" says Loh.In a pandemic-free world, Loh envisions the Husky Cookbook would evolve into a monthly potluck, where members of the UW community would get to know one another through food storytelling and learning about new cultures and cuisines. A group of SPH students launched a \"Healthy Eating\" social media campaign series in winter 2020 that features online cooking classes and recipes from the Husky Cookbook.

Firearm-related injuries are the second leading cause of death among adolescents, and every day approximately 100 people in the U.S. die from these injuries. Yet for more than 20 years, the CDC did not fund fi rearm research due to the passage of a 1996 amendment that prohibited them from using funds to advocate for gun control. Following an act of Congress that clarifi ed the meaning of the amendment, this fi nancial freeze came to an end in September 2020 when the CDC awarded more than $7.8 million to 16 research groups \u2014 including the UW and its partners \u2014 who are seeking to better understand and prevent fi rearm violence. \"Th is is a historic development and consequential milestone for the fi eld of public health in general, and the science of violence and injury prevention in particular,\" said Ali Rowhani-Rahbar, associate professor of epidemiology, who leads the study.Rowhani-Rahbar and his research team will examine youth handgun carrying in rural areas because these communities have high levels of fi rearm access and mortality, yet have been historically both under-researched and underserved. Th is study will use existing data and collect new data from rural adolescents to improve understanding of the cultural context, scope, risks, attitudes and patterns associated with handgun carrying. Researchers will also test the eff ectiveness of a community program that promotes healthy youth development. \"Th e goal of this project is to fi ll this knowledge gap and provide actionable evidence for informing strategies that can prevent fi rearm-related injury and promote safety among adolescents in rural communities,\" said Rowhani-Rahbar. Partners collaborating on this study include the UW Social Development Research Group, Harborview Injury Prevention and Research Center, Washington State University, Arizona State University and Seattle Children's Research Institute.UW among rst to receive CDC gun safety research funds in more than two decadesResearch Briefs Swab samples self-collected by patients are just as eff ective in identifying infections of the novel cornonavirus as samples collected by clinicians, according to a March 2020 study co-authored by Gerard Cangelosi, professor of environmental and occupational health sciences. Th e study found that tests using self-collected swab samples accurately detected COVID-19 in more than 90% of positive patients, which is consistent with the rate of clinician-collected samples. Based on this research, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has already updated its guidance, allowing patients nationwide to self-swab for COVID-19. \"Nasal swabs are extremely easy for anyone to self-collect, in any setting. So it's an excellent way to expand screening while reducing worker exposure,\" Cangelosi said. In addition to protecting frontline health care personnel, this form of testing also preserves personal protective equipment, such as face masks, gowns and gloves, and enhances COVID-19 testing effi ciency. Led by United Health Group Research & Development and OptumCare - one of the largest health care systems in the U.S. - the study included nearly 500 patients at OptumCare facilities in Washington state. Patients get green light to self-swab for COVID-19An international group of researchers \u2014 led by faculty from the UW Schools of Public Health and Medicine \u2014 have formed the United World Antiviral Research Network (UWARN) to combat emerging viral pandemics. Th is network was established through a fi ve- year, $8.75 million grant from the Centers for Research in Emerging Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. UWARN's timely goals include tracking emerging viral infectious diseases, developing urgently needed diagnostics and therapeutics, and expanding knowledge of viral immune responses \u2014 key to vaccine development. UWARN is being led by four UW faculty members: Judith Wasserheit, professor and chair of global health and professor of epidemiology at the UW School of Public Health; Peter Rabinowitz, professor of environmental and occupational health sciences and of global health at the UW School of Public Health; and Wesley C. Van Voorhis and Michael Gale, Jr., professors of medicine at the UW School of Medicine. In addition to the University of Washington, UWARN encompasses researchers from Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Rockefeller University and fi ve partner laboratories in Brazil, Senegal, South Africa, Pakistan and Taiwan. UW-led network to confront emerging pandemic viruses 30 UW Public Health Magazine sph.uw.edu/magazine | 50th Anniversary Issue 31 A new HIV prevention treatment called cabotegravir (CAB LA) proved 89% more eff ective than the current standard of care in a clinical trial \u2014 so eff ective that the study was halted early. \"It still amazes me how strong an eff ect we saw and that the study stopped at such an early interim analysis,\" said the study's lead statistician Jim Hughes, a professor of biostatistics with the UW School of Public Health. \"Th is is truly a once-in-a- lifetime event!\" Both CAB LA and the standard pill T ruvada are highly eff ective pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) treatments. However, people on T ruvada must remember to take a daily pill, while CAB LA is administered by injection every two months, making it an appealing alternative option.To test CAB LA's eff ectiveness, the study enrolled more than 3,000 women in seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Each woman received either CAB LA and a placebo pill or T ruvada and a placebo injection. While new HIV infection rates were extremely low for both groups, they were signifi cantly lower for those receiving CAB LA. CAB LA is now available to all participants in the study, which was run by the HIV Prevention T rials Network. Final analysis and regulatory approval are needed before it becomes widely available. At that point, Hughes predicts that CAB LA could contribute to major reductions in new HIV infection rates.HIV prevention injection nearly twice as effective as standard pill Women in sub-Saharan Africa face persistently high rates of HIV infection. However, a monthly vaginal ring is one step closer to becoming a tool they can use to protect themselves. Th e ring, which women can insert and replace on their own, slowly releases an antiretroviral drug called dapivirine into the vagina. After 16 years of research and development, the ring received a positive scientifi c review from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for use in women, ages 18 and older, who live in low- and middle-income countries. A team of investigators from all over the world \u2014 including the UW School of Public Health \u2014 conducted research that was submitted to the EMA as part of the ring's review process. If approved by African authorities, the ring would be the fi rst biomedical prevention method specifi cally for cisgender women (women whose gender identity matches their sex assigned at birth) and the fi rst long-acting prevention method. \"Th is is a critical step toward providing women with an HIV prevention tool that is discreet and fully under their control,\" said Jennifer Balkus, assistant professor of epidemiology at the UW School of Public Health. Positive review of dapivirine ring presents new milestone for women's HIV prevention Women hold two-thirds of the jobs in Washington state that present high risk of exposure to COVID-19 and off er low rewards \u2014 in the form of inadequate wages and benefi ts \u2014 according to a report co-authored by the UW School of Public Health and South Seattle College. Th e report examined data on Washington workers during the pandemic and identifi ed 55 occupations that are both low reward and high hazard due to elevated risk of exposure to the novel cornonavirus. Th ese occupations range from home health aides to retail salespersons to restaurant waitstaff . Roughly 900,000 people fi ll these 55 occupations, and 66.5% of these workers are women. Th ese workers, 70% of whom hold jobs deemed essential during the pandemic by Gov. Jay Inslee, are also disproportionately non-white; people of color constitute 35% of workers in these low reward/ high hazard jobs despite representing only 30% of Washington state's total workforce. \"We really need to ensure that there are targeted policies or regulations to help these workers, especially since we now know who they are and what occupations and industries they fall into,\" said Marissa Baker, assistant professor of environmental and occupational health sciences at the UW School of Public Health and co-author of the report. In order to determine which occupations were at higher risk of exposure to COVID-19 and to make specifi c recommendations for workplace safety, the researchers examined several dimensions of a job, including physical proximity to others, dealings with external customers and work with a team or group, among several other factors. Baker and her co-authors off ered four key recommendations that policymakers and business leaders can adopt to support the health and fi nancial well-being of workers: enacting airborne transmissible disease standards for workplaces, instead of relying on voluntary guidance; supporting comprehensive COVID-19 disclosure, testing and tracking; promoting and enforcing use of workplace safety committees; and ensuring workers have access to benefi ts, such as hazard pay and paid leave for quarantine periods. \"Even though this has been a devastating time for the American workforce, we can harness this moment and make big structural changes that can forever improve the relationship between work and health,\" Baker said. Women, workers of color lling most 'high- hazard/low reward' jobs in WashingtonResearch Briefs 32 UW Public Health Magazine sph.uw.edu/magazine | 50th Anniversary Issue 33 An online summer survey, the Washington State Food Security Survey or WAFOOD, co-created by the University of Washington, Washington State University and Tacoma Community College, revealed substantial disparities in food insecurity among households in King County, Washington. Food insecurity is a household-level economic and social condition of limited or uncertain access to food. Researchers launched the online survey to gather data about how the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent economic downturn have aff ected food access and economic security for Washington state residents. \"We know from increased demand at food banks and in food assistance programs that there has been a steep increase in food insecurity, but we don't know the details. How are needs changing?\" said Jennifer Otten, associate professor of environmental and occupational health sciences at the UW School of Public Health. Th e survey, which ran from June-July 2020, compiled results from 2,621 Washington state residents across 38 counties, and of those respondents, 861 lived in King County. Key fi ndings include that 30% of households in King County were food insecure; 57% of those households had children. By analyzing survey responses using participant-provided ZIP codes, researchers found that food insecurity was particularly prevalent in South Seattle and South King County. Th e survey also determined that respondents of color (42%) were more than 1.5 times as likely to be food insecure as white respondents (26%). A number of factors can contribute to food insecurity, including lack of income; limited access to grocery stores; lack of transportation; and instability in food production, processing and delivery; among many others. Th e survey found that rising food costs and reduced safety in grocery shopping were signifi cant barriers to adequate food access for King County residents. In addition to food access issues, many respondents living in food insecure households experienced other problems such as increased stress, anxiety and depression. Respondents living in food insecure households also experienced negative shifts in their eating habits, with 55% rating their diets as fair or poor. Of those reporting fair or poor diets, 78% said their diets worsened during the pandemic. \"Th e information gathered by this survey will help state and community partners understand what people are experiencing and help with resource allocation for Washington state residents,\" said Otten. Th e WAFOOD team anticipates releasing data from their second survey wave in the coming weeks. \"Th is next wave of data will tell us more about how food access issues and demand for food assistance have shifted later into the pandemic.\"Survey uncovers critical disparities in food insecurity among King County households Researchers have created an intervention for people behind bars that could help them beat opioid addiction. Th e intervention was tested with inmates suspected of opioid use disorder across four Washington state jails. Th e inmates met with a trained corrections staff member who off ered guidance about how to access treatment medications, such as methadone, buprenorphine or long-acting naltrexone, upon leaving jail. Th e study found that 16% of inmates who received the intervention started treatment medications after their release, compared to 8% of inmates in the group that did not receive the intervention. \"In the weeks after release, people with opioid use disorder are extremely likely to relapse and are at greatly increased risk from dying from an overdose,\" said Caleb Banta-Green, principal research scientist at the UW Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute and affi liate associate professor of health services at the UW School of Public Health, who led the study. \"Eff ective treatment medications dramatically decrease that risk.\"Intervention for prisoners could break cycle of opioid addictionResearch Briefs Northwest Center for Public Health Practice steps up to help prevent sexual violence Adolescence is often when people fi rst experience acts of sexual violence; however, the Northwest Center for Public Health Practice (NWCPHP), housed in the UW School of Public Health, intends to stop this pattern before it starts by evaluating the impact of an innovative program aimed at middle- schoolers. While other sexual violence interventions tend to focus on the individual, the Youth-Centered Environmental Shift (YES!) program is designed to prevent sexual violence at the school-wide level. Another key component of this evidence-based program is engaging students in the implementation process. \"We're really excited to explore this collaborative approach that centers students as the experts of their own experiences,\" said Andrea Wessel, sexual violence prevention specialist at the Washington State Offi ce of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI). In collaboration with OSPI and Harborview Injury Prevention and Research Center, researchers will collect data from students and staff at three middle schools piloting the YES! program over three years. \"Programs like this can have a much bigger eff ect on youth development and our communities by helping prevent harm before it happens,\" said Betty Bekemeier, director of NWCPHP . 34 UW Public Health Magazine sph.uw.edu/magazine | 50th Anniversary Issue 35 Before Miriam Flores came to the Master of Public Health (MPH) program at the University of Washington School of Public Health, she case-managed parents and pregnant women who were agricultural workers at a community health center in Othello, Wash. Many spoke an Indigenous Mexican language, Mixtec, and weren't profi cient in Spanish or English. Flores, who is also Mexican and did asparagus weeding when she was younger, became a trusted source as she shared information about prenatal topics, child development and health education with the parents-to-be in Othello. \"Th e community faced so many challenges \u2014 language barriers, access to health care, deportation or fear of deportation, and lack of aff ordable housing,\" says Flores. \"I realized I could better help communities like this by pursuing a master's degree in Maternal and Child Health.\" It's exactly that kind of work that the Remala family \u2014 Rao and Satya Remala and their daughters Srilata and Srilakshmi \u2014 wants to see more of in the fi eld of public health. Th at's why the Remala Family Foundation recently established an endowment in the School, specifi cally for graduate students pursuing their MPH. Th ey want this funding to support students from underserved backgrounds \u2014 like those who are among the fi rst generation in their family to attend college or have diverse lived experiences. Th e Remala family have made direct and impactful giving part of their family mission. \"Giving endowments is in our DNA,\" says Rao, who credits education with his success. From a small town in India, he studied there through his master's degree, and then worked to develop his country's fi rst microcomputer in 1978. He later attended the University of Washington to pursue his PhD in computer science before joining Microsoft in 1981 as one of the company's fi rst 50 hires. During his 23 years at Microsoft, holding a variety of positions, he helped develop and manage early versions of the Windows operating system, until retiring in 2004. Srilata and Srilakshmi followed their father's path, prioritizing education and the whole family shares a commitment to educational and public health advocacy and philanthropy. Elder sister Srilakshmi serves as a UW College of Education ambassador where the family also established an endowment to diversify the education workforce in the STEM fi elds. Rao hasn't forgotten his roots; one of the Remala Family Foundation's projects is building an eye hospital in his home village in Andhra Pradesh. Th ose roots inform the work their foundation does at the UW, too. \"Immigrant families work really hard and want their families to succeed,\" says Srilata. \"Th at ties back to this endowment where we're trying to create more opportunities for people of color.\" Srilata has fi rst-hand knowledge of these dynamics, as the founder of the Maternal Health Coalition, an organization FAMILY PHOTO BY JAKE MAGRAW @JMDMCREATIVERemala Family Foundation endows fellowship to increase diversity of MPH students WRITTEN BY STARRE VARTANA legacy of health and equality for all Graduate student Miriam Flores. that focuses on \"Ensuring all pregnant and parenting people have access to just and equitable healthcare.\" She's passionate about this subject, especially following the birth of her fi rst child, and thinks it's imperative to support and empower underrepresented people to fi ll leadership roles in public health to ensure healthier outcomes for all people. \"I think part of the problem is that [the Maternal and Child Health fi eld] has really been directed by people who don't understand what Black and Brown mothers go through, and what they feel when they are in these situations where they're not being seen or heard. So one huge thing that we're pushing for is more people of color, especially Black and Brown women, to be trained in maternal and child health services,\" says Srilata. Historically, the cost of education has been a barrier to these populations, which is where the Remala family endowment comes into play. \"If our endowment can fi ll the gap in someone's education to make it more accessible, that's really fantastic,\" says Srilata. Th e Remalas' goal aligns with the values of the School and the objective of its Campaign for Students (SEE PAGE 47 TO LEARN MORE) , which aims to attract and retain a diverse, equity-driven student body by increasing private fi nancial support. Flores, the MPH graduate student focusing on epidemiology, has seen the same gap Srilata seeks to address in her own work \u2014 and that's informed her choices. \"My plan is to fi nish the MPH program, and if possible, continue my education through a PhD and my epidemiologic research in the areas of pesticide exposure among agricultural workers \u2014 specifi cally among women, pregnant women and their children,\" she says. She also hopes to one day open a community health center. It's these dynamics that prove that every gift matters, says Rao, who sometimes considers his family's impact in light of some of the other big charitable organizations in the Seattle area: \"Th e Gates Foundation and Bezos \u2014 they're doing amazing work all over the world. Sometimes we ask ourselves, with a small foundation, what kind of impact can we make? But if we can provide free education for one woman of color, and she is going to go and make such an impact in the community \u2014 it does make a lot of diff erence.\" If you are interested in creating your own legacy in the UW School of Public Health, please contact Megan Ingram, associate dean for advancement, at mkingram@uw.edu or 206-616-7197.The Remala-Dorner-Kamdar Family.

Revolutionizing women's health care and environmental health research. Expanding access to mental health care. Tackling climate change, gun violence and houselessness. Fighting for health equity and human rights. T raining diverse public health leaders. Th ese are just a few ways the University of Washington School of Public Health's 50 Changemakers of Public Health are making a positive impact on the world. Th e 50 Changemakers, honored as part of the School's 50th anniversary, are distinguished alumni who have advanced the fi eld of public health through research, practice or education. Others are younger alumni just starting to make an impact but who have the power to inspire future public health leaders. Th ese public health champions represent a small slice of the School's community of more than 10,000 alumni worldwide who are addressing some of the most pressing population health issues of our time. Honorees were chosen in an open nomination process and selected by fellow School of Public Health alumni. Th ey represent all departments across the School and most interdisciplinary programs. In the midst of a pandemic and an unprecedented movement for social and racial justice, some of these changemakers are conducting studies to disrupt the spread of COVID-19, while many are working with community organizations to change the complex interplay of factors that keep some people from being as healthy as others. Among this list are renowned scientists conducting groundbreaking research to end the global HIV epidemic, prevent cancers and other chronic diseases, improve worker health and safety, and address gun violence in America. Th ere are also leaders of nonprofi ts, health systems and other schools of public health. Five of these changemakers have or are currently leading their nation's eff orts on health. Public health saves lives, and though local health departments have been chronically underfunded, our alumni have made amazing accomplishments in towns, cities and states across the United States and globally. Th ese changemakers have had to get creative to design programs and infl uence policy that protect communities from issues such as toxic chemical exposure and air and water pollution. Additionally, other innovators on our list are creating new approaches to understand big data and building the statistical foundation needed to make advances, improvements and breakthroughs in public health and medicine. Importantly, this group \u2014 like most of our alumni \u2014 is committed to health equity. Several folks have been vital to providing equitable health care and public health outreach to Black, Indigenous, Latinx, and refugee and immigrant communities, as well as the elderly and those aff ected by war and natural disasters. What's more, educators on the list are helping to prepare the next generation of public health professionals who embody the diversity of the communities they will serve.

Th e new Health Sciences Education Building, slated to open in 2022, will be nestled in the heart of south campus along Pacifi c Avenue. Th e 4-story, 110,000 square-foot building is designed to be a hub for all six health sciences schools, where students in dentistry, medicine, nursing, pharmacy, public health and social work can spend the day learning, both in and outside the classroom. Th e building's exterior will feature light-refl ecting glass and metal surfaces, a courtyard and terrace, but what's most striking is on the inside: an array of spaces \u2014 from large classrooms that accommodate up to 140 students to small breakout rooms for groups of eight \u2014 dedicated to active learning. Designing a student-centered building that serves the needs of all the health sciences requires a lot of planning \u2014 including input from faculty, staff and students \u2014 as well as funding. Th e state of Washington has invested $70 million in the $100 million project. Th e university is seeking to raise an additional $30 million in gifts from the community. Opportunities are available for naming spaces in the building. MORE ENGAGEMENT, BETTER OUTCOMES One way you know you are in an active learning classroom is by the sound. Rather than a single voice booming from behind a lectern, you'll hear the low rumble of multiple voices, students quietly brainstorming, sharing feedback and asking questions. \"Th e goal of active learning is to get students to learn with and from each other. You're actually taking advantage of the fact that you're all in a room together,\" says Sara Mackenzie, teaching professor for the Department of Health Services. For example, Mackenzie uses an active-learning technique called think-pair-share, where students fi rst refl ect individually on a question she has posed. Th en they share their ideas with a partner or small group, before joining a discussion with the entire class. Th ese types of active-learning techniques help students retain information and apply concepts to situations they are likely to encounter in the workplace. Active learning also presents opportunities for students to hone their speaking skills, particularly when discussing controversial topics. Betelehem Tessema, an undergraduate student majoring in public health-global health, felt too One building, six schools, infi nite possibilities New health sciences building to feature active learning and cross-disciplinary education WRITTEN BY MEREDITH BAILEY intimidated to raise her hand in class when she fi rst started college. \"My interactive classes taught me how to speak up in larger groups,\" says Tessema. \"Plus, it's really helpful to hear how other people are interpreting what we're reading or what we're doing.\" Th e new Health Sciences Education Building is designed with active-learning activities in mind. Classrooms will feature mobile tables and chairs that swivel to make it easier for students to converse with their neighbors. Multiple projection screens and whiteboards will be positioned around larger rooms. Th e classrooms will be distance-learning enabled, with care given to eliminate distractions, such as noise and By learning together in a shared building, health sciences students at the UW will learn to appreciate the diff erent skills and expertise that individuals bring to an interdisciplinary health prevention, promotion and care team. Th is is a primary goal of the new Health Sciences Education Building. \"We want our students to get out of their territories to consider who else can help them do what's right for their patients or the population,\" says Peggy Odegard, professor and associate dean at the UW School of Pharmacy. Odegard works in diabetes care, an area she says benefi ts from this sort of awareness, trust and teamwork. A cross-disciplinary approach to caring for patients with diabetes, which aff ects more than 460 million people worldwide, could lead to better health outcomes and reduce costs. Placing the patient at the center and involving physicians, nurses, pharmacists and dentists in their care could prevent heart attack and stroke, foot ulcers, blindness, kidney failure and poor oral health. Health administrators infl uence overall care quality and safety. Engaging social workers could ensure a patient's access to health education, mental health care and services such as food assistance. Importantly, stopping the diabetes epidemic will require collaboration with public health professionals who play a role in supporting proven interventions to prevent or delay the onset of diabetes, such as strategies that promote healthy nutrition and increase physical activity. Public health experts also have a huge task in bringing about systemic change through advocacy and policy work, says Gary Chiodo, a public health dentist and dean of the UW School of Dentistry. Th ey are key to ensuring that other health professionals and the U.S. health care system, in general, recognize upstream drivers of diabetes including income, education, housing and access to nutritious food and health care. It is important that health sciences students understand this bigger-picture view and that they take it with them into their practice, according to Chiodo. \"Learning alongside students in public health will catalyze that,\" he says.Changing the meaning of 'teamwork' to improve health outcomes Sara Mackenzie teaching class pre-pandemic (January 2020). 44 UW Public Health Magazine sph.uw.edu/magazine | 50th Anniversary Issue 45 inadequate lighting which is critical given that SPH and the other health sciences schools train students and provide continuing education training across not only the Pacifi c Northwest region, but also globally. \"Unlike a typical lecture hall with fi xed, tiered seating, and maybe one screen that not everyone can see well, these classrooms are fl exible, modern and designed for a multidirectional fl ow of information,\" says Hilary Godwin, dean of the UW School of Public Health. TEAMING UP ACROSS DISCIPLINES Team-based work facilitates learning among students in a class and across disciplines. An important focus of the six health sciences schools is interprofessional education (IPE): training students how to work together to improve the health of individuals and communities. \"I cannot think of a single job in public health where you just sit behind a desk and do your own work,\" says Godwin. \"To address the huge problems we're facing as a society, like the opioid crisis, you have to be able to collaborate with all kinds of people. If we don't train students how to do this now, then they won't be prepared for success in the workforce.\" Collaboration in public health practice and in health care settings has not only become the norm but also reduces costs and enhances both the delivery and experience of care. \"People across disciplines have diff erent ways of seeing the world and bringing them together yields more innovation and advancement,\" says Mackenzie. \"Th at's how you truly infl uence health outcomes.\" In addition to providing a variety of multidisciplinary-use classrooms, the new Health Sciences Building will feature an anatomy lab and \"skills lab suite\" where students across diff erent programs can participate in clinical simulations and practice working toward common goals. Th e building's IPE commons is a place where students from all the health sciences can gather between classes to engage in discussions or group work. Other informal shared spaces include a quiet study area, a collaboration lobby, a communal kitchen and library. \"It's not just about what happens in the classroom,\" Godwin says. \"We want students working together in diverse teams outside of class too, but to do that they need somewhere to congregate.\" Work on the new building began last summer and a formal groundbreaking ceremony was held on Aug. 27, 2020. As construction progresses, Godwin and other faculty members are brainstorming new educational possibilities. \"We're thinking about the ways we can leverage this space to develop new programs and to better meet the health needs of communities in our region and around the globe.\" To learn more about supporting the new building and opportunities for recognition through naming a space, please contact Megan Ingram, associate dean for advancement at the UW School of Public Health, at mkingram@uw.edu or 206-616-7197.

But they have also delivered a powerful lesson: a key to creating healthy, sustainable communities the world over is investing in a well- trained public health workforce. Th e UW School of Public Health is at the forefront of this mission \u2014 educating future professionals who can address the myriad problems facing us, from health disparities to opioid addiction to climate-change fueled natural disasters. To coincide with its 50th Anniversary, the School has launched its Campaign for Students, an initiative to ensure that resources are available to support future public health leaders who refl ect the communities they serve, as they progress through their studies and pursue their passions. Lift ing the nancial burden Th e School routinely attracts top talent, students like Sumaya Mohamed, who is interested in global health in the context of the global diaspora. Since her teenage years, she has been volunteering with organizations in South King County, Wash., that help East African refugees and immigrants live sustainable, successful lives. Mohamed brings an important lens and lived experience to her work that make her uniquely poised to lift up and leverage the strengths of these communities. Born in a refugee camp in Iff o, Kenya, Mohamed and her family relocated to Auburn, about 28 miles south of Seattle, when she was fi ve years old. \"My parents didn't speak English, and the systems refugees and immigrants have to navigate are really complicated,\" she says. \"Th ose experiences pushed me to focus on social justice and global health.\" Th e UW School of Public Health was an ideal place for Mohamed to pursue a master's degree in global health because of its high caliber program and proximity to numerous global health organizations. But there was one big obstacle: the cost. Th e School loses outstanding student candidates to other universities due to a lack of funding, a problem compounded by the high cost of living in the Puget Sound region. A priority of the SPH Campaign for Students is to increase funding for scholarships and fellowships, awards that can make higher education more attainable. T uition funding made all the diff erence for Mohamed, the fi rst person in her family to attend college and enroll in graduate school. She is a recipient of the Endowed Fellowship for Global Health Excellence, Equity and Impact. \"It lifted a brick house off my shoulders,\" she says. \"I can focus on my studies instead of worrying about how I'm going to pay for everything.\" Th is funding allowed Mohamed to continue her work with Mama AMAAN (Somali for \"safe motherhood\"), a project that explores the eff ectiveness of a community-developed and run program of pre- and postnatal care services among South King County's Somali immigrants and refugees. As an MPH student, she also assisted Sumaya Mohamed, MPH student, Global Health.SPH CAMPAIGN for sph.uw.edu/magazine | 50th Anniversary Issue 47 46 UW Public Health Magazinewith research in Malawi to understand the cultural acceptability and feasibility of a minimally invasive tissue sampling approach that can be used to understand cause of death among children. Facilitating collaboration Financial support alleviates stress for students, and it can also make it possible for them to engage in interdisciplinary training and collaborations that are essential to tackling complex public health problems. Antonio Olivas-Martinez, a physician, is pursuing a PhD in biostatistics to bring his two passions, mathematics and medicine, closer together. During his internal medicine residency at a prominent research hospital in Mexico City, Olivas-Martinez noticed that many medical professionals lacked literacy in health statistics. \"My colleagues would ask me to help them analyze data,\" says Olivas-Martinez, who has an undergraduate degree in mathematics. \"But statistics is its own language \u2014 knowing how to correctly interpret research is important for helping patients make informed decisions.\" At the UW School of Public Health, Olivas-Martinez, a Pat Wahl Endowed Fellow in Biostatistics, has focused on team-based, interdisciplinary work. He has collaborated with students of various public health disciplines to develop a proposal for a clinical trial. He has also participated in multiple research projects where he examines clinical data to improve the treatment of diseases such as breast cancer and COVID-19. Facilities that promote interaction and Antonio Olivas-Martinez, PhD student, Biostatistics. actionCALLED tointellectual exchange often catalyze partnerships among students and between students and faculty. Th ese types of collaborations will be greatly enhanced by the Health Sciences Education Building and Gilbert S. Omenn, MD, PhD and Martha A. Darling Environmental Health Research Laboratories, two new spaces that will increase the synergy between public health students and those from other health professions. Olivas-Martinez plans to continue the synergistic nature of his studies upon graduation through teaching and conducting research. \"One of the things I love about the fi eld of biostatistics is that it involves collaborations with everyone \u2014 that's how we make progress,\" he says. Supporting students to follow their passions When students have access to fi nancial support, it doesn't just increase their opportunities for collaboration and learning \u2014 it demonstrates that they matter. \"My awards made me feel like a valued part of the UW community,\" says Martell Hesketh, MPH '20. A graduate of the Community-Oriented Public Health Practice (COPHP) program, Hesketh was a recipient of the Rattlinggourd Endowed Scholarship & Fellowship and the Health Services Excellence, Equity and Distinction Award. Now, Hesketh works as a program evaluator at the Urban Indian Health Institute, a tribal epidemiology center that conducts research and supports Urban Indian Health programs across the U.S. Hesketh's relationship with the Urban Indian Health Institute began during graduate school; the institute served as the site of her summer internship and capstone project. Experiential learning opportunities like these, which allow students to apply their skills and knowledge in real-world settings, are an essential part of education at the UW School of Public Health. Support from donors helps to ensure that students are able to choose sites that match their passions, where they can make the greatest diff erence, regardless of whether the host organization has funding to hire them. Th e Campaign for Students will support a number of experiential programming enhancements, such as infrastructure development, increased staffi ng and stipends for graduate practicums. Other program-related campaign priorities include the establishment of a student emergency fund and expansion of the student mentoring program. Hesketh's fi eld-based learning experiences translated into a full-time job upon graduation. Th ey also positioned her to tackle complex public health issues, such as how to reframe what constitutes \"data,\" and to train others in Indigenous approaches to evaluation, an area she is deeply passionate about. She says, \"Instead of relying only on statistics to determine the success of a program, Indigenous evaluation is about honoring traditional ways of knowing, like storytelling, and collecting information that's actually meaningful to the community.\" A call to action Our ability to meet the public health challenges of the future is critically dependent on our ability to recruit and support students who share the lived experiences of the communities that we serve. Th is support not only makes the diff erence between whether students can aff ord our programs, it also gives them the fl exibility to work on complex, interdisciplinary research problems and provides the freedom from fi nancial burden to pursue their passions. We need your help creating a future that is centered on equity.

Since its start in 1980 as the Extended MPH Degree, the program has graduated more than 700 students. Many, like alumna Vickie Ybarra, now lead public health programs, agencies and nonprofi ts. Ybarra enrolled in the MPH program in the 1990s while working to expand prenatal care for migrant women and families in the Yakima Valley. \"I knew I needed more skills and training to best meet the opportunity of creating a more robust health care safety net for those in greatest need,\" she says. Th e program helped her to assess the causes and consequences of Yakima County's population transformation at the time to majority Hispanic births and then majority Hispanic children entering schools as immigrant families arrived in the valley. Th at experience, she says, strengthened her commitment to make lives better for children and families furthest from opportunity and set her on a policy leadership path. She now oversees the Offi ce of Innovation, Alignment, and Accountability for the Washington Department of Children, Youth, and Families. Today, the Online MPH Program is undergoing its own transformation with the launch of the \"Online MPH 2.0\" in Fall 2021. Th e revamped program will include a restructured curriculum, an enhanced online learning environment, courses that more closely align with the needs of the public health workforce, and a Spring quarter cohort in addition to its Autumn quarter cohort. As the program expands, students are being recruited from rural and tribal communities to build capacity for improving health equity across Washington state, Petrescu-Prahova says. By preparing a workforce to eff ectively tackle challenges among the most marginalized populations, the Online MPH Program is positioning the state's smallest communities for better health today and tomorrow. PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS Full-time, 18 month, six-quarter program Two entry dates - autumn and spring quarters Classes meet mostly online, with three on-campus sessions Working professionals earn an advanced degree in public health while continuing their careers Students take on leadership roles tackling public health challenges and promoting health equity and social justice Right: Coulee Dam, Wash. Credit: University of Washington When Leah Wainman sought a way to translate community conversations about mental health needs into data that could inform health care policy, she found the solution in her online classroom. A community engagement coordinator at the time for a North Puget Sound nonprofi t, Wainman was also enrolled in the UW School of Public Health's Online Master of Public Health (MPH) Program. During her workday she documented people's experiences with depression in rural counties to better link behavioral and physical health services; in her coursework she was learning about health data analysis \u2014 and found she could apply those tools directly to her job in real time. Th at's exactly the kind of value the School aims to provide with the Online MPH Program. \"Students can take what they learn in their classes back to their workplace every day,\" says Professor Jeff Harris, chair of the School's Department of Health Services and an Online MPH Program faculty member. \"It's not just theoretical.\" Th e program is designed for working professionals who want to grow their foundational knowledge and skills to improve health in their communities. Increasingly, the program focuses on training health leaders and practitioners to address inequities in Washington state's rural and tribal communities. Th e COVID-19 pandemic has brought attention to stark health disparities between rural and urban communities. \"We know there's a need to address these disparities, and the best way to do that is to train the workforce from those communities,\" says Miruna Petrescu-Prahova, director of the Online MPH Program. Th e Pacifi c Northwest's rural communities also lack data and infrastructure needed to tackle obesity, diabetes, tobacco use, mental health, violence and injury, and oral health, according to a 2019 study led by the School. Wainman, who earned her MPH in 2019, found that the data analysis skills she learned through the program were invaluable for ensuring community members' lived experiences informed policy development. Now an epidemiologist for Washington state's Island County Public Health and a member of the Governor's Interagency Council on Health Disparities, she emphasizes collecting and reporting health data disaggregated by race and ethnicity to better identify and make progress on health challenges facing people of color on Whidbey and Camano islands. \"In rural communities,\" says Wainman, \"marginalized populations are just that \u2014 they're marginalized. Th ey're not necessarily out there and seen. ... If you don't see somebody, you don't count them.\" Th is approach to illuminating the needs of underserved communities has stayed with alumna Donalda Dodson since she completed the MPH program in 1985. As the executive director of Oregon Child Development Coalition in Wilsonville, Ore., Dodson and her team support the families of migrant and seasonal workers to address diabetes, child nutrition, infant safe sleep, and other health challenges unique to their largely transient populations. Dodson says the MPH program helped her develop the mindset and confi dence to approach health issues from a new perspective and tackle them more eff ectively. \"One of our instructors said, 'You're not always going to be able to articulate how what you're learning now will impact what you're doing,'\" Dodson recalls. \"'But you will be able to notice if you're doing it diff erently.'\" Th e 18-month program draws students who are at various stages in their careers. Th rough weekly online classes, independent and group coursework, a practicum, and a capstone project or thesis, students learn cutting-edge tools and approaches to understand and address health issues facing their communities. Public health practitioners who teach the courses bring their varied fi eld experiences into the classroom, while students enhance the conversation through their own Online MPH Program helps professionals tackle rural health inequities WRITTEN BY EMELINE COKELET MENEKEN FOUNDED ALUMNIBY THE NUMBERS 92% of graduates surveyed reported the program advanced their careers Online MPH alum Leah Wainman 50 UW Public Health Magazine sph.uw.edu/magazine | 50th Anniversary Issue 51 In addition, the Field Research and Consultation Group lab will be renovated, which will be ideal for prototyping new devices and keeping sample collection materials that are important to have on hand for larger, population-based research studies. Elaine Faustman, director of the DEOHS Institute for Risk Analysis and Risk Communication, says she'll be using the new labs and they will have an \"exponential impact\" on some of the most important work DEOHS scientists do. Faustman works to identify metals such as arsenic and cadmium that may cause negative health eff ects in children. She'll be using the new labs for \"low-level metal analysis capabilities, which is critical as the neurodevelopmental toxicity of metals continues to plague our region as well as our nation,\" says Faustman. She and Omenn launched a multi-school course at the UW on Risk Assessment and Risk Management in 1982 that remains popular to this day. Th at kind of far-reaching, large-scale public health work is exactly the kind of science Omenn and Darling aim to support with their gift. \"As revealed to all during this pandemic, making a diff erence at the scale of populations \u2014 through innovative and trusted science, systems of public health services and compassionate care, and encouragement of healthful behaviors \u2014 fi ts with the School and its role in President Ana Mari Cauce's Population Health Initiative,\" says Omenn. In thanks for this gift and previous gifts to the School and his long-standing commitment to public health, the UW is honoring Omenn with a new annual lecture focused on how science informs risk assessment and public engagement. Th e annual lecture will be hosted by DEOHS in the fall quarter. DEOHS Chair Michael Yost says he's building an incubator environment for both faculty and students. Th is lecture is part of that idea: \"Th e transformational experience this off ers our students is the unique combination of scientifi c skills and communication skills needed for eff ective collaboration,\" says Yost. Omenn and Darling hope to inspire others to \"help make a better world, whatever their career or community focus.\" Along with a focus on the natural world, Omenn says, \"We want to inspire an appreciation for the interaction of individual diff erences and responsible behaviors with all kinds of environmental exposures, then to reduce disease risks and enhance wellness.\"If you are interested in creating your own legacy in the UW School of Public Health, please contact Megan Ingram, associate dean for advancement, at mkingram@uw.edu or 206-616-7197.ABOUT GILBERT S. OMENN Omenn came to the UW in 1969 as a fellow in Medical Genetics with pioneering UW Professor Arno G. Motulsky. In 1971, Omenn joined the faculty in the Medical Genetics tracks in Internal Medicine. He launched the Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholars Program in 1975 across the UW Schools of Medicine, Public Health and Business. Meanwhile, he also served in Washington, D.C. as a White House Fellow at the Atomic Energy Commission and later as an associate director of the White House O ce of Science and Technology Policy and O ce of Management and Budget. He returned to the UW in 1982 in the School of Medicine and as chair of DEOHS and then as dean of the School of Public Health from 1982 to 1997. Omenn championed toxicology, eco-genetics and risk assessment as research foci for DEOHS, which led to the School receiving major funding from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and Environmental Protection Agency. In 1997, Omenn moved to the University of Michigan to serve as chief executive o cer of the Health System and executive vice president for medical a airs. For the past 15 years, he has led the University-wide Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics and the global Human Proteome Project. In addition, he is an a liate professor at the UW School of Public Health in DEOHS. Gilbert S. Omenn and Martha A. DarlingLouis Pasteur, discoverer of vaccines, stated a major truth: \"Without laboratories, men of science are soldiers without arms.\" Lab work was at the heart of making large-scale population health advances in his era \u2014 and it's just as true today. As a fellow public-health champion, Gilbert S. Omenn knows how right Pasteur was: he and his wife, Martha A. Darling, have recently bestowed one of the largest gifts ever received by the UW School of Public Health \u2014 specifi cally for new environmental health research laboratories at the School. \"Well-equipped laboratories and outstanding staff are essential to detect chemical, microbiological and physical exposures from the environment and drive progress in reducing such exposures and their risks to our health,\" Omenn says. Omenn credits his parents and his mentors for fostering his broad interdisciplinary interests and his drive to contribute to a better world. Professionally, he has embraced basic research, innovations in clinical genetics, public policy and leadership roles through the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, the National Institutes of Health, the biotech world and a presidential and congressional commission on risk. \"When I graduated from Harvard Medical School, my speech on behalf of the class was 'On Curiosity,'\" Omenn says. Th at curiosity informed his life's work. \"Asking compelling questions for which we may have no current answers and taking the roads 'less travel'd' can be stimulating throughout our lives.\" Omenn's wife, Martha, who he met 46 years ago in Paris, has a similar attitude about her career in international economics, fi rst as a White House Fellow at the U.S. T reasury, then at Boeing and later in education policy. \"I have always been drawn to problem solving. One challenge is fi nding the right tools. I view our investment in this suite of labs as providing vital tools to SPH students, faculty and partners as they address all sorts of environmental problems and work toward formulating solutions,\" says Darling. Th at marriage of curiosity and problem solving is at the heart of Omenn and Darling's gift: \"Experimental science depends on insightful hypotheses, cutting-edge technologies and places to bring together committed and collaborative researchers and students,\" says Omenn. To that end, he sees newer and smarter lab spaces as imperative for the future of public health. \"Th is truly is a transformative gift,\" says Dean Hilary Godwin. Th e old labs were \"tired\" and not state of the art, she notes. Th is was particularly surprising considering the strength of the laboratory research program in the School's Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS). In addition, the labs provide essential services for the state of Washington that began in 1951 with the Environmental Health Laboratory, which supported research into air pollution for local government. Th ese services expanded in the 1960s to improve occupational health for the state's workers via public worker compensation funds. \"Having up-to-date facilities is absolutely essential to maintain DEOHS's strong rankings and competitive research program as well as their ability to continue serving the needs of the state,\" says Dean Godwin.

Th e group would repeat these steps several times for a few minutes, and then they'd get to work. Th is is not a common practice in meetings in academia, but it is how a team leading equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) eff orts at the School began each of their meetings in 2020, a year unlike any other. As the world stared down a deadly virus devastating Black, Indigenous and Latinx communities, saw a new moment of reckoning on racism, and anxiously awaited the results of a future- shaping U.S. presidential election, the SPH EDI team took a moment to breathe. Th e breathing exercise helped Owens, an EDI research assistant, to center herself \u2014 to bring her awareness and attention to how she was feeling in that moment and to set intentions for the diffi cult work ahead. Much of that work over the last 10 months has been focused on developing the fi rst in a series of School-wide anti-racism trainings. Th is is just one step on a larger road map guiding the School toward becoming an anti-racist institution, a charge that is long overdue and has been driven by students. Also on the road map are strategies to improve the way the School attracts, hires and matriculates faculty, staff and students from diff erent backgrounds, and to remove barriers that prevent them from being successful. Th e School is taking a hard look at the way students are educated, research is conducted and other operations are handled, at the same time recognizing there is still a lot of healing that needs to take place. Th is inward gaze is a vital part of the School's pursuit to dismantle systemic racism, a public health issue that requires acting to undo the racist policies that continue to shape everyday realities of health for communities. \"People know what health disparities are intellectually but they don't know it spiritually,\" says Owens, who studies in the Department of Health Services and also has master's degrees in clinical psychology and global mental health. \"When you talk about health disparities, you're talking about my uncle who died because he avoided treatment at a hospital due to COVID-19 and my older cousin who works in public transportation and is now on life support because of COVID-19. How do we start changing the conversation so it's not so intellectual but you actually feel it in your heart and you understand that these are real lives that matter?\" Th is is a hard question to answer, and the challenging task to fi nd a solution seems to rest on the shoulders of EDI team members and volunteers. It's clear that having these tough and uncomfortable conversations is necessary to bring about the kind of change Owens and others want to see, and that the Close your eyes. Take a deep breath in through your nose. Exhale all the air out through your mouth. 54 UW Public Health Magazine sph.uw.edu/magazine | Spring 2021 Issue 55 School is committed to making. A seismic shift is also needed in the way leadership, faculty, staff and students think about themselves and how they maintain racist structures. \"Anti-racism work is a journey and we're at the very beginning,\" says Victoria Gardner, assistant dean for EDI, who joined the School in 2018. Gardner now has a team that includes rukie hartman, an Offi ce of the Dean staff er who supports EDI part time, and Ahoua Kon\u00e9, co-chair of the SPH EDI Committee, a School-wide governing body. \"Th ere isn't one right way to undo 500 years of racism and, to be clear, the School is likely never going to fully become anti-racist,\" says Kon\u00e9, a clinical assistant professor in the Department of Global Health. \"Even the slightest change will be hard to achieve.\" Th ough this team has taken on the hard and harrowing responsibility to discover and implement strategies to help move the School along its path, every person within the institution must also see themselves in this work. Th e positive news is that there is a starting point, as the School launched its new anti-racism training in the fall of 2020. Created by Gardner, Kon\u00e9 and hartman, in collaboration with Owens and a School-wide anti-racism work group, the training takes a community-based approach that emphasizes continuous unlearning and relearning at the individual, interpersonal and system levels. Participants are introduced to race, racism, anti- racism and white supremacy culture in organizations as well as techniques for modeling anti- racist behavior. Th is provides the School a shared language and framework, what hartman says has historically been non-existent. So far, nearly 200 core faculty and 230 staff have taken part in the fi rst training sessions off ered by the EDI team. Th e School will continue to off er the training through 2021 and is committed to seeing this type of work continue into the future. To complement the universal training, faculty, staff and students are urged to build upon their anti-racism practice in affi nity groups, community spaces where problems can be discussed and solved. People can also engage in additional skills- and action-based trainings that address issues such as microaggressions. Additionally, they can take part in activities or programs centered on a Common Book for all members of the School community. Fittingly, this academic year, the School is reading \"How to Be an Antiracist\" by Ibram X. Kendi as its Common Book. To establish accountability and transparency, the School will need to collect data on these trainings, along with other activities, and develop metrics to measure their impact. Th e team recognizes that this is not an easy thing to do, and \"people will have to reconsider and critically think about what it means to 'measure' this sort of thing,\" Gardner says, \"Anti- racism training doesn't typically have benchmarks.\" Says hartman: \"Th e goal shouldn't be to show how great we are in numbers. It's about that cultural change and knowing there is a sense of trust in our community. To me, the real measure of good EDI work is how people feel, and it's much harder to measure feeling.\" Following the murder of George Floyd in May 2020, Dean Hilary Godwin was motivated by a call from more than 300 students to create School-wide anti-racism training, and she entrusted the EDI team with developing it. Th e initiative \u2014 and the School's greater EDI road map \u2014 was also informed rukie hartman is an O ce of the Dean program operations specialist who supports EDI part time.Ahoua Kon\u00e9 is co-chair of the SPH EDI Committee, a School-wide governing body.\"There isn't one right way to undo 500 years of racism and, to be clear, the School is likely never going to fully become anti-racist.\" by earlier work led by faculty members Amy Hagopian, Clarence Spigner and India Ornelas to develop a curriculum competency requiring all students in the School to \"recognize the means by which social inequities and racism, generated by power and privilege, undermine health,\" according to their published paper. A similar curriculum competency was also adopted by the Council on Education for Public Health for accredited MPH programs after recommendations were made by the School's curriculum committee. \"Th e article is a wonderful gift from the authors to help all of us, not just students, think about how we can do our work better,\" Gardner says. \"We want to challenge people in the School to take this on as part of their individual work to become better humans and better public health professionals.\" Th ese acts of innovation continue to happen in EDI committees in departments across the School. Folks in the Department of Epidemiology recently produced a course development tool to help instructors modify their teaching and course materials to refl ect EDI and anti-racism principles. In 2019, a team from the Department of Global Health led a qualitative study that depicted the lived experiences of people in the School and defi ned priority areas of improvement. Th e study was funded by a Diversity and Inclusion Seed Grant from the UW's Offi ce of Minority Aff airs with matching funds from the department and the School's Offi ce of the Dean. Owens says this sort of funding is important to propel EDI and anti- racism eff orts forward and to signal a commitment to change. She and other students have been key to moving EDI forward, off ering their voices to compel the School to address its own racism. According to Owens, students want to see more funding for EDI, more representation at all levels of the School and more anti-racist principles incorporated in public health teaching and research. Some of this work is already under way throughout the School. Owens is hopeful about the School's anti-racism journey and the role she can play, but she is also mindful of her own well-being, she says, and the breathing exercises have helped. \"Th ese trainings encourage us to have the uncomfortable dialogue about hundreds of years of discrimination and racism in public health,\" she says, \"and that dialogue continues to move us along the path toward creating a more diverse and inclusive environment within the School.\" Th e School may make mistakes along its journey to become anti-racist, but it is the accountability, refl ection, growth, continued learning and actions that come next that truly count, she says.
