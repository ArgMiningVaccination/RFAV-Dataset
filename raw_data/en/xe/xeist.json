WRITTEN TESTIMONY ONLY ON SENATE BILL NO. 420 S.D.1- RELATING TO NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE TO THE HONORABLE ROSALYN H. BAKER, CHAIR, AND TO THE HONORABLE DAVID Y. IGE, VICE-CHAIR, AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE: The Department of Commerce and C onsumer Affairs (\"Department\") appreciates the opportunity to testify on Senate Bill No. 420 S.D.1, Relating to Naturopathic Medicine. My name is Jo Ann Uchida, Complaints and Enforcement Officer for the Department's Regulated In dustries Complaints Office (\"RICO\"). The Department takes no position on the bill, but offers the following comments. Senate Bill No. 420 S.D.1 contain s a number of amendments to the Naturopathy chapter, authorizes natur opathic physicians to administer parenteral Testimony on Senate Bill No. 420 S.D.1 March 3, 2009 Page 2 therapy, authorizes naturopathic phys icians to obtain Federal Drug Enforcement Administration registration and prescribe controlled substances, and authorizes naturopathic physicians to administer intr avenous, subcutaneous, and intramuscular injections. The bill also prov ides for a defective effect ive date of July 1, 2050. Senate Bill No. 420 S. D.1 significantly expands the scope of practice for naturopathic physicians. Th e bill as drafted gives the Board authority to promulgate rules to establish the medicati ons that may be prescribed by licensees (page 13, lines 6-7), permits the Board to annually publish a list of Board-approved medications that may be prescribed (page 13, lines 20-21), and prohibits licensees from prescribing medications not approved by the Board (page 18, line 4). The bill also includes a definition of \"naturopathic formulary\" (page 8 lines 10-14) that would be determined by rules established by the Board. The Department understands that th e terms \"medications\" and \"naturopathic formulary\" as used in the bill are in tended by the bill's proponents to be synonymous. The Department suggests that the terms be reconciled to avoid confusion or misunderstanding regarding their meaning. Also, the Board's adoption of parent eral therapy guidelines and approved medications may take some time, in th e event this bill becomes law. The Department, therefore, suggests that the Board be given authority to promulgate rules, including guidelines, standards of practice, and a list of approved medications, at the time the law is en acted, but that implementation of the remaining provisions of the bill be delayed. This will ensure that adequate Board- Testimony on Senate Bill No. 420 S.D.1 March 3, 2009 Page 3 approved standards will be in place when th e law goes into effect. If the bill is enacted without a staggered effective date, the Department is concerned that licensees will be precluded from admini stering even those natural medicines currently within their scope of practice unt il the Board approves and adopts a list of medications. Thank you for the opportunity to submit written testimony on Senate Bill No. 420 S.D.1.

No. 420, S.D. 1 is to amend the title of the chapter regulating naturopathy to \" naturopathic medicine\"; define and clarify the scope of \"naturopathic medicine\"; aut horize naturopathic physicians to administer parenteral therapy (i.e., treatments by injection) and obtain Federal Drug Enforcement Administration registration; and authorize the Board to issue temporary licenses to out- of-state naturopathic physicians in a declared public health emergency. The Board has not had the opportunity to review this measure however the Board has taken a position in support of t he intent of S.B. No . 420 with the following amendments which also pertain to S.B. No. 420, S.D. 1: Written Comments on Senate Bill No. 420, S.D.1 March 3, 2009 Page 2 1. Delete the new section entitled \"Parenteral Therapy\" on pages 1 and 2 of the bill because the amendment to HRS section 455-6(2) on pages 12 and 13 will allow the Board to establis h requirements regarding parenteral therapy in the Board's administrative rules; 2. Delete subsection (b) on page 5, lines 16-18, in the new section entitled \"Exceptions; scope of chapter\" because it is already addressed on page 4, lines 5-8; 3. Clarify the definition of \"R adiography\" on page 10 as follows: \"Radiography\" means the or dering of all radiograph ic diagnostic and other imaging studies, including but not limited to computed tomography scans, x-rays, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography scans, and ultrasounds. The term also means and includes the taking and interpreting of x-rays. \" The Board believes that this amendm ent reflects the types of education and training that is taught in naturopathic medical schools; and 4. Amend the definition of \"Naturopathic formulary\" by deleting \"in accordance with rules established by the board\" on page 8, lines 13 and 14; Amend the proposed HRS section 455- 6(2) by deleting the phrase \"establish medications that may be prescribed by licensees\" on page 13, lines 6-7; and Amend the proposed HRS section 455-6(7) on pages 13 and 14, lines Written Comments on Senate Bill No. 420, S.D.1 March 3, 2009 Page 3 20-21 and 1, by changing to the following: \"(7) Annually establish and publish a naturopathic formulary that has been approved by the board that may be prescribed, administered, or dispensed by naturopathic physicians; . . . \" These amendments clarify t hat the Board has the specific authority to annually establish and publis h a naturopathic formulary that lists the vitamins, minerals, dietary s upplements, botanical medicines, homeopathic medicines, hormone s, and those legend drugs and controlled substances consistent with naturopathic medical practice that naturopathic physicians are able to pre scribe, administer, and dispense. The Board believes that it has the expertise to independently determine the naturopathic formulary that natu ropathic physicians are taught in naturopathic medical schools and at the same time, protect the public. Thank you for the opportunity to provide written comments on Senate Bill No. 420, S.D. 1. HAWAII SOCIETY OF NATUROPATHIC PHYSICIANS 1481 S. King Street, Suite 312 Honolulu, Hawaii 96814 Dr. Kevin Gibson Legislative Committee Member TESTIMONY BEFORE SENATE COMMERCE AND CONSUMER PROTECTION COMMITTEE The Honorable Rosalyn H. Baker, Chair The Honorable David Y. Ige, Vice Chair SB 420, SD1, Relating to Naturopathy For a hearing scheduled Tuesday March 3, 2009 at 9:30 AM, Conference Room 229. March 1 , 2009 Chair Baker, Vice Chair Ige and Members of the Committee: I am Dr. Kevin Gibson, licensed naturopathic physician and acupuncturist, and registered environmental specialist. I serve on the Naturopathic Board of Examiners, but I am testifying on behalf of the Hawaii Society of Naturopathic Physicians (HSNP) who write in SUPPORT of SB 420, SD1. This testimony is offered in three parts to facilitate your review . The first (I .) presents some history and the need for this legislation. The second (II.) contains the amendments recommended by the HSNP, the Naturopathic Board of Examiner s (Board) and HSNP's understanding of the intention of the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, Regulated Industries Complaints Office (RICO) which did not make it into the Senate Health committees senate draft one. The HSNP understands that these amendments were left out due to time constraints and not with purpose. The HSNP supports these amendments and have had ongoing dialogue with RICO since the Health Committee hearing to find common ground and ensure their intentions and public safety is protected. The third (III.) area of discussion is in response to late testimony submitted by the Hawaii Medical Association (HMA) f or the Health Committee hearing which we suspect will come up again in the testimony you receive for this hearing. I. The need for this legislation is presented as follows: This legislation would allow naturopathic physicians to practice medicine as they are trained to as primary care providers. As with any health care profession, naturopathic medicine is an evolving field. To provide our patients with the best care possible we seek to keep our practice law up to date. The last modification to naturopathic practice law was over twenty years ago and naturopathic medicine has evolved significantly over that time. Our state and nation are in a health care crisis and part of that crisis is the lack of qualified primary care doctors. Naturopathic physicians can be part of the solution to this crisis, but we must not be limited in our practice to be most effective. Our curren t law is unclear about some practice areas such as the parenteral administration of vitamins, minerals and amino acids; our prescriptive authority and minor office procedures. These practice areas are taught in the curriculum of naturopathic schools, and are included in the scope of practice for naturopathic physicians in the majority of states in which they are licensed, including California, Oregon, Washington, Montana and Arizona. Parenteral administration of v itamins, min eral, and amino acids are an important part of naturopathic practice and are not a service customarily supplied by conventional health care providers. Vitamin, mineral, and amino acid injections are very beneficial for a variety of health conditions, including immune enhancement, correcting nutrient deficiencies, and eliminating toxic substances such as heavy metals (lead, mercury, etc.). Naturopathic physicians provide a valuable service to public health and safety by offering this treatment. Past History: Naturopathic doctor s licensed here in Hawaii and nationwide have been administering natural substances including vitamins, minerals and amino acids subcutaneously, intramuscularly and intravenously (i.e., injection routes) for approximately twenty years. The current naturopathic governing statute, HRS 455 states naturopathic doctors may use the \"...natural methods or modalities, together with natural or homeopathic medicines, natural foods, and herbs, and nature's remedies of the type taught in education and training at naturopathic medical colleges.\" Because injection routes are taught in naturopathic medical colleges, doctors have chosen in the past to safely utilize these effective methods. The naturopathic governing board issued an opinion in 1984 that the injection of vitamins was within the scope of practice of naturopathic physicians. There has not been one case of misuse or harm caused by these methods reported to the state licensing board or the state member society. In addition, naturopathic malpractice insurance c ompanies insure practitioners using these techniques. The largest insurance companies offering malpractice insurance have not received one malpractice claim throughout the nation against a naturopathic physician for the misuse of injection methods. There were no complaints brought to the Board of Naturopathic Examiners in regard to the use of these injectable natural medicines by naturopathic physicians during this time. In 2006, the legislature approved HB1155 which clarified that naturopathic physicians have the authority to administer natural medicines by injection, although the bill was vetoed by the Governor. In addition to clarifying the use of parenteral therapies, this bill would give the Board of Naturopathic Medicine the authority to determine the naturopathic formulary. This would help to safeguard against the misuse of any \"new\" natural substance and protect public health. The Board has the expertise to determine this formulary. II. HSNP's recommended amendments and supportive reasoning for these amendments to SB420, SD1 are presented here. A great deal of supportive testimony was received at the Senate Health Committee hearing on February 11, 2009 from the general public and naturopathic and allopa thic medical communities. The Board submitted supportive testimony at the hearing that recommended amendments to the bill. Ms. Jo Ann Uchida, Complaints and Enforcement Officer RICO submitted recommended amendments as well. The HSNP agrees with the amendments made by the Senate Health Committ ee from the testimony submitted by the Board and the intention yet not the specifics of testimony submitted by RICO. MICHAEL - DID ANY OF RICO'S RECOMMENDATIONS ACTUALLY MAKE IT INTO SD1? IF NOT I WILL DELETE THE LANGUAGE IN THE LAST SENTENCE AFTER \"the Board.\" After speaking with Senator Ige's office, it is our understanding that the Health C ommittee was not able to complete all corrections due to time constraints. In our review of SB420, SD1 we believe all amendments were completed with the exception of the Board's following suggestions, which the HSNP supports: 1. Delete the new section entitled \"Parenteral Therapy\" on pages 1 and 2 of the bill because the amendment to HRS section 455 -6(2) on pages 12 and 13 will allow the Board to establish require ments regarding parenteral therapy in the Board's administrative rules. 2. Delete subsection (b) on page 5, lines 16- 18, in the new section entitled \"Exceptions; scope of chapter\" because it is already addressed on page 4, lines 5 -8. 3. Clarify the defi nition of \"Radiography\" on page 10 as follows: \"Radiography\" means the ordering of all radiographic diagnostic and other imaging studies, including but not limited to computed tomography scans, x -rays. magnetic resonance imaging. positron emission tomograp hy scans. and ultrasounds. The term also means and includes the taking and interpreting of x -rays.\" This amendment reflects the type of education and training that is taught in naturopathic medical schools. 4. (a) Amend the definition of \"Naturopathic formulary\" by deleting \"in accordance with rules established by the board\" on page 8, lines 13 and 14; (b) Amend the proposed HRS section 455- 6(2) by deleting the phrase \"establish medications that may be prescribed by licensees\" on page 13, lines 6- 7; (th e HSNP believes (a) and (b) will adequately address RICO's draft CPN testimony concern about the need to reconcile the terms naturopathic formulary and medications), and (c) Amend the proposed HRS section 455- 6(7) on pages 13 and 14, lines 20- 21 and 1, t o the following: \" (7) Annually establish and publish a naturopathic formulary that has been approved by the board that may be prescribed, administered, or dispensed by naturopathic physicians; . . . \" These amendments clarify that the Board has the s pecific authority to annually establish and publish a naturopathic formulary that lists the vitamins, minerals, dietary supplements, botanical medicines, homeopathic medicines, hormones, and those legend drugs and controlled substances consistent with naturopathic medical practice that naturopathic physicians are able to prescribe, administer, and dispense. The HSNP believes the Board has the expertise to independently determine the naturopathic formulary that is consistent with what naturopathic physicians are taught in naturopathic medical schools and at the same time, protect the public. The HSNP's also request s a change of the effective date to July 1, 2009. RICO's draft testimony for this hearing recommends that a staggered effective date be implem ented . HSNP believes this is not necessary. RICO and the HSNP have had ongoing productive dialogue since the Senate Health hearing but were unable to continue discussion regarding the recommended staggered effective date due to the time constraints /unava ilability imposed by the weekend. HSNP believes RICO interpreted the proposed amendment language of HRS section 455- 6(7) \" allows the Board to establish and publish a naturopathic formulary that has been approved by the board that may be prescribed, administered, or dispensed by naturopathic doctors ;...\" to preclude naturopathic doct ors from utilizing any formulary or medicines in the treatment of disease. Naturopathic doctors currently use vit amins, minerals, amino acids fatty acids , dietary supplements, botanical medicines and homeopathic medicines to treat and prevent disease. These are non -prescriptive substances, with the exception of a limited number of vitamins and amino acids, and are therefore not at risk of being outside our scope of practice unt il a published list is adopted by the Board. Naturopathic doctors diagnose and treat disease as primary care physicians. Our ability to do so will not change from its current standing, but will only be enhanced as the Board establishes an updated formula ry which reflects modern naturopathic standards of treatment and care. III. HSNP's response to the Hawaii Medical Association's (HMA) late SB420 testimony submitted to the Senate Health Committee is presented here. As physicians, we all take a well known oath known as the Hippocratic Oath. Above all else this oath states \"first do no harm.\" Harm can mean harm to an individual patient; it can mean harm to a community. For over 60 years there has been an evolving relationship between naturopathic physicia ns and medical doctors. In recent time naturopathic physicians and medical doctors frequently collaborate on behalf of patients with patient referrals going both ways. Naturopathic physicians and medical doctors participate together on various health commissions and community outreach programs. Naturopathic physicians have been admitted to hospital medical staffs in Hawaii and have been appointed to county health task force councils. Yet with this growing cooperation in health care on behalf of the people of Hawai i, the HMA continues to live in the past and resists acknowledging the value of these accomplishments. This late testimony of the HMA demonstrates a profound misunderstanding of modern day naturopathic medical practice. In doing so, they not only m isrepresent the truth about naturopathic medicine and naturopathic physicians but they persist in characterizations that are more a reflection of political resistance and rhetoric than sound evaluation and review. Unlike nurses, nurse practitioners and ph ysician's assistants, naturopathic physicians practice independently of medical doctors. It is no more appropriate to require direct physician supervision of naturopathic physicians performing injections than it would be to require direct naturopathic phy sicians supervision of medical doctors performing a physical exam or giving nutritional advice. Furthermore, naturopathic medical students receive training in parenteral therapy administration, and conventional medical students do not. HMA's statement that \"There are no existing quality standards for the preparation of the materials that would be allowed for naturopathy injection and there is no evidence of any benefits,\" is patently false. The substances that are used by naturopathic physicians for parenteral therapy are FDA approved vitamins, minerals, and amino acids in injectable forms that are prepared by FDA approved manufacturers according to strict standards of quality and strength, and also administered under sterile conditions. If no evidence of any benefit existed, then these substances would not be FDA approved. The purpose of regulation - public protection - should have top priority in scope of practice decisions, rather then professional self -interest. This encompasses the belief that the public should have access to providers who practice safely and competently. Changes in scope of practice are inherent in our healthcare system. Health care and its delivery are necessarily evolving. Health care practice acts also need to evolve as health care demand and capabilities change. Overlap among professions is necessary. No one profession actually owns a skill or activity in and of itself. One activity does not define a profession, but it is the entire scope of activities within the p ractice that make any particular profession unique. Simply because a skill or activity is within one profession's skill set does not mean another profession cannot and should not include it in its own scope of practice. Practice acts should require licensees to demonstrate that they have the requisite training and competence to provide a service. Graduation from an approved school and a passing score on the Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Examination (NPLEX) demonstrates that a naturopathic physician licensed in Hawaii has achieved competency to practice as taught in naturopathic medical school. The term \"traditional naturopath\" is a myth. A \"traditional naturopath\" is the self - chosen title of someone who is self -educated or has done coursework at home using a mail- order school. The term \"traditional naturopath\" is a term that was first used within the last ten years and is simply a euphemism for people who have taken courses from a correspondence school and choose to call themselves naturopaths. Although the \"traditional naturopaths\" claim that NDs who have graduated from naturopathic medical schools accredited by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME - the only accrediting agency recognized by the US Department of Education to accredit schools and programs of naturopathic medicine) do not practice \"real\" naturopathy, this claim can be easily debunked by examining the history of the profession in the US. The naturopathic profession in this country was founded by Dr. Benedict Lust over a hundred years ago. His first act was to establish a college to provide education for this new type of practitioner. Its educational standards were typical for the medical colleges of the time. The naturopathic licensing laws for from that era, for example, in Florida and Utah, included the broadest scope of practice possible, because the profession was clearly seen as medical. The profession was conceived and still exists as a medical practice. States have developed laws over the years to make the naturopathic scope of practice reflective of modern educational standards and public needs. Naturopathic Physicians are trained to diagnose and treat disease - the so -called \"traditional naturopaths\" are not - and this is completely consistent with the profession's history and development. There is not a single \"traditional naturopath\" in the state of Hawaii, as the use of the title naturopath, naturopathic physician, or any term that implies such is legally restricted to those who have hold a license to practice naturopathic medicine in Hawaii. In conclusion, the HSNP sees the \"turf war\" that the HMA wants to engage in as a conflict with no winners, only losers, which include the people of the state of Hawaii who need the services of naturopathic physicians who can practice to the full extent of their training and thereby help to alleviate the serious shortage of primary care providers. The testimony of MDs in support of SB420 is evidence that the HMA does not represent the interests of medical doctors in Hawaii, and certainly not the interest of those who wish to have access to naturopathic medicine. Thank you for the opportunity to testify on this matter. 1Eric Arquero From: miss pacchamama writting in re: to measure SB420SD1, hearing set for March 3, 2009 at 9:30 am. i am writting to express my sincere appreciation and support for natuopathic medicine. over the years i have personally experienced positive results while under the care of a naturopathic physician and witnessed several of my friends and family members do the same. i think the individuals of hawaii and the state as a whole would greatly benefit this bill. thank you for your consideration. abigail hummel Access your email online and on the go with Windows Live Hotmail.

I have been a patient of Dr. Laurie Steelsmith for over 10 years, and have benefitted greatly from Naturopathic medicine. I believe it would be a great service to our community to allow Naturopathic physicians like Dr. Steelsmith to be able to practice using the full range of their training and skills. Thank you, Allaine Kelly 1Eric Arquero From: Carla joaquin Laurie\" Relating to Naturopathic Medicine Senator Rosalyn H. Baker, Senator David Y. Ige and members of the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection. I am writing to strongly urge your support for S.B. 420, S.D.l I am currently a resident of Hawaii and have been back to my home here in Waimanalo for the last twenty years. My family and I are patients of Dr. Laurie Steelsmith, a naturopathic physician, practicing here in Honolulu. She has provided outstanding naturopathic care for my entire family. Unfortunately Hawaii's Naturopathic law does not allow my medical insurance to reimburse me for much needed medical care. Naturopathic physicians are an integral part of our nation's health care system. A comprehensive law allowing medical care by these highly trained medical professionals will significantly enhance health care here in Hawaii. President Obama and his current administration have made Health Care a priority in healing America and returning our nation to the world's leader in the care of it's citizens. Hawaii will always be my home, not for its natural beauty but mainly for the people that make up this great state. Collectively you, our state senators and representatives set the standards for our lives here in Hawaii. Please allow us to have the ability to choose our health care professionals and give us a mechanism to pay for these services.

Ige and Rosalyn H. Baker, I am writing to you in support of bill SB 420 SD1 relating to Naturopathic Medicine. I am a patient of Dr. Laurie Steelsmith and me and my family have seen her for over 10 years for our naturopathic medical care. It is my understanding that naturopathic p hysicians have extensive medical training at naturopathic medical schools but are not able to practice their full scope of medical skills in Hawaii. It is time to modernize the Hawaii State naturopathic law which has not been revised in 20 years. As a pat ient of Dr. Steelsmith I have been treated for a wide variety of conditions which has brought me to a higher state of health and wellness. Please pass this bill as I know passing it will give naturopathic doctors in Hawaii a greater scope of practice that will enable them to better serve the people of Hawaii. General practitioners are invaluable and help decrease the work load of the medical specialists, who are generally overwhelmed with the current demand. Indeed, many of them are no longer able to take on new patients, leaving individuals to look elsewhere for therapies. Preventative medicine and lifestyle changes can promote a healthier Hawai'i, while decreasing the financial burden of healthcare costs. I ask that you please consider a modernization o f scope of practice for naturopathic physicians for the benefit of all the citizens and visitors to Hawai'i. Thank you for your consideration.

Ige, and other Members of the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection, As a longtime Hawaii resident I very strongly support Measure S.B. No. 420, S. D.1 as it relates to naturopathic medicine in Hawaii. Naturopathic phys icians are by far the most highly trai ned preventive medicine experts, but in Hawaii they cannot yet practice ac cording to the full scope of their medical training. Many other states have passed measures that allow naturopathic physicians a much broader scope of pr actice than they currently have in Hawaii. In order for our state to attract more top-qualit y naturopathic physicians, we very much need to update our naturopathic law - especia lly given the current economic climat e, with many physicians leaving the state. In keeping with the Obama administration's ai ms to cut health care costs by promoting preventive medicine, it is high time to give Hawaii's naturopathic doctors greater ability to practice preventive medicine according to their training. By supporting measure S.B. N o. 420, S.D.1 you will greatly increase the quality of healthcare in our state. Many thanks for reading this letter, and fo r giving this bill your consideration.

No. 420, S.D. 1 This letter is in support of S.B. No. 420, S.D. 1, relating to Naturopathic Medicine in Hawaii Feb. 28, 2009 Dear Senator Rosalyn H. Baker, Senator David Y. Ige, and other members of the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection, I am a Hawaii resident, a concerned citizen, and a user of Naturopathic Medicine in addition to traditional medicine for myself and my family. I strongly urge your support of Measure S. B. 420, S. D. 1 as it relates to Naturopathic Medicine. My daughters and I are currently under the care of Dr. Laurie Steelsmith, as an adjunct to our traditional doctors. We see Dr. Laurie Steelsmith because she treats the whole person, not just the symptoms of disease. She is an excellent doctor very knowledgeable in nutrition and wellness and hence in the prevention of disease. We do not believe that the pharmacological treatments (drugs) given by traditional doctors should be the only way to treat illness. Dr. Steelsmith spends extensive time getting to know the whole person, treating the whole person, and getting to the underlying causes of the disease. She is a firm believer in educating the patient in disease prevention and using diet, exercise, stress reduction, and the like to improve the patient's well being. We are very satisfied with her care and believe that this bill will enable naturopathic doctors to have a wider scope of practice and will enable Dr. Steelsmith and other naturopathic doctors to more effectively serve the people of our state. Naturopathic doctors are most highly trained in preventive medicine and are uniquely qualified to promote a healthier Hawaii while decreasing the longterm financial burden of healthcare costs. Prevention and education are much more cost effective than treating an advanced disease with high cost western medicine \"cures\".

Ige, and other Members of the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection, I am a Hawaii resident and a concerned citizen, writing to strongly urge your support of Measure S.B. No. 420, S.D.1 as it relates to naturopathic medicine. Naturopathic physicians have extensive medical training at naturopathic medical schools, yet in Hawaii they have minimal insurance coverage and are unable to practice their full scope of medical skills. It is time to modernize the Hawaii State naturopathic law, which has not been revised in 20 years. Measure S.B. No. 420, S.D.1 will give naturopathic doctors in Hawaii a greater scope of practice that will enable them to more effectively serve all the people of our state. With the current state of the economy, many physicians are leaving our state. As general practitioners who are licensed in Hawaii as primary care physicians, naturopathic physicians are an invaluable part of our healthcare system. Other types of doctors are overwhelmed with the current demand, often making it difficult for patients to receive even basic medical care. Allowing naturopathic physicians to practice according to their training will greatly increase the quality of healthcare available to the citizens of this state. Furthermore, given that naturopathic physicians are most highly trained in preventive medicine, they are uniquely qualified to promote a healthier Hawai'i while decreasing the longterm financial burden of healthcare costs. Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing of the passing of this bill.

No . 420, S.D.1 (hearing scheduled for Tuesday, March 3, 2009, 9:30 a.m.) Importance: High February 28, 2009 Re: In support of Measure S.B. No. 420, S.D.1, Relati ng to Naturopathic Medicine in Hawaii (Hearing scheduled for Tuesday, March 3, 2009, at 9:30 a.m.) Dear Senator Rosalyn H. Baker, Senator David Y. Ige, and other Members of the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection: As a fifth-generation Oahu resi dent who has lived on this island for more than 50 years, as a concerned taxpayer and registered voter here of decades, and as a strong propone nt of the availability of excellent health care for all residents of Hawaii, I strongly urge you to support Meas ure S.B. No. 420, S.D.1 as it relates to naturopathic medicine. As a patient of Dr. Laurie Steelsmith, a naturopathic physician and author of a comprehensive book about women's health, I have been very impressed with Dr. Steelsmith's knowle dge of health symptoms and her ability to treat them naturopathically . In particular, Dr. Steelsmith was able to help me greatly improve a physical condition that my regular medical doctor (M D) could not fix over a pe riod of more than four years. My allopathic physician, a medical docto r (M.D.) at my health maintenance organization (HMO), diagnosed me with hypothyroidism about five year s ago and then treated me for about four years with only Levothyroxine. However, I still di d not feel well and told her of my continued symptoms. She did nothing further to improve my health. Ironi cally, to treat a physical condition of the body, my regular MD offered me antidepressants on three separate occasions, but I refused them each time because I did not feel depressed. Feeling very frustrat ed, out of desperation to get some re lief from the fatigue I was feeling, I finally went to see a naturopathic phy sician for the first time in my life. It was Dr. Laurie Steelsmith. I described my physical symptoms to her and she suspected immediately, based on many similar case histories, that my physical problem wa s my body's inability to convert T4 to T3. My regular MD at my HMO never even tested me for T3 in more than four year s! I believe she was cluele ss about the source of the problem! I am now taking T3 supplemen tation and am feeling much better. This experience opened up my world to naturopathic me dicine. For your reference, naturopathic physicians have received extensive medical training at natur opathic medical schools (for information regarding this training, please visit http://www.naturopathic .org/viewbulletin.php?id=29 ). Nevertheless, in Hawaii, naturopathic physicians have minimal insurance coverage and are unable to practice their full scope of medical skills. I strongly believe the time has come to update the Hawaii State naturopathic law, which has not been revised in 20 years. The passage of Measure S.B. No. 420, S.D.1 will allow naturo pathic doctors in Hawaii, such as Dr. Steelsmith, a greater scope of practice. This, in turn, will enable the people of Hawaii to receive a wider range of health and medical care. Furthermore, with many physicians currently leaving our state and with many types of doctors overwhelmed by patient demand, it is often difficult for patients to rece ive even basic medical care, let alone receive care for 2and treatment of diseases and serious illnesses. With th e alarming deficit of medical practitioners in Hawaii at this time, it is imperative that our state government take proactive measures to help correct this unacceptable situation. Additionally, naturopathic phys icians, as general practiti oners who are licensed in Hawaii as primary care physicians, play an extremely significant role in our state's healthcare system. If our state government allows naturopathic physicians to practice according to their training, the people of Hawaii will benefit greatly from an increasing availability of h ealth care and medical services. Additionally, because naturopathic physicians are hi ghly trained in preventive medicine (not just in trea ting disease that already has attacked the body), they are uniquely qua lified to promote a hea lthier Hawaii. Naturopa thic doctors can help keep people healthy and can help prevent people from becoming ill. By keeping people healthy and by minimizing disease, naturopathic doctors not only can he lp prevent the pain of illness and the ultimate loss of life, but they can help our state decrease its overall medical expenses . And, especially in this economy, wouldn't that be nice! Considering the above, I urge you to vote in favor of Measure S.B. No. 420, S.D.1. Thank you very much for your interest and consideration. I look forward to the passage of this bill and to the positive results it will bring to the pe ople of Hawaii and to our state budget.

Ige, Chair, Honorable Senator Josh Green, M.D., Vice Chair Re: SB420 Relating to Na turopathic Medicine February 11,2009 Dear Senators Ige, Green and Committee Members: Aloha. My name is Diana Joy Ostroff. I am a licensed Naturopathic Physician and Doctor of traditional Chinese Medicine. I have been practicing on Oahu for 20 years , taking care of Hawaii residents who are looking for an alternative or complement ary care to assist them in attaini ng optimal health and well-being. I am a member of the Hawaii Society of Naturopathic Phys icians and the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians, as well as a past member of th e licensing Board of Naturopathic Medicine. I write to you today seeking your support of SB 420. The passage of this bill will en able licensed naturopathic physicians to practice in the manner in which we have b een trained. As it was last revised 20 years ago, our statute is clearly out of date. At that time, our law included the provision that we can practice as we are taught. Naturopathic medicine, like allopathic medicine, has evol ved significantly since that ti me. ND's are trained as primary care providers. The current law places significant re strictions on our ability to provide primary care in Hawaii. The purpose of regulation should be public protection. This should be the top priority in the scope of practice regulation. This encompasses the belief that the public should have access to providers who practice safely and 2competently. Changes in scope of practice are inherent in our healthcare system. Health care and its delivery are necessarily evolving. Health care practice acts also need to evolve as health care demand and capabilities change. Collaboration between health care providers should be the professiona l norm, and overlap among professions is necessary. No one profession actually owns a skill or activity in and of itself. One activity does not define a profession, but it is the entire scope of activitie s within the practice that make any particular profession unique. Simply because a skill or activity is within one profession's skill set does not mean another profession cannot and should not include it in its own scope of pr actice as well. All pract ice acts should require licensees to demonstrate that they have the requi site training and competence to provide a service. As there is clearly a healthcare crisis in Hawaii as well as nation wide, we as natu ropathic doctors are trained and licensed to be part of the solution and w e ask for your support in passing SB 420 , for the modernization of our law which will be clearly defined to serve Hawaii' s resident's with the utmost care and effectiveness Much Aloha and Mahalo, Dr. Diana Joy Ostroff No virus found in this incoming message.

As a patient of Dr. Kevin Gibson and Dr. Laurie Steelsmith, my family and I have seen both for naturopathic medical care, and as a result we have significantly improved our health. Naturopathic physicians have extensive medical trainin g at naturopathic medical schools, yet in Hawaii they have minimal insurance co verage and are unable to practice their full scope of medical skills. It is time to modernize the Hawaii State naturopathic law, which has not been revised in 20 years. Measure S. B. No. 420, S.D.1 will give Dr. Steelsmith and other naturopathic doctors in Hawaii a gr eater scope of practice that will enable them to more effectively serve all the people of our state. With the current state of the economy, ma ny physicians are leaving our state. As general practitioners who are licensed in Hawa ii as primary care physicians, naturopathic physicians are an invaluable part of our healthcare system. Other types of doctors are overwhelmed with the current demand, often ma king it difficult for patients to receive even basic medical care. Allowing naturopathic physicians to practice according to their training will greatly increase the quality of he althcare available to the citizens of this state. Furthermore, given that naturopathic physicia ns are most highly trained in preventive medicine, they are uniquely qualified to pr omote a healthier Hawai'i while decreasin g the long-term financial burden of healthcare co sts.

No 420 relating to Naturopathic Medicing in Hawaii RE Measure SB No 420 SDI in relation to Naturopathic Medicine in Hawaii To Whom It May Concern: I am a Hawaii resident, born and raised here. For many year s I have jumped around from medical doctor to doctor to find a cure for my ailments. My Naturopathic Doc, Dr. Laurie St eelsmith, has helped me out tremendously in the past years. In the past year, we hit a bump in the road and was unable to treat my condition. I do believe this is because Dr. Steelsmith's scope of practice here in Hawaii is limited. I traveled to San Francisco, CA to seek medical attenti on. He was able to administer a DMPS test for heavy metal toxicity. Dr. Steelsmith is unable to provide this test because she is not able to give \"shots.\" I had to pay for travel and lodging, out of state MD fees, non covered internist fees for phone consults, shipping on supplement orders, etc. If Dr. Steelsmith was able to provide this service, I would not have to pay the extra expense. Please consider passing this bill so that Dr. Steelsmith and other NDs may treat their patients. Ellen M.

No. 420, S.D.1 as it relates to naturopathic medicine. As a long-time patient of Dr. La urie Steelsmith, my family and I have seen her for naturopathic medical care, and as a result we have significantly improved our health. In three cases, she has been able to supp ly me and my family with care that cured when traditional methods could not. Yet for many Hawaii residents they cannot afford to s ee a naturopath because of th e costs, on top of already paying for their traditional health coverage. I believe that all residents should have the choice to use th eir health coverage on the t ype of care of their choice. These doctors are highly trained, offer less invasive (and less expensive) procedures, and provide the patient with information that empowers the patient to make positive lifestyle ch anges and in many cases cures their health issue and stops the progr ession of future problems. Naturopathic physicians have extensiv e medical training at na turopathic medical schools, yet in Hawaii they have minimal insurance coverage and are unable to practice their full scope of medical skills.

No. 420, S.D.1 Relating to Naturopathic Medicine in Hawaii (Hearing scheduled for Tuesday, March 3, 2009, at 9:30 a.m.) Dear Senators Rosalyn H. Baker, David Y. Ige, and Members of the S enate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection: We are Hawaii residents and concerned citizens, writing to strongly urge your support of Measure S.B. No. 420, S.D.1 as it relates to naturopathic medicine. We are patients of Dr. Laurie Steelsmith for approximately three years. We have seen her for naturopathic medical care, and as a result we have significantly improved our health. Prior to becoming patients of Dr. Steelsmith, we also were patients of Dr. Jack Burk in Waimanalo. Dr. Burk also afforded us excellent naturopathic care. Naturopathic physicians have extensive medical training at naturopathic medical schools, yet in Hawaii they have minimal insurance coverage and are unable to practice their full scope of medical skills. It is time to modernize the Hawaii State naturopathic law, which has not been revised in 20 years. Measure S.B. No. 420, S.D.1 will give Dr. Steelsmith and other naturopathic doctors in Hawaii a greater scope of practice that will enable them to more effectively serve all the people of our state. It is our belief that there is also a need for alternative health care and naturopathic medical care can fill part of the existing health care gap. With the current state of the economy, many physicians are leaving our state, some have left the medical profession altogether. Healthcare premiums are steadily increasing, however, patient care has been diminishing. There is a viable need for quality health care. As general practitioners who are licensed in Hawaii as primary care phy sicians, naturopathic physicians are an invaluable part of our healthcare system. Other types of doctors are overwhelmed with the current demand, often making it difficult for patients to receive even basic medical care. Allowing naturopathic physicians to practice according to their training will greatly increase the quality of healthcare available to the citizens of this state.

Lock ~ Waimanalo, Hawaii, 967'95 PAGE 102/102 THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE AND CONSUMER PROTECTION THE TW!:NTY-FIFTH LEGISLATURE REGULAR SESSION OF 2009 TUESDAY, MARCH 3, 2009 at 9: 30 AM TESTIMONY ON SENATE BILL NO. 420 S.D. 1 TO: THE HONORABLE ROSALYN BAKER, CHAIR, AND TO THE HONORABLE DAVID Y. IGE, VICE-CHAIR: I am Jack Burke, NO, Past President of the Hawaii Society of Naturopathic Physicians, and former Chairman of the Hawai'! Board of Naturopathic Examiners. I am testifying in support of S8420. I ask for your support of this bill for the following reasons: Our country is truly facing a crisis in health care. Contrary to what some say, this is not solely due 10 malpractice insurance, nor low reimbursements. Although these are important conSiderations, there is a deeper issue. Not only are there fewer and fewer family practice physicians, but the model that is being employed by mainstream medical physicians is reactive rather than proactive. Naturopathic Physicians are trained to empower patients to enact the lifestyle changes which have been clearly shown to avert chronic, debilitating and expensive iIInes$es. We are taught not to just suppress symptoms, but to see them of signs of Imbalance in the body, and in the everyday choices which people make in their life.' Patients are hungry tor this information -they come in and ask \"what can I do \", and they don't want to just hear \"take a pill.\" This bill will enable Naturopathic Physicians to practice more effectively, and to utilize the skills which they have been taught. Several years ago, for instance, I had a patient with neurological problems related 10 lead toxicity. I called a well known hematologist about chelating the lead out. He was aware that this was the correct tre~tment, but he was forced 10 tell me that no MOs performed this ttreauttlment. Wlth~ut a ~aturopathic physician, this patient would have continued o s er from bram poisoning There are m ti because ~opathic physicians have not ~~~~~I1~~~:ro suff~rneedlessly Scope of pr~cttce.

Aloha, I am a 71 year old senior lady, and I love my naturpathi c doctor that has helped me immensely with my Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Theraphy and it is all natural, plantbased from wild yam extract and soy formulated especially for me in a bioidentical lab and augments my natural existing hormones....and I am telling you, my cholosterol went down 55 points to 170 a nd also this therapy helps me with heart and cancer protection, bone protection and helps the mind against al zheimers, and its good for libedo, I do not want to end up in a nursing home, but through this wonderful natural theraphy it keeps women and men healthier, and think of the money the state could save to have this accessable! To: CPN Testimony Subject: Re: SB420 SD1 Relating to Naturopathic Medicine I support this bill. Having had the care of several Naturopathic physicians, I appreciate their skills and training. This bill will clarify their practice and provide some of the tools they should have in order to best serve Hawaii's people. Thank you, Johanna Chung 44006 Testimony Subject: support for SB NO. 420, S.D1, relating to naturopathic medicine Dear Senator Rosalyn Baker, Senator David Y. Ige, a nd other Members of the Senat e Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection: As a passionate believer in integrative and preventive medicine, I'm writ ing in support of S.B. No. 420, S.D.1, Relating to Naturopathic Medicine in Hawaii. Clearly it's time to give nat uropathic medicine the support it deserves, and which we so desperately need. My father was a physician on Kaua'i in the days before ce ll phones and Physicians Exchange. He made house calls all over the island and never charged those who couldn't afford care. Those days are gone, of course, and so is the kind of medical care that treats the patient as a complete and whole human being. While sp ecialization is necessary, we still have a need to be assessed, considered, and treated as whole, f unctioning organisms rather than just a conglomeration of discrete parts. I feel that naturopathy is the closest thing we have to this kind of care. Greater support of naturopathic medicine will help reduce health costs because it is preventive by nature. Natu ropathic physicians are rigorously trained, and it's time for them to be considered and included in our mainstream health care system. With so many physicians leaving Hawai'i, it's often diffi cult to get appointments, ev en for acute conditions. Many physicians are no longer taking new patients. By passing this bill, you w ill be giving the residents of Hawai'i a wonderful new opportunity to improve their health, decrease the over-all heal th burdens of the state, and elevate the quality of their lives. Thank you, Jocelyn Fujii 1615 Wilder Ave., Apt. 606 to Naturopathic Medicine 03/03/09 9:30 a.m. My name is Dr. Joseph Kassel, N.D ., L.Ac.. I have worked in health care since earning my nursing degree with honors in 1979. I have worked as a Naturopath and Acupuncturist sinc e earning those degrees with honors in 1988. I served on the Oregon Board of Naturopathic examiner s in the mid 1990's. I have lived and provided primary affordable health care in Kona since 2002. I am testifying in favor of passage of SB420. When I sat on the Naturopathic Board in Oregon, we went through a similar process in which we modernized our administrative rules to reflect current education and common practice of Naturopathic Physicians. At that time I actually held a fairly conservative position, concerned that some of these changes could distract our profession from its fu ndamental roots. While this may occasiona lly be true, what the changes did for the rest of us was simply allow us to provide optimal therapies for patients expeditiously and cost effectively. While I have a strong commitment to traditional Naturopath ic modalities, there is not a week that goes by in which a modern modality could not complement the therapies that I provide to a patient. For many of my patients, my limited scope of practice results in thei r not acquiring that additional treatment, usually for financial reasons. We live in a time when we are confronted with rising health care costs. One means of reducing these costs is to prevent redundant office visits to a second practitioner for the same condition. I have committed my career to providing accessible health care. Our current Naturopathic law is on occasion an obstacle to being able to do this and unfortuanately sometimes prevents the prov ision of optimal care. Clearly the passage of this bill will require an enorm ous amount of work for the Na turopathic Board to implement responsibly. I have little doubt that they will have the support of local and national authorities to carry this out. The vast majority, if not all other states licen sing Naturopaths have laws similar to SB420. I hope you will seriously consider its passage, so that we can better care for those who seek our help. Sincerely, Joseph Kassel, N.D., L.Ac. 1Eric Arquero To: CPN Testimony Subject: SB420 Relating to Naturopathic Medicine Aloha, I am writing to express my support of SB420 which would change the current laws regarding the ability of naturopathic doctors to practice to th e full extent of their training. Please pass this bill and bring Hawaii up to the same standards held by many other states. Sincerely, Joy Blais Joy Blais CPN Testimony Subject: Support Bill S.B.No. 420, SD1 Relating to Naturapathic Medicine in Hawaii I support and recommend the above bill. I use and believe in Natu apathic Medicine. In Hawaii, we would like to have more natural choices to care for ourselves. We believe in natural health methods. I am a cancer survivor of 12 years, an d attribute my good health to natural remedies, advice and holistic methods of care. At times, this can be an difficult economic hardship, and I would greatly appreciate having insurance assistance. It can make a difference in my quality of life.

As a patient of Dr. Laurie Steelsmith, I have seen her for naturopathic medicine care, and as a result I have experienced significant improvement of my Menieres. When solutions were running out from \"traditional\" medical physicians, a friend suggested that I try seeing what na turopathic medicine could do. I never had such a thorough initial questionnaire about my health and ev aluation by a physician until I met Dr. Steelsmith. In dealing with my Menieres that thankfully comes and goes for pe riods at a time, Dr. Steelsmith has helped me improved through diet, accupuncture and natural herbal medicine. I wa s fortunate that I was in a position to pay for all the expenses. However, there are so many other people that need th is type of medical care, but can't afford it. Your support of this bill will allow them to get the help they need.

Ige and Rosalyn H. Baker, I am writing to you in support of SB 420 SD1 Relating to Naturopathic Medicine. I am a licensed naturopathic doctor and I have been in practice for 15 years in the state of Hawaii. I also hold a Washington state license as a naturopathic physician. It is time to update out naturopathic law in the state of Hawaii so that naturopathic physicians can better serve their patients. In Hawaii I practice with my hands tied behind my back because our law does not allow us to practice within the full scope of our training. In contrast, in Washington State I have the ability to prescribe numerous prescription only pharmaceuticals, and I am allowed to administer intramuscular, subcutaneous and intravenous therapies. I do work closely medical doctors here in Hawaii however, they are often so busy that my patients have difficulty getting in to see them. With the modernization of our law, naturopathic doctors will be able to better serve the people of Hawaii. Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing of the passing of this bill.

Ige, and other Members of the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection, I am a Hawaii resident writing to strongly urge your support of Measure S.B. No. 420, S.D.1 as it relates to naturopathic medicine. As a Hawaii li censed psychologist who works extensiv ely with people who have related health and mental health issues, I ha ve worked with Dr. Laurie Steelsmith and other naturopaths, and I have consistently found that my patients ha ve improved not only in their health but also in their ability to take responsibility for their overal l health. Personally, as a patient of Dr . Steelsmith, I have found her to be very knowledgeable, caring, respectful and edu cational, all qualities which contri bute to the health and healing of patients. Naturopathic physicians have extensiv e medical training at na turopathic medical schools, yet in Hawaii they have minimal insurance coverage and are unable to practice their full scope of medical skills. It is time to modernize the Hawaii State naturopathic law, which ha s not been revised in 20 y ears. Measure S.B. No. 420, S.D.1 will give Dr. Steelsmith and other naturopathic doc tors in Hawaii a greater scope of practice that will enable them to more effectively se rve all the people of our state. I have also spoken at length with Dr. Sarah Strong lo cated in Puna, who offers general primary care but cannot accept insurance. There are many people who would benef it frrom her services but who cannot afford them. Practitioners such as Dr. Strong who practice in rural areas would be able to contribute much more to the health of the people in their area if they were able to pr actice to the full scope of th eir training. As general practitioners who are licensed in Hawa ii as primary care physici ans, naturopathic physici ans are an invaluable part of our healthcar e system. Other types of doctors are overwhe lmed with the current demand, often making it difficult for patients to receive even basic medical care. Further, as you ma y well be aware of, many doctors are now refusing to accept patients who have Medicaid, furthe r reducing the availability of healthcare for this population. Allowing naturopathic phys icians to practice according to thei r training will greatly increase the availability and quality of healthcare av ailable to the people of this state. Furthermore, given that naturopathic physicians are most highly trained in preventive medicine, they are uniquely qualified to promote a healthier Hawai'i while de creasing the long-term financ ial burden of healthcare costs.

To: Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Prot ection, Committee Chair Senator Rosalyn H. Baker and the Vice Chair Senator David Y. Ige Re: SB420SD1 Relating to Naturopathic Medicine My name is Dr. Nathan Ehrlich, N.D. I am a naturopa thic physician with a practi ce in upcountry Maui since 1989. I received my pre-medical bachelor of science degree in psychobiology from Albright College in 1984 and received my Naturopathic Doctorate from National Co llege of Naturopathic Medi cine in Portland, OR in 1988. I have been a member of the Hawaii Society of Naturopathic Physicians since 1989 for which I have also served as an officer in several capacities over th e years. I also have been a member of the American Association of Naturopathic P hysicians since 1989 as well. I ask for your support of SB420 for the following reasons: The field of naturopathic medicine, along with medicine and healthcare in general, is evolving rapidly. The wisdom of tr aditional medicine is being coupled with the advancement of research and technology a nd we, as naturopathic physicians, as the foremost authorities on natural medicine, have the responsibility of being in step with th is process. It is time for the law governing naturopathic medicine in Hawaii to be moderni zed to permit N.D.'s to pr actice as educated in the curricula of accredited natur opathic medical schools. One aspect of naturopathic practice wh ich is directly impacted by this bill is the ability for N.D.'s to perform parenteral therapy (administration of medicine via inje ction). Natural medicines administered by injection are an important part of naturopathic pr actice and are not a service customarily supplied by conventional health care providers. There is a history of safe administration of injectio n therapy for naturopathic physicians in the state of Hawaii, and we are, as naturopathic physicians, the mo st trained practitioners in nutrition and, as such, are the providers most able to perform this therapy. Ther e is currently a healthcare cr isis on a national level which can be aided by the full integration of naturopathic physic ians into a complementary model of healthcare which allows for overlap among healthcare professions. As certain procedures within a profession are also administered by trained and qualified pr acitioners from other professions, the public is more effectively served. Thank you for your consideration of this bill. Please support its passage. 2 Nathan Ehrlich, N.D. 1Eric Arquero From: noreencon@aol.com Sent: February 2009 RE: Support of Measure S.B.

Although trained and licensed as primary care physicians, with all the liability and responsibility pertaining to this occupation, we do not have the benefit of being able to perform many of the services that our schooling trained us for - pharmaceutical prescriptions (such as antib iotics), injection and IV therapies, and minor surgery. The title \"naturopathic physician\" is rewarded only after eight years of rigorous higher education, internships and four days of extensive testing through national board exams. Many other states hav e modernized their laws to keep up with the changes in education of naturopathic doctors that have occurred over the past 20 years. It is only in the best interest of the state of Hawai'i to do the same. The passing of this bill would allow over 100 phys icians throughout the islands to be able to better treat their patients and to eliminate unnecessary referrals. Many other physicians are not even able to accept new patients at this time due to the overwhelming need for healthcare. In my opinion, naturopathic physicians offer a solution to a number of problems in our healthcare system. While alleviating an extra burden from other physicians, we also are focusing on the prevention of disease, which helps minimize future healthcare costs. Please allow us to help in a manner that we are trained and willing to do. Aloha, Dr Sarah Strong, ND Strong Medicine, Gentle Healing Powers 15-3244 10:27 AM To: CPN Testimony Subject: Support of Measure S.B. #420 Dear Senator Rosalyn Bake r and Senator David Ige, I am writing to ask your support of Measure S.B. #420, relating to naturopathic medicine in Hawaii. I am a patient of Dr. Laurie Steelsmith, and understand that she would be better able to serve her patients if this measure were passed. Pam Chambers 360 Anonia St. Honolulu, HI 96821 ---- Pam Chambers 1Eric Arquero Subject: Fw: SB420 SD1 Relating to Naturopathic Medicine There is no reason that I can see for this bill to not be passed. I have closely follo wed the scope of practice in other states where Doctors are actually allowed to treat their patients and it is a beautiful thing. Hawaii is in desperate need of healthcare and we are at the same time telling doctors that they ar e not allowed to proscribe antibiotics, bio-identical hormones, and other pharm aceuticals. Naturopathic doctors are trained in pharmacology to a greater extent than most MD allopaths. It is not a question of weather or not they are qualified to proscribe medicine it is only a question why we won't let them . We have urgent care clinics running without any doctor. We allow physicians assistants to proscribe meds but not Naturopathic doctors. That is how absurd this situation has gotten. As a tax payer and lifetime island resident I demand that we pass this bill and help hawaii doctors heal our health care crisis. Patrick Nelson (808) 728-8463 1Eric Subject: S.B.

Sincerely yours, Sarah Johnson 2/28/09 1Eric Arquero CPN Testimony Subject: SB420 Relating to Naturopathic Medicine, March 3 2009, 9:30am, Conference room 229 THE SENATE THE TWENTYFIFTH LEGISLATURE REGULAR SESSION OF 2009 To: Consumer Protection Committee, Sen. Rosalyn Baker, Chair, Sen. David Ige, Vice Chair Re: SB420 Relating to Naturopathic Medicine, March 3 2009, 9:30am, Conference room 229 Aloha Chair Baker, Vice Chair Ige and Committee members, I am writing out of my wish to be a part of the solution to healthcare crisis in Hawaii Nei. I have been a resident of Hawaii since 1996. In 2001, I left to attend medical school on the mainland, and finished my residency last year. I have returned to South Kona and intend to practice in this community. I am the sole physician for 15 miles in one direction and 25 miles in the other. As a naturopathic physician, I was trained as a primary care doctor. My education was comprised of two (2) years of science didactics and three (3) years of clinical training. This included 60 hours of coursework in medical procedures such as superficial wound closure, intramuscular injections and intravenous therapies. In addition were 50 hours of coursework pharmacology. This training is on par with my allopathic counterparts. In order to fully care for my patients as a primary care physician, Hawaii's naturopathic medicine law needs updating. Currently, when my patients need a prescription drug, injectio ns or vaccinations, or stitches for superficial cuts, I refer them out to another medical practitioner. This not only adds an extra expense for the patient, but also valuable time while waiting to recieve an appointment in an already overburdened system. The steps toward modernization in SB420 will help to ease the burden on our over stretched healthcare practitioners, allow access to more primary care providers, and support a philosophy of illness prevention, translating into increased quality of life, and ultimately cost savings. I am asking on behalf of myself and the patients in my community to support the current legislation SB420. It would make a measurable difference in the quality and breadth of care I am able to give my patients in our underserved area of Hawaii. I am asking for your support of Senate Bill 420.

From: Subject: SB 420 , SD1, Relating to Naturopathic Medicine TO : The Honorable Rosalyn H Baker, Chair The Honorable David Y Ige, Vice Chair Honorable Committee Members NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE- MODERNIZATION BILL March 1st, 2009 SENATE COMMERCE AND CONSUMER PROTECTION HEARING TUESDAY, MARCH 3, 2009 at 9:30 AM , Conference Room 229 DEAR SENATORS BAKER, IGE AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I am Dr Steve Dubey, Hawaii licensed Naturopathic P hysician and Acupuncturist, pr acticing 28 years, and an active member of the Hawaii Society of Naturopathic Physicians. I write to you today in favor of pa ssage of SB 420. I am in full support of the testimony from our association, presented to you by our repres entative, Dr Kevin Gibson. This bill simply puts the definition and practice of Naturopathic Medicine in Hawaii at a comparable level with the rest of our profession in North America. I live and practice on the island of Kauai. I have run a busy clinic in Lihue since 1981. My staff and I offer family health care , with an emphasis on musculo-skel etal therapies and modalities, Naturopathic Medicines including medicinal herbs, nutrition, life style counseling, and preventa tive patient education. I have now treated members of our community from the newborn to the elderly , with nearly every simple and complex health diagnosis listed in Dorland' s Medical Dictionary. I have enjoyed a close working relationship with MD and DO colleagues, in both giving and receiving refe rrals. Patient care is obviously enhanced by the complementary and multi-disciplinary care that is often seen in modern health care today, and as practiced in Lihue, Kauai. From 1996 to 2004 I served on the Naturopathic Board of Examiners, and finished my last term as Chairperson. Hawaii Revised Statute Chapter 455 , which lic enses Naturopathic Doctors in our state, was first put into law in 1926 , before Hawaii attained statehood. Much of the origin al language is still in the statute. On numerous occasions, during my term on the Boar d, it was obvious that our statute had simply become outdated. Our antiquated Statute , and the lim ited practice it allows, has turned away Hawaii born ND practitioners because Hawaii has come to be known as a \" Backward s State\"- a state where graduates from Naturopathic schools can not practice to th e full extent of their trai ning. Modern Naturopathic tr aining prepares the Doctors of today as Primary Health Care providers with a speci alty in practical, evidence based Natural Health Care. 2 I don't have to go into specifics of how Medical Scien ce, Technology and Heatlh Care in general has changed over the last 80+ years. Appropriately, Naturopathic Medicine , as taught in the accredited edu cational institutions that train Naturopathic Physicians, has changed as well, embracing advances in diagnostics, nu tritional biochemistry , botanical/nutriceutical therapies, and other areas of advancement. Thank you for your consideration and assistance in put ting Hawaii's Naturopathic Physicians' scope and definition of practice at a level with the rest of our profession throughout the contin ental United States, Alaska, and Canada. Yours Sincerely Steven Dubey ND LAc Natural Health Clinic HI 96707 March 1 , Subject: Support of Measure S.B.

No. 420, S.D.1 as it relates to naturopathic medicine. As a naturopathic medicine patient, I have personally benefited from naturopathic medical care that has significantly improved my health with treatment that \"Western\" medical praticiners never c onsider and aren't equipment to implement . I have literally gone through numerous board certified doctors who tell me they do not have time to help me, every symptom is imageary or worse. It wasn't until I went a naturopathi c professional that I began making progress and I am significantly better today. Naturopathic physicians have extensiv e medical training at na turopathic medical schools, yet in Hawaii they have minimal insurance coverage and are unable to practice their full scope of medical skills.

In a stat e where medical help can be hard to find, I am so happy that Dr Sarah Strong (N D) was willing to see me when all other private physicians in Hilo area would not. Naturopaths are trained far beyond their curre nt usage in Hawaii. Delivering babies, minor surgeries, and treatment with herbs rather th an pharmaceuticals should all be included. Instead, they are currently very limited by th e state law.........not by know ledge or experience. We need to attract more medical providers to Hawaii, not fewer. Please make changes necessary to expand scope of care for NDs to increase the care available. It is paramount, when ill, to see someone trained in the medical field, and to have a legal block to some of the best do cs around is counter productive.

Baker, David Y. Ige, and other Members of th e Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection, As a Hawaii resident, a concerned citizen, and a Professor of English at the Universi ty of Hawaii, Manoa, I am writing to strongly urge your support of bill SB 420 SD1 as it relates to naturopathic medicine. I have been a patient of Dr. Laurie Steelsmith's for over 14 years, and I have significantly improved h ealth as a result of being in her care. I am a better teacher and researcher and have a fuller life becaus e of her expertise. I can even say that Dr. Steelsmith's medical care has been more importa nt to me over this time period than any of the MDs whom I have consulted and whose servic es have been covered by insurance. Ho wever, it is best not to have to choose between NDs and MDs but to be able to consult bo th as they are appropriate to one's condition. Hawai'i needs insurance coverage for naturopa thic doctors: their success with ma ny patients here has earned it, and we all deserve it for the increased health of Hawai'i'speople. Naturopathic physicians have extensiv e medical training at na turopathic medical schools, yet in Hawaii they have minimal insurance coverage and are unable to practice their full scope of medical skills. It is time to modernize the Hawaii State naturopathic law, which ha s not been revised in 20 years. Bill SB 420 SD1 will give Dr. Steelsmith and other naturopathic doctors in Hawa ii a greater scope of practi ce that will enable them to more effectively serve all th e people of our state. Given the current state of the economy, many physicians are leaving our state. As general practitioners who are licensed in Hawaii as primary care physic ians, naturopathic physicians are an invaluable part of our healthcare system. Other types of doctors are overwhelmed with th e current demand, often making it difficult for patients to receive even basic medical care. Allowing naturopathic physicians to practice according to their training will greatly increase the quality of healthcare av ailable to the citizens of this state. Since naturopathic physicians are most highly trained in preventive medicine , they are also uniquely qualified to promote a healthier Hawai'i while decr easing the long-term financial burden of healthcare costs.

I look forward to hearing of the passing of this bill. Sincerely yours, Vicki Sakoda 2 1Eric Arquero Papai St. Honolulu, HI. 96821 February 28, 2009 Dear Senators Baker and Ige, I am writing in support of SB 420 SD 1 and respectively request your cons ideration of this bill. In the wake of our national healthcare environment it is of the utmost importance th at citizens of Hawaii have the opportunity to seek preventative healthcare advisors such as Naturopathic physicians. Naturopathy encourages individuals to be responsible for their own health and to take a proactive position in approach to healthcare. We are seeing pr ohibitive increases in standard health care and very well may see many diagnostic opportunities evaporate with the proposed national healthcare system, thus there will be an urgent need for well trained, licens ed Naturopathic doctors. Properly educated Naturopaths have extensive medical training received at naturopathic medical schools, however, in the state of Hawaii they ar e afforded only minimal insurance coverage and are not allowed to practice to their highest and best potential. In supporting SB 420 SD1, you would be raising t he bar for naturopathic medical treatment and bringing the State of Ha waii up to par with some of the most advanced states in our nation. It is Hawaii's time to recognize the sophisticated care that a naturopath offers to his/her patients in treating \"the whole patient\" as opposed to those w ho specialize in one area and offer a patient no more than a 20 minute office vi sit and a prescription. A good nat uropath spends time with their patient, building a profile of patient needs and addre ssing those needs in a met hodical approach, it is an approach that all medical schools should adopt. In addition, if a patient needs a medication they are given either a bioidentical me dicine or a well thought out health plan to approach their condition. The passing of this bill would allow all patient s to receive full service medical treatment. Again, as a concerned citizen of Honolulu I ask that you both support and pass this bill, it can only offer, yet another option, for people from the Paci fic Rim area to come to Hawaii for sophisticated medical treatment and it would allow the people of Hawaii to receive the consistent quality of healthcare that they deserve. We will follow the progression of this bill with keen interest. Respectfully submitted, Wendy B. Crabb Get a jump start on your taxes.

Baker, C hair Honorable Senator David Y. Ige, Vice Chair and other Members of the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection. I am Dr. Darrow Hand, a licensed naturopathic physician in the State of Hawai 'i, and I am writing to strongly urge your suppor t of Measure S.B. No. 420, S.D.1 as it relates to naturopathic medicine. Given that naturopathic physicians are highly trained in preventive medicine, we are uniquely qualified to promote a healthier Hawai'i while decreasing the long -term financial burden of health care costs. SB 420 SD 1 would update the definition and scope of practice of naturopathic medicine to be comparable to that found in other states such as Washington and Oregon . Naturopathic physicians receive extensive training at naturopathic medical schools. This legislation would allow us to practice medicine as we are trained, and enable us to more effectively serve the people of Hawai'i. Naturopathic physicians are a valuable part of our healthcare system. It is time to modernize the naturopathic law in Hawai'i, which has not been revised for many years. Naturopathic physicians provide a valuable service to public h ealth and safety . Giving the Naturopathic Board the authority to deter mine the naturopathic formulary will provide necessary safeguards for the public. Thank you for the opportunity to testify to this matter. Sincerely yours, Darrow Hand "}
