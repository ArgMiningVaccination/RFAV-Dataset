Since then, I have been very impressed by her holistic approach that takes into consideration, not just a particular condition, but all aspects of an individual's physical and mental health. Her advice to me on diet, supplements, exercise, and stress management has all been helpful and illuminating. I came to Dr. Kuzniar because I was getting frequent UTI's. I went to a few doctors, one of them being a urologist, and they all suggested that I go on a small dose of medication for life to prevent getting them. Dr. Kuzniar sat with me for 2 hours and very patiently listened to my history from begining to end. She then suggested a few natural remedies to help get rid of this problem. Behold, 3 months have gone by and my UTI's have not come back since. I was really very pleased with my expirience with Dr. Kuzniar. Before working with Dr. Kuzniar, I had been considering working with a naturopathic doctor for some time. I had chronic digestive issues and difficult seasonal allergies, and I wanted to move away from taking pharmaceutical medications to manage my symptoms. I was a bit nervous before the first appointment, as I really didn't know what to expect. Dr. Kuzniar warmly greeted me and put me immediately at ease. Our first meeting included a very comprehensive health history. I had never had this kind of experience with a healthcare professional before, and I felt a great sense of relief that someone was taking the time to sit with me, really listen to me, and was determined to help me uncover the root causes of my health issues. I have been Dr. Kuzniar's patient for a few years now, and in addition to my initial goals, she has helped me with stress management, maintaining my health in times of crisis, and making sure my nutrition and exercise plan are on target for my unique needs. Dr. Kuzniar is extremely knowledgeable, passionate about evaluating clinical research to help find solutions for her clients, and welcomes my desire and commitment to be an active participant in managing my own health. I consider Dr. Kuzniar to be my primary doctor, and reach out to her first when I have any personal health concerns. I visited Dr Kuzniar 15 lbs over weight, high blood pressure, and always tired. After a few months working with Dr. Kuzniar I lost 10 lbs, dropped my blood pressure significantly, and achieved new levels of vitality. Dr. Kuzniar also helped my 2 year old daughter heal herself from chronic ear infections and eczema. My family considers her our go to doctor for true health and wellbeing. . I have been treating with Dr. Kuzniar for the past 7 years or so, and I honestly could not speak more highly of her and of my experience as her patient. No only is she extremely knowledgeable, but she is like those doctors that no longer exist that actually go \"beyond the call of duty\" to help out. On several occasions she has been there for me in a crisis situation offering me advice via email. She is truly a rare gem that I totally cherish and am very grateful for. Dr. Kuzniar was a guest speaker discussing Sugar Addiction at one of our Holistic Moms Network meetings. She was very thorough, informative, accessible, engaging, and willing and able to answer all of our questions. We left with knowledge and tools to use for ourselves and our families. As a patient of Dr. Kuzniar I have been very happy with the care she has provided. She has worked with me, step by step, to figure out what is causing my issues and has provided me with dietary advice along with supplements and stress management guidance . It has been so refreshing to have a practitioner encouraging me to share the full picture of my physical and mental health, and lifestyle, in order to best provide treatment and recommendations. When I made my first appointment with Dr. Kuzniar back in 2013, I had been getting 5-6 sinus infections per year, for several years! My doctor would prescribe dose after dose of antibiotics and I was scared for my health. I always asked my doctor why I kept getting these infections, but he never had any answers. I tried reading articles online, but there was just so much information out there, I just didn't know what to believe. I was at wits end when my husband convinced me to find a naturopath. That's when I found Dr. Kuzniar. At my first visit, she spent 2 hours pouring over my medical records and asked me lots of questions, but most importantly, she listened to me. It was the first time in my life that I knew that I was in good hands. You can tell when someone really cares about your health and she does. Dr. Kuzniar suggested a few dietary changes and recommended some supplements. This was was 4 year years ago and I can count on one hand how many sinus infections I've had since then. Now, I check in with her every 3 months, for health tune ups and advice about any issues I'm having. She helped me through my pregnancy and she's given me some fantastic advice for my baby too. If you're on the fence about seeing Dr. Kuzniar, please, just go. I promise that you will be glad you did! \"Intuitive & Inspired.\" These are the words I would use to describe Dr. Leat Kuzniar. As a Broadway actress and mother of three, I lead a pretty stressful life. Dr Kuzniar has put me on the path to physical & mental wellness, giving me the tools to manage my stressful life and also has treated my recurring skin issues utilizing a holistic approach of diet, stress control and vitamin supplements. Dr. Kuzniar doesn't just treat your symptoms but investigates the WHOLE you and the reasons behind your ailments. She truly cares about her patients and has the most gentle, nurturing approach. If you are tired of conventional medicine not treating your ailments, please don't waste another moment & call Dr. Kuzniar. Through her guidance, counsel, and care, I have truly have added years to my "}
