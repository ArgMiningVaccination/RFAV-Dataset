New Technology Application? No. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Approval? No. The VasQ External Support device (Laminate Medical, Ltd) was granted Breakthrough Device Designation in June 2020 for use as an external support for autolog ous vascular conduits created by means of vascular surgery. The requestor anticipates FDA approval in December 2022. Background : Vascular access complications are experienced by the majority of end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on hemodialysis, r esulting in a high rate of hospitalization and morbidity. Appropriate care of hemodialysis patients requires constant attention to the maintenance of vascular access patency and function. An ideal access delivers a flow rate to the dialyzer adequate for the dialysis prescription, has a long use -life, and has a low rate of complications (e.g., infection, stenosis, thrombosis, aneurysm, repeat interventions, and limb ischemia). Of the currently available vascular access options, the surgically created fist ula is the gold standard as it most closely meets the standards of a n ideal vascular access , with the lowest relative complication rate. However, approximately half of all AV fistulas still require an additional procedure or are abandoned within the first six months of creation . The AV fistula is created by suturing together an artery and a vein, usually in the arm below the elbow (brachio -cephalic) or above the wrist (radio -cephalic) and allowing arterial pressure to enlarge the vein to accommodate a la rge needle. To be used for dialysis, a newly created fistula must maintain patency and mature; that is, the artery and vein must undergo dilation and remodeling to accommodate the markedly increased blood flow that results from creating the AV anastomosis . The process of maturation occurs within the first one to six months and often requires additional procedures (e.g. balloon angioplasty , surgical revision, etc.) to assist the venous remodeling. Some veins are too deep to be adequately punctured with a dialysis needle and are subsequently transposed to a more superficial position during creation. Studies have demonstrate d that native AV fistulas have the best 4 to 5 year patency rates and require the fewest interventions compared with other access types . However, despite the clear benefits of native arteriovenous (AV) fistulas over other access methods, early failure occurs in over 40% of these fistulas. Most of these failures occur in the peri -anastomotic region that has been mobilized from its native surrounding tissue and left without extraluminal support. The unsupported vein can undergo significant geometric changes post -surgery that result in poor hemodynamics and negative remodeling ultimate ly resulting in fistula failure. According to the requestor, no FDA cleared technologies exist to address the underlying failure mechanisms at the point of fistula creation. Technology The VasQ External Support device (VasQ) is a nitinol implant which incorporates a conical braided wire portion that fits a round the vein, welded to a laser cut brace that fits over the artery at 15 the anastomosis. The extraluminal support was designed to retain the ideal anastomotic geometry for optimized hemodynamics and remodeling into a functional fistula. The VasQ is ava ilable in 6 dimensions in an effort to comply with vessel diameters and ensure optimal fit with the fistula. An accessory to the VasQ External Support device is the dedicated Selection Tool, which is used during the procedure to gauge the artery diameter and select the best fitting VasQ dimension . Procedure Description The VasQ is implanted by the vascular surgeon during the AV fistula creation procedure. Two surgical fistula creation procedures currently exist for which VasQ may be indicated for u se: 1) Cimino type fistula and 2) Transpositions . Cimino type fistulas describe the direct connection of a vein to an artery for the purposes of facilitating hemodialysis. Transpositions similarly describe a direct connection but also add a mobilization of the entire vein to move it to a more superficial position to help facilitate needle access for hemodialysis. Below briefly describes the additional steps required to implant VasQ during either AV fistula creation procedure: Cimino type fistula: The subcutaneous tissue is carefully dissected until the artery and vein are located. The artery is measured with a designated sizing tool to select the appropriate external support device size. The device is moved proximally on the vein away from the disse cted end and held in that position with a vascular clamp to prevent interfere nce with the suturing of the anastomosis. A single suture is threaded within the eyelets of the device and under the artery. The two eyelets are sutured together under the arter y to hold the device in place without constrict ing the artery. Transpositions: An incision is made into the skin over the cephalic , basilic , or forearm vein from the elbow toward the shoulder for a distance long enough to accomplish the transposition. The artery is measured with a designated sizing tool to select the appropriate external support device size. After the transposition is performed, the device is placed on the vein in preparation for the anastomosis to be created. The device is moved proxi mally on the vein away from the dissected end and held in that position with a vascular clamp to prevent interfere nce with the suturing of the anastomosis. A single suture is threaded within the eyelets of the device and under the artery. The two eyelets are sutured together under the artery to hold the device in place without constrict ing the artery. Current Coding: There are no unique ICD -10-PCS codes to describe implantation of an extraluminal support device during AV fistula creation. Facilities c an report the procedure using the device value J Synthetic Substitute and the appropriate body part value from the table below . The Bypass procedure performed to create the AV fistula would be coded separately.

New Technology Application? Yes. The requestor intends to submit a New Technology Add - on Payment (NTAP) application for FY 2024 consideration. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Approval ? Yes. The Longeviti ClearFit\u00ae OTS (off -the- shelf) Cranial Implant (Longeviti Neuro Solutions, LLC) manufactured to correct and/or restore bony voids and/or defects of the cranium received 510(k) clearance on September 8, C learFit\u00ae Cranial Implant (Longeviti Neuro Solutions, LLC) designed and manufactured individually for each patient to correct bony voids and/or defects in the adult cranium with acoustically transparent properties received 510(k) clearance on December 16, 2 020 (K203349). Background: Cranial reconstruction procedures are generally performed following open brain surgery for a number of conditions including brain tumor resection, hydrocephalus shunt implantation, cerebral aneurysm clipping, evacuation of ain hemorrhage, microvascular decompression, lobectomy, and more , that require removing a portion of the skull. The resulting cranial defect may be subsequently reconstructed by either replacing the portion of the skull that was removed and fastening it w ith fixation devices (e.g. plates and screws) , or by applying a cranial prosthetic device to address the bony void and/or defect. In addition to protecting the brain, t he skull also acts as a barrier to sound and prevents using sonography for post -operati ve imaging. Currently, post -operative imaging for neurosurgical patients is limited to computed tomography ( CT) and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) which are currently the standard of care. However, the requestor reported that CT and MRI usually require patient transport during the inpatient recovery period which can be risky, and CT also exposes patients to ionizing radiation. Following discharge , most neurosurgical pathologies also require periodic CT or MRI follow -up scans. According to the requesto r, the logistical effort and other considerations limit the quantity of imaging studies that can be reasonably performed on a patient. Avoiding additional radiation exposure and enabling the use of bedside, real time imaging would also be beneficial to th e patient. The Longeviti ClearFit\u00ae Cranial Implant and the Longeviti ClearFit\u00ae OTS Cranial Implant have lower attenuation than skull bone and therefore enable sonography: Trans -Cranioplasty Ultrasound (TCUS) . According to the requestor, TCUS does not req uire patient transport since the devices are mobile. The availability of point of care ultrasound may also reduce the need to obtain follow -up CT or MRI imaging. A ccording to the requestor, as an adjunct screening tool , neurosurgical imaging with TCUS ma y, for example, identify a tumor recurrence after surgical resection weeks or months in advance of the next scheduled CT or MRI. Technology Both the customized Longeviti ClearFit\u00ae Cranial Implant s and the Longeviti ClearFit\u00ae OTS Cranial Implants product s are manufactured from polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) materials and can be fixated to cranial bone using commercially available fasteners. 19 The Longeviti ClearFit\u00ae Cranial Implant s are customized prosthetic cranioplasty using the patient's p re-operative computed tomography (CT) scan data. The implants are designed to either : 1) Fill an existing cranial defect that is present in the CT or 2) Restore bone in a predicted area where the skull will be removed (\"single stage \" procedure ). Customiz ed ClearFit\u00ae devices are delivered sterile, their design is approved by the surgeon, and they take approximately 10 business days to manufacture from receipt of the scan. Customized ClearFit\u00ae devices are \"made to order\" . The Cranial Implants are fixed -size prosthetic cranioplasty plates and come in common universal sizes and shapes. They are manufactured at scale , delivered sterile, and readily available for the surgeon at the time of surgery . ClearFit\u00ae OTS devices are not \"made to order\". The Longeviti ClearFit\u00ae Cranial Implant s and the Longeviti ClearFit\u00ae OTS Cranial Implants products are available in two device options: 1) ClearFit\u00ae Disc and 2) ClearFit\u00ae Cover . The ClearFit\u00ae Disc implants can be curved or flat to f it the shape of the skull , are intended to restore cranial bone voids and allow for the use of ultrasound after surgery. The ClearFit\u00ae Cover implants are designed to be low -profile while also allowing for visualization with ultrasound after surgery. Acco rding to the requestor, t he implants aim to restore the natural contours of the skull while maintaining the required functionality of such a device, including the required mechanical properties and ease of visualization of the underlying tissue. The atten uation of the ClearFit\u00ae device enables ultrasound imaging. Note: The InvisiShunt\u00ae is also a Longeviti product used in cranioplasty procedures and provides a lower profile shunt to allow for a significant difference in projection, typically in hydrocephalu s management . That product is not included for purposes of the code request related to ClearFit\u00ae Cranial Implant s and the Longeviti ClearFit\u00ae OTS Cranial Implants . Procedure Description After the principal neurosurgical procedure has been performed , the selected ClearFit\u00ae device is implanted intra -operatively during \"closing\" or reconstructing the dura, skull, and scalp. The ClearFit \u00ae device typically replace s the bone that was removed at the beginning of the procedure to access the brain, replaces par t of that bone, or replaces the titanium fasteners that are used to secure the skull flap to the native cranium. Post -operatively , the attenuation of the ClearFit\u00ae device enables ultrasound imaging approximately 24 -48 hours post procedure, after swelling has subsided. Current Coding: There are no unique ICD -10-PCS codes to describe implantation of an ultrasound penetrable cranioplasty plate. Facilities can report the procedure using the device value J Synthetic Substitute and the skull body part value f rom the table below . The post -operative trans - cranioplasty ultrasound (TCUS) would be reported separately with an appropriate code from the Imaging section.

New Technology Application? Yes. The reque stor intends to submit a New Technology Add - on Payment (NTAP) application for FY 2024 consideration. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Approval? No. The TricValve\u00ae Transcatheter Bicaval Valve System was granted Breakthrough Device Designation on Decemb er 15, 2020 for treatment of severe tricuspid regurgitation. Background: Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a condition that occurs as a consequence of malcoaptation of the tricuspid valve leaflets. This results in retrograde blood flow to the right atrium and subsequent loss of forward flow into the right ventricle. TR can cause dyspnea, hepatic congestion, ascites and edema; however, clinical sequelae may not present until TR progresses in severity. TR is usually present in patients with comorbid condi tions such as: pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, mitral valve disease, or in patients with implanted cardiac devices1. Severity of TR is graded as mild, moderate or severe under echocardiography2. It is estimated that approxim ately 1.6 million people in the US have been diagnosed with moderate to severe TR and therapies for management of severe TR are limited3,4. Current therapies consist of drug therapy and surgery. Diuretic therapy can treat systemic congestion in patients with severe symptomatic TR3. In patients with dilation of the tricuspid valve annulus, pulmonary vasomodulators may help reduce right ventricle overload in patients with pulmonary hypertension. According to t he requestor, d rug therapy may improve the symptoms but not the underlying condition in severe TR. These patients are quite sick and have a 3- and 5 -year survival rate of 27% and 19% respectively5. In patients with signs and symptoms of right sided heart failure and TR attributable to malcoaptation of the tricuspid leaflets and who are poorly responsive to medical therapy, tricuspid valve surgery can be beneficial to reduce symptoms. However, tricuspid valve surgery when indicated has an operative mortal ity of 10.9%6,7. Patients diagnosed with severe symptomatic TR for which there are no other treatment options due to the 1 Bhave NM, Ward RP. Echocardiographic assessment and Bonow RO, al.

These patients are commonly not eligible for open surgery. Technology The TricValve\u00ae Transcatheter Bicaval Valve System is a bicaval transcatheter implantation system, which includes the TricValve\u00ae Transcatheter Bicaval Valve for heteroto pic placement of a Superior Vena Cava (SVC) valve and for an Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) valve. These heterotopic valves are intended to replace the function of the defective regurgitant tricuspid valve. The TricValve\u00ae Transcatheter Bicaval Valves are already pre-mounted into the TricValve\u00ae Delivery System. The bioprosthesis consists of a tubular metallic structure of nitinol which is self - expandable and radiopaque with three valve leaflets of bovine pericardium sutured and complemented by a skirt of polyeste r to avoid paravalvular leaks. The bioprosthesis leaflets are processed with anti -calcification treatment as well as chemical dehydration. It is available in two different diameters for each model (SVC and IVC) specifically designed to adapt to the anato mic features of the superior and inferior vena cava. The 25mm valve is used for SVC sizes ranging from 21mm to 31mm and the 29mm valve is used for IVC sizes ranging from 27mm to 34mm both with a frame height of 65mm at a relaxed state. The TricValve\u00ae Delivery System catheter is an enclosure retraction type system and used to deploy the bioprosthesis. It has anchors in its system for safe and accurate bioprosthesis valve deployment. The distal end of the system has an atraumatic radiopaque tip and protec tive sheath. A capsule at the distal end covers and maintains the bioprosthesis in a crimped position. A stabilizer tube is fixed at the handle and extends outside the catheter shaft. It provides a barrier between the inner catheter shaft and vessel wall s, thus enabling the catheter to retract freely. The delivery system is compatible with 0.889 mm (0.035 inch) guide wire. The handle includes a macro slider for opening and closing the bioprosthesis housing and a micro adjusting knob to facilitate accura te release of the bioprosthesis. The micro knob rotates clockwise to open the housing and in anticlockwise direction for close the capsule. The delivery system has a flush port which is used to hydrate the bioprosthesis leaflets and remove air before usa ge. Procedure Description The left and right femoral veins are accessed percutaneously and a 6 Fr. introducer sheath is inserted into each vein. A pulmonary catheter is placed via the left femoral vein access through the sheath in the right pulmonary a rtery to mark the crossing of the right pulmonary artery with the SVC. A 6 Fr pigtail catheter is introduced in the right femoral vein and an angiogram of the SVC is obtained. The pigtail catheter is then exchanged for a straight 0.036 inch stiff guidewi re with a soft tip. The SVC valve (bioprosthesis) is hydrated and the delivery system is advanced over the guidewire through the right femoral vein and the IVC into the right atrium and the SVC. The upper part of the SVC valve is placed in the confluence o f the brachiocephalic veins (where they converge to form the SVC) with the belly of the SVC valve positioned above the right pulmonary artery crossing. The valve position is confirmed under fluoroscopic and echocardiographic visualization. Once confirmati on is made, the upper most 20 mm of the valve is partially deployed and full deployment is then made by unsheathing the bioprosthesis using the delivery system. The 8 TricValve FDA pivotal clinical trial protocol. TricVa lve v.1.0 _10NOV2021. 23 IVC delivery system and bioprosthesis are properly hydrated and loaded over the guidewire at the right puncture site. The IVC bioprosthesis is positioned at the height of the diaphragm with the skirt of the bioprosthesis visible just above the hepatic vein inflow. The IVC bioprosthesis is then deployed using the delivery system. Post deployme nt of both the SVC and IVC bioprostheses, all catheters and introducer sheaths are removed and the access site is closed per hospital protocol. Administration of anticoagulation and/or antiplatelet therapy is administered intraprocedurally. Current Coding : There are no unique ICD -10-PCS codes to describe the insertion of transcatheter bioprosthetic valves in the IVC and SVC. Facilities can report the procedures performed using the device value D Intraluminal Device and the appropriate body part values V, Superior Vena Cava and 0, Inferior Vena Cava from the tables below .

The ICD -10-PCS code request application can be accessed at: https://mearis.cms.gov . We encouraged users to register and begin using this system to provide feedback on their experience with this initial version. Effective March 1, 2022, the full release of MEARIS became active for ICD -10-PCS code request submissions. CMS will only accept ICD -10-PCS code request applications submitted via MEARIS. Requests submitted through the ICDProcedureCodeRequest mailbox will no longer be considered. Within MEARIS, we have built in several resources to support requestors: Please refer to the \"Resources\" section for guidance regarding the request submission process at: https://mearis.cms.gov/public/resources . Technical support is available under \"Useful Links\" at the bottom of the MEARIS site Request related questions can be submitted to CMS using the form available under \"Contact\" at: https://mearis.cms.gov/public/resources?app=icd -10-pcs The time required for application request submission, including the time needed to gather relevant information as well as to complete the form may be extensive depend ing on the nature of the code request. Requestors are, therefore, encouraged to start in advance of the due date to ensure adequate time for submission. Requests submitted through MEARIS will not only help CMS track requests and streamline the review pro cess, but it will also create efficiencies for requestors when compared to the previous submission process. ICD-10-PCS code request submissions are due no later than December 2, 2022 to be considered for the March 7 -8, 2023 ICD -10 Coordination and Mainten ance Committee Meeting. We anticipate an updated release for MEARIS will be made publicly available by mid -October 2022 for users to continue submitting ICD -10-PCS code requests. The updated release will provide additional resources including templates and sample background papers for submitting a code request for either the administration of a drug/therapeutic agent or for a device/technology/service or procedure . Requests for new procedure codes must include both a background paper utilizing the form at of the sample template provided and an accompanying 508 compliant presentation slide deck. Requestors must also indicate if the code request is for consideration for an October 1 implementation date or an April 1 implementation date at the time of submi ssion to be considered complete. 26 Topic # 05 - Intubated Prone Positioning Issue: There are no unique ICD -10-PCS codes to describe therapeutic intubated prone positioning for acute respiratory distress syndrome. New Technology Application? No. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Approval? No. Background: Prone positioning has been shown to be beneficial in patients with moderate -to- severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a common form of acute respiratory failure in critically ill patients with high mortality. Patients with moderate -to-severe ARDS require the support of mechanical ventilation which is traditionally delivered with the patient lying in the supine position. In the proned position, the weight of the heart, abdomen , and chest wall are shifted off the lungs, and the mechanics of the diaphragm and rib cage are altered. As such, lung compression is relieved and alveolar ventilation is distributed more equally across the lung, improving oxygenation. Prone positioning is one of only two evidence -based treatments that are strongly guideline - recommended for moderate -to-severe ARDS; the other is low tidal volume ventilation 1,2. Other adjunctive treatments with weaker evidence include use of vasodilators, paralytics agents , corticosteroids, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Procedure Description Prone positioning is the coordinated turning of a patient from lying on the back (supine position) to the chest (prone position) by a team of skilled healthcare providers. Because patients with moderate -to severe ARDS are dependent on a mechanical ventilator and often simultaneously connected to multiple life -sustaining tubes, catheters, and monitors, several preparatory steps are needed to prevent accidental dislodgement of the endotracheal tube, catheters and lines. The team prepares the patient by: (1) ensuring that the tip of the endotracheal tube is located 2 -4 cm above the main carina (verified on imaging or bronchoscopy), then taping the endotracheal tube securely, (2) ensuring sufficient tube/catheter length and securing all tubes and catheters (e.g., emanating from waist to head gathered at the head of the bed, emanating from waist to feet gathered at the foot of the bed), (3) holding enteral feeding for 45 minutes to 1 hour prior to proning to reduce risk of aspiration, and (4) applying lubricant to the eyes and prophylactic hydrocolloid dressings to bony prominences (e.g., knees, iliac crest, shoulders, chin) to reduce risk of pressure ulcers. Staff should also ob tain support for the head (e.g., foam donut -shaped pillow), chest/pelvis bolsters (e.g., pillows or rolled bed linens to reduce pressure of the abdomen on the bed), and ensure emergency airway and resuscitation equipment is available at the bedside in case of endotracheal tube dislodgment or hemodynamic compromise. 1 Fan E, Del Sorbo L, Goligher EC, et al. An Official American Thoracic Society/European Society of Intensive Care Medicine/Society of Critical Care Medicine Clinical Practice Guideline: Mechanical Ventilation in Adult Patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2017;195(9):1253 -63. 2 Gacouin A, Boulain T, et al.; PROSEVA Study Group. Prone positioning in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. N Engl J Med 2013;368:2159 -2168. 27 A team of 5 to 6 specially trained health care practitioners is required for a single patient. The team includes an airway expert at the head of the bed, the bedside nurse, and at least 4 addi tional team members with a minimum of 2 staff members positioned on each side of the bed. A review of available equipment and preparatory steps should be conducted as part of an official time out. When all equipment and team members are ready to turn the p atient, the patient's airway should be suctioned and 100% oxygen administered. The team member at the head of the bed manages the airway and directs the team; while other staff members ensure the patient's neck, airway, tubes, and catheters are safely pos itioned and secured throughout. Techniques used to physically turn the patient to a prone position vary, but many protocols include a \"log roll\" method. The patient's arms are tucked at the side, the patient is pulled to the edge of one side of the bed, a new sheet is placed on the bed, the patient is turned to a lateral decubitus position, and then finally repositioned to a prone position in the center of the bed, with bolsters positioned to support the pelvis, chest, and head. The patient's respiratory and hemodynamic status should be carefully monitored once they are placed in the fully proned position. Staff should be prepared to return the patient to the supinated position immediately if respiratory or hemodynamic status declines. Otherwise, patien ts tolerating the proned position may remain proned for 16 to 24 hours at a time. The entire procedure is complete when the patient is returned to the supinated position following the same preparatory and turning steps above. Current Coding: There are no unique ICD -10-PCS codes to describe intubated prone positioning performed in the context of mechanical ventilation. Facilities can report the mechanical ventilation procedure using the appropriate code from the table below .

We stated that we would consider the following during our review. o Was the procedure code related to a new technology add -on payment application (NTAP)? o If yes, was the technology approved for the NTAP? o What is the frequency (total number of cases) of this procedure code as reported in the data for FYs 2016, 2017 and 2018? o Based on review of the data and the clinical aspects of each procedure code, we will propose one of the options below 1. Leave the code in Section X (e.g. procedure codes related to the administration of a specific medication) 2. Reassign the code to the Med/Surg or other section of ICD -10-PCS and delete from Sectio n X (e.g. NTAP has expired, data analysis and clinical review justifies incorporating this technology/procedure into the main Med/Surg section) 3. Delete the Section X code (e.g. the procedure is not reported as anticipated in the data, therefore the absence of a unique code for this technology/procedure in the classification has minimal impact) For the March 2019 ICD -10 C&M meeting we provided the findings from our initial analysis with regard to the frequency in which the New Technology Group 1 codes had be en reported in the data. At the September 2019 meeting we did not propose any changes to the New Technology Group 1 codes and stated we would continue to monitor the data. For the March 2020 ICD -10 C&M meeting we shared the results of our analysis for t he New Technology Group 2 codes within Section X as it has been 3 years since the implementation of those codes. We provided the frequency (total number of cases) of the New Technology Group 2 procedure codes as reported in the data for FYs 2017, 2018, an d 2019. We also updated the data for the New Technology Group 1 codes to include the frequency of the codes for FY 2019. We revised the format in which we display the findings from our analyses. We created an Excel spreadsheet with 2 specific tabs label ed accordingly as Group 1 Codes and Group 2 Codes. On each tab is the list of ICD -10-PCS codes, code description, frequency by fiscal year and if the technology was approved for the NTAP. At the September 2020 ICD -10 C&M meeting we review ied the updated analysis results in more detail and encourage d participants to consider the options listed above while reviewing the data for discussion. Commenters suggested adding another option for consideration. At the March 2021 ICD -10 C&M meeting we proposed chan ges based on the public comments received and discussed a new approach to consider for future proposals. 30 At the September 2021 ICD -10 C&M meeting we reviewed the finalized changes based on the public comments received and shared our analysis results for t he Group 3 Codes from FY 2018, 2019 and 2020. At the March 2022 ICD -10 C&M meeting we displayed the updated data for Group 2 and Group 3 codes with the CMS recommendation. For this September 202 2 ICD-10 C&M meeting we are reviewing the finalized chang es based on the public comments received and sharing our analysis results for the Group 4 Codes from FY 2019 , 2020 , and 2021 . Fourth Option Issue We received overall support for the addition of the fourth option for the Section X codes which was described as creating a unique code in another section of ICD -10-PCS and deleting the existing section X code. As a result, based on review of the data and the clinical aspects of each section X procedure code, we will continue to propose one of the four options l isted below 1. Leave the code in Section X (e.g. procedure codes related to the administration of a specific medication) 2. Reassign the code to the Med/Surg or other section of ICD -10-PCS and delete from Section X (e.g. NTAP has expired, data analysis and clin ical review justifies incorporating this technology/procedure into the main Med/Surg section) 3. Delete the Section X code (e.g. the procedure is not reported as anticipated in the data, therefore the absence of a unique code for this technology/procedure in the classification has minimal impact) 4. Create a new code in Med/Surg or other section of ICD -10-PCS and delete the code from Section X. (e.g. NTAP has expired, data analysis and clinical review justif ies uniquely identifying the technology in the Med/Surg section) We also received support for establishing guiding principles in connection with the fourth option adding another column to the far right to identify the CMS recommendation reminding requestors that Section X codes are temporary and may be sub ject to one of the four listed options at a future meeting CMS continuing to present recommendations for the Section X codes and allowing the public to comment versus having the public submit specific requests 31 Section X - September 2022 Update Group 4 ICD-10- PCS Code Code Description FY 201 9 FY 20 20 FY 20 21 FY 20 22 Freq.

Background: Sickle cell disease (SCD)1 is a serious, progressive and debilitating genetic disease caused by a single mutation in the Beta () -globin gene that leads to the production of abnormal sickle hemoglobin (HbS).2,3,4 In low oxygen conditions, high HbS concentrations cause red blood cells (RBCs) to become sickled, sticky and rigid with a shorter lifespan, which manifests acutely a s hemolytic anemia, vasculopathy and vaso progressive vasculopathy and prolonged hemolytic anemia can result in chronic complications leading to disease progression and end -organ damage.2,3 Chro nic complications of SCD increase in prevalence and severity with age.5,6 The median age of survival of patients with SCD is estimated to be in the fifth or sixth decade of life, which is about 20 -30 years shorter than the general population.7 Current ma nagement of SCD relies on the lifelong use of acute and chronic therapies with suboptimal clinical benefits. Despite these therapies, patients continue to experience clinical symptoms, progressive organ damage, and other substantial morbidities, which cont ribute to decreased quality of life, sociopsychological challenges, significant healthcare resource utilization, and early mortality .2,8,9 Allogeneic hematopoietic -cell transplantation with matched sibling donor (MSD) remains the sole potentially curative treatment in, though its use is limited by donor availability and the risk of graft -versus -host disease and graft rejection .2,10 Lovotibeglogene is a n investigational one-time ex vivo gene addition therapy product being evaluated for the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD) .1 According to the requestor, lovo-cel has the potential to treat the pathophysiological basis of the disease, reducing or eliminating downstream complications. A recent publication in the New England Journal of Medicine11 reported interim analyses of efficacy and safety for patients with SCD treated with lovo - cel in the ongoing open label non -randomized Phase 1/2 study HGB -206.1 As reported by Kanter et al,9 as of the February 17, 2021 data cutoff, there ha d been no reports of graft versus host disease (GvHD), graft failure, replication -competent lentivirus, or vector -mediated insertional oncogenesis 1 https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02140554?term=lentiglobin&cond=sickle+cell&draw=2&rank=2 et al.

Available at https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/sites/default/files/media/docs/ sickle -cell-disease - report%20020816_0.pdf et al. N Engl J Med. 2022;386:617 -628. 40 in subjects from Group C or any subject treated in HGB -206. The safety data from Group C patients in HGB -206 remain generally consistent with the known side effects of autologous hematopoietic stem cell collection and myeloablative single -agent busulfan conditioning, as well as underlying SCD. Mechanism of Action Gene therapy with lovo -cel consists of the autologous tr transduced the BB305 lentiviral vector encoding a modified - globin gene, which results in the production of antisickling hemoglobin HbAT87Q. HbAT87Q is a modified adult hemoglobin (Hb) with an amino -acid substitution (threonine to glutamine at position 87) designed to sterically inhibit polymerization of HbS.11 Lovo -cel administration results in engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) containing the A-T87Q-globin gene permanently integrated into their genomic DNA, enabling durable expres sion of A-T87Q-globin, which prevents the root cause of the disease burden of SCD (polymerization of HbS) by increasing total hemoglobin (Hb) concentration and therefore decreasing the concentration of HbS in a cell suspension for intravenous infusion. The minimum recommended dose is 3.0 \u00d7 106 CD34+ cells/kg, shipped to the hospital i n one or more (up to four) patient -specific infusion bags, in metal cassette(s ) in a cryoshipper. The patient journey or treatment regimen for SCD patients treated with lovo -cel comprises mobilization/apheresis to collect the patient's own stem cells, manufacturing of the gene therapy product utilizing those cells as the starting material (during which the patient remains out of the hospital), myeloablative conditioning, intravenous infusion of lovo -cel and recovery (during which the patient is in hospital). The lovo -cel infusion should be completed as soon as possible and no more than four hours after thawing. Each infusion bag will be administered via intravenous infusion over a period of less than 30 minutes. If more than one infusion bag, all infusion bags must be administered consecutively. The entire volume of each infusion ba g should be infused. The myeloablative conditioning, lovo -cel infusion and monitoring through engraftment is expected to occur in the inpatient setting. In most cases, the mobilization and apheresis procedures also take place in the inpatient setting . Sim ilar to an autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant, following lovo-cel infusion the patient is expected to remain hospitalized for a period of time to allow for engraftment and reconstitution of the immune system. As reported by Kanter et al, 2022, i n the interim analysis of Study HGB -206 Group C, the median (min, max) duration of hospitalization from admission for myeloablative conditioning to post -infusion discharge was 35 (26, 65) days (N=35).9 Current Coding: There are no unique ICD -10-PCS codes describe the intravenous transfusion of lovotibeglogene autotemcel (lovo -cel).

New Technology Application? Yes. The requesto r intends to submit a New Technology Add - on Payment (NTAP) application. The requestor is seeking an April 1, 2023 implementation date. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Approval? No. Background: The B eta () -hemoglobinopathies, which include -thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD), are among the most prevalent monogenic (meaning caused by variation in a single gene ) disorders worldwide. -thalassemia is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a mutation in or near the beta-globin (HBB ) gene that results in reduced or absent production of functional beta -globin . When beta -globin is absent, alpha -globin and its degradation products precipitate, which can cause intracellular hemichrome precipitation, ineffective erythropoiesis, chronic hemolysis, and profound anemia. In transfusion -dependent -thalassemia (TDT), the most clinically severe form of the disease, patients require long -term red -cell transfusions for survival and the prevention of serious complications. SCD, an inherited disorder that affects red blood c ells, is caused by mutations in the HBB gene that contains instructions to make a component of hemoglobin. In sickle cell disease, at least one HBB gene copy contains instructions for making hemoglobin S, while the second gene copy may contain instructions for making another faulty version of the protein, such as hemoglobin C. Red blood cells containing faulty hemoglobin can become misshapen and rigid, making it difficult to pass through small blood vessels, slowing or blocking blood flow. This in turn can compromise oxygen delivery to different tissues and organs, causing damage and inflammation. Blood vessel blockage also can result in episodes of sudden and severe pain, known as vaso -occlusive crises (VOCs). Sickled red blood cells usually break apart and die much quicker than healthy rounded red blood cells are made, causing a shortage of red blood cells, or anemia, the most common symptom of the sickle cell. The current standard of care for patients with TDT consists of lifelong, regular red -cell transf usions and iron chelation. The risks of serious complications from transfusion -related iron toxicity and viral infections persist despite improvements in care. In SCD, commonly used medications include antibiotics to prevent infections and painkillers to m anage pain. Other treatments also are available to reduce the frequency of pain crises, including hydrox yurea and Adakveo (crizanlizumab). The only potentially curative both -thalassemia and SCD is allogeneic hematopoietic -cell transplantation. Such transplants are complex, however, and carry risks such as graft rejection, graft -versus -host disea se, and other treatment -related toxic effects. Exa-cel, also known as CTX001 , is an investigational therapy based on the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR ) and CRISPR editing tool . CRISPR/C as9 edits genes by precisely cutting DNA and then letting natural DNA repair processes to take over. Exa-cel is designed to modify a patient's blood cell precursors to produce high levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) . HbF is a form of oxygen -carrying hemoglo bin found in newborn red blood cells that transports oxygen more efficiently than its adult equivalent 43 (Hb). HbF can substitute for the diseased hemoglobin in TDT and SCD patients , reducing or eliminating symptoms. Mechanism of Action As a therapy, exa-cel involves isolating a patient's own hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) , editing them with CRISPR/Cas9 to increase HbF in the red blood cells , and then returning the edited cells to the patient through a stem cell transplant . The target of CRISPR/Cas9 editing is the erythroid -specific enhancer region of BCL11A. Reducing BCL11A expression increases fetal hemoglobin expression. According to the requestor, t he elevation of HbF by exa-cel has the potential to alleviate or eliminate transfusion requirements for pa tients with TDT and reduce painful and debilitating sickle crises for patients with SCD . Exa-cel is being studied in clinical trials. The safety data reported to date for exa -cel has been consistent with an autologous stem cell transplant and myeloablativ e conditioning with busulfan. Inpatient Administration of Exagamglogene Exa-cel is prepared from a patient's own HSCs, which are collected from the peripheral blood . The cells are edited at a manufacturing facility, cryopreserved and shipped back to the authorized treatment center (e.g., hospital). Once the cells are received at the authorized treatment center, the patient undergoes myeloablative conditioning with busulfan before the cells are infused. Exa-cel is then administered via a stem cell transplant procedure as a single dose through a central venous catheter, at least 48 hours and within 7 days after the last busulfan dose. Monitoring for adverse events and engraftment occurs along with the administration of any supportive ther apy that may be required. Once engraftment occurs, the cells begin production of red blood cells that express fetal hemoglobin.
