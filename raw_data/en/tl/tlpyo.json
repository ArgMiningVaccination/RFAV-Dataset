[7500] CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 11 Section II Program's Performance Measurement and Progress This section consists of two subsections that gather information about the CHIP and/or Medicaid program. Section IIA captures your e nrollment progress as well as changes in the number and/or rate of uninsured children in your state. Section IIB captures progress towards meeting your state's general strategic objectives and performance goals. Section IIA: Enrollment And Uninsured Data 1. The information in the table below is the Unduplicated Number of Children Ever Enrolled in CHIP in your state for the two most recent reporting periods. The enrollment numbers reported below should correspond to line 7 (Unduplicated Number Ever Enrolled Year) in your state's 4th quarter data report (submitted in October) in the CHIP Statistical Enrollment Data System (SEDS). The percent change column reflects the percent change in enrollment over the two -year period. If the percent change exceeds 10 percent (increase or decrease), please explain in letter A below any factors that may account for these changes (such as decreases due to elimination of outreach or increases due to program expansions). This information will be filled in autom atically by CARTS through a link to SEDS. Please wait until you have an enrollment number from SEDS before you complete this response. If the information displayed in the table below is inaccurate, please make any needed updates to the data in SEDS and th en refresh this page in CARTS to reflect the updated data. Program FFY 201 8 FFY 201 9 Percent change FFY 2018-2019 CHIP Medicaid Expansion Program 928 764 -17.67 Separate Child Health Program 3115 2750 -11.72 A. Please explain any factors that may account for enrollment increases or decreases exceeding 10 percent. [7500] a) this follows the overall reduction in MA enrollment likely due to the positive economic growth over these two years, and b) these are relative ly small populations so small reductions in enrollees produce relatively large percentage changes. 2. The tables below show trends in the number and rate of uninsured children in your state. Three year averages in Table 1 are based on the Current Population Survey. The single year estimates in Table 2 are based on the American Community Survey (ACS). CARTS will fill in the single year estimates automatically, and significant changes are denoted with an asterisk (*).If your state uses an alternate data source and/or methodology for measuring change in the number and/or rate of uninsured children, please explain in Question #3.

[7500] Enter any Narrative text related to Section IIA below. [7500] CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 14 Section IIB: State Strategic Objectives And Performance Goals This subsection gathers information on your state's general strategic objectives, performance goals, performance measures and progress towards meeting goals, as specified in your CHIP state plan. (If your goals r eported in the annual report now differ from Section 9 of your CHIP state plan, please indicate how they differ in \"Other Comments on Measure.\" Also, the state plan should be amended to reconcile these differences). The format of this section provides your state with an opportunity to track progress over time. This section contains templates for reporting performance measurement data for each of five categories of strategic objectives, related to: Reducing the number of uninsured children CHIP enrollment Medicaid enrollment Increasing access to care Use of preventative care (immunizations, well child care) Please report performance measurement data for the three most recent years for which data are available (to the extent that data are available). In the first two columns, data from the previous two years' annual reports (FFY 2017 and FFY 201 8) will be populated with data from previously reported data in CARTS. If you reported data in the two previous years' reports and you want to update/change the data, please enter that data. If you reported no data for either of those two years, but you now have data available for them, please enter the data. In the third column, please report the most recent data available at the time you are submitting the current annual report (FFY 2019 ). In this section, the term performance measure is used to refer to any data your state provides as evidence towards a particular goal within a strategic objective. For the purpose of this section, \"objectives\" refer to the five br oad categories listed above, while \"goals\" are state -specific, and should be listed in the appropriate subsections within the space provided for each objective. NOTES: Please do not reference attachments in this section. If details about a particular meas ure are located in an attachment, please summarize the relevant information from the attachment in the space provided for each measure. In addition, please do not report the same data that were reported for Child Core Set reporting. The intent of this sect ion is to capture goals and measures that your state did not report elsewhere. As a reminder, Child Core Set reporting migrated to MACPRO in December 2015. Historical data are still available for viewing in CARTS. Additional instructions for completing eac h row of the table are provided below. A. Goal: For each objective, space has been provided to report up to three goals. Use this section to provide a brief description of each goal you are reporting within a given strategic objective. All new goals should include a direction and a target. For clarification only, an example goal would be : \"Increase (direction) by 5 percent (target) the number of CHIP beneficiaries who turned 13 years old during the measurement year who had a second dose of MMR, three hepat itis B vaccinations and one varicella vaccination by their 13th birthday.\" B. Type of Goal: For each goal you are reporting within a given strategic objective, please indicate the type of goal, as follows: CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 15 New/revised : Check this box if you have revised or ad ded a goal. Please explain how and why the goal was revised. Continuing : Check this box if the goal you are reporting is the same one you have reported in previous annual reports. Discontinued : Check this box if you have met your goal and/or are discontin uing a goal. Please explain why the goal was discontinued. C. Status of Data Reported: Please indicate the status of the data you are reporting for each goal, as follows: Provisional: Check this box if you are reporting performance measure data for a goal, but the data are currently being modified, verified, or may change in any other way befor e you finalize them for FFY 2019 . Explanation of Provisional Data - When the value of the Status of Data Reported field is selected as \"Provisional\", the state must specify why the data are provisional and when the state expects the data will be final. Final: Check this box if the data you are reporting a re considered f inal for FFY 2019 . Same data as reported in a previous year's annual report: Check this box if the data you are reporting are the same data that your state reported for the goal in another annual report. Indicate in which year's annual report you previous ly reported the data. D. Measurement Specification: This section is included for only two of the objectives \u2014 objectives related to increasing access to care, and objectives related to use of preventative care \u2014because these are the two objectives for which sta tes may report using the HEDIS\u00ae measurement specification. In this section, for each goal, please indicate the measurement specification used to calculate your performance measure data (i.e., were the measures calculated using the HEDIS\u00ae specifications or some other method unrelated to HEDIS\u00ae). Please indicate whether the measure is based on HEDIS\u00ae technical specifications or another source. If HEDIS\u00ae is selected, the HEDIS\u00ae Version field must be completed. If \"Other\" measurement specification is selecte d, the explanation field must be completed. HEDIS\u00ae Version: Please specify HEDIS\u00ae Version (example 2016). This field must be completed only when a user selects the HEDIS\u00ae measurement specification. \"Other\" measurement specification explanation: If \"Other\", measurement specification is selected, please complete the explanation of the \"Other\" measurement specification. The explanation field must be completed when \"Other\" measurement specification has been selected. E. Data Source: For each performance measure, please indicate the source of data. The categories provided in this section vary by objective. For the objectives related to reducing the number of uninsured children and CHIP or Medicaid enrollment, please indicate whether you have used eligibility/enro llment data, survey data (specify the survey used), or other source (specify the other source). For the objectives related to access to care and use of preventative care, please indicate whether you used administrative data (claims) (specify the kind of a dministrative data used), hybrid data (claims and medical records) (specify how the two were used to create the data source), survey data (specify the survey used), or other source (specify the other source). In all cases, if another data source was used, please explain the source. CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 16 F. Definition of Population Included in Measure: Numerator: Please indicate the definition of the population included in the numerator for each measure (such as the number of visits required for inclusion, e.g., one or more visits in the past year). Denominator: Please indicate the definition of the population included in the denominator for each measure. For measures related to increasing access to care and use of preventative care, please Check one box to indicate whether the da ta are for the CHIP population only, or include both CHIP and Medicaid (Title XIX) children combined. If the denominator reported is not fully representative of the population defined above (the CHIP population only, or the CHIP and Medicaid (Title XIX) po pulations combined), please further define the denominator. For example, denominator includes only children enrolled in managed care in certain counties, technological limitations preventing reporting on the full population defined, etc.). Please report in formation on exclusions in the definition of the denominator (including the proportion of children excluded), The provision of this information is important and will provide CMS with a context so that comparability of denominators across the states and ove r time can occur. G. Deviations from Measure Specification For the measures related to increasing access to care and use of preventative care. If the data provided for a measure deviates from the measure specification, please select the type(s) of measure specification deviation. The types of deviation parallel the measure specification categories for each measure. Each type of deviation is accompanied by a comment field that states must use to explain in greater detail or further specify the deviat ion when a deviation(s) from a measure is selected. The five types (and examples) of deviations are: Year of Data (e.g., partial year), Data Source (e.g., use of different data sources among health plans or delivery systems), Numerator (e.g., coding issue s), Denominator (e.g., exclusion of MCOs, different age groups, definition of continuous enrollment), Other. When one or more of the types are selected, states are required to provide an explanation. Please report the year of data for each performance meas ure. The year (or months) should correspond to the period in which enrollment or utilization took place. Do not report the year in which data were collected for the measure, or the version of HEDIS\u00ae used to calculate the measure, both of which may be different from the period corresponding to enrollment or utilization of services. H. Date Range: available for 201 9 CARTS reporting period. Please define the date range for the reporting period based on the \"From\" time period as the month and year which corresp onds to the beginning period in which utilization took place and please report the \"To\" time period as the month and year which corresponds to the end period in which utilization took place. Do not report the year in which data were collected for the measu re, or the version of HEDIS\u00ae used to calculate the measure, both of which may be different from the period corresponding to utilization of services. I. Performance Measurement Data (HEDIS\u00ae or Other): In this section, please report the numerators and denominat ors, rates for each measure (or component). The template provides two sections for entering the performance measurement data, depending on CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 17 whether you are reporting using HEDIS\u00ae or other methodologies. The form fields have been set up to facilitate enter ing numerators and denominators for each measure. If the form fields do not give you enough space to fully report on the measure, please use the \"additional notes\" section. The preferred method is to calculate a \"weighted rate\" by summing the numerators a nd denominators across plans, and then deriving a single state -level rate based on the ratio of the numerator to the denominator). The reporting unit for each measure is the state as a whole. If states calculate rates for multiple reporting units (e.g., i ndividual health plans, different health care delivery systems), states must aggregate data from all these sources into one state rate before reporting the data to CMS. In the situation where a state combines data across multiple reporting units, all or some of which use the hybrid method to calculate the rates, the state should enter zeroes in the \"Numerator\" and \"Denominator\" fields. In these cases, it should report the state -level rate in the \"Rate\" field and, when possible, include individual report ing unit numerators, denominators, and rates in the field labeled \"Additional Notes on Measure,\" along with a description of the method used to derive the state -level rate. J. Explanation of Progress: The intent of this section is to allow your state to highl ight progress and describe any quality -improvement activities that may have contributed to your progress. Any quality -improvement activity described should involve the CHIP program, benefit CHIP enrollees, and relate to the performance measure and your progress. An example of a quality -improvement activity is a state -wide initiative to inform individual families directly of their children's immunization status with the goal of increasing immunization rates. CHIP would either be the primary lead or substa ntially involved in the project. If improvement has not occurred over time, this section can be used to discuss potential reasons for why progress was not seen and to describe future quality -improvement plans. In this section, your state is also asked to set annual performance objectives for FFY 20 20, 202 1 and 202 2. Based on your recent performan ce on the measure (from FFY 2017 through 201 9), use a combination of expert opinion and \"best guesses\" to set objectives for the next three years. Please explain your rationale for setting these objectives. For example, if your rate has been increasing by 3 or 4 percentage points per year, you might project future increases at a similar rate. On the other hand, if your rate has been stable over time, you might s et a target that projects a small increase over time. If the rate has been fluctuating over time, you might look more closely at the data to ensure that the fluctuations are not an artifact of the data or the methods used to construct a rate. You might s et an initial target that is an average of the recent rates, with slight increases in subsequent years. In future annual reports, you will be asked to comment on how your actual performance compares to the objective your state set for the year, as well as any quality -improvement activities that have helped or could help your state meet future objectives. K. Other Comments on Measure: Please use this section to provide any other comments on the measure, such as data limitations, plans to report on a measure in the future, or differences between performance measures reported here and those discussed in Section 9 of the CHIP state plan.

What other strategies does your state use to measure and report on access to, quality, or outcomes of care received by your CHIP population? What have you found? [7500] The Department monitors utilization of services in all MCOs. The Department monitors all MCO service decisions through monthly reports of all service details, reductions and terminations, and also monitors the outcome of all grievances and appeals filed as a result of MCO actions. The state conducts an annual quality review of MCOs servin g public health program enrollees 2. What strategies does your CHIP program have for future measurement and reporting on access to, quality, or outcomes of care received by your CHIP population? When will data be available? [7500] The Medicaid and CHIP chi ld populations participate in MN DHS' managed care organizations (MCO) quality measures. Each MCO has quality measures required by its Medicaid agency contract, and may also have other quality initiatives related to the MCO's accreditations (for example, N CQA) for pediatric populations. MN DHS specifically measures the following pediatric access, quality, and outcomes, here referenced by the relevant section of the 2019 MCO families and children contract: 4.14.2 Withheld funds for performance related to co mprehensive dental care, ages 1 through 20 years. 6.1.5 Notice to enrollees up to age 21 about availability of Child & Teen Check -up (EPSDT) services, provision of services, and reporting 7.13 MCO Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement Program r equirements; childhood immunization status, immunizations for adolescents, prenatal and post -partum care, and well - child visits are measured by HEDIS, a national measure allowing comparisons across many populations. 7.3 Disease management for asthma , diabetes. 3. Have you conducted any focused quality studies on your CHIP population, e.g., adolescents, attention deficit disorder, substance abuse, special heath care needs or other emerging health care needs? What have you found? [7500] The state has n o other focused quality studies related to specific health care needs. 4. Please attach any additional studies, analyses or other documents addressing outreach, enrollment, access, quality, utilization, costs, satisfaction, or other aspects of your CHIP progr am's performance. Please include any analyses or descriptions of any efforts designed to reduce the number of uncovered children in the state through a state health insurance connector program or support for innovative private health coverage initiatives. [7500] The state has no additional reports of program performance. Enter any Narrative text related to Section IIB below.

You will not be able to enter responses with characters greater than the limit indicated in the brackets. Section IIIA: Outreach 1. How have you redirected/changed your outreach strategies dur ing the reporting period? [7500] Minnesota has not changed it outreach strategies during FFY 2019. 2. What methods have you found most effective in reaching low -income, uninsured children (e.g., T.V., school outreach, word -of-mouth)? How have you measured effectiveness? [7500] 3. Which of the methods described in Question 2 would you consider a best practic e(s)? [7500] In-person contact remains the best strategy. 4. Is your state targeting outreach to specific populations (e.g., minorities, immigrants, and children living in rural areas)? Yes No Have these efforts been successful, and how have you measured effectiveness? [7500] 5. What percentage of children below 200 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) who are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP have been enrolled in those programs? [5] 98.35 (Identify the data source used). [7500] Enter any Narrative text related to Section IIIA below. [7500] About 4.6% of point -in-time child enrollees under age 19 in Minnesota Medicaid or SCHIP programs have family income over 200% FPL. Applying one minus this proportion to ever -enrolled in FFY 2019 (626,011 x .954) results in 597,000 ever -enrol led children with family income at/below 200% FPL. Adding ever -enrolled in Medicaid or SCHIP (597,000 to children who are uninsured all year (10,600) in 2017 State survey data = 607,600 children potentially eligible for Medicaid or SCHIP who are under age 19 with family income at/below 200% FPL. The percentage enrolled during FFY 2019 = 597,000/607,600 = 98.2% CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 51 Section IIIB: Substitution of Coverage (Crowd -out) Please answer the following questions as they apply to your state's program (some quest ions are not applicable to Medicaid expansion programs.)

Duration Measure of Selected Children, Ages 0 -16, Enrolled in Title XIX and Title XXI, Second Quarter FFY 2018 The purpose of tables 3a and 3b is to measure the duration, or continuity, of Medicaid and CHIP enrollees' coverage. This information is required by Section 402(a) of CHIPRA. Reporting on this table is required . The measure is designed to capture continuity of cove rage for a cohort of children in title XIX and title XXI for 18 months of enrollment. This means that reporting spans two CARTS reports over two years, with enrollment status at 6 months being reported in the first reporting ye ar, and 12 and 18 month enrollment status reported in the second reporting year. States identify a new cohort of children every two years. States identify newly enrolled children in the second quarter of FFY 2018 (January, February, and March of 2018) for the FFY 2018 CARTS report. This same cohort of children will be reported on in the FFY 2019 CARTS report for the 12 and 18 month status of children newly identified in quarter 2 of FFY 2018 If your eligibility system already has the capability to track a cohort of enrollees over t ime, an additional \"flag\" or unique identifier may not be necessary. The FFY 2019 CARTS report is the second year of reporting in the cycle of two CARTS reports on the cohort of children identif ied in the second quarter of FFY 2018. For the FFY 2018 report , States only reported on lines 1 -4a of the tables. In the FFY 2019 report, no updates will be made to lines 1-4a. For the FFY 2019 report, data will be added to lines 5 -10a.The next cohort of children will be identified in the second quarter of the FFY 20 20 (January, February and March of 2020). Instructions : For this measure, please identify newly enrolled children in both title XIX (for Table 3a) and title XXI (for Table 3b) in the second quarter of FFY 2018, ages 0 months to 16 years at time of enrollme nt. Children enrolled in January 2018 must have birthdates after July 2001 (e.g., children must be younger than 16 years and 5 months) to ensure that they will not age out of the program at the 18th month of coverage. Simil arly, children enrolled in Febru ary 2018 must have birthdates after August 2001, and children enrolled in March 2018 must have birthdates after September 200 1. Each child newly enrolled during this time frame needs a unique identifier or \"flag\" so that the cohort can be tracked over tim e. If your eligibility system already has the capability to track a cohort of enrollees over time, an additional \"flag\" or unique identifier may not be necessary. Please follow the child based on the child's age category at the time of enrollment (e.g., the child's age at enrollment creates an age cohort that does not change over the 18 month time span) Please enter the data requested in the tables below, and the template will tabulate the percentages. In the FFY 2019 report you will enter data on lines 5-7a related to the 12 -month enrollment status of children identified on line 1. You will also enter data on lines 8 -10a related to the 18 -month enrollment status of children identified on line 1. Only enter a \"0\" (zero) if the data are known to be zero. If data are unknown or unavailable, leave the field blank. Note that all data must sum correctly in order to save and move to the next page . The data in each individual row must add across to sum to the total in the \"All Children Ages 0 -16\" column for th at row. And in each column, the data within each time period (6, 12 and 18 months) must each sum up to the data in row 1, which is the number of children in the cohort. This means that in each column, rows 2, 3 and 4 must sum to the tot al in row 1; rows 5, 6 and 7 must sum to row 1; and rows 8, 9 and 10 must sum to row 1. These tables track a child's enrollment status over time, so when data are added or modified at each milestone (6, 12, and 18 months), there should always be the same total number of chi ldren accounted for in line 1 \"All Children Ages 0 -16\" over the entire 18 month period. Rows numbered with an \"a\" (e.g., rows 3a and 4a) are excluded from the totals because they are subsets of their respective ro ws. The system will not move to the next s ection of the report until all applicable sections of the table for the reporting year are complete and sum correctly to line 1.

CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 72 Section IIIH: CHIPRA CAHPS Requirement: CHIPRA section 402(a)(2), which amends reporting requirements in section 2108 of the Social Security Act, requires Title XXI Programs (i.e., CHIP Medicaid Expansion programs, Separate Child Health Programs, or a combination of the two) to report CAHPS res ults to CMS starting December 2013. While Title XXI Programs may select any CAHPS survey to fulfill this requirement, CMS encourages these programs to align with the CAHPS measure in the Children's Core Set of Health Care Quality Measures for Medicaid and CHIP (Child Core Set). Starting in 2013, Title XXI Programs should submit summary level information from the CAHPS survey to CMS via the CARTS attachment facility. We also encourage states to submit raw data to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Qua lity's CAHPS Database. More information is available in the Technical Assistance fact sheet, Collecting and Reporting the CAHPS Survey as Required Under the CHIPRA: https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/quality -of- care/downloads/cahpsfactsheet.pdf If a state would like to provide CAHPS data on both Medicaid and CHIP enrollees, the ag ency must sample Title XIX (Medicaid) and Title XXI (CHIP) programs separately and submit separate results to CMS to fulfill the CHIPRA Requirement.
