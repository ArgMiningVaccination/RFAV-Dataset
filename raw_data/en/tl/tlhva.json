Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection. Available athttp://aidsinfo.nih.gov/contentfiles/lvguidelines/pediatricguidelines.pdf . Accessed (insert date) [include page numbers, table number, etc. if applicable] Use of antiretrovirals in pediatric patients is evolving rapidly. These guidelines are updated regularly to provide current information.The most recent information is available athttp://aidsinfo.nih.gov . access AIDS info mobile siteGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection iWhat's New in the Pediatric Guidelines (Last updated November 5, 2012; last reviewed November 1, 2012) Key changes made to update the August 11, 2011, Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection are summarized below. Minor revisions have been made in toxicity tables and other sections of the document; all changes are highlighted throughout the guidelines. Throughout thedocument, references have been updated to include new publications where relevant. Diagnosis of HIV infection New section on diagnostic testing in children with perinatal HIV exposure in exceptional situations: late seroreversion up to 24 months of age, postnatal exposure in children with prior negativevirologic tests for whom there are additional HIV transmission risks (e.g., breastfeeding, feedingpremasticated food), and non-subtype B HIV-1 infection and HIV-2 infection. New section on diagnostic testing in children with non-perinatal exposure. When to Start Antiretroviral Therapy CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4 cell) count and CD4 percentage thresholds for initiation of treatment are now offered for children aged >12 months, but in the case of discordance between CD4 cell countsand percentages, decisions should be based on the lower value. Although CD4 percentage had been preferentially used to monitor immunologic status in children aged <5 years, recent analyses show that CD4 cell counts provide greater prognostic value than CD4percentage for short-term disease progression in children aged <5 years as well as in older children. CD4 thresholds for treatment have been further subdivided into age groups 1 to <3, 3 to <5, and 5 years to more precisely link them to age-related changes in absolute CD4 cell count. The Panel continues to recommend treatment of all HIV-infected infants aged <12 months, regardless of clinical status, CD4 percentage, or viral load (AI for infants aged <12 weeks and AII for infants aged 12 weeks to 12 months). The Panel discusses current adult antiretroviral (ARV) guidelines and similarities and differences between children and adults. Adult guidelines have been modified to recommend treatment for all HIV-infected individuals, with the strength of the recommendation based on the pre-treatment CD4 cell count. In addition to recommending treatment for all children with AIDS or significant HIV-related symptoms (AI*), the Panel also generally recommends treatment for all children aged 1 year with minimal or no symptoms (Clinical Categories N and A, or Clinical Category B disease due to asingle episode of bacterial infection), with the strength of recommendation based on age and CD4cell count/percentage. However, on a case-by-case basis, providers may elect to defer therapy basedon clinical and/or psychosocial factors. ART should be initiated in HIV-infected children aged 1 year with minimal or no symptoms with the following CD4 values: Aged 1 to <3 years: <1000 cells/mm <750 cells/mm3or CD4 percentage <25% (AII)Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection ii Aged 5 years: With CD4 cell count 500 cells/mm3(AI* for CD4 BII* for CD4 count 350-500 cells/mm3) ART should be considered for HIV-infected children aged 1 year with minimal or no symptoms with the following CD4 values: Aged 1 to <3 years: With CD4 cell count 1000 cells/mm3or CD4 Aged years: count >500 cells/mm3(BIII) In children with lower-strength (B level) recommendations for treatment, plasma HIV RNA levels >100,000 copies/mL provide stronger evidence for initiation of treatment (BII). What Drugs to Start: Initial Combination Therapy for Antiretroviral Treatment-Naive Children Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir) has recently been FDA-approved for children as young as age 2 years. The Panel has modified its recommendations for use of tenofovir in children based on Tanner staging. Tenofovir, in combination with lamivudine or emtricitabine, is part of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) combination for adolescents whoare Tanner stage 4 or 5 (AI*), an Alternative choice for those who are Tanner stage 3, and reservedfor Special Circumstances for those aged 2 years and Tanner stage 1 or 2. Etravirine and rilpivirine are also FDA-approved but are not recommended as initial therapy at this time because of lack of experience and dosing information in children. Boosted fosamprenavir is now FDA-approved for infants as young as age 4 weeks, provided that they were born at 38 weeks' gestation. However, because of palatability and lower drug exposure inyoung infants, boosted fosamprenavir, when used in combination with 2 NRTIs, is an Alternativeoption only in infants and children aged 6 months and older. Darunavir with low-dose ritonavir is now FDA-approved and, when used in combination with 2 NRTIs, an Alternative regimen in children aged 3 years. Once-daily dosing of boosted darunavir inchildren aged <12 years is not recommended. Raltegravir is now FDA-approved for children aged 2 years, but are not recommended for initial therapy at this time because of insufficient data. Elvitegravir, another integrase inhibitor, is only available as a fixed-dose combination tablet containing elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/ tenofovir, and is FDA-approved for HIV-1-infected ARV treatment-naive adults, but not children aged <18 years. Given the lack of data in individuals aged <18 years, it cannot be considered for useas initial therapy in children at this time. Although emerging information about the use of efavirenz in pregnancy is reassuring, the Panel awaits additional safety information and recommends that alternative regimens that do not include efavirenz be strongly considered in adolescent females who are trying to conceive or who are notusing effective and consistent contraception because of the potential for teratogenicity with first trimester efavirenz exposure, assuming these alternative regimens are acceptable to the provider andwill not compromise a woman's health (BIII).Management of Treatment-Experienced Infants, Children, and Adolescents Management of treatment failure has been more clearly limited to management of virologic treatment failure. There is no consensus on how to manage immunologic or clinical treatment failure in the absence of virologic treatment failure. Newer individual drugs and classes of ARV drugs have been incorporated into both the discussion and the table of new regimen options for children with treatment failure (Table 20 ). Specific Issues in Adolescents Updates have been provided in the section on contraceptive and ARV drug interactions. An update was provided regarding pregnancy outcomes in adolescent girls. Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information Updates with new pediatric data are provided when relevant for specific drugs. Emtricitabine: The Panel provides neonatal pharmacokinetic (PK) data at a dose of 3mg/kg/day, and PK data in children indicating that the oral solution has 20% lower plasma exposure than the capsule formulation. Information is provided on Complera (fixed-dose combination of tenofovir,emtricitabine, and rilpivirine) for adolescents aged >18 years and adults. Lamivudine: The Panel provides information on generic tablet formulations and weight band dosing for children who weigh 14 kg, using 150-mg scored tablets. The Panel discusses switching fromtwice-daily to once-daily dosing at 8 to10 mg/kg, based on review of data from the PENTA 13 and15 and ARROW trials. Stavudine: The Panel recommends a maximum dose of 30 mg of stavudine. Tenofovir: The Panel provides information on the newly available pediatric oral powder and tablets of lower milligram amounts (150, 200, and 250 mg), and dosing by weight band starting at age 2years and 10 kg, with a discussion of the recommended pediatric dose of 8 mg/kg/dose once dailyand results of the studies that led to registration of the drug. The Panel notes Truvada(emtricitabine/tenofovir) is now FDA-approved for use in adolescents aged 12 years and whoweigh 35 kg; and Atripla (emtricitabine/tenofovir/efavirenz) is now FDA-approved for use inadolescents aged 12 years and who weigh 40 kg. Zidovudine: Dosing recommendations for zidovudine used as prophylaxis for prevention of mother- to-child HIV transmission and in infants have been updated. Efavirenz: Additional detail has been added involving the precaution against using efavirenz in women of childbearing potential. Etravirine: Pediatric dosing recommendations have been updated to reflect FDA approval for treatment-experienced children aged 6 to <18 years. Nevirapine: The Panel notes data showing a three-fold increased risk of rash and hepatotoxicity in children with CD4 percentage >15% when initiating nevirapine. Rilpivirine: The Panel notes the availability of Complera (fixed-dose combination of tenofovir, emtricitabine, and rilpivirine) for adolescents aged >18 years and adults. A pediatric trial is under way in treatment-naive adolescents aged 12 to 18 years. The Panel recommends that rilpivirine should be administered with a meal that contains at least 500 calories, and notes that rilpivirine should not be used with proton pump inhibitors. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection iiiAtazanavir: Modifications have been made in the dosing table and new dosing recommendations are discussed. Darunavir: Additional dosing down to a weight of 10 kg and PK of this dosing by weight band are described. The caveat against darunavir use in children aged <3 years was strengthened and explained more fully: Do not use darunavir in children aged <3 years because of concerns related toseizures and death in infant rats due to immaturity of the blood-brain barrier and liver metabolicpathways. Fosamprenavir: The Panel added information on FDA approval in infants as young as 4 weeks but notes that the Panel does not recommend use in infants aged <6 months, given concerns aboutpalatability and low drug level exposures. Details about PK have also been added and a dosing tablewas added for children aged 6 months to 18 years. Lopinavir/ritonavir: The Panel discusses a preference for dosing in children at 300 mg lopinavir/m 2 twice daily rather than 230 mg/m2twice daily, particularly for ARV-experienced patients. Raltegravir: Information has been added on the newly available pediatric chewable tablets (25 and 100 mg), dosing by weight band starting at age 2 years, and results from the trials that led to FDAapproval in children are summarized. Elvitegravir: Information has been added on the newly available fixed-dose combination tablet containing the integrase strand transfer theNRTIs emtricitabine and tenofovir. The Panel notes there are no data on its use in individuals aged<18 years.

Included is information on management of adverse events associated with useof antiretroviral (ARV) drugs in children and details on pediatric data related to ARV agents. The Departmentof Health and Human Services (HHS) Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of HIV-Infected Children, a working group of the Office of AIDS Research Advisory Council (OARAC), reviewsnew data on an ongoing basis and provides regular updates to the guidelines. The guidelines are available onthe AIDSinfo website at http://aidsinfo.nih.gov . Also available on the AIDSinfo website are separate sets of guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-exposed and -infected children1and for the use of ARV agents in HIV- infected (postpubertal) adolescents and adults.2Because these guidelines are developed for the United States, they may not be applicable in other countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) provides guidelinesfor resource-limited settings at http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/arv/en . Advances in medical management, based on results of clinical trials of ARV combination therapies inchildren, have dramatically reduced morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected children in the United Statessince the guidelines were first developed in 1993 (with the support of the Francois-Xavier Bagnoud Center,University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey). HIV mortality has decreased by more than 80% to90% since the introduction of protease inhibitor (PI)-containing combinations and opportunistic and otherrelated infections have significantly declined in the era of ART. 3, 4Resistance testing has enhanced the ability to choose very effective initial regimens while preserving selected drugs and drug classes for second- orthird-line regimens. Therapeutic strategies continue to focus on timely initiation of ARV regimens capable ofmaximally suppressing viral replication to prevent disease progression, preserve immunologic function, andreduce the development of resistance. At the same time, availability of new drugs and drug formulations hasled to more potent regimens with lower toxicity, lower pill burdens, and less frequent medicationadministration, all factors which are associated with better adherence and outcomes. The use of ARV drugsduring pregnancy in HIV-infected women has resulted in a dramatic decrease in the rate of HIV transmissionto infants in the United States, to less than 2%. The number of infants with AIDS in the United Statescontinues to decline because of the low rate of new infant infections and the availability of ART to preventAIDS in HIV-infected infants. 5, 6Finally, as a group, children living with HIV infection are growing older, bringing new challenges related to adherence, drug resistance, reproductive health planning, management ofmultiple drugs, and potential for long-term complications from HIV and its treatments. The pathogenesis of HIV infection and the general virologic and immunologic principles underlying the use of ART are similar for all HIV-infected people, but unique considerations exist for HIV-infected infants, children, and adolescents, including: Acquisition of infection through perinatal exposure for most infected children; In utero, intrapartum, and/or postpartum neonatal exposure to ARV drugs in most perinatally infected children; Requirement for use of HIV virologic tests to diagnose perinatal HIV infection in infants younger than age 18 months; Age-specific differences in interpreting CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4 cell) counts; Changes in pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters with age caused by the continuing development and maturation of organ systems involved in drug metabolism and clearance; Differences in the clinical manifestations and treatment of HIV infection secondary to onset of infection in growing, immunologically immature individuals; andGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection A-2Topic Comment Goal of the guidelines Provide guidance to HIV care practitioners on the optimal use of antiretroviral (ARV) agents in HIV- 1-infected infants, children, and adolescents (through puberty) in the United States. Panel members The Panel is composed of approximately 25 voting members who have expertise in management ofHIV infection in infants, children, and adolescents. Members include representatives from theCommittee on Pediatric AIDS of the American Academy of Pediatrics and community representativeswith knowledge of pediatric HIV infection. The Panel also includes at least one representative fromeach of the following Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) agencies: Centers forDisease Control and Prevention (CDC), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Health Resources andServices Administration (HRSA), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). A representative fromthe Canadian Pediatric AIDS Research Group participates as a nonvoting, ex officio member of thePanel. The U.S. government representatives are appointed by their respective agencies;nongovernmental members are selected after an open announcement to call for nominations. Eachmember serves on the Panel for a 3-year term with an option for reappointment. A list of currentmembers can be found in the Panel Roster . Financial disclosure All members of the Panel submit a financial disclosure statement in writing annually, reporting anyassociation with manufacturers of ARV drugs or diagnostics used for management of HIV infections.A list of the latest disclosures is available on the AIDS infowebsite ( http://aidsinfo.nih.gov ). Users of the guidelines Providers of care to HIV-infected infants, children, and adolescents Developer Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of HIV-Infected Children\u2014a working group of OARAC Funding source Office of AIDS Research, NIH and Health Resources and Services Administration Evidence collection A standardized review of recent relevant literature related to each section of the guidelines is performed by a representative of the Francois-Xavier Bagnoud Center and provided to individualPanel section working groups. The recommendations are generally based on studies published inpeer-reviewed journals. On some occasions, particularly when new information may affect patientsafety, unpublished data presented at major conferences or prepared by the FDA and/ormanufacturers as warnings to the public may be used as evidence to revise the guidelines. Recommendation grading Described in Table 2 . Method of synthesizing dataEach section of the guidelines is assigned to a small group of Panel members with expertise in the area of interest. The members synthesize the available data and propose recommendations to the Panel. The Panel discusses and votes on all proposals during monthly teleconferences. Proposals endorsed by a consensus of members are included in the guidelines as official Panel recommendations. Special considerations associated with adherence to ARV treatment in infants, children, and adolescents. These recommendations represent the current state of knowledge regarding the use of ARV drugs in children and are based on published and unpublished data regarding the treatment of HIV infection in infants,children, adolescents, and adults, and when no definitive data were available, on the clinical expertise of thePanel members. The Panel intends the guidelines to be flexible and not to replace the clinical judgment ofexperienced health care providers. Guidelines Development Process Table 1. Outline of the Guidelines Development ProcessGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection A-3Topic Comment Other guidelines These guidelines focus on HIV-infected infants, children, and adolescents through puberty. For more detailed discussion of issues of treatment of postpubertal adolescents, the Panel defers to thedesignated expertise offered by the Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents. Separate guidelines outline the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV-infected pregnant women and interventions for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), ART for nonpregnant HIV-infected adults and postpubertal adolescents, and ARV prophylaxis for those who experienceoccupational or nonoccupational exposure to HIV. These guidelines are also available on the AIDS info website (http://aidsinfo.nih.gov ). Update plan The Panel meets monthly by teleconference to review data that may warrant modification of theguidelines. Updates may be prompted by new drug approvals (or new indications, formulations, orfrequency of dosing), new significant safety or efficacy data, or other information that may have asignificant impact on the clinical care of patients. In the event of significant new data that may affectpatient safety, the Panel may issue a warning announcement and post accompanyingrecommendations on the AIDS infowebsite until the guidelines can be updated with appropriate changes. Public comments A 2-week public comment period follows release of the updated guidelines on the AIDS infowebsite. The Panel reviews comments received to determine whether additional revisions to the guidelinesare indicated. The public may also submit comments to the Panel at any time atcontactus@aidsinfo.nih.gov .Guidelines Development Process Table 1. Outline of the Guidelines Development Process, cont'd Basis for Recommendations Recommendations in these guidelines are based upon scientific evidence and expert opinion. Each recommendation includes a letter (A, B, or C) that represents the strength of the recommendation and aRoman numeral (I, II, or III) that represents the quality of the evidence that supports the recommendation. Because licensure of drugs in children often is based on efficacy data from adult trials in addition to safety and PK data in children, recommendations for ARV drugs may need to rely, in part, on data from clinicaltrials or studies in adults. Pediatric drug approval may be based on evidence from adequate and well-controlled investigations in adults if: (1) The course of the disease and the effects of the drug in the pediatric and adult populations are expected to be similar enough to permit extrapolation of adult efficacy data to pediatric patients; (2) Supplemental data exist on PKs of the drug in children indicating that systemic exposure in adults and children are similar; and (3) Studies are provided that support the safety of the drug in pediatric patients. 7 Studies relating activity of the drug to drug levels (pharmacodynamic data) in children also should be available if there is a concern that concentration-response relationships might be different in children.In many cases, evidence related to use of ARV drugs is substantially greater from adult studies (especially randomized clinical trials) than from pediatric studies. Therefore, for pediatric recommendations, the following rationale has been used when the quality of evidence from pediatric studies is limited: Quality of Evidence Rating I\u2014Randomized Clinical Trial Data. In the absence of large pediatric randomized trials, adult data may be used if there are substantial pediatric data consistent with high-quality adult studies.mQuality of Evidence Rating I will be used if there are data from large randomized trials in children with clinical and/or validated laboratory endpoints. mQuality of Evidence Rating I* will be used if there are high-quality randomized clinical trial data in adults with clinical and/or validated laboratory endpoints and pediatric data from well- designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomesthat are consistent with the adult studies. A rating of I* may be used for quality of evidence if, forexample, a randomized Phase III clinical trial in adults demonstrates a drug is effective in ARV-naive patients and data from a nonrandomized pediatric trial demonstrate adequate and consistentsafety and PK data in the pediatric population. Quality of Evidence Rating II\u2014Nonrandomized Clinical Trials or Observational Cohort Data.In the absence of large, well-designed, pediatric, nonrandomized trials or observational data, adult datamay be used if there are sufficient pediatric data consistent with high-quality adult studies. mQuality of Evidence Rating II will be used if there are data from well-designed nonrandomizedtrials or observational cohorts in children . mQuality of Evidence Rating II* will be used if there are well-designed nonrandomized trials orobservational cohort studies in adults with supporting and consistent information from smaller nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data in children. A rating of II* may beused for quality of evidence if, for example, a large observational study in adults demonstratesclinical benefit to initiating treatment at a certain CD4 cell count and data from smaller observationalstudies in children indicate that a similar CD4 count is associated with clinical benefit. Quality of Evidence Rating III\u2014Expert opinion.The criteria do not differ for adults and children. Table 2.

Prenatal HIV testing and counseling should be the standard of care for all pregnant women in the United States.8Identification of HIV-infected women before or during pregnancy is critical to providing optimal therapy to both infected women and their infants and to reducing perinatal transmission. Access to prenatal care is essential for all pregnant women. Enrollment of pregnant HIV-infected women, their HIV-exposed newborns, and infected infants, children, and adolescents into clinical trials offers the best means of determining safe and effective therapies. The pharmaceutical industry and the federal government should continue collaborating to ensure that drug formulations suitable for administration to infants and children are available for all ARV drugsproduced. Some information about the efficacy of ARV drugs for children can be extrapolated from clinical trials involving adults, but concurrent clinical trials in children are needed to determine the impact of thedrug on specific manifestations of HIV infection in children, including growth, development, andneurologic disease. However, the absence of Phase III efficacy trials addressing pediatric-specificmanifestations of HIV infection does not preclude the use of any approved ARV drug in children. Treatment of HIV infection in infants, children, and adolescents is rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly complex; therefore, wherever possible, their treatment should be managed by a specialistin pediatric and adolescent HIV infection. If that is not possible, such experts should be consulted. Effective management of the complex and diverse needs of HIV-infected infants, children, adolescents, and their families generally requires a multidisciplinary team approach that includesphysicians, nurses, nutritionists, pharmacists, dentists, psychologists, social workers, child lifespecialists, and outreach workers. Health care providers contemplating use of ARV drugs to treat infants, children, or adolescents should consider certain factors that influence adherence to therapy, including: mavailability and palatability of drug formulations; mimpact of the medication schedule on quality of life, including number of medications,frequency of administration, ability to coadminister with other prescribed medications, andneed to take with or without food; mability of the children's caregiver or the adolescents themselves to administer complex drugregimens and availability of resources that might be effective in facilitating adherence; and mpotential for drug interactions. The choice of initial ARV regimen should include consideration of factors that may limit future treatment options, such as the presence of or potential for development of resistance to ARV drugs. HIV resistance assays have proven useful in guiding initial therapy and in changing failing regimens, but expert clinical interpretation is required. Monitoring of growth and development, short- and long-term drug toxicities, neurodevelopment, symptom management, and nutrition is essential in the care of HIV-infected children because those factors may significantly influence quality of life. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection A-5 In areas where enrollment in clinical trials is possible, enrollment of children in available trials should be discussed with the children's caregivers.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection A-6Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection B-1Identification of Perinatal HIV Exposure (Last updated November 1, 2012; last reviewed November 1, 2012) To treat HIV-infected infants appropriately, HIV-exposed infants must be identified as soon as possible, and that is best accomplished by identifying HIV-infected women before or during pregnancy. Universal HIV counseling and voluntary HIV testing, including consent using an opt-out approach, are recommended as the standard of care for all pregnant women in the United States by the Panel, the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS), the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.1-6All HIV testing should be performed in a manner consistent with state and local laws (http://www.nccc.ucsf.edu/consultation_library/state_hiv_testing_laws/ ). Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the \"opt-out\" approach, which involves notifying pregnant women that HIV testing will be performed as part of routine care unless they choose not to be tested for HIV .7The \"opt-in\" approach involves obtaining specific signed consent before testing and has been associated with lower testing rates. The mandatory newborn HIV testing approach involves testing of newborns for perinatal HIV exposure with or without maternal consent.7Panel's Recommendations HIV testing early in pregnancy is recommended as standard of care for all pregnant women in the United States (AII) . Repeat HIV testing in the third trimester should be considered for all HIV-seronegative pregnant women and is recommended for pregnant women who are at high risk of HIV infection (such as those with a known HIV-infected partner, personal or partner history of injection drug use, diagnosis with a sexually transmitted disease [STD], signs orsymptoms of acute HIV infection or who reside in a high-prevalence area) (AIII) . Rapid HIV antibody testing at the time of labor or delivery should be performed on women with undocumented HIV status, and intrapartum antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis should be initiated in those who test positive (AII) . For pregnant women who are suspected to have acute HIV infection, a virologic test such as a plasma HIV RNA assay should be performed because serologic testing may be negative at this early stage of infection (AII) . Women who have not been tested for HIV before or during labor should undergo rapid HIV antibody testing during the immediate postpartum period or their newborns should undergo rapid HIV antibody testing. If results in mother or infantare positive, infant ARV prophylaxis should be initiated as soon as possible and the mothers should not breastfeed unlessconfirmatory HIV antibody testing is negative (AII) . Results of maternal HIV testing should be documented in the newborn's medical record and communicated to the newborn's primary care provider (AIII) . Infant HIV antibody testing to determine HIV exposure should be considered for infants in foster care and adoptees for whom maternal HIV infection status is unknown (AIII) . Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in childrenwith long-term outcomes; II* = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adults with long-term clinical outcomes with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = expert opinion Studies that include children or children and adolescents but not studies limited to postpubertal adolescentsEarly identification of HIV-infected women is crucial for their health and for the care of their children, whether the children are infected or not. Knowledge of antenatal maternal HIV infection enables: HIV-infected women to receive appropriate antiretroviral therapy (ART) and prophylaxis against opportunistic infections for their own health; Provision of antiretroviral (ARV) chemoprophylaxis during pregnancy, during labor, and to the newborn to reduce the risk of HIV transmission from mother to child;8 Counseling of HIV-infected women about the indications for and potential benefits of scheduled cesarean delivery to reduce perinatal transmission of HIV;8-12 Counseling of HIV-infected women about the risks of HIV transmission through breast milk and that breastfeeding is not recommended for HIV-infected women living in the United States and othercountries where safe alternatives to breast milk are available; 13 Initiation of prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) in all HIV-exposed infants with indeterminate HIV infection status or who have documented HIV infection beginning at age 4 to6 weeks; 14and Early diagnostic evaluation of HIV-exposed infants to permit early initiation of ART in infected infants.2, 15 Repeat HIV Testing in the Third Trimester Repeat HIV testing should be considered for all HIV-seronegative pregnant women. It is recommended in thethird trimester, preferably before 36 weeks' gestation, for women with initially negative HIV antibody tests whoare at high risk of HIV infection. 16A second HIV test during the third trimester is recommended for women who: Are receiving health care in a jurisdiction that has a high incidence of HIV or AIDS in women between ages 15 and 45 or are receiving health care in facilities in which prenatal screening identifies at least 1HIV-infected pregnant woman per 1,000 women screened; Are known to be at high risk of acquiring HIV (such as those who are injection drug users or partners of injection drug users, exchange sex for money or drugs, are sex partners of HIV-infected persons, havehad a new or more than 1 sex partner during current pregnancy, or have been diagnosed with a newsexually transmitted disease during pregnancy); or Have signs or symptoms of acute HIV infection. 5, 6, 17 Women who decline testing earlier in pregnancy should be offered testing again during the third trimester. Thereis evidence that for women, the risk of HIV acquisition is significantly higher during pregnancy than in the postpartum period. 18If acute HIV infection is suspected, virologic testing with a plasma HIV RNA assay or other virologic assay should be performed because serologic testing may be negative at this early stage of infection.19 Rapid HIV Testing During Labor in Women with Unknown HIV Status Use of rapid test kits or an expedited enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect HIV antibodies is recommended to screen women seen at labor whose HIV status is undocumented and identify HIV exposure in their infants.2, 5, 6, 15Any hospital offering intrapartum care should have rapid HIV testing available and should have in place policies and procedures to ensure that staff are prepared to provide patient education about rapid HIV testing, that appropriate ARV medications are available whenever needed, and that follow-up procedures are in place for women found to be HIV-infected and their infants. Rapid tests have been found to be feasible, accurate, timely, and useful both in ensuring prompt initiation of intrapartum and neonatal ARV prophylaxis and in reducing perinatal transmission of HIV .20Results of rapid tests can be obtained within minutes to a few hours Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection B-2Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection B-3and are as accurate as standard ELISA antibody testing.21, 22A positive rapid HIV test result must be followed by a confirmatory test such as a Western blot or immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) assay; a standard ELISA should not be used as a confirmatory test for a rapid HIV antibody test.22A single negative rapid test does not need confirmation unless acute HIV infection is suspected, in which case, a virologic test is necessary.19Immediate initiation of ARV prophylaxis for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV is stronglyrecommended pending confirmation of an initial positive rapid HIV test. 2, 4, 8, 15 HIV Counseling and Testing During the Postnatal Period Women who have not been tested for HIV before or during labor should be offered rapid testing during theimmediate postpartum period or their newborns should undergo rapid HIV antibody testing, with maternalcounseling and consent unless state law allows testing without consent. 2, 6, 8, 15Use of rapid HIV antibody assays or expedited ELISA for prompt identification of HIV-exposed infants is essential because neonatal ARVchemoprophylaxis should be initiated as soon as possible after birth\u2014and no more than 12 hours later\u2014to beeffective for PMTCT. 23, 24When an initial rapid test is positive in mother or infant, initiation of infant ARV prophylaxis and counseling against initiation of breastfeeding is strongly recommended pending results ofconfirmatory tests. 8If the confirmatory test is negative and acute HIV infection is excluded, infant ARV prophylaxis can be discontinued and breastfeeding can be initiated. Mechanisms should be developed tofacilitate rapid HIV screening for infants who have been abandoned and are in the custody of the state. Infant HIV Testing When Maternal HIV Test Results Are Unavailable When maternal HIV test results are unavailable (such as for infants who are in foster care)25or their accuracy cannot be evaluated (such as for infants adopted from a different country whose results are not reported inEnglish), HIV antibody testing is indicated to identify HIV exposure in the infant. If antibody testing is positive,further testing is needed to diagnose HIV infection (see Diagnosis of HIV infection in Infants ). Acute Maternal HIV Infection During Pregnancy Or Breastfeeding The risk of mother-to-child HIV transmission is increased in infants born to women who have acute HIVinfection during pregnancy or lactation. 26-28When acute retroviral syndrome is suspected in pregnancy or during breastfeeding, maternal testing should include a plasma HIV RNA test in addition to an HIV antibody test,because HIV antibody testing may be negative in early maternal infection. Women with suspected acute HIVinfection who are breastfeeding should stop breastfeeding until HIV infection is confirmed or excluded.Pumping and temporarily discarding breast milk can be recommended and, if HIV infection is excluded,breastfeeding can resume. Care of pregnant or breastfeeding women and their infants identified with acute orearly HIV infection should follow guidelines in Recommendations for Use of Antiretroviral Drugs in Pregnant HIV-1-Infected Women for Maternal Health and Interventions to Reduce Perinatal HIV Transmission in the United States .8 References 1.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection B-5Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection C-1Diagnosis of HIV Infection in Infants and Children (Last updated November 1, 2012; last reviewed November 1, 2012) Diagnostic Testing in Infants with Perinatal HIV-1 (HIV) Exposure HIV infection can be definitively diagnosed through use of virologic assays in most nonbreastfed HIV-exposed infants by 1 month of age and in virtually all infected infants by 4 months of age. Tests for antibodies to HIV , including newer rapid tests, do not establish the presence of HIV infection in infants because of transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies to HIV; therefore a virologic test should be used.1, 2A positive virologic test (that is, detection of HIV by DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or RNA assays) indicates likely HIV infection. The first test result should be confirmed as soon as possible by a repeat virologic test on a second specimen because false-positive results can occur with both RNA and DNA assays. HIV culture is not used for routine HIV diagnostic testing, although it has a sensitivity similar to that of HIV DNA PCR.3It is more complex and expensive to perform than DNA PCR or RNA assays and may require 2 to 4 weeks for definitive results; it is generally not available outside of research laboratories. Use of the currently approved HIV p24 antigen assay is not recommended for infant diagnosis in the United States because the sensitivity and specificity of the assay in the first months of life are less than that of other HIVPanel's Recommendations Virologic assays that directly detect HIV must be used to diagnose HIV infection in infants younger than 18 months (AII). Virologic diagnostic testing in infants with known perinatal HIV exposure is recommended at ages 14 to 21 days, 1 to 2 months, and 4 to 6 months (AII). Virologic diagnostic testing at birth should be considered for infants at high risk of HIV infection (BIII). HIV DNA polymerase chain reaction and HIV RNA assays are recommended as preferred virologic assays (AII). A positive virologic test should be confirmed as soon as possible by a repeat virologic test on a second specimen (AII). Definitive exclusion of HIV infection in nonbreastfed infants is based on two or more negative virologic tests, with one obtained at 1 month of age and one at 4 months of age, or two negative HIV antibody tests from separate specimens obtained at 6 months of age (AII). Some experts confirm the absence of HIV infection at 12 to 18 months of age in infants with prior negative virologic tests by performing an antibody test to document loss of maternal HIV antibodies (BIII). HIV antibody assays alone can be used for diagnosis of HIV infection in children with perinatal exposure who are 18 months of age and in children with non-perinatal exposure (see text for exceptions) (AII). Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in childrenwith long-term outcomes; II* = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adults with long-term clinical outcomes with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = expert opinion Studies that include children or children and adolescents but not studies limited to postpubertal adolescentsvirologic tests.4, 5 An infant who is found to have positive HIVantibody on screening but whose mother's HIV status is unknown (see Identification of Perinatal HIV Exposure), should be assumed to be HIV-exposed and undergo the HIVdiagnostic testing described here. HIV DNA PCR HIV DNA PCR is a sensitive technique used to detect specific HIV viral DNA in peripheral bloodmononuclear cells (PBMCs). The specificity of the HIV DNA PCR is 99.8% at birth and 100% at 1, 3, and 6months. The sensitivity of the test performed at birth is 55% but increases to more than 90% by 2 to 4 weeksof age, and 100% at 3 months and 6 months of age. 6-8 HIV RNA Assays HIV quantitative RNA assays detect extracellular viral RNA in the plasma. Their specificity (for results5,000 copies/mL) has been shown to be 100% at birth, 1, 3, and 6 months of age and is comparable to HIVDNA PCR. 8HIV RNA levels <5,000 copies/mL may not be reproducible and should be repeated before they are interpreted as documenting HIV infection in an infant. The sensitivity of HIV RNA assays has beenshown to be 25% to 58% during the first weeks of life, 89% at 1 month of age, and increases to 90% to 100%by 2 to 3 months of age. 6-11HIV RNA assays are as sensitive as HIV DNA PCR for early diagnosis of HIV infection in HIV-exposed infants. An HIV RNA assay can be used as the confirmatory test for infants whohave an initial positive HIV DNA PCR test. In addition to providing virologic confirmation of infectionstatus, the expense of repeat HIV DNA PCR testing is spared and an HIV RNA measurement is available toassess baseline viral load. HIV RNA assays may be more sensitive than HIV DNA PCR for detecting HIVnon-subtype B (see HIV subtype section below). It is established that HIV DNA PCR remains positive evenin individuals receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). 12However, RNA assays can be affected by maternal antenatal therapy with combination antiretroviral (ARV) drugs and/or infant ARVprophylaxis. Among a group of 47 infants who received zidovudine prophylaxis, HIV RNA levels werelower at 1 month of age compared with levels at 3 months of age (median of 5.1 vs. 5.6 logs) and among 9infants who received combination ARV prophylaxis, the median was 2.5 logs at 1 month of age. However,prenatal and neonatal combination ARV regimens did not affect the sensitivity of the assay to detect thepresence of HIV . 8 The HIV qualitative RNA assay (APTIMA HIV-1 RNA Qualitative Assay) is an alternative diagnostic testthat can be used for infant testing. 13-17 Issues Related to Diagnosis of Non-Subtype B HIV-1 Infections Although HIV-1 subtype B is the predominant viral subtype found in the United States, non-subtype B viruses predominate in some other parts of the world, such as subtype C in regions of Africa and India and subtype CRF01 in much of Southeast Asia.18-20Currently available HIV DNA PCR tests have decreased sensitivity for detection of non-subtype B HIV , and false-negative HIV DNA PCR test results have been reported in infants infected with non-subtype B HIV .21-24In an evaluation of perinatally infected infants diagnosed in New York State in 2001-2002, 16.7% of infants were infected with a non-subtype B strain of HIV , compared with 4.4% of infants diagnosed between 1998 and 1999.25 Some currently available HIV RNA assays have improved sensitivity for detection of non-subtype B HIV infection,26-31although even these assays may not detect or properly quantify some non-B subtypes, particularly the more uncommon group O HIV subtypes.28, 32, 33 When evaluating an infant whose mother or father (or both) comes from an area endemic for non-subtype B HIV , such as Africa and Southeast Asia, clinicians should consider conducting initial testing using one of the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection C-2Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection C-3assays more sensitive for non-subtype B virus.28, 34In addition, when non-subtype B perinatal exposure is suspected in infants with negative HIV DNA PCR results, repeat testing using one of the newer RNA assays is recommended. In these situations, the clinician should consult with an expert in pediatric HIV infection.The child should undergo close clinical monitoring and HIV serologic testing at age 18 months todefinitively rule out HIV infection. Issues Related to Diagnosis of HIV-2 Infections HIV-2 infection is endemic in Angola; Mozambique;West African countries including Cape Verde, IvoryCoast, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Ghana,Guinea, Liberia, Niger, Nigeria, Sao Tome, Senegal, and Togo; and in parts of India. 35, 36It also occurs in countries such as France and Portugal, which have large numbers of immigrants from these regions;37HIV-2 is rare in the United States. HIV-2 infection should be suspected in pregnant women who are from\u2014or whohave partners from\u2014countries in which the disease is endemic, who are HIV-1 antibody positive on an initialenzyme-linked immunoassay screening test, and who have repeatedly indeterminate results on HIV-1Western blot and HIV-1 RNA viral loads at or below the limit of detection. 38This pattern of HIV testing can also be seen in patients who have a false-positive HIV-1 test. HIV-1 and HIV-2 coinfections may also occurfurther complicating the diagnosis. The majority of commercially available HIV screening antibody tests can detect both HIV-1 and HIV-2 but cannot distinguish between the two viruses. The only Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approvedantibody test that distinguishes between HIV-1 and HIV-2 is the Bio-Rad Laboratories Multispot HIV-1/HIV-2 test. If HIV-2 is suspected, infection can be confirmed using a supplemental test such as an HIV-2immunoblot or HIV-2-specific Western blot. HIV-2 immunoblots are available through commercial labs;however, none are FDA-approved for HIV-2 diagnosis. All HIV-2 cases should be reported to the HIVsurveillance program of the state or local health department, which can arrange for additional confirmatorytesting for HIV-2 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Infants born to HIV-2-infected mothers should be tested for HIV-2 infection with HIV-2-specific virologic assays (HIV-2 DNA PCR testing) at time points similar to those used for HIV-1 testing. HIV-2 virologicassays are not commercially available, but the National Perinatal HIV Hotline (1-888-448-8765) can providea list of sites that perform this testing. Clinicians should consult with an expert in pediatric HIV infection ifcaring for infants with suspected or known exposure to HIV-2. 36, 39, 40 Timing of Diagnostic Testing in Infants with Known Perinatal HIV Exposure Virologic diagnostic testing of the HIV-exposed infant should be performed at age 14 to 21 days, at age 1 to2 months, and at age 4 to 6 months. Virologic diagnostic testing at birth should be considered for infants at high risk of HIV infection (see below). Confirmation of HIV infection should be based on two positive virologic tests from separate blood samples, regardless of a child's age. A positive HIV antibody test with confirmatory Western blot (or immunofluorescent antibody [IFA] assay) at age 18 months confirms HIV infection, except in rare late seroreverters (see Diagnostic Testing in Exceptional Situations section below). 1 HIV infection can be presumptively excluded in non-breastfed infants with two or more negative virologic tests, with one test obtained at 14 days of age and one obtained at 4 weeks of age, or one negative virologic test obtained at 8 weeks of age, or one negative HIV antibody test obtained at 6 months of age.1, 41 Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis is recommended for infants with indeterminate HIV infection status starting at 4 to 6 weeks of age until they are determined to be HIV uninfected or presumptively uninfected with HIV .42, 43Thus, initiation of PCP prophylaxis can be avoided or, if prophylaxis was initiated, can be stopped, if an infant has negative virologic tests at 2 weeks of age and at 4 weeks of age, or if virologicGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection C-4testing is negative at 8 weeks of age. Definitive exclusion of HIV infection in a non-breastfed infant is based on 2 or more negative virologic tests, with one obtained at 1 month of age and one at 4 months of age, or 2 negative HIV antibody tests from separate specimens obtained at 6 months of age. For both presumptive and definitive exclusion of HIV infection, a child must have no other laboratory (meaning, no positive virologic test results or low CD4 Tlymphocyte [CD4 cell] count/percent) or clinical evidence of HIV infection and not be breastfeeding. Manyexperts confirm the absence of HIV infection in infants with negative virologic tests by performing anantibody test at 12 to 18 months of age to document seroreversion to HIV antibody negative status. Virologic Testing at Birth (Optional) Virologic testing at birth can be considered for newborns at high risk of HIV infection, such as infants bornto HIV-infected mothers who did not receive prenatal care or prenatal antiretroviral therapy (ART), werediagnosed with acute HIV infection during pregnancy, or who had HIV viral loads 1,000 copies/mL close tothe time of delivery. As many as 30% to 40% of HIV-infected infants can be identified by 48 hours of age. 7 Blood samples from the umbilical cord should not be used for diagnostic evaluations because of the potentialfor contamination with maternal blood. Working definitions have been proposed to differentiate acquisitionof HIV infection during the intrauterine period from the intrapartum period. Infants who have a positivevirologic test at or before age 48 hours are considered to have early (that is, intrauterine) infection, whereasinfants who have a negative virologic test during the first week of life and subsequent positive tests areconsidered to have late (that is, intrapartum) infection. 44Some researchers have proposed that infants with early infection may have more rapid disease progression than those with late infection and, therefore, shouldreceive more aggressive therapy. 44, 45However, data from prospective cohort studies have demonstrated that although early differences in HIV RNA levels were present between infants with a positive HIV culturewithin 48 hours of birth and those with a first positive culture after 7 days of age, these differences were nolonger statistically significant after 2 months of age. 46HIV RNA levels after the first month of life were more predictive of rapid disease progression than the time at which HIV culture tests were positive.46 Virologic Testing at Age 14 Days to 21 Days The diagnostic sensitivity of virologic testing increases rapidly by age 2 weeks,7and early identification of infection would permit discontinuation of neonatal ARV prophylaxis and further evaluation for initiation ofcombination ART (see When to Initiate Therapy in Antiretroviral-Naive HIV-Infected Infants Younger than 12 Months and Table 7 ). Virologic Testing at Age 1 to 2 Months Infants with negative virologic tests before 1 month of age should be retested at 1 to 2 months of age. Most HIV-exposed neonates will receive 6 weeks of neonatal ARV prophylaxis. Although ARV agents, in theory, could affect the predictive value of HIV virologic testing in neonates, use of prenatal/intrapartum/neonatal zidovudine single-drug prophylaxis did not delay detection of HIV by culture in infants in Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) protocol 076 and has not decreased the sensitivity and predictive values of many virologic assays.9-11, 41, 47, 48In one study, prenatal and neonatal combination ARV regimens lowered HIV RNA levels for HIV-exposed infected infants but did not affect the assay's sensitivity for detecting the presence of HIV (that is, HIV RNA levels remained detectable).8Further studies are necessary to confirm this finding. An infant with two negative virologic tests, one at 14 days and one at 1 month of age, can be viewed as presumptively uninfected and would not need PCP prophylaxis, assuming the child has no laboratory (such as, no positive virologic test results or low CD4 cell count) or clinical evidence of HIV infection.Virologic Testing at Age 4 to 6 Months HIV-exposed children who have had negative virologic assays at 14 to 21 days of age and at 1 to 2 months of age, have no clinical evidence of HIV infection, and are not breastfed should be retested at 4 to 6 months of agefor definitive exclusion of HIV infection. Antibody Testing at Age 6 Months or Older Two or more negative HIV antibody tests performed in non-breastfed infants at 6 months of age can also beused to definitively exclude HIV infection in HIV-exposed children with no clinical or virologic laboratory evidence of HIV infection. Antibody Testing at Age 12 to 18 Months to Document Seroreversion If there has not been previous confirmation of two negative antibody tests, many experts confirm the absenceof HIV infection in infants with negative virologic tests by repeat serologic testing between 12 and 18months of age to confirm that maternal HIV antibodies transferred in utero have disappeared. The proportion of infants who serorevert by 15 to 18 months of age is close to 100%, with as many as 95% seroreverting by12 months of age. Factors that might influence the time to seroreversion include maternal disease stage andassay sensitivity. 1, 49-52 Diagnostic Testing in Children with Perinatal HIV Exposure in Exceptional Situations Late seroreversion up to 24 months of age Postnatal HIV infection in HIV-exposed children with prior negative virologic tests for whom there are additional HIV transmission risks HIV-2 and non-subtype B HIV-1 On rare occasions, non-breastfed perinatally HIV-exposed infants with no other HIV transmission risk and no clinical or virologic laboratory evidence of HIV infection may have residual HIV antibodies for up to 24months (these infants are called late seroreverters). 52-54These children may have positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA) results but indeterminate confirmatory antibody tests (Western Blot or IFA). Insuch cases, repeat antibody testing at a later time would document seroreversion. In contrast to late seroreverters, in rare situations, postnatal HIV infections have been reported in HIV- exposed infants who had prior negative HIV virologic tests. This occurs in infants who become infectedthrough an additional risk after completion of testing (see Diagnostic Testing in Children with Non-Perinatal HIV Exposure section below). If a confirmatory HIV antibody test is positive at 18 months of age, repeated virologic testing will distinguish between residual antibodies in uninfected, late seroreverting children and true infection. Postnatal HIV exposure can occur if an HIV-infected mother breastfeeds her infant. Typical scenarios in the US include women who have not been adequately counseled about infant feeding, women who breastfeed despite being counseled not to do so, and women who learn of their HIV diagnosis only after initiating breastfeeding. Diagnostic testing to rule out acquisition of HIV through breast milk will only be accurate after breastfeeding has completely ceased. The timing of testing in such situations is discussed below in Diagnostic Testing in Children with Non-Perinatal HIV Exposure . Another example where there can be postnatal HIV exposure is when an HIV-infected caregiver premasticates or prechews solid food before feeding it to an infant. This practice has been documented to result in HIV transmission.53, 54In such exposed children, both screening EIA and confirmatory antibody tests (EIA, Western Blot or IFA) may be positive at 18 months. Another study documented very rare cases of late postnatal infection without identified risk factors, suggesting the possibility of intrafamilial HIV transmission.55 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection C-5Children with non-subtype B HIV-1 infection and children with HIV-2 infection may have persistent positive EIA tests and indeterminate confirmatory antibody tests.21-24Situations in which such infections may be suspected and the diagnostic approach to them are discussed above in the sections Issues Related to Diagnosis of Non-Subtype B Infection and Issues Related to Diagnosis of HIV-2 Infection . Diagnostic Testing in Children with Non-Perinatal HIV Exposure Breastfeeding is a known route of HIV transmission. Infants who are breastfed by an HIV-infected woman,including those diagnosed with acute HIV infection during breastfeeding or who breastfed before knowingtheir HIV diagnosis, should undergo immediate HIV virologic testing and breastfeeding should bediscontinued. Follow-up virologic testing should be performed at 4 to 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months afterbreastfeeding cessation if the initial tests are negative. 56HIV antibody testing of an infant to assess for HIV exposure would not be helpful if the mother acquired HIV infection after giving birth. In that situation, aninfant would be HIV antibody-negative but still at risk of acquiring HIV infection through breastfeeding andcounseling to cease breastfeeding should be provided. Perinatal HIV acquisition accounts for the majority of HIV infections in children, but providers may need to evaluate children exposed to HIV through other routes, such as sexual abuse, or because they were adoptedfrom countries in which parenteral exposure to HIV via contaminated blood products is a possibility. In suchcases, maternal HIV status may be negative or unknown. Receipt of solid food premasticated or prechewedby an HIV-infected caregiver also has been documented to be associated with risk of HIV transmission. 53, 54 Finally, acquisition of HIV is possible through accidental needle sticks or behavioral risks, such as sexualactivity or injection drug use in older children. HIV antibody testing should be performed on children who are suspected to have HIV infection because of clinical or laboratory findings consistent with HIV . Additional virologic testing may be necessary if acuteHIV infection or end-stage AIDS is suspected because antibody testing can be negative in these situations. References 1.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection C-10Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection D-1Laboratory Monitoring of Pediatric HIV Infection Prior to Therapy Initiation (Last updated November 1, 2012; last reviewed November 1, 2012) Immunologic Monitoring in Children Clinicians interpreting CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4 cell) counts in children must consider age as a factor. CD4 cell count and percentage values in healthy infants who are HIV-uninfected are considerably higher thanvalues observed in uninfected adults and slowly decline to adult values by age 5 years. 1, 2In children younger than age 5 years, the absolute CD4 cell count tends to vary more with age than does CD4 percentage. Therefore, in HIV-infected children younger than age 5 years, CD4 percentage has generally been preferred for monitoring immune status, whereas absolute CD4 cell count has been the preferred option and is used for children 5 years and can be used in younger children if CD4 percentage is not available.3-5However, an analysis from the HIV Paediatric Prognostic Markers Collaborative Study (HPPMCS) found that CD4 percentage provided little or no additional prognostic value compared with absolute CD4 cell regarding short-term disease progression in children <5 years as well as in older children.6Therefore, the pediatric guidelines include CD4 cell count thresholds as well as CD4 percentage thresholds for initiation of treatment in all children >12 months of age. In the case of discordance between CD4 percentage and absolute CD4 cell count, treatment decisions should be based on the lower value.6 In HIV-infected children, as in infected adults, the CD4 cell count and percentage decline as HIV infection progresses, and patients with lower CD4 values have a poorer prognosis than patients with higher values (Tables 3-5 ). Consequently, CD4 values should be obtained as soon as possible after a child has a positivePanel's Recommendations The age of the child must be considered when interpreting the risk of disease progression based on CD4 percentage or CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4 cell) count and plasma HIV RNA level (AII). For any given CD4 percentage and count, younger children, especially those in the first year of life, face higher risk of progression than do older children (AII). In children younger than 5 years of age, CD4 percentage is generally preferred for monitoring immune status because of age-related changes in absolute CD4 cell count in this age group although absolute CD4 count may also be used (AII). CD4 percentage and/or CD4 cell count should be measured at the time of diagnosis of HIV infection and at least every 3 to 4 months thereafter (AIII). Plasma HIV RNA should be measured to assess viral load at the time of diagnosis of HIV infection and at least every 3 to 4 months thereafter (AIII). More frequent CD4 cell and plasma HIV RNA monitoring should be considered in children with suspected clinical, immunologic, or virologic deterioration or to confirm an abnormal value (AIII). Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in childrenwith long-term outcomes; II* = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adults with long-term clinical outcomes with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = expert opinion Studies that include children or children and adolescents but not studies limited to postpubertal adolescentstest for HIV and every 3 to 4 months thereafter. Less frequent monitoring has been proposed for adults with high CD4 cell counts, but this has not been modeled for children in whom the risk of disease progressionmay differ substantially. 7More frequent evaluation may be needed for children with suspected clinical, immunologic, or virologic deterioration; to confirm an abnormal value; or when initiating or changingtherapy. Because of the risk of rapid progression, initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is nowrecommended for all HIV-infected infants younger than age 12 months 8, 9(see When to Initiate Therapy in Antiretroviral-Naive Children ). The prognostic value of CD4 percentage and HIV RNA copy number was assessed in a large individualpatient meta-analysis (HPPMCS), which incorporated clinical and laboratory data from 17 pediatric studiesand included 3,941 HIV-infected children receiving either no therapy or only zidovudine monotherapy. 4The analysis looked at the short-term (12-month) risk of developing AIDS or dying based on the child's age andselected values of CD4 percentage and HIV RNA copy number at baseline. Figures 1 and 2 and Table 3 depict age-associated 1-year risk of developing AIDS or dying as a function of CD4 percentage. In a separateanalysis of this data set, predictive value of absolute CD4 cell count for risk of death or AIDS/death in HIV-infected children age 5 years or older was similar to that observed in young adults, with an increase in therisk of mortality when CD4 cell count fell below 350 cells/mm 3(Table 4 and Figure 3 ).3, 10 The risk of disease progression associated with a specific CD4 percentage or count varies with the age of thechild. Infants in the first year of life experience higher risks of progression or death than older children for anygiven CD4 stratum. For example, comparing a 1-year-old child with a CD4 percentage of 25% to a 5-year-oldchild with the same CD4 percentage, there is an approximately fourfold increase in the risk of AIDS andsixfold increase in the risk of death in the 1-year-old child (Figures 1 and 2 ). Children aged 5 years or older have a lower risk of progression than younger children, with the increase in risk of AIDS or deathcorresponding to absolute CD4 levels more similar to those in young adults (Figure 3 ). In the HPPMCS, there were no deaths among children 5 years of age or older with CD4 cell counts >350 cells/mm3, although in younger children there continued to be a significant risk of death even with CD4 cell counts >500 cells/mm3 (Table 4 ). These risk profiles form the rationale for recommendations on when to initiate therapy in a treatment-naiveHIV-infected child (see When to Initiate Therapy in Antiretroviral-Naive Children ). A website using the meta-analysis from the HPPMCS is available to estimate the short-term risk of progression to AIDS or deathin the absence of effective ART according to age and the most recent CD4 percentage/absolute CD4 cellcount or HIV-1 RNA viral load measurement (http://hppmcs.org ).4 Measurement of CD4 values can be associated with considerable intrapatient variation.5Even mild intercurrent illness or the receipt of vaccinations can produce a transient decrease in CD4 cell count andpercentage, thus, CD4 values are best measured when patients are clinically stable. No decision about therapy should be made in response to a change in CD4 values until the change has been substantiated by at least a second determination, with a minimum of 1 week between measurements. HIV RNA Monitoring in Children Viral burden in peripheral blood can be determined by using quantitative HIV RNA assays. During the period of primary infection in adults, HIV RNA copy number initially rises to high peak levels and then declines by as much as 2 to 3 log10copies to reach a stable lower level (the virologic set point) approximately 6 to 12 months after acute infection.11, 12In infected adults, the viral set point correlates with the subsequent risk of disease progression or death.13 The HIV RNA pattern in perinatally infected infants differs from that in infected adults and adolescents. High HIV RNA copy numbers persist in infected children for prolonged periods.14, 15In one prospective study, HIV RNA levels generally were low at birth (i.e., <10,000 copies/mL), increased to high values by age Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection D-2Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection D-32 months (most infants had values >100,000 copies/mL, ranging from undetectable to nearly 10 million copies/mL), and then decreased slowly; the mean HIV RNA level during the first year of life was 185,000copies/mL. 16In addition, in contrast to the adult pattern, after the first year of life, HIV RNA copy number slowly declines over the next few years.16-19This pattern probably reflects the lower efficiency of an immature but developing immune system in containing viral replication and possibly the rapid expansion ofHIV-susceptible cells that occurs with somatic growth. 20 HIV RNA levels (i.e., >299,000 copies/mL) in infants younger than age 12 months have been correlated withdisease progression and death, but RNA levels overlap considerably in young infants who have rapid diseaseprogression and those who do not. 14, 16RNA levels (that is, >100,000 copies/mL) in older children also have been associated with high risk of disease progression and mortality, particularly if CD4 percentage is <15%(Table 5 ).18, 19The most robust data set available to elucidate the predictive value of plasma RNA for disease progression in children was assembled in the HPPMCS (see Immunologic Monitoring in Children ).4As for CD4 percentage, analyses were performed for age-associated risk in the context of plasma RNA levels in acohort of children receiving either no therapy or only zidovudine monotherapy. Similar to data from previousstudies, 18, 19the risk of clinical progression to AIDS or death dramatically increases when HIV RNA exceeds 100,000 copies (5.0 log10copies)/mL; at lower values, only older children show much variation in risk (Figures 4 and 5 and Table 3 ). At any given level of HIV RNA, infants younger than 1 year of age were at higher risk of progression than older children, although these differences were less striking than thoseobserved for the CD4 percentage data. Despite data indicating that high plasma HIV RNA concentrations are associated with disease progression, the predictive value of specific HIV RNA concentrations for disease progression and death for an individualchild is moderate. 18HIV RNA concentration may be difficult to interpret during the first year of life because values are high and are less predictive of disease progression risk than in older children.15In both HIV- infected children and adults, CD4 percentage or count and HIV RNA copy number are independentpredictors of disease progression and mortality risk, and use of the two markers together more accuratelydefines prognosis. 18, 19, 21, 22 HIV RNA copy number should be assessed as soon as possible after a child has a positive virologic test forHIV and every 3 to 4 months thereafter; more frequent evaluation may be necessary for childrenexperiencing virologic, immunologic, or clinical deterioration or to confirm an abnormal value (seeManagement of Treatment-Experienced Infants, Children, and Adolescents ). Note that it is recommended that genotypic resistance testing be obtained before initiating ART and it is oftenperformed in this monitoring period before a child qualifies for therapy (see Monitoring of Children on Antiretroviral Therapy ). Methodological Considerations in Interpretation and Comparability of HIV RNA Assays The use of HIV RNA assays for clinical purposes requires specific considerations,23which are discussed more completely elsewhere.24Several different methods can be used for quantitating HIV RNA, each of which has a different level of sensitivity. Although the results of the assays are correlated, the absolute HIV RNA copy number obtained from a single specimen tested by two different assays can differ by twofold (0.3 log10copies/ mL) or more.25, 26 Six Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved viral load assays using one of four different methodologies currently exist: HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays: the Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor Test, version 1.5 (Roche Diagnostics), for which the lower limit of quantification differs between the \"ultrasensitive\" assay Test, including the COBAS automated format (Roche Diagnostics); and the Real Time HIV-1 Assay (Abbott Molecular Incorporated); nucleic acid sequence-based amplification HIV-1 HIV-1 branched chain nucleic acid probe assay (VERSANT Quantiplex HIV-1 RNA 3.0 Corporation); and Aptima HIV-1 RNA Qualitative assay (Gen-Probe Inc., San Diego, CA), primarily used for HIV diagnosis, as well as detection of less than full viral suppression during therapy. The lower limits of quantification of the assays differ (<40 copies/mL for the Abbott Real Time HIV-1 test, <48 copies/mL for the AmpliPrep/TaqMan HIV-1 Test, <50 copies/mL Use ofultrasensitive viral load assays is recommended to confirm that ART is producing maximal suppression ofviremia. Because of the variability among assays in techniques and quantitative HIV RNA measurements, ifpossible, a single HIV RNA assay method should be used consistently to monitor an individual patient. 27, 28 The predominant virus subtype in the United States is subtype B\u2014the subtype for which all initial assayswere targeted. Current kit configurations for all companies have been designed to detect and quantitateessentially all viral subtypes, with the exception of the uncommon O subtypes. 29,30This is important for many regions of the world where non-B subtypes are predominant as well as for the United States, where asmall subset of individuals are infected with non-B viral subtypes. 27, 31-35It is particularly relevant for children who are born outside the United States or to foreign-born parents. Choice of HIV RNA assay,particularly for young children, may be influenced by the amount of blood required for the assay. TheNucliSens assay requires the least blood (100 \u00b5L of plasma), followed by the RT-PCR assays such as theAmplicor HIV-1 Monitor (200 \u00b5L of plasma) and VERSANT assays (1 mL of plasma). Biologic variation in HIV RNA levels within one person is well documented. In adults, repeated measurementof HIV RNA levels using the same assay can vary by as much as threefold (0.5 log 10copies/mL) in either direction over the course of a day or on different days.21, 24, 26This biologic variation may be greater in infected infants and young children. In children with perinatally acquired HIV infection, RNA copy number slowlydeclines even without therapy during the first several years after birth, although it persists at higher levels thanthose observed in most infected adults. 16-18This decline is most rapid during the first 12 to 24 months after birth, with an average decline of approximately 0.6 log10copies/mL per year; a slower decline continues until approximately 4 to 5 years of age (average decline of 0.3 log10copies/mL per year). This inherent biologic variability must be considered when interpreting changes in RNA copy number inchildren. Thus, on repeated testing, only differences greater than fivefold (0.7 log 10copies/mL) in infants younger than age 2 years and greater than threefold (0.5 log10copies/mL) in children aged 2 years and older should be considered reflective of changes that are biologically and clinically substantial. No alteration in therapy should be made as a result of a change in HIV copy number unless the change is confirmed by a second measurement. Because of the complexities of HIV RNA testing and the age-related changes in HIV RNA in children, interpretation of HIV RNA levels for clinical decision making should be done by or in consultation with an expert in pediatric HIV infection.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection D-12Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection E-1Treatment Recommendations (Last updated November 1, 2012; last reviewed November 1, 2012) General Considerations Antiretroviral (ARV) treatment of pediatric HIV infection has steadily improved with the introduction of potent combination drug regimens that effectively suppress viral replication in most patients, resulting in alower risk of failure due to development of drug resistance. Currently, combination regimens including atleast three drugs from at least two drug classes are recommended; such regimens have been associated withenhanced survival, reduction in opportunistic infections and other complications of HIV infection, improvedgrowth and neurocognitive function, and improved quality of life in children. 1-5In the United States and the United Kingdom, significant declines (81%-93%) in mortality have been reported in HIV-infected childrenbetween 1994 and 2006, concomitant with increased use of highly active combination regimens; 6-8 significant declines in HIV-related morbidity and hospitalizations in children have been observed in theUnited States and Europe over the same time period. 4, 7 The increased survival of HIV-infected children is associated with challenges in selecting successive newARV drug regimens. Additionally, therapy is associated with short- and long-term toxicities, some of whichare only now beginning to be recognized in children. 9-11 (See Management of Medication Toxicity or Intolerance and Table 17 .) ARV drug-resistant virus can develop during combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) because of pooradherence, a regimen that is not potent, or a combination of these factors which results in incomplete viralsuppression. Additionally, primary drug resistance may be seen in ARV-naive children who have becomeinfected with a resistant virus. 12, 13Thus, decisions about when to start therapy and what drugs to choose in ARV-naive children and on how to best treat ARV-experienced children remain complex. Whenever possible,decisions regarding the management of pediatric HIV infection should be directed by or made in consultationwith a specialist in pediatric and adolescent HIV infection. Treatment of ARV-naive children (when and whatto start), when to change therapy, and treatment of ARV-experienced children will be discussed in separatesections of the guidelines. Several factors need to be considered in making decisions about initiating and changing ART in children, including: severity of HIV disease and risk of disease progression, as determined by age, presence or history of HIV-related or AIDS-defining illnesses (see pediatric clinical staging system for HIV , Table 6 ),14, 15 degree of CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4 cell) immunosuppression, and level of HIV plasma viremia; availability of appropriate (and palatable) drug formulations and pharmacokinetic (PK) information on appropriate dosing in a child's age group; potency, complexity (such as dosing frequency, food and fluid requirements), and potential short- and long-term adverse effects of the ARV regimen; effect of initial regimen choice on later therapeutic options; a child's ART history; presence of ARV drug-resistant virus; presence of comorbidity, such as tuberculosis, hepatitis B or C virus infection, or chronic renal or liver disease, that could affect drug choice; potential ARV drug interactions with other prescribed, over-the-counter, or complementary/alternative medications taken by a child; and the ability of the caregiver and child to adhere to the regimen. The following recommendations provide general guidance for decisions related to treatment of HIV-infected children, and flexibility should be exercised according to a child's individual circumstances. Guidelines fortreatment of HIV-infected children are evolving as new data from clinical trials become available. Althoughprospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials offer the best evidence for formulation of guidelines, mostARV drugs are approved for use in pediatric patients based on efficacy data from clinical trials in adults, withsupporting PK and safety data from Phase I/II trials in children. In addition, efficacy has been defined inmost adult trials based on surrogate marker data, as opposed to clinical endpoints. For the development ofthese guidelines, the Panel reviewed relevant clinical trials published in peer-reviewed journals or in abstractform, with attention to data from pediatric populations when available. Goals of Antiretroviral Treatment Current ART does not eradicate HIV infection because of the long half-life of latently infected CD4 cells;16-18 some data suggest that the half-life of intracellular HIV proviral DNA is even longer in infected children thanin adults (median 14 months vs. 5-10 months, respectively). 19Thus, based on currently available data, HIV causes a chronic infection likely requiring treatment for life once a child starts therapy. The goals of ART forHIV-infected children and adolescents include: reducing HIV-related mortality and morbidity; restoring and/or preserving immune function as reflected by CD4 cell measures; maximally and durably suppressing viral of viral drug-resistance mutations; minimizing drug-related toxicity; maintaining normal physical growth and neurocognitive development; improving quality of life; and reducing the risk of sexual transmission to discordant partners in adolescents who are sexually active. Strategies to achieve these goals require complex balancing of sometimes competing considerations. Use and selection of ART: The treatment of choice for HIV-infected children is a regimen containing at least three drugs from at least two classes of ARV drugs. The Panel has recommended several preferred andalternative regimens (see What Drugs to Start: Initial Combination Therapy for Antiretroviral-Naive Children ). The most appropriate regimen for an individual child depends on multiple factors as noted above. A regimen that is characterized as an alternative choice may be a preferred regimen for some patients. Drug sequencing and preservation of future treatment options: The choice of ARV treatment regimens should include consideration of future treatment options, such as the presence of or potential for drug resistance. Multiple changes in ARV drug regimens can rapidly exhaust treatment options and should be avoided. Appropriate sequencing of drugs for use in initial and second-line therapy can preserve future treatment options and is another strategy to maximize long-term benefit from therapy. Current recommendations for initial therapy are to use two classes of drugs (see What Drugs to Start: Initial Combination Therapy for Antiretroviral-Naive Children ), thereby sparing three classes of drugs for later use. Maximizing adherence: As discussed in Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV-Infected Children and Adolescents , poor adherence to prescribed regimens can lead to subtherapeutic levels of ARV medications, which enhances the risk of development of drug resistance and likelihood of virologic failure. Issues related to adherence to therapy should be fully assessed, discussed, and addressed with a child's caregiver and the child (when age appropriate) before the decision to initiate therapy is made. Participation by the caregiver and child Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection E-2Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection E-3in the decision-making process is crucial. Potential problems should be identified and resolved before starting therapy, even if this delays initiation of therapy. In addition, frequent follow-up is important to assess virologicresponse to therapy, drug intolerance, viral resistance, and adherence. Finally, in patients who experiencevirologic failure, it is critical to fully assess adherence before making changes to the ARV regimen.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection E-6Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection F-1When to Initiate Therapy in Antiretroviral-Naive Children (Last updated November 1, 2012; last reviewed November 1, 2012) Overview The decision on when to initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) in asymptomatic HIV-infected older children, adolescents, and adults continues to generate controversy among HIV experts. Aggressive therapy in theearly stages of HIV infection has the potential to control viral replication before the evolution of HIV in thatindividual into a diverse and potentially more pathogenic quasispecies. Initiation of therapy at higher CD4 Tlymphocyte (CD4 cell) counts has been associated with fewer drug resistance mutations at virologic failurein adults. 1Early therapy also slows immune system destruction and preserves immune function, preventing clinical disease progression.2Ongoing viral replication may be associated with persistent inflammation and development of cardiovascular, kidney, and liver disease and malignancy; studies in adults suggest that earlycontrol of replication may reduce the occurrence of these non-AIDS complications. 2-8In addition, data from a large randomized multinational clinical trial of HIV-serodiscordant adults demonstrated that effective ARTreduced secondary transmission to an uninfected sexual partner by 96%. 9Conversely, delaying therapy until later in the course of HIV infection, when clinical or immunologic symptoms appear, may result in reducedevolution of drug-resistant virus due to a lack of drug selection pressure, improved adherence to thetherapeutic regimen because the patient is symptomatic, and reduced or delayed adverse effects of ART.Because therapy in children is initiated at a young age and will likely be lifelong, concerns about adherenceand toxicities are particularly important. The Health and Human Services (HHS) Adult and Adolescent Antiretroviral Guidelines Panel now recommends initiation of therapy for all adults with HIV infection, with the proviso that the strength of therecommendations is dependent on the pre-treatment CD4 cell count. 10Randomized clinical trials have provided definitive evidence of benefit with initiation of therapy in adults with CD4 cell counts <350cells/mm 3.11Observational cohort data have demonstrated the benefit of treatment in adults with CD4 cell counts between 350 and 500 cells/mm3in reducing morbidity and mortality; therefore, adult treatment guidelines recommend initiation of lifelong ART for individuals with CD4 cell counts 500 cells/mm3.10, 12-15 For adults with CD4 counts >500 cell/mm3, observational data are less conclusive regarding the potential survival benefit of early treatment.12, 13, 16The recommendation for initiation of therapy at CD4 counts >500/mm3(BIII evidence) in adults is based on accumulating data that untreated HIV infection may be associated with development of many non-AIDS-defining diseases, the availability of more effective ARTregimens with improved tolerability, and evidence that effective ART reduces sexual HIV transmission.However, the Adult Guidelines Panel acknowledges that the amount of data supporting earlier initiation oftherapy decreases as the CD4 cell count increases above 500 cells/mm 3, and that concerns remain over the unknown overall benefit, long-term risks, cumulative additional costs, and potential for decreased medication adherence associated with earlier treatment in asymptomatic patients.10Treatment Recommendations for Initiation of Therapy in Antiretroviral-Naive HIV-Infected Infants and Children Infants Younger than 12 Months of Age The Children with HIV Early Antiretroviral Therapy (CHER) Trial, a randomized clinical trial in South Africa, demonstrated that initiating triple-drug, antiretroviral therapy (ART) before age 12 weeks in Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection F-2Panel's Recommendations Antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be initiated in all children with AIDS or significant symptoms (Clinical Category C or most Clinical Category B conditions) (AI*). ART should be initiated in HIV-infected infants <12 months of age regardless of clinical status, CD4 percentage or viral load (AIfor infants <12 weeks of age and AIIfor infants 12 weeks to 12 months). ART should be initiated in HIV-infected children 1 year who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms with the following CD4 values: mAge 1 to <3 years count <750 CD4 percentage <350 cells/mm3(AI*) with CD4 cell count 350-500 cells/mm3(BII*) ART should be considered for HIV-infected children 1 year who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms with the following CD4 values: mAge 1 to <3 years with cells/mm3or CD4 percentage 25% (BIII) mAge CD4 percentage years count >500 cells/mm3(BIII) In children with lower-strength (B level) recommendations for treatment, plasma HIV RNA levels >100,000 copies/mL provide stronger evidence for initiation of treatment (BII). Issues associated with adherence should be assessed and discussed with an HIV-infected child's caregivers before initiation of therapy (AIII). Patients/caregivers may choose to postpone therapy, and on a case-by-case basis, providers may elect to defer therapy based on clinical and/or psychosocial factors. Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in childrenwith long-term outcomes; II* = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adults with long-term clinical outcomes with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = expert opinion Studies that include children or children and adolescents but not studies limited to postpubertal adolescentsGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection F-3asymptomatic perinatally infected infants with normal CD4 percentage (>25%) resulted in a 75% reduction in early mortality, compared with delaying treatment until the infants met clinical or immune criteria.17Most of the deaths in the infants in the delayed treatment arm occurred in the first 6 months after study entry.Because the risk of rapid progression is so high in young infants and based on the data in young infants fromthe CHER study, the Panel recommends initiating therapy for all infants age <12 months regardless ofclinical status, CD4 percentage, or viral load (Table 7 ). Before therapy is initiated, it is important to fully assess, discuss, and address issues associated with adherence with an HIV-infected infant's caregivers.However, given the high risk of disease progression and mortality in young HIV-infected infants, it isimportant to expedite this assessment in infants <12 months of age. The risk of disease progression is inversely correlated with the age of a child, with the youngest infants at greatest risk of rapid disease progression. Progression to moderate or severe immune suppression is alsofrequent in older infected infants; by age 12 months, approximately 50% of children develop moderateimmune suppression and 20% develop severe immune suppression. 18In the HIV Paediatric Prognostic Markers Collaborative Study meta-analysis, the 1-year risk of AIDS or death was substantially higher inyounger children than in older children at any given level of CD4 percentage, particularly for infants <12months of age. 19Unfortunately, although the risk of progression is greatest in the first year of life, the ability to differentiate children at risk of rapid versus slower disease progression by clinical and laboratoryparameters is also most limited in young infants. No specific \"at-risk\" viral or immunologic threshold can beeasily identified, and progression of HIV disease and opportunistic infections (OIs) can occur in younginfants with normal CD4 cellcounts. 19 Identification of HIV infection during the first few months of life permits clinicians to initiate ART duringthe initial phases of primary infection. Data from a number of observational studies in the United States andEurope suggest that infants who receive early treatment are less likely to progress to AIDS or death thanthose who start therapy later. 2, 20-23Several small studies have demonstrated that, despite the very high levels of viral replication in perinatally infected infants, early initiation of treatment can result in durable viralsuppression and normalization of immunologic responses to non-HIV antigens in some infants. 24, 25In infants with sustained control of plasma viremia, failure to detect extra-chromosomal replication intermediatessuggests near-complete control of viral replication. Some of these infants have become HIV seronegative.Therapy is not curative, however, as proviral HIV-1 DNA continues to be detectable in peripheral bloodlymphocytes and viral replication resumes if therapy is discontinued. 26, 27 However, virologic suppression may take longer to achieve in young children than in older children oradults. 28, 29Possible reasons for the poor response in infants include higher virologic set points in young infants, inadequate antiretroviral (ARV) drug levels, and poor adherence because of the difficulties inadministering complex regimens to infants. With currently available drug regimens, rates of viral suppression of 70% to 80% have been reported in HIV-infected infants initiating therapy at <12 months of age. 2, 30, 31In a 5-year follow-up study of 40 HIV-infected children who initiated treatment at <6 months of age, 98% had CD4 percentage >25% and 78% had undetectable viral load with median follow-up of 5.96 years.2 Information on appropriate drug dosing in infants younger than 3 to 6 months is limited. Hepatic and renal functions are immature in newborns undergoing rapid maturational changes during the first few months of life, which can result in substantial differences in ARV dose requirements between young infants and older children.32When drug concentrations are subtherapeutic, either because of inadequate dosing, poor absorption, or incomplete adherence, ARV drug resistance can develop rapidly, particularly in the setting of high levels of viral replication in young infants. Frequent follow-up and continued assessment and support of adherence are especially important when treating young infants (see Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV-Infected Children and Adolescents ). Finally, the possibility of toxicities\u2014such as lipodystrophy, dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, osteopenia,and mitochondrial dysfunction\u2014with prolonged therapy is a concern.33A clinical trial in South Africa is assessing whether it may be possible to stop therapy begun in infancy after a defined duration of treatment that protects a child during the period of greatest risk of HIV disease progression and mortality (such as 1 to2 years) and then restart therapy when a child meets standard age-related criteria. Children 1 Year of Age and Older Disease progression is less rapid in children aged 1 year.18Children with clinical AIDS or significant symptoms (Clinical Category C or B\u2014Table 6 )34are at high risk of disease progression and death. The Panel recommends treatment for all such children, regardless of immunologic or virologic status. However,children aged 1 year who have mild clinical symptoms (Clinical Category A) or who are asymptomatic(Clinical Category N) are at lower risk of disease progression than children with more severe clinicalsymptoms. 35It should also be noted that some Clinical Category B conditions, such as a single episode of serious bacterial infection, may be less prognostic of the risk of disease progression. Consideration of CD4cell count and viral load may be useful in determining the need for therapy in children with these conditions. In adults, the strength of recommendations to initiate ART in asymptomatic individuals is based primarily on risk of disease progression, as determined by baseline CD4 cell count. 10In adults, both clinical trial and observational data support initiation of treatment in individuals with CD4 cell counts <350 cells/mm3. In HIV-infected adults in Haiti, a randomized clinical trial found significant reductions in mortality andmorbidity with initiation of treatment when CD4 cell counts fell to <350 cells/mm 3, compared with deferring treatment until CD4 cell counts fell to <200 cells/mm3.11In observational data in adults, a collaborative analysis of data from 12 adult cohorts in North America and Europe on 20,379 adults starting treatmentbetween 1995 and 2003, the risk of AIDS or death was significantly less in adults who started treatment withCD4 cell counts of 200 to 350 cells/mm 3compared with those who started therapy at CD4 cell counts <200 cells/mm3.36 No randomized trial data exist to address the comparative efficacy of starting versus deferring treatment athigher CD4 thresholds in HIV-infected adults or children. Two observational studies in adults\u2014the ARTCohort Collaboration (ART-CC) and North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design(NA-ACCORD)\u2014suggest a higher rate of progression to AIDS or death in patients deferring treatment untilCD4 count is <350 cells/mm 3compared with patients starting ART at CD4 cell counts of 351 to 500 cells/mm3.12, 13The NA-ACCORD study demonstrated a benefit of starting treatment at CD4 cell counts >500 cell/mm3compared with starting ART at CD4 cell counts below this threshold;12however the ART-CC cohort found no additional benefit for patients starting ART with CD4 cell counts >450 cells/mm3.13In a third observational study of 5,162 patients with CD4 cell counts between 500 to 799 cells/mm3, patients who started ART immediately did not experience a significant reduction in progression to AIDS or death (HR: 1.10, 95% CI: 0.67 to 1.79) or death alone (HR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.49 to 2.12), compared with those who deferred therapy.15There are no similar observational data analyses for HIV-infected children. In children, the prognostic significance of a specific CD4 percentage or count varies with age.19, 37In data from the HIV Paediatric Prognostic Markers derived from 3,941 children with 7,297 child-years of follow-up, the risk of mortality or progression to AIDS per 100 child-years is significantly higher for any given CD4 count in children aged 1 to 4 years than in children aged 5 years (Tables 3-4 and Figures 1-2 ). Data from the HIV Paediatric Prognostic Markers Collaborative Study suggest that absolute CD4 cell count is a useful prognostic marker for disease progression in children age 5 years, with risk of progression similar to that observed in adults (Table 4 ).19, 38For children age 1 to <5 years, a similar increase in risk of AIDS or death is seen when CD4 percentage drops below 25% (Table 3 ). Because the CD4 percentage is more consistent than the naturally declining CD4 cell count in the first years of life, it has been used preferentially to monitor immunologic status in children <5 years of age. However, Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection F-4an analysis of >21,000 pairs of CD4 measurements from 3,345 children <1 to 16 years of age in the HIV Paediatric Prognostic Markers Collaborative Study found that CD4 cell counts and percentages werefrequently discordant around established World Health Organization (WHO) and the Pediatric EuropeanNetwork for Treatment of AIDS (PENTA) thresholds for initiation of ART (14% and 21%, respectively). 39 Furthermore, CD4 cell counts were found to provide greater prognostic value over CD4 percentage for short-term disease progression for children <5 years as well as in older children. For example, the estimated hazardratio for AIDS or death at the 10th centile of CD4 cell count (compared with the 50th centile) was 2.2 (95%confidence interval [CI]) 1.4, 3.0) for children 1 to 2 years of age versus 1.2 (CI 0.8, 1.6) for CD4percentage. Therefore, the updated pediatric guidelines include CD4 cell count thresholds (which differ forchildren aged 1 to <3, 3 to 5, and 5 years due to age-related changes in absolute CD4 cell count) as well asCD4 percentage thresholds for all children >12 months of age. In the case of discordance between CD4 cellcounts and percentages, decisions should be based on the lower value. The level of plasma HIV RNA may provide useful information in terms of risk of progression, although its prognostic significance is weaker than CD4 count. 37Several studies have shown that older children with HIV RNA levels 100,000 copies/mL are at high risk of mortality40-42and lower neurocognitive performance;43 similar findings have been reported in adults.44-46Similarly, in the HIV Paediatric Prognostic Markers Collaborative Study meta-analysis, the 1-year risk of progression to AIDS or death rose sharply for childrenaged >1 year when HIV RNA levels were 100,000 copies/mL (Table 3 and Figures 4-5 ).37For example, the estimated 1-year risk of death was 2 to 3 times higher in children with plasma HIV RNA of 100,000copies/mL compared with 10,000 copies/mL and 8 to 10 times higher with plasma HIV RNA >1,000,000copies/mL. As with data in adults, data from pediatric studies suggest that improvement in immunologic parameters is better in children when treatment is initiated at higher CD4 percentage/count levels. 29, 47-51In a study of 1,236 perinatally infected children in the United States, only 36% of those who started treatment with CD4percentage <15% and 59% of those starting with CD4 percentage 15% to 24% achieved CD4 percentage>25% after 5 years of therapy. 52Younger age at initiation of therapy has also been associated with improved immune response and with more rapid growth reconstitution.47, 52, 53Given that disease progression in children aged 5 years is similar to that in adults,38and observational data in adults show decreased risk of mortality with initiation of therapy when CD4 cell count is <500 cells/mm3,12, 13most experts feel that recommendations for asymptomatic children in this age range should be similar to those for adults. However,there are no pediatric data to address the optimal CD4 cell count threshold for initiation of therapy in olderchildren; research studies are needed to answer this question in children more definitively. The HHS AdultTreatment Guidelines Committee has moved to endorse initiating ART in all HIV-infected adults regardlessof CD4 cell count, using varying strengths of evidence to support different CD4 cell count thresholds 10and incorporating compelling data demonstrating that ART is effective in preventing secondary transmission of HIV . However, prevention of sexual transmission of HIV is not a significant consideration for children <13 years of age. Comparative studies on the impact of treatment versus treatment delay at specific higher CD4 cell counts have not been performed in children, and observational adult studies have produced conflicting results.12, 13, 16Drug choices are more limited in children than in adults and adequate data to address the potential long-term toxicities of prolonged ART in a developing child are not yet available. Some studies have shown that a small proportion of perinatally infected children may be long-term nonprogressors, with no immunologic or clinical progression by 10 years of age despite receiving no ART.54-56Medication adherence is the core requirement for successful virologic control, but enforcing consistent adherence in childhood is often challenging.57Incomplete adherence leads to the selection of viral resistance mutations but forced administration of ARVs to children may result in treatment aversion or fatigue, which occurs among many perinatally infected children during adolescence.58The relative benefits of initiating ART in asymptomatic children with low viral burdens and high CD4 cell counts must be weighed against these potential risks. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection F-5The Panel recommends that ART should be initiated in all children who have AIDS or significant HIV-related symptoms (CDC Clinical Categories C and B, except for the following Category B condition: single episode ofserious bacterial infection [Table 6 ]), regardless of CD4 percentage/count or HIV RNA level. The Panel also generally recommends treatment for all children aged 1 year with no or mild symptoms(Clinical Categories N and A, or Clinical Category B disease due to a single episode of bacterial infection[Table 6 ]), with the strength of recommendation differing based on age and CD4 count/percentage. Patients/caregivers may choose to postpone therapy, and, on a case-by-case basis, providers may elect todefer therapy based on clinical and/or psychosocial factors. Treatment is strongly recommended regardless of HIV RNA level for children aged 1 to <3 years with CD4 cell counts <1000/mm 3OR percentage <25%, and for children 3 to <5 years with CD4 cell counts <750 cells/mm3OR percentage <25%, based on observational pediatric data.19Treatment can also be considered for children aged 1 to <3 years with CD4 cell counts 1000/mm3and percentage 25% and for children 3 to <5 years with CD4 cell counts 750 cells/mm3and percentage 25%, although the strength of the recommendation is lower because of limited data. In these children, plasma HIV RNA levels may be helpfulin decision making; plasma HIV RNA >100,000 copies/mL provides higher-rated evidence for treatment,based on pediatric observational data that demonstrate higher mortality risk with high HIV RNA levels. 19, 59 For children age 5 years with no or minimal symptoms, treatment is recommended if CD4 cell counts are500 cells/mm 3, regardless of HIV RNA level. The evidence for this recommendation is strongest for children with CD4 cell counts <350 cells/mm3. For children with CD4 cell counts 350-500 cells/mm3, the recommendation is based on observational data in adults and hence the evidence base is not as strong; thisrecommendation should not prohibit research studies in children designed to answer this question moredefinitively. Treatment should also be considered for children who are asymptomatic or have mild symptomswith CD4 counts >500 cells/mm 3, although the strength of the recommendation is lower because of limited data. Plasma HIV RNA levels may be helpful in decision making, with plasma HIV RNA >100,000copies/mL providing higher rated evidence for treatment as noted above. 19, 59 In general, except in infants and children with advanced HIV infection, ART does not need to be startedimmediately. Before initiating therapy, it is important to take time to educate caregivers (and older children)about regimen adherence and to anticipate and resolve any barriers that might diminish adherence. This isparticularly true for children aged 5 years given their lower risk of disease progression and the higher CD4cell count threshold now recommended for initiating therapy. If therapy is deferred, the health care provider should closely monitor a child's virologic, immunologic, and clinical status (see Laboratory Monitoring of Pediatric HIV Infection ). Factors to consider in deciding when to initiate therapy in children in whom treatment was deferred include: Increasing HIV RNA levels (such as HIV RNA levels approaching 100,000 copies/mL); CD4 count or percentage values approaching the age-related threshold for treatment; Development of clinical symptoms; and The ability of caregiver and child to adhere to the prescribed regimen. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection F-6Table 7. Indications for Initiation of Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV-Infected Children Table 7 provides general guidance rather than absolute recommendations for individual patients. Factors to be considered in decisions about initiation of therapy include risk of disease progression as determined byCD4 percentage or count and plasma HIV RNA copy number, the potential benefits and risks of therapy, andthe ability of the caregiver to adhere to administration of the therapeutic regimen. Before making thedecision to initiate therapy, the provider should fully assess, discuss, and address issues associated withadherence with a child (if age appropriate) and the caregiver. Patients/caregivers may choose to postponetherapy, and, on a case-by-case basis, providers may elect to defer therapy based on clinical and/orpsychosocial factors. a Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection F-7Age Criteria Recommendation <12 months Regardless of clinical symptoms, immune status, or viral load Treat ( AIfor <12 weeks of age; AIIfor 12 or CD4 1000 cells/mm3or percentage 25% Treat (AI*) Treat (AII) Consider Treatment d(BIII) 3 to <5years AIDS or significant 750 cells/mm3or percentage 25% Treat (AI*) Treat (AII) Consider Treatment d(BIII) 5 years AIDS or significant HIV-related symptomsb CD4 cell count 500 Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I= One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in childrenwith long-term outcomes; II* = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adults with long-term clinical outcomes with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = expert opinion Studies that include children or children and adolescents but not studies limited to postpubertal adolescents aChildren in whom ART is deferred need close follow-up.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection F-11Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection G-1What Drugs to Start: Initial Combination Therapy for Antiretroviral Treatment-Naive Children (Last updated November 1, 2012; last reviewed November 1, 2012) General Considerations More than 20 antiretroviral (ARV) drugs are Food and Drug Administration-approved for use in HIV- infected adults and adolescents and 19 have an approved pediatric treatment indication.1The majority of the agents approved for use in pediatric patients are available as a liquid, powder, chewable tablet, or smallcapsule or tablet suitable for pediatric use. ARV drugs fall into several major drug classes:nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, entry inhibitors (including fusion inhibitors and CCR5 antagonists), and integrase inhibitors. Information on drug formulation, pediatric dosing, and toxicity for the individual drugs and detailed information on drug interactions can be found in Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information . Over time, new drugs and drug combinations that demonstrate sustainable viral load suppression and acceptable toxicity and dosing profiles will likely become available, which will increase treatment options for children. Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) with at least three drugs from at least two drug classes is recommended for initial treatment of HIV-infected infants, children, and adolescents because it provides the best opportunity to preserve immune function and delay disease progression.2-5The goal of cART is to maximally suppress viral replication, preferably to below the limits of quantification, for as long as possible while preserving and/or restoring immune function and minimizing drug toxicity. Combination therapy slows disease progression and improves survival, results in a greater and more sustained virologic and immunologicPanel's Recommendations Combination therapy consisting of a dual-nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone with either a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or a protease inhibitor is recommended for initial treatment of HIV-infected children (AI). The goal of therapy in treatment-naive children is to reduce plasma HIV RNA levels to below the limits of quantitation using the most sensitive assays and to preserve or normalize immune status (AI). Antiretroviral (ARV) drugs initiated for chemoprophylaxis of maternal-child transmission of HIV should be discontinued in infants who are confirmed to be HIV-infected (AI). ARV drug-resistance testing is recommended before initiation of therapy in all treatment-naive infants, children, and adolescents ( AIIinfants; AIIIchildren and adolescents). Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in childrenwith long-term outcomes; II* = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adults with long-term clinical outcomes with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = expert opinion Studies that include children or children and adolescents but not studies limited to postpubertal adolescentsresponse, and delays development of viral mutations that confer resistance to the drugs being used.4-6 If an infant is confirmed to be HIV-infected while receiving chemoprophylaxis to prevent mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV , prophylactic ARV drugs should be discontinued promptly and treatmentinitiated with a combination regimen of at least three drugs. Zidovudine can be included as a component ofthe treatment regimen if zidovudine drug resistance is not detected. Treatment-naive infants and children with perinatal HIV infection can have drug-resistant virus either because it was transmitted perinatally or during breastfeeding or because resistance developed while theywere receiving ARV prophylaxis. Thus, ARV drug-resistance testing is recommended before initiation oftherapy in all treatment-naive infants and children. In infants receiving prophylactic ARV drugs for PMTCT,ARV drug resistance testing can be performed at the same time as confirmatory HIV testing or whenprophylactic ARV drugs are discontinued. In a study in New York State, genotypic drug resistance wasidentified in 12% of 91 HIV-infected infants born from 1998 to 1999 and in 19% of 42 infants born from2000 to 2001. 7, 8Detection of resistance in the infants was not significantly associated with a history of maternal and infant ARV prophylaxis. Similarly, following initiation of treatment, mutations associated withdrug-resistance were detected in 24% of 21 infants at a median age of 9.7 weeks. Most of the mutations werenot associated with maternal/infant prophylaxis regimens and resistant virus was persistently archived in theresting CD4 cell reservoir in all the infants. In a study in Africa, infants, regardless of whether they wereexposed to nevirapine as part of PMTCT, had higher rates virologic failure on nevirapine-based regimenscompared with lopinavir/ritonavir-based regimens. 9-11In a Spanish cohort of children, resistance mutations were detected in 13% of treatment-naive children.12In the United States and Europe, drug-resistant virus has been identified in 6% to 16% of ARV-naive adults and 18% of adolescents with recently acquired HIVinfection. 13-17For ARV-naive children beyond infancy, limited available data do not demonstrate that resistance testing before initiation of therapy correlates with greater success of initial ART.18Nevertheless, because the prevalence of resistance in HIV-infected children is sufficiently high and on the basis of expertopinion, the Panel recommends ARV drug-resistance testing with a genotypic assay before initiation oftherapy in all treatment-naive infants and children and use of resistance testing results to select the initialdrug combination. 19(See Antiretroviral Drug-Resistance Testing .) Resistance testing in HIV-infected adolescents and adults is also recommended at entry into care. References 1. Food and Drug Administration.

Few randomized, Phase III clinical trials of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in pediatric patients exist that provide direct comparison of different treatment regimens. Most pediatric drug data come from Phase I/II safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) trials and non-randomized, open-label studies. In general, even in studies in adults, assessment of drug efficacy and potency is primarily based on surrogate marker endpoints, such as CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4 cell) count and HIV RNA levels. The Panel continually modifies recommendations on optimal initial therapy for children as new data become available, new therapies or drug formulations are developed, and additional toxicities are recognized. Panel's Recommendations The Panel recommends initiating combination antiretroviral therapy in treatment-naive children using one of the following agents plus a dual-nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone combination children atazanavir/ritonavir (AI*) For children aged 3 years: efavirenz (AI*) For children aged 42 weeks postmenstrual and 14 days postnatal: lopinavir/ritonavir (AI) The Panel recommends the following preferred dual-NRTI backbone combinations (in alphabetical order): For children aged 3 months: abacavir + (lamivudine or emtricitabine) (AI) HLA-B*5701 genetic testing should be performed before initiating abacavir-based therapy, and abacavir should not be given to a child who tests positive for HLA-B*5701 (AII*). For adolescents, Tanner Stage 4 or 5: tenofovir + (lamivudine or emtricitabine) (AI*) For emtricitabine) (AI*) Table 8provides a list of Panel-recommended alternative and acceptable regimens. Selection of an initial regimen should be individualized based on a number of factors including characteristics of the proposed regimen, patient characteristics, and results of viral resistance testing (AIII). Alternative regimens may be preferable for some patients based on their individual characteristics and needs. Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in childrenwith long-term outcomes; II* = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adults with long-term clinical outcomes with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = expert opinion Studies that include children or children and adolescents but not studies limited to postpubertal adolescentsInformation considered by the Panel for recommending specific drugs or regimens includes: Data demonstrating durable viral suppression, immunologic improvement, and clinical improvement (when such data are available) with the regimen, preferably in children as well as adults; The extent of pediatric experience with the particular drug or regimen; Incidence and types of short- and long-term drug toxicity with the regimen, with special attention to toxicity reported in children; Availability and acceptability of formulations appropriate for pediatric use, including palatability, ease of preparation (such as powders), volume of syrups, and pill size and number of pills; Dosing frequency and food and fluid requirements; and Potential for drug interactions with other medications. The Panel classifies drugs or drug combinations into one of several categories as follows: Preferred: Drugs or drug combinations are designated as preferred for use in treatment-naive children when clinical trial data in children or, more often, in adults have demonstrated optimal and durable efficacy with acceptable toxicity and ease of use, and pediatric studies demonstrate that safety andefficacy are suggested using surrogate markers; additional considerations are listed above. Alternative: Drugs or drug combinations are designated as alternatives for initial therapy when clinical trial data in children or adults show efficacy but there are disadvantages compared with preferredregimens in terms of more limited experience in children; the extent of antiviral efficacy or durability isless well defined in children or less than a preferred regimen in adults; there are specific toxicityconcerns; or there are dosing, formulation, administration, or interaction issues for that drug or regimen. Use in Special Circumstances: Some drugs or drug combinations are recommended for use as initial therapy only in special circumstances when preferred or alternative drugs cannot be used. Not Recommended: Some drugs and drug combinations are not recommended for initial therapy in children because of inferior virologic response, potential serious safety concerns (including potentiallyoverlapping toxicities), or pharmacologic antagonism. These drugs and drug combinations are listed inTable 9 . Insufficient Data to Recommend: For a number of drugs and drug combinations approved for use in adults, PK or safety data in children are unavailable or too limited to make a recommendation on use ofthe drugs as initial therapy in children. Some of these drugs and drug combinations may be appropriatefor consideration in management of treatment-experienced children, even though they are notrecommended for initial therapy in children (see Management of Treatment-Experienced Infants, Children, and Adolescents ). Factors to Consider When Selecting an Initial Regimen Choice of a regimen should be individualized based on a number of factors including characteristics of the proposed regimen, patient characteristics, and results of viral resistance testing. Advantages and disadvantages of each class-based regimen are delineated in detail in the sections that follow and in Tables 10-14 . In addition, because cART will need to be administered lifelong, considerations related to the choice of initial antiretroviral (ARV) regimen should also include an understanding of barriers to adherence, including the complexity of schedules and food requirements for different regimens; differing formulations; palatability problems; and potential limitations in subsequent treatment options, should resistance develop. Treatment should only be initiated after assessment and counseling of caregivers about adherence to therapy.1, 2 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection G-5Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection G-6Choice of NNRTI- Versus PI-Based Initial Regimens Preferred regimens NNRTI- or PI-based regimen should be basedon patient characteristics and preferences, results of viral drug resistance testing, and information citedbelow. Recent clinical trial data in children provide some guidance for choosing between an NNRTI-based regimen and a PI-based regimen for initial therapy. P1060 compared a nevirapine-based regimen to a lopinavir-basedregimen in HIV-infected infants and children aged 2 to 35 months in 7 African countries. Infants and childrenin this study were stratified at entry based on either prior maternal or infant exposure to single-dosenevirapine prophylaxis for prevention of mother-to-child children with prior exposure to nevirapine, 39.6% of children in the nevirapine group reached astudy endpoint of death, virologic failure, or toxicity by Week 24 compared with 21.7% of children in thelopinavir/ritonavir group. 3Among infants and children with no prior nevirapine exposure, 40.1% of children treated with nevirapine met a study endpoint after 24 weeks in the study compared with 18.4% of childrenwho received lopinavir/ritonavir. 4Additional nonrandomized studies have also indicated that infants exposed to nevirapine in the peripartum period as part of PMTCT strategy had a higher risk of treatment failurebecause of nevirapine resistance. 5-7 A comparison of a PI-based regimen and a NNRTI-based regimen was also undertaken in HIV-infectedtreatment-naive children aged 30 days to <18 years in PENPACT-1 (PENTA 9/PACTG 390) (the study didnot dictate the specific NNRTI or PI initiated). In the PI-based group, 49% of children receivedlopinavir/ritonavir and 48% received nelfinavir; the children receivedefavirenz and 38% received nevirapine. Efavirenz was recommended only for children aged >3 years. After 4years, 73% of children and 70% randomized to NNRTI-based therapyremained on their initial cART regimen. In both groups, 82% of children had viral loads <400 copies/mL,suggesting that selection of an NNRTI or a PI did not influence outcome. Although the age of participantsoverlapped somewhat between P1060 and PENPACT-1 (in PENPACT-1, the lowest quartile was aged <2.8years), PENPACT-1 generally enrolled older children. 8 Results of the P1060 study support the recommendation that a PI-based regimen containinglopinavir/ritonavir should be the preferred initial regimen for children aged <3 years based on superiorvirologic suppression. However, in both single-dose nevirapine-exposed and -unexposed children in theP1060 study, participants receiving the nevirapine-based regimen demonstrated better immunologic responseand growth than those receiving a lopinavir/ritonavir-based regimen, although these differences did notachieve statistical significance. Similarly, in the NEVEREST study, children switched to a nevirapine regimen showed better immune and growth responses than those continuing a lopinavir/ritonavir regimen. 9 Based on these findings, the potential for improved lipid profiles with nevirapine use,9, 10and the poor palatability of liquid lopinavir/ritonavir, liquid nevirapine remains an acceptable alternative for infants who were not exposed to single-dose nevirapine for PMTCT and who cannot tolerate lopinavir/ritonavir. In children aged 3 years, either an NNRTI-based or a PI-based regimen is acceptable. efavirenz both have an FDA-approved pediatric indication. In the United States, nevirapine is available in a liquid formulation but efavirenz is not. Advantages and disadvantages of different NNRTI drugs are delineated in Table 11 . Use of NNRTIs as initial therapy preserves the PI class for future use andconfers lower risk of dyslipidemia and fat maldistribution than use of some agents in the PI class. In addition, for children taking solid formulations, NNRTI-based regimens generally have a lower pill burden than PI-based regimens. The major disadvantages of the current NNRTI drugs FDA-approved for use in children arethat a single viral mutation can confer high-level drug resistance, and cross resistance develops betweennevirapine and efavirenz. In infants, regardless of whether nevirapine is used as part of PMTCT, nevirapine-based regimens demonstrate higher rates of virologic failure than with lopinavir/ritonavir-based regimens. 3, 4Rare but serious and potentially life-threatening skin and hepatic toxicity can occur with all NNRTI drugs, but is mostfrequent with nevirapine, at least in HIV-infected adults. Like PIs, NNRTIs have the potential to interact withother drugs also metabolized via hepatic enzymes; however, these drug interactions are less frequent withNNRTIs than with boosted PI regimens. Efavirenz, in combination with 2 NRTIs, is the preferred NNRTI for initial therapy of children aged 3 years based on clinical trial experience in children and because higher rates of toxicity have been observed withnevirapine in clinical trials in adults. Results of studies comparing virologic response to nevirapine- versusefavirenz-based regimens in adults are conflicting, and no randomized studies have been done in children.Because nevirapine therapy is associated with the rare occurrence of significant hypersensitivity reactions(HSRs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and rare but potentially life-threatening hepatitis, 11, 12 nevirapine is recommended as an alternative, rather than a preferred, NNRTI for initial treatment of ARV-naive children. Etravirine is an NNRTI approved by the FDA for treatment of HIV-1 infection in treatment-experienced patients aged 6 years. Rilpivirine, also an NNRTI, is FDA-approved for treatment of HIV-1 infection intreatment-naive adults only. At this time, there is insufficient information to consider either of these agents asinitial therapy in children. Preferred NNRTI Efavirenz as preferred NNRTI (AI*): In clinical trials in HIV-infected adults, a PI-sparing regimen of efavirenz in combination with zidovudine and lamivudine was associated with an excellent virologicresponse; 70% of treated adults had plasma HIV RNA <400 copies/mL at 48 weeks. 13In randomized controlled trials in treatment-naive adults, efavirenz-treated patients had superior or similar virologic activitycompared with those receiving PI- or triple NRTI-based regimens. 14-19Clinical trials in adults are conflicting in terms of comparative efficacy of efavirenz and nevirapine (see discussion below).20-24In PENPACT-1, subjects receiving efavirenz or nevirapine showed comparable virologic suppression after 4 years.8An analysis of children and adults starting first-line cART in Uganda demonstrated the superiority of anefavirenz-based regimen compared with a nevirapine-based regimen in 222 children and adolescents (mean age, 9.2 years). 25Few had received nevirapine as part of a PMTCT regimen. In addition, a recent report of 761 children aged 3 to 16 years who received either efavirenz (n = 398) or nevirapine (n = 363) in the Botswana national treatment program demonstrated increased rates of virologic failure among those receiving nevirapine (OR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.5-3.4). Time to virologic failure also favored an efavirenz regimen.26 Efavirenz in combination with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) or with an NRTI and a PI has been studied in HIV-infected children.27-33Results are comparable to those seen in adults. The appropriate dose of efavirenz for children aged <3 years has not been determined; therefore, efavirenz is not recommended for children in this age group. For children aged 3 years, who are unable to swallow pills, some clinicians recommend breaking open efavirenz capsules and adding the contents to food or liquid. Bioequivalence data based on bioavailability and PK support this option.34 The major limitations of efavirenz are central nervous system (CNS) side effects in both children and adults; Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection G-7Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection G-8reported adverse effects include fatigue, poor sleeping patterns, vivid dreams, poor concentration, agitation, depression, and suicidal ideation. Although in most patients this toxicity is transient, in some patients thesymptoms may persist or occur months after initiating efavirenz. In several studies, the incidence of suchadverse effects was correlated with efavirenz plasma concentrations and the occurrence was more frequent inadults with higher levels of drug. 35-38In patients with pre-existing psychiatric conditions, efavirenz should be used cautiously for initial therapy. Rash may also occur with efavirenz treatment; it is generally mild andtransient but appears to be more common in children than adults. 31, 33In addition, first-trimester exposure to efavirenz is potentially teratogenic (see Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for detailed information). Although emerging information about the use of efavirenz in pregnancy is reassuring,39 alternative regimens that do not include efavirenz should be strongly considered in adolescent females whoare trying to conceive or who are not using effective and consistent contraception because of the potential forteratogenicity with first-trimester efavirenz exposure, assuming these alternative regimens are acceptable tothe provider and will not compromise the woman's health (BIII). Alternative NNRTI Nevirapine as alternative NNRTI (AI): Nevirapine has extensive clinical and safety experience in HIV- infected children and has shown ARV efficacy in a variety of combination regimens (see Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for detailed information).40Nevirapine in combination with two NRTIs or with an NRTI and a PI has been studied in HIV-infected children.41-43 In a large adult trial (2NN trial), although virologic efficacy was comparable between nevirapine andefavirenz (plasma HIV RNA <50 copies/mL at 48 weeks in 56% of those receiving nevirapine vs. 62% ofthose receiving efavirenz), serious hepatic toxicity was more frequent in the nevirapine arm than theefavirenz arm (hepatic laboratory toxicity in 8%14% of those on nevirapine, compared with 5% onefavirenz). 24In ARTEN trial, antiretroviral therapy-naive participants were randomized to nevirapine 200 mg twice daily, nevirapine 400 mg once daily, or ritonavir-boosted atazanavir, all in combination withtenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir)/emtricitabine. By 48 weeks, similar proportions of subjects in eachgroup had at least 2 consecutive plasma HIV RNA levels <50 copies/mL (66.8% for nevirapine vs. 65.3% forritonavir-boosted atazanavir) but participants in the nevirapine arms discontinued study drugs becauseof adverse events (13.6% vs. 2.6%, respectively) or lack of efficacy (8.4% vs. 1.6%, respectively). 44 Other studies in adults have indicated potentially increased risk of hepatic toxicity with nevirapine-basedcompared with efavirenz-based regimens. 45In addition, data in adults indicate that symptomatic hepatic toxicity is more frequent in individuals with higher CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4 cell) counts and in women,particularly women CD4 cell counts >250 cells/mm 3and men with CD4 cell counts >400 cells/mm3. A more recent study including 820 women in Kenya, Zambia, and Thailand demonstrated that hepatic toxicitywas associated with elevated baseline liver function tests and not CD4 cell count at the time of nevirapine initiation. 46In the published literature, hepatic toxicity appears to be less frequent in children receiving chronic nevirapine therapy than in adults.42, 43, 47In an FDA review of 783 HIV-infected pediatric patients, there was only 1 case of hepatitis, which was reported in a 17-year-old child; there was no evidence of a serious hepatic event associated with nevirapine use in any child before adolescence.47A recent report of 1,434 children in Malawi receiving treatment with a nevirapine-based regimen noted that only 0.14% of the children discontinued the regimen because of hepatic toxicity.48In contrast, skin reactions and HSRs associated with nevirapine use have been reported in children.49However, it should be noted that data are limited about the relationship between CD4 cell count and percentage in children at the time they initiate nevirapine and the development of toxicity. In a study of 201 HIV-infected children in Asia initiating cART (137 randomized to a nevirapine-containing regimen), the development of overall toxicities, including rash and hepatotoxicity, was almost three-fold higher in children initiating cART when CD4 percentage was 15%.50The safety of substituting efavirenz for nevirapine in patients who have experienced nevirapine- associated hepatic toxicity is unknown. Efavirenz use in this situation has been well tolerated in the verylimited number of patients in whom it has been reported but this substitution should be attempted with caution.51 Because of the greater potential for toxicity and possibly increased risk of virologic failure, nevirapine-basedregimens are considered an alternative rather than the preferred NNRTI in children aged 3 years. In childrenaged <3 years, nevirapine is considered an alternative because of increased risk of virologic failure. Even ifnot exposed to nevirapine as part of PMTCT, infants on nevirapine-based regimens had higher rates ofvirologic failure than infants on lopinavir/ritonavir-based regimens. 3-5, 52However, infants treated with nevirapine showed a trend toward greater improvement in both immunologic status and growth.3 A recent study randomized infants exposed to nevirapine who had achieved viral suppression for an averageof 9 months using lopinavir/ritonavir-based therapy as part of a PMTCT regimen to continuation of thelopinavir/ritonavir regimens or a switch to a nevirapine-based regimen. After 52 weeks of follow up, plasmaviremia 50 copies/mL occurred less frequently in the switched group compared with the continuation group.CD4 response was also better in the switched group. However, 20% of the switched group experiencedbreakthrough viremia (confirmed viral load >1,000 copies/mL) and subsequent analysis demonstrated thatfailure was associated with higher (>25%) frequencies of pretreatment NNRTI mutations. 53These findings suggest this strategy may be an option for children in whom standard genotyping before treatment detects noNNRTI mutations but should be undertaken with careful monitoring of viral load. 9 Similar to recommendations in adults, nevirapine also should not be used in postpubertal adolescent girlswith CD4 cell counts >250/mm 3because of the increased risk of symptomatic hepatic toxicity, unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risk.12Nevirapine also should be used with caution in children with elevated pretreatment liver function tests. PI-Based Regimens Regimens Nine PIs are currently FDA-approved for use and 7 are approved for use in children. Advantages of PI-basedregimens include excellent virologic potency, high barrier for development of drug resistance (requiresmultiple mutations), and sparing of the NNRTI drug class. However, because PIs are metabolized via hepaticenzymes the drugs have potential for multiple drug interactions. They may also be associated with metaboliccomplications such as dyslipidemia, fat maldistribution, and insulin resistance. Factors to consider inselecting a PI-based regimen for treatment-naive children include virologic potency, dosing frequency, pillburden, food or fluid requirements, availability of palatable pediatric formulations, drug interaction profile,toxicity profile (particularly related to metabolic complications), and availability of data in children. (Table 12lists the advantages and disadvantages of PIs. See Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for detailed pediatric information on each drug.) Ritonavir acts as a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) isoenzyme, thereby inhibiting the metabolism of other PIs coadministered with ritonavir. The drug has been used in low doses combined with another PI as a PK booster, increasing drug exposure by prolonging the half-life of the second, boosted PI. Boosted PI-based regimens are commonly used in treatment of adults and pediatric data are available for several combinations. Co-formulated lopinavir/ritonavir has been studied in infants as young as age 25 days54 and is FDA-approved for use in infants after a postmenstrual age (first day of the mother's last menstrual period to birth plus the time elapsed after birth) of 42 weeks and a postnatal age of at least 14 days. Fosamprenavir with low-dose ritonavir is FDA-approved in infants and children aged 4 weeks, although the Panel only recommends use in those aged 6 months and older. Darunavir with low-dose ritonavir is FDA- approved in children aged 3 years and atazanavir and tipranavir with low-dose ritonavir are FDA-approved in children aged 6 years. In addition, the use of low-dose ritonavir increases the potential for hyperlipidemia55and drug-drug interactions. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection G-9The Panel recommends either atazanavir with low-dose ritonavir or coformulated lopinavir/ritonavir as the preferred PI for initial therapy in children based on virologic potency in adult and pediatric studies, highbarrier to development of drug resistance, excellent toxicity profile in adults and children, availability ofappropriate dosing information, and experience as initial therapy in both resource-rich and resource-limitedareas. Although lopinavir/ritonavir can be used in children aged 42 weeks postmenstrual and aged 14 days postnatal, at the current time, atazanavir with low-dose ritonavir should be used only in children aged 6years. Two additional PIs\u2014fosamprenavir and darunavir\u2014can be considered as alternative PIs for use inchildren. Fosamprenavir is FDA-approved for treatment of HIV infection in infants aged 4 weeks and older.However, because of low drug exposure in infants aged <6 months, the Panel recommends use only inpatients aged 6 months. Darunavir can also be used for children aged 3 years. Both fosamprenavir anddarunavir should be used in combination with low-dose ritonavir. Other PIs that can be considered in specialcircumstances when preferred and alternative drugs are not available or are not tolerated includefosamprenavir without boosting ritonavir in children aged 2 years, atazanavir without boosting ritonavir inadolescents aged 13 years and weighing >39 kg, and nelfinavir in children aged 2 years. Asaquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily)-based regimen compared with a lopinavir/ritonavir-basedregimen demonstrated comparable virologic and immunologic outcomes when used as initial therapy intreatment-naive adults. 56However, saquinavir is not recommended for initial therapy in children because the agent is not available in a pediatric formulation and dosing and outcome data on saquinavir use in childrenare limited. Although good virologic and immunologic responses have been observed with indinavir-basedregimens in adults, the drug is not available in a liquid formulation and high rates of hematuria, sterileleukocyturia, and nephrolithiasis in pediatric patients using indinavir have been reported. 57-60The incidence of hematuria and nephrolithiasis with indinavir therapy may be higher in children than adults.57, 60Therefore, indinavir alone or with ritonavir boosting is not recommended as initial therapy in children. Tipranavircurrently is not recommended for initial therapy in treatment-naive children because experience with thedrug is limited. Preferred PIs Atazanavir with low-dose ritonavir as preferred PI (for children 6 years) (AI*): Atazanavir is a once- daily PI that was FDA-approved in March 2008 for use in children aged 6 years. It has efficacy equivalentto efavirenz-based and lopinavir/ritonavir-based combination therapy when given in combination withzidovudine and lamivudine in treatment-naive adults. 18, 61-63Seventy-three percent of 48 treatment-naive South African children achieved viral load <400 copies/mL by 48 weeks when given atazanavir with orwithout ritonavir in combination with 2 NRTIs. children aged 6 to18 years in IMPAACT/PACTG P1020A who received the capsule formulation of atazanavir with or withoutritonavir, 51% and 47% achieved with low-dose ritonavir boosting, atazanavir achieves enhanced concentrations compared with the unboosted drug in adults and children aged 6 years67-69and in ARV-naive adults appears to be associated with fewer PI-resistance mutations at virologic failure compared with atazanavir given without ritonavir boosting.70The main adverse effect associated with atazanavir/low-dose ritonavir is indirect hyperbilirubinemia, with or without jaundice or icterus, but without concomitant hepatic transaminase elevations. Although atazanavir is associated with fewer lipid abnormalities than other PIs, lipid levels are higher with low-dose ritonavir boosting than with atazanavir alone.55 Lopinavir/ritonavir as preferred PI (for infants with a postmenstrual age 42 weeks and postnatal age 14 days) (AI): In clinical trials in adults, regimens containing lopinavir/ritonavir plus 2 NRTIs have been found to have potent virologic activity in treatment-naive patients. In a comparative trial of lopinavir/ritonavir versus nelfinavir (both combined with stavudine/lamivudine), lopinavir/ritonavir had virologic efficacy superior to nelfinavir (plasma HIV RNA <400 copies/mL in 84% vs. 66% of patients, respectively), and drug-resistant virus in patients with detectable plasma viral load at 48 weeks was detected Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection G-10in none of 51 lopinavir/ritonavir-treated patients, compared with 45% of 43 nelfinavir-treated patients.71, 72 The groups had similar rates of toxicity. Lopinavir/ritonavir has been studied in both ARV-naive and - experienced children and has demonstrated durable virologic activity and low toxicity (see Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for detailed information).3, 73-80In addition, dosing and efficacy data in infants as young as 25 days of age are available.54, 77Post-marketing reports of lopinavir/ritonavir- associated cardiac toxicity (including complete atrioventricular block, bradycardia, and cardiomyopathy),lactic acidosis, acute renal failure, CNS depression, and respiratory complications leading to death have beenreported, predominantly in preterm neonates. These reports have resulted in a change in lopinavir/ritonavirlabeling including a recommendation to not administer the combination to neonates until they reach apostmenstrual age of 42 weeks and a postnatal age of at least 14 days. In addition, although once-dailylopinavir/ritonavir is FDA-approved for initial therapy in adults, 81PK data in children do not support a recommendation for once-daily dosing in children.82, 83 Alternative PIs Darunavir with low-dose ritonavir as alternative PI (for children aged 3 years) (AI*): Darunavir combined with low-dose ritonavir is -experienced adults and for ARV-naiveand -experienced children aged 3 years. In a randomized, open-label trial in adults, darunavir/ritonavir(800/100 mg once daily) was found to be non-inferior to lopinavir/ritonavir (once or twice daily), when bothboosted PIs were administered in combination with tenofovir/emtricitabine. Plasma HIV RNA levels were <50copies/mL in 84% of darunavir/ritonavir recipients and 78% of lopinavir/ritonavir recipients at 48 weeks and79% of darunavir/ritonavir recipients and 71% of lopinavir/ritonavir recipients at 96 weeks (P <0.001, for each comparison). Adverse events were also less common in the darunavir/ritonavir group (P <0.01). 84, 85In a study of treatment-experienced children (aged 6-17 years), twice-daily darunavir/ritonavir-based therapy was welltolerated and 48% of the children achieved HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL by 48 weeks. 86In another study of treatment-experienced pediatric subjects (aged 3-<6 years and weight 10 kg-<20 kg), 57% of subjects hadHIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/mL and 81% were less than 400 copies/mL after 24 weeks of treatment. 87 Twenty children completed the trial; one stopped prematurely because of vomiting. Once-dailydarunavir/ritonavir has been studied in treatment-naive adolescents aged 12 to 18 years (mean age, 14.6 years).After 24 weeks of treatment, 11 of 12 subjects had HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL. 88Darunavir with low-dose ritonavir is recommended as an alternative initial therapy in HIV-infected children based on data from thesestudies and the finding of high potency and low toxicity in adults. Some experts would only recommendboosted darunavir for treatment-experienced children and reserve its use for patients with PI-resistantmutations. While twice-daily dosing of darunavir with ritonavir boosting is recommended as an alternative PIfor children aged 3 years, once-daily dosing of darunavir currently should only be considered for treatment-naive adolescents aged >12 years. Fosamprenavir with low-dose ritonavir as alternative PI (for children aged 6 months) (AI*): Fosamprenavir (the prodrug of amprenavir) is now available in a pediatric liquid formulation and a tablet formulation. Amprenavir is no longer manufactured. In June 2007, fosamprenavir suspension was FDA- approved for use in pediatric patients aged 2 years. The approval was based on two open-label studies in pediatric patients aged 2 to 18 years.89, 90In 2012, fosamprenavir was FDA-approved for use in PI-naive children as young as 4 weeks who were born at 38 weeks' gestation and had attained a postnatal age of 28 days. Overall, fosamprenavir was well tolerated and effective in suppressing viral load and increasing CD4 cell count (see Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for detailed information). There is less pediatric experience with fosamprenavir than with lopinavir/ritonavir. In an adult clinical trial, fosamprenavir with low-dose ritonavir was demonstrated to be noninferior to lopinavir/ritonavir.91In children aged 4 weeks, fosamprenavir should be used in combination with low-dose ritonavir boosting to ensure adequate drug levels. In addition, because of low drug exposure, the Panel recommends fosamprenavir with low-dose ritonavir only for children aged 6 months. Once-daily dosing of fosamprenavir is not recommended for pediatric patients. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection G-11PIs for Use in Special Circumstances Atazanavir without ritonavir boosting in children age 13 years (BII*): Although unboosted atazanavir is FDA-approved for treatment-naive adolescents aged 13 years who weigh >39 kg and are unable to tolerate ritonavir, data from the IMPAACT/PACTG 1020A study indicate that higher doses of unboostedatazanavir (on a mg/m 2basis) are required in adolescents than in adults to achieve adequate drug concentrations69(see Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for detailed information on dosing used in IMPAACT/PACTG P1020A). If using unboosted atazanavir in treatment-naive patients,clinicians should using a dual-NRTI combination other than didanosine/emtricitabine because thiscombination demonstrated inferior 5175. 92If didanosine, emtricitabine, andatazanavir are used in combination, patients should be instructed to take didanosine and atazanavir at least 2 hours apart, to take atazanavir with food, and to take didanosine on an empty stomach. Fosamprenavir without ritonavir boosting in children aged 2 years (BII*): Fosamprenavir without ritonavir boosting has been studied in children aged 2 years but is only recommended in specialcircumstances when preferred or alternative PI-based regimens cannot be used. Nelfinavir for children aged 2 years (BI*): Nelfinavir in combination with two NRTIs is an acceptable PI choice for initial treatment of children aged 2 years in special circumstances. The pediatric experiencewith nelfinavir-based regimens in ARV-naive and -experienced children is extensive, with follow-up inchildren receiving the regimen for as long as 7 years. 93The drug has been well tolerated\u2014diarrhea is the primary adverse effect; however, in clinical studies the virologic potency of nelfinavir has varied greatly,with reported rates of suppression ranging from 26% to 69% (see Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for detailed information). Several studies have shown a correlation between nelfinavir trough concentrations and virologic response in treatment-naive pediatric patients.94In one such study, virologic response at Week 48 was observed in 29% of children with subtherapeutic nelfinavir troughs(<0.8 94The interpatient variability in plasma concentrations is great in children, with lower levels in younger children.95-100The optimal dose of nelfinavir in younger children, particularly in those aged <2 years, has not been well defined.These data, combined with data in adults showing inferior potency of nelfinavir compared with other PIs andefavirenz, balanced against the advantage of a PI that is not coadministered with low-dose ritonavir forboosting, 72, 101-104make nelfinavir an agent for use in special circumstances in treatment-naive children aged 2 years and not recommended for treatment of children aged <2 years. Nelfinavir is currently available only as tablets, which can be dissolved in water or other liquids to make a slurry that is then ingested by children unable to swallow whole tablets. Dissolving nelfinavir tablets in waterand swallowing whole tablets resulted in comparable PK parameters in a study in adults. 105 Selection of Dual-NRTI Backbone as Part of Initial Combination Therapy Summary: Selection of Dual-NRTI Backbone children <13 years of age. Tenofovir is FDA-approved for use in children and adolescents aged 2 years. Because of decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) observed in adults and children receiving tenofovir, the Panel has opted to consider use of tenofovir based on Tanner stage and only in children aged 2 years. We have reserved our strongest recommendation for adolescents who are in the late stages of or who have completed puberty (Tanner stages 4 and 5). Tenofovir can be used in younger children after weighing potential risks of decreased BMD versus benefits of therapy. It is important to note that although decreases in BMD are observed, the clinical significance of these changes is not yet known. Dual-NRTI combinations form the backbone of combination regimens for both adults and children. Dual-NRTI combinations that have been studied in children include zidovudine in combination Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection G-12with abacavir, didanosine, or combination with and tenofovir in combination with lamivudine oremtricitabine. 1, 29, 67, 93, 99, 106, 107, 114-119Advantages and disadvantages of different dual-NRTI backbone options are delineated in Table 10 . Preferred Dual-NRTI Regimens The dual-NRTI combinations preferred for initial therapy in children are abacavir or zidovudine combinedwith either lamivudine or emtricitabine, and in adolescents who are Tanner Stage 4 or 5, tenofovir combinedwith either lamivudine or emtricitabine. The most extensive experience in children is with zidovudine incombination with lamivudine (AI*). Data on the safety of this combination in children are extensive and thecombination is generally well tolerated. The major toxicity associated with zidovudine/lamivudine is bonemarrow suppression, manifested as macrocytic anemia and neutropenia; minor toxicities includegastrointestinal toxicity and fatigue. Both lamivudine and emtricitabine are well tolerated with few adverse effects. Although there is less experience in children with emtricitabine than with lamivudine, it is similar to lamivudine and can besubstituted for lamivudine as one component of a preferred dual-NRTI backbone (that is, emtricitabine incombination with abacavir or zidovudine). The advantages of emtricitabine are that it can be administeredonce daily and it is available as an oral solution. Both lamivudine and emtricitabine select for the M184Vresistance mutation, which is associated with high-level resistance to both drugs; a modest decrease insusceptibility to abacavir and didanosine; and improved susceptibility to zidovudine, stavudine, and tenofovirbased on decreased viral fitness. 108, 109 Abacavir in combination with lamivudine (AI) has been shown to be as potent or, possibly, more potent than zidovudine in combination with lamivudine in both children and adults.110, 111However, abacavir/lamivudine has the potential for abacavir-associated life-threatening HSRs in a small proportion of patients. In 5 years offollow-up, abacavir plus lamivudine maintained significantly better viral suppression and growth in childrenthan did zidovudine plus lamivudine and zidovudine plus abacavir. 111Abacavir hypersensitivity is more common in individuals with certain HLA genotypes, particularly HLA-B*5701 (see Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information ); however, in the United States, the prevalence of HLA-B*5701 is much lower in African Americans and Hispanics (2%-2.5%) than in whites (8%).112Pretreatment screening for HLA-B*5701 before initiation of abacavir treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the rate of abacavirHSRs in HIV-infected adults (from 7.8% to 3.4%). 113Before initiating abacavir-based therapy in HIV- infected children, genetic screening for HLA-B*5701 should be performed and children who test positive forHLA-B*5701 should not receive abacavir (AII*). Tenofovir has been studied in HIV-infected children in combination with other NRTIs and as an oral sprinkle/granule formulation. 114-117The use of tenofovir in pediatric patients aged 2 to <18 years is approved by the FDA based on data from two randomized studies. In study 321, 87 treatment-experienced subjects aged 12 to <18 years, were randomized to receive tenofovir or placebo plus optimized background regimen (OBR) for 48 weeks. Although there was no difference in virologic response between the two groups, the safety and PKs of tenofovir in children in the study were similar to those in adults receiving tenofovir.118In study 352, 92 treatment-experienced children, aged 2 to <18 years with virologic suppression on stavudine- or zidovudine-containing regimens randomized to either replace stavudine or zidovudine with tenofovir or continue their original regimen. After 48 weeks, 89% of subjects receiving tenofovir and 90% of subjects continuing their original regimen had HIV-1 RNA concentrations <400 copies/mL.119 Tenofovir in combination with lamivudine or emtricitabine is a preferred dual-NRTI combination for use in adolescents Tanner Stage 4 or 5 (AI*). The fixed-dose combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine and the fixed-dose triple combination of tenofovir, emtricitabine, and efavirenz both allow for once-daily dosing, Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection G-13which may help improve adherence in older adolescents. In studies in adults, tenofovir when used with lamivudine or emtricitabine in combination with efavirenz had potent viral suppression for up to 3 years andwas superior to zidovudine/lamivudine/efavirenz in viral efficacy. 120, 121In ACTG 5202, adults were randomly assigned to tenofovir/emtricitabine versus abacavir/lamivudine in combination with boostedatazanavir versus efavirenz (in factorial design). Among adults with screening HIV-1 RNA 100,000 copiesper mL, the time to virologic failure and to first adverse event were both significantly shorter in patientsrandomly assigned to abacavir/lamivudine than in those assigned to tenofovir/emtricitabine. Results forpatients with lower entry viral loads and for comparisons by assignment to efavirenz or boosted atazanavirare not yet available. 122A study of 688 adults receiving lopinavir/ritonavir in addition to the randomized backbone of either tenofovir/emtricitabine or abacavir/lamivudine showed no difference in antiviral efficacy,safety, or tolerability at 48 weeks. 123In nonrandomized studies, 48-week virologic efficacy of tenofovir/emtricitabine in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir was similar to that seen in trials with otherdual-NRTI backbones in treatment-naive adults. 124Also, no difference in virologic response was demonstrated in a meta-analysis of combination regimens containing tenofovir or zidovudine. However,tenofovir-containing regimens demonstrated better immunologic response, adherence, and less resistance. 125 In some, but not all, studies, decreases in BMD have been observed in both adults and children takingtenofovir for 48 weeks. 114-117, 126, 127At this time, data are insufficient to recommend use of tenofovir as part of a preferred regimen for initial therapy in infected children in Tanner Stages 1 through 3, for whom the risk ofbone toxicity may be greatest. 114, 117(See Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for more detailed pediatric information.) Renal toxicity has been reported in children receiving tenofovir.128-131Given the potential for bone and renal toxicity, tenofovir may be more useful for treatment of children in whomother ARV drugs have failed than for initial therapy of treatment-naive younger children. Numerous drug-drug interactions with tenofovir and other ARV drugs, including didanosine, combinations with or didanosine , combination with and tenofovir in combination with lamivudine or emtricitabine in children and adolescents who are Tanner Stage 3 (as opposed to Tanner Stages 4 and 5, wherethis is a preferred dual-NRTI regimen) (BI*) . There is considerable experience with use of these dual-NRTI regimens in children, and in a large pediatric study, the combination of zidovudine and didanosine had the lowestrate of toxicities. 132However, zidovudine/abacavir and zidovudine/lamivudine had lower rates of viral suppression and more toxicity leading to drug modification than did abacavir/lamivudine in 1 European pediatricstudy. 99, 111The combination of didanosine and emtricitabine allows for once-daily dosing. In a study of 37 treatment-naive children aged 3 to 21 years, long-term virologic suppression was achieved with a once-daily regimen of didanosine, emtricitabine, and efavirenz; 72% of subjects maintained HIV RNA suppression to <50 copies/mL through 96 weeks of therapy.29Prescribing information for didanosine recommends administration on an empty stomach. However, this is impractical for infants who must be fed frequently and it may decrease medication adherence in older children because of the complexity of the regimen. A comparison of didanosine given with or without food in children found that systemic exposure was similar but with slower and more prolonged absorption with food.133To improve adherence, some practitioners recommend administration of didanosine without regard to timing of meals for young children. However, data are inadequate to allow a strong recommendation at this time, and it is preferable to administer didanosine under fasting conditions when possible. Dual-NRTI Regimens for Use in Special Circumstances The dual-NRTI combinations of stavudine with lamivudine or emtricitabine in children of any age are recommended for use in special circumstances. Stavudine is recommended for use only in special circumstances because the ARV is associated with a higher risk of lipoatrophy and hyperlactatemia than Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection G-14other NRTI drugs.134-136Children receiving dual-NRTI combinations containing stavudine had higher rates of clinical and laboratory toxicities than children receiving zidovudine-containing combinations.132In children with anemia in whom there are concerns related to abacavir hypersensitivity and who are too young to receive tenofovir, stavudine may be preferable to zidovudine for initial therapy because of its lowerincidence of hematologic toxicity. In children aged 2 who are prepubertal or in the early stages of puberty (Tanner Stages 1 and 2), tenofovir in combination with lamivudine or emtricitabine is also recommended for use in special circumstances. Asdiscussed above, the use of tenofovir during puberty when bone toxicity may be greatest may requirecaution. However, tenofovir may be a reasonable choice for initial therapy in children with demonstratedresistance to other NRTIs, co-infection with hepatitis B virus, or in those desiring a once-daily NRTI whereabacavir is not an option. The Panel awaits additional safety data, especially with the recently licensedpowder formulation, before providing a broader recommendation in younger children. Dual-NRTI Regimens Not Recommended Certain dual-NRTI drug combinations are not recommended. These include zidovudine plus stavudine becauseof virologic antagonism. The drug structure of emtricitabine is similar to lamivudine and the same singleresistance mutation confers cross resistance, so these drugs should not be used in combination. The dual-NRTIcombination of stavudine/didanosine is also not recommended for use as initial therapy because of potentiallygreater toxicity. In small pediatric studies, stavudine/didanosine demonstrated virologic efficacy and was welltolerated. 106, 107, 137However, in studies in adults, stavudine plus didanosine-based combination regimens were associated with neurotoxicity, pancreatitis, hyperlactatemia and lactic acidosis, zidovudine plus lamivudine; 139in addition, cases of fatal and nonfatal lactic acidosis with pancreatitis/hepatic steatosis have been reported in receiving this combination duringpregnancy. 134, 140Abacavir/didanosine, abacavir/tenofovir, and didanosine/tenofovir are not recommended as dual-NRTI backbones in initial therapy on the basis of insufficient data in children. All-NRTI Regimens Triple-NRTI regimens are attractive for use in HIV-infected pediatric patients as initial therapy because of theease of administration, availability of palatable liquid formulations, demonstrated tolerance, and avoidance ofmany drug interactions. Data on the efficacy of triple-NRTI regimens for treatment of ARV-naive children arelimited; in small observational studies, response rates of 47% to 50% have been reported. 141, 142In adult trials, these regimens have shown less potent virologic activity when compared with NNRTI- or PI-based regimens.Based on the results of these clinical trials, the Panel recommends that a three-NRTI-based regimen consistingof zidovudine plus lamivudine plus abacavir should be used only in special circumstances when a preferred oralternative NNRTI-based or PI-based regimen cannot be used as first-line therapy in treatment-naive children (such as because of significant drug interactions or concerns related to adherence) (BI*). Following is a discussion of findings in clinical trials of triple-NRTI regimens. Zidovudine + lamivudine + zidovudine + lamivudine + abacavir has been demonstrated to have virologic efficacy comparable to indinavir-143or nelfinavir-containing regimens144but was inferior to an efavirenz-based regimen.14, 145In a study of this regimen in previously treated children, the combination showed evidence of only modest viral suppression, with only 10% of 102 children maintaining a viral load of <400 copies/mL at 48 weeks of treatment.146 Other triple-NRTI regimens: Clinical trials in adults also have investigated triple-NRTI regimens consisting of stavudine + 148The virologic response to all these regimens was inferior to viral suppression achieved in comparator regimens. In addition, the M184V lamivudine drug-resistance mutation was seen more frequently Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection G-15in patients treated with triple-NRTI regimens containing didanosine + lamivudine demonstrate significantly increased rates of virologic failure and are notrecommended. 149-151The tenofovir + zidovudine + lamivudine combination demonstrated antiviral activity in adults; however, no comparative data are available and the regimen is not recommended.152 Regimens Not Recommended for Initial Therapy of Antiretroviral-Naive Children NotRecommended for Initial Therapy for Children Because of Insufficient Data A number of ARV drugs and drug regimens are not recommended for initial therapy of ARV-naive childrenbecause of insufficient pediatric data (AIII). These are summarized below. Regimens containing three drug classes: Data are insufficient to recommend initial regimens containing agents from three drug classes (e.g., NRTI plus NNRTI plus PI). Although efavirenz plus nelfinavir plus oneor two NRTIs was shown to be safe and effective in HIV-infected children with prior NRTI therapy, thisregimen was not studied as initial therapy in treatment-naive children and has the potential for inducingresistance to three drug classes, which could severely limit future treatment options. 30-32 Regimens containing three NRTIs and an NNRTI: Data are currently insufficient to recommend a regimen of three NRTIs plus an NNRTI in young infants. A recent review of nine cohorts from 13 Europeancountries contributed data on HIV-infected infants born from 1996 through 2008 who initiated therapy beforeage 12 months. Superior responses to this four-drug regimen were observed compared to boosted PI or three-drug NRTI regimens. 153It is speculated that poor tolerance and adherence to a PI-based regimen may account for differences. Based on demonstated benefits of recommended three-drug regimens and lack of additionalsafety and efficacy data on the four-drug regimen, the Panel currently does not recommend this regimen. New agents without sufficient pediatric data to recommend use as initial therapy (Tables 13 and 14 ): At this time several new agents that appear promising for use in adults do not have sufficient pediatric PKand safety data to recommend their use as components of an initial therapeutic regimen in children. Theseagents include maraviroc (a CCR5 Raltegravir is FDA-approved for treatment of HIV-1-infectedchildren aged 2 years and weight 10 kg. It is available in film-coated tablets and chewable tablets. Oralgranules for suspension are currently under investigation. Safety and efficacy data are promising, but at thistime, data are insufficient to recommend as initial therapy. 154-156In June 2008, FDA approved tipranavir boosted with ritonavir for use in treatment-experienced children aged 2 to 18 years; however, data areinsufficient to consider use of the agent for initial therapy. Elvitegravir, another integrase inhibitor, is onlyavailable as a fixed-dose combination tablet containing elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovirdisoproxil fumarate, and is FDA-approved for use as a complete ARV regimen in HIV-1-infected ARV treatment-naive adults. It is not FDA-approved for use in children aged <18 years. There are no data on its use in individuals younger than age 18 years, and it cannot be considered for use as initial therapy for children at this time (http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/203100s000lbl.pdf ). Enfuvirtide, a fusion inhibitor, is FDA-approved for use in combination with other ARV drugs to treat children aged 6 years who have evidence of HIV replication despite ongoing cART (that is, treatment- experienced children on nonsuppressive regimens). The drug must be administered subcutaneously twice daily and is associated with a high incidence of local injection site reactions (98%). Currently, data are insufficient to recommend use of enfuvirtide for initial therapy of children. Antiretroviral Drug Regimens that Should Never be Recommended (Table 9 ) Several ARV drugs and drug regimens are not recommended for use in therapy of children or adults. These are summarized below. Clinicians should be aware of the components of fixed-drug combinations so that Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection G-16patients do not inadvertently receive a double dose of a drug contained in such a combination. The following regimens or regimen components should never be offered to HIV-infected children: A single ARV drug (monotherapy) (AII) Two NRTIs alone (AI) Certain dual-NRTI combinations as part of a combination regimen: Lamivudine + emtricitabine because of similar resistance patterns and no additive benefit (AIII) Zidovudine + stavudine (AI*) Monotherapy: Therapy with a single ARV drug is not recommended for HIV treatment because monotherapy is unlikely to result in sustained viral suppression, leading to development of viral resistance tothe drug used and cross resistance to other drugs in the same drug class. However, use of zidovudine alone isappropriate for prophylaxis for the newborn of an HIV-infected mother. In this setting, 6 weeks ofmonotherapy with zidovudine is recommended for the infant. In the event the infant is identified as HIVinfected, zidovudine should be discontinued and standard triple therapy initiated. 140 In a child with treatment failure associated with drug resistance and persistent nonadherence, monotherapyusing an interim bridging regimen of lamivudine alone can be considered. Bridging regimens have beenreported to be effective in delaying immunologic decline in adults with failing combination therapy, oftenbecause of to nonadherence. 157, 158Bridging regimens should not be considered as initial therapy and should only be used in the interim as a clinician works intensively with the patient and caregivers to improveadherence before initiating a new, suppressive cART regimen (see Approach to the Management of Antiretroviral Treatment Failure ). Dual-nucleoside regimens alone: Dual-NRTI therapy alone is not recommended for initial therapy because it is unlikely to result in sustained viral suppression, leading to development of viral resistance to the drugsbeing used and cross resistance to other drugs within the same drug class. For children who have achievedviral suppression on a previously initiated dual-NRTI regimen, it is reasonable to either continue on thistherapy or to add a PI or a NNRTI to the regimen. However, a child remaining on a dual-NRTI regimen should be switched to a 3-or-more drug combination if viral rebound occurs (see Management of Treatment- Experienced Infants, Children, and Adolescents ). Certain dual-nucleoside backbone Certain dual-NRTI combinations (zidovudine + stavudine, emtricitabine + lamivudine) are not recommended for therapy at any time because of antagonism or inferior virologic response. Emtricitabine should not be used in combination with lamivudine because the NRTIs share a similar drug structure and the same single resistance mutation (M184V) induces resistance to both drugs. Dual NNRTIs: An adult study (2NN) demonstrated increased toxicity with the combination of nevirapine plus efavirenz.24 Certain PIs: The combination of atazanavir darunavir, and tipranivir have low bioavailablity and do not achieve adequate drug levels; therefore, they should not be used without ritonavir boosting. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection G-17Three-NRTI regimen of tenofovir + (didanosine or abacavir) + (didanosine or abacavir) plus (lamivudine or emtricitabine) have a high rate of early virologic nonresponse when used as initial therapy in treatment-naive adults and are notrecommended as combination therapy for children at any time. 149-151 Table 8. ARV Regimens Recommended for Initial Therapy for HIV Infection in Children (page 1 of 2) A combination ARV regimen in treatment-naive children generally contains 1 NNRTI plus a 2-NRTIbackbone or 1 PI plus a 2-NRTI backbone.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection G-39Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection H-1Monitoring of Children on Antiretroviral Therapy (Last updated November 1, 2012; last reviewed November 1, 2012) Children who start antiretroviral therapy (ART) or who change to a new regimen should be followed to assess effectiveness, tolerability, and side effects of the regimen and to evaluate medication adherence. Frequent patientvisits and intensive follow-up during the initial months after a new antiretroviral (ARV) regimen is started arenecessary to support and educate the family. The first few weeks of ART can be particularly difficult for childrenand their caregivers. They must adjust their schedules to allow for consistent and routine administration ofmedication doses. Children may also experience side effects of medications, and both children and theircaregivers need assistance to determine whether the effects are temporary and can be tolerated or are moreserious or long-term and require a visit to the clinician. Thus, it is prudent for clinicians to assess children within1 to 2 weeks of initiating therapy, either in person or with a phone call, to ensure that medications are beingadministered properly and evaluate clinical concerns. Many clinicians schedule additional contact (in person orover the telephone) with children and their caregivers during the first few weeks of therapy to supportadherence. It is critical that providers speak to caregivers and children in a supportive manner using layman'sterms. This promotes honest report(s) and ensures dialogue between providers and both children and their caregiver(s), even when medication adherence is reported to be inconsistent. Baseline laboratory assessments including CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4 cell) count/percentage and HIV RNA level, complete blood count (CBC) and differential, serum chemistries (including electrolytes, blood calcium, and phosphorus), urinalysis, and serum lipid evaluation (cholesterol, triglycerides) should be done before initiation of therapy. A baseline assessment of ARV resistance using a genotype assay also is recommended (see Antiretroviral Resistance Testing ). Within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating or changing therapy, children receiving ART should be seen to obtain a clinical history, with focus on potential adverse effects of ARVs and adherence to medications; to receive a physical examination; and to receive laboratory tests to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy (CD4 count/percentage, plasma HIV RNA level [viral load]) and to detect medication-related toxicities. At a minimum, laboratory assessments should include a CBC and differential, serum chemistries, and assessments of renal and hepatic function. After a change in therapy, more frequent evaluation may be needed to supportPanel's Recommendations Within 1 to 2 weeks after starting a new antiretroviral (ARV) regimen, children should be evaluated to screen for clinical side effects and to ensure patient and caretaker adherence to the regimen (AIII). Evaluations can be conducted in person or over the phone. After starting or changing therapy, more frequent evaluation may be needed to support adherence to the regimen (AIII). At least every 3 to 4 months thereafter, children should have a monitoring evaluation to assess both effectiveness and potential toxicity of their ARV regimens (AII*). Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in childrenwith long-term outcomes; II* = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adults with long-term clinical outcomes with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = expert opinion Studies that include children or children and adolescents but not studies limited to postpubertal adolescentsadherence to the regimen. Assessment of initial virologic response to therapy is important because an initial decrease in HIV viral load in response to ART should be observed after 4 to 8 weeks of therapy. Thereafter, medication adherence and regimen toxicity and effectiveness should be assessed every 3 to 4 monthsin children taking ARV drugs. Some experts monitor CD4 cell counts and HIV RNA levels less frequently inchildren and youth who are adherent to therapy and have sustained viral suppression and stable clinical status formore than 2 to 3 years. Table 15 provides one proposed monitoring schedule, which should be adjusted based on the specific therapy a child is receiving. Assessments should include basic hematology, chemistry, CD4 cellcount/percentage, and HIV viral load. Monitoring of drug toxicities should be tailored to the particularmedications the child is taking; for example, periodic monitoring of urinalysis and serum creatinine may bedesirable in children receiving tenofovir, or of serum glucose and lipids in patients receiving protease inhibitors(PIs). Children who develop symptoms of toxicity should have appropriate laboratory evaluations (such asevaluation of serum lactate in a child receiving nucleoside drugs whodevelops symptoms suspicious for lactic acidosis) performed more frequently until the toxicity resolves. For further details of adverse effects associated with a particular ARV , see Tables 17a-17l. Antiretroviral Therapy-Associated Adverse Effects and Management Recommendations . Based on accumulated experience with currently available assays, viral suppression is currently defined as anHIV RNA level below the detection limit of the assay used (generally <20-75 copies/mL). This definition ofsuppression has been much more thoroughly investigated in HIV-infected adults than in HIV-infected children(see Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents ).1Temporary viral load elevations or \"blips\" between the level of detection and 1,000 copies/mL often are detected in adults (andchildren) on ART and should not be considered \"virologic failure.\" For definitions and management of virologictreatment failure, see Management of Treatment-Experienced Infants, Children, and Adolescents .

Many clinicians will plan additional contacts(in person or by telephone) with children and caregivers to support adherence during the first few weeks of therapy. Someclinicians also recommend an HIV RNA measurement within the initial weeks of therapy for early assessment ofresponse/adherence to therapy. 3For children who are in a stable treatment status (non-detectable HIV RNA and normal CD4 count/percentage for at least 12months) many clinicians are considering 6-month intervals between monitoring lab tests. Some clinicians find value in visitsevery 3 months even when lab testing is not performed (such as to review adherence and update dosing for interim growth). 4Some ARV drugs, such as nevirapine and tenofovir, require a specific schedule frequency based on toxicity profile (seespecific antiretroviral agents). 5In children receiving nevirapine, serum transaminase levels should be measured every 2 weeks for the first 4 weeks oftherapy, then monthly for 3 months, and every 3 to 4 months thereafter. 6Some clinicians do not recommend a CD4 cell count/percentage at this time, considering it too early to expect an immunologicresponse.

Accessed on August 17, 2012.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection I-1Specific Issues in Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV-Infected Adolescents (Last updated November 1, 2012; last reviewed November 1, 2012) Background An increasing number of HIV-infected children who acquired HIV infection through perinatal transmission are now surviving into adolescence. They generally have had a long clinical course and extensive antiretroviral therapy (ART) treatment history.1Adolescents with non-perinatally acquired HIV infection generally follow a clinical course similar to that in adults. Because non-perinatally infected adolescents are usually at the initial stages of their HIV disease, they are potential candidates for early intervention and treatment.2 Dosing of Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV-Infected Adolescents Puberty is a time of somatic growth and sexual maturation, with females developing more body fat and males more muscle mass. These physiologic changes may affect drug pharmacokinetics (PK), which is especially important for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index that are used in combination with protein-bound medicines or hepatic enzyme inducers or inhibitors.3Dosages of medications for HIV infection andPanel's Recommendations Antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens must be individually tailored to the adolescent (AIII). Appropriate dosing of ART for adolescents is complex, not always predictable, and dependent upon multiple factors, including body mass and composition and pubertal development (AII). Effective and appropriate methods should be selected to reduce the likelihood of unintended pregnancy and to prevent secondary transmission of HIV to sexual partners (AI). Providers should be aware of potential interactions between ART and hormonal contraceptives, which could lower contraceptive efficacy (AII*). Alternative regimens that do not include efavirenz should be strongly considered in adolescent females who are trying to conceive or who are not using effective and consistent contraception because of the potential for teratogenicity with first- trimester efavirenz exposure, assuming these alternative regimens are acceptable to the provider and will notcompromise the woman's health (BIII). Adolescent girls who require treatment with efavirenz should undergo pregnancy testing before initiation of treatment and receive counseling about potential fetal risk and desirability of avoiding pregnancy while receiving efavirenz-containingregimens (AIII). Pediatric and adolescent care providers should prepare adolescents for the transition into adult care settings (AIII). Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in childrenwith long-term outcomes; II* = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adults with long-term clinical outcomes with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = expert opinion Studies that include children or children and adolescents but not studies limited to postpubertal adolescentsopportunistic infections are prescribed according to Tanner staging of puberty4rather than strictly on the basis of age.2Using the Tanner method, adolescents in early puberty (i.e., Tanner stages I and II) are administered doses using pediatric schedules, whereas those in late puberty (i.e., Tanner stage V) are administered doses using adult schedules. However, Tanner stage and age are not necessarily directlypredictive of drug PK, and dosing of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs during Tanner stages III and IV may be morechallenging. Puberty may be delayed in children who were infected with HIV perinatally, 5adding to discrepancies between Tanner stage-based and age-based dosing, although delayed onset of puberty appearsto be uncommon in those in whom potent combination ART was initiated at an early age. 6 Many ARV drugs (e.g., abacavir, emtricitabine, lamivudine, tenofovir, and some protease inhibitors children at higher weight- or surface area-based doses than would be predicted by directextrapolation of adult doses. This is based upon reported PK data indicating more rapid drug clearance inchildren. Continued use of these pediatric weight- or surface area-based doses as a child grows duringadolescence can result in medication doses that are higher than the usual adult doses. Data suggestingoptimal doses for every ARV drug in adolescents are not available. Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information includes a discussion of data relevant to adolescents for individual drugs and notes the age listed on the drug label for adult dosing, when available. Adolescent Contraception, Pregnancy, and Antiretroviral Therapy HIV-infected adolescents may be sexually active regardless of how they acquired the virus. Reproductiveplans including preconception care, contraception methods, and safer sex techniques for prevention ofsecondary HIV transmission should be discussed with them regularly (see U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use ).7For additional information please see Health and Human Services (HHS) Recommendations for Use of Antiretroviral Drugs in Pregnant HIV-1-Infected Women for Maternal Health and Interventions to Reduce Perinatal HIV Transmission in the United States (Preconception Care and Reproductive Options for HIV-Concordant and Serodiscordant Couples section).8 The possibility of an unplanned pregnancy should also be considered when selecting an ART regimen for anadolescent female. The most vulnerable period in fetal organogenesis is early in gestation, often beforepregnancy is recognized. In addition, concerns about specific ARV drugs and birth defects should beaddressed immediately to preclude misinterpretations or lack of adherence by adolescents with unexpressedplans for pregnancy. 9For additional information please see HHS Recommendations for Use of Antiretroviral Drugs in Pregnant HIV-1-Infected Women for Maternal Health and Interventions to Reduce Perinatal HIV Transmission in the United States (Special Considerations Regarding the Use of Antiretroviral Drugs by HIV-Infected Pregnant Women and their Infants: Teratogenicity section).8Alternative regimens that do not include efavirenz should be strongly considered in adolescent females who are trying to conceive or who are not using effective and consistent contraception because of the potential for teratogenicity with first-trimester efavirenz exposure, assuming these alternative regimens are acceptable to the provider and will not compromise the woman's health. Contraceptive-Antiretroviral Drug Interactions Several PI and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) drugs alter metabolism of oral contraceptives, resulting in possible decreases in ethinyl estradiol or increases in estradiol or norethindrone levels (see the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents available at http://aidsinfo.nih.gov ) (http://www.hiv-druginteractions.org/ ).10-12These changes may decrease the effectiveness of the oral contraceptives or potentially increase the risk of estrogen- or progestin-related adverse effects. Some newer agents, such as integrase inhibitors (specifically raltegravir), appear to have no interaction with estrogen-based contraceptives.13Providers should be aware of these drug interactions and consider alternative or additional contraceptive methods for patients receiving ART with such interactions. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection I-2Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection I-3Whether interactions with ART would compromise the contraceptive effectiveness of progestogen-only injectable contraceptives (such as depot medoxyprogesterone acetate [DMPA]) is unknown because thesemethods produce higher blood hormone levels than other progestogen-only oral contraceptives and combinedoral contraceptives. In one study, the efficacy of DMPA was not altered in women receiving concomitantnelfinavir-, efavirenz-, or nevirapine-based treatment, with no evidence of ovulation during concomitantadministration for 3 months, no additional adverse effects, and no clinically significant changes in ARV druglevels. 14, 15At this time, concerns about loss of bone mineral density (BMD) with long-term use of DMPA with or without ART (specifically tenofovir)16should not preclude use of DMPA as an effective contraceptive. However, more active monitoring of BMD in young women on DMPA may need to beconsidered. 16Minimal information exists about drug interactions with use of newer hormonal contraceptive methods (e.g., the patch and vaginal ring).17Intrauterine device (IUD) use while on ART is not restricted by current guidelines; however, IUD users with AIDS should be closely monitored for pelvic infection.7 Adolescents who want to become pregnant should be referred for preconception counseling and care,including discussion of special considerations with ART use during pregnancy (see HHS Recommendations for Use of Antiretroviral Drugs in Pregnant HIV-1-Infected Women for Maternal Health and Interventions to Reduce Perinatal HIV Transmission in the United States available at http://aidsinfo.nih.gov ).8 HIV-Infected Pregnant Adolescents and Outcomes Pregnancy should not preclude the use of optimal therapeutic regimens. However, because of considerationsrelated to prevention of perinatal transmission and maternal and fetal safety, timing of initiation of treatmentand selection of regimens may be different for pregnant women than for nonpregnant adults or adolescents.Details regarding choice of ART regimen in pregnant HIV-infected women, including adolescents, areprovided in HHS Recommendations for Use of Antiretroviral Drugs in Pregnant HIV-1-Infected Women for Maternal Health and Interventions to Reduce Perinatal HIV Transmission in the United States available at http://aidsinfo.nih.gov .8Although information is limited about the pregnancies of adolescents who were HIV- infected perinatally, perinatal HIV transmission outcomes in this population appear similar to those in adultcohorts; 18-21however, there may be differences in pregnancy-related morbidities. Kenny et al22reported pregnancy outcomes from the United Kingdom and Ireland in a group of 30 adolescents who wereperinatally HIV-infected or who acquired HIV infection at a young age. Few of these pregnancies wereplanned and in many cases, the partner was unaware of the mother's HIV status. Rates of electivetermination, miscarriage, and prematurity were high. The rate of prematurity was twice that in the generaladolescent population of Europe. Many of the women had an AIDS diagnosis before pregnancy, but only oneinfant was HIV-infected. Although the rate of perinatal transmission is reassuring, this study highlights someof the major challenges in caring for pregnant, perinatally HIV-infected youth. Comparisons of pregnancy incidence and outcomes between perinatally infected and non-perinatally infected youth are few and may offer special insight into the effects of prolonged HIV infection on pregnancy-related sequelae. Agwu et al 23retrospectively evaluated pregnancies at four clinics. Non-perinatally infected youth were more likely to have one or more pregnancies despite similar age at first pregnancy between groups. They also appeared to have more premature births and spontaneous abortions, but that is tempered by the fact that the perinatally infected youth were more likely to have an elective termination. The perinatal transmission rate for the entire cohort was 1.5%. Similar results were found in several other studies.24, 25 However, in a single-center review of perinatal versus non-perinatal birth outcomes, infants born to women with perinatal HIV infection were more likely to be small for gestational age, indicating the potential for future adverse health outcomes.26 Transition of Adolescents into Adult HIV Care Settings Facilitating a smooth transition of adolescents with chronic health conditions from their pediatric/adolescent medical home to adult care can be difficult and is especially challenging for HIV-infected adolescents.Transition is described as \"a multifaceted, active process that attends to the medical, psychosocial, and educational or vocational needs of adolescents as they move from the child-focused to the adult-focused health-care system.\" 27Care models for children and adolescents with perinatally acquired HIV tend to be family-centered, consisting of a multidisciplinary team that often includes pediatric or adolescent physicians,nurses, social workers, and mental health professionals. These providers generally have long-standingrelationships with patients and their families, and care is rendered in discreet, more intimate settings. Althoughexpert care is also provided under the adult HIV care medical model, an adolescent may be unfamiliar with themore individual-centered, busier clinics typical of adult medical providers and uncomfortable with providerswith whom he or she often does not have a long-standing relationship. Providing an adolescent and an adultmedical care provider with support and guidance regarding expectations for each partner in the patient-providerrelationship may be helpful. In this situation, it may also be helpful for a pediatric and an adult provider toshare joint care of a patient for a period of time. Providers should also have a candid discussion with atransitioning adolescent to understand what qualities the adolescent considers most important in a provider(such as confidentiality, small clinic size, after-school appointments). Some general guidelines abouttransitional plans and who might benefit most from them are available. 28-32Pediatric and adolescent providers should have a formal plan to transition adolescents to adult care. Outcomes are variable in young adult patients transitioned to adult care. Definitions of \"successfultransition\" have ranged from the ability to maintain a certain level of follow-up in the new clinic, tolaboratory measures of stability, to comparisons of younger and older adult patients. 33-35Factors that should be taken into consideration during transition include social determinants such as developmental status,behavioural/mental health issues, housing, family support, employment, recent discharge from foster care,peer pressure, illicit drug use, and incarceration. Currently there is no definitive model of transition to adultcare, but in one study, adherence to medical visits just prior to the transition was predictive of successfultransfer. 33Psychiatric co-morbidities and their effective management also predict adherence to medical care and therapy.36, 37With more perinatally infected children surviving into adulthood, transitioning these patients to adult care settings remains challenging.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection I-6Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection J-1Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV-Infected Children and Adolescents (Last updated November 1, 2012; last reviewed November 1, 2012) Background Adherence is a determinant of viral suppression and fundamental to successful antiretroviral therapy (ART).1-4 Prospective adult and pediatric studies have shown a direct correlation between risk of virologic failure and proportion of missed doses of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs.5Based on early work in populations of adults primarily being treated with nonboosted protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimens,295% adherence has been the threshold associated with complete viral suppression. Recent findings from adult populations suggest that the relationship between ARV adherence and viral suppression may vary with individual drug, drug class, andpattern of adherence. 6Viral suppression can be achieved with lower levels of adherence when using boosted PI and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor regimens.6, 7In patients who achieve suppression, the longer the duration of suppression the lower the level of adherence necessary to prevent viral rebound.8Different patterns of inadequate adherence (intermittent missed doses, treatment interruptions) may have a differential impact on regimen efficacy, depending on the drug combination.9, 10 Subtherapeutic ARV drug levels resulting from poor adherence may facilitate development of drug resistance to one or more drugs in a given regimen, and possibly cross-resistance to other drugs in the same class. Multiple factors (including regimen potency, pharmacokinetics, viral fitness, and the genetic barrier to ARV resistance) influence the adherence-resistance relationship.11In addition to compromising the efficacy of the current regimen, suboptimal adherence has implications for limiting future effective drug regimens in patients who develop drug-resistant viral strains and in transmission of HIV to sexual partners. Panel's Recommendations Strategies to maximize adherence should be discussed before initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and again before changing regimens (AIII). Adherence to therapy must be stressed at each visit, along with continued exploration of strategies to maintain and/or improve adherence (AIII). At least one method of measuring adherence to ART (such as quantitative and/or qualitative self-report, pharmacy refill checks, pill counts) should be used in addition to monitoring viral load (AII). When feasible, once-daily antiretroviral regimens should be prescribed (AI*). To improve and support adherence, providers should maintain a nonjudgmental attitude, establish trust with patients/caregivers, and identify mutually acceptable goals for care (AII*). Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in childrenwith long-term outcomes; II* = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adults with long-term clinical outcomes with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = expert opinion Studies that include children or children and adolescents but not studies limited to postpubertal adolescentsEvidence indicates that adherence problems are common in children and adolescents. Multiple studies have reported that fewer than 50% of children and/or caretakers reported full adherence to prescribed regimens.Rates of adherence varied with method of ascertainment (parent/child report, pharmacy records), ARVregimens, and study characteristics. 3, 4, 12-14A variety of factors, including medication formulation, frequency of dosing, child age, and psychosocial and behavioral characteristics of children and parents, have beenassociated with adherence; however, no clear predictors of either good or poor adherence in children havebeen consistently identified. 12, 15-19Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated that adherence is not static and can vary with time on treatment.20These findings illustrate the difficulty of maintaining high levels of adherence and underscore the need to work in partnership with families to make adherence education,support, and assessment integral components of care. Specific Adherence Issues in Children Adherence is a complex health behavior that is influenced by the regimen prescribed, patient and familyfactors, and characteristics of health care providers. 17Limited availability of palatable formulations for young children is especially problematic.5, 21Furthermore, infants and children are dependent on others for administration of medication; thus, assessment of the capacity for adherence to a complex multidrug regimenrequires evaluation of the caregivers and their environments, as well as the ability and willingness of a child totake the drug. Barriers faced by adult caregivers that can contribute to nonadherence in children includeforgetting doses, changes in routine, being too busy, and child refusal. 22, 23Some caregivers may place too much responsibility for managing medications on older children before the children are developmentally ableto take on such tasks, 24 whereas others may face health and adherence challenges related to HIV infection or other medical conditions. Many other barriers to adherence exist for HIV-infected children. For example,caregivers' unwillingness to disclose a child's HIV infection status to the child and to others may createspecific problems, including reluctance of caregivers to fill prescriptions locally, hiding or relabeling ofmedications to maintain secrecy within the household, avoidance of social support, and a tendency for doses tobe missed if the parent is unavailable. Furthermore, adherence also may be jeopardized by social issues withina family, such as illicit substance abuse, unstable housing, and involvement with the criminal justice system. Specific Adherence Issues in Adolescents HIV-infected adolescents also face specific adherence challenges.25, 26Several studies have identified pill burden as well as lifestyle issues (that is, not having medications on hand when away from home, change inschedule) as barriers to complete adherence. 15, 27Denial and fear of their HIV infection is common in adolescents, especially youth who have been recently diagnosed; this may lead to refusal to initiate orcontinue ART. Distrust of the medical establishment, misinformation about HIV , and lack of knowledgeabout the availability and effectiveness of ARV treatments all can be barriers to linking adolescents to care and maintaining successful ART. Perinatally infected youth are familiar with the challenges of taking complex drug regimens and with the routine of chronic medical care; nevertheless, they may have long histories of inadequate adherence. Regimen fatigue also has been identified as a barrier to adherence in adolescents. 28Regardless of the mode of acquisition of HIV infection, HIV-infected adolescents may suffer from low self-esteem, have unstructured and chaotic lifestyles and concomitant mental illnesses, or may cope poorly with their illness because of lack of familial and social support. Depression, alcohol or substance abuse, poor school attendance, and advanced HIV disease all correlate with nonadherence.25, 29In a study of 833 HIV-infected Medicaid beneficiaries aged 12 to 17 years, youth diagnosed with a psychiatric comorbidity (substance abuse, conduct disorder, or emotional disorder) were less likely to be receiving combination therapy; however, for those on therapy, only a conduct disorder diagnosis was associated with poorer adherence.30In a cross-sectional study of youth perinatally infected with HIV , no significant differences in the frequency of mental health disorders were found between adherent and nonadherent participants.31A review of published papers on adherence among HIV-infected youth, however, suggests that Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection J-2Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection J-3depression and anxiety have been consistently associated with poorer adherence.29Adherence to complex regimens is particularly challenging at a time of life when adolescents do not want to be different from their peers. Further difficulties face adolescents who live with parents or partners to whom they have not yetdisclosed their HIV status and adolescents who are homeless and have no place to store medicine. Whenrecommending treatment regimens for adolescents, clinicians must balance the goal of prescribing amaximally potent ARV regimen with realistic assessment of existing and potential support systems tofacilitate adherence. Interventions to promote long-term adherence to ART have not been rigorously evaluated in adolescents. In clinical practice, reminder systems, such as beepers, cellphones, and alarm devices, are well accepted bysome youth. Small, inconspicuous pillboxes may be useful for storing medications in an organized fashion.In a pilot study evaluating peer support and pager messaging in an adult population, peer support wasassociated with greater self-reported adherence post-intervention; however, the effect was not sustained atfollow-up. Although pager messaging was not associated with reported adherence, improved biologicoutcomes were measured. 32Another study evaluating the efficacy of a 4-session, individual, clinic-based motivational interviewing intervention targeting multiple risk behaviors in HIV-infected youth demonstratedan association with lower viral load at 6 months in youth taking ART. However, reduction in viral load wasnot maintained at 9 months. 33 Adherence Assessment and Monitoring The process of adherence preparation and assessment should begin before therapy is initiated or changed. Aroutine adherence assessment should be incorporated into every clinic visit. A comprehensive assessmentshould be instituted for all children in whom ART initiation or change is considered. Evaluations shouldinclude nursing, social, and behavioral assessments of factors that may affect adherence by children and theirfamilies and can be used to identify individual needs for intervention. Adherence preparation should focus onestablishing a dialogue and a partnership with a child and family regarding medication management.Specific, open-ended questions should be used to elicit information about past experience as well as concernsand expectations about treatment. When assessing readiness and preparing to begin treatment, it is importantto obtain a patient's explicit agreement with the treatment plan, including strategies to support adherence.Also, it is important to alert patients to minor side effects of ARV drugs, such as nausea, headaches, andabdominal discomfort that may recede over time or respond to change in diet or method and timing ofmedication administration. Adherence is difficult to assess accurately; different methods of assessment have yielded different results, and each approach has limitations. 14, 34, 35Both caregivers and health care providers often overestimate adherence. Use of multiple methods to assess adherence is recommended.35, 36Viral load response to a new regimen is often the most accurate indication of adherence, but it may be a less valuable measure in children with long treatment histories and multidrug-resistant virus. Other measures include quantitative self report of missed doses by caregivers and children or adolescents (focusing on recent missed doses during a 3-day or 1- week period), descriptions of the medication regimens, and reports of barriers to administration of medications. Caregivers may report number of doses taken more accurately than doses missed.37Also, targeted questions about stress, pill burden, and daily routine are recommended.38, 39Pharmacy refill checks and pill counts can identify adherence problems not evident from self-reports.40Electronic monitoring devices, such as Medication Event Monitoring System caps, which are equipped with a computer chip that records each opening of a medication bottle, have been shown to be useful tools to measure adherence in some settings.41-43Mobile phone technologies, such as interactive voice response and text messaging, are being evaluated to quantify missed doses and provide real-time feedback on adherence to caregivers, but studies in the pediatric population are in the pilot phase.44Home visits can play an important role in assessing adherence. In some cases, suspected nonadherence is confirmed only when dramatic clinical responses toART occur during hospitalizations or in other supervised settings. Preliminary studies suggest that monitoring plasma concentrations of PIs, or therapeutic drug monitoring, may be a useful method to identifynonadherence 45and drug concentrations in hair are now being studied as an alternative method to measure adherence.46, 47 It is important for clinicians to recognize that nonadherence is a common problem and that it can be difficultfor patients to share information about missed doses or difficulties adhering to treatment. Furthermore,adherence can change over time. An adolescent who was able to strictly adhere to treatment upon initiationof a regimen may not be able to maintain complete adherence over time. A nonjudgmental attitude andtrusting relationship foster open communication and facilitate assessment. To obtain information onadherence in older children, it is often helpful to ask both the HIV-infected children and their caregiversabout missed doses and problems. Their reports may differ significantly; therefore, clinical judgment isrequired to best interpret adherence information obtained from the multiple sources. 48 Strategies to Improve and Support Adherence Intensive follow-up is required, particularly during the critical first few months after therapy is started.Patients should be seen frequently, as often as weekly during the first month of treatment, to assessadherence and determine the need for strategies to improve and support adherence. Strategies includedevelopment of patient-focused treatment plans to accommodate specific patient needs, integration ofmedication administration into the daily routines of life (such as associating medication administration withdaily activities such as brushing teeth), and use of social and community support services. Multifacetedapproaches that include regimen-related strategies; educational, behavioral, and supportive strategies focusedon children and families; and strategies that focus on health care providers\u2014rather than one specificintervention\u2014may be most effective. 24, 49, 50Programs designed for administration of directly observed combination therapy to adults in either the clinic or at home have demonstrated successful results in both theUnited States and in international, resource-poor settings. 51-53Modified directly observed therapy (m-DOT), where one dose is administered in a supervised setting and the remaining doses are self-administered,appears to be both feasible and acceptable. 49, 54However, a recent meta-analysis of 10 randomized clinical trials evaluating DOT to promote adherence in adults found that it was no more effective than self-administered treatment. 55In another meta-analysis of DOT studies, DOT was found to have a demonstrated effect on virologic, immunologic, and adherence outcomes, but efficacy of the strategy was not supportedwhen the analysis was restricted to randomized controlled trials. 56Table 16 summarizes some of the strategies that can be used to support and improve adherence to ARV medications. Regimen-Related Strategies ARV regimens often require administration of large numbers of pills or unpalatable liquids, each with potential side effects and drug interactions, in multiple daily doses. To the extent possible, regimens should be simplified with respect to the number of pills or volume of liquid prescribed, as well as frequency of therapy, and chosen to minimize drug interactions and side effects.57When nonadherence is a problem, addressing medication-related issues, such as side effects, may result in improvement. If a regimen is overly complex, it can be simplified. For example, when the burden of pills is great, one or more drugs can be changed to result in a regimen containing fewer pills and potentially greater adherence. When feasible, once- daily regimens should be prescribed. Several studies in adults have demonstrated better adherence with once-daily versus twice-daily ARV regimens.58-61When nonadherence is related to poor palatability of a liquid formulation or crushed pills and simultaneous administration of food is not contraindicated, the offending taste can be masked with a small amount of flavoring syrup or food (see Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information ) or a child can be taught to swallow pills in order to overcome medication aversion.62 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection J-4Child/Family-Related Strategies The primary approach taken by the clinical team to promote medication adherence in children is patient and caregiver education. Educating families about adherence should begin before ARV medications are initiatedor changed and should include a discussion of the goals of therapy, the reasons for making adherence apriority, and the specific plans for supporting and maintaining a child's medication adherence. Caregiversshould understand that the first ARV regimen has the best chance of long-term success. Caregiver adherenceeducation strategies should include the provision of both information and adherence tools, such as writtenand visual materials; a daily schedule illustrating times and doses of medications; and demonstration of theuse of syringes, medication cups, and pillboxes. A number of behavioral tools can be used to integrate taking medications into an HIV-infected child's daily routine. The use of behavior modification techniques, especially the application of positive reinforcementsand the use of small incentives for taking medications, can be effective tools to promote adherence. 63, 64 Training children to swallow pills has been associated with improved adherence at 6 months post-training ina small study of children aged 4 to 21 years. 65Availability of mental health services and treatment of mental health disorders also may facilitate adherence to complex ARV regimens. A gastrostomy tube can beconsidered for nonadherent children who are at risk of disease progression and who have severe andpersistent aversion to taking medications. 66If adequate resources are available, home nursing interventions also may be beneficial.67Directly observed dosing of ARV medications has been implemented in adults, adolescents, and children, using home nursing services as well as daily medication administration in theclinic setting. Other strategies to support adherence that have been employed in the clinical setting includesetting patients' cell phone alarms to go off at medication times; providing pill boxes and other adherencesupport tools; weekly filling of pill boxes by nursing or pharmacy staff, particularly for patients withcomplex regimens; and home delivery of medications. Two recent studies conducted in adults in Kenyafound that individuals who received cell phone text messages had significantly improved ART adherence. Inone study, ART-naive adults initiating treatment received weekly short message service (SMS) from a clinicnurse and were required to respond. 68Self-reported adherence and rates of HIV-1 viral suppression at 12 months were significantly greater in individuals randomized to SMS compared with standard-of-careadherence support. Similarly, in second study, adult participants who received weekly SMS reminders weremore likely to achieve high levels of adherence and less likely to experience treatment interruptions. 69 Health Care Provider-Related Strategies Providers have the ability to improve adherence through their relationships with families. This processbegins early in a provider's relationship with a family, when the clinician obtains explicit agreement aboutthe medication and treatment plan and any further strategies to support adherence. Fostering a trustingrelationship and engaging in open communication are particularly important. 70, 71Provider characteristics that have been associated with improved patient adherence in adults include consistency, giving information, asking questions, technical expertise, and commitment to follow-up. Creating an environment in the health care setting that is child-centered and includes caregivers in adherence support also has been shown to improve treatment outcomes.72 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection J-5Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection J-6Initial Intervention Strategies Establish trust and identify mutually acceptable goals for care. Obtain explicit agreement on need for treatment and adherence. Identify depression, low self-esteem, substance abuse, or other mental health issues for the child/adolescent and/or caregiver that may decrease adherence. Treat mental health issues before starting antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, if possible. Identify family, friends, health team members, or others who can support adherence. Educate patient and family about the critical role of adherence in therapy outcome. Specify the adherence target: 95% of prescribed doses. Educate patient and family about the relationship between partial adherence and resistance. Educate patient and family about resistance and constraint of later choices of ARV drug (that is, explain that although a failure of adherence may be temporary, the effects on treatment choice may be permanent). Develop a treatment plan that the patient and family understand and to which they feel committed. Establish readiness to take medication by practice sessions or other means. Consider a brief period of hospitalization at start of therapy in selected circumstances for patient education and to assess tolerability of medications chosen. Medication Strategies Choose the simplest regimen possible, reducing dosing frequency and number of pills. Choose a regimen with dosing requirements that best conform to the daily and weekly routines and variations in patient and family activities. Choose the most palatable medicine possible (pharmacists may be able to add syrups or flavoring agents to increase palatability). Choose drugs with the fewest side effects; provide anticipatory guidance for management of side effects. Simplify food requirements for medication administration. Prescribe drugs carefully to avoid adverse drug-drug interactions. Assess pill-swallowing capacity and offer pill-swallowing training. Follow-up Intervention Strategies Monitor adherence at each visit and in between visits by telephone or letter as needed. Provide ongoing support, encouragement, and understanding of the difficulties associated with demands to attain 95% adherence with medication doses. Use patient education aids including pictures, calendars, and stickers. Encourage use of pill boxes, reminders, alarms, pagers, and timers. Provide follow-up clinic visits, telephone calls, and text messages to support and assess adherence. Provide access to support groups, peer groups, or one-on-one counseling for caregivers and patients, especially for those with known depression or drug use issues that are known to decrease adherence. Provide pharmacist-based adherence support, such as medication education and counseling, refill reminders, and home delivery of medications. Consider gastrostomy tube use in selected circumstances. Consider directly observed therapy (DOT) at home, in the clinic, or during a brief inpatient hospitalization.Table 16. Strategies to Improve Adherence to Antiretroviral MedicationsReferences 1.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection J-11Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection K-1Management of Medication Toxicity or Intolerance (Last updated November 1, 2012; last reviewed November 1, 2012) Overview Side effects from or intolerance to antiretroviral (ARV) agents are common in children and should prompt a re-evaluation of the ARV regimen. Drug-related toxicity can be acute, occurring soon after a drug has been administered; subacute, occurring within 1 to 2 days of administration; or late, occurring after prolonged drug administration. For some ARV medications, pharmacogenetic markers associated with risk of early treatment discontinuation because of toxicity have been identified, but the only such screen in clinical use is HLA B*5701 as a marker for abacavir hypersensitivity.1The differential diagnosis of drug toxicity includes toxicity due to HIV infection or other infections or conditions, bone marrow suppression with disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection, and anemia due to blood loss from cytomegalovirus colitis. ARV drug-related adverse events can vary in severity from mild to severe and life threatening (see Tables 17a-17l. Antiretroviral Therapy-Associated Adverse Effects and Management Recommendations ). Identification of the responsible agent may allow for substitution of a similar agent that recent HIV drug- resistance testing predicts will be active against a patient's virus. Knowledge of a patient's ARV history and viral resistance profile before the current course of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is essential. Any new agent used should be assessed for likely effectiveness against a patient's virus and for possible interactions with other medications the patient will take. Experience with ARV drugs has led to the recognition of several types of distinct adverse drug effects that may be most common with certain ARV drugs or drug classes (see Tables 17a-17l. Antiretroviral Therapy- Associated Adverse Effects and Management Recommendations ). Physicians, patients, and caregivers should discuss the response to medication-related toxicity, taking intoPanel's Recommendations In children who have severe or life-threatening toxicity, all components of their drug regimen should be stopped immediately (AIII). Once symptoms of toxicity have resolved, antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be resumed with substitution of a different antiretroviral (ARV) drug or drugs for the offending agent(s) (AII*) . When modifying therapy because of toxicity or intolerance to a specific drug in children in whom virus has been suppressed, changing one drug in a multidrug regimen is permissible; if possible, an agent with a different toxicity and side-effect profile should be chosen (AI*). The toxicity and the medication presumed responsible should be documented in the medical record and the caregiver and patient advised of the drug-related toxicity to facilitate future medication choices if care is transferred (AIII). Dose reduction is not a recommended option in the setting of ARV toxicity, except when therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) indicates a drug concentration above the normal therapeutic range (AII*) . Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in childrenwith long-term outcomes; II* = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adults with long-term clinical outcomes with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = expert opinion Studies that include children or children and adolescents but not studies limited to postpubertal adolescentsaccount its severity, the relative need for viral suppression, and the available ARV options. In general, mild and moderate toxicities do not require discontinuation of therapy or drug substitution. However, even mild adverse effects may have a negative impact on medication adherence and should be discussed before therapy is initiated, at regular provider visits, and at onset of any adverse effects. Common, self-limited adverse effects should be anticipated. For example, when initiating therapy with boosted protease inhibitors (PIs) many patients experience gastrointestinal (GI) adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Instructing patients to take PIs with food may help minimize these side effects. Some patients may require antiemetics and antidiarrheal agents for symptom management. Central nervous system (CNS) adverse effects are commonly encountered when initiating therapy with efavirenz. Symptoms can include dizziness, drowsiness, vivid dreams, or insomnia. Patients should be instructed to take efavirenz- containing regimens at bedtime to help minimize these adverse effects and be advised that these side effects should diminish or disappear within 2 to 4 weeks of initiating therapy. In addition, mild rash can be treated with drugs such as antihistamines. For some moderate toxicities, using a drug in the same class as the one causing toxicity but with a different toxicity profile may be sufficient and discontinuation of all therapy may not be required. Severe, life-threatening toxicity requires discontinuation of all ARV drugs and the initiation of appropriate supportive therapy (depending on the type of toxicity). Once the patient is stable and toxicity has resolved, another drug can be substituted for the drug associated with the toxicity. In patients who experience an unacceptable adverse effect from ART, every attempt should be made to identify the offending agent and replace the drug with another effective agent as soon as possible.2, 3For example, if therapy needs to be stopped because of a severe or life-threatening side effect, all ARV drugs should be stopped at the same time. Once the offending drug or alternative cause for the adverse event has been determined, planning can begin for resumption of therapy with a new ARV regimen that does not contain the offending drug or with the original regimen, if the event is attributable to another cause. All drugs in the ARV regimen should then be started simultaneously, rather than one at a time with observation for adverse effects. Many experts recommend stopping efavirenz, etravirine, or nevirapine before stopping other drugs, if possible, because these drugs have significantly longer half-lives than nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (see Discontinuation or Interruption of Therapy section). However, in patients who have a severe or life-threatening toxicity, all components of the drug regimen should be stopped simultaneously, regardless of drug half-life. When therapy is changed because of toxicity or intolerance in the context of virologic suppression, agents with different toxicity and side-effect profiles should be chosen, when possible.4-8Clinicians should have comprehensive knowledge of the toxicity profile of each agent before selecting a new regimen. In the event of drug intolerance, changing a single drug in a multidrug regimen is a permissible for patients whose viral loads are undetectable. However, substitution of a single active agent for a single drug in a failing multidrug regimen is generally not recommended because of concern for development of resistance (see Approach to the Management of Antiretroviral Treatment Failure ). Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is not available on a routine basis to most clinicians, and the settings in which it is useful are unclear, especially in children. One such setting, however, may be in the context of the child with mild or moderate toxicity possibly attributable to a particular ARV agent (see Role of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring in Management of Treatment Failure ). In this situation, it is reasonable for a clinician to use TDM (if available) to determine if the toxicity is result of a drug concentration exceeding the normal therapeutic range.9, 10This is the only setting in which dose reduction would be considered appropriate management of drug toxicity, and even then, it should be used with caution. To summarize, management strategies for drug intolerance include: Symptomatic treatment of mild-to-moderate transient side effects. If necessary, change from one drug to another drug to which a patient's virus is sensitive (such as Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection K-2Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection K-3changing to abacavir for zidovudine-related anemia or to nevirapine for efavirenz-related CNS symptoms). Change drug class, if necessary (such as from a PI to a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or vice versa) and if a patient's virus is sensitive to a drug in that class. Dose reduction only when drug levels are determined excessive. Tables 17a-17l. Antiretroviral Therapy-Associated Adverse Effects and Management Recommendations describe specific adverse drug effects observed in children, including lactic acidosis, hepatic toxicity, renal toxicity, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, osteopenia, hematological adverse effects, adverse effects, peripheral neuropathy, hypersensitivity reactions, and skin rashes. The tables include information on common causative drugs, estimated frequency of occurrence, timing of symptoms, risk factors, potential preventive measures, and suggested clinical management strategies and provide selected references regarding these toxicities in pediatric patients.

For either RPG 200 mg/dL plus symptoms of DM or FPG 126 mg/dL: resistance, asymptomatic hyperglycemia, and DM form a spectrum of increasing severity. Insulin resistance is often defined as elevated insulin levels for the level of glucose observed; impaired FPG as an FPG of 100-125 mg/dL; impaired glucose tolerance as an elevated 2-hour PG of 140-199 mg/dL in a standard OGTT; and diabetes mellitusas either an FPG 126 mg/dL, a random PG 200 mg/dL in a patient with hyperglycemia symptoms, an HgbA1C of 6.5%, or a 2-hour PG after OGTT 200 mg/dL.

A careful assessment is required to evaluate the etiology of treatment failure and determine the appropriate management strategy. Not all instances of treatment failure require an immediate change in ART; in many cases, treatment efficacy can be restored by improving adherence or addressing other comorbidities. The approach to treatment failure in children and adolescents who have received more than one ARV regimen is often more complex than the approach in those receiving their first regimen. However, with the availability of an increasing number of antiretroviral (ARV) agents, including those directed at new viral targets, the goals of treatment for all patients\u2014whether on initial, second, or subsequent regimens\u2014remain the same: complete virologic suppression, combined with recovery or maintenance of immunologic function, and attainment or preservation of optimal clinical status, while preventing emergence of new viral drug-resistance mutations (see Assessment of Patients with Antiretroviral Treatment Failure and Management of Medication Toxicity or Intolerance ). Decisions regarding changing ART should be individualized and should take into consideration a child's treatment history, including any ARV-associated toxicities; current virologic, immunologic, and clinical status; and ability to adhere to a new regimen as well as prior and current detection of drug-resistant virus and available treatment options. Given these complexities, all children being evaluatedPanel's Recommendations The goal of therapy following treatment failure is to achieve and maintain virologic suppression, as measured by a plasma viral load below the limits of quantification using the most sensitive assay (AI*). When complete virologic suppression cannot be achieved, the goals of therapy are to preserve or restore immunologic function (as measured by CD4 lymphocyte values), prevent clinical disease progression, and prevent development of additional drug resistance that could further limit future antiretroviral options (AII). Not all instances of treatment failure require an immediate change in therapy; careful assessment, especially of adherence, is required to evaluate the etiology of the treatment failure and determine an appropriate management strategy(AII). Children who require evaluation for treatment failure should be managed in collaboration with a pediatric HIV specialist (AI*). Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in childrenwith long-term outcomes; II* = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adults with long-term clinical outcomes with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = expert opinion Studies that include children or children and adolescents but not studies limited to postpubertal adolescentsfor treatment failure should be managed in collaboration with a pediatric HIV specialist. Developmental and behavioral characteristics distinguish adolescents from adults and affect decisions concerning management of treatment failure (see Specific Issues in Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV-Infected Adolescents ). Drug metabolism may vary during puberty,6necessitating a reassessment of medication dosing throughout adolescence. In some instances, young adults may require larger doses by weight or by surface areathan older adults (such as atazanavir; see Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information ). In addition, dosing recommendations for adolescents have not been established for a number of new ARV medications nowused in adults. Dosing guidance for children and adolescents for all ARV agents can be found in Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information . The Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1- Infected Adults and Adolescents can provide additional information to help inform management of ARV treatment failure in adolescents. Definitions of Treatment Failure (see Table 18. Definitions of Treatment Failure in Human Immun - odeficiency Virus (HIV)-Infected Children ) Treatment failure can be categorized as virologic failure, immunologic failure, or clinical failure (or somecombination of the three). Laboratory results must be confirmed with repeat testing before a final assessment ofvirologic or immunologic treatment failure is made. Virologic Failure: Virologic failure occurs as an incomplete initial response to therapy or as a viral rebound after virologic suppression is achieved. Virologic suppression is defined as having plasma HIV RNA below the level of quantification using the most sensitive assay (<20-75 copies/mL). Older assays withlower limits of 200 or 400 copies/mL are acceptable if they are the only option; levels reported as detectablebut below the level of quantification should not be considered evidence of virologic failure. Incomplete virologic response to therapy: Incomplete virologic response to therapy is defined for all children as a <1.0 log 10decrease in HIV RNA copy number from baseline after 8 to 12 weeks of therapy, plasma HIV RNA >200 copies/mL after 6 months of therapy, or repeated plasma HIV RNA greater than the level of quantification using the most sensitive assay after 12 months of therapy.Occasionally, infants with high plasma HIV RNA levels at initiation of therapy have HIV RNA levelsthat are declining but remain >200 copies/mL after 6 months of therapy. Among many of thosereceiving lopinavir/ritonavir, suppression can be achieved without regimen change if efforts are madeto improve adherence. 7However, ongoing non-suppression\u2014especially with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptor inhibitor-based regimens\u2014increases risk of drug resistance.8HIV-infected adults with detectable HIV RNA and a quantified result <200 copies/mL after 6 months of combination ART(cART) often ultimately achieve virologic suppression without regimen change. 9 Viral rebound: For children whose plasma HIV RNA level was previously virologically suppressed in response to therapy, viral rebound is defined as subsequent, repeated detection of plasma HIV RNA above the level of quantification. \"Blips,\" defined as isolated episodes of plasma HIV RNA <1,000 copies/mL followed by return to viral suppression, are common and not generally reflective of virologic failure.10, 11Repeated or persistent plasma HIV RNA detection above the level of quantification (especially if >1,000 copies/mL) more likely represents viral rebound.12, 13 Immunologic Failure: Immunologic failure is defined as an incomplete immunologic response to therapy or an immunologic decline while on therapy. Evaluation of immune response in children is complicated by the normal age-related changes in CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4 cell) count discussed previously (see Immunologic Monitoring in Children ). Thus, the normal decline in CD4 values with age needs to be considered when evaluating declines in CD4 parameters. CD4 percentage tends to vary less with age. At about age 5 years, absolute CD4 count values in children approach those of adults; consequently, changes in absolute count can be used in children aged 5 years. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection L-2Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection L-3Incomplete immunologic response to therapy: Incomplete immunologic response to therapy is defined as the failure of CD4 percentage to increase by 5 percentage points in a child aged <5 years with severe immune suppression (CD4 percentage <15%) or as the failure of absolute CD4 cell countto increase by 50 cells/mm 3above baseline within the first year of therapy in a child 5 years of age with severe immune suppression (CD4 <200 cells/mm3). Immunologic decline: Immunologic decline is defined as a sustained decline to 5 CD4 percentage points below the pre-therapy baseline at any age or a decline in absolute CD4 cell count to belowpre-therapy baseline in children aged 5 years. Declines that represent a change to a more advancedcategory of immunosuppression compared with baseline (e.g., from CD4 percentage of 28% to 23%or from CD4 cell count of 250 cells/mm 3to 150 cells/mm3) or to more severe immunosuppression in children already suppressed at baseline (e.g., from CD4 percentage of 14% to 9% or from CD4 cellcount of 150 cells/mm 3to 100 cells/mm3) are of particular concern. Clinical Failure: Clinical failure is defined as the occurrence of new opportunistic infections (OIs) and/or other clinical evidence of HIV disease progression during therapy. Clinical failure represents the most urgentand concerning type of treatment failure and should prompt an immediate evaluation. Clinical findings shouldbe viewed in the context of virologic and immunologic response to therapy; in patients with stable virologicand immunologic parameters, development of clinical symptoms may not represent treatment failure. Clinicalevents occurring in the first several months after cART initiation often do not represent cART failure. Forexample, the development or worsening of an OI in a patient who recently initiated cART may reflect a degreeof persistent immune dysfunction in the context of early recovery, or, conversely be a result of immunereconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). However, the occurrence of significant clinical diseaseprogression, such as noted below, should prompt strong consideration that the current treatment regimen isfailing: Progressive neurodevelopmental deterioration. The presence of two or more of the following findings documented on repeated assessments: Impairment in brain growth (e.g., lack of expectedincrease in head circumference in infants and young children), decline in cognitive functiondocumented by psychometric testing, or clinical motor dysfunction. Growth failure. Persistent decline in weight-growth velocity despite adequate nutritional support and without other explanation. Severe or recurrent infection or illness. Recurrence or persistence of AIDS-defining conditions or other serious infections. Children who experience treatment failure do not always require an immediate change in therapy; carefulassessment is required to evaluate the etiology of the treatment failure and determine an appropriate management strategy (see Assessment of Patients with Antiretroviral Treatment Failure ). Discordance Between Viral, Immune, and Clinical Responses In general, cART that results in virologic suppression also leads to immune restoration or preservation as well as to prevention of HIV-related illnesses. The converse is also generally true: ineffective cART that fails to suppress viremia is commonly accompanied by immunologic and clinical failure.14However, patients may also present with failure in one domain (e.g., immunologic failure) but with a good response in the other domains (e.g., virologic and clinical response). In fact, the discordance in responses to cART can occur in any of these three domains in relation to the other two. It is essential to consider potential alternative causes of discordant responses before concluding that ART failure has truly occurred. Incomplete Virologic Response Despite Adequate Clinical and Immunologic Responses: Some patients who are maintained on cART may sustain immunologic and clinical benefit for up to 3 years despitepersistent viremia.15-24This observation is the rationale for continuing non-suppressive ART for immunologic and clinical benefit in selected patients for whom a completely suppressive regimen is not available or practical. The risks, benefits, and indications for this approach are discussed in Approach to the Management of Antiretroviral Treatment Failure and Choice of Next Antiretroviral Regimen for Treatment Failure with Evidence of Drug Resistance . The proposed mechanisms for immunologic and clinical benefit without complete virologic suppression are maintenance of a lower viral load or selection for strains harboring drug-resistance mutations that impair viral replication or virulence. Another potential explanation for thisdiscordance is that some of these children may have host genetic and/or virologic characteristics that wouldhave allowed them to be either \"slow-progressors\" or \"long-term non-progressors\" without therapy. Poor Immunologic Response Despite Virologic Suppression Regardless of Clinical Response: Poor immunologic response despite virologic suppression can occur in the context of adequate or poor clinicalresponse. The first considerations in cases of poor immunologic response despite virologic suppression are toexclude laboratory error in CD4 or viral load measurements and to ensure that CD4 values have beeninterpreted correctly in relation to the natural decline in CD4 count over the first 5 to 6 years of life. Anotherlaboratory consideration is that some viral load assays may not amplify all HIV groups and subtypes (such asHIV-1 non-M groups or non-B subtypes, HIV-2), resulting in falsely low or negative viral load results (seeDiagnosis of HIV Infection in Infants and Laboratory Monitoring of Pediatric HIV Infection ). Once lab results are confirmed, evaluation for adverse drug effects, medical conditions, and other factors that can result in lowerCD4 values is necessary. In addition, it is common for patients with baseline severe immunosuppression to achieve virologic suppression weeks to months before achieving immunologic recovery, resulting in a transient early treatment period ofpersistent immunosuppression during which additional clinical disease progression can occur. Patients whohave very low baseline CD4 values before initiating combination therapy are at higher risk of an impaired CD4lymphocyte response to cART and, based on adult studies, may be at higher risk of death and AIDS-definingillnesses, despite virologic suppression. 25-29 Certain ARV agents or combinations may be associated with a blunted CD4 response. For example, treatmentwith a regimen containing tenofovir and didanosine can blunt the CD4 response, especially if the didanosinedose is not reduced 30and this combination is not recommended as part of initial therapy. Dosing of didanosine should be adjusted when co-administered with tenofovir. In adults, ARV regimens containing zidovudine mayalso impair rise in CD4 cell count but not CD4 percentage, perhaps through the myelosuppressive effects ofzidovudine. 31Fortunately, this ARV drug-related suboptimal CD4 cell count response to therapy does not seem to confer an increased risk of clinical events. It is not clear whether this scenario warrants substitution ofzidovudine with another drug. Several drugs (e.g., corticosteroids, chemotherapeutic agents) and other conditions (e.g., hepatitis C, tuberculosis, malnutrition, Sjogren's syndrome, sarcoidosis, syphilis) are independently associated with low CD4 values. Occasional cases of idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia have also been reported in HIV-uninfected adults. 32 Differential Diagnosis of Poor Immunologic Response Despite Virologic Suppression: Poor Immunologic Response Despite Virologic Suppression and Good Clinical Response Lab error (in CD4 lymphocyte or viral load result) Normal age-related CD4 lymphocyte decline (i.e., immunologic response not actually poor) Low pretreatment CD4 cell count or percentage Adverse effects of use of zidovudine or the combination of tenofovir and didanosine Use of systemic corticosteroids or chemotherapeutic agents Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection L-4 Conditions that can cause low CD4 values, such as hepatitis C coinfection, tuberculosis, malnutrition, Sjogren's syndrome, sarcoidosis, and syphilis Poor Immunologic and Clinical Responses Despite Virologic Suppression Lab error, including HIV strain/type not detected by viral load assay (HIV-1 non-M groups, non-B subtypes; HIV-2) Persistent immunodeficiency soon initiation of ART but before ART-related reconstitution Primary protein-calorie malnutrition Untreated tuberculosis Malignancy Loss of immunologic (CD4) reserve Poor Clinical Response Despite Adequate Virologic and Immunologic Responses: Clinicians must carefully evaluate patients who experience clinical disease progression despite favorable immunological and virological responses to cART. Not all cases represent ART failure. One of the most important reasons for newor recurrent opportunistic conditions despite achieving virologic suppression and immunologicrestoration/preservation within the first months of cART is IRIS, which does not represent cART failure anddoes not generally require discontinuation of cART. 33, 34Children who have suffered irreversible damage to their lungs, brain, or other organs, especially during prolonged and profound pretreatment immunosuppression,may continue to have recurrent infections or symptoms in the damaged organs because the immunologicimprovement may not reverse damage to the organs. 35Such cases do not represent cART failure and, in these instances, children would not benefit from a change in ARV regimen. Before reaching a definitive conclusionof cART failure, a child should also be evaluated to rule out (and if indicated, treat) other causes or conditionsthat can occur with or without HIV-related immunosuppression, such as pulmonary tuberculosis, malnutrition,and malignancy. Occasionally, however, children will develop new HIV-related opportunistic conditions (suchas Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia or esophageal candidiasis occurring more than 6 months after achieving markedly improved CD4 values and virologic suppression) not explained by IRIS, pre-existing organ damage,or another reason. Although such cases are rare, they may represent cART failure and suggest thatimprovement in CD4 values may not necessarily represent the return of complete immunologic function. Differential Diagnosis of Poor Clinical Response Despite Adequate Virologic and Immunologic Responses: IRIS Previously unrecognized pre-existing infection or condition (tuberculosis, malignancy) Malnutrition Clinical manifestations of previous organ damage: brain (strokes, vasculopathy), lungs (bronchiectasis) New clinical event due to non-HIV illness or condition New, otherwise unexplained HIV-related clinical event (treatment failure) Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection L-5Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection L-6Table 18. Definitions of Treatment Failure in HIV-Infected Children Virologic Failurea Incomplete virologic response to therapy: response to therapy is defined as: <1.0 log10decrease in HIV RNA copy number from baseline after 8-12 weeks of therapy, or HIV RNA >200 copies/mL after 6 months of therapy, or repeated HIV RNA above the level of quantification using the most sensitive assay after 12 months of therapy.a Viral rebound: Viral rebound is defined as repeated detection of plasma HIV RNA above the level of quantification after a child had achieved virologic suppression in response to therapy. Isolated episodes of plasma HIV RNA detection above the level of quantification but <1,000 copies/mL arecommon. They generally do not indicate virologic failure and may be transient blips, but should befollowed up to confirm spontaneous resolution. ImmunologicFailure b Incomplete immunologic response to therapy: Failure in a child aged <5 years with severe immune suppression (CD4 percentage <15%) of CD4 percentage to increase by 5 percentage points or failure in a child aged 5 years with severe immune suppression (CD4 < 200 cells/mm3) of absolute CD4 cell counts to increase by 50 cells/mm3above baseline within the first year of therapy. Immunologic decline: Sustained decline of 5 percentage points in CD4 percentage below pre- therapy baseline at any age or decline to below pre-therapy baseline in absolute CD4 cell count inchildren aged 5 years. c Clinical Failure Progressive neurodevelopmental deterioration: Two or more of the following on repeated assessments: impairment in brain growth, decline in cognitive function documented bypsychometric testing, and clinical motor dysfunction. Growth failure: Persistent decline in weight-growth velocity despite adequate nutritional support and without other explanation. Severe or recurrent infection or illness: Recurrence or persistence of AIDS-defining conditions or other serious infections. aChildren with higher plasma HIV RNA levels at initiation of therapy, especially infants, may take longer to reach undetectableviral load. 7HIV-infected adults with HIV RNA detectable above the level of quantification but <200 copies/mL after 6 months of cART often ultimately achieve virologic suppression without regimen change.9 bAt least 2 measurements (taken at least 1 week apart) should be performed to confirm initial laboratory results. cDeclines that represent a change to a more advanced category of immunosuppression compared with baseline (such as from CD4 percentage of 28% to 23% or from CD4 cell count of 250 cells/mm3to 150 cells/mm3) or to more severe immunosuppression in those already suppressed at baseline (such as from CD4 percentage of 14% to 9% or from CD4 cellcount of 150 cells/mm 3to 100 cells/mm3) are of particular concern.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection L-9Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection L-10Assessment of Patients with Virologic Failure of Antiretroviral Treatment (Last updated November 1, 2012; last reviewed November 1, 2012) Each patient with an incomplete virologic response to therapy should be assessed to determine the cause of treatment failure because the approach to management and subsequent treatment may differ depending on theetiology of the problem. In most instances, treatment failure is multifactorial. Assessment of a child withsuspicion of virologic treatment failure should include evaluation of adherence to therapy, medicationintolerance, issues related to pharmacokinetics (PK) that could result in low drug levels or elevated,potentially toxic levels, and evaluation of suspected drug resistance. The main barrier to long-termmaintenance of undetectable plasma viral load in adults and children is incomplete adherence to medicationregimens, with subsequent emergence of viral mutations conferring partial or complete resistance to one or more of the components of the antiretroviral (ARV) regimen. Table 19 outlines a comprehensive approach to evaluating causes of virologic treatment failure in children, with particular attention to adherence. An extensive history should focus on the details of drug administration as well as changes in the social and psychological circumstances of the family likely to impact the child's ability to adhere to therapy. In some situations, it may be necessary to directly observe drug-taking behaviors either in the clinic, at home, or in the hospital because history alone may not fully identify the barriers to complete adherence. 1, 2 Adherence Problems (For more details, see Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV-Infected Chil - dren and Adolescents and Table 11 .) When treatment failure is observed, clinicians need to assess the likely contribution of adherence problems to the failure of the current regimen. In patients on initial therapy, poor virologic response or widely fluctuatingPanel's Recommendations Assess adherence to therapy; address barriers and develop interventions to improve adherence (AII). Assess medication intolerance (AIII). Assess issues related to pharmacokinetics because developmental and individual differences in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination can cause inadequate antiretroviral (ARV) drug exposure that can result in combination antiretroviral therapy failure (AII). Perform ARV drug-resistance testing when virologic failure occurs, while a patient is still taking the failing regimen and before changing to a new regimen (AI*). Perform assessment in collaboration with a pediatric HIV specialist (AI*). Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in childrenwith long-term outcomes; II* = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adults with long-term clinical outcomes with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = expert opinion Studies that include children or children and adolescents but not studies limited to postpubertal adolescentsviral loads\u2014particularly in the presence of susceptible virus\u2014are commonly an indication of poor adherence. Depending on the specific drug regimen, even small lapses in adherence can lead to cARTfailure. 3-8Although adherence should be addressed at each medical visit for all children receiving cART, suspicion of treatment failure warrants increased scrutiny of adherence. Patterns of adherence can changeover time and may be influenced by a large number of factors inherent to the drugs as well as social andpsychological issues of children and their families. It is important to evaluate whether adherence problems are related to drug formulation, number of pills, drugdose timing and frequency, food or fasting requirements, or drug side effects in order to determine changes bestsuited to the individual requirements of a child and his or her family. Family education concerning adherenceshould be intensive and include training in the administration of prescribed medications with emphasis on theimportance of adherence to the drug regimen. Familial or social issues that impede adherence may need to beaddressed before adherence can be improved. Issues to be addressed include financial or housing insecurity,concomitant mental health problems, need for substance abuse treatment, and fear of HIV disclosure. In somesituations, clinicians may need to involve outside agencies, such as child protective services, to ensure supportof a child's treatment. Various interventions should be considered if problems within the household are extremeand unlikely to resolve in favor of successfully supporting a child's treatment. Frequent patient visits andintensive follow-up may be necessary to support new adherence interventions and efforts by the child and thefamily to improve adherence to the current or new regimen. Directly observed therapy (DOT) may be used toidentify additional factors impeding adherence as well as to confirm drug administration; however, durabilityof adherence improvement is variable after DOT is discontinued. 9 Pharmacokinetic Factors Treatment failure can result from inadequate drug exposure as well as poor adherence.10Children consistently require higher weight-based dosing of ARV drugs than do adults because of developmental differences inabsorption, body composition, and metabolic activity through the pediatric age range. 11Causes of subtherapeutic drug levels may include failure to increase dosing to accommodate for a child's rapid growth or impairedabsorption because of gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting or diarrhea. Because drug exposure can beenhanced or reduced by administering medications with food, a clinician should review the food/fastingrequirements of a regimen with both patient and caregiver. Drug interactions can alter drug metabolism;therefore, all concomitant medications, including over-the-counter medications and nutritional and herbalsupplements, should be reviewed to evaluate whether they may be contributing to poor treatment response (seethe Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents ). Several studies suggest that genetic polymorphisms may influence PK and therapeutic response for a number of antiretroviral(ARV) medications. 12-14In some circumstances, therapeutic drug monitoring can be considered for children receiving selected drugs (see Role of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring in Management of Treatment Failure ). Suspected Drug Resistance (See Antiretroviral Drug-Resistance Testing ) ARV drug resistance may develop in children who are taking ARV drugs in the context of inadequate viral suppression. Genotypic resistance testing can help assess adherence to therapy. If testing reveals no resistance-associated mutations to the drugs in the current regimen, it is unlikely that the child is currently taking these medications. The presence of mutations that confer resistance to one or more drugs in the regimen is consistent with patient adherence (partial or full) to the regimen at that time, but failure of the regimen to adequately suppress viral replication because of drug resistance. Because virus variants harboring resistance mutations may decrease in frequency to below the limits of detection of standard resistance assays in the absence of the selective pressure of ARV drugs, ARV resistance testing should be performed while a patient is still taking the failing regimen or within 4 weeks of discontinuing the regimen. Resistance testing can be used to assess reasons for current virologic failure and to identify active ARV medications for future regimens. (See Antiretroviral Drug-Resistance Testing .)

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection L-14Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection L-15Approach to the Management of Virologic Failure of Antiretroviral Treatment (Last updated November 1, 2012; last reviewed November 1, 2012) General Note: This section will focus only on the management of virologic treatment failure. For patients with immunologic failure or clinical failure in the setting of virologic suppression, non-HIV-related causes of immunologic or clinical failure should be identified and addressed, though frequently no specific etiology isidentified. There is no consensus about the best management of immunologic or clinical failure in the settingof sustained virologic suppression. Once the potential causes of virologic treatment failure have been identified and addressed, the child should be assessed to determine whether a change in antiretroviral (ARV) drug regimen is necessary and advisable.This will depend on the urgency and likelihood of achieving and sustaining an undetectable plasma viralload. The urgency of implementing a more effective treatment regimen depends on a child's immunologicstatus, with the greatest urgency in patients with clinical disease progression or clinical failure. The likelihood of achieving and maintaining undetectable plasma viral load depends on the extent of drug resistance, the number and quality of available agents that are active against a child's virus, and the likelihood of adherence to the new regimen. If poor adherence has been a major contributor to virologic treatment failure, and factors contributing to poor adherence have not been adequately addressed, changing the ARV drug regimen may not be advisable because it is not likely to result in virologic suppression and is likely to promote accumulation of additional drug resistance mutations. Timing of Initiation of a New Regimen: Relative Importance of Virologic Suppression and Immunologic Improvement Because immunologic improvement typically results from achieving undetectable plasma viral load,1the urgency of re-establishing virologic suppression depends on a child's clinical and immunologic status. For example, for older children or adolescents with severe immunosuppression (such as CD4 T lymphocyte [CD4 cell] counts <200 cells/mm3), a change in therapy may be critical to prevent further immunologicPanel's Recommendations The causes of virologic treatment failure, which include poor adherence, drug resistance, poor absorption of medications, inadequate dosing, and drug-drug interactions, should be assessed and addressed (AII). When deciding how to treat a child with virologic treatment failure, the probability of achieving durable virologic suppression should be considered, as well as the future options for treatment, should durable suppression not be achieved (AII). Children who experience treatment failure should be managed in collaboration with a pediatric HIV specialist (AI*). Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in childrenwith long-term outcomes; II* = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adults with long-term clinical outcomes with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = expert opinion Studies that include children or children and adolescents but not studies limited to postpubertal adolescentsdecline or clinical disease progression and is strongly recommended. A patient with less immunosuppression is likely at less risk of clinical disease progression in the short term, so an immediate change in therapy isless urgent. However, continued treatment of a child with persistently detectable viremia increases the risk ofimmunologic decline or clinical disease progression and leads to further accumulation of resistancemutations, possibly further limiting future treatment options. 2, 3Finally, even in children with advanced clinical and/or immunologic status, initiating a new regimen in the face of persistent adherence difficulties isunlikely to result in virologic suppression, and it is likely to promote accumulation of additional resistance. Likelihood of Viral Suppression Below the Limit of Detection Using the Most Sensitive Assay When deciding whether to change a child's ARV drug regimen, a clinician must assess the likelihood that the new regimen will achieve significantly better virologic control than the current regimen. Although completevirologic suppression should be the goal, this may not always be achievable in HIV-infected children andadolescents. Clinical benefit may be observed with decrements in HIV RNA levels that do not result inundetectable levels. 1However, failure to maximally suppress plasma viral load is associated with an increased probability of acquiring mutations associated with resistance.4It is important that the clinician alert the patient to potential toxicities and discuss strategies to minimize their impact. The likelihood of adherenceto a new regimen plays a significant role in determining whether to change an ARV regimen; if a child isunlikely to adhere to a new regimen, resistance will develop and sustainable virologic suppression will not beachieved. Although studies differ on the exact predictors of adherence, several contributing factors have beennoted. These include medication characteristics, 5psychosocial stressors,6, 7health beliefs,8and prior adherence to medication (see Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV-Infected Children and Adolescents for more detail). Importantly, adherence to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) may change rapidlyand unexpectedly with a change in family circumstances or as a child moves through progressivedevelopmental stages. Thus, a clinician may choose to target a new ARV regimen to start at a time when achild and his or her family are most likely to adhere to the new regimen for a sustained period. Categories of Children with Treatment Failure and Approaches to Consider No Viral Drug Resistance Identified Persistent viremia in the absence of detectable viral resistance to current medications suggests that the virusis not being exposed to the ARV agents. This lack of ARV drug exposure is usually a result of nonadherence,but it is important to exclude other factors such as poor drug absorption, incorrect dosing, and druginteractions. If adequate drug exposure can be ensured, then adherence to the current regimen should result inundetectable plasma levels. Resistance testing should take place while a child is on therapy. Afterdiscontinuation of therapy, predominant plasma viral strains may quickly revert to wild-type and re-emerge as the predominant viral population, in which case resistance testing may fail to reveal drug-resistant virus (see Antiretroviral Drug-Resistance Testing ). Thus, if a child on cART develops resistant virus and then stops therapy, sensitive virus will dominate in the absence of therapy. In this situation, resuming the prior therapy would fail to suppress the virus because the resistant virus would again emerge. An approach to identifying resistance in this situation is to restart the prior medications while emphasizing adherence and repeat resistance testing in 4 weeks if plasma virus remains detectable. If plasma virus is undetectable with the most sensitive assays, the virus is likely to be susceptible to the current therapy. Viral Resistance to Current Antiretroviral Therapy The recommendation in this situation is to start a new cART regimen in order to fully suppress and sustain plasma viral load below the limits of detection and prevent emergence of virus with additional resistance mutations. This requires a regimen that includes at least two, and preferably three, fully active agents. The choice of new agents should be based on current and past resistance testing (see Antiretroviral Drug - Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection L-16Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection L-17Resistance Testing ), ART history, availability of new drugs and classes of agents, and consideration of potential toxicities. Some ARV drugs (such as nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NRTIs]) may contribute partial ARV activity to an ARV regimen, despite drug resistance. Because of the potential for crossresistance of some drugs within a single class, substituting a new drug from the same previously used classdoes not ensure that the replacement drug will be fully active. This is particularly true for the non-nucleosidereverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) nevirapine and efavirenz, for which cross-resistance with drugmutations is uniformly seen. The availability of an increasing number of ARV drugs, including some with new viral targets, makes complete virologic suppression achievable for many patients with treatment failure. Unfortunately, the lackof pediatric formulations and dosing information for some of these agents limits the number of optionsavailable for younger children. Thus, it remains difficult to identify a new, active regimen for many childrenwith extensive prior therapy (see The Use of Antiretroviral Agents Not Approved for Use in Children ). If difficulties contributing to poor adherence with the current regimen are likely to continue, emphasis andeffort should be placed on improving adherence before initiating a new regimen (see next section). Extensive Viral Drug Resistance Such That Two Fully Active Agents Cannot be Identified or Administered In children for whom undetectable plasma virus is not achievable because two or more fully active agents cannot be identified, the goal is to preserve immunologic function and prevent clinical disease progressionwhile preserving future options for new agents that are not yet available. Adult cohort studies suggest thatmaintaining HIV viral load at <10,000 to 20,000 copies/mL may offer ongoing immunologic and clinicalbenefit; 9, 10pediatric studies suggest that children receiving cART with viral load <1,000 to 5,000 copies/mL may not achieve significantly better clinical and immunologic outcomes by changing therapy.3, 4, 11Several cohort studies show a clinical benefit of remaining on cART, regardless of whether it leads to a decrease inviral load. The principal risk associated with continuing a failing regimen when no suppressive regimen isavailable is the development of additional resistance mutations that can limit future treatment options. Thisrisk is especially true for NNRTI-containing regimens but also occurs with prolonged use of non-suppressiveprotease inhibitor-containing regimens. 2, 4, 12 The goal of continued treatment with an incompletely suppressive regimen is to select for resistant virus withreduced viral fitness that will cause slower disease progression while minimizing risk of drug toxicity anddevelopment of new resistance mutations to multiple classes of drugs. Simplified (often all-NRTI) \"holdingregimens\" are sometimes used in place of continuing a failing cART regimen (see Choice of Therapy When Two Agents Cannot be Identified ). The overall goal of these alternative strategies is to prevent clinical and immunological progression until additional active drugs are available that can be used to design a regimen that is expected to achieve undetectable plasma viral load.1, 13-21This approach should be regarded as acceptable but not ideal; these patients should be followed more closely than those with stable virologic status and the potential for successful initiation of a fully suppressive ARV drug regimen should be reassessed at every opportunity. Interrupting therapy completely will avoid new drug resistance, but potentially at higher risk of immunologic or clinical progression (see Treatment Interruption ). When managing disease progression in patients with advanced disease and extensive resistance, quality of life must be considered. The relative benefits (e.g., reduced viral fitness, continued clinical benefit despite resistance) and burdens of continuing a failing ARV drug regimen should be discussed. Decisions to continue, discontinue, or simplify cART should be made collaboratively with patients, families, and clinicians and should be consistent with the patients' or families' stated values and goals for care.Children with Ongoing Adherence Problems as a Major Reason for Virologic Treatment Failure If there is evidence of poor adherence to the current regimen and an assessment that good adherence to a new regimen is unlikely, emphasis and effort should be placed on improving adherence before initiating a newregimen (see Adherence ). Adherence in infants and younger children depends completely on their caregivers. When other intensive measures to address adherence problems have failed and caretakers appear unable orunwilling to administer medications, child protective services may need to be requested to assess the need foradditional support for current caretakers or for a change in caretaker. When efforts to improve adherence willrequire several weeks or months, some clinicians may choose to continue the current non-suppressiveregimen or use a simplified, NRTI-only, non-suppressive regimen that may provide some clinical andimmunologic benefit while preserving future ARV drug choices (see Choice of Therapy with Extensive Drug Resistance Such That Two Fully Active Agents Cannot Be Identified or Administered ).13, 22, 23Treatment with non-suppressive regimens in such situations should be regarded as an acceptable but not ideal interimstrategy to prevent immunologic and clinical deterioration while working on adherence. Such patients shouldbe followed more closely than those with stable virologic status, and the potential to successfully initiate afully suppressive ARV drug regimen should be reassessed at every opportunity. Complete treatment interruption for a persistently nonadherent patient should prevent accumulation of additional drug resistance but has been associated with immunologic declines and poor clinical outcomes. 24 However, the strategy of complete treatment interruption has not been fully evaluated in children. Althoughcomplete treatment interruption is not recommended for cases of ongoing poor adherence, it is recognizedthat some patients may decide on their own to stop all medications. Although careful monitoring and opencommunication between provider and patient are always important, they are especially critical in thesesituations (see Treatment Interruption ). References 1.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection L-20Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection L-21Choice of Next Antiretroviral Regimen for Virologic Treatment Failure with Evidence of Drug Resistance (Last updated November 1, 2012; last reviewed November 1, 2012) General After reaching a decision that a change in therapy is needed, a clinician should attempt to identify at least two, but preferably three, fully active antiretroviral (ARV) agents from at least two different classes on the basis ofresistance test results, prior ARV exposure, acceptability to the patient, and likelihood of adherence. 1-5This often requires using agents from one or more drug classes that are new to the patient. Substitution or additionof a single drug to a failing regimen should not be done because it is unlikely to lead to durable virologicsuppression and will likely result in additional drug resistance. A drug may be new to the patient but havediminished antiviral potency because of the presence of drug-resistance mutations that confer cross resistancewithin a drug class. In children who are changing therapy owing to the occurrence or progression of abnormal neurodevelopment, the new treatment regimen should include agents (such as zidovudine) that are known to achieve higher concentrations in the central nervous system. 6-10 A change to a new regimen must include an extensive discussion of treatment adherence and potential toxicity with a patient in an age- and development-appropriate manner and with a patient's caregivers. Clinicians must recognize that conflicting requirements of some medications with respect to food and concomitant medication restrictions may complicate administration of a regimen. Timing of medication administration is particularly important to ensure adequate ARV drug exposures throughout the day. Palatability, size and number of pills, and dosing frequency all need to be considered when choosing a new regimen.11 Choice of Therapy with Viral Resistance to Current Therapy: Goal of Complete Virologic Suppression Determination of a new regimen with the best chance for complete virologic suppression in children whoPanel's Recommendations Antiretroviral (ARV) regimens should be chosen based on treatment history and drug-resistance testing, including both past and current resistance test results (AI*). The new regimen should include at least two, but preferably three, fully active ARV medications with assessment of anticipated ARV activity based on past treatment history and resistance test results (AII*). Interpretation of resistance test results showing complex combinations of mutations and assessment of future treatment options should be made in collaboration with a pediatric HIV specialist (AI*). Use of novel agents with limited available pharmacokinetic and/or safety data in pediatric populations should be undertaken only in collaboration with a pediatric HIV specialist (AIII). Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in childrenwith long-term outcomes; II* = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adults with long-term clinical outcomes with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = expert opinion Studies that include children or children and adolescents but not studies limited to postpubertal adolescentshave already experienced treatment failure should be made in collaboration with a pediatric HIV specialist. ARV regimens should be chosen based on treatment history and drug-resistance testing to optimize ARVdrug potency in the new regimen. A general strategy for regimen change is shown in Table 20 , although as additional agents are licensed and studied for use in children, newer strategies that are better tailored to theneeds of each patient may be constructed. If a child has received initial therapy with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimen, a change to a protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimen is recommended. Resistance to the NNRTInevirapine results in cross-resistance to the NNRTI efavirenz, and vice versa. However, the newer NNRTIetravirine retains activity against nevirapine- or efavirenz-resistant virus (see below). If a child receivedinitial therapy with a PI-based regimen, a change to an NNRTI-based regimen is generally recommended.Lopinavir/ritonavir-based regimens have also been shown to have durable ARV activity in some PI-experienced children. 12-14Choice of the new dual-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) component is particularly important when constructing a regimen because the choice of an insufficientlypotent NRTI may result in selection of additional NRTI-related drug-resistance mutations. Resistance testingis essential to properly select a potent NRTI combination, and interpretation of these results should take placein collaboration with an expert in pediatric HIV infection (see Antiretroviral Drug-Resistance Testing ). The availability of new drugs in existing classes (e.g., the NNRTI etravirine) and new classes of drugs (e.g.,integrase inhibitors) increases the likelihood of finding three active drugs, even for children with extensivedrug resistance (Table 20 ). In studies of adults, etravirine retains activity against nevirapine- or efavirenz- resistant viruses when used in a regimen that also contains darunavir/ritonavir and if the number of NNRTIresistance-associated mutations is limited. 15, 16Etravirine in combination with ritonavir-boosted darunavir, as part of a new combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) regimen, has been shown to be a safe and effectiveoption for children in whom cART fails. 17, 18Etravirine is approved for use in children aged 6 years;17, 19 studies in younger children are under way. Studies of treatment-experienced adult and adolescent patientshave shown that using one or more new class(es) of drug (e.g., integrase inhibitors, entry inhibitors), oftencoupled with a ritonavir-boosted PI (e.g., darunavir) in PI-experienced patients with multidrug-resistantvirus, is associated with good virologic responses. 20-23Raltegravir, in combination with optimized background therapy, was safe and effective in treatment-experienced children aged 2 to 16 years,24for whom it is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved. Use of newer agents in novel combinations isbecoming more common in aging perinatally infected youth in the United States. 25It is important to review individual drug profiles for information about drug interactions and dose adjustment when devising aregimen for children with multi-class drug resistance. Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information provides more detailed information on drug formulation, pediatric and adult dosing, and toxicity, as well asdiscussion of available pediatric data for the approved ARV drugs, including new drugs in existing classessuch as darunavir and agents in new classes of drugs such as CCR5 antagonists (e.g., maraviroc, approved for use in adolescents aged 16 years) and integrase inhibitors (e.g., raltegravir, approved for use in children aged 2 years [FDA, December 21, 2011]). Previously prescribed drugs that were discontinued because of poor tolerance or poor adherence may sometimes be reintroduced if ARV resistance did not develop and if prior difficulties with tolerance and adherence can be overcome (such as by switching from a liquid to pill formulation or to a new formulation [such as ritonavir tablet]). Limited data in adults suggest that continuation of lamivudine can contribute to suppression of HIV replication despite the presence of lamivudine resistance mutations and can maintain lamivudine mutations (184V) that can partially reverse the effect of other mutations conferring resistance to zidovudine, stavudine, and tenofovir.26-28The use of new drugs that have been evaluated in adults but have not been fully evaluated in children may be justified and ideally is done in the framework of a clinical trial (see The Use of Antiretroviral Agents Not Approved for Use in Children ). Expanded access programs or clinical trials may be available. New drugs should be used in combination with at least one, and ideally two, additional active agents. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection L-22Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection L-23The HIV entry inhibitor enfuvirtide is approved for use in heavily treatment-experienced patients based on potent ARV activity in heavily treatment-experienced adults; it has been approved for use in children aged 6years. 29, 30Studies have helped establish safety, appropriate dosing, and efficacy of enfuvirtide in treatment- experienced children aged 6 years.31, 32Enfuvirtide must be administered by subcutaneous injection twice daily, a disadvantage that presents a greater challenge to adherence in adolescents than in younger children.Enfuvirtide can be considered an option when designing a new regimen for children in whom multiple classes ofARV medications have failed, but newer and better tolerated agents have largely supplanted use of enfuvirtide. Pharmacokinetic (PK) andlopinavir/ritonavir with atazanavir/ritonavir) suggest that PK targets for both PIs can be achieved or exceededwhen used in combination in adults 33-35and in children.36-38PK studies of other dual-boosted PI combinations are limited but suggest inadequate drug levels of one or both PIs.39, 40A study in Thailand of 50 PI-naive but NRTI +/- NNRTI-experienced children treated with a lopinavir/ritonavir (230/57.5 mg/m2twice daily) and saquinavir (50 mg/kg twice daily, maximum dose 1000 mg) demonstrated trough levels of both PIsat or above therapeutic targets and complete viral suppression at 48 weeks in 50% of patients. The use ofmultidrug regimens, sometimes including up to 3 PIs and/or 2 NNRTIs, has shown efficacy in a pediatric caseseries; 41however, multidrug regimens should be used cautiously because of their complexity, poor tolerability, and unfavorable drug-drug interactions. Therapeutic drug monitoring may be helpful for confirming therapeuticPI levels when using PIs in combinations that result in complex drug interactions or when there is partiallyreduced PI activity because of the presence of drug-resistance mutations (see Role of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring in Management of Treatment Failure ). Availability of newer potent PIs and new classes of ARV drugs (integrase and CCR5 inhibitors) may lessen the need for dual-PI regimens. When searching for at least two fully active agents in cases of extensive drug resistance, clinicians shouldconsider the potential availability and future use of newer therapeutic agents that may not be studied orapproved in children or may be in clinical development (see The Use of Antiretroviral Agents Not Approved for Use in Children ). Information concerning potential clinical trials can be found at http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/clinical-trials and through collaboration with a pediatric HIV specialist. Children should be enrolled in clinical trials of new drugs whenever possible. Therapeutic Options When Two Fully Active Agents Cannot Be Identified or Administered It may be impossible to provide an effective and sustainable therapeutic regimen because no combination of currently available agents is active against extensive drug-resistant virus in a patient or because a patient isunable to adhere to or tolerate cART. In such cases, non-suppressive regimens (or holding regimens) are sometimes used pending availability of additional active, tolerable drugs or improvement in ability to adhere. This interim strategy allows for the overall objective of preventing clinical and immunological deterioration until new agents are available to design a regimen that can be expected to achieve undetectable plasma viral load. This approach should be regarded as acceptable but not ideal. Such patients should be followed more closely than those with stable virologic status, and the potential to successfully initiate a fully suppressive cART regimen should be reassessed at every opportunity.Even when NRTI drug-resistance mutations are present, patients can derive immunologic and clinical benefit despite persistent viremia from treatment with lamivudine monotherapy or with lamivudine or emtricitabine in combination with one or more other NRTIs, such as zidovudine, stavudine, abacavir, or tenofovir. 42, 43 The newer NNRTI etravirine retains activity against many nevirapine- or efavirenz-resistant viruses with a limited number of NNRTI resistance-associated mutations. Ongoing use of efavirenz or nevirapine as part of a failing regimen should be avoided because it may lead to accumulation of additional NNRTI resistancemutations that will reduce etravirine activity and preclude its use in a future, suppressive regimen,44and it may allow for accumulation of additional NRTI resistance.45 Continued use of a PI in the face of persistent viremia can lead to accumulation of additional mutations conferring resistance to that PI as well as other, newer PIs. Such acquisition of additional PI drug resistanceoccurs slowly, especially if the viral load is relatively low. 46-49However, continued PI use in the presence of resistance may limit viral replication and be beneficial to some patients. When clinical or immunologic deterioration occurs while patients are receiving such holding regimens, it is important to re-assess patient readiness and regimen availability. It may be appropriate to use investigationalagents or agents approved for older age groups as second fully active drugs in the new regimen (see The Use of Antiretroviral Agents Not Approved for Use in Children ). In general, a single, new, fully active agent should not be added to non-suppressive holding regimens because resistance is likely to develop quickly. Table 20.

This is particularly important in selecting NRTI components of an NNRTI-based regimen where drug resistance to the NNRTIcan occur rapidly if the virus is not sufficiently sensitive to the NRTIs. Regimens should contain at least two, but preferablythree, fully active drugs for durable, potent virologic suppression. Please see individual drug profiles for information about drug interactions and dose adjustment when devising a regimen for children with multi-class drug resistance. Collaboration with a pediatric HIV specialist is especially important when choosing regimens for children with multi-class drug resistance.Regimens in this table are listed in relative order of preference and are provided as examples but the list is not exhaustive. bCaution advised when using raltegravir in children aged 6 years because pharmacokinetic and efficacy data are particularly limited in this age group. cNo current FDA-approved pediatric indication for maraviroc.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection L-28Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection L-29The Use of Antiretroviral Agents Not Approved for Use In Children (Last updated November 1, 2012; last reviewed November 1, 2012) It has long been the practice of physicians, especially pediatricians, to prescribe medications in off-label situations, meaning for indications or populations that do not fall within the official, Food and DrugAdministration (FDA)-approved indication. 1The relatively small market for pediatric antiretroviral (ARV) drugs and few children available to participate in clinical trials have delayed or prevented studies to obtain anFDA pediatric label indication for some ARV drugs at the same time their use in adults is approved. PediatricHIV specialists may need to prescribe these agents because drugs currently available for pediatric use affordfew options for heavily treated children and adolescents with high levels of resistance and because the neweragents offer improvements in tolerability and ease of adherence with less frequent dosing. One distinct advantage of some of the newer medications is improved tolerability. Examples include a reduction in frequency or severity of side effects with newer protease inhibitors (PIs) and the ability to create simpler regimens using fixed-dose combination tablets or once-daily preparations. The incentive to use these drugs to avoid toxicities and simplify regimens is that these regimens will lead to improved adherence, and thus, better long-term outcomes.Another major factor leading to off-label use of ARVs has been the development of new drugs belonging to novel classes of agents effective against resistant virus. In the United States, many older perinatally infected children have extensive drug resistance resulting from treatment with multiple non-suppressive regimens. Cross resistance between fully approved ARVs within a class makes it difficult to find a combination of agents likely to fully suppress the virus. In an effort to create a regimen likely to achieve complete virologic suppression in an individual patient, providers must identify at least two and preferably three drugs with demonstrated activity against the patient's virus. Success is almost impossible in heavily treatment- experienced children using only drugs with approved pediatric label indications; thus providers may usePanel's Recommendations Children may need to use antiretroviral (ARV) drugs that are not yet approved for their age because many of the recently approved, more convenient, and potent agents are approved for use in adults before pharmacokinetic (PK), safety, and efficacy data are available in children (AII). Dosing in a child of ARVs only approved for adults cannot simply be inferred from a simple calculation using the adult dose and the child's weight (AII). Such use of ARVs should always be done in collaboration with a pediatric HIV specialist, who may have access to unpublished data about safety and PKs of ARVs that are not yet Food and DrugAdministration (FDA)-approved for children (AI*). Whenever possible, use of ARVs that are not yet FDA-approved for children should be done in the context of clinical trials that can generate the data needed for pediatric approval (AIII). Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in childrenwith long-term outcomes; II* = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adults with long-term clinical outcomes with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = expert opinion Studies that include children or children and adolescents but not studies limited to postpubertal adolescentsdrugs not yet approved for children in order to provide optimal virologic response. The use of agents not yet approved for pediatric use causes some difficulties. One of the major issues is lack of data on appropriate dosing in children. Agents are approved for adult use before being approved forpediatric use because safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in children have not yet been completed.Sometimes studies in children are ongoing and some data are available, but other times, pediatric studieshave not yet begun. It is essential for providers prescribing agents for off-label use to consult with pediatricHIV experts to avail themselves of the latest information from ongoing studies. The possibility of age-related side effects is another concern when initiating off-label ARV use. To date, no ARV has been found to have adverse effects that preclude use uniquely in children, but until an agent hasbeen tested in children, it cannot be considered to be free of such an effect. In addition, adverse effects notedin adults may be of more substantial concern in a growing and developing child. Difficulties in pediatric dosing for off-label use of ARV drugs are even more problematic than the potential for adverse effects. As absorption, hepatic metabolism, and excretion change with age, so will drug levelschange in children. 2The difficulty in dosing children as they increase in weight is exacerbated by changing PKs. In clinical trials of several ARV agents, direct extrapolation of a pediatric dose from an adult dose,based on a child's body weight or body surface area, was shown to result in an underestimation of theappropriate pediatric dose. 3 In summary, use of ARV agents without a pediatric indication is an absolute necessity for treatment of someHIV-infected children, but such off-label use must be done with care. It is essential that a provider consultwith a pediatric HIV specialist to identify any particular concerns with each agent, to access anyavailable data from clinical trials or other limited off-label pediatric use, and to investigate theavailability of suitable clinical trials.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection L-30Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection L-31Role of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring in Management of Treatment Failure (Last updated August 11, 2011; last reviewed November 1, 2012) Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is use of plasma drug concentration measurements as part of a strategy to optimize drug dosing to minimize toxicity and maximize treatment benefit. TDM can be considered for use incombination antiretroviral therapy because: 1, 2 Interpatient variability in antiretroviral (ARV) exposure (i.e., plasma drug concentrations) using standard recommended doses is high; Low drug exposure can lead to suboptimal virologic response to therapy; and High plasma concentrations can be associated with increased risk of drug toxicity. Developmental pharmacokinetic differences contribute to greater variability and a greater frequency of suboptimal ARV exposure in pediatric patients than in adults.3Pediatric dosing is designed to mimic adult exposure and rarely reflects the maximum tolerated ARV drug dose. Even when using dose recommendationsfrom published pediatric guidelines, children often receive inadequate ARV doses. 4 There are two main situations in which TDM may be useful in a child who is failing therapy. First, TDM can beused to rule out subtherapeutic drug levels as a cause of failure. Such inadequate drug levels could result frommalabsorption, drug interactions, poor adherence, or increased drug metabolism or clearance. Second, druglevels can be used to optimize drug dosage when changing to a new regimen in a patient whose virus hasreduced susceptibility to that drug. For TDM to be useful, the relationship between ARV drug concentrations and anti-HIV effects must be clearly defined. 5-7This association is strongest with protease inhibitors (PI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) serum concentrations also has to be important for maximal anti-HIV activity.9The exposure-toxicity response relationship is less well defined for NRTI drugs but has been determined for some agents.7 Concentration-response relationships have been established with minimum plasma concentrations (Cminor Ctrough ) or area under the curve (AUC), but the optimal measure is not defined for all ARV drugs.10 Table 21 presents recommendations for the minimum target trough concentrations of PIs and NNRTIs inpatients without evidence of resistance to those drugs. In ARV-experienced patients, the choice of minimumtarget trough concentration should be based on results of resistance testing. 11-13Although it is intrinsically difficult to demonstrate benefit of TDM using double-blind studies, limited data suggest targetedconcentrations can be achieved with TDM, clinical responses can be improved with increased or modifieddoses, and TDM information can be helpful in decision making. 8, 14-18Clinicians should consult with a pediatric HIV specialist or pharmacologist in making these decisions. TDM is not recommended for routine use but may be considered potentially useful for patients: In whom clinical response is different from that expected; Who are treatment experienced and infected with virus with reduced drug susceptibility, where a comparison of the drug susceptibility of the virus and the achieved drug concentrations may be useful; Who may experience potential difficulties with drug administration related to suboptimal dietary intake or malabsorption, incorrect dosing or caregiver measuring errors, or concerns surrounding adherence; and Who experience drug or food interactions, including interactions resulting from alteration of drug formulations by crushing medications or mixing them with various foods and liquids.Current limitations for pediatric ARV TDM include: Prolonged time for laboratory processing in the face of potentially diminishing benefit the longer a patient is on inadequate therapy; Difficulties in coordinating sample collections at appropriate times, which make determination of true Cminor AUC difficult; High intrapatient variability from single drug concentration measurements may complicate interpretation of results;19, 20 Single trough measurements within the target range, which do not guarantee consistent adequacy of drug exposure or therapeutic success; Inadequate information on safety and effectiveness of dose adjustment strategies in children and adolescents; Limited availability of certified laboratories capable of assaying drug concentrations; and Lack of third-party reimbursement of costs associated with TDM.

Observational studies of children and youth withunplanned or non-prescribed treatment interruptions suggest that interruptions are common, most patientswill experience immunologic decline during the treatment interruption, and most restart therapy. 1-3Although events precipitating ART interruptions are usually unplanned, planned discontinuation of therapy wasconsidered as a potential strategy to reduce toxicity, costs, and drug-related failure associated with ART.While one trial of children randomized to structured treatment interruptions (STI) with CD4-guidedresumption of cART reported no serious clinical outcomes, 4adult trials have demonstrated significantly higher morbidity and mortality in adults randomized to STI compared with continuous cART.5Long-term STI as a drug-sparing strategy or to give patients \"drug holidays\" is not recommended for children or adultsoutside of a clinical trial. The discussion below provides more detailed guidance for interruption of cARTand the risks and benefits in specific situations. Short-Term Therapy Interruption In children, short-term therapy interruptions are most often necessitated by acute illnesses that limit oralintake. These illnesses are often infectious diseases that result in vomiting and/or diarrhea. A clinician has nochoice but to stop all therapy at the same time. Planned short-term interruption of therapy may also berequired in the event of surgery or sedation for procedures; however, when possible, patients should beallowed to continue regular cART with minimal fluid intake. For a prolonged period of restricted oral intake,all drugs in an ARV regimen should be stopped at the same time if the medications have similar half-lives. Inthe case of serious or life-threatening ARV drug toxicity, all drugs should be stopped immediately. Efavirenz and nevirapine have very long half-lives and can be detected for 21 days or longer after discontinuation. 6-9As the other drugs with shorter half-lives are cleared, only nevirapine or efavirenz may persist, resulting in functional monotherapy, which can increase risk of selection of non-nucleoside reversetranscriptase inhibitors (NNRTI)-resistant mutations. Certain genetic polymorphisms that are more commonin certain racial and ethnic groups (i.e., African Americans, Hispanics) may result in a slower rate of drugclearance. 8, 9To prevent this functional monotherapy, some experts recommend stopping the NNRTI first and continuing the other ARV drugs (NRTI backbone or protease inhibitor [PI]) for a period of time.7An alternative is to substitute a PI for the NNRTI up to 4 weeks before interrupting all drugs; however, there areno data to support this practice. Studies are ongoing in adults to help determine an effective strategy, but information in children is unavailable and, because the PKs of these agents are different in children, the recommendations for adults may not be applicable. 10-12 An additional consideration is reintroduction of nevirapine. Currently, a 2-week, half-dose escalation is recommended in patients who are started on nevirapine. Dose escalation is used because nevirapine induces its own metabolism by inducing CYP3A4 metabolic liver enzymes; thus, initial administration of the full therapeutic dose will result in elevated drug levels until metabolic enzyme induction has occurred. Lower rates of rash toxicity have been observed with the 2-week dose escalation.10In cases where nevirapine has been discontinued for more than 2 weeks, another 2-week dose escalation is recommended when the drug is reintroduced. Long-Term Structured Treatment Interruptions Strategies for STI for long periods of time traditionally have been proposed with the aim of reducing toxicities and costs associated with long-term cART. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection L-35In adults, two large, randomized clinical trials have demonstrated increased morbidity when CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4 cell) count was used as an indication to stop and start therapy. The Strategies forManagement of Antiretroviral Therapy (SMART) trial stopped cART when the CD4 cell count was >350cells/mm 3and reintroduced therapy when the count was <250 cells/mm3. Compared with the group receiving continuous cART, the STI group had an increased risk of disease progression and death.5Interruption of cART was also associated with elevations in biomarkers of inflammation that were predictive of morbidityand mortality independent of CD4 cell count. 13Similarly, in the TRIVICAN trials, which used the same CD4 cell count triggers to stop and restart therapy, STI was shown to be inferior.14Studies in adults using a CD4 cell count <350 cells/mm3as a trigger to restart therapy did not report significant differences in serious disease progression or death.15, 16However, another large cohort study in Italy showed an increased risk of disease progression after interruption of first-line therapy.17In light of these data, the current Department of Health and Human Services guidelines for adults recommend against planned long-term STI in adults (seeAdult and Adolescent Treatment Guidelines ). In children, there have been fewer studies of long-term STI. In one study, children with controlled viral load(HIV RNA <400 copies/mL for >12 months) were subjected to increasing intervals of treatment interruption.Of 14 children studied, 4 maintained undetectable viral loads with interruptions of up to 27 days. It has beenhypothesized that enhanced HIV-specific immune responses may play a role in the viral suppression. 18 However, new drug-resistance mutations were detected in 3 of 14 children in the STI study. In the European(PENTA) trial, 109 children with virologic suppression on cART were randomized to continuous therapy(CT) versus treatment interruption with CD4-guided re-initiation of cART. On average, CD4 valuesdecreased sharply in the first 10 weeks after STI. However, most children in the STI arm (almost 60%) didnot reach CD4 criteria to restart therapy over 48 weeks. Children in the STI arm spent significantly less timeon cART than children in the CT arm. 4None of the children in the trial experienced serious clinical illnesses or events, and the appearance of new drug-resistance mutations did not differ between the two arms.4 In some populations of children, STI has been more specifically considered. In the United States and otherdeveloped countries, most HIV-infected children begin cART during infancy. 19, 20Many of them have had controlled viral replication for many years and are growing and developing normally. One trial was designedto answer whether infants who initiated cART early could safely discontinue therapy at some point andreinitiate treatment based on CD4 cell decline. The CHER study in South Africa assessed outcomes in infantsrandomized to deferred cART (initiation driven by CDC stage and CD4 status), immediate cART withinterruption after 40 weeks, or immediate cART with interruption after 96 weeks. 21, 22While the two arms of interrupted therapy led to better outcomes compared to the deferred arms, up to 80% of infants had to restarttherapy by the end of follow-up. The long-term outcomes in children after this interruption remain unknownand it is unclear if the short period of time on cART saved by most children merits the potential risksassociated with cessation. Another scenario often raised involves patients who have limited treatment options and who cannot achieve an undetectable viral load despite aggressive cART. In such cases, continuation of non-suppressive therapy is recommended because, despite detectable viral replication, immunologic benefit has been well documented. 23-26 Given the increased availability of medications with less toxicity, the potential benefits of long-term STI may be decreasing. Current data do not support use of long-term STI in clinical care of HIV-infected children. References 1. Gibb DM, Duong T, Leclezio V A, et al.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection L-37Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection M-1Antiretroviral Drug-Resistance Testing (Last updated November 1, 2012; last reviewed November 1, 2012) HIV Drug-Resistance and Resistance Assays HIV replication is a continuous process in most untreated patients, leading to the daily production of billions of viral particles. The goal of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is to suppress HIV replication as rapidly and fully as possible, indicated by a reduction in plasma HIV RNA to below the limit of detection of the most sensitive assays available. Unfortunately, mutations in HIV RNA readily arise during viral quantification because HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) is a highly error-prone enzyme. Consequently, ongoing replication in the presence of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs readily and progressively selects for strains of HIV with mutations that confer drug resistance. Drug-resistance detection methods vary depending on the class of ARV agents. Viral coreceptor (tropism) assays have been successfully used to detect virus with tropism that will (CCR5 tropism) or will not (CXCR4 or mixed tropism) be CCR5 antagonists. Both assays and phenotypic assays currentlyPanel's Recommendations Antiretroviral (ARV) drug-resistance testing is recommended before initiation of therapy in all treatment-naive children (AII). Genotypic resistance testing is preferred for this purpose (AIII). ARV drug resistance testing is recommended before changing therapy because of treatment failure (AI*). Resistance testing in patients with virological failure should be done while they are still on the failing regimen or within 4 weeks of discontinuation (AII*). Phenotypic resistance testing should be used (usually in addition to genotypic resistance testing) for patients with known or suspected complex drug resistance mutation patterns, which generally arise after virologic failure of successive ARV therapy regimens (BIII). The absence of detectable resistance to a drug does not ensure that use of the drug will be successful. Consequently, previously used ARV agents and previous resistance test results should be reviewed when making decisions regardingthe choice of new agents for patients with virologic failure (AII). Viral coreceptor (tropism) assays should be used whenever the use of a CCR5 antagonist is being considered (AI*). Tropism assays should also be considered for patients who demonstrate virologic failure while receiving therapy thatcontains a CCR5 antagonist (AI*). Consultation with a specialist in pediatric HIV infection is recommended for interpretation of resistance assays when considering starting or changing an ARV regimen in pediatric patients (AI*). Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = One or more randomized trials in childrenwith clinical outcomes and/or validated endpoints; I* = One or more randomized trials in adults with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; II = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies in childrenwith long-term outcomes; II* = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational studies in adults with long-term clinical outcomes with accompanying data in childrenfrom one or more similar nonrandomized trials or cohort studies with clinical outcome data; III = expert opinion Studies that include children or children and adolescents but not studies limited to postpubertal adolescentsare used to detect the presence of virus that is resistant to inhibitors of the HIV RT, integrase (IN), or protease (PR). Clinical experience with testing for viral resistance to other agents is more limited, butgenotypic assays that assess mutations in gp41 (envelope) genes also are commercially available. Experienceis also limited with the use of commercially available genotypic and phenotypic assays in the evaluation ofdrug resistance in patients infected subtypes of HIV . 1 Genotypic Assays Genotypic assays resistance to RT PR inhibitors and integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) arebased on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and analysis of the RT, PR, and IN codingsequences present in HIV RNA extracted from plasma. Genotypic assays can detect resistance associatedmutations in plasma samples containing approximately 1,000 copies/mL or more of HIV RNA and resultsgenerally are available within 1 to 2 weeks of sample collection. 2Interpretation of test results requires knowledge of the mutations selected by different ARV drugs and of the potential for cross resistance to otherdrugs conferred by certain mutations. For some drugs, the genetic barrier to the development of resistance islow, and a single nucleotide mutation is enough to confer high-level resistance sufficient to remove anyclinical utility of the drug. This is exemplified by resistance to nevirapine resulting from mutations in theHIV RT. Other mutations lead to drug resistance but simultaneously impair HIV replication. Clinically usefulactivity of the ARV agent may therefore remain, as demonstrated by evidence of continued clinical benefitfrom lamivudine in individuals with evidence of the high-level resistance engendered by the M184V RTmutation. 3By contrast, HIV evolution to high-level resistance to some drugs is associated with the emergence of mutations that confer the resistance as well as compensatory mutations that allow the virus toreplicate more efficiently in the presence of the ARV agent. The International AIDS Society-USA (IAS-USA) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database maintain lists of significant resistance-associated mutations relevant to currently available ARVdrugs (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations , or http://hivdb.stanford.edu ). A variety of online tools that take into account the ability of some mutations selected by one drug to cause partial or full crossresistance with other drugs are now available to assist the provider in interpreting genotypic test results.Although the response to ART in children and adolescents is not always predicted by the results of genotypicresistance assays, clinical trials in adults have demonstrated the benefit of resistance testing combined withconsultation with specialists in HIV drug resistance in improving virologic outcomes. 2, 4-10Given the potential complexity of interpretation of genotypic resistance, it is recommended that clinicians consult witha specialist in pediatric HIV infection for assistance in the interpretation of genotypic results and design of anoptimal new regimen. Phenotypic Assays Phenotypic resistance assays provide a more direct assessment of the impact on viral replication of mutations that are present among an individual's HIV variants. As they are most often performed, phenotypic assays involve PCR amplification of the RT, IN, PR, or gp41 envelope gene sequences from patient plasma and insertion of those amplified patient sequences into the backbone of a cloned strain of HIV that expresses a reporter gene. Replication of this recombinant virus in the presence of a range of drug concentrations is monitored by quantification of the reporter gene and is compared with replication of a reference drug susceptible HIV variant. The drug concentration that inhibits viral replication by 50% (that is, the mean inhibitory concentration, or IC50) is calculated, and the ratio of the IC50of test and reference viruses is reported as the fold increase in IC50(i.e., fold resistance change). Automated, recombinant phenotypic assays that can produce results in 2 to 3 weeks are commercially available; however, they are more costly than genotypic assays. Analytic techniques have also been developed to use the genotype to predict the likelihood of a drug-resistant phenotype. This bioinformatic approach, currently applicable for RT, IN, and PR inhibitor resistance only, Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection M-2Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection M-3matches the pattern of mutations obtained from the patient sample with a large database of samples for which both genotype and phenotype are known. Therefore, the sample is assigned a predicted phenotypesusceptibility (or \"virtual phenotype\") based on the data from specimens matching the patient's genotype.The primary limitations of this approach are that its predictive power depends upon the sensitivity of thegenotypic methods used and the number of matches to the patient's genotype. Tropism (Viral Coreceptor Usage) Assays HIV enters cells by a complex, multistep process that involves sequential interactions between the HIVenvelope protein molecules and the CD4 receptor, and then with either the CCR5 or CXCR4 coreceptormolecules, culminating in the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. Viruses initially are CCR5 tropic inthe majority of untreated individuals, including infants and children infected by mother-to-child transmission(MTCT) of HIV . However, a shift in coreceptor tropism often occurs over time, from CCR5 usage to ARV-treated patients drug are more likely to harbor detectable CXCR4- or D/M-tropic virus than untreatedpatients with comparable CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4 cell) counts. 11 Resistance to CCR5 antagonists is detected using specialized phenotypic assay methods (Phenoscript[VIRalliance] and Trofile [Monogram Biosciences, the ofrecombinant viruses bearing patient-derived envelope proteins (gp120 and gp41). The relative capacity ofthese pseudoviruses to infect cells bearing the cell surface proteins CCR5 or CXCR4 is quantified based onthe expression of a reporter gene. Any indication of CXCR4 usage by virus detected in a patient is a contraindication to the use of the CCR5 antagonists as part of a therapeutic regimen. Coreceptor use assays should be performed before a CCR5inhibitor is used and should be considered in patients exhibiting virologic failure on a CCR5 inhibitor such asmaraviroc. The Trofile assay takes about 2 weeks to perform and requires a plasma viral load 1,000 copies/mL. The initial version of the Trofile assay used during the clinical trials that led to the licensure of maraviroc wasable to detect CXCR4-tropic virus with 100% sensitivity when present at a frequency of 10% of the plasmavirus population but only 83% sensitivity when the variant was present at a frequency of 5%. In initialclinical trials of CCR5 antagonist drugs, this sensitivity threshold was not always sufficient to exclude thepresence of clinically meaningful levels of CXCR4- or D/M-tropic virus in patients initiating a CCR5inhibitor-based regimen. The current version of the Trofile assay has improved sensitivity and is able todetect CXCR4- or D/M-tropic virus representing as little as 0.3% of the plasma virus. 12, 13 One of the tropism assays also can be performed following amplification of HIV sequences from peripheralblood DNA (Trofile-DNA [Monogram Biosciences, Inc.]) and may be useful when a change to a regimen containing a CCR5 antagonist is being considered for an individual with an undetectable plasma viral load. Limitations of Current Resistance and Tropism Assays Limitations of the genotypic, phenotypic, and phenotype-prediction assay approaches include lack of uniform quality assurance testing and high cost. In addition, drug-resistant variants are likely to exist at low levels in every HIV-infected patient. Drug-resistant viruses that constitute <10% to 20% of the circulating virus population or are present in the reservoir of latently infected cells may not be detected by any of the currently available commercial resistance assays.14Consequently, a review of the past use of ARV agents is important in making decisions regarding the choice of new agents for patients with virologic failure. Genotypic assays have been proposed as an alternative approach to detemining the tropism of plasma HIV . However, they are not currently recommended because the limited experience with this approach indicates that the sensitivity and specificity are lower than phenotypic tropism assays.15Although drug resistance may be detected in infants, children, and adults who are not receiving therapy at the time of the assay, loss of detectable resistance and reversion to predominantly wild-type virus often occur inthe first 4 to 6 weeks after ARV drugs are stopped. 16-18As a result, resistance testing is of greatest value when performed within 4 weeks after drugs are discontinued. The absence of detectable resistance to a drug at thetime of testing does not ensure that future use of the drug will be successful, 19especially if the agent shares cross resistance with drugs previously used. It may be prudent to repeat resistance testing if an incompletevirological response to a new treatment regimen is observed in an individual with prior treatment failure(s)(see Management of Treatment-Experienced Infants, Children, and Adolescents ). Use of Resistance Assays in Determining Initial Treatment MTCT transmission and behavioral transmission of drug-resistant HIV strains have been well documentedand are associated with suboptimal virologic response to initial ART. 20-24Drug-resistant variants of HIV may persist for months after birth in infected infants25and impair the response to ART.26Consequently, ARV drug-resistance testing is recommended for all treatment-naive children before therapy is initiated. Genotypictesting is preferred in this setting because it may reveal the presence of both resistance mutations andpolymorphisms that facilitate the replication of drug-resistant virus. Use of Resistance Assays in the Event of Virologic Failure Several studies in adults2, 4-10have indicated that early virologic responses to salvage regimens were improved when results of resistance testing were available to guide changes in therapy, compared withresponses observed when changes in therapy were guided only by clinical judgment. Although not yetconfirmed in children, 27resistance testing appears to be a useful tool in selecting active drugs when changing ARV regimens in cases of virologic failure. Resistance testing also can help guide treatment decisions forpatients with suboptimal viral load reduction because virologic failure in the setting of combination ARTmay be associated with resistance to only one component of the regimen. 1Poor adherence should be suspected when no evidence of resistance to a failing regimen is identified (see Management of Treatment- Experienced Infants, Children, and Adolescents ).

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection M-6Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection N-1Conclusion (Last updated August 11, 2011; last reviewed November 1, 2012) The care of HIV-infected children is complex and evolving rapidly as results of new research are reported and new antiretroviral (ARV) drugs and newer classes of drugs are approved. Clinical trials to defineappropriate drug dosing and toxicity in children ranging in age from infancy to adolescence are critical asnew drugs become available. As additional ARV drugs become approved and optimal use of these drugs inchildren becomes better understood, the Panel will modify these guidelines. It should be noted thatguidelines are only a starting point for medical decision making and are not meant to supersede the judgmentof clinicians experienced in the care of HIV-infected children. Because of the complexity of caring for HIV-infected children, health care providers with limited experience in the care of these patients should consultwith a pediatric HIV specialist. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the HIVMedicine Association (HIVMA) of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the Pediatric InfectiousDisease Society (PIDS), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) jointly developed and publishedguidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-exposed and -infected children;these guidelines are available at http://aidsinfo.nih.gov .1Similar guidelines for adults are also available at the same website.2 References 1.

Several observational cohort studies suggest increased risk of myocardial infarction inadults with recent or current use of ABC;however, other studies have not substantiatedthis finding, and there are no data in children. Special Instructions Test patients for the HLA-B*5701 allele before starting therapy to predict risk ofhypersensitivity; patients with the HLA-B*5701 allele should not be given ABC.Patients with no prior HLA-B*5701 testingwho are tolerating ABC do not need to betested. ABC can be given without regard to food. Caution patients and parents about risk of serious HSR that can be fatal. Do not re- challenge.

Thus, it should not cause changes in clearance of agents metabolized through these pathways, such as protease inhibitors (PIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Abacavir is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase and glucuronyl Alcohol increases abacavir levels by 41%. Major Toxicities:More common: Nausea, vomiting, fever, headache, diarrhea, rash, and anorexia. Less common (more severe): Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) observed in approximately 5% of adults and children (rate varies by race/ethnicity) receivingabacavir. Hypersensitivity to abacavir is a multi-organ clinical syndrome usually characterized byrash or signs or symptoms in two or more of the following groups: (1) fever; (2) constitutional,including malaise, fatigue, or achiness; (3) gastrointestinal, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, orabdominal pain; or (4) respiratory, including dyspnea, cough, or pharnygitis. Laboratory and imagingabnormalities include elevated liver function tests, elevated creatine phosphokinase, elevatedcreatinine, lymphopenia, and pulmonary infiltrates. This reaction generally occurs in the first 6weeks of therapy and has occurred after a single dose. If an HSR is suspected, abacavir should bestopped and not restarted because hypotension and death have occurred upon re-challenge.Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported.Pancreatitis can occur. Rare: Increased liver enzymes, elevated blood glucose, elevated triglycerides, and possible increased risk of myocardial infarction (in observational studies in adults). Resistance: The International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (seehttp://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/ABC.html ). Pediatric Use: Abacavir is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for use in HIV-infectedchildren as one of the drugs for part of the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) component of antiretroviral therapy (ART). The liquid formulation of abacavir is more palatable than zidovudine; it has less of an effect on mitochondrial function than zidovudine, stavudine, or didanosine; and it has more durable antiviral effectiveness in pediatric trials. 1, 2The risk of abacavir hypersensitivity syndrome, the major toxicity limiting abacavir's use, is greatly reduced by testing patients for HLA-B*5701 and by not using abacavir in those who test positive for the HLA-B*5701 allele. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies of abacavir in children aged <12 years have demonstrated that childrenEpzicom Adolescent ( 16 years of age)/adult dose: One tablet once daily.patients on dialysis, or those with impaired hepatic function.have more rapid clearance of abacavir than adults and that pediatric doses approximately twice the directly scaled adult dose are necessary to achieve similar systemic exposure.3, 4Metabolic clearance of abacavir in adolescents and young adults (ages 13-25 years) is slower than that observed in youngerchildren and approximates clearance seen in older adults. 5 Plasma area under the drug concentration by time curve (AUC) correlates with virologic efficacy ofabacavir, although the association is weak. 6, 7Intracellular concentrations of NRTIs are most strongly associated with antiviral effectiveness, and the active form of abacavir is the intracellular metabolitecarbovir triphosphate. 8, 9Measurement of intracellular triphosphate is difficult than measurement of plasma AUC, so the abacavir plasma AUC is often taken as a proxy measurement forintracellular concentrations. However, this relationship is not sufficiently strong that changes in plasmaAUC can be assumed to reflect true changes in intracellular active drug. For example, although overallintracellular carbovir triphosphate was correlated with abacavir plasma AUC, this relationship was notfound when gender was considered in PK modeling 10because carbovir triphosphate concentrations were higher in females than in males.10-12This effect of gender on intracellular triphosphates has also been found with zidovudine and lamivudine.8, 13 In studies in adults, abacavir plasma AUC is decreased 17% by concurrent use of atazanavir/ritonavirand decreased 32% by concurrent use of lopinavir/ritonavir. 14In a study comparing PK parameters of abacavir in either lopinavir/ritonavir or nevirapine, abacavir plasma AUC wasdecreased the carbovir triphosphate concentrationseemed to increase in the lopinavir/ritonavir group. 12 These effects of gender and concurrent PI use add to the complexity of linking readily available plasmaabacavir AUC with more difficult to obtain but pharmacodynamically more important intracellularcarbovir triphosphate concentrations. These effects also need to be kept in mind when considering datasupporting the use of once-daily abacavir in children (presented in the table below). Abacavir 600 mg once daily is standard for use in adults, but once-daily use for children is still controversial. The PENTA-13 crossover trial studied abacavir 16 mg/kg once daily versus 8 mg/kg twicedaily in 24 children aged 2 to 13 years who had undetectable or low, stable viral loads at the time ofchanging from twice-daily to once-daily abacavir. This study showed equivalent AUC 0-24for both drugs and improved acceptability in the once-daily dosing arm.15, 16However, trough concentrations were lower in younger (aged 2-6 years) receiving the once-daily regimen.16The PENTA-15 crossover trial studied 18 children aged 3 to 36 months, again comparing abacavir 16 mg/kg once dailyversus 8 mg/kg twice daily in children with viral loads <400 copies/mL or \"stable\" on twice-dailyabacavir at baseline. AUC were similar on the once- and twice-daily regimens. After the change from twice-daily to once-daily abacavir, viral load remained <400 copies/mL in 16 of 18 participants through 48 weeks of monitoring.17A study of 41 children aged 3 to 6 years (median age 7.6 years) in Uganda who were stable on twice-daily abacavir also showed equivalent AUC0-24and good clinical outcome (disease stage and CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4 cell) count) after the switch to once-dailyabacavir, with median follow-up of 1.15 years. Viral load testing was not done. 18 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-4Abacavir Steady State Pharmacokinetics When Dosed Once Daily or Twice Daily No clinical trials exist involving children who initiated ART with once-daily dosing of abacavir. All three pediatric studies described in the table above enrolled only patients who had low viral loads orwere \"clinically stable\" on twice-daily abacavir before changing to once-daily dosing. Therefore, thePanel suggests that in clinically stable patients with undetectable viral loads and stable CD4 cell counts,switching to once-daily dosing of abacavir (at a dose of 16 to 20 mg/kg/dose to maximum of 600 mgonce daily) can be considered.

Pancreatitis (less common in children than in adults, more common in adults when ddI isused in combination with tenofovir [TDF] ord4T) Non-cirrhotic portal hypertension Retinal changes, optic neuritis Insulin resistance/diabetes mellitus Special Instructions Because food decreases absorption of ddI, administration of ddI on an empty stomach (30 minutes before or 2 hours after a meal)generally is recommended. To improveadherence, some practitioners administer ddIwithout regard to timing of meals (see textbelow). ddI oral solution contains antacids that may interfere with the absorption of othermedications, including protease inhibitors(PIs). See individual protease inhibitor forinstructions on timing of administration. Thisinteraction is more pronounced for thebuffered (solution) formulation of ddI, thanfor the enteric coated formulation.Body Weight (kg) Dose (mg) 20 kg to <25 kg 200 mg once daily 25 kg to <60 kg 250 mg once daily 60 kg 400 mg once dailyGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-9Drug Interactions (see also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents ): Absorption: The presence of antacids in didanosine suspension has the potential to decrease the absorption of a number of medications if given at the same time. Many of these interactions can be avoided by timing doses to avoid giving other medications concurrently with didanosine suspension. Mechanism unknown: Didanosine serum concentrations are increased when didanosine is co- administered with tenofovir and this combination should be avoided if possible. Renal elimination: Drugs that decrease renal function can decrease didanosine clearance. Enhanced toxicity: Didanosine mitochondrial toxicity is enhanced by ribavirin. Overlapping toxicities: Risk of pancreatitis and peripheral neuropathy is increased with use of some nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (such as stavudine). The combination ofstavudine and didanosine is not recommended (unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks)because of overlapping toxicities and reports of serious, even fatal, cases of lactic acidosis withhepatic steatosis with or without pancreatitis in pregnant women. Major Toxicities: More common: Diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Less common (more severe): Peripheral neuropathy, electrolyte abnormalities, and hyperuricemia. Lactic acidosis and steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported.Adolescent/adult dose: ddI in combination with TDF: This combination should be avoided, if possible, because of enhanced ddI toxicity. Pediatric/adolescent dose of ddI when combined with TDF: No data on this combination in children or adolescents aged <18 years, but decrease inddI dose is recommended as in adults. Adult dose of ddI when combined with TDF:Body Weight (kg) Dose (mg) <60 kg 250 mg once daily 60 kg 400 mg once daily Body Weight (kg) Dose (mg) <60 kg (limited data in adults)200 mg once daily 60 kg 250 mg once daily Shake ddI oral solution well before use. Keep refrigerated; solution is stable for 30 days. Metabolism Renal excretion 50%. Dosing of ddI in patients with renal insufficiency : Decreased dosage should be used in patients with impaired renal function. Consult manufacturer's prescribinginformation for adjustment of dosage inaccordance with creatinine clearance.Pancreatitis (less common in children than in adults, more common in adults when used in combination with tenofovir or stavudine), increased liver enzymes, and retinal depigmentation andoptic neuritis have been reported. The combination of stavudine with didanosine may result inenhanced toxicity (increased risk of fatal and nonfatal cases of lactic acidosis or pancreatitis); thiscombination should not be used unless the potential benefit clearly outweighs the potential risk. Rare: Non-cirrhotic portal hypertension, presenting clinically with hematemesis, esophageal varices, ascites, and splenomegaly, and associated with increased transaminases, increased alkalinephosphatase, and thrombocytopenia, has been associated with long-term didanosine use in adults. 1-3 In adults, use of didanosine may be associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction.4 Resistance: The International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (seehttp://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/ddI.html ). Pediatric Use: Didanosine is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for use in children as part of a dual-NRTI backbone in combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Recommended doses of didanosine oral solution in children have traditionally been 90 to 150 mg/m2body surface area per dose twice daily. Doses higher than 180 mg/m2body surface area twice daily are associated with increased toxicity.5The pharmacokinetic (PK) variable of greatest pharmacodynamic significance is the area under the curve (AUC), with virologic response best when didanosine AUC 0.60 mg*h/L.6, 7In a simulation based on didanosine concentration data from 16 children, a dose of 90 mg/m2 body surface area twice daily was predicted to result in adequate drug exposure in only 57% of pediatricpatients, compared with adequate exposure predicted in 88% of patients at a dose of 120 mg/m 2body surface area twice daily,7which is the currently recommended dose for children aged 8 months to 3 years. For infants aged 2 weeks to 8 months, the FDA recommends 100 mg/m2body surface area per dose twice daily, increasing to 120 mg/m2body surface area per dose twice daily at age 8 months. However, 2 small studies suggest that a higher AUC is seen in infants aged <6 weeks and that a dose of 100 mg/m2body surface area per day (either as 50 mg/m2body surface area per dose twice daily or 100 mg/m2body surface area once daily) in infants aged <6 weeks achieves AUCs consistent with those for higher doses in olderchildren. 8, 9Therefore, because these PK differences in younger infants (aged 2 weeks-3 months) compared with older children raise concern for increased toxicity in that age group, the Panel recommendsa dose of 50 mg/m 2of body surface area twice daily for infants younger than 3 months. A once-daily dosing regimen may be preferable to promote adherence, and multiple studies support the favorable PKs and efficacy of once-daily dosing. In a study of 10 children aged 4 to 10 years, ECdidanosine (Videx EC) administered as a single dose of 240 mg/m 2body surface area once daily was shown to have similar plasma AUC (although lower peak plasma concentrations) compared with the equivalent dose of buffered didanosine.8The resultant intracellular (active) drug concentrations are unknown. In 24 HIV-infected children, didanosine oral solution at a dose of 180 mg/m2body surface area once daily was compared with 90 mg/m2body surface area twice daily, and the AUC was actually higher in the once-daily group than in the twice-daily group.10Long-term virologic suppression with a once-daily regimen of efavirenz, emtricitabine, and didanosine (oral solution or EC beadlet capsules) was reported in 37 treatment-naive children aged 3 to 21 years.11The didanosine dose used in that study was 240 mg/m2/dose once daily, and PK analysis showed no dose changes were needed to reach PK targets.11A European trial of once-daily combination therapy in 36 children aged 3 to 11 years that included didanosine at a dose of 200 to 240 mg/m2body surface area demonstrated safety and efficacy with up to 96 weeks of follow up.12In 53 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-10children with advanced symptomatic HIV infection, once- versus twice-daily didanosine at a dose of 270 mg/m2body surface area per day showed no difference in surrogate marker or clinical endpoints, except that weight gain was less in the children given once-daily therapy.13In 51 children (median age 6.0 years, range 2.5 to 15.0 years) in Burkina Faso, the once-daily combination of didanosine-lamivudine-efavirenzresulted in week-48 viral load <300 copies/mL in 81% of treated participants. That study used didanosine ata dose of 240 mg/m 2/day, administered in the fasting state as tablets with a separate antacid (not enteric- coated capsules).6 Although the prescribing information recommends taking didanosine on an empty stomach, this isimpractical for infants who must be fed frequently and it may decrease medication adherence byincreasing regimen complexity. A comparison showed that regardless of whether didanosine oral solutionwas given to children with or without food systemic exposure measured by AUC was similar; absorptionof didanosine administered with food was slower and elimination more prolonged. 14To improve adherence, some practitioners administer didanosine without regard to timing of meals. Studies in adultssuggest that didanosine can be given without regard to food. 15, 16A European study dosed didanosine oral solution as part of a four-drug regimen either 1 hour before or 1 hour after meals, but allowed theextended-release formulation to be given without food restriction, and showed good virologic outcomewith up to 96 weeks of follow-up. 17 References 1.

Pediatric Use: Emtricitabine is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for once-daily administration in children starting at birth. Owing to its once-a-day dosing, minimal toxicity, and pediatric pharmacokinetic (PK) data, emtricitabine is commonly used as part of a dual-NRTI backbonein antiretroviral therapy (ART).

Plasma concentrations in children receiving the 6 mg/kg emtricitabine once-daily dose were approximately equivalent to those inadults receiving the standard 200-mg dose. Based on this dose-finding study, emtricitabine was given at a dose of 6 mg/kg once daily in combination with other antiretroviral (ARV) drugs. 2, 3PK results were similar to the preceding dose- finding study.1Follow-up data extending to Week 96 indicated that 89% of the ARV-naive and 76% of the ARV-experienced children maintained suppression of plasma HIV RNA <400 copies/mL (74% ofARV-naive children and toxicity wasobserved in this trial. In PACTG P1021, emtricitabine at a dose of 6 mg/kg (maximum 240 mg/day as liquid or 200 mg/day as capsules) in combination with didanosine and efavirenz, all given once daily, was studied in 37 ARV-naive HIV-infected children aged 3 months to 21 years. 2Eighty-five percent of children achieved HIV RNA <400 copies/mL and 72% maintained HIV RNA suppression to <50 copies/mL through 96 weeksof therapy. The median CD4 T lymphocyte count rose by 329 cells/mm 3at Week 96. A study in South Africa evaluated the PKs of emtricitabine in 20 HIV-exposed infants aged <3 months,given emtricitabine as 3 mg/kg once daily for two, 4-day courses, separated by an interval of 2 weeks. 4 Emtricitabine exposure (area under the curve [AUC]) in neonates receiving 3 mg/kg emtricitabine oncedaily was in the range of pediatric patients aged >3 months receiving the recommended emtricitabinedose of 6 mg/kg once daily and adults receiving the once-daily recommended 200-mg emtricitabine dose(AUC approximately 10 hr*ug/mL). Over the first 3 months of life, emtricitabine AUC decreased withincreasing age, correlating with an increase in total body clearance of the drug. In a small group ofneonates (N = 6) receiving a single dose of emtricitabine 3 mg/kg after a single maternal dose of 600 mgduring delivery, the AUC exceeded that seen in adults and older children, but the half-life (9.2 hrs) wassimilar. 5Extensive safety data are lacking in this age range.

Drug Interactions: (see also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents ): Renal elimination: Drugs that decrease renal function could decrease clearance of lamivudine. Other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs): Do not use lamivudine in combination with emtricitabine because of the similar resistance profiles and no additive benefit.1 Major Toxicities: More common: Headache, pancreatitis, Rare: and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported. Resistance: The International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/3TC.html ). Pediatric Use: Lamivudine is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for use in children aged 3 months, and it is a common component of most nucleoside backbone regimens.Lamivudine has been studied in HIV-infected children alone and in combination with other antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, and extensive data demonstrate that lamivudine appears safe and is associated with clinicalimprovement and virologic response. 2-17Lamivudine is commonly used in HIV-infected children as a component of a dual-NRTI backbone.3, 4, 6, 7, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17In one study, the NRTI background components of lamivudine/abacavir were superior to zidovudine/lamivudine or zidovudine/abacavir in long-term virologic efficacy.18Weight-band dosing recommendations for lamivudine have been developed for children weighing at least 14 kg and receiving the 150 mg scored tablets.19, 20 Because of its safety profile and availability in a liquid formulation, lamivudine has been given to infants during the first 6 weeks of life starting at a dose of 2 mg/kg every 12 hours before age 4 weeks.11A population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of infants receiving lamivudine affirms that adjusting the dose of lamivudine from 2 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg every 12 hours at age 4 weeks for infants with normal maturation of renal function provides optimal lamivudine exposure.21For infants in the first 2 weeks of life, weight-band dosing has also been used. In HPTN 040, all infants weighing >2000 g received 6 mg twice daily and infants weighing 2000 greceived 4 mg twice daily for 2 weeks. These doses resulted in similar lamivudine exposure as in infantsreceiving the standard 2 mg/kg/dose twice daily dosing schedule for neonates.22 The standard adult dosage for lamivudine is 300 mg once daily, but few data are available regarding once-daily administration of lamivudine in children. Population PK data indicate that once-daily dosingof 8 mg/kg leads to area under the curve (AUC) 0-24values similar to 4 mg/kg twice daily but Cmin values significantly lower and Cmaxvalues significantly higher in children ages 1 to 18 years.23Intensive PKs of once-daily versus twice-daily dosing of lamivudine were evaluated in HIV-infected children ages2 to 13 years in the PENTA-13 trial 2and in children 3 to 36 months of age in the PENTA 15 trial.24Both trials were crossover design with doses of lamivudine of 8 mg/kg/once daily or 4 mg/kg/twice daily. AUC 0-24and clearance values were similar and most children maintained an undetectable plasma RNA value after the switch. A study of 41 children ages 3 to 12 years (median age 7.6 years) inUganda who were stable on twice-daily lamivudine also showed equivalent AUC 0-24and good clinical outcome (disease stage and CD4 T lymphocyte [CD4 cell] count) after a switch to once-dailylamivudine, with median follow-up of 1.15 years. 25All three studies enrolled only patients who had low viral load or were clinically stable on twice-daily lamivudine before changing to once-daily dosing.Nacro et al studied a once-daily regimen in ARV-naive children in Burkina-Faso composed of non-enteric-coated didanosine (ddI), lamivudine, and efavirenz. Fifty-one children ranging in age from 30months to 15 years were enrolled in this open-label, Phase II study lasting 12 months. 26The patients had advanced HIV infection with a mean CD4 percentage of 9 and a median plasma RNA of 5.51 log10/ copies/mL. At 12-month follow-up, 50% of RNA <50 copies/mL and 80% were<300 copies/mL with Twenty-two percent of patientsharbored multi-class-resistant viral strains. While PK values were similar to the PENTA and ARROWtrials, the study was complicated by use of non-enteric-coated ddI, severe immunosuppression, and non-clade B virus. In addition, rates of virologic failure and resistance profiles were not separated by age.Therefore, the Panel supports consideration of switching to once-daily dosing of lamivudine from twice-daily dosing in clinically stable patients aged 3 years and older with a reasonable once-daily regimen, anundetectable viral load, and stable CD4 cell count, at a dose of 8 to 10 mg/kg/dose to a maximum of 300mg once daily. More long-term clinical trials with viral efficacy endpoints are needed to confirm thatonce-daily dosing of lamivudine can be used effectively to initiate antiretroviral therapy in children.

Pediatric dose (at least 14 days old and weighing <30 kg): 1 mg/kg twice daily Adolescent 30 mg twice daily.Stavudine (d4T, Zerit) (Last updated November 1, 2012; last reviewed November 1, 2012) For additional information see Drugs@FDA: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm Formulations Powder for Oral Solution: 1 mg/mL Capsules: 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg Generic: d4T capsules and solution have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for manufacture and distribution in the United States. Drug Interactions (see also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents ): Renal elimination: Drugs that decrease renal function could decrease stavudine clearance. Other NRTIs: Stavudine should not be administered in combination with zidovudine because of virologic antagonism.Selected nucleoside reverse transcriptaseinhibitors [NRTIs]). The risk is increasedwhen used in combination with ddI. Hyperlipidemia Insulin resistance/diabetes mellitus Rapidly progressive ascending neuromuscular weakness (rare) Special Instructions d4T can be given without regard to food. Shake d4T oral solution well before use. Keep refrigerated; the solution will remain stable for 30 days. Metabolism Renal excretion 50%. Decrease dose in renal dysfunction.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-23Overlapping toxicities: The combination of stavudine and didanosine is not recommended for initial therapy because of overlapping toxicities. Reported toxicities are more often reported in adults and include serious, even fatal, cases of lactic acidosis with hepatic steatosis Hepatic decompensation (sometimes fatal) has occurred in HIV/hepatitis C virus co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (ART),interferon, and ribavirin. Major Toxicities: More common: Headache, gastrointestinal rashes, and Less common (more severe): Peripheral sensory neuropathy is dose-related and occurs more frequently in patients with advanced HIV disease, a history of peripheral neuropathy, and inthose patients receiving other drugs andsevere hepatomegaly been reported. Thecombination of stavudine with didanosine may result in enhanced toxicity (increased risk of fataland nonfatal cases of lactic acidosis, pancreatitis, peripheral neuropathy, and hepatotoxicity),particularly in adults, including pregnant women. This combination should not be used for initialtherapy. Risk factors found to be associated with lactic acidosis in adults include female gender,obesity, and prolonged nucleoside exposure. 1 Rare: Increased liver enzymes and hepatic toxicity which may be severe or fatal. Neurologic symptoms including rapidly progressive ascending neuromuscular weakness are most often seenin the setting of lactic acidosis. Resistance: The International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ), and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (seehttp://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/d4T.html ). Pediatric Use: Although stavudine is FDA-approved for use in children, its use is limited because it carries a higher risk of side effects associated with mitochondrial toxicity and a higher incidence oflipoatrophy than other NRTIs. Data from multiple pediatric studies of stavudine alone or in combination with other antiretroviral agents demonstrate that stavudine appears safe and is associated with clinical and virologic response. 2-8In resource-limited countries, stavudine is frequently a component of initial ART therapy with lamivudineand nevirapine in children, often as a component of fixed-dose combinations not available in the United States. In this setting, reported outcomes from observational studies are good; data show substantialincreases in the CD4 T lymphocyte count and complete viral suppression in 50% to 80% of treatment-naive children. 9-12In such a setting, where pediatric patients are already predisposed to anemia because of malnutrition, parasitic infestations, or sickle cell anemia, stavudine carries a lower risk ofhematologic toxicity than zidovudine, especially in patients receiving cotrimoxazole prophylaxis. 13 Stavudine is associated with a higher rate of adverse events than zidovudine in adults and childrenreceiving ART. 14, 15In a large pediatric natural history study (PACTG 219C), stavudine-containing regimens had a modest but significantly higher rate of clinical and laboratory toxicities than those containing zidovudine, with pancreatitis, peripheral neuropathy, and (fat maldistribution) often stavudine use.15Peripheral neuropathy is an importanttoxicity associated with stavudine but appears to be less common in children than in adults.3, 16In PACTG 219C, peripheral neuropathy was recognized and specifically lipoatrophy (loss of subcutaneous fat), are toxicities associated with NRTIs, particularly stavudine, in adults and children.17-20Lipodystrophy developed in 28% of 39 children receiving stavudine, lamivudine, and nelfinavir after a median of 49 months of therapy, with 9 childrendemonstrating lipoatrophy. 21Among 90 children receiving 65% developed lipodystrophy by 33 months.22Among 100 pre-pubertal African children, the prevalence of lipoatrophy was found to be 37% with a strong correlation with duration on stavudinetherapy. 23Improvements in lipodystrophy were observed among Thai children after of stavudine with zidovudine.24 Lactic acidosis with hepatic steatosis, including fatal cases, has been reported with use of nucleosideanalogues, including stavudine, alone or in combination with didanosine (ddI). 25-27In adults, female gender, higher body mass index (BMI), and lower initial CD4 cell count are risk factors for developinglactic acidosis and hyperlactatemia. 1The combination of stavudine and didanosine in pregnant women has been associated with fatal lactic acidosis and should be used during pregnancy only if no otheralternatives are available. 28(For additional information on lactic acidosis see Table 17. Antiretroviral Therapy-Associated Adverse Effects and Management Recommendations .) Many of the above-mentioned adverse events are believed to be due to mitochondrial toxicity resultingfrom inhibition of mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma, with depletion of mitochondrial DNA in fat,muscle, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and other tissues. 25, 29-31In a recent analysis involving a large cohort of pediatric patients (Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group protocols 219 and 219C),possible mitochondrial dysfunction was associated with NRTI use, especially in children receivingstavudine and/or lamivudine. 32 The World Health Organization recommends that stavudine be phased out of use because of unacceptabletoxicity, with a strong recommendation that a maximum stavudine dose of 30 mg twice daily be usedinstead of the FDA-recommended 40 mg twice daily in patients weighing 60 kg or more. 33, 34Several studies have compared the efficacy and toxicity of the two doses: HIV suppression was found to be similarin adults treated in South Africa with either the 30-mg or 40-mg dose; 35in adults treated in South Africa, incidence of peripheral neuropathy was significantly lower in the 30-mg than in the 40-mg group, but theoverall incidence was considered to be unacceptably high. 36Lipoatrophy and peripheral neuropathy are more likely to occur with higher doses but the risk of lactic acidosis is associated with female gender and ahigh BMI. 33Efficacy data are limited comparing the 30-mg and 40-mg doses given twice daily, but incidence of lipoatrophy and peripheral neuropathy are reduced when the lower doses are used. Current pediatric dosing recommendations are based on early pharmacokinetic (PK) studies designed toachieve exposure (area under the curve) in children similar to that found in adults receiving a dose withproven efficacy. 37These early studies were conducted at a time when treatment options were limited and many children had failure to thrive. The authors in this early PK study state that stavudine distributes in total body water and because total body weight correlates well with lean body mass (or weight) stavudine dosages in obese children should be based on lean body weight.37 The pediatric formulation for stavudine oral solution requires refrigeration and has limited stability once reconstituted. As an alternative dosing method for children, capsules can be opened and dispersed in asmall amount of water, the appropriate dose drawn up into an oral syringe, and administered immediately. Because plasma exposure is equivalent with stavudine administered in an intact or a dispersed capsule, dosing with the dispersal method can be used as an alternative to the oral solution. 38 Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-24References 1.

Mix oral powder in 2-4 oz of soft food that does not require chewing (e.g., applesauce,yogurt). Administer immediately after mixing toavoid the bitter taste. Do not try to mix the oral powder with liquid: the powder may float on the top even aftervigorous stirring. TDF can be administered without regard to food, although absorption is enhanced whenadministered with a high-fat meal. BecauseAtripla also contains EFV, the combinationtablet should be administered on an emptystomach. Given the potential for TDF-induced changes in renal tubular function, some panel membersrecommend monitoring for proteinuria andglycosuria every 6-12 months.Dosing Recommendations Neonate/infant FDA approved or recommended for use inneonates/infants aged <2 years.

Stribild should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-30Drug Interactions (see also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents ): Renal elimination: Drugs that decrease renal function or compete for active tubular secretion could reduce clearance of tenofovir are increased when the drug is co-administered with tenofovir and this combination should be avoided if possible because of increase in didanosine toxicity. Protease inhibitors (PIs): Tenofovir decreases atazanavir plasma concentrations. adults, recommended dosing for atazanavir co-administered with tenofovir is atazanavir 300 mg withritonavir 100 mg and tenofovir 300 mg, all as a single daily dose with food. Atazanavir withoutritonavir should not be co-administered with tenofovir. In and lopinavir/ritonavirincrease tenofovir concentrations and could potentiate tenofovir-associated toxicity. Use with Stribild: If using Stribild, please see the elvitegravir section of the drug appendix for additional information. Major Toxicities: More common: Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and flatulence. Less common (more severe): Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported. Tenofovir caused bone toxicity (osteomalacia and reduced bone density) in animals when given in high doses. Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) have been reportedin both adults and children taking tenofovir; the clinical significance of these changes is not yetknown. Evidence of renal toxicity, including increases in serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen,glycosuria, proteinuria, phosphaturia, and/or calciuria and decreases in serum phosphate, has beenobserved. Numerous case reports of renal tubular dysfunction have been reported in patientsreceiving tenofovir; patients at increased risk of renal dysfunction should be closely monitored. Resistance: The International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (seehttp://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/TDF.html ). Pediatric Use: Tenofovir is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for use in children aged 2 years when used as a component of the two-NRTI backbone in combination antiretroviral therapy(cART). The standard adult dose of tenofovir approved by the FDA for adults and children aged 12 years and weight 35 kg is 300 mg once daily; for children aged 2 to 12 years, the FDA-approved dose is 8mg/kg/dose administered once daily, which closely approximates the dose of 208 mg/m 2/dose used in early studies in children.1 In adults, the recommended dose is highly effective.2, 3 In children aged 12 to <18 years, no difference in viral load response was seen between 2 treatmentgroups in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of tenofovir 300 mg once daily or placebo, plus an optimized background regimen, in 87 treatment-experienced adolescents in Brazil and Panama. 4-6 Subgroup analyses suggest this lack of response was from imbalances in viral susceptibility to theoptimized background regimens.In children aged 2 to <12 years, tenofovir 8 mg/kg/ dose once daily showed non-inferiority to zidovudine- or stavurdine-containing cART over 48 weeks of randomized treatment using a snapshotanalysis (product label). This was a switch study in children aged 2 to 12 years with viral load <400copies/mL during treatment with zidovudine or stavudine as part of cART, randomized to continue theirzidovudine or stavudine (N=49) or switch to tenofovir (N=48) while continuing other components of theregimen (Gilead study 352). 4 Other pediatric studies have also shown that virologic success is related to prior treatment experience. In115 pediatric patients treated with tenofovir, viral load decreased to <50 copies/mL at 12 months in 50%of patients on first-line therapy, 39% of patients on second-line therapy, and 13% of patients on third-line or subsequent therapy. 7This cohort used a target dose of 8 mg/kg, but 18% of patients were dosed at greater than 120% of the target dose and 37% were dosed at less than 80% of the target dose. Virologic success is also related to drug exposure. In a study using a median daily dose of 208 mg/m2, 8 lower single-dose and steady-state area under the curve (AUC) were associated with inferior virologic outcome. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in children receiving an investigational 75-mg tablet formulation of tenofovir showed that a median dose of 208 mg/m2of body surface area (range 161-256 mg/m2body surface area) resulted in a median single dose AUC and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) that were 34% and 27% lower, respectively, compared with values reported in adults administered a dailydose of 300 mg. 1, 9Renal clearance of tenofovir was approximately 1.5-fold higher in children than previously reported in adults, possibly explaining the lower systemic exposure.1This lower exposure occurred even though participants were concurrently treated with ritonavir, which boosts tenofovirexposure. Lower-than-anticipated tenofovir exposure was also found in young adults (median age 23years) treated with atazanavir/ritonavir plus tenofovir. 10 Further studies are needed of tenofovir PK and clinical outcomes in children, especially when used incombinations that do not include lopinavir and/or ritonavir. Decreases in BMD have been reported in both adult and pediatric studies. Younger children (Tanner Stages1 and 2) may be at higher risk than children with more advanced development (Tanner Stage 3). 1, 11, 12In a Phase I/II study of an investigational 75-mg formulation of tenofovir in 18 heavily pretreated children andadolescents, a >6% decrease BMD measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan wasreported in 5 of 15 (33%) children evaluated at Week 48. 1Two of the 5 children who discontinued tenofovir at 48 weeks experienced partial or complete recovery of BMD by 96 weeks.13Among children with BMD decreases, the median Tanner score was 1 (range 1-3) and mean age was 10.2 years; forchildren who had no BMD decreases, the median Tanner score was 2.5 (range 1-4) and median age was 13.2 years. 8, 13In a second study of 6 patients who received the commercially available, 300 mg formulation of tenofovir, 2 pre-pubertal children experienced >6% BMD decreases. One of the 2 children experienced a 27% decrease in BMD, necessitating withdrawal of tenofovir from her cART regimen with subsequent recovery of BMD.14Loss of BMD at 48 weeks was associated with higher drug exposure.8 In the industry-sponsored study that led to FDA approval of tenofovir in adolescents aged 12 years andweight 35 kg, 6 of 33 participants (18%) in the tenofovir arm experienced a >4% decline in absolute lumbar spine BMD in 48 weeks compared with 1 of 33 participants (3%) in the placebo arm 4, 5 (http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ UCM209151.pdf ). Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-31In the Gilead switch study (352) in children aged 2 to 12 years over the 48 weeks of randomized treatment, total body BMD gain was less in the tenofovir group than in the zidovudine or stavudinegroup, but the mean rate of lumbar spine BMD gain was similar between groups. At 48 weeks allparticipants were offered tenofovir, and for the participants who were treated with the drug for 96 weeks,total body BMD z score declined by -0.338 and lumbar spine BMD z score declined by -0.012. 4 Not all studies of tenofovir in children have identified a decline in BMD.15, 16No effect of tenofovir on BMD was found in a study in pediatric patients on stable therapy with undetectable viral load who wereswitched from stavudine and PI-containing regimens to tenofovir/lamivudine/efavirenz. 17All patients in this study remained clinically stable and virologically suppressed after switching to the new regimen.18 New onset or worsening of renal impairment has been reported in adults and children receivingtenofovir and may be more common in those with higher tenofovir trough plasma concentrations. 19 Possible tenofovir -associated nephrotoxicity manifest as Fanconi syndrome, reduced creatinineclearance (CrCl), and diabetes insipidus has been reported in a child receiving tenofovir as a componentof salvage therapy including lopinavir/ritonavir and didanosine for 1 year. 20Irreversible renal failure has been reported in an adolescent treated with tenofovir without didanosine.21Renal toxicity leading to discontinuation of tenofovir was reported in 3.7% (6 of 159) of HIV-1-infected children treated withtenofovir in the Collaborative HIV Pediatric Study (CHIPS) in the United Kingdom and Ireland. 7 Increased urinary beta-2 microglobulin suggesting proximal renal tubular damage was identified in 27%(12 of 44) of children treated with tenofovir compared with 4% (2 of 48) of children not treated withtenofovir. 22An observational cohort study of 2,102 children with HIV in the United States suggested an increased risk of renal disease (increased creatinine or proteinuria) in children treated with tenofovir-containing cART. 23Prospectively evaluated renal function was reported for a cohort of 40 pediatric patients on tenofovior-containing antiretroviral regimens from 5 Spanish hospitals. The patients rangedin age from 8 to 17 years (median age 12.5 years) and had received tenofovir for 16 to 143 months(median 77 months). The following observations were made: 18 patients had declines in CrCl after atleast 6 months of therapy; 28 patients had decreases in tubular reabsorption of phosphate, whichworsened with longer time on tenofovir; and 33 patients had proteinuria, including 10 patients withproteinuria in the nephrotic range. 24However, no significant decrease in calculated glomerular filtration rate was found in 26 HIV-infected children treated with tenofovir for 5 years.25Of 89 participants who received tenofovir in Gilead study 352 (median drug exposure 104 weeks), 4 discontinued from thestudy for renal tubular dysfunction, and 3 of whom had hypophosphatemia and decrease in total body orspine BMD z score. 4 Given the potential for BMD loss in children treated with tenofovir, some experts recommend obtaining a DXA before initiation of tenofovir therapy and approximately 6 months after start of tenofovir, especially in prepubertal patients and those early in puberty (Tanner Stages 1 and 2). Despite the ease ofuse of a once-daily drug and the efficacy of tenofovir, this potential for BMD loss during the important period of rapid bone accrual in early adolescence is concerning and favors judicious use of tenofovir in this age group. The taste-masked granules that make up the oral powder give the vehicle (e.g., applesauce, yogurt) a gritty consistency. Once mixed in the vehicle, if allowed to sit too long, the taste becomes bitter. References 1. Hazra R, Balis FM, Tullio AN, 2004;48(1):124-129.

Resistance mutations were shown to be present in 29% (5 of 17) of infants born to mothers who receivedzidovudine during pregnancy. 3 Pediatric Use: Zidovudine is frequently included as a component of the NRTI backbone for antiretroviral therapy.4-20Pediatric experience with zidovudine both for treatment of HIV and for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) is extensive. Perinatal trial PACTG 076 established that zidovudine prophylaxis given during pregnancy, labor, and delivery, and to the newborn reduced risk of perinatal transmission of HIV by nearly 70%21(see the Recommendations for Use of Antiretroviral Drugs in Pregnant HIV-1-Infected Women for Maternal Health and Interventions to Reduce Perinatal HIV Transmission in the United States for further discussion on the use of zidovudine for PMTCT of HIV). Although the PACTG 076 study used azidovudine regimen of 2 mg/kg every 6 hours, data from many international studies support twice dailyoral infant dosing for prophylaxis. Zidovudine 4 mg/kg of body weight every 12 hours is nowrecommended for neonates/infants >35 weeks of gestation for prevention of or treatment(see Perinatal Guidelines ). Overall, zidovudine pharmacokinetics (PKs) in pediatric aged >3 months are similar to those inadults. Zidovudine undergoes intracellular metabolism to its mean half-life of intracellular zidovudine is considerably longer than that ofunmetabolized zidovudine in plasma (1.5 hours), once-daily studies, such as PACTG 331, demonstrate that dose adjustments are necessary for premature infants because they have reduced clearance of zidovudine compared with term newborns ofsimilar postnatal age. 5Zidovudine has good central nervous system (CNS) penetration (cerebrospinal fluid- to-plasma concentration ratio = 0.68) and has been used in children with HIV-related CNS disease.23 References 1.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-39Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-40Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-41Dosing Recommendations Neonate/infant dose: EFV is not approved for use in neonates/ infants. Pediatric dose: Children aged <3 years: No data are currently available on the appropriate EFV dosage for children aged <3 years. Children aged 3 years and body weight 10 kg: Administer EFV once daily: * The dose in mg can be dispensed in any combination of capsule strengths. Some experts recommend a dose of 367 mg/m2of body surface area (maximum dose 600 mg)because of concern for underdosing, especially atthe upper end of each weight band (see Pediatric Usefor details). Adolescent (body weight 40 kg)/adult dose: 600 mg once daily.Efavirenz (EFV, Sustiva) (Last updated November 1, 2012; last reviewed November 1, 2012) For additional information see Drugs@FDA: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm Formulations Capsules: 50 mg, 200 mg Tablets:600 With emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF): FTC 200 mg + TDF 300 mg + EFV 600 mg (Atripla) Weight (kg) EFV dose (mg)* 10 to <15 200 15 to <20 250 20 to <25 300 25 to <32.5 350 32.5 to <40 400 40 600Selected Adverse Events Rash Central nervous system (CNS) symptoms such as dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, abnormal dreams, impaired concentration,psychosis, seizures Increased transaminases False-positive with some cannabinoid and benzodiazepine tests Potentially teratogenic Lipohypertrophy, although a causal relationship has not been established and this adverse event may be less likely than with theboosted protease inhibitors. Special Instructions Administer EFV on an empty stomach, preferably at bedtime. Avoid administrationwith a high-fat meal because of potential forincreased absorption. Administer Atripla on an empty stomach. Bedtime dosing is recommended, particularly during the first 2 to 4 weeks of therapy, to improve tolerability of CNS side effects. EFV should be used with caution in female adolescents and adults with reproductivepotential because of the potential risk inhibitor).Guidelines Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-42Drug Interactions: (see also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents ): Metabolism: Mixed inducer/inhibitor of CYP3A4 enzymes; concentrations of concomitant drugs can be increased or decreased depending on the specific enzyme pathway involved. There are multiple drug interactions. Importantly, dosage adjustment or the addition of ritonavir may be necessary whenefavirenz is used in combination with atazanavir, fosamprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ormaraviroc. Before efavirenz is administered, a patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions with efavirenz. Major Toxicities: More common: Skin rash, increased transaminase levels. Central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities, such as dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, abnormal dreams, confusion, abnormal thinking, impaired concentration, amnesia, agitation, depersonalization, hallucinations, euphoria,seizures, primarily reported in adults. Rare: Prenatal efavirenz exposure has been associated with CNS congenital abnormalities in the offspring of cynomolgus monkeys. Based on these data and retrospective reports in humans of anunusual pattern of severe CNS defects in five infants after first-trimester exposure to efavirenz-containing regimens (three meningomyelocoeles and two Dandy-Walker malformations), efavirenz has been classified as Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Pregnancy Class D, which means thatthere is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on studies in humans, but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks. Because of the potential forteratogenicity, pregnancy should be avoided in women receiving efavirenz, and treatment withefavirenz should be avoided during the first trimester (the primary period of fetal organogenesis)whenever possible. Women of childbearing potential should undergo pregnancy testing beforeinitiation of efavirenz and should be counseled about the potential risk to the fetus and desirability ofAtripla Atripla should not be used in pediatric patients <40 kg where the EFV dose would be excessive. Adult dose: One tablet once daily CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 substrate. Dosing of EFV in patients with hepatic impairment : No recommendation is currently available; use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Adult dose of Atripla in patients with renal impairment : Because Atripla is a fixed-dose combination product, it should not be used inpatients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) of<50 mL/minute or in patients on dialysis. Interpatient variability in EFV exposure can be explained in part by polymorphisms inCYP450 with slower metabolizers havinghigher risk of toxicity. (See text forinformation about therapeutic drugmonitoring [TDM] for management of mild ormoderate toxicity.)avoiding pregnancy. Alternate antiretroviral (ARV) regimens that do not include efavirenz should be strongly considered in women who are planning to become pregnant or who are sexually active andnot using effective contraception (if such alternative regimens are acceptable to provider and patientand will not compromise the woman's health). Resistance: The International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistancemutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (seehttp://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/EFV .html ). Pediatric Use: Efavirenz is FDA-approved for use as part of antiretroviral therapy in children aged 3 years or older who weigh at least 10 kg. Limited pharmacokinetic (PK) data in children younger thanage 3 or who weigh less than 13 kg have shown that it is difficult to achieve target trough concentrationsin this age group, even with very high (>30 mg/kg) doses of an investigational liquid formulation. 1Thus, efavirenz is not recommended for use in children younger than age 3 years at this time, and no liquidformulation is commercially available. Additional studies are required to determine the appropriate doseof efavirenz in infants and young children. P1070 is an ongoing study collecting data on efavirenzdosing in HIV-infected and HIV/tuberculosis-co-infected children younger than age 3 years. In addition,efavirenz should be used with caution in adolescent women of childbearing age because of the potentialrisk of teratogenicity. Efavirenz metabolism is controlled by enzymes that are polymorphically expressed and result in large interpatient variability in drug exposure. CYP2B6 is the primary enyzme for efavirenz metabolism, andpediatric patients with the 516 T/T or G/T genotype have reduced metabolism and higher efavirenzlevels compared with those with the G/G genotype. 2, 3Additional variant CYP2B6 alleles and variant CYP2A6 have been found to influence efavirenz concentrations in adults.4, 5 Long-term HIV RNA suppression has been associated with maintenance of trough efavirenzconcentrations greater than 1 mcg/mL in adults. 6Early HIV RNA suppression in children has also been seen with higher drug concentrations. Higher efavirenz troughs of 1.9 mcg/mL were seen in subjects withHIV RNA levels less than or equal to 400 copies/mL versus efavirenz troughs a West African pediatric study, ANRS 12103, early reduction in viral load (by 12 weeks) was greater in children with efavirenz minimum plasma concentration (Cmin) levels greater than 1.1 mcg/mL or area under the curve (AUC) greater than 51 mcg*h/mL.8Even with the use of FDA-approved pediatric dosing, efavirenz concentrations can be suboptimal.2, 8-11Therefore, some experts recommend therapeutic drug monitoring with efavirenz and possibly use of higher doses in youngchildren, especially in select clinical situations such as virologic rebound or lack of response in an adherent patient. In one study in which the efavirenz dose was adjusted in response to measurement of the AUC, the median administered efavirenz dose was 13 mg/kg (367 mg/m 2) and the range was from 3 to 23 mg/kg (69-559 mg/m2).7A PK study in 20 children aged 10 to 16 years treated with the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir 300 mg/m2twice daily plus efavirenz 350 mg/m2once daily showed adequacy of the lopinavir trough values but suggested that the efavirenz trough was lower than PK targets. The authors therefore recommended that higher doses of efavirenz might be needed when these drugs are used together.12Therapeutic drug monitoring can be considered when using efavirenz in combinations with potentially complex drug interactions. The toxicity profile for efavirenz differs for adults and children. A side effect commonly seen in childrenis rash, which was reported in up to 40% of children compared with 27% of adults. The rash is usuallymaculopapular, pruritic, and mild to moderate in severity and rarely requires drug discontinuation. Onset Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-43is typically during the first 2 weeks of treatment.13Although severe rash and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) have been reported, they are rare. In adults, CNS symptoms have been reported in more than 50% of patients.14These symptoms usually occur early in treatment and rarely require drug discontinuation, but they can sometimes occur or persist for months. Bedtime efavirenz dosing appears to decrease theoccurrence and severity of these neuropsychiatric side effects. Ensuring that efavirenz is taken on anempty stomach also reduces the occurrence of neuropsychiatric adverse effects. In several studies, theincidence of such adverse effects was correlated with efavirenz plasma concentrations and the symptomsoccurred more frequently in patients receiving higher concentrations. 6, 15-18In patients with pre-existing psychiatric conditions, efavirenz should be used cautiously for initial therapy. Adverse CNS effectsoccurred in 14% of children receiving efavirenz in clinical studies 13and in 30% of children with efavirenz concentrations greater than 4 mcg/mL.3CNS adverse effects may be harder to detect in children because of the difficulty in assessing neurologic symptoms such as impaired concentration,sleep disturbances, or behavior disorders in these patients. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) can be considered for children with mild or moderate toxicity possibly attributable to a particular ARV agent (see Role of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring in Management of Treatment Failure ). In that situation, it is reasonable for a clinician to use therapeutic drug monitoring to determine whether the toxicity is due to an efavirenz concentration in excess of thenormal therapeutic range. 19, 20This is the only setting in which dose reduction would be considered appropriate management of drug toxicity and, even then, it should be used with caution. Efavirenz should not be used by women who desire to become pregnant or who do not use effective, consistent contraception. Efavirenz should not be used throughout the first trimester of pregnancybecause of the potential risk of teratogenicity 21(see Recommendations for Use of Antiretroviral Drugs in Pregnant HIV-1-Infected Women for Maternal Health and Interventions to Reduce Perinatal HIV Transmission in the United States22). Alternative ARV regimens that do not include efavirenz should be strongly considered for use in sexually active adolescent females because of the potential forinconsistent use of contraception and the high risk of unintended pregnancy.

Pediatric dose: Not approved for use in children aged <6 years. Studies in infants and children aged 2 months to 6 years are under way. Antiretroviral-experienced children andadolescents aged 6-18 years (and weighing atleast 16 kg): Adult dose (antiretroviral-experienced patients): 200 mg twice daily following a mealWeight in kilograms (kg)Dose 16 kg to <20 kg 100 mg twice daily 20 kg to <25 kg 125 mg twice daily25 kg to <30 kg 150 mg twice daily 30 kg 200 mg twice dailySelected Adverse Events Nausea Rash, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes organ dysfunction, includinghepatic failure. Special Instructions Always administer ETR following a meal. Area under the curve (AUC) of ETR is decreased byabout 50% when the drug is taken on an emptystomach. The type of food does not affect theexposure to ETR. ETR tablets are sensitive to moisture; store at room temperature in original container withdesiccant. Patients unable to swallow ETR tablets may disperse the tablets in liquid, as follows : Place the tablet(s) in 5 ml (1 teaspoon) of water, or atleast enough liquid to cover the medication, stirwell until the water looks milky; if desired, addmore water or alternatively orange juice or milk(patients should not place the tablets in orangejuice or milk without first adding water. The useof grapefruit juice, warm [>40\u00b0C] drinks, orcarbonated beverages should be avoided). Drinkimmediately, then rinse the glass several timeswith water, orange juice, or milk and completelyswallow the rinse each time to make sure theentire dose is consumed. Dosing of ETR in patients with hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild-to-moderatehepatic insufficiency. No dosing information isavailable for patients with severe hepaticimpairment. Dosing of ETR in patients with renal impairment: Dose adjustment is not required in Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-48Drug Interactions (see also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents ): Etravirine is associated with multiple drug interactions. Before administration, the patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions with ETR. Etravirine should not be co-administered with drugs: tipranavir/ritonavir, fosamprenavir/ritonavir, atazanavir/ritonavir, unboosted protease inhibitors. It should other non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)(nevirapine, efavirenz, or rilpivirine). Limited data in adults suggest that etravirine may reduce thetrough concentration of raltegravir, 1but no dose adjustment is currently recommended when etravirine and raltegravir are used together. Major Toxicities: More common: Nausea, diarrhea, and mild rash. Rash occurs most commonly in the first 6 weeks of therapy. Rash generally resolves after 1 to 2 weeks on continued therapy. A history of NNRTI-related rash does not appear to increase the risk of developing rash with etravirine. However, patients whohave a history of severe rash with prior NNRTI use should not receive etravirine. Less common (more severe): Peripheral neuropathy, severe rash including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) (including constitutional findings and sometimes organ dysfunctionincluding hepatic failure), and erythema multiforme have been reported. Discontinue etravirineimmediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or HSRs develop (including severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, hepatitis, eosinophilia). Clinical status including liver transaminases should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated. Delay in stopping etravirine treatment after the onset of severe rash may result in a life-threatening reaction. It is recommended that patients who have a prior history of severe rash with nevirapine or efavirenz not receive etravirine. Resistance: The International AIDS Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (seehttp://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/ETR.html ). Pediatric Use: Etravirine is FDA-approved for use in antiretroviral-experienced children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years.patients with renal impairment. Metabolism ETR is an inducer CYP3A4, 2C9, and 2C19. Multiple drug interactions (see below) .A Phase I dose-finding study involving children aged 6-17 years, with virologic suppression on a stable lopinavir/ritonavir-containing regimen compared doses of 4 mg/kg twice daily and 5.2 mg/kg twice dailyusing both the investigational 25-mg tablets and the available 100-mg formulation. 2Etravirine therapy was added for 8 days and pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling and analysis were performed. Among 17 childrengiven 4 mg/kg twice daily, the PK parameters AUC 12hand Cminwere below preset statistical targets compared with these parameters in adults. By comparison, acceptable PK were observed for participants whoreceived 5.2 mg/kg twice daily, including 12 patients aged 6 to <12 years, and 9 study participants ages 12 to17 years. The higher dose (5.2 mg/kg twice daily; [maximum 200 mg per dose]) was chosen for evaluation inthe PIANO study (TMC125-C213), a single-arm, Phase II trial evaluating the PK, safety, tolerability, andefficacy of etravirine in 101 ARV treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects aged 6 to <18years and weighing 16 kg. 3Subjects eligible for this trial were on an ARV regimen with confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA of at least 500 copies/mL and viral susceptibility to etravirine at screening. The median baselineplasma HIV-1 RNA was 3.9 log 10copies/mL, and the median baseline CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4 cell) count was 385 x 106cells per mm3. At Week 24, 67% of these pediatric subjects had plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations <400 copies/mL and 52% had <50 copies/mL. The mean CD4 cell count increase frombaseline was 112 x 10 6cells per mm3. The population PK data from this Phase II trial (101 treatment- experienced children aged 6-17 years) revealed slightly lower etravirine exposures in adolescents (aged12-17 years) compared with children aged 6 to 11 years and with adults (see table below). The frequency, type, and severity of adverse drug reactions in pediatric subjects were comparable to thoseobserved in adult subjects, except for rash, which was observed more frequently in pediatric subjects. Themost common adverse drug reactions (in at least 2% of pediatric subjects) were rash and diarrhea. Rash(Grade 2) occurred in 15% of pediatric subjects. In the majority of cases, rash was mild to moderate, ofmacular/papular type, and occurred in the second week of therapy. Rash was self-limiting and generallyresolved within 1 week on continued therapy. The discontinuation rate for rash was 4%. Rash including serious (Grade 3 or 4) events and discontinuations were more frequently observed in female subjects compared with male subjects. The safety, efficacy, and tolerability of etravirine in treatment-experienced patients was also evaluted in a multicenter retrospective study of 23 multidrug-resistant pediatric patients with a median age of 14.2 years (interquartile range 12.5 to 15.8 years).4The median baseline HIV-1 RNA was 4.5 log10HIV-1 RNA copies/mL and the median CD4 T-cell count was 445 cells/mm3. The backbone regimen included at least two fully active drugs in 91% of patients. During a median of 48.4 weeks of follow-up, 20 patients (87%) achieved HIV-1 RNA<400 copies/mL and 18 of 23 (78%) achieved HIV-1 RNA<50 copies/mL. No patientsshowed complete resistance to etravirine after follow up but 3 of the 21 patients who interrupted etravirine treatment because of virological or immunological failure had single resistance mutations at baseline.

However, in a multi-center retrospective study involving genotypic resistance data from120 children at 8 pediatric centers in Thailand, Puthanakit et al found that 98% of the children had at leastone NNRTI resistance mutation, and 48% had etravirine mutation-weighted scores 4. 5 Etravirine is often combined with ritonavir-boosted darunavir for treatment of HIV-infected adults withprior virologic failure. King et al 6examined PK data from 37 pediatric patients receiving this combination, all receiving the maximum 200 mg etravirine dose. For both drugs, the estimated 90% confidence intervalsfor AUC and C minfell below targeted lower limits defined using data from studies in adults. While this combination has been effective in a small cohort of HIV-infected adolescents,7these data suggest a need for continued study of PK interactions involving etravirine and other ARV agents in pediatric patients.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-50Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-51Nevirapine (NVP, Viramune) (Last updated November 1, 2012; last reviewed November 1, 2012) For additional information see Drugs@FDA: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm Formulations Tablets:200 mg, extended-release 400 Recommendations Neonate/infant dose (aged <14 days): When used for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV see Perinatal Guidelines . Treatment dose not defined for infants aged 14 days. Pediatric dose (aged 15 days):See note below about initiation of therapy . Aged <8 years: 200 mg/m2of body surface area/dose (maximum dose 200 mg) twice daily Aged 8 years: 120-150 mg/m2of body surface area/dose (maximum dose 200 mg) twice daily When adjusting the dose for a growing child, the mg dose need not be decreased as thechild reaches age 8 years; rather, the mg doseis left static to achieve the appropriate mg/m 2 dosage as the child grows, as long as thereare no untoward effects. Note:NVP is initiated at a lower dose and increased in a stepwise fashion to allow induction ofcytochrome P45-metabolizing enzymes, whichresults in increased drug clearance. The occurrenceof rash is diminished by this stepwise increase indose. Initiate therapy with the age-appropriate doseonce daily for the first 14 days of therapy. If there isno rash or untoward effect, at 14 days of therapy,increase to the age-appropriate dose administeredtwice daily. The total daily dose should not exceed400 mg. Adolescent/adult dose: 200 mg twice dailySelected Adverse Events Rash, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome Symptomatic hepatitis, including fatal hepatic necrosis Severe systemic hypersensitivity syndrome with potential for multisystem organ involvement and shock. Special Instructions Can be given without regard to food. NVP-associated skin rash usually occurs within the first 6 weeks of therapy. If rash occursduring the initial 14-day lead-in period, do notincrease dose until rash resolves (see MajorToxicities). NVP XR tablets must be swallowed whole. They cannot be crushed, chewed, or divided. If NVP dosing is interrupted for >14 days, NVP dosing should be restarted with once-dailydosing for 14 days, followed by escalation to thefull, twice-daily regimen (see text below). Most cases of NVP-associated hepatic toxicity occur during the first 12 weeks of therapy;frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring,including liver function tests, is importantduring this period. However, about one-third ofcases occurred after 12 weeks of treatment, socontinued periodic monitoring of liver functiontests is needed. In some cases, patientspresented with nonspecific prodromal signs orsymptoms of hepatitis and rapidly progressedto hepatic failure. Patients with symptoms orsigns of hepatitis should have liver functiontests performed. NVP should be permanentlydiscontinued and not restarted in patients whodevelop clinical hepatitis or hypersensitivityreactions.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-52Drug Interactions (see also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents ): Metabolism: 3A (CYP3A) and 2B6; auto-induction of metabolism occurs in 2 to 4 weeks, with a 1.5- to 2-fold increase in clearance. Potential exists for multiple drug interactions. Mutant alleles of CYP2B6 cause increases in nevirapine serumconcentration in a similar manner but to a lesser extent than efavirenz. Altered adverse effect profilesrelated to elevated nevirapine levels have not been documented, probably because there arealternative CYP metabolic pathways for nevirapine. 1Please see efavirenz section for further details. Before administration, a patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions. Nevirapine should not be co-administered to patients receiving atazanavir (with orwithout ritonavir). Major Toxicities:Note: not single-dose nevirapine prophylaxis. More common: Skin severe and requiring hospitalization; some life-threatening, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis), fever, nausea, headache, and abnormal hepatic transaminases. Nevirapine should be permanently discontinued and not restarted inchildren or adults who develop severe rash, rash with constitutional symptoms (i.e., fever, orallesions, conjunctivitis, or blistering), or rash with elevated hepatic transaminases. Nevirapine- associated skin rash usually occurs within the first 6 weeks of therapy. If rash occurs during theinitial 14-day lead-in period, do not increase dose until rash resolves. However, the risk of Shake suspension well and store at room temperature Metabolism Metabolized by cytochrome in patients with renal failure receiving hemodialysis : An additional dose of NVP should be given following dialysis. Dosing of NVP in patients with hepatic impairment : NVP should not be administered to patients with moderate or severe hepaticimpairment.Note:Initiate therapy with 200 mg given once daily for the first 14 days. Increase to 200 mgadministered twice daily if there is no rash or otheruntoward effects. 400 mg XR once daily (not approved for use in children) Note:Initiate therapy with 200-mg immediate- release tablet given once daily for the first 14 days.Increase to 400 mg administered once daily if thereis no rash or other untoward effects. In patientsalready receiving full-dose immediate-release NVP,extended-release tablets can be used without the200-mg lead-in period. Patients must swallow NVPextended-release tablets whole. They must not bechewed, crushed, or divided. Patients must nevertake more than one form of NVP at the same time. NVP in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r): A higher dose of LPV/r may be needed. See LPV/rsection.developing nevirapine resistance with extended lead-in dosing is unknown and is a concern that must be weighed against a patient's overall ability to tolerate the regimen and the current antiviralresponse. Less common (more severe): Severe, life-threatening, and in rare cases fatal hepatotoxicity, including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, and hepatic failure (these are less common inchildren than adults). Most cases occur in the first 12 weeks of therapy and may be associated with rashor other signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reaction. Risk factors for nevirapine-related hepatictoxicity in adults include baseline elevation in serum transaminase levels, hepatitis B or C infection,female gender, and higher CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4 cell) count time of therapy >250 cells/mm 3in adult females and >400 cells/mm3in adult males). In children, recent results indicate that there is a three-fold increased risk of rash and hepatotoxicity when children initiatenevirapine with a CD4 percentage >15%. 2Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facialedema, muscle or joint aches, general malaise, and significant hepatic abnormalities. Nevirapine shouldbe permanently discontinued and not restarted in children or adults who develop symptomatic hepatitis,severe transaminase elevations, or hypersensitivity reactions. Resistance: The International AIDS Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (seehttp://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/NVP.html ). Pediatric Use: Nevirapine is U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for use in children from infancy onwards and remains a mainstay of therapy, especially in resource-limited settings. It has beenstudied in HIV-infected children in combination with nucleoside reverse transcriptase (NRTIs)or with NRTIs and a protease inhibitor (PI). 3-11 In infants and children previously exposed to single-dose nevirapine for prevention of perinatal transmission,nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) is less likely than lopinavir/ritonavir-based ART to controlvirus load. In a large randomized clinical trial, P1060, 153 children (mean age 0.7 years) previously exposedto nevirapine for perinatal prophylaxis were treated with plus the of nevirapine versus lopinavir/ritonavir. At 24 weeks post-randomization, 24% children in thezidovudine/lamivudine/nevirapine arm reached a virologic endpoint (virologic failure defined as <1 logdecrease in HIV RNA in Weeks 12-24 or HIV RNA >400 copies/mL at Week 24), compared with 7% in thezidovudine/lamivudine/lopinavir/ritonavir arm, P = 0.0009. When all primary endpoints were considered, including viral failure, death, and treatment discontinuation, the PI arm remained superior because 40% ofchildren in the nevirapine arm met a primary 22% for the lopinavir/ritonavir arm, P= 0.027. 12A comparison study of nevirapine versus lopinavir/ritonavir in children aged 6 to 36 months not previously exposed to nevirapine has reported similar results, suggesting that lopinavir/ritonavir-based therapy is superior to nevirapine-based therapy for infants, regardless of past nevirapine exposure.13 Body surface area has traditionally been used to guide nevirapine dosing in infants and young children. It isimportant to avoid under dosing of nevirapine because a single point mutation in the HIV genome mayconfer non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance to both nevirapine and efavirenz. Youngerchildren (aged 8 years) have higher apparent oral clearance than older children and require a higher dosageto achieve equivalent drug exposure compared with children aged >8 years. 8, 9Because of this, it is recommended that dosing for children aged <8 years be 200 mg/m2of body surface area per dose (maximum dose 200 mg) administered twice daily. For children aged 8 years, the recommended dose is 120 mg/m2of Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-53body surface area per dose (maximum dose 200 mg) administered twice daily. When adjusting the dose in a growing child, the milligram dosage need not be decreased (from 200 mg/m2to 120 mg/m2) as the child reaches 8 years; rather, the milligram dose is left static as long as there are no untoward effects, and the doseis allowed to achieve the appropriate mg/m 2dosage as the child grows. Some practitioners dose nevirapine at 150 mg/m2of body surface area every 12 hours (maximum 200 mg per dose) regardless of age, as recommended in the FDA-approved product label. The potential for under dosing with an increased risk of resistance has led to re-evaluation of lead-indosing in children who are naive to nevirapine therapy. Traditional dosing of nevirapine is initiated with asingle daily dose during the first 2 weeks of treatment to allow for auto-induction of the liver enzymesCYP3A and CYP2B6 (which are involved in nevirapine metabolism). Studies, largely in adult cohorts,indicated the potential for greater drug toxicity without this half-dose lead-in. 14The CHAPAS-1 Trial15 randomized 211 children to initiate with either half dose or full-dose nevirapine. Children werefollowed for a median of 92 weeks (68-116 weeks), and there was no difference in grade 3 or 4 adverseevents between the 2 groups. The full-dose nevirapine group had a statistically significant increase ingrade 2 rash, but most subjects were able to continue nevirapine therapy after a brief interruption. CD4 andvirologic endpoints were no different through 96 weeks. Additional trials are either in development or areunder way to further evaluate the potential of initiating nevirapine therapy at full dose in treatment-naivechildren. Reinitiating half-dose nevirapine for another 2 weeks in children who have interrupted therapyfor 7 days or longer has been standard practice; however, given the current understanding of nevirapineresistance, the half-life of the CYP enzymes, 16and the results of CHAPAS-1, the Panel recommends restarting nevirapine at full dose in children who interrupt therapy for 14 days or less. Extended-release nevirapine (400-mg tablets) was approved by the FDA for use in adult patients on thebasis of 2 trials: VERxVE and TRANxITION. VERxVE who received 200 mg of immediate-release nevirapine for 14 days before commencing daily dosing of nevirapineextended release or standard twice-daily dosing of immediate-release tablets. A backbone of tenofovirand emtricitabine used. TRANxITION enrolled patients already receiving full-dose immediate-release nevirapine and randomized them to receive the extended-release or remain on theircurrent nevirapine regimen. VERxVE and TRANxITION have shown equivalent efficacy, adverseeffect, and CD4 profiles through 48 and 24 weeks, respectively. 18Trials are under way on use of extended-release nevirapine in patients aged <18 years.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-55Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-56Dosing Recommendations Neonate/infant dose: Not approved for use in neonates/infants. Pediatric dose: Not approved for use in children. A clinical trial in treatment-naive adolescents (aged 12-18 years) is under way. Adolescent ( >18 years of age)/adult dose (antiretroviral [ARV]-naive patients only): 25 mg once dailySelected Adverse Events Depression, mood changes Insomnia Headache Rash Special Instructions Instruct patients to take rilpivirine with a meal of at least 500 calories (a protein drink alone does not constitute a meal). Do not use rilpivirine with other non- nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Do not use rilpivirine with proton pump inhibitors. Use rilpivirine with caution when co- administered with a drug with a known risk oftorsade de pointes ( http://www.qtdrugs.org/ ). Use rilpivirine with caution in patients with HIV RNA >100,000 copies/mL because ofincreased risk 3A substrate Dosing in patients with hepatic impairment : No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Dosing in patients with renal impairment : No dose adjustment is required in patientswith mild or moderate renal impairment. Use rilpivirine with caution in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renaldisease. Increase monitoring for adverseeffects because rilpivirine concentrations maybe increased in patients with severe renalimpairment or end-stage renal disease.Rilpivirine (RPV, Edurant, TMC 278) (Last updated November 1, 2012; last reviewed November 1, 2012) For additional information see Drugs@FDA: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm Formulations Tablet:25 disoproxil (TDF):RPV 25 + FTC 200 mg + TDF 300 mg (Complera)Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-57Drug Interactions: Metabolism: Rilpivirine is a CYP 3A substrate and requires dosage adjustments when administered with CYP 3A-modulating medications. Before rilpivirine is administered, a patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions. Major Toxicities:More common: Insomnia, headache, and rash. Less common (more severe): Depression or mood changes. Resistance: The International AIDS Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mu- tations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ). Pediatric Use: The pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of rilpivirine in pediatric patients have not been established. An international trial currently under way is investigating a 25-mg dose of rilpivirine in com- bination with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in antiretroviral-naive children aged 12 to 18years who weigh at least 40 kg.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-58Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-59Atazanavir (ATV, Reyataz) (Last updated November 1, 2012; last reviewed November 1, 2012) For additional information see Drugs@FDA: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm Formulations Capsules:100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg, and 300 mg Selected Adverse Events Indirect hyperbilirubinemia Prolonged electrocardiogram PR interval, first-degree symptomatic atrioventricular (AV) block in some patients Hyperglycemia Fat maldistribution Possible increased bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia Nephrolithiasis Skin rash Increased serum transaminases Hyperlipidemia (primarily with RTV boosting) Special Instructions Administer ATV with food to enhance absorption. Additional patient education should be considered to avoid dosing errors when prescribing ATV 250 mg because this doserequires 2 different capsule strengths of ATV. Because ATV can prolong the electrocardiogram (ECG) PR interval, use ATVwith caution in patients with pre-existingcardiac conduction system disease or withother drugs known to prolong the PR interval(e.g., calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, digoxin, verapamil). ATV absorption is dependent on low gastric pH; therefore, when ATV is administered withmedications that alter gastric pH, specialdosing information is indicated (see Drug Interactions for recommendations on dosing ATV when the drug is co-administered withH2 receptor antagonists). When administeredwith buffered didanosine (ddI) formulations orantacids, give ATV at least 2 hours before or 1hour after antacid or ddI administration.Dosing Recommendations Neonate/infant dose: Not approved for use in neonates/infants. ATV should not be administered to neonatesbecause of risks associated withhyperbilirubinemia (kernicterus). Pediatric dose: Data are insufficient to recommend dosing in children aged <6 years. For children aged 6 to <18 years: * Dose in mg requires two different capsule strengths of ATV. Additional patient education should beconsidered to avoid dosing errors (see text fordiscussion). For treatment-naive pediatric patients who do not tolerate ritonavir (RTV): ATV boosted with RTV (ATV/r) is preferred for children andadolescents. Current Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved prescribinginformation does not recommend unboostedATV in children aged <13 years. If unboostedATV is used in adolescents, higher doses thanthose used in adults may be required toachieve target drug levels (see Pediatric Use ). Only RTV-boosted ATV should be used in combination with TDF because TDF decreasesATV exposure.Weight (kg) Once-Daily Dose 15-<20 kg ATV 150 mg + RTV 100 mg, both once daily with food 20-<32 kg ATV 200 mg + RTV 100 mg, both once daily with food 32-<40 kg ATV 250 mg* + RTV 100 mg, both once daily with food 40 kg ATV 300 mg + RTV 100 mg, both once daily with foodGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-60 The plasma concentration, and therefore therapeutic effect, of ATV can be expected to decrease substantially when ATV is co-administered with proton-pump inhibitors(PPIs). Antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naivepatients receiving PPIs should receive no morethan a 20-mg dose equivalent of omeprazole,which should be taken approximately 12 hoursbefore boosted ATV. Co-administration of ATVwith PPIs is not recommended in treatment-experienced patients. Patients with hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infections and patients with markedelevations in transaminases before treatmentmay be at increased risk of further elevationsin transaminases or hepatic decompensation. Metabolism ATV is a substrate inhibitor of cytochrome P (CYP) of ATV in patients with hepatic impairment: ATV should be used with caution in patients with mild-to-moderate hepaticimpairment; consult manufacturer'sprescribing information for dosageadjustment in patients with moderateimpairment. ATV should not be used inpatients with severe hepatic impairment. Dosing of ATV in patients with renal impairment: No dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment. However,ATV should not be given to treatment-experienced patients 300 mg + RTV 100 mg or ATV 400 mg once daily with food (if unboosted ATV is usedin adolescents, higher doses than those usedin adults may be required to achieve targetdrug levels [see Pediatric Use ]). Antiretroviral-experienced patients: ATV 300 mg + RTV 100 mg, both once daily with food. ATV in combination with efavirenz (EFV) (adults) intherapy-naive patients only: ATV 400 mg + RTV 100 mg + EFV 600 mg, all once daily at separate times. Although ATV/r should be taken with food, EFV should be taken on an empty stomach,preferably at bedtime. EFV should not be usedwith ATV (with or without RTV) in treatment-experienced patients because EFV decreasesATV exposure. ATV in combination with tenofovir (TDF) (adults): ATV 300 mg + RTV 100 mg + TDF 300 mg, all once daily with food. Only RTV-boosted ATV should be used in combination with TDF because TDF decreasesATV exposure. Drug Interactions (see also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents ): Metabolism: Atazanavir is both a substrate and an inhibitor of the cytochrome P (CYP) 3A4 enzyme system and has significant interactions with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A4 for metabolism. Atazanavir also competitively inhibits CYP1A2 and CYP2C9. There is potential for multiple CYP2C8. A patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions with atazanavir before the drug is administered.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-61Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs): Tenofovir decreases atazanavir plasma concentrations. Only ritonavir-boosted atazanavir should inhibitors: concentrations significantly. Nevirapine and etravirine should not be co- administered to patients receiving atazanavir (with or without ritonavir). Efavirenz should not beco-administered with atazanavir in treatment-experienced patients but may be used in combinationwith atazanavir 400 mg plus ritonavir boosting in Inhibitors: Atazanavir is an inhibitor of UGT1A1 and may increase plasma concentrations of raltegravir. This interaction may not be clinically significant. Absorption: Atazanavir absorption is dependent on low gastric pH. When atazanavir is administered with medications that alter gastric pH, dosage adjustment is indicated. No information is available ondosing atazanavir in children when the drug is co-administered with medications that alter gastric pH. Guidelines for dosing atazanavir with antacids, H2 receptor antagonists, and proton-pump inhibitors(PPIs) in adults are as follows: Antacids: Atazanavir concentrations are decreased when the drug is with antacids and buffered medications (including buffered didanosine formulations); therefore, atazanavir should be administered 2 hours before or 1 hour after these medications. H2-Receptor Antagonists (unboosted atazanavir in treatment-naive patients): H2 receptorantagonists are expected to decrease atazanavir concentrations by interfering with absorption of theantiretroviral (ARV) agent. Atazanavir 400 mg should be administered at least 2 hours before or atleast 10 hours after a dose of the H2 receptor antagonist (a single dose of an H2 receptor antagonistshould not exceed a dose comparable to famotidine 20 mg; a total daily dose should not exceed adose comparable to famotidine 40 mg). H2-Receptor Antagonists (boosted atazanavir in treatment-naive or -experienced patients): H2 receptor antagonists are expected to decrease atazanavir concentrations by interfering with absorption of theARV . Dose recommendations for H2 receptor antagonists are either a 40-mg dose equivalent offamotidine twice daily for treatment-naive patients or a 20-mg dose equivalent of famotidine twicedaily for treatment-experienced patients. Boosted atazanavir (ATV 300 mg + RTV 100 mg) should beadministered simultaneously with and/or 10 hours after the dose of H2 receptor antagonist. H2-Receptor Antagonists (boosted atazanavir with tenofovir): Treatment-experienced patients using both tenofovir and H2-receptor antagonists should be given an increased dose of atazanavir (ATV400 mg + RTV 100 mg + TDF 300 mg). PPIs: Coadministration of PPIs with atazanavir is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir plasma concentrations and decrease its therapeutic effect. Dose recommendations for therapy-naive patients are 20-mg dose equivalent of omeprazole taken approximately 12 hours before boosted atazanavir (ATV 300 mg + RTV 100 mg). Coadministration of atazanavir with PPIs is notrecommended in treatment experienced patients. Major Toxicities: More common: Indirect hyperbilirubinemia that can result in jaundice or icterus, but is not a marker of hepatic toxicity. Headache, fever, arthralgia, depression, insomnia, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and paresthesias. Less common: Prolongation of PR interval of electrocardiogram. Abnormalities in atrioventricular (A V) conduction generally limited to first-degree A V block, but with rare reports of second-degreeA V block. Rash, generally mild to moderate, but in rare cases includes life-threatening Stevens- Johnson syndrome. Fat maldistribution and lipid abnormalities may be less common than with otherprotease inhibitors (PIs). However, the addition of ritonavir to atazanavir is associated with lipidabnormalities but to a lesser extent than with other boosted PIs. Rare: New onset diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes mellitus, hemophiliacs, and elevation in serum transaminases.Nephrolithiasis. Hepatotoxicity (patients with hepatitis B or hepatitis C are at increased risk). Resistance: The International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistancemutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (seehttp://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/ATV .html ). Pediatric Use: Atazanavir is FDA-approved for use in children and adolescents. Ritonavir-boosted atazanavir is generally preferred over unboosted atazanavir and is used in combination with NRTIs fortreatment in children aged 6 years. The results of the IMPAACT/PACTG 1020A trial in children and adolescents indicate that, in the absence ofritonavir boosting, atazanavir can achieve protocol-defined pharmacokinetic (PK) targets, but only whenused at higher doses of atazanavir (on a mg/kg body weight or mg/m 2body surface area basis) than doses currently recommended in adults. In IMPAACT/PACTG 1020A, children older than 6 and younger than 13 years of age required atazanavir dosing of 520 mg/m 2of body surface area per day of atazanavir capsule formulation to achieve PK targets. Doses required for older adolescents were greater than the adult approveddose of 400 mg atazanavir given without ritonavir boosting once daily: adolescents aged >13 years requiredatazanavir dosing of 620 mg/m 2of body surface area per day.1In this study, the areas under the curve (AUCs) for the unboosted arms were similar to the ritonavir-boosted atazanavir groups but the maximumplasma concentration (C max) was higher and minimum plasma concentration (Cmin) lower for the unboosted arms. Median doses of atazanavir in mg/m2both with and without ritonavir boosting from IMPAACT/ PACTG 1020A are outlined in the following table. When dosing unboosted atazanavir in pediatric patients,therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is recommended to ensure that adequate atazanavir plasmaconcentrations have been achieved. A minimum target trough concentration for atazanavir is 150 ng/mL. 2 Higher target trough concentrations may be required in protease inhibitor (PI)-experienced patients. Summary of Atazanavir Dosing IMPAACT/PACTG 1020A1 * Dose satisfied protocol-defined AUC/PK parameters and met all acceptable safety targets. These doses differ from those recommended by the manufacturer. TDM was used to determine patient-specific dosing in this trial. Regarding toxicity, 8.5% (11 of 129) of patients enrolled in the trial had a bilirubin >5 times the upper limit of normal. Asymptomatic electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities were observed in a small number of patients: Grade 3 QTC prolongation in 1 patient, Grade 2 PR or HR changes in 9 patients,and Grade 3 PR prolongations in 3 patients.

The modeling used in the study does not assume 100% treatmentadherence and has been shown to perform better than conventional modeling. 5The authors acknowledge that atazanavir/ritonavir at 250/100 mg appeared to be a more appropriate dose than atazanavir/ritonavir at200/100 mg for the 35 to <40 kg weight group; however, this dose was not recommended in the productlabel because the 250 atazanavir dosage strength requires the use of 2 different capsule strengths and isprone to dosing errors. 5 The doses of atazanavir/ritonavir recommended by the Pediatric ARV Guideline Panel are 200/100 mg forpediatric patients weighing 20 to <32 kg and 250/100 mg for patients weighing 32 to <40 kg while theFDA-approved dose of atazanavir/ritonavir is 200/100 mg for pediatric patients weighing 20 to <40 kg.The higher dose of 250/100 mg is recommended by the Pediatric ARV Guideline Panel at the 32 to <40 kgweight band to avoid underdosing. Additional patient education to prevent dosing errors is recommendedwhen 250 mg of atazanavir is prescribed because this dosage requires the use of 2 different capsulestrengths of atazanavir. A population PK study of 51 children with mean age 14.3 years and weight 51 kg that targeted meanadult exposure for a 300/100 mg atazanavir/ritonavir dosage showed that the following atazanavir/ritonavir doses might be an appropriate alternative to the FDA recommendations: 200/100 (25-39 kg),250/100 mg (39-50 kg) and 300/100 (>50 kg). 6In addition, simulations suggested that the following doses should be used in children when combined with 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF):250/100 mg for children weighing 35 to 39 kg, then 300/100 mg for children weighing over 39 kg. 6The authors conclude that these recommendations should be prospectively confirmed.6 In a small, single-site study, 23 pediatric patients (median age 16 years) on combination antiretroviraltherapy were switched to a once-daily ritonavir-boosted atazanavir-containing regimen because ofvirologic failure (12 patients) or for treatment simplification (11 patients). 7Twenty of the patients had previously received PI-based regimens with the median number of two atazanavir-associated mutationsacquired before switching to atazanavir/ritonavir. Patients received atazanavir doses lower than thosecurrently recommended and many patients received concomitant therapy with tenofovir and/ordidanosine. Both tenofovir and buffered didanosine have known drug interactions with atazanavir andcan lower plasma concentrations. In this study, atazanavir plasma concentrations were measured at 12 to15 hours after dosing: 6 patients had undetectable levels at multiple time points, and considerable interpatient variability in plasma atazanavir concentrations was noted. Four of the 13 patients who previously had undetectable viral loads experienced virologic failure; 6 of 12 patients who previously had virologic failure achieved undetectable viral loads.

Drug exposure is not significantly alteredby the calorie and fat content of the meal. DRV contains a sulfonamide moiety. The potential for cross sensitivity between DRV andother drugs in the sulfonamide class isunknown. Use DRV with caution in patientswith known sulfonamide allergy. Pediatric dosing requires administration of multiple 75-mg or 150-mg tablets to achievethe recommended doses of 375 mg or 450 mgdepending on weight band. Careful instructionto caregivers is important. Pill burden mayhave a negative effect on adherence. Store DRV tablets and oral suspension at room temperature (25\u00baC or 77\u00baF). Oral suspensionshould be stored in the original container andshaken well before dosing. Do not use once daily for: children aged <12 years; for youth ages 12-18 years if treatmentexperienced (prior treatment failure); or inDosing Recommendations should not be used without ritonavir (RTV). Neonate/infant dose: Not approved for use in neonates/infants.

Ritonavir inhibits CYP3A4, thereby increasing the plasma concentration of darunavir. Potential exists for multiple drug interactions. Before administration, a patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions. Major Toxicities: More common: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, and fatigue. Less common: Skin rash, including erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Fever and elevated hepatic Rare: New onset diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes mellitus, and spontaneous bleeding in hemophiliacs. Hepatic dysfunction, particularly in patients with underlying risk factors (such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus co-infection, or thosewith baseline elevation in transaminases). Resistance: The International AIDS Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (seehttp://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/DRV .html ).(DRV 800 mg + RTV 100 mg can be used in treatment- naive pediatric patients aged 12-18 years and weighing 40 kg but is not FDA-approved for this population (see text).

Dosing in patients with renal impairment : No dose adjustment is required in patients withmoderate renal impairment (creatinineclearance [CrCl] 30-60 mL/min). There are nopharmacokinetic in patients with severerenal impairment or end-stage renal disease.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-67Pediatric Use: Darunavir boosted with ritonavir is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for use twice daily in combination with ritonavir in children aged 3 years and older as part of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), but is not FDA-approved for once-daily use in those younger than age 18years. Using darunavir tablets and ritonavir liquid or tablets, initial pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluationwas based upon a randomized, open-label, multicenter study that enrolled 80 treatment-experiencedpediatric participants ages 6 to <18 years and weighing 20 kg. The participants had a median age of 14years (range 6-<18 years) and 71% were male, 54% were white, 30% black, 9% Hispanic, and 8% otherrace/ethnicity. Patients were stratified according to their weight and received darunavir/ritonavir plusbackground therapy consisting of at least two non-protease inhibitor antiretroviral (ARV) drugs. 1The study was a two-part Phase II trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and tolerance of darunavir/ritonavir inchildren. In Part I, a weight-adjusted dose of darunavir 9 to 15 mg/kg and ritonavir 1.5 to 2.5 mg/kg twicedaily, equivalent to the standard adult dose of darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily, resulted ininadequate drug exposure in the pediatric population studied with 24-hour area under the curve (AUC 24h) of 81% and pre-dose concentration (C0h) of 91% of the corresponding adult pharmacokinetic parameters. A pediatric dose 20% to 33% higher than the directly scaled adult dose was needed to achieve drugexposure similar to that found in adults and was the dose selected for Part II of the study. The higher doseused for the safety and efficacy evaluation was darunavir 11 to 19 mg/kg and ritonavir 1.5 to 2.5 mg/kgtwice daily. This the PK values in adults. Patients werestratified by body weight: 20 to <30 kg and 30 to <40 kg. Doses were all given twice daily and wereadjusted when patients changed weight categories. After the 2-week PK evaluation, all patients wereallowed to switch to ritonavir 100-mg capsules, if desired, to avoid use of liquid oral ritonavir. Based on the findings in the safety and efficacy portion of the study, weight-band doses of darunavir/ritonavir were chosen as follows: 375/50 mg twice daily for body weight 20 to <30 kg, 450/60 mg twicedaily for 30 to <40 kg, and 600/100 mg twice daily for 40 kg. As reported in the FDA clinical review(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ ucm129560.pdf ), for the 80 participants the Week 24 viral load was <400 copies/mL and <50 copies/mL in 66% and 51% respectively2(FDA snapshot analysis), and only 1 participant withdrew for an adverse event. In this study, 27 of the 80 participants1switched from the ritonavir liquid solution to ritonavir 100-mg capsules, which are much easier to tolerate for children who can swallow pills. A separate study in 19 Thaichildren 3used ritonavir 100 mg twice daily as the boosting ritonavir dose, with darunavir doses of 375 mg (body weight 20 to <30 kg), 450 mg (body weight 30 to 40 kg), and 600 mg twice daily (body weight 40kg). The darunavir exposures of twice-daily darunavir doses boosted with 100 mg ritonavir twice daily showed values similar to those obtained with lower ritonavir doses. This regimen was well tolerated and adds further support to boosting with the easier to tolerate 100-mg capsule of ritonavir twice daily even in children as young as aged 6 years or weighing as little as 20 kg. Data are not available to evaluate the safety and tolerability of using ritonavir 100 mg in children who weigh less than 20 kg. Darunavir oral suspension administered twice daily with ritonavir boosting has been studied in childrenaged 3 to <6 years and weighing 10 to <20 kg, reported in, 4and in an FDA Clinical review.2, 5This trial was in N = 27 children ages 3 to <6 years who were failing their current antiretroviral therapy regimens and had fewer than 3 darunavir resistance-associated mutations on genotype testing. Participants wereenrolled from Argentina, Brazil, India, Kenya, and South Africa. The initial dose for study was darunavir20 mg/kg with ritonavir 3 mg/kg, both given twice daily, but higher-than-anticipated doses were required to achieve target drug exposures. Therefore, the dose used in these studies in this age and weight groupwas increased to darunavir 25 mg/kg body weight combined with ritonavir 3 mg/kg body weight for children between 10 and 15 kg, and darunavir 375 mg plus ritonavir 50 mg for children 15 to <20 kgbody weight. After dose adjustment, the darunavir AUC (0-12h), measured as a percent of the adultvalue, was 128% overall, 140% in the 10 to <15 kg weight band, and 122% in participants who weighed15 to <20 kg (page 44 in http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/ DevelopmentResources/UCM287674.pdf ). At study week 24, 16 of 27 (59%) of these treatment- experienced subjects aged 3 to 6 years had viral load <50 copies/mL. This compares to a 75% virologicsuccess rate in the 6- to 12-year-olds, and 39% in subjects aged 12 to 18 years (virologic success definedas viral load <50 copies/mL at 24 weeks) (http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DevelopmentApproval Process/DevelopmentResources/UCM287673.pdf ). Diarrhea, vomiting, and rash were the most common side effects. The taste of the darunavir liquid is said to be better than the poor taste of the ritonavirneeded for PK boosting, which is seen as a greater challenge to palatability. When the study was completed, re-analysis of the PK data suggested that a dose of darunavir 20 mg/kg plus RTV 3 mg/kg body weight would be acceptable (table), and that re-analysis led to the final dosingrecommendations found in the FDA product label.

Pediatric specific: In clinical trials of fosamprenavir, vomiting was more frequent in children than in adults (20%-60% vs. 10%-16%, respectively) as was neutropenia Resistance: The International AIDS Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (seehttp://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/APV_FPV .html ). Pediatric Use: Fosamprenavir is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for use in children as young as age 4 weeks, but the Panel recommends use only for children aged 6 months or older. Whileunboosted fosamprenavir has been approved by the FDA for antiretroviral-naive children aged 2 to 5years, the Panel does not recommend unboosted fosamprenavir for this or any other age group becauseof low exposures and because unboosted fosamprenavir may select for mutations associated withresistance to darunavir. 2 Dosing recommendations for fosamprenavir are based on 3 pediatric studies that enrolled over 200children aged 4 weeks to 18 years. In 2 open-label trials in both treatment-experienced and treatment-naive children from ages 2 to 18 years; 3, 4fosamprenavir was well-tolerated and effective in suppressing viral load and increasing CD4 T lymphocyte count. However, data were insufficient to support a once-daily dosing regimen of ritonavir-boosted fosamprenavir in children; therefore, once-daily dosing is notrecommended for pediatric patients. In a study of infants, higher doses of both fosamprenavir and ritonavir were used in treatment-naive infants as young as age 4 weeks and in treatment-experienced infants as young as age 6 months. 1 Exposures in those younger than age 6 months were much lower than those achieved in older childrenand adults and comparable to those seen with unboosted fosamprenavir. Given these low exposures,limited data, large volumes, unpleasant taste, and the availability of alternatives for infants and youngchildren, the panel does not recommend fosamprenavir use in infants younger than 6 months.

Should not be administered to neonates because of the risks associated with hyperbilirubinemia (kernicterus). Pediatric dose: Not approved for use in children. A range of IDV doses (234-500 mg/m2of body surface area) boosted by low-dose (RTV) have been studied in children(see text). Adolescent/adult dose: 800 mg IDV + 100 or 200 mg RTV every 12 hoursSelected Adverse Events Nephrolithiasis Gastrointestinal intolerance, nausea Hepatitis Indirect hyperbilirubinemia Hyperlipidemia Headache, asthenia, blurred vision, dizziness, rash, metallic taste, thrombocytopenia, alopecia, and hemolytic anemia Hyperglycemia Fat maldistribution Possible increased bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia Special Instructions When given in combination with RTV, meal restrictions are not necessary. Adequate hydration is required to minimize risk of nephrolithiasis ( 48 oz of fluid daily in adult patients). If co-administered with didanosine (ddI), give IDV and ddI 1 hour apart on an empty stomach. IDV capsules are sensitive to moisture; store at room temperature (59-86\u00baF) in original container with Metabolism Cytochrome P450 inhibitor and substrate Dosing in patients with hepatic impairment : Decreased dosage should be used in patientswith mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment(recommended dose for adults is 600 mg IDVevery 8 hours).

There is potential for multiple drug interactions. Avoid other drugs that cause hyperbilirubinemia, such as atazanavir. Before administration, a patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions with indinavir. Major Toxicities:More common: Nausea, abdominal pain, headache, metallic taste, dizziness, asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia (10%), lipid abnormalities, pruritis, and rash. Nephrolithiasis/urolithiasis with deposits. Less bleeding in hemophiliacs, acute hemolytic anemia, and hepatitis (life-threatening in rare cases). Pediatric specific: The cumulative frequency of nephrolithiasis is higher in children (29%) than in adults (12.4%). Resistance: The International AIDS Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (seehttp://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/IDV .html ). Pediatric Use: Indinavir has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the pediatric population. Although indinavir was one of the first protease inhibitors to be studied in children,its use in pediatrics has never been common and is currently very rare. 1 Both unboosted and ritonavir-boosted indinavir have been studied in HIV-infected children. Data inchildren indicate that an unboosted indinavir dose of 500 to 600 mg/m 2of body surface area given every 8 hours results in peak blood concentrations and area under the curve slightly higher than those in adultsbut considerably lower trough concentrations. A significant proportion of children have trough indinavirconcentrations less than the 0.1 mg/L value associated with virologic efficacy in adults. 2-5Studies in small groups of children of a range of ritonavir-boosted indinavir doses have shown that indinavir 500 mg/m2 of body surface area plus ritonavir 100 mg/m2of body surface area twice daily is probably too high,6that indinavir 234 to 250 mg/m2of body surface area plus low-dose ritonavir twice daily is too low,7, 8and that indinavir 400 mg/m2of body surface area plus ritonavir 100 to 125 mg/m2of body surface area twice daily results in exposures approximating those seen with 800 mg indinavir/100 mg ritonavir twice daily in adults, albeit with considerable interindividual variability and high rates of toxicity.8-10 As noted above, the cumulative frequency of nephrolithiasis is substantially higher in children (29%)than in adults (12.4%, range across clinical trials 4.7%-34.4%). 11This is likely due to the difficulty in maintaining adequate hydration in children. Finally, a large analysis of more than 2,000 HIV-infected children from PACTG 219 demonstrated a hazard ratio of 1.7 for risk of renal dysfunction in children receiving antiretroviral therapy with indinavir.12References 1.

These toxicities in premature infants include transient symptomatic adrenal insufficiency,1life-threatening bradyarrhthymias and cardiac dysfunction,2-4and lactic acidosis, acute renal failure, central nervous system depression, and respiratory depression.4These toxicities may be from the drug itself and/or from the inactive ingredients in the oral solution, including propylene glycol 15.3%, and ethanol42.4%. 4Transient asymptomatic elevation in 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels has been reported in term newborns treated at birth with lopinavir/ritonavir.1 Resistance: The International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (seehttp://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/LPV .html ). Pediatric Use: Lopinavir/ritonavir is FDA-approved for children. Ritonavir acts as a pharmacokinetic (PK) enhancer by inhibiting the metabolism of lopinavir and thereby increasing the plasma concentration oflopinavir. There is some controversy about the dosing of lopinavir/ritonavir in children. Children have lower drugexposure than adults when treated with doses that are directly scaled for body surface area. The directlyscaled dose approximation of the adult dose in children is calculated by dividing the adult dose by the usualadult body surface area of 1.73 m 2. For the adult dose of 400/100 mg lopinavir/ritonavir, the appropriate pediatric dose would be approximately 230/57.5 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per m2. However, younger children have enhanced lopinavir clearance and need higher drug doses to achieve drug exposures similar to those inadults treated with standard doses. To achieve similar C trough to that observed in adults, the pediatric dose needs to be increased 30% over the dose that is directly scaled for body surface area. A PK study in 12 children aged 6 months to 12 years receiving 230 mg/57.5 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per m2 of body surface area per dose twice daily (without nevirapine), the mean Ctrough was 4.74 \u00b1 2.93 mcg/mL (about of the adult value of 7.1 \u00b1 2.9 mcg/mL).5For 15 children ages 6 months to 12 years treated with 300 mg/75 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per m2of body surface area per dose twice daily (without nevirapine), the mean Ctrough was 7.91 \u00b1 4.52 mcg/mL, similar to that in adults treated with 400 mg/100 mg lopinavir/ ritonavir twice daily.5In a study of 23 children (median age 5.6 years; range 0.4 to 13 years) treated with 230 mg/57.5 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per m2of body surface area per dose twice daily (without nevirapine), mean lopinavir area under the curve (AUC) and Cminwere lower than that observed in adults treated with 400/100 mg lopinavir/ritonavir twice daily.6Lopinavir Cmin<1.0 mg/L was found in 7 of 23 participants: 5 of 7 in the age group <2 years, and 2 of 16 children aged 2 years or older (P = 0.01).6Therefore, some clinicians choose to initiate therapy in children ages 6 months to 12 years using 300 mg/75 mg lopinavir/ ritonavir per m2of body surface area per dose twice daily (when given without nevirapine, efavirenz, fosamprenavir, or nelfinavir) rather than the drug label-recommended 230 mg/57.5 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per m2of body surface area per dose twice daily. The PK of the oral solution at approximately 300 mg/75 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per m2of body surface area per dose twice daily was evaluated in infants younger than age 6 weeks7and infants aged 6 weeks to 6 months.8Lopinavir exposures from these studies are compared to those in older children5and adults9as shown in the table below. Values are means; all data shown performed in the absence of non- nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-80Even at this higher dose, pre-dose (Ctrough ) levels were highly variable but were lower in infants than in children older than age 6 months and were lowest in the youngest infants aged 6 weeks or younger compared with those ages 6 weeks to 6 months. By age 12 months, lopinavir AUC was similar to thatfound in older children. 10Because infants gain weight rapidly in the first months of life, one important way to optimize lopinavir dosing is to weigh a patient and adjust the dose for growth at frequent intervals.Given the safety of doses as high as 400 mg/m 2body surface area in older children and adolescents,11some practitioners anticipate rapid infant growth and prescribe doses somewhat higher than the 300 mg/m2body surface area dose to let the infant \"grow into\" the 300 mg/m2body surface area amount. In both children and adults the lopinavir Ctrough is reduced by concurrent treatment with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors or concomitant fosamprenavir or nelfinavir and higher doses of lopinavirare recommended if the drug is given in combination with nevirapine, efavirenz, fosamprenavir, ornelfinavir. In 14 children treated with 230 mg/57.5 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per m 2of body surface area per dose twice daily plus nevirapine, the mean lopinavir Ctrough was 3.77 \u00b1 300 mg/75 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per m2of body surface area per dose twice daily, the mean Ctrough was 5.62 \u00b1 3.32 mcg/mL. Not only are these trough plasma concentrations lower than those found in adults treated with standard doses of lopinavir/ritonavir, but the variability inconcentration is much higher in children than adults. 5, 6In a study of 15 HIV-infected children treated with the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir using an increased dose of 300 mg/75 mg lopinavir/ritonavirper m 2of body surface area per dose twice daily plus efavirenz 14 mg/kg body weight per dose once daily, the median 12-hour lopinavir trough was 5.7 mcg/mL, but there was 34-fold inter-individualvariation in lopinavir trough concentrations, and 5 of 15 (33%) children had lopinavir 12-hour trough concentrations less than 1.0 mcg/mL, the plasma concentration needed to inhibit wild-type HIV . 12A PK study in 20 children aged 10 to 16 years treated with the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir 300 mg/75 mg per m2of body surface area twice daily plus efavirenz 350 mg/m2of body surface area once daily showed adequacy of the lopinavir trough values.13 Once-daily dosing of lopinavir/ritonavir 800 mg/200 mg administered as a single daily dose is FDA-approved for treatment of HIV infection in therapy-naive adults older than age 18 years. However, once-daily administration cannot be recommended for use in children in the absence of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) because of high inter-individual variability in drug exposure and trough plasma concentrations below the therapeutic range for wild-type virus in 21 (35.6%) of 59 patients. 14-17 Compared with the soft-gel formulation of lopinavir/ritonavir, the tablet formulation has lower Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-81Adults9Children5Children5Infants at 12 months10 aInfants 6 weeks- 6 months8Infants <6 weeks7 N 19 12 15 20 18 9 mg 12.5 12.1 9.4 5.2 Ctroughmcg/mL 7.1 4.7 7.9 4.9 2.7 2.5 Cminmcg/mL 5.5 3.4 6.5 3.8 2.0 1.4 a Data generated in study cited but not reported in final manuscript; data in table according to an e-mail from Edmund Capparelli, PharmD (April 18, 2012)variability in trough levels,17, 18but the Panel remains concerned about the long-term effectiveness of once-daily lopinavir/ritonavir in children. Lopinavir/ritonavir has been shown to be effective as salvage therapy in HIV-infected children with severe immune suppression,19, 20although patients with greater prior exposure to antiretrovirals may have slower reductions in virus load to undetectable concentrations20, 21and less robust response in CD4 percentage.22Twice daily doses of lopinavir used in this cohort were 230 to 300 mg/m2of body surface area in 39% of patients, 300 to 400 mg/m2of body surface area in 35%, and greater than 400 mg/m2of body surface area per dose in 4%.22 More important than viral resistance to lopinavir is the relationship of the drug exposure (trough plasmaconcentration measured just before a dose, or C trough ) to the susceptibility of the HIV-1 isolate (EC50). The ratio of Ctrough to EC50is called the inhibitory quotient (IQ), and in both adults and children treated with lopinavir/ritonavir, virus load reduction is more closely associated with IQ than with either theC trough or EC50alone.23-26A study of the practical application of the IQ to guide therapy using higher doses of lopinavir/ritonavir in children and adolescents showed the safety and tolerability of doses of400 mg/100 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per m 2of body surface area per dose twice daily (without fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, nevirapine or efavirenz) and 480 mg/120 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per m2of body surface area per dose twice daily (with nevirapine or efavirenz).11Results of a modeling study suggest that standard doses of lopinavir/ritonavir are likely to be inadequate for treatment-experiencedchildren and underscore the potential utility of TDM in children previously treated with proteaseinhibitors and now on salvage therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir. 27 Lopinavir/ritonavir tablets must be swallowed whole. Crushed tablets are slowly and erraticallyabsorbed, and result in significantly reduced AUC, C max, and Ctrough compared with swallowing the whole tablet. The variability of the reduced exposure with the crushed tablets (5% to 75% reduction inAUC) means that a dose modification cannot be relied on to overcome the reduced absorption. Crushedtablets cannot be recommended for use. 28In a PK study using a generic adult formulation of lopinavir/ ritonavir manufactured in Thailand, 21 of 54 children were administered cut (not crushed) pills and hadadequate lopinavir C trough measurements.18 Compared with children treated with NNRTI-based regimens, those treated with lopinavir/ritonavir mayhave less robust weight gain and smaller increases in CD4 percentage. 29-31The poor weight gain associated with lopinavir/ritonavir is not understood. The poor palatability of the oral solution can be a significant challenge to medication adherence for some children and families. Numbing of the taste buds with ice chips before or after administration of the solution, masking of the taste by administration with sweet or tangy foods, chocolate syrup, orpeanut butter, for example, or by flavoring the solution by the pharmacist prior to dispensing, areexamples of interventions that may improve tolerability.

Pediatric dose (2-13 years of age): daily. mg (five 250-mg tablets or two 625-mg tablets) twice daily. Some adolescents require higher doses than adults to achieve equivalent drug exposures. Consider using therapeutic drug monitoring toguide appropriate dosing.Nelfinavir (NFV, Viracept) (Last updated November 1, 2012; last reviewed November 1, 2012) For additional information see Drugs@FDA: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm Formulations Tablets:250 mg and 625 mg Selected Adverse Events Diarrhea Hyperlipidemia Hyperglycemia Fat maldistribution Possible increase in bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia Serum transaminase elevations Special Instructions Administer NFV with meal or light snack. If co-administered with didanosine (ddI), administer NFV 2 hours before or 1 hour after ddI. Patients unable to swallow NFV tablets can dissolve the tablets in a small amount ofwater. Once tablets are dissolved, patientsshould mix the cloudy mixture well andconsume it immediately. The glass should berinsed with water and the rinse swallowed toensure that the entire dose is consumed.Tablets can also be crushed and administeredwith pudding or other nonacidic foods.

However, ritonavir boosting does not nelfinavir concentrations and co-administration of nelfinavir with ritonavir is not recommended. There is potential for multiple drug interactions with nelfinavir.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-86 Before administering nelfinavir, carefully review a patient's medication profile for potential drug interactions. Major Toxicities: More common: Diarrhea (most common), asthenia, abdominal pain, rash, and lipid abnormalities. Less common (more severe): Exacerbation of chronic liver disease, fat redistribution. Rare: New onset diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes mellitus, spontaneous bleeding in hemophiliacs, and elevations in transaminases. Resistance: The International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (seehttp://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/NFV .html ). Pediatric Use: Nelfinavir is a protease inhibitor (PI) that has been used in combination with 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in children aged >2 years. Nelfinavir is not recommended fortreatment in children aged <2 years (see Recommendations for Use of Antiretroviral Drugs in Pregnant HIV-1-Infected Women for Maternal Health and Interventions to Reduce Perinatal HIV Transmission in the United States for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV ). Nelfinavir in combination with other antiretroviral drugs has been extensively studied in HIV-infectedchildren. 1-8In randomized trials of children ages 2 to 13 years receiving nelfinavir as part of triple antiretroviral therapy (ART), the proportion of patients with HIV RNA <400 copies/mL through 48weeks of therapy has been quite variable, ranging from 26% to 69%. In clinical studies, virologic andimmunologic response to nelfinavir-based therapy has varied according to the patient's age or priorhistory of ART, the number of drugs included in the combination regimen, and dose of nelfinavir used.The relatively poor ability of nelfinavir to control plasma viremia in infants and children may be relatedin part to the ARV's reduced potency compared with other PIs or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptaseinhibitors as well as highly variable drug exposure, metabolism, and poor patient acceptance of availableformulations. 9-11 Administration of nelfinavir with food increases nelfinavir exposure (area under the curve increased byas much as five fold) and decreases pharmacokinetic (PK) variability relative to the fasted state. Drugexposure may be even more unpredictable in pediatric patients than in adults because of increasedclearance of nelfinavir observed in children, and difficulties in taking nelfinavir with sufficient food toimprove bioavailability. A pediatric powder formulation, no longer available, was poorly tolerated whenmixed with food or formula. In the PENTA-7 trial, 35% (7 of 20) of infants started on powder atinitiation of therapy were switched from the powder to crushed tablets because of difficultyadministering the oral formulation to the infants. 1A slurry made by dissolving nelfinavir tablets in water or other liquids can be administered to children who are unable to swallow tablets. The bioavailability of dissolved nelfinavir tablets is comparable to that of tablets swallowed whole.12 Nelfinavir is metabolized by multiple CYP2C19. M8, themajor oxidative metabolite, has in vitro antiviral activity comparable to the parent drug. The variability of drug exposure at any given dose is much higher for children than adults, 13which has been attributed at least in part to differences in the diets of children and adults. Two population PK studies of nelfinavir and its active metabolite, M8, describe the large intersubject variability observed in children.14, 15 Analysis of data from PACTG 377 and PACTG 366 showed that CYP2C19 genotypes altered nelfinavirPKs and the virologic responses to combination therapy in HIV-1-infected children. These findingssuggest that CYP2C19 genotypes are in HIV-1-infected children.9 Antiviral response to nelfinavir is significantly less in children younger than age 2 years than in olderchildren. 6, 8, 16Infants have even lower drug exposures and higher variability in plasma concentrations than children <25 kg; the presence of lower peak drug concentrations and higher apparent oral clearancesuggests that both poor absorption and more rapid metabolism may be contributing factors. 17, 18For these reasons, nelfinavir is not recommended for use in children younger than 2 years of age. In older childrenand adolescents, it is unclear when to change from the recommended 45 to 55 mg/kg twice-daily dose tothe adult dose of 1250 mg twice daily. Doses higher than those recommended in adults may be requiredin some patients. Several studies have demonstrated a correlation between nelfinavir trough concentrations and virologicresponse. In both children and adults an increased risk of virologic failure was associated with lownelfinavir drug exposure, particularly with a nelfinavir minimum plasma concentration (C min) <1.0 mcg/mL.19-21In a study of 32 children treated with nelfinavir 90 mg/kg/day divided into 2 or 3 doses a day, 80% of children with morning trough nelfinavir plasma concentration >0.8 mcg/mL had Week 48 HIV RNAconcentrations <50 copies/mL, compared with only 29% of those with morning trough <0.8 mcg/mL. 22It is of note that the median age of the group with Ctrough <0.8 mcg/mL was 3.8 years, while the median age of the group with Ctrough >0.8 mcg/mL was 8.3 years.22Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of nelfinavir plasma concentrations, with appropriate adjustments for low drug exposure, results in improved outcome inadults treated with nelfinavir. 19, 23Given the higher variability of nelfinavir plasma concentrations in infants and children, the benefits of TDM and appropriate dose adjustment may be even greater for children. Bettervirologic responses were demonstrated in two pediatric trials in which TDM was used to guide dosing. 15, 24 References 1. Aboulker JP, Babiker A, Chaix ML, et al.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-89Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-90Dosing Recommendations RTV as a pharmacokinetic (PK) enhancer: The major of RTV is as a PK enhancer of otherprotease inhibitors used in pediatric patients and inadolescents and adults. The dose of RTVrecommended varies and is specific to the drugcombination selected. See dosing information forspecific protease inhibitors (PIs). In the unusual situation when RTV is prescribed as sole PI: See manufacturer guidelines.Ritonavir (RTV, Norvir) (Last updated November 1, 2012; last reviewed November 1, 2012) For additional information see Drugs@FDA: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm Formulations Oral solution (contains 43% alcohol by volume): 80 mg/mL Capsules:100 mg Tablets:100 mg Selected Adverse Events Gastrointestinal (GI) intolerance, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea Paresthesias (circumoral and extremities) Hyperlipidemia, especially hypertriglyceridemia Hepatitis Asthenia Taste perversion Hyperglycemia Fat maldistribution Possible increased bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia Toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens- Johnson syndrome Special Instructions Administer RTV with food to increase absorption and reduce GI side effects. If RTV is prescribed with didanosine (ddI), administer the drugs 2 hours apart. Refrigerate RTV capsules only if the capsules will not be used within 30 days or cannot be stored below 77\u00b0F (25\u00b0C). RTV tablets areheat stable. Do not refrigerate solution; store at room temperature (68-77\u00b0F or 20-25\u00b0C).Shake the solution well before use. RTV oral solution has limited shelf life; use within 6 months. Patients who have persistent or significant nausea with the capsule may benefit fromswitching to the tablet. Also, the tablet is smallerthan the capsule and thus easier to swallow.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-91Drug Interactions (see also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents ): Metabolism: Ritonavir is extensively metabolized by and is one of the most potent inhibitors of hepatic cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A). There is potential for multiple drug interactions with ritonavir. Before ritonavir is administered, a patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential interactions with ritonavir and overlapping toxicities with other drugs. Avoid concomitant use of intranasal or inhaled fluticasone. Use caution when prescribing ritonavir with other inhaled steroids because of reports of adrenal insufficiency.1-3 Major Toxicities: More common: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, abdominal pain, anorexia, circumoral paresthesia, lipid abnormalities. Less common (more severe): Exacerbation of hyperglycemia, bleeding in hemophiliacs, pancreatitis, and hepatitis (life-threatening in rare cases). Allergic reactions, including bronchospasm, urticaria, and angioedema.To increase tolerability of RTV oral solution in children: Mix solution with milk, chocolate milk, or vanilla or chocolate pudding or ice cream. Before administration, give a child ice chips, a popsicle, or spoonfuls of partially frozenorange or grape juice concentrate to dull thetaste buds, or give peanut butter to coat themouth. After administration, give a child strong- tasting foods such as maple syrup, cheese, orhighly flavored chewing gum. Metabolism Cytochrome with hepaticimpairment: RTV is primarily metabolized by the liver. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patientswith mild or moderate hepatic impairment.Data are unavailable on RTV dosing for adultor pediatric patients with severe hepaticimpairment. Use when administeringRTV to patients with have occurred.4 Resistance: Resistance to ritonavir is not clinically relevant when the drug is used as a pharmacokinetic (PK) enhancer of other protease inhibitors (PIs). Pediatric Use: Ritonavir has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the pediatric population. Use of ritonavir as the sole PI in antiretroviral therapy (ART) in children is not recommended. However, in both children and adults, ritonavir is recommended as a PK enhancer toboost another/second PI in an ART regimen. Ritonavir acts by inhibiting the metabolism of the second(boosted) PI in the regimen, thereby increasing the plasma concentration of the second/boosted PI.Lopinavir/ritonavir, a PI coformulation, has been well studied in children and is a preferred PI fortherapy in children (see Lopinavir/Ritonavir ). fosamprenavir, tipranavir, darunavir, atazanavir are available (see individual PIs for more specificinformation). Although ritonavir has been well studied, its use in children as a sole PI for therapy is limited because ritonavir is associated with a higher incidence of GI toxicity and has a greater potential for drug-druginteractions than other PIs. Also, ritonavir as a sole PI is associated with a higher risk of virologic failurethan efavirenz or lopinavir/ritonavir. 5-7In addition, poor palatability of the liquid preparation and large pill burden with the capsules (adult dose is six capsules or tablets twice daily) limit its use as a sole PI.Concentrations are highly variable in children younger than 2 years, and doses of 350 to 450 mg/m 2 twice a day may not be sufficient for long-term suppression of viral replication in this age group.8-19 Full-dose ritonavir has been shown to prolong the PR interval in a study of healthy adults who weregiven ritonavir at 400 mg twice daily. 4Potentially life-threatening arrhythmias in premature newborn infants treated with lopinavir/ritonavir have been reported; thus, lopinavir/ritonavir should not be used inthis group of patients. 20, 21Co-administration of ritonavir with other drugs that prolong the PR interval (e.g., macrolides, quinolones, methadone) should be undertaken with caution because it is unknown howco-administering any of these drugs with ritonavir will affect the PR interval. In addition, ritonavirshould be used with caution in patients who may be at increased risk of developing cardiac conductionabnormalities, such as those with underlying structural heart disease, conduction system abnormalities,ischemic heart disease, or cardiomyopathy.

Before administration, a patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions. Major Toxicities: More common: Diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, headache, nausea, paresthesias, skin rash, and lipid abnormalities. Less common (more severe): Exacerbation of chronic liver disease, fat maldistribution. Rare: New diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, diabetes mellitus, hemophiliacs, pancreatitis, and elevation in serum transaminases. The combination of saquinavir and ritonavir could lead to prolonged PR and/or QTintervals with potential for heart block and torsades de pointes. Resistance: The International AIDS Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (seehttp://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/SQV .html ). Pediatric Use: Saquinavir is not Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for use in children. Saquinavir has been studied with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and other proteaseinhibitors (PIs) in HIV-infected children. 1-6Initial studies suggest that saquinavir should not be used without boosting by ritonavir or lopinavir/ritonavir. A pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of 5 children agedyounger than 2 years and 13 children aged 2 to 5 years using a dose of 50 mg/kg twice daily with boostingritonavir demonstrated that drug exposure was lower in children younger than age 2 years whereas drugexposure was adequate in those ages 2 to 5 years. 7For this reason, saquinavir should not be given to children younger than age 2 years until an appropriate dose is identified. In children aged 2 years, a doseof 50 mg/kg twice daily (maximum dose = 1000 mg) boosted with ritonavir 3 mg/kg twice daily (patientsweighing 5 - <15 kg) or 2.5 mg/kg twice daily (patients weighing 15 - 40 kg) resulted in area under thecurve and steady state trough concentration (C trough ) values similar to those in older children8, 9and adults. Because there is no pediatric formulation, in one study saquinavir was formulated by breaking open the200-mg hard-gel capsules and mixing capsule contents with sugar syrup, jam, or baby formula. Sorbitolsyrup was used for patients with diabetes or glucose intolerance. 7 Both saquinavir/ritonavir and saquinavir/lopinavir/ritonavir regimens are promising for salvage therapy in children.1, 3-6, 8-10In a study evaluating the addition of saquinavir (750 mg/m2of body surface area every 12 hours, maximum dose 1600 mg) to a regimen containing lopinavir/ritonavir dosed at 400/100 mg/m2of body surface area twice daily (for patients not concurrently taking a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI]) or lopinavir/ritonavir 480/120 mg/m2of body surface area twice daily for patients concurrently administered an NNRTI, 18 subjects (median age 14.2 years, range 7.7-17.6 years) were enrolled. The addition of saquinavir at these doses was well tolerated and did not appear to alter lopinavir PKs. Saquinavir dosing was adjusted in four patients (decreased in three, increased in one).10 In a study of 50 Thai children, saquinavir/lopinavir/ritonavir was initiated as second-line therapy based on extensive NRTI resistance. In this group, saquinavir was dosed at 50 mg/m2of body surface area and lopinavir/ritonavir was dosed at 230/57.5 mg/m2of body surface area, all twice daily. After 96 weeks oftreatment, 74% of the children achieved an undetectable plasma RNA load at <50 copies/mL. Therapeutic drug monitoring was used to establish adequate minimum plasma concentration (Cmin) values and to aid with alterations in drug dosage based upon toxicity. Most Cminvalues for saquinavir were above the desired trough value of 0.1 mg/L. The average Cminthroughout 96 weeks for saquinavir was 1.37 mg/L, and when saquinavir doses were adjusted, most were decreased by an average of 21% (8 mg/kg). Mediantotal cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein values increased significantly through 96 weeks from 144 to196 mg/dL and from 44 to 57 mg/dL, respectively. 8, 9 In a healthy adult volunteer study, saquinavir/ritonavir use was associated with increases in both QT andPR intervals. 11The degree of QT prolongation was greater than that seen with some other boosted PIs. Rare cases of torsades de pointes and complete heart block have been reported in post-marketingsurveillance. Saquinavir/ritonavir is not recommended for patients with any of the following conditions:documented congenital or acquired QT complete atrioventricular block without implantedpacemakers, at risk of complete A V block, or receiving other drugs that prolong QT interval. Anelectrocardiogram is recommended before initiation of therapy with saquinavir and should be consideredduring therapy. References 1. Ananworanich J, Kosalaraksa P, Hill A, et al.

Before tipranavir is administrated, a patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions. Tipranavir should be used with caution in patients who are receiving medications known to increase the risk of bleeding, such as antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants, or high doses of supplemental vitamin E. Major Toxicities: More common: Diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, headache, rash (more frequent in children than in adults), and vomiting. Elevated transaminases, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Less common (more severe): Lipodystrophy. Hepatotoxicity: clinical hepatitis and hepatic decompensation, including some fatalities. Patients with chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C coinfection or elevations in transaminases are at increased risk of developing further transaminase elevations or hepatic bleeding in hemophiliacs. Increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage.Tipranavir should be used with caution in patients who may be at risk of increased bleeding fromtrauma, surgery, or other medical conditions. Resistance: The International AIDS Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (seehttp://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/TPV .html ).surgery, or other medical conditions or who are receiving medications known to increasethe risk of bleeding, such as antiplateletagents, anticoagulants, or high doses ofsupplemental vitamin E. Use of TPV is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic Metabolism Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inducer and substrate. Dosing in patients with renal impairment : No dose adjustment required. Dosing in patients with hepatic impairment : No dose adjustment required for mild hepaticimpairment; use contraindicated formoderate-to-severe hepatic impairment.Pediatric Use: Tipranavir is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for use in children aged 2 years who are treatment-experienced and infected with HIV strains resistant to more than one protease inhibitor (PI).1The use of tipranavir is limited by the high pill burden imposed on patients taking tipranavir capsules, including the burden of taking a higher dose of boosting ritonavir than is required withother PIs. This increased dose of ritonavir is associated with greater potential for drug interactions andincreased toxicity. In addition, tipranavir is associated with serious adverse events that limit its use topatients with few treatment options. However, tipranavir is approved for use in children as young as age 2years and is available in a liquid formulation. FDA approval of tipranavir was based on a multicenter, pediatric study of the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PKs) of tipranavir/ritonavir in HIV-infected children (PACTG 1051/BI-1182.14). 2This enrolled treatment-experienced children (with the exception of 3 treatment-naive patients) ages 2 to18 years (median age 11.7 years) with baseline HIV RNA 1,500 copies/mL. Children in 3 age strata wererandomized to 2 different doses of tipranavir/ritonavir: tipranavir/ritonavir 290 mg/115 mg per m 2body surface area (low dose, 58 patients) or 375 mg/150 mg/m2body surface area (high dose, 57 patients) twice daily, plus optimized background therapy. All children initially received the oral solution but patients whowere aged 12 years or older and receiving the maximum adult dose of 500 mg tipranavir/200 mg ritonavirtwice daily were eligible to switch to tipranavir capsules after Week 4. At baseline, resistance to allcommercially available PIs was present in greater than 50% of patient isolates, and the tipranavir/ritonavirmutation scores increased with age. 2At 48 weeks, 39.7% of patients receiving the low dose and 45.6% of those receiving the high dose had viral loads <400 copies/mL. The groups did not differ in percentage ofpatients who achieved viral loads <50 copies/mL. The proportion of patients with HIV RNA levels <400copies/mL tended to be greater in the youngest patients (70%) who had less baseline resistance. Tipranavirtreatment was associated with a mean increase in CD4 T lymphocyte count of 100 cells/mm 3and 59 cells/mm3in low- and high-dose groups, respectively. Overall, adverse effects were similar between treatment groups. Twenty-five percent of children experienced a drug-related serious adverse event, and9% of patients discontinued study drugs because of adverse events. The most common adverse eventswere gastrointestinal disturbances; 37% of participants had vomiting and 24% had diarrhea. Moderate orsevere laboratory toxicity (primarily increase in gamma glutamyl transpeptidase and creatinephosphokinase) was seen in 11% of children. Four patients (all in the low-dose group) developed AIDS-defining illnesses through 48 weeks. A Kaplan-Meier analysis comparing AIDS-defining events in thelow-dose versus high-dose group reached statistical significance (P = 0.04). In a multivariate model, three variables (listed in order) predicted virologic outcome: greater genotypic inhibitory <100,000 copies/mL. GIQ is calculated by dividing the tipranavirtrough concentration by the number of tipranavir resistance-conferring mutations genotyped from a patient's HIV strain. The GIQ was consistently greater in the high-dose group. Based on these findings and the increased number of AIDS-defining events in the low-dose group, high-dose tipranavir/ritonavir has been recommended. PKs of the liquid formulation at steady state were assessed. 3In children ages 2 to <12 years, at a dosage of tipranavir/ritonavir 290/115 mg/m2body surface area, tipranavir trough concentrations were consistent with those achieved in adults receiving standard tipranavir/ritonavir 500 mg/200 mg dosing. However, children ages 12 to 18 years required a higher dose (375/150 mg/m2body surface area, 30% higher than the directly scaled adult dose) to achieve drug exposure similar to that in adults receiving the standard tipranavir/ritonavir dose. Population PK analysis demonstrated that tipranavir clearance can be affected by body weight and that volume of distribution can be affected by age.3Based on these studies, the final dose of tipranavir/ritonavir 375/150 mg/m2body surface area twice daily is recommended. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-101Vitamin E is an excipient in the tipranavir oral solution, with a concentration of 116 IU of vitamin E and 100 mg tipranavir/mL of solution. The recommended dose of tipranavir (14 mg/kg body weight) results ina vitamin E dose of 16 IU/kg body weight per day, significantly higher than the reference daily intake forvitamin E (10 IU) and close to the upper limit of tolerability for children. In PACTG 1051, bleeding eventswere reported more commonly in children receiving tipranavir oral capsules (14.3%) than in childrentaking tipranavir oral solution (5.75%). 2Overall, the incidence of bleeding episodes (primarily epistaxis) in pediatric patients observed in clinical trials was 7.5%.4 References 1.

To minimize local reactions apply ice or heat after injection or gently massage injection siteGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-105Drug Interactions (see also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents ): There are no known significant drug interactions with enfuvirtide. Major Toxicities: More common: Almost all patients (87%-98%) experience local injection site reactions including pain and discomfort, induration, erythema, nodules and cysts, pruritus, and ecchymosis. Reactions are usually mild to moderate in severity but can be more severe. Average duration of local injectionsite reaction is 3 to 7 days, but was >7 days in 24% of patients. Less common (more severe): Increased rate of bacterial pneumonia (unclear association). Rare: Hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) (<1%) including fever, nausea and vomiting, chills, rigors, hypotension, and elevated liver transaminases; immune-mediated reactions including primaryimmune complex reaction, respiratory distress, glomerulonephritis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome.Patients experiencing HSRs should seek immediate medical attention. Therapy should not berestarted in patients with signs and symptoms consistent with HSRs. Pediatric specific: Local site cellulitis requiring antimicrobial therapy (up to 11% in certain subgroups of patients in pediatric studies). 1 Resistance: The International AIDS Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (seehttp://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/GRIP/ENF.html ). Pediatric Use: Although enfuvirtide is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for use in children, it is not commonly used because of its high cost, need for twice-daily subcutaneous (SQ) injections, and high rate of injection site reactions. Use in deep salvage regimens2has also declined with the availability of integrase inhibitors and other entry inhibitors (such as maraviroc). A single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation study of enfuvirtide given SQ to 14 HIV-infected children aged 4 to 12 years (PACTG 1005) identified that enfuvirtide 60 mg/m2of body surface area per dose resulted in a target trough concentration that approximated the \"equivalent\" of a 90-mg dose delivered SQto better disperse the dose. There are reports of injection-associated neuralgia andparasthesia if alternative delivery systems,such as needle-free injection devices, are used. Advise patient/caregiver of the possibility of an HSR; instruct them to discontinue treatmentand seek immediate medical attention if thepatient develops signs and symptomsconsistent with an HSR. Metabolism Catabolism to constituent amino acids.to an adult (1,000 mg/mL).3In a second pediatric study of 25 children aged 5 to 16 years, a 2-mg/kg dose (maximum 90 mg) of enfuvirtide given twice daily yielded drug concentrations similar to 60 mg/m2of body surface area dose independent of age group, body weight, body surface area, and sexual maturation.4 The FDA-recommended dose of enfuvirtide for children aged 6 to 16 years is 2 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg) administered SQ twice daily. Further data are needed for dosing in children aged <6 years. The safety and antiretroviral (ARV) activity of twice-daily SQ enfuvirtide administration at 60 mg/m2per dose plus optimized background therapy (OBT) was evaluated over 96 weeks in 14 children aged 4 to 12 years who had failed to achieve viral suppression on multiple prior ARV regimens (PACTG 1005). At 24weeks 71% of the children had a >1.0 log reduction in viral load; 43% and 21% of children maintained virologic suppression (>1.0 log decrease in HIV RNA) at Week 96. Most children had localinjection site reactions. 6Significant improvements in CD4 percentage and height z score were observed in children receiving enfuvirtide for 48 and 96 weeks. T20-310, a Phase I/II study of enfuvirtide (2.0 mg/kg SQ, maximum 90 mg, twice daily) plus OBT, enrolled 52 treatment-experienced children aged 3 to 16 years for 48 weeks. Only 64% of the childrencompleted 48 weeks of therapy. The median decrease in HIV RNA was -1.17 log 10copies/mL (n = 32) and increase in CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4 cell) count was 106 cells/mm3(n = 25). At Week 8, treatment responses as measured by several plasma HIV RNA parameters were superior in younger children (aged<11 years) compared with adolescents. Median increases in CD4 cell count were 257 cells/mm 3in children and 84 cells/mm3in adolescents. Local skin reactions were common in all age groups (87% of study participants). The observed differential responses between children and adolescents probably reflectunique challenges to adherence with the prescribed regimen. 1 An increased rate of bacterial pneumonia was observed in adults treated with enfuvirtide in some studies(FDA) but not in others. 7Pediatric studies have lacked the statistical power to answer questions concerning enfuvirtide use and increased risk of pneumonia.

Use MVC in patientswith only CCR5-tropic virus. Do not use ifCXCR4 or mixed/dual-tropic HIV is present. MVC can be given without regard to food. Instruct patients on how to recognize symptoms of allergic reactions or hepatitis. Use caution when administering MVC to patients with underlying cardiac disease. Metabolism Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) substrate Dosing of MVC hepatic impairment: Use caution when administering MVC to patients with hepatic impairment. BecauseMVC is metabolized by the liver,Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-109Drug Interactions (see also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents ): Absorption: Absorption of maraviroc is somewhat reduced with ingestion of a high-fat meal; however, maraviroc can be given with or without food. Metabolism: Maraviroc is a CYP3A4 and p-glycoprotein (Pgp) substrate and requires dosage adjustments when administered with CYP- or Pgp-modulating medications. Before administration, a patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions with maraviroc. Major Toxicities: More common: Cough, fever, upper respiratory tract infections, rash, musculoskeletal symptoms, abdominal pain, and dizziness. Less common (more severe): Hepatotoxicity that may be preceded by evidence of a systemic allergic reaction (such as pruritic rash, eosinophilia or elevated immunoglobulin [IgE]) has been reported. Serious adverse events occurred in less than 2% of maraviroc-treated adult patients and includedcardiovascular abnormalities (such AIDS Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ). Clinical failure may also represent the outgrowth of CXCR4-using (naturally resistant) HIV variants. Pediatric Use: The pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and efficacy of maraviroc in patients aged <16 years have not been established. A dose-finding study is under way in children aged 2 to 17 years.1In this trial, maraviroc dose is based upon body surface area and the presence or absence of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor in the background regimen. Preliminary PK data are encouraging in those on a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, but exposures are very low in those not on a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Reference 1.

Chewable tablets may be chewed or swallowed whole. Film-coated tablets and chewable tablets are not interchangeable. Chewable tablets have better bioavailability than the film-coatedtablets. Chewable tablets should be stored inthe original package of RAL in patients with hepatic impairment : No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild-to-moderatehepatic insufficiency. No dosing information isavailable for patients with severe hepaticimpairment. Dosing of RAL in patients with renal impairment : No dosage adjustment necessary.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-112Drug Interactions (see also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents ): Metabolism: The major route of raltegravir elimination is mediated through glucuronidation by UGT1A1. Inducers of UGT1A1 such as rifampin and tipranavir may result in reduced plasma concentrations of raltegravir whereas inhibitors of UGT1A1 such as atazanavir may increase plasma concentrations of raltegravir. Efavirenz and etravirine may decrease raltegravir concentrations. Before administration, a patient's medication profile should be carefully reviewed for potential drug interactions with raltegravir. Major Toxicities:More common: Nausea, headache, dizziness, diarrhea, fatigue, and itching. Less common: Abdominal pain, vomiting, insomnia. Patients with chronic active hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C are more likely to experience worsening aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or total bilirubin patients who are not coinfected. Rare: Creatine phosphokinase elevations (Grade 2-4) have been observed in some patients. Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Use raltegravir with caution in patients receivingmedications associated with these toxicities. Anxiety, depression, especially in those with priorhistory. Rash including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hypersensitivity reaction, and toxic epidermalnecrolysis have been reported. Thrombocytopenia. Resistance: The International AIDS Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/cgi- bin/INIResiNote.cgi ). Pediatric Use: Raltegravir is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in children aged 2 years. Raltegravir has been studied in 126 antiretroviral (ARV) treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected children and adolescents aged 2 to 18 years in combination with an optimized background ARVregimen in IMPAACT P1066. Additional experience from the French expanded access program intreatment-experienced adolescents support the good virologic and immunologic results observed inP1066. 1, 2 IMPAACT P1066 is a Phase I/II open multicenter study to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile,safety, tolerability, and efficacy of various formulations of raltegravir in HIV-infected children. Subjects received either the 400-mg film-coated tablet formulation twice daily (patients aged 6-18 years and weighing at least 25 kg) or the chewable tablet formulation at a dose of 6 mg/kg twice daily (aged 2 to <12 years). Current pediatric approval and dosing recommendations are based upon these evaluations in 96 patients. 3-7 In IMPAACT P1066, the initial dose-finding stage includes intensive PK evaluation in various age cohorts: (aged 12 to <19 years, 6 to <12 years, 2 to <6 years). Dose selection was based upon achieving target PKparameters similar to those seen in adults: PK targets are geometric mean (GM) area under the curve of 14- 25 \u00b5Mxh and GM 12 h concentration >33 nM. Additional subjects were then enrolled in each age cohort toevaluate long-term efficacy, tolerability, and safety. Ninety-three (97%) subjects completed 24 weeks of treatment with 54% achieving HIV RNA <50 copies/mL with a mean CD4 T lymphocyte count (percent[%]) increase of 119 cells/mm3(3.8%). The frequency, type, and severity of drug-related adverse reactions through week 24 were comparable to those observed in adult studies. Observed adverse reactions considered drug-related included one patient with grade 3 psychomotor hyperactivity, abnormal behavior,and insomnia; one patient with a grade 2 allergic rash; and one patient with grade 3 ALT and grade 4 ASTlaboratory elevations. The investigational raltegravir oral granules for suspension formulation are currently under study in P1066 in children aged 4 weeks to <2 years. Recent data, obtained from 9 children aged 6 months to <2 years,suggest that the oral granules are well tolerated with favorable preliminary efficacy. PK data obtained in 8of the 9 young children achieved targets similar to those observed in the 2- to 11-year-olds receiving thechewable tablets. 8A dosage of 6 mg/kg every 12 hours was chosen for continued study in this age group. The raltegravir chewable tablet has higher oral bioavailability than the film-coated tablet based on acomparative study in healthy adult volunteers. 9In the PK of interpatient V .

Adult dose (aged 18 years): 1 tablet once daily in antiretroviral (ARV) treatment-naive adults. Selected Adverse Events Diarrhea, nausea, flatulence Renal insufficiency Cobicistat alters tubular secretion of creatinine, and therefore, may decrease creatinine-based estimates of glomerularfiltration rate without a true change inglomerular filtration. Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) Special Instructions Administer with food. Monitor estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein; in patients at risk of renal impairment, also monitor serumphosphate. Patients with increase in serumcreatinine >0.4 mg/dL should be closelymonitored for renal safety. Screen patients for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection before use of FTC or TDF. Severeacute exacerbation therefore,monitor hepatic function for several monthsafter therapy with FTC or TDF is stopped. Not recommended for use with other ARV drugs. Metabolism Stribild should not be initiated in patients with estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) <70mL/min and should be discontinued inpatients with estimated CrCl <50 mL/min. Stribild should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric Infection O-115Drug Interactions (see also the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents ): Metabolism: Stribild contains elvitegravir Elvitegravir is metabolized and a modest inducer of CYP2C9. Cobicistat is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6; in addition, it inhibits ATP-dependent transporters BCRP P-glycoproteinand the organic anion transporting polypeptides and OAT1B3. Potential exists for multipledrug interactions. Renal elimination: Drugs that decrease renal function or compete for active tubular secretion could reduce clearance of tenofovir or emtricitabine. Concomitant use of nephrotoxic drugs should beavoided. Protease inhibitors (PIs): Stribild should not be administered concurrent with products or regimens containing ritonavir because of similar effects of cobicistat and ritonavir on CYP3A. Not recommended for use with other ARV drugs. Major Toxicities: More common: Nausea, diarrhea, and flatulence. Less common (more severe): Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with nucleoside reverse inhibitors including tenofovir bone toxicity (osteomalacia andreduced bone density) in animals when given in high doses. Decreases in bone mineral density havebeen reported in both adults and children taking tenofovir; the clinical significance of these changesis not yet known. Evidence of renal toxicity, including increases in serum creatinine, blood ureanitrogen, in serum phosphate,has been observed. Numerous case reports of renal tubular dysfunction have been reported inpatients receiving tenofovir; patients at increased risk of renal dysfunction should be closelymonitored. Resistance: The International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains a list of updated resistance mutations (see http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations/index.html ) and the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database offers a discussion of each mutation (see http://hivdb.stanford.edu/DR/ ). Pediatric Use: Elvitegravir is only available as the fixed-dose combination product Stribild, which contains elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir. Stribild is not U.S. Food and DrugAdministration (FDA)-approved for use in children aged <18 years. There are no data on its use inindividuals aged <18 years. Elvitegravir is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor that is metabolized rapidly by CYP3A4. Cobicistat itself does not have ARV activity, but is a CYP3A4 inhibitor added as a pharmacokinetic enhancer. Cobicistat slows elvitegravir metabolism and allows once-daily administration of the combination. Stribild is FDA-approved as a complete ARV regimen in HIV-1-infected ARV-naive adults aged 18 years1based on trials showing of of creatinine, so creatinine-based calculations of estimated glomerular filtration rate will be altered, even though the actual glomerular filtration rate might be only minimally changed.5Adults who experience a confirmed increase in serum creatinine greater than 0.4 mg/dL from baseline should be closely monitored for renal toxicity.1References 1.
