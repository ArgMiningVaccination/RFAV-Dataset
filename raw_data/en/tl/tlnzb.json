UISA rejects tuition reduction for athletes The UISA voted Tuesday night to oppose the UI Board in Control of Athletics' proposal to reduce out\u00ad of\u00b7state tu ition for ath letes to the same levels as in-state athletes.

Faculty seeking salary increase The Faculty Council released a report which suggested an increase in salary based only on state appropriations. Brad Hahn The Daily Iowan Students will be paying for faculty wary increases if an initial report released to legislators in Des Moines becomes reality. The report, produced by Director of the Legislative Fiscal Bureau Den\u00ad nis Prouty, suggests basing salary increases solely on state appropria\u00ad tions, rather than the current system of basing the increases on the entire general fund. Underwater The difference would mean that money for the increases would have to come from another source, tuition. \"The funding of only the state share of the Board of Regents budget would dictate that tuition would need to be increased to cover its share of the salary costs,\" the report says. The proposal, diBCUSsed Tuesday afternoon at the UI Faculty Coun\u00ad cil meeting, would have a major effect on the UI, Faculty Council President Edward Lawler said. \"Either tuition would be raised or we'd have to become so uncompeti. tive in terms of faculty salary that it would be impossible to maintain the same quality,\" Lawler said. The report also raises the option of changing the employee retirement from the Teachers lnsurance and Annuity Association-College Retirement Equities fund to the Iowa Public Employees Retirement System. The reason behind the switch, Lawler said, was that TIAA-CREF is more expeJUlive. But, he said, TlAA-CREF is also the more prominent plan and is used at many universities through\u00ad out the country. If the UI were to change its plan it would be much leB8 appealing to faculty members, Lawler said. Noting that the report was just released on Tuesday, Lawler said he did not know what it was in response to, or how much weigh,t it would carry. '\"We don't know how much impact this report will have on the Legis\u00b7 lature and we don't know what role it will play in their decision,\u00ad Lawler said. \"We're obvioualy con\u00ad cerned about that because there are BOme errors and misleading things and it involves a change in policy that would have dramatic coD8equences. Lawler said UI President Hunter Rawlings and Interim Vice Presi\u00b7 dent for Finance and University Services Doug True are currently looking into the report. He also said it is possible that the council will address the report at a later date. In other council buaine88: Graduate School Dean Lea Sims spoke about the state of the gradu\u00b7 ate college at the UI. UI Vice President for Academic Affairs Peter Nathan gave the council specifics about the transi\u00b7 Edward ~wler tion from the Office of Academic Affairs to the Office of the Provost.

The bill, which had been tabled at the last meeting, defined political organizations as nonacademic stu\u00b7 dent organizations that publicly advocate or work toward the elec\u00ad tion or defeat of particular candi\u00b7 dates or parties, ballot referen\u00b7 dums and federal, state or local legislation . The definition excluded student advocacy groups, such as UISA and United Students of Iowa, \"which work for legislation which is bene\u00ad ficial to the student body as a whole.\" . Most of the public attending the meeting used the public acceaa portion of the agenda to voice their concerns for the bill. Jess Peters, president of the UI Environmental Coalition, said the definiton tries to lump all organi\u00ad zations together. ~Groups that support specific legislation are not the same as groups that occasionally support political activity,\" she said. ~At this university we hear the theme of diversity and a well-rounded education . I believe this bill works in direct conflict with the universi\u00ad ty's position.\" Peters said the authors of the bill did not have the best interest of the student body in mind when they wrote the bill. ~Almost every iB8ue is going to touch the political realm at BOme time,~ she said. '\"That can't be avoided.~ However, there were BOme that praised the bill. Michael B. Clark said he felt the student. body supported the bill.

No wonder. No Sub auto dealership in the country is in a smaller town, and you can't even see the town from here. Officially, the Meyer Garage is in McIntire, population 147. But the deaJership is actually in a tiny pocket of McIntire about five miles to the west and completely detached from the rest of the city, with nothing in between except a county blacktop and fertile, flat farmland. It's a collection of buildings and houses that the loca1a call Meyer. The only traffic on its main street recently was a large yellow dog moving at a brisk pace toward the church. \"He lives over at this farm,\" said Adams, gesturing to over his shoul\u00ad der to the west. \"I don't know his name.\" \"/ had a heck of a good month last month; sold 18 cars.\" Jerry Adams, car dealer So what is Adams doing out here? \"They aJways ask me that,\" he said. The reply is easy, practiced. \"I was born and raised here and this is where I want to live. I don't liIr.e the rat race.\" Businesses usually follow the cus\u00ad tomers, but for nearly 30 years it has been the other way around at the Meyer Garage. Adams' father, Edmund, opened the place in the Depression, built a loyaJ following and started selling Saabs in 1964, just six years after the Swedi.h car began to be imported. The showroom is plain but pleas\u00ad ant, big enough for two new cars, the only new cars on hand this day. One is a1ready sold. MI had a heck of a good month last month; sold 18 cars,\" Adams said. Six were new. Four new ones are auppoaed to arrive any day. Adams sells two models, a basic midsize that sells for about $23,000 and the luxury model for $37,000. He said he sold about 30 new cars last year. That's fewer than he'd like, \"But you have to remember, the economy has been down.\" In recent months, he also Ildded new Lawn Boy lawn mowers, which line the showroom walls. His theory is that people attracted to a top-end mower might liIr.e a top-end car, too. \"I'm thinlr.ing of putting an ad in the paper: get a free Lawn Boy if you buy a Saab. My dad tried it with TVs once. It didn't work too well, but he did get two custom\u00ad ers.\" There isn't much market for pricey cars in northern Iowa, aJthough Adams, 54, said a few farmers own them. Durability is a point he makes time after time. \"We've got five or six around here with 300,000 miles on them, going strong: he said. But friend and neighbor Marvin King said that for most people in the area, Saabs are too expensive. \"You ask him, how can you afford one of them? He'll just tell you how long they last,\" King said. Most of the Saab business comes from people who live hours away, places such as Des Moines, which is three hours south, and Minnea\u00ad polis, two hours north. There are Saab deaJerships in those cities and Adams has nothing untoward to say about them. But he does mention \"low over\u00ad head\" as one of his selling points. The shop rate of his three repair\u00ad men -two of them sons Marty and Chris -is $37 an hour. \"In the Twin Cities, it's $58,\" he said. Elke Martin, media information manager for Saab America in Nor\u00ad cross, Ga., said many Saab deaJer\u00ad .hips began in smaller towns when Saab was introduced in America in 1958. \"It was popular in Swedish com-Associated Press Sam dNIer Jerry Adams sils on a Lawn Boy lawn mower in lhe showroom of hi. car dealership in Meyer, Iowa, Friday. munities,\u00b7 she said. Meyer is strictly German. Of Saab's 315 American dealers, the Meyer Garage is in the smaJ\u00ad lest community . Next sma1lest, she said, is the Gibson Motor Co. in Perryville, Ind., population 637. \"When Saabs were first intro\u00ad duced, they enjoyed cult status,\" she said. \"It had a rich racing heritage. Today, it's much more of a premium brand than it was in the'1950s. It's not a cookifH:Utter rar.\" She said 26,000 Saabs are Eiold in the United States each. year. Adams doesn't like the rat race, but that's where he learned about Saabs. He tOOk a job at a Saab deaJership in Minneapolis in the early 196Os, learned its attributes and brought one home for a weekend. After a drive in the country, the senior Adams ordered one for himself, and it wasn't long before the deaJership was open.

The plan could mean a big payoff for founder Ted Turner, The Wall Street Journal reported. Turner has tried to strike deaJs with Capital Cities-ABC Inc. and Paramount Communications Inc., but has been blocked by Time Warner and TCI, The Journal reported. Time Warner and TCI want to divide TBS's assets between them as a way to resolve the struggle over the empire's future e,nd keep control of Turner's holdings in the cable industry, The Journal said, citing unidentified people familiar with the tallr.a.

The new ticlr.ets were developed by Georgia-based Scientific Games. The procetl8 eliminates the need for a silver foil laminate used previously as a security device in acratch tickets.

The tickets can be recycled or will decompose, he said. \"Hot Sevens\" is the first game to feature the new batch of ticketl!l, which went on BaJe last week. Stanek said all of Iowa's scratch tickets will have the new feature, but there are no immediate plans to establish recycling bins for the used tickets. votes and about 37 percent of the company's equity. Ceding control of TBS to the two cable companies could raise a red flag with Washington regulators, The Journal said. To thwart that roadblock, Tel a1ready has diverted most of its programming assets to a new com\u00ad pany, Liberty Media Corp., accord\u00ad ing to the report. AmongTBS' holdings are the TBS Superstation, TNT, Hanna\u00ad Barbera Productions, Cable News Network, MGM libraries, the Atlanta Braves, Atlanta Hawks, and the CNN Center and Omni Coliseum, both in Atlanta. Time Warner, which counts HBO and Cinemax among its many holdings, and TCI, one of the nation's largest cable TV operators, bought their stakes in Turner in 1987 as part of a bailout of the debt-ridden company. In that deal, Time secured the right to control the jewel Cable News Network if Turner is ever liquidated, th.e paper also said. Family working on casket makes man late for funeral Associated Press FAIRBANKS, Alaska -George Vey was late to his own funeral. Or rather his casket was late, with him in it, because Vey's family built it themselves. The Ve18 worked the whole night before the service on March 30. They put stain on the casket and it didn't dry in time. They were a ha1f-hour late. Vey, who died at age 62, would have appreciated his family's efforts, said his wife, Ruth Vey. \"I loved it because that's more love than most people get,\" she said. Vey's four sons, George, Edward, Franklin and Robert, and his son-in-law, David Thompson, said they were inspired by a newspaper story last month about a California mortician who sells blueprints for do-it-yourself coffins. And they said they were unin\u00ad spired by the funeral home's expensive caskets: copper, stain\u00ad less steel, solid oak, bronze, 18-gauge steel. A factory-made casket runs $1,000 to $2,000. ~t's like buying a gorgeous diJUllond ring and burying it,\" said Colleen Thompson, Vey's daughter.

Ellen Dovre, a UI graduate stu\u00ad dent in religion who is in her second semester of the German readinga, eaid the course is \"tre\u00ad mendous\" in helping students deal with foreign language texts. \"It helpe you learn not just how to read a text, but also how to understand it; she said. \"I. think that's where the energy for the course cornea from -the text comea alive when you read it in the original language . Klemm said the program offers a good chance for graduate students to expand their education. \"It's not only an exciting program, but we think it marks a genuine breakthrough in graduate educa\u00ad tion,\u00b7 he said. Reading for Research also offers many advantages to graduate stu\u00ad dents, Klemm said. \"Many students are now able, as a result of the program, to do scho\u00ad larly research of a higher caliber, write dissertations they wouldn't have dreamed of writing without the courses, and compete for higher-level academic positions,\u00b7 he said. ~~~~~!!!!!!!!!!~ The Second Act \"The Finest In Consigned Clothing\" Carry in your clothes, Carry away cashl The dea1lD town.

The task force recommendation would be linked to propoaals being developed by President Clinton for health-care reform, the governor said.

Susan Winterbottom : The Daily Iowan Leaviq your native country for the tint time can be an eliciting aDd IOmetimes acary experience. To help VI student travelers pre\u00ad pare for their journeYI, a seriel of four lectures baa been arranged by the VI Study Abroad Office. 'nte series, \"Predeparture Sugges\u00ad tione for Student Travelera: began March 31 with the seminar \"What It's Like to be a Foreigner.\" The lleries will continue with a seminar every Wednesday for the nen three weelu at \" p.m. in the International Center Lounge. Phil Carla, a VI study abroad adviser, said the seminars are geared toward first-time student travelera. \"A lot of our students are going abroad for the first time,~ he said. \"It's generally a good idea to find out about the place you are going to and what you're getting yourself into.\" The seminara cover a wide variety of topics, from culture shock to health and safety. Today'l semi\u00ad nar, \"Field Learning Abroad,\" will obser\u00ad vation Carls said the semi\u00ad nar covers an important alpect of studying abroad. 'The upcoming seminar talks about le~ outside of the cl888-room, which is a lot of the study abroad esperience,~ he said. The seminara are valuable, Carla said, because they inform students about 88pec:ta of traveling they may not have expected. \"We want the students to have the knowledge and skills they're going to need when they go to a foreign country: he said. 'The rules there are a little different and the stu\u00ad dents need to be aware of that and act accordingly.\" UI IOphomore Marcia lOenk, who attended last week's seminar, agreed. \"I think the seminar prepared us for the different customs, like handshakes and eye contact, that we don't think about every day over here,\" said lOenk, who will be studying in Lyon, France over the summer. VI IOphomore Angela Bowman Architects ready to break ground on new pedestrian thoroughfare The walkway is designed to return the campus to a student\u00ad oriented environment. Mary Geraghty The Daily Iowan Students returning to the VI nen fall will notice several changes in, th,e physical appearance of the campus. These changes, which include renovations on the Old Capitol, new windows in Schaeffer Hall and the North Capitol Street improve\u00ad ment project, were discussed at the Campus Planning Committee meeting Tuesday. The goal of the North Capitol Street project, which W88 the only project discussed in detail, is to create a pedestrian area which is a \"people-active\" space, according to Rich Gardner, a repreBentative of Crose-Gardner Associates, Land\u00ad scape Architects and Planners, the company in charge of designing the walkway. \"It is designed 80 people move through the space so that it becomes a dynamic space and not a tight, organized space, ~ Gardner said. The area his company is working with is the block of North Capitol Street between Jefferson and Market streets, just north of the Pentacrest. The most discussion was gener\u00ad ated about the proposed kiosk with four bulletin boards in front of the North Capitol parking ramp. Sev\u00ad eral membera said that a bulletin board with old, tom papera hang\u00ad ing would not be visually appeal\u00b7 ing. It W88 suggested that the struc\u00ad ture be more like a gazebo 80 people could uee the space for cl888 meetings or study groupe instead of just walking through it. Gardner said he would take all the suggestions that were offered into consideration. -rhis is an important enough space in one of the highest traffic are88 on campus that it ought to be special,\" he said. Other changes that are part of the project include moving the bus stop and bike racks currently located at the lOuth end of the block further e88t on Jefferson Street to facili\u00ad tate pedestrian movement. Because fewer people will be mov\u00ad ing through the construction area when this semester ends, most of the work on these projects will not begin until the middle of May. The committee also diacuseed the proposed fire ents for the UI Medical Laboratoriee and a poRi\u00ad ble addition to the UI Power Plant. ; Bill could force Christian Scientists to seek ~ 'medical care for children or face charges f ' Tom Seery Associated Press DES MOINES- The Iowa Senate is rebuffing attempts to require Christian Science Church members to obtain medical care for their children. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted in February for a bill repeal\u00ad ing the religious exemptions in ltate law relating to health care for children. The bill would allow the state to file criminal charges and permanently remove children from parents who refuse to provide eseential medical care. The bill would affect Christian Science Church members, who have lobbied against the measure. The bill has languished in the Senate 88 its supportera try to crack what appears to be a solid block of opposition. The bill W88 debated briefly Tues\u00ad day in the Senate. A final vote W88 delayed by the bill's manager, Aurelia Republican Linn Fuhrman , after the Senate rejected his prop\u00ad oeed compromise to require only immunizations against childhood diseases. Fuhrman said he wants a chance to come up with another proposal that can clear the Senate, but time is running out. The bill must be approved by the full Senate and a House committee by Friday to remain eligible in the tinal weeks of the legislative session. \"Freedom of religion and rights of family are very important.\" Maggie Tinsman, senator Sen. Maggie Tinsman, R-Davenport. \"Let us not tamper with these important rights and responsibilities. \" Another critic of the bill is Des Moines Democratic Sen. Elaine Szymoniak. She said the Legisla\u00ad ture Ihould not dismiss Christian Science principles of prayer and healing. \"l'here ill growing recognition in this country that medical healing is not the only way to heal,\" she said. Sen. Ralph Rosenberg, D-Ames, said current law is adequate because it allows courts to intervene and require medical treatment in lOme cases. He said the bill is too severe. \"l'he current law worlu.

Somewhere in the diltance there was a quiet thud. I remember thinking at the time it was thunder, but minutes later, I stepped outside and was IUrpriaed to find the air was clear and there was no sign or rain. Back inside, the local television .tation was reporting news of the latest bomb to hit London. Any Londoner could recount that story. For two decades the Irish Republican Army has been run\u00ad ning a campaign of terrorist vio\u00ad lence on British soil -to 88y nothing of the ongoing violence in Northern Ireland between the opposing factions, and it shows little sign of abating. There is political deadlock on the issue and the bombe have become a part of , J.4)ndon life along with black taxi\u00ad cabs and homeless teen-agers. It was 20 years ago this March, foUr years after the outbreak of viblence in Ulster, when the IRA plJlced its first mainland bomb outside the Old Bailey Magistrates COurt. The '\"l'roubles ,\" as they are known, had come to mainland Britain. Since that day, when two IMlople were killed, the campaign hAs been conducted with \"arying degrees of intensity . In the past t\"o years the bombers have indulged themselves in one of their ni'ost active periods -it has been a t8ctically successful campaign. ;Last March, two incidents within hours of one another confirmed the niA's ability to strike at the heart of British life. First there was the Baltic Exchange bomb. A device ripped through the Baltic Exchange building, in the heart of London's financial district. Late on a Friday afternoon , the bomb did not catch the large numbers of people who worked in the area, but did claim the life of a young child and caused millions of dollars damage. Hours later, the largest bomb ever seen on British soil, exploded beneath the junction of the main road north out of London, closing the road network and destroying a nearby superstore. Thankfully, on this OCC88ion there were no deaths. There have been other targets too. At the height of the Persian Gulf War in 1991, when many Ameri\u00ad cans felt it unaafe to come to Europe for fear of attack from Middle East terrorist groups, the IRA was continuing its campaign . One attack came within inches of killing the prime minister and his Cabinet. Mortar shells launched from a van in Whitehall, a street near the prime minister's official residency, narrowly missed No. 10 Downing Street, and landed in the garden. Then there is the Tube, London's underground rail network, a favo\u00ad rite target. The Tube prides itself in getting Londoners to work every day. To attack one of the mainline stations is to effectively paralyze the whole system. Often a single station is closed as staff check out a suspicious package. The trains will pass straight through -the silence is almost overwhelming as passengers peer out onto the empty platform. Bombings still make the news. And the police efforts to trace the bombers continue. So it would be wrong to assume the bombings are forgotten. However, the ease with which the U.S. investigators arrested the World Trade Center bombers must have been met with some jealously from British coun\u00ad terparts. In Britain the security services are dealing with an orga\u00ad nization with a long-standing experience of terrorist activity. The atrocities are routinely con\u00ad demned and there are the occa\u00ad sional arrests, but bombings still continue. Politicians delight in calling the bombers cowards, although military experts privately acknowledge the expertise with which operations are conducted . To the outsider, why the British government has allowed such a situation to continue must seem bizarre. The issue is still discussed as the \"Irish problem,\u00b7 a term patronizing enough to add fuel to the fire. And the fact remains that the mainstream political parties offer little by way of different opinion on the issue. It has been left to ordinary people to stand against the terrorists . Just a few weeks ago two bombs exploded in Warrington, a small town between the cities of Man\u00ad chester and Liverpool. Two poys, one age 3, another 12, were killed when devices, placed in litter bins in a crowded shopping street exploded . It was not the first time bombs had been placed in a shopping district, nor was it the first time people had been killed in such incidents. What was different this time was the victims were so young. When War\u00ad rington buried its dead, the people of Britain and Ireland were shocked into action. Protest marches in Dublin and Belfast called for an end to the violence. Those with long memories were recalling similar efforts made 20 years previously when bombe began exploding in Belfast. Predic\u00ad tably, as the marches were taking place loyalist terrorists shot dead four Catholic workmen. Despite the violence, and contrary to some U.S. opinion, the sizeable Irish communities in London are not vilified for the actions of their countrymen. St. Patrick's Day is celebrated with the aame vigor it would be in other expatriate com\u00ad munities -and not just by the Irish. Let us not pretend for a moment that the situation in London is comparable to that in Sarajevo, Bosnia, or even Belfast, Northern Ireland. But London has become a city under seige, one to which people pay little attention. There is no one in London left untouched by the now infamous \"security alerts.\" Canceled or extended journeys and late arrivals are all part of everyday London life. Bombings, or more specifically bomb alerts, are such that they form part of the daily routine. The greatest danger is that the bombings have become routine and the public no longer feels they must ask why bombings continue. Bombs become just another hazard of life in a large city -an everyday danger like crossing the road - and when that happens the whole Irish issue is in danger of falling from the political agenda.

Ukraine claims arsenal not used for power Alan Cooperman Associated Press MOSCOW -Ukraine heatedly dellied Russian accusations that it was trying to become a nuclear power and said Tuesday it would t;lever play \"political games\" with the arsenal it inherited from the Soviet Union. International experts see little chance of a nuclear confrontation between the countries . But they are watching the rhetorical battle between Ukraine and Russia with growing concern. , At issue are nearly 2,000 war-heads that remained in Ukraine after the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union, which stored its nuclear weapons in four republics. Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan agreed last year to turn the nuclear weapons on their soil over to Russia or destroy them, but Ukraine has been backpedaling on that agreement. If Ukraine took full control of the weapons, it would instantly become the third biggest nuclear power in the world, behind the United States and Russia. The weapons now are maintained by Russian soldiers, under the unified command of the Common\u00ad wealth of Independent States, and are tied into an electronic network that the Soviets built to control all weapons from Moscow. On Monday, Russia accused Ukraine of violating agreements to get rid of its weapons and trying to \"widen the circle of nuclear pow\u00ad ers.\" Ukraine's Council of Ministers - the Cabinet -responded Tuesday by reaffirming its intention to become a nonnuclear state and calling Russia's accusation \"a per\u00ad version of Ukrainian position.\u00b7 Intpoducing ParadoJr lop Windows fASY.

But Sgt. Stacey Koon's attempt to contradict Officer Theodore Briseno's taped testimony from last year's state trial gave a prosecutor an opportunity to tell jurors a Briseno remark that had been edited out of the videotape -that he believed another officer was \u00b7out of control.\u00b7 Briseno broke ranks With his fellow policemen in the state trial, in which they were I .tted acqw on nearly all chargee. He joined their defense in the current trial on federal civil rights charges, and he didn't testify. Over defense objections, how\u00ad ever, the judge allowed prosecu\u00ad tors to play a videotape of Brise\u00ad no's state testimony, in which he said King wasn't a threat when he was beaten on March 3, 1991. Briseno also said he tried to stop Officer Laurence Powell from continuing to bash King with a baton. When Koon took the stand Tues\u00ad day, Assistant U.S. Attorney Ste\u00ad ven Clymer asked him, \"Didn't you write in your book that defendant Briseno gave an incor\u00ad rect motivation for trying to stop Powell?\" Koon, who has written a book about the beating. IBid he never accused Briseno of lying. \"And didn't he testify that he stopped Powell because he thought he was out of control'r' Clymer asked. \"That's what he said,-Koon said.

In the recent past, the easy availability (or what could be called open seating) of UISA senators was exploited by a self-appointed minority to pontificate on any social issue, regardless of importance to the UI. Too much time, money and energy bas been wasted arguing moot moral points. There are too many issues which affect students on a daily basis to allow this situation to continue. Every year the UISA decides budgeting issues which affect services such as student health care, oomputer availability, &\\FEWALK, whistlestop, and others. UISA senators also act as lobbyists when student issues rome before the state Legislature and at meetings of the Iowa state Board of Regents. These efforts could lead to better undergraduate education through increased stipends and training for teaching assistants and resident assistants. The current imbroglio over the definition of what constitutes a \"political group\" is purported to be an effort to focus debate on issues which affect students. Elimination of funding for all \"political\" groups would also serve to eliminate some of the forms of campus debate. It is interesting to note that the VISA was not included, ostensibly because various ideologies are represented . But the UISA also has been used as a political tool. One good example of this came last week, as the usual band of merrymakers decided that Iowa State student government's vote to \"Dump Pomerantz\" (32\"()'1) needed to be countered in the VISA, which also served to show loyalty to their mentor Terry Branstad. A clearer example of pure partisanship would be difficult to find. Ironically, members of the UCS and USS from the so-called liberal UI wanted to back Republican Marvin Pomerantz and counter the influence of \"conservative\" Iowa slate University , called \"cow college\" because of its agricultural cw-nculum. The effort failed in the Graduate and Professional Student Senate, however, which blocked final passage. Change comes incrementally . The UISA bas not yet achieved the Koala set when the new constitution was adopted, but it seems that over the past several years of bickering and infightilig some consensus has been achieved. The problems are well-known and solutions available. Hopefully, everyone in the VISA can come to ~ze this . .

Miranda sat on her ver\u00ad anda, watching the little blond neighbor boy run in the bean field with his golden retriever. He wore a red and white striped T-shirt and blue overalls. It was a Kodak moment. She leaned back on her white deck chair, purchased mail-order from Crate & Barrel (last season's), and sipped her iced tea. She was deep in love; what with the recent airing of the miniseries, \"Diana: Her True Story,\" and her third reading of \"The Bridges of Madison County,~ she bad a good feeling of what genuine, adulterous love was really like.

She quickly checks her hair with her hands, brushing ~er fingers over the large silver hoop earrinp she purchased last time she was in Des Moines. They make her feel younger, sexier. She wipes the iced-tea mustache off her upper lip and gazes toward the stranger. \"What can I do for you, mister?\" she manages to let loose in a 8ultry acream. Wait. She breathes in the unmistakable aroma of a car that meets strict California emissions standards.

There has never been a case in which the crime rate dropped due 1:4> gun-control laws, and there are many where the crime rate has increased : Washington , D.C., New York City and Southern California are but three examples.

Ch;arles Scott Iowa City Column contradictory To the Editor: I found Jim Rogers' column, 'Ven\u00ad geance is for God, not man, to Impart,\" to be full of contradictions. Given the problematic nature of the abortion debate, this Is not surpris\u00ad ing. What is troublesome, however, is that it seems that Mr. Rogers is not aware of the contradictions in the reasoning he employs in his article. Mr. Rogers starts off, gratifyingly enough, with his feelings of outrage over the fatal shooting of the Florida doctor by a person who he terms an \"extremist.\" It is good to hear this from someone who seems to con\u00b7 sider himself a conservative Christian (I'm making this assumption based on the phrase, \"many of my friends at other conservative and evangelical churches\"). This \"murder\" leads him to deal with the thorny question of how Christians stand in relation to secular authority. It is here that Mr. Rogers begins to contradict himself, a problem that engulfs his essay in the final four paragraphs. In the middle of his essay, Mr. Rogers begins by saying, \"from Moses to Paul, God has claimed the sole prerogative to punish: Yet in his next sentence he says, \"but God has not left his vengeance com\u00ad pletely for the world to come.\" Mr. Rogers exempts Christian magistrates, but this will not resolve the difficult ambiguity of this issue. His reasoning doesn't do justice to the response Jesus gave to the Pharisees and Herodians who tried to trick him by asking him, \"is it permissible to pay taxes to Ceasar or notl\" Jesus asked for a denarius, and asked them back, \"Whose head is this? Whose name?\" He then said, \"Give back to Ceasar what belongs to Ceasar -and to God what belongs to God: This is a complex reply, which raises more questions than it answers -what is Ceasar'sl What is God's? These questions have been at the heart of theological debate for centuries, a fact that Mr. Rogers does not seem to realize when he tries to tie up this question a linle too neatly. It Is a truism that one can find a biblical verse for just about anything. One can also find, quite readily, verses which contradict each other. Mr. Rogers unWittingly illustrates this when he uses 'Vengeance is mine, I will repay,\" in the same essay as \"Whoever sheds man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed, for in the image of God he made man\" (this last quote, oddly enough, prompts Mr. Rogers to say, \"this is civilization\"). He does not seem to sense the question that these two phrases spawn questions about the absence or presence of God in human affairs, nor, more impor\u00ad tantly, does he seem to realize that the Bible itself is a very contradictory document, and both proves and disproves when one uses it for argumentative purposes. Another point of contradiction : the fetus is an \"innocent species mem\u00ad ber.\" Mr. Rogers makes reference to the Fall. If the fetus is a human being, it is fallen, since it partakes of the original sin of Adam and Eve, and is no longer innocent. If it is not a human being, then it may well be innocent of original sin, but then prohibitions against the killing of \"innocent human -or innocent species member\" cannot be used, since nowhere does Mr. Rogers make it clear what the difference between what a \"human\" and what a \"species member\" is. Anti\u00ad abortionists have long tried to focus attention on the question of when a fetus can be considered human. I propose that what they are really doing is transporting the old idea of original sin into an area where it doesn't belong. The final, and most poorly rea\u00ad soned argument in Mr. Rogers' essay comes when he says \"that an anti\u00ad abortion comm itnnent logically entails opposition to the death pen\u00ad alty must be the most brainless equivalence in the current debate.\" Mr. Rogers' argument that some killing is \"for no good reason,\" while other killing is justified just does not fit with the title of his essay, nor with other of his phrases such as, \"how long, oh Lord, will you wait before you end the bloodshed 1\" His string of analogies that follow is puzzling, as is his earlier mention of the Old Covenant (which is itself directly refuted by Jesus in Matthew 5:38-39, \"You have leamed how it was said: Eye for eye and tooth for tooth. But I say this to you: offer the wicked man no resistance.\" Another lesson difficult to reconcile with all the murder and mayhem in the text that Jesus, at times, approved of; d, Matthew 5:17, among others). All in all, I was disappointed less by the contradictory nature of Mr. Rogers' article than his unwillingness or inability ro recognize these ambi\u00ad guities, and deal honestly with them.

Don't blame 'Big Brother' To the Editor: In response to Jeff Klinzman's article, \"Breaking wind in the Iowa Legislature\" (March 11 DO. I find Mr. Klinzman's article offen\u00ad sive, inaccurate and juvenile. The American political process does at times appear and act as if it had no grasp on reality. But to attribute this to conservative politics is ludicrous and naive. Apparently Mr. Klinzman is unaware that the Democratic Party has held majority control of this legislative process for many years. If he feels that the Deomocratic Party is too conservative, that is his right. But it does not justify the open-handed slap he has delivered to the Demo\u00ad cratic process, American policy and the judicial and correctional systems, America's judicial system is in no way perfect, but good, honest pe0- ple, our legislators, attempt to improve it constantly. This is not always accomplished . America's correctional system ~as roorn for improvement, but compar\u00ad ing it to South Africa and China is ridiculous. American prisoners have more civil rights than the supposedly free citizens of those countries. America's political process is far from perfect, but it is based on the will of the majority and as such is subject to error, This is no reason to scrap it. The keys to the problems Mr. Klinzman complains about are not blaming \"Big Brother\" like a five\u00ad year-old child, It is for individuals to take responsibility for their own actions. Poverty does not cause crime, it is a contributing factor, but people commit crimes. As such, people need to be responsible for these acts, not the government. Mr. Klinzman, grow up. America is not a cartoon, it is real life. Because of democracy you are able to express your opinions freely, as it should be. So go ahead and spend your time and effort criticiZing and complaining instead of doing some\u00ad thing constructive, the adult thing to do, taking responsibility for your actions and trying to make construc\u00ad tive changes. This is the right and responsibility of all living in our Democratic society. Kerry L. Werner Iowa City Whatever to do with one's number 6'51 To the Editor: As an Iowa Citian concerned ~about the environment and a recy\u00ad cler, I have been dismayed to find that when I go grocery shopping to buy meat or deli items (cole slaw, potato salad, etc.), I have to also buy a non recyclable container. For instance, I often shop at Hy-Vee, and their deli items come in either styrofoam or plastic. Although some The Daily Iowan -Iowa City, Iowa -Wednesday, April 7, 1993 -9A styrofoam products have a recycling symbol on them, I have yet to find a place that accepts used styrofoam, and I doubt that there are any anywhere -I think the symbol is a cosmetic ploy by the styrofoam industry. The Hy-Vee plastic contain\u00ad ers have a recycling symbol number 6 on them, but the only plastics that can be recycled in the Iowa City area are the number l's and number 2',. Can't our local grocery stores do better environmentallyl I know it's possible because the New Pioneer Co-op is able to avoid both of these types of containers in their deli and meat areas. Why does meat have to conne on a styrofoam platel It already has a pad to absorb liquids and is wrapped in plastic (bad enough). Wouldn't cardboard be sufficientl These may seem like petty matters, but mUltiplied by thousands of cus\u00ad tomers, it's a lot of unrecyclable waste. Please speak -or preferably write -to the managers of your local markets, asking them to eschew such packaging. Some of these stores already show sonne concern about the environment (Hy-Vee, for instance, recycles plastiC grocery sacks), but they could do much better. ,;aul Doupn Iowa City Mandated helmet use outrageous To the Editor: Are you a licensed motorcycle riderl Your editorial of March 10, 1993 in favor of Washington, D.C's mandated helmet laws, stated that your experience of falling off a three-wheeler, and also having fallen off motorcycles in the past made it stupid not to pass a helmet law. Were these occurrences on public highways or in your back yard (where the proposed law is not applicable)l Most three-wheelers were not licensed for highway use, and are therefore not germane, either physically or legally, to the discus\u00ad sion. Also, current laws do not keep you from wearing a helmet -on-or off-road. You DO currently have the right to choose. While I understand that the posi\u00ad tion of Managing Editor conveys with it an infusion of instant knowledge, along with the necessity of having something to print, I suggest that you might consider doing some home\u00ad work before putting your gratuitous, anecdotal pontifications in the paper. Iowa has the highest density of motorcycle ownership per 100,000 population of any state in the Union. Our elected Legislature is, in all likelihood, aware or this. It would appear, from initial figures available for the year 1992, that the death and injury rate in Iowa per mile traveled by motorcycle is equivalent or lower than that sanne rate for other vehi\u00ad cles. Mandated helmet use can place the rider in jeopardy from which the helmet cannot save his life. This is why so many of us motorcyclists are willing to pay to have the govern\u00ad ment's blackmail passed on us in the form of increased fees. It's not that we don't believe It to be outrageous, patronizing, paternal and unbelie\u00ad vably dictatorial; it's that we would rather pay the extra S 15 to keep some of our friends from being killed. Keith W. Dempster Past president, BMW Motorcycle Owners of America Past adviser Motorcycle Safety Foundation of America Readers treated to spectacle To the Editor: When departmental chair John Lyne points his finger in disapproval at The Daily Iowan's editorial staff for publishing some right-wing nonsense by John Ertz (MEditioral should not have been included,\" April 2), I've got to wonder what they are teaching in the Communi\u00ad cations Studies Building. I disapprove of Ertz's rantings too, but frankly expect linle better from the idiocy that passes for conserva\u00ad tive thought on this campus. There does exist a constituency for Mr. Ertz's brand of thinking. Thankfully, letters to this page have made a variety of points about the cruelty and immorality of his ill-conceived scheme. But to insist, as Lyne does, that such drivel has no place in the newspaper only reinforces the notion by the right-wing fringe that 'politi\u00ad cal correctness\u00b7 lives and prospers on this campus. The careful reader will find many instances of \"manifest ignorance\" on a stunning variety of subjects by editorial scribblers at this and other newspapers. Barring the publication of dumb or ignorant ideas would yield many empty pages. Thanks to Messers.

The \u00b7 Ruasians were victorious by a score ;0121-18, winning SD: of 10 matches in front of 6,233 fans. Yet Gable was more concerned with a victory of another sort - a victory for the sport of interna- tional freestyle \\freiItling. 'nternational wrestling is going to be on the upswing,\" Gable said. ! \"They're doing BOrne things now that are going to be positive in the ; future.\" One of those things was staging the USA\u00b7Russia World Dual, which gave Iowa fans a rare look at the -jina and outs of international frees- tyle.

They didn't plan John Shipley The Daily Iowan Iowa football is officially calling it Operation Bounce Back. The mission: rebuild a team that has l08t 29 players to graduation while at the same time improving on only the second losing season in 12 years . Coach Hayden Fry, the ex\u00b7Marine who single-handedly rebuilt Iowa's entire football program 14 years ago, thinks he has a secret weapon. Junior college transfers. The Big Ten relaxed its junior college transfer rule this seaBOn -and Fry took advantage. Iowa's staff lured 10 junior coUege trans\u00b7 fers to Iowa City for the 1993-94 season, with the promise of an immediate shot at cracking a depleted two-deep. For the first time in yean, the Big Ten will allow junior college trans\u00ad fers who qualify academically to play immediately. That gave Fry, whose team finished last season 5\u00b77, the opportunity to add BOme much\u00b7needed size and speed. -They're more mature than incoming freshmen; they've been playing college football for two years,\" Fry said. \"They can help us out more quickly than a kid out of high school.' Despite the new transfer rule, Iowa was the only Big Ten team to Fonner Hawkeye Tom Brands (right), representing the United Stales, and Russia's.

In the most hotly-contested bout of the evening, Brands overcame a three-point throw by Bagaudin Umakhanov. a 1993 World Cup titlist who had beaten Brands in both of their previous meetings.

I think we really scooped BOme of the other Big Ten schools. \"We offered them a chance to crack the two-deep right away; plus we've had very good success with the junior college transfers that we've had. That's how we BOld them.\" Joining the 10 transfers are 15 incoming freshmen, the most not\u00ad able of which is 8ettendorfrunning back Tavian Banks, whom the Hawkeyes lured away from Miami (Fla.) and Washington. _ The Hawkeyes will have to replace 12 starters and four firat-team all-Big Ten selections. Defensive tackle Mike Wells is the only returning all\u00b7Big Ten firat-teamer. -We were wiped out by gradua\u00ad tion,\" said Fry, whose 29 seniors last fall marks the largest gradua\u00b7 tion class in his 14 years at Iowa. Most of the damage was on offense. where Iowa lost nine star\u00b7 ters, including center Mike Devlin, tight end Alan Cross and offensive tackle Scott Davis, all of wbom were first-team Big Ten picks. Other losses of note include quar\u00ad terback Jim Hartlieb, tailback Marvin Lampkin, Iowan USA-Russia World Dual.

In a five-minute match, it's hard to come back down New Cubs bring new attitude Jay Nanda The Daily Iowan CmCAGO-Jim Lefebvre doesn't need anyone to remind his Cubs it's been 84 years since the North Siders won a World Series. But in case he ever gets the urge. the Cub manager can turn to a pair of seasoned veterans to make sure nobody forgets. Candy Maldonado and Willie Wil\u00b7 BOn are just two of 11 newcomers expected to make an impact on the 1993 Cubs, but perhaps more importantly, they each po88e88 the coveted championship ring. Lefebvre doesn't anticipate any miracles. But he is hoping the pairs succesa -and attitude - will rub off on the rest of the Cubs. ~ think the enthusiasm is there. These guys really appreciate being in a Cub uniform,\" Lefebvre says. -Changing the blood a little bit actually helps. I feel very positive about the guys we've brought in.- Maldonado signed with the Cubs in December after helping the Toronto Blue Jaya capture their first Wond Series last seaBOn. He hit .272 with 20 homers and 66 RBI for Cito Gaston's squad. Now just four months later, Maldonado finda himself in left field wearing a different type of blue. Maldonado's first and foremost thoughts are on tuting success again. And that means putting the team ahead of himself. \"We try to establish a new atmo\u00ad sphere,\" Maldonado saya. -Not only to be a team, but to be a family. There'l different names and different bodies. but at the lalDe time we all train for the same f 3-0. But you can't quit either.\" Moments later, Terry's brother Tom scored a 2\u00b70 overtime win against Gadji Rachidov, another Russian who won last weekend's World Cup in Chattanooga, Tenn. See WRESTLING, Page 29 Jose Guzman goal. \"That'8 what you need. You've got 25 people and you've got to put them together. But it takes a long time to put them. together. You don't build a team around one or two guys. It takes everybody to be involved.\" Thinga aren't as clear-cut for Wil\u00b7 BOn. One week after Maldonado joined the Cubs, the free agent donned Chicago pinstripes after an illustri\u00b7 ous 14-year career in Kanau City, where the Royals won a world title in 1985. He also spent the last two seasons in Oakland. His A's bowed to Maldonado's Blue Jays in the \u00b71992 American League Champion\u00ad &hip Seriea. At age 37, Wilson admit. ha's a bit apprehensive about being a leader on a new club. But he doesn't mind the challenge. -It's a lot different,\" says Wilson, who last seuon joined Hoqus Wag\u00ad ner, Lou Brock and Oaie Smith u See CUBS, Page 2B Montgomery and offensive linemen Mike Ferroni and Ted Velicer. 'This will be the most competitive spring camp we've had since rve been here, with the exception of the first year when we didn't know anything about the players,\u00b7 Fry said. On the offensive side, Iowa is most secure at wide receiver, where junior Harold Jasper and senior Jeff Anttila will split time at split end. Anthony Dean and Willie Guy will share wideout duties. Other than that, it's wide open. Fry called the quarterback race between seniors Paul Burmeister and Matt Eyde a toss-up, though See FOOTBALL, Page 28 SID Wine retires from post. John Shipley The Daily Iowan When people think of Iowa athletics, George Wine isn't a name that springs immediately to mind. In fact, many fans have prob\u00ad ably never heard the name before. But to media members and athletic departments all over the country, George Wine has been synonymous with the Hawkeyes for quarter of a cen\u00ad tury. For 25 years Wine has been the sports information director at Iowa and Tuesday he announced his resignation from that post. \"I've been thinking about this for a year. I just was ready to change direction a little bit,\" Wine said. -I've had this job for 25 years, I t!Unk that's probably long enough.\" Wine came to Iowa in 1968 after spending seven years at Northern Iowa and five at Mem\u00ad phis State. He is only the second pereon to hold the SID job at Iowa, succeeding the late Eric WilBOn, who created the job in 1924. \"I just hope I've left it in the same shape that he left; it for me,w Wine said of WilBOn. Wine will enter the Ul's phased'retirement program and work half\u00b7time in the men's athletic department. \"I basically wanted more flexi\u00b7 bility in my life,\" Wine said. \"I wasn't ready to fully retire. This is a good program because I wasn't ready to just quit. -I've been working for 37 years, which means I've been tied to a football or basketball team from September to the first week in April, which means I haven't had any weekends free. So I'm kind of looking forward to just driving up to Decorah and watching the leaves change color.- Wine, 61, has worked in the Iowa athletic department longer than any current employee. Under his direction, the SID office has received many awards and citations for publications and press bol[ service. \"We certainly want to congra\u00b7 tulate and thank George for the job he's done, particularly in football,\" Iowa football coach Hayden Fry said. -I feel a great 1088 in l08ing George.\" Wine, a native of North Engl\u00ad ish, is a ill graduate with a degree in journaliam. He is a past preaident of the College Sports Information Directors of America and a member of its Hall of Fame. In his 37 years he has seen coDege athletics, and the media that covers them, change dra\u00b7 matically. \"It's changed a lot, for two reasons, -Wine said. \"First the technology has changed. What you guys do is BO much different from the way we did it when I was at the Daily Iowan. We were working with hot type then. With computers and mod\u00b7 ems, a reporter doesn't even have to go to the office. '\"l'he other thinr is that the media in Iowa is lot more agreeaive than when I came here 25 years ago. 'llle only paper that really hustled news in those days was the De, Moine, RqiBter. The rest of them just sort of sat back and waited till we J handed them 8O.me newl and they'd printed.

We try to do and give them everything they need.\" Green Bay does not exactly fit one of White's criteria -his desire to help inner-city poor. However, he said during hie visit to the city that he would do work in Milwaukee if he decided on the Packers. The Packers, 9-7, last year, fit other criteria, however. They play on a grass field - White's preference -and improved dramatically last year from 4-12 under first-year coach Mike Holmgren. Green Bay, however, has strength\u00ad ened itself during free agency, signing nose tackle Bill Maaa from Kansas City and guard Harry Galbreath from Miami. With White joining Maaa on the defensive line, it should have a mlijor impact on a defense that ranked 23rd in the NFL last season. The Packers al80 traded on Mon\u00ad day for veteran quarterback Ken O'Brien from the New York Jeta to back up starter Brett Favre. Earlier Green Bay acquired run\u00b7 ning back John Stephens from New England to bolster ita running game. gles: White wasn't great loss Bernstein AsS(ICialted Press 1:.-____ --'1 .

White had a number of complaints \\bout the Eagles. He didn't like the way players were treated. He claimed the club deliberately pro\u00ad longed negotiations, forcing players to sign for le88 money. He didn't like the club's physical facilities . Braman cited aU these things as part of his decision not to offer White a new contract. After learning that White had agreed to play for Green Bay, the Eagles issued terY statements from Braman and club president Harry Gamble. \"I would be remiaa if I did not thank Reggie White for aU that he gave the Eagles' organization since 1985; Braman said. \"Aa for the future, I wish Reggie and his family all the beat.\u00b7 Gamble said: \"Firat of all; rd like to thank Reggie for all that he's done for the Philadelphia Eagles and wish him nothing but the best in the future. We certainly appreci\u00ad ate all that he baa meant to the Eagles in his eiJht yasons here. I believe his perfonnance on the football field and in the Philadel\u00b7 phia community speaks for itself. We wish Reggie and his family well.\" An Eagles spokesman said coach Rich Kotite wu not available Tues\u00b7 day. Mayor Ed Rendell, whose hopes that White and the Eagles could get together prompted a rebuke by Braman, said White called him soon after the Packers' announce\u00ad ment. The mayor said White plana to visit Philadelphia often in the off\u00b7season and continue to work with a city public housing project. \"He had always expressed a fear of being booed when he returned here, and I told him that he didn't have to worry about being booed - that the fans would never forget him,\" Rendell said. The nominal replacement for White appears to be Andy Harmon, a two-year player out of Kent State who played left tackle and backed up White. Harmon hu been cited by Kotite 88 potentially an out\u00b7 standing player. The coach said the 265-pounder has size and quick\u00ad ne88 that make him more suited for defensive end. White's departure means the Eagles in the lut two seasons have lost two of the best defensive players in the league. In June 1992, Pro Bowl defensive tackle Jerome Brown wu killed when he drove his car off a road in Brooks\u00b7 ville, Fla. Brown, White, Clyde Simmons and tackles Mike Pitta and Mike Golic had played 81 a unit since 1988. lSY to review gender equity j . ,~iated Press AMEs, Iowa -An Education spokelllWl AYI hopei to complete a review :! .. nder Iowa State ullivereity'l athletic thlI year. \\. uruvereltiea with .. athletic uami\u00ad-tion ri omce early \"l891 and the apncy \"hopei to ba~ done equity in uni\"reity pror' ~ la often referred to u TiUt IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.

Kevin Tapani's string of wins in borne openers ended at three. He allowed eight hits and nine runs, eight earned, in 3 1-3 innings as bia career ERA against Chicago ballooned to 6.69. The crowd of 51,617 demanded and received curtain calls from Puckett in the first inning and Winfield in the third after their homers rallied the Twins to a 4-3 lead. Winfield hu 1,009 extra\u00b7base hits, tied with Ernie Banks for 18th in history, and leads active major leaguers with 433 homera. But cheers quickly turned to grum. bles in the fourth. Robin Ventura and Ellis Burks singled, Lance Johnaon doubled in a run and Ron Karkovice walked before Ozzie Guillen's sacrifice fly put Chicago ahead. Raines sent Tapani's next pitch over the right\u00ad field wall for an 8-4 lead. Joey Cora then doubled, stole third and acored on reliever Mike Hartley's wild pitch.

He struck out nine and improved hie career record to 9-1. Wakefield, the recipient of the biggest pregame ovation from the sellout crowd of 44,103, proved just as confusing to Padres pitchers as he did to Padres hitters. The former minor.league first baseman went 2-for\u00b73 with a double and RBI to match his career hit total in one night.

Mark Lemke and pinch-hitter Francisco Cabrera led off the ninth inning with eaay outs. But Nixon, who made the final out of the 1992 World Series against Toronto, then singled to left field to deny the Cubs their first no-hitter since Milt Pappas beat the San Diego Padres on Sept. 2, 1972 at Wrigley Field. Guzman, signed as a free agent from Texas in December, bowed his head after Nixon's hit but then finished with a one-hitter for his fourth career shutout. Guzman agreed on Dec. 1 to a $14.35 million, four\u00b7year contract with the Cubs. He was 16-11 with a 3.66 ERA for the Rangers last season and spent most of the 1990 season undergoing rehab to his right shoulder. The earliest no-hitter in Jruijor league history was by Houston's Ken Forach against Atlanta on April 7, 1979. The Cubs, who were blanked in Monday's season opener 1-0 by Atlanta's Greg Maddux and Mike Stanton, acored in the first inning off loser John Smoltz Grace's offenaively inconsistent in both pmea and took a lot of time to make adjustments to the stylet of pitcbiDr. \"We can't upect to be productive takes to aeore a run,\u00b7 ahe said.

Hamer appeared destined to con\u00ad tinue the cyc:le of poverty and disenfranchiaement experienced by her parents and grandparents. Born in 1917, Ihe left school after only a few years to help her family pick cotton. This lack of formal education was not unusual among black women in the South at thia time, nor was her strong faith in God unusual. Yet. Fannie Lou Hamer was an unusual woman - she resolved to have justice for African-Americana, whatever the personal coat. She had grown up in an atmo\u00ad Iphel'fJ of racial terror. Lynchinga and rapes directed at blacks went unpunished. reminding them of their social vulnerability.

Film adaptation of 'little Nerno' lacks whirmcality of original strip T asha Robinson The Daily Iowan I admit that when I checked out \"Little Nemo: Adventure in Slum\u00ad berland,~ a new video release from Hemdale Pictures, I was hoping for another \"Ferngully\" or -Aladdin~ -an animated film pitched tow\u00ad ard children, out of an outdated idea that cartoons are strictly kiddie-fare, but nonethele88 appro\u00ad priate for and interesting to adults. After all, \"Nemo\u00b7 is based on the comic strip of almost the same name by turn-of-the-century car\u00ad toonist and animation pioneer \"Little Nemo in Slumber\u00ad land,\" first published in 1905, enjoyed immense popularity in America and Europe for its detailed drawing and highly whim\u00ad sical and fantastical elements. Read today, the formalistic style, the repetition and colloquialism of the dialogue combine to produce a style that seems very stilted, but the whimsy and creativity that fascinated readers nearly a century ago are still present in abundance. The film version of \"Nemo\" does a suitable job of updating the charac\u00ad ters and dialogue, but lOBeS some of the unique quality of McCay's work by sticking too closely to one plot line. The comic strip featured a little boy named Nemo making nightly trips to Slumberland to play with King Morpheus' daughter and the miachlevious Flip -trips that Nemo inevitably ended by getting too excited and either falling out of bed or waking himself up. His adventures had a distinctly malleable quality, as one dream would fade quickly into another; a palace would become a forest, a tiny town become huge, etc. -usually just when Nemo thought things were getting inter\u00ad esting. The movie, on the other hand, misses out on this protean style; with the exception of an exciting opening sequence and one quick journey Nemo and Flip take together, the Slumberlandscape is mostly static, based on a tingle plot thread -there's an evil monster called Nightmare loose, and it's Nemo's job to stop it. \"Nemo\" is a colorful, richly ani\u00ad mated film, filled with familiar visual references from sources ranging from -Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" to ~e Wizard of Oz. ~ (Apparently the animators were delving in Disney's files as well-Nightmare is a dead ringer for the \"Night on Bald Mountain\" demon from \"Fanta\u00ad sia,\" whereas Princess Camille looks oddly like -Aladdin~ 's Prin\u00ad ce88 Jasmine, and many of the swooping . flying-bed scenes look like -Aladdin\"'s dizzying flying\u00ad carpet chases.) But the plot is more reminiscent of \"The Never-Ending Story\" -young girl draws young boy into fantasy world, where he is sent upon a grand quest to Save Everyone . It's definitely the stuff dreams are made of -at least, the dreams of young children. What \"Nemon lacks is the broader humor or character development that would endear it to adults as well as children. It's well-drawn, it's cute, but it's not particularly compelling, in part because it takes so long to get to the point and bring up the conflict. The combat with Nightmare features some wonderful animation and dizzying camera movement , but it's the exception to the rule and the break in a long series of cheery vignettes, which come complete with sudden bursts of song and dance. Fans of Dimey's last few movies won't find an alternative in \"Nemo. n But children, at least, are likely to find an enduring and exciting story that's as familiar as their own dreams.

Her column runs Wednesdays in the Arts Enter\u00ad tainment section. Vampiric 'Hunger' avoids overbite of Coppola's excessive 'Dracula' T asha Robinson The Daily Iowan It would be difficult to believe that Francis \"sometimes I have a middle name, sometimes I don't~ Coppola didn't to some degree pattern his -nracula\" after the 1983 vampire film -rile Hunger,\" directed by Scott (~op Gun~ -nays of Thunde~) and play\u00ad ing tonight through Friday. \"Dracula\" strove for -Hunge~ 'I quiet, tense tone and erotic flavor, but. Coppola's humongous budget and directoral eueasee killed any such chances. It's too bad, because \"The Hunge~ 'I many strengths comple\u00ad ment -Dracula~ 'I handful of uaeta fairly well. ~unge~ stars recent Oscar nominee Catherine Deneuve as an ancient and grasp\u00ad ingly lonely vampire with a taste for the elaborate and beautiful, aa seen in her relationship with le88- ancient consort David Bowie. The pair spend their nights lurking in nightclubs, using their own beauty and lexual power aa bait for other attractive young people, who end up as hot lunches. But when the spell on Bowie beginI to fade and his age catches up with him, Deneuve decidea to seduce lCientist (and another recent Oscar nomi\u00ad nee) Susan Sarandon to the world of vampiric glamour, leX and mur\u00ad der. Like \"Dracula,\u00b7 -rhe Hunge~ ia a wildly uneven film, cOntaining both sublimely erotic and heavy, stylistically overdone sequences. The opening montage il choppy and ~ointed. The actual shots awitch rapidly from Bauhaus' Peter Murphy singing and lurching in the club to Deneuve and Bowie making their lateat conquest to ~ cloae-ups of a monkey tearing his mate apart. Despite the plot signi\u00ad ficance of the latter two events, the scene is virtually impouible to follow, at least the first time through. The scene is set to the driving rock anthem \"Bela Legoej's Dead,\" which lOme sadly confused editor slicee into segments, break\u00ad ing up the rhythm of the song with gaping, inappropriate periods of silence. David BowIe forming from prim to wanton at the drop of a hat. Bowie, while a relatively minor character after the first 20 minutes, is suitably dry and powerful as Deneuve's lover / victim. Between the confusing beginning and the final scenes, ~unge~ is a graphic adult look at power and lust by way of a study in transfor\u00ad mations -youth to lIP, beauty to ugliness, strength to weakness, aggre88ivene88 to p888ivity, inno\u00ad cence to decadence, the mundane to the supernatural . In this vein, the film fulfills its every promise, exploring the characters thoroughly and in detail. It's only at the very end, which is overburdened with gory special effects and horror-film standbys, that the story's beauty and eerie grace degenerates into something less intense and more common. Of the two films, \"Dracula\" isle88 demanding and easier to watch, but is also leas complex, suffers from casting problems, and has quite a bit more dross that could be removed. (Keanu Reeves being high on the list.) ~unge~ has a fitting cast and only briefly suffers from directoral ego, but does dis\u00ad play lome flawl \u00b7Dracula~ got around, IUch as confusing editing and a limited budget.
