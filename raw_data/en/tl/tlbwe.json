Esp the evidence from the experiments of Dr Edward Jenner. In 5th edition - aph 46 In 6th edition -foot note to aph 56 POST-HAHNEMANNIAN CONCEPT DR BURNETT. Vaccinosis- Book by J Compton Burnett vaccination can profoundly disturbing and lasting influences on the health of the susceptible individuals. Many cases are dramatically benefited by the administration of potentized preparation of the particular vaccine used. Best of Burnett Protective power of vaccination is due to a diseased state of the body. Vaccinate may not be ill in ordinary sense but must be in a subdued morbid state. In an article published in South England Journal revealed after continuous researches the area where too much vaccination is given for Pox disease, that particular area of the world shows increased prevalence of AIDS. GEORGE VITHOULKAS Science of Homoeopathy Without considering the individuality,Concept of vaccination is exactly opposite to the principles of Homoeopathy. STUART CLOSE Vaccines creates only a spurious immunity with destruction of the normal susceptibility. It sets up a morbid condition instead of a healthy one with degeneration of the physical plane. H A ROBERT Using disease tissue is isopathy, not homoeopathy, and thus using vaccine is not an example of the law of similars in action, but the law of identicals or isopathy R E DUDGEON In the recent times attempts were made to discover prophylactics First vaccine- vaccine against small pox by Jenner in 1798 The first and most celebrated prophylactic was discovered by Dr Hahnemann, the preventive of scarlet fever BELLADONNA He reasoned a remedy that is capable of checking a disease at its onset must be its best preventive. Belladonna is a medicine that was found to be capable of curing scarlet fever in its early stage. HERING Dr Hering in 1830 suggested that the preventive of many diseases in their morbid products. Eg: the saliva of a rabid dog might be prophylactic for hydrophobia, epidemic and miasmatic diseases found their prophylactic in their own seeds. TREATMENT FOR VACCINOSIS Vaccines are indiscriminately administered to everyone regardless of state of health or individual sensitivity. For the treatment of vaccinosis it is better to administered 1st a constitutional remedy which is truly indicated to the case. Vaccinosis is a set of symptoms like other disease condition and as such is to be dealt like other cases in homoeopathy. ANTIM TART: bad effects of vaccination when Thuja failed and Silicea not indicated. Drowsiness, debility and sweat are the characteristic symptoms of the drug. BELLADONNA: erythema, indurations and nodule formation after vaccination. High fever with convulsion, redness and hot face. MEZERIUM: eruption after vaccination, eczema with intolerable itching, ulcer formation which is surrounded by vesicles and shiny red areola. Eruption ulcerates and forms thick scabs under which purulent matter emits. SARASAPARILLA: eruption following hot weather and vaccination. Urinary complaints after vaccination. SEPIA: easy fainting , falling of hair, herpis circinatus,urticaria, icthyosis with offensive odour of skin. SILICEA: bad effects of vaccination especially abscess formation and convulsions. Quincy, keloid growth, epilepsy. Inflammation swelling ansuppuration of various glands of the body. SULPHUR: stalwarts of homoeopathy have agreed with Burnets view. According to him Thuja is a very efficatious remedy for for the treatment of vaccinosis. If the pt says 'I have never been well since I have vaccinated'- then we think first of Thuja. Multiple flat or pedenculated warts, spongy tumours, rapid emaciation of Hahnemann's sycosis. Neuralgia inveterate skin eruptions, indigestion with great flatulent dyspepsia MALANDRINUM: ill effects of vaccination. Efficatious in clearing of the remnants of cancerous deposit. Dry scaly skin with itching. VARIOLINUM : used for internal vaccination. Headache,deafness and excruciating back ache, hot fever anf profuse bad smelling sweat etc. Anti miasmatic remedy Useful after complex diseases arising after vaccination. In spite of proper treatment cure is impossible unless suitable anti miasmatic remedy is administered. CONCLUSION If we see from the statistical point of view in spite of the bad effects of vaccination sometimes it shows its effectiveness since Hahnemann's time. Small pox have now been totally eradicated due to the effectiveness of vaccination. Poliomyelitis, diphtheria and other childhood diseases are gradually decline from time to time. We as a homoeopath can successfully prevent infectious diseases by our non toxic genuine Homoeopathic drugs "}
