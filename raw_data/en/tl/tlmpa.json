Kamehameha I, powerful chief of the island of Hawai'i, successfully defeats rivals and establishes himself as sc'tiereign over all Hawai'i. He unites a scattered nation and keeps it together in the face of vast cultural changes due to the arrival of foreign ships bringing animals, trees, fruits, plants, firearms, liquor, and diseases never before seen in Hawai'i.

Later he orders religious images burned and heiau demolished, thus irrevocably tearing the ancient social fabric of the islands. He dies from measles in London in 1824. 1820. American Protestant missionaries from New England arrive in Hawai'i. Although primarily interested in the salvation of souls, they are an important catalyst of civilization.

Soulli&re, Laura E. Notes from architectural survey, 1976, in NPS files, DSC. xxxi PREFACE Perhaps few groups of Hawai'ian people have been as analyzed and described as the residents of Kalaupapa settlement, a colony for leprosy patients established in the nineteenth century on the north shore of the island of Moloka'i. While previous studies have been primarily sociological in nature, concentrating on the plight, problems, and concerns of these people, this Historic Resource Study of Kalaupapa National Historical Park has been written for two rather different reasons. First, the area is new to the National Park System, and although its general development has been traced in standard Hawai'ian histories, much of the detail necessary for proper park management, interpretation, and preservation has been lacking. The park contains an amazing variety of prehistoric archeological ruins and historic buildings at scattered locations across the peninsula and in varying states of deterioration. Establishing priorities for stabilization, restoration, interpretation, and adaptive use requires the collection and evaluation of all data necessary to establish levels of significance. Second, the National Park Service is mandated by E.O. 11593, the National Historic Preservation Act Amendments of 1980, Service Management Policies, and by former Director Russ Dickenson's Staff Directive 81-I to identify significant resources and thus avoid the potential for serious adverse effects on them. This meant that all 400+ public buildings, support facilities, patient homes, and miscellaneous structures on the peninsula had to be studied. This study provides a narrative history of the Kalaupapa peninsuJa on Moloka'i, beginning with the arrival of leprosy patients in 1866. Perusal of kingdom and territorial records has provided minute details on the early Kalawao and Kalaupapa settlements, and Board of Health records for later years provide plentiful data on later rehabilitation work at Kalaupapa settlement. The information found in these primary sources has been supplemented by many useful secondary sources, maps, and photographs. .-. XXXlll The National Park Service is now involved in making decisions on stabilization and restoration work, so that much of the study emphasizes construction dates and building use in order to determine levels of significance of sites and structures. Less emphasis has been put on oral history research, although hopefully this report provides an historical context which can be enhanced by oral history and which will place the statements of informants in their proper perspective. It should be noted that the chronological divisions the writer has established to describe the physical growth of the leprosy settlement vary somewhat from those in the 1975 National Register form, because it is believed these more accurately reflect the course of development. The building construction dates in the final evaluation and recommendations chapter were found in the Department of Health Administrator's office at Kalaupapa settlement, in a document entitled \"Memorandum No. 76-12 re: Verification of State Owned, leased, and rented buildings on Molokai,\" May 1976, and from a facilities inventory of August 1980. Sometimes these dates vary a year or so from those given in Board of Health reports. Building numbers throughout are keyed to the aerial photograph of Kalaupapa settlement found in Laura E. Soulliere and Henry G. Law's architectural evaluation of Kalaupapa settlement published by the National Park Service in 1979 and reprinted in this document as Historical Base Map 8. Writing this report has been a wonderful experience, opening up a whole new research field for this historian. Personnel at the Hawaii State Archives in Honolulu, especially Mary Ann Akao andi Richard Thompson, were extremely helpful and patient during my numerous requests for research help and for xeroxing and photographic services. I would also like to thank Charles Okino of the State Department of Accounting and General Services; Irene Letoto of the Damien Museum and Archives; personnel of the Bishop Museum; Barbara E. Dunn of the Hawaiian Historical Society; Mary Jane Knight of the Hawaiian Mission Children's ~ Society Library, Brother John McCluskey of Chaminade University of Honolulu, and personnel of the State Department of Health in Honolulu. Invaluable and constant help was extended by Anwei V. Skinsnes of the 1 xxxiv Leprosy Atelier of Leahi Hospital and by Bruce J. Doneux of the Kalaupapa Historical Society and project director of the Kalaupapa Historical Collection Project. Toshiaki I nouye, state administrator at Kalaupapa, was friendly, courteous, and most helpful in putting his records at my disposal. And finally I would like to thank all the patients at the settlement who accepted me graciously and expressed interest in my work. The primary National Park Service representative at the settlement is Henry G. Law, who functions as superintendent, tour guide for Service VIP visitors, liaison with the patients, NPS spokesman, and general factotum. A more personable, responsible, and competent person could not have been selected for this post. Henry's interest in just about everything and everybody and his sincere dedication to the National Park Service mission make working with him a most enjoyable experience. Also appreciated for their help and interest in this project are Bryan Harry, Pacific Area Director, NPS, Honolulu, and his staff archeologist Gary F. Somers. Several people at the Denver Service Center of the National Park Service helped prepare this report for publication. I would especially like to thank Nancy Arwood, Lou Tidd, Jan Petrukitas, and Joan Manson for their expert typing of the text and John Myers for his meticulous mapwork. Finally I would like to thank Tom Mulhern, Chief, Park Historic Preservation, and Gordon Chappell, Regional Historian, National Park Service, Western Regional Office, for their encouragement, assistance, and unfailing interest in this project. They, as well as all Park Service visitors to the peninsula, have been greatly impressed by the friendliness of the people, the magnificence of the scenery, and the international significance of the area. Kalawao and Kalaupapa settlements stand today as monuments to man's ability to overcome spiritually and physically one of the most distressing public health problems in world history. Their importance lies in their relationship to major historical themes, such as general community 0 values and past and future public and mental health research and attitudes. The history of the Kalaupapa peninsula leprosy patients is an xxxv integral part of the story of the Hawai'ian Islands and of leprosy in Hawai'i and the world. The disease was still a mystery in the nineteenth century. No one understood its origin, methods of transmission, or cure. Isolation was still the most common form of treatment to try to prevent the spread of the disease. In the belief that leprosy was incurable, patients were abandoned in colonies, usually with only missionaries to look after their welfare. The kingdom of Hawai'i, which recognized the epidemic proportions of leprosy and was originally faced with the problem of stemming its spread in the islands, charted an unknown course in the care and treatment of leprosy patients. With a continuing financial committment to the project and with the aid of dedicated clergy of several faiths and other selfless individuals, the government of Hawai' to gradually improve the lifestyle and medical treatment unfortunate individuals. 'i was able of these Biblical references to leprosy greatly influenced Western attitudes toward the disease and created the stigma for its victims of being unclean and morally impure. Because of its unfortunate connotations, leprosy has sometimes been referred to as \"Hansen's Disease,\" after Gerhard H .A. Hansen, discoverer of the leprosy bacillus. Because the word \"leprosy\" has been in use for so many years, the International Leprosy Association still condones its use, although the objectionable term \"leper\" is avoided. It cannot, however, be expunged from the historical record and will occasionally be used in this study in direct quotations. The remaining patients at Kalaupapa are special and their experiences as leprosy victims are unique. Their history is a record of the human experiences of a very special population--a population who because of their disease and because of the public reaction to their disease have lived lives that the rest of us haven't. What we learn from this record of human experience will at its best serve to enrich our own lives and those of the generations succeeding us. We will learn to be exceptionally sensitive to the idea of social banishment; we will learn, above all, that human dignity is worth preserving. 1.

A Brief Historv of the Hawai'ian Islands A. \"Discovery\" The Hawai'ian archipelago is a chain of eight major islands plus reefs and shoals extending southeast-northwest, from Hawai'i, the \"Big Island, \" to Kure Island--a distance of 1,600 miles. Exclusive of Midway Islands, which remain under U.S. Navy administration and have long been an important airplane base, the seven inhabited islands are at the southeast end of the archipelago. Extending from the northwest to the southeast, they are Ni'ihau, Kaua'i, O'ahu, Moloka'i, LZna'i, Maui, and island south of LZna'i, is uninhabited and used as a target area by the U.S. Navy and Air Force. The Hawai'ian Islands were formed by volcanic action, the major ones being basaltic volcanic domes. The Hawai'ian Islands were originally settled by peoples given the general name of Polynesians, who came from the Marquesas and Society islands by canoe over a long period of time, beginning probably at least as early as the eighth century A. D. Emigrants later came in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries from Tahiti. Although Spanish galleons sailing between Mexico and the Philippines might have been aware of this group of islands, not until 1778 did the first European, the British explorer Capt. James Cook, \"discover\" the islands on his third expedition to the Pacific, in search of a sea passage joining the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. He named them the Sandwich Islands in honor of his patron, the Earl of Sandwich, First Lord of the [British] Admiralty. Returning the next year, Cook was killed in a skirmish with a group of native Hawai'ians on the \"Big Island\" of Hawai'i. At the time of Cook's discovery, the individual islands or parts of islands were ruled by various high chiefs, who constantly quarreled among themselves for supremacy. Finally a particularly capable chief on the island of Hawai'i, named Kamehameha, eventually conquered all the islands and brought them under his ordered and prosperous rule by 1810. (Although he did not invade the islands of Kaua'i and Ni'ihau, their king accepted Kamehameha as his sovereign. ) Except for a few minor and unsuccessful revolts, there were no more wars in Hawai'i. Kamehameha 1 devoted the next few years to organizing his government and building up the islands' resources, and the single unified kingdom thrived during his stable reign. During that time many Europeans, and a few Americans, lived in Hawai'i. Indeed white men had helped Kamehameha in his conquest to a great extent, providing him with guns, artillery, and ships. Kamehameha I ruled from 1795 to 1819 and was referred to as \"the Napoleon of the Pacific.\"' He is most commonly referred to, however, as Kamehameha The Great, because of his achievements in uniting a nation and keeping it together in the face of disruptive foreign and domestic elements. Upon his death, the King's heir, Liholiho, became Kamehameha I I. B. Arrival of Protestant Missionaries On June 27, 1810, in Bradford, Massachusetts, an American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions was instituted, whose object was \"to devise, adopt, and prosecute ways and means for propogating the gospel among those who are destitute of the Knowledge of Christianity. \"2 Its members belonged to the Congregational and Presbyterian churches. When American Protestant missionaries came to Hawaii in 1820, they encountered the old Hawaiian religion, which included four primary gods and several lesser ones. Despite its support by Kamehameha the Great, the Hawaiian religion had been growing weaker for some time due to the influence of foreigners, as well as the natives tiring of the sacrifices and oppression imposed by priests. The kapu or taboo system was an extremely important part of this religion and prescribed numerous prohibitions, such as forbidding men and women from eating together and 1. Omer Englebert, The Hero of Molokai: Father Damien, Apostle $! the Lepers (Boston: Daughtersof-St. Paul, 1962), p. 58. 2. Father Reginald Yzendoorn, History g the Catholic Mission in the Hawaiian Islands (Honolulu, T. H. : Honolulu Star-Bulletin, Ltd., -271, p. 21. 2 women from eating specific foods such as bananas, pork, coconuts, or certain fish, Two of Kamehameha the Great's widows, however, were instrumental in overthrowing the kapu system. These two women persuaded Liholiho to abolish the old kapu and the old religion. Throughout the islands images of the old gods were destroyed, heiau demolished, and the people forbidden by royal decree to worship the old gods. Hawai'i thus became a fertile field for American evangelism and the planting of new religions. Although the old patterns of domestic and religious life were disrupted, it was years before a new pattern, based on Christian mores, was established. King Kamehameha II permitted the missionaries to settle and work in Hawai'i for a year, and during that time they zealously established and operated schools on O'ahu, Kaua'i, Hawai'i, and Maui. New arrivals from Massachusetts achieved further admirable results--establishing a Hawai'ian alphabet, introducing a written Hawai'ian language, and publishing several Hawai'ian word lists and religious booklets in Hawai'ian. Pleased with their successes and gradual acceptance by many of the chiefs, the Protestants were unwilling to permit competition from other quarters. Some dissension arose, therefore, in 1827 when the first Catholic missionaries arrived and attempted to counterbalance the influence of the New Englanders. C. Arrival of Catholic Missionaries and Others In 1825 the Seminary for Foreign Missions in Paris entrusted the Hawai'ian Mission to the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary and of Perpetual Adoration of the Most Blessed Sacrament of the Altar, an order founded in 1800 and sometimes referred to as the Picpus Brothers after the street in Paris on which the mother house was located. The brothers found their presence in Hawai'i in 1827 to be unwelcome; the chiefs, influenced by the Protestant missionaries, were reluctant to admit Catholics to Hawai'i. Eventually granted a tract of land for their mission by Kamehameha I I I (Kamehameha I I had died of measles in London in 18241, the Catholics settled in to learn the language. In 1831, however, persecution of the Catholics began, with the connivance of the 3 Protestant mission. The Prefect Apostolic of Hawai'i was banished. The brothers who remained endeavored during this time to console and encourage the faithful Hawai'ians who still gathered at the mission for daily prayers. In mid-1835, the arrival of more Boston missionaries initiated a new persecution of Catholics on Oahu. In Honolulu harsh and cruel punishments were meted out to Catholic Hawai'ians who refused to attend Protestant prayer meetings. Hundreds were imprisoned and forced to hard labor. In December 1837, by royal ordinance, the Catholic faith was rejected and Calvinist tenets became the state religion. Only with the arrival of a French frigate in the Honolulu harbor in 1839 and the subsequent demand to halt all persecution under threat of war were orders given by the king and chiefs to end all punishments based on religious beliefs and to liberate all Catholic prisoners. The first written constitution of the kingdom, published in 1840, contained a clause on religious toleration. The way was then cleared for inauguration of a full-scale apostolate throughout the islands, although open hostility between Protestants and Catholics continued. By 1840 Catholics numbered 2,000, and five years later the islands were elevated to a Vicariate Apostolic of which Bishop Louis Maigret was placed in charge. By Brother Damien's arrival in Hawai'i in 1864, there were already forty Catholic missionaries in the field. Little by little the relations between Catholic priests and Protestant ministers became friendlier, and, as a consequence, Catholic relations with the king and chiefs also improved. Now the work of extension could begin. The Hawaiian Evangelical Association was organized in 1854, superseding the Sandwich Islands Mission, and in 1863 the association broadened its membership to include native Hawai'ian clergy. Mormon missionaries arrived in the islands in the 185Os, and Episcopalians in the 1860s. The Hawai'ian kingdom thus became a predominately Christian nation, watched over closely by missionaries --the only foreigners in the early days who concerned themselves solely with the fate of the Hawai'ians. D. A New Era Begins Up to the time of Cook's arrival in the Hawai'ian Islands, centuries of nearly complete isolation had evolved a pattern of Hawai'ian 4 social and cultural life shaped from internal forces. By the mid-nineteenth century, economic and social change was rapid and prompted primarily by external forces. Only a few years after Cook's visit, the Sandwich Islands became a convenient port in which foreign ships could rest and obtain supplies during the long trans-Pacific voyage involved in bearing sea otter skins between the northwest coast of America and Canton, China. Soon a variety of exploring vessels, whaling ships, and general trading ships anchored off the coast, and a friendly and profitable relationship developed between the seamen and the Hawai'ians. Firearms and ammunition were given to the chiefs for use during their frequent civil wars and sailors enjoyed in return 'fresh water, sweet potatoes, pork, and the charms of the island women. It was not long before several of these seafaring visitors decided to live onshore, and this number grew steadily. These new residents ranged from runaway sailors and escaped prisoners to men of education and practical knowledge. The latter were in great demand by the chiefs as instructors in war, advisors, and managers of estates. Held in high esteem, they became quite wealthy and prominent. Very few of the foreigners, however, made any attempt to educate the natives or teach them the intricacies of Western culture, probably to ensure the stability of their own positions. Although at first primarily Europeans and Americans, foreign residents included Chinese by 1794, and before long Hawai'i was assuming her role as the melting pot of the Pacific. Foreign contacts brought many positive results, such as new ideas; new domestic animals, plants, fruits, and vegetables; and items of European manufacture, such as tools and utensils. In addition they created a variety of new problems, involving religious conflicts, land titles, trade, and credit. The most detrimental effect of foreign influence was the introduction of venereal and other diseases to the islands. Having no immunity to them, thousands of Hawai'ians became afflicted with venereal disease and succumbed to smallpox, measles, and whooping cough. 5 II. Leprosy Through the Ages A. History of Leprosy The disease of leprosy has been a scourge of mankind for thousands of years. Through the centuries it has been one of the most dreaded of diseases because of its disfiguring and incurable aspects. First known in Egypt, it did not spread to Europe proper until after the Romans invaded Egypt several hundred years before Christ. While Phoenecian seamen probably spread it to Greece and Mediterranean ports, Roman soldiers brought it back to Italy and then farther into Europe. Occurrences of the disease increased rapidly in England and it became a plague during the Crusades when the warriors brought back enough of the deadly germs to start epidemics. During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the disease assumed terrible proportions with possibly a quarter of northern Europe's population being afflicted at one time.' Flourishing in the filthy, congested towns of that period, it hit the lower classes hardest, but sometimes could be found in the highest social strata, including sovereigns and clerics. Although there were physicians available, such a serious ailment as leprosy was considered to be an expression of the wrath of God and was left to the ministrations of priests. Segregation seemed the solution to combat the contagiousness of the disease, whose cause, communicability, or cure were unknown. Throughout history those who have contracted leprosy have undergone extreme hardships. A state of outlawry, worse than that of a criminal, was thrust upon them. Regarded as already dead, the sick were cast out of the cities and forbidden to mingle with the healthy folk. Hampered by strict rules governing their movements, leprosy victims were forced to subsist as beggars, wearing a black cowl and announcing their presence by constant tragic cries of \"Unclean! 'I At that sound, the unscathed would make the sign of the cross and flee or drive the outcast away with stones. 1. John Farrow, Damien the Leper (New York: Sheed & Ward, 1951), p. 89. It was through the unceasing labors of the priesthood that the lives of leprosy victims were finally made more bearable. Hospitals (leprosaria) and houses were established to feed and clothe the sick. The arrival of another epidemic disease during the Middle Ages--the Black Plague --caused sudden mortality among the general population, but specifically annihilated leprosy victims, who, already weakened, were extremely prone to contracting the plague. By the time the plague ceased in Europe at the end of the fifteenth century, it had decimated the leprous population. After this the incidence of the disease in Europe declined, due to rising standards of living, heightened resistance and immunity, and stricter health precautions. From the fifteenth century to Damien's time little progress was made in the welfare of those afflicted with leprosy. Most of the lazar houses were closed after the plague subsided and those that remained were turned over to civil authorities and became pestholes. Although medical science continued to advance, there was little improvement in hospitals where the few leprosy victims remaining were doomed to die in a grim life imprisonment. There these forgotten people were forbidden any of the amenities of the living. Objects of repulsion, feared by all, they were constantly reminded that the sooner they died the better. Such was the shocking state of most of the world's leprosy institutions when in 1873 Father Joseph Damien de Veuster, a Belgian priest, landed on the rocky beach of one of the world's most notorious lazarettos--the Kalaupapa leprosy settlement on the island of Moloka'i in Hawai'i. B. Cause and Manifestations of the Disease 1. Discovery of the Bacillus and its Communicability Leprosy, or Hansen's Disease as it is sometimes called, is caused by a bacillus. Dr. Gerhard Henrik Armauer Hansen, a Norwegian physician, first detected the rod-shaped bodies in leprous nodules that became known as Mycobacterium leprae in 1873. The disease is only mildly contagious and not easily communicated to others, but when it does spread it seems to usually be by prolonged intimate contact. However, it is often not transmitted to a spouse by an infected partner and is not directly inherited. Only a small percentage of children living intimately with the disease will develop it, and of those that do, often their own body defenses will overcome it. Young children are more susceptible to the disease than adults. The likelihood of infection is dependent upon the amount of infection one is exposed to. Many people seem to have a natural immunity to leprosy; the lack of such immunity is probably the most determinant factor in transmission. 2 2. Forms of the Disease The first signs of leprosy are detected as changes in the skin, mucous membranes, or the peripheral nerve system, caused by invasion of these tissues by the bacilli. Skin changes involve the appearance of a non-itching spot or variety of spots on any part of the skin. These spots show a change in sensation; there may be a loss of sweating and absence of hair growth in the center of the spot. Thickening of certain nerves follows. Later, in certain types of the disease, nasal stuffiness or hoarseness may occur. The eyes may also be affected at this early stage. The extent of signs of the disease is influenced by the amount of resistance. If body defenses cannot completely combat the bacilli invasion at this point, a tuberculoid type of leprosy may develop. A more serious lepromatous type will progress if there is little or no resistance by the body's immune system. A middle course of the disease is known as borderline type. 3 Leprosy is not in itself usually fatal, but the individual will succumb to some other sickness due to his weakened condition. a. Lepromatous Leprosy Lepromatous and tuberculoid types differ in their progress. The former is characterized by early skin changes and later, 2. Oliver Hasselblad, Hansen's Disease: & Present 3. Ibid., pp. 3-4. 9 less prominent nerve changes. First, nodules, or swelling sores, appear in various locations, which slowly increase in size and number. The upper respiratory system is also affected, as are the eyes, and changes can occur in certain viscera such as the liver and spleen. Nerve changes can appear later in the form of periodic fevers. Patients sometimes die during these periods, while in others a period of stagnation may be followed by recurrences of fever. Anesthesia or loss of sensation occurs. Untreated Iepromatous leprosy lasts on the average eight to ten years. b. Tuberculoid Leprosy In tuberculoid leprosy, nerve changes dominate the disease manifestation, while skin changes appear only as spots. First, pain and fever episodes occur and during these attacks brownish patches appear on the skin, lasting from a few days to years, and can disappear and reoccur . Ultimately the peripheral nerve branches and main trunk are attacked , with accompanying pain, paralysis, and muscle wasting. Fingers become clawed, ulcers may develop, and fingers, toes, or whole feet can be lost. Many victims of this type live to be very old, with death the result of kidney disease or other problems of advanced age. This type of leprosy lasts on the average twenty years at least. 4 0 4. Th.

First Appearance The specific date at which leprosy arrived in the islands is not known, nor is it certain by whom it was brought. As early as 1823 missionaries were noting \"remediless and disgusting cases\" that might have involved some aspects of leprosy as well as syphilis. Dr. Arthur St. M. Mouritz, physician at the leprosy settlement at Kalawao for a period of four years, from 1884 to 1887, stated in 1916 that he felt there was sufficient proof that leprosy was present to a moderate extent in Hawaii at least as early as 183O.l The common Hawai'ian name for the disease was Ma'i-PZkG, or -- Chinese sickness. The association of the disease with the Chinese people probably had to do either with the fact that an individual or individuals of that race were noted to have the disease or simply that the Chinese were familiar with it because they had often seen it in their own country. There. is some belief that imported Chinese plantation laborers introduced it to the islands. Certainly, the possiblity exists that it came from any one of numerous seafaring individuals who visited Honolulu harbor after being recruited at the Azores, in Africa, Malaysia, and other seats of endemic leprosy. Some sources have suggested that it was introduced by a Hawai'ian chief who contracted it abroad and then spread it to others in the 184Os, giving rise to another name for it, Ma'i Ali'i, royal malady (the -- chief's sickness). 2 1.

Passage of \"Act to Prevent the Spread of Leprosy, I' 1865 King Kamehameha III organized the first Board of Health on December 13, 1850, at the advice of his Privy Council. The board was charged with protecting the people's health and with taking measures to cure them of epidemic diseases such as cholera. Although leprosy had been present in the kingdom from the early part of his reign, no discussion of it took place prior to the king's death in 1854. During Kamehameha I V's reign, leprosy was not officially mentioned until April 1863, when William Hillebrand, the medical director of Queen's Hospital in Honolulu, wrote that Although it may not appear quite in place, I will here avail myself of the opportunity to bring to your and the public's attention a subject of great importance. I mean the rapid spread of that new disease, called by the natives \"Mai Pake.\" It is the genuine Oriental leprosy, as has become evident to me from the numerous cases which have presented themselves at the Hospital. . . . It will be the duty of the next Legislature to devise and carry out some efficient, and at the same time, humane measure, by which the $solation of those affected with this disease can be accomplished. Upon Kamehameha V's ascendancy, at a meeting of the board on December 28, 1863, the subject of Mali-PZke was raised among -- other matters of importance to the general health--its first official discussion in that forum. At another meeting on February 10, 1864, it was noted that leprosy was spreading on the other islands and a census of victims around Honolulu was ordered so that the afflicted could be examined by the medical members of the board to study the disease's 3. Dr. W. Hillebrand, Surgeon to the Queen's Hospital, quoted in Ralph S. Kuykendall, The Hawaiian Kingdom, 1854-1874 (Honolulu: of Hawaii Press, x3), p. 73. University 12 ! origin and questions of its transmission and hereditability. 4 The subject was discussed several times after that, and on August IO, 1864, The subject of leprosy . . . was brought up before the Board, and its spread among the people reported. Dr. Hillebrand expressed his opinion that the disease is spreading. . . . The doctor was of opinion that isolation was the only course by which the spread of the disease could be arrested, and recommen %d some valley as the most likely place to meet the necessity. Feeling at this time that there was sufficient cause for alarm and that steps had to be taken to prevent the further spread of the disease, the Legislative Assembly of the Hawai'ian Islands passed \"An Act to Prevent the Spread of Leprosy\" in 1865, which King Kamehameha V approved. This law provided for setting apart land for an establishment for the isolation and seclusion of leprous persons who were thought capable of spreading the disease. Every physician or other person with knowledge of a case of leprosy had to report it to the proper sanitary authorities. The law also required all police and district justices, when requested, to arrest and deliver to the Board of Health any person alleged to have leprosy so that he could be medically inspected and thereafter removed to a place of treatment, or isolation if required. A hospital for the treatment of patients in the incipient stages of the disease would be established in an attempt to find a cure, but the Board of Health also had the power to send all patients considered incurable or capable of spreading the disease to a place of isolation. The Board of Health was requested to keep the amounts of sums expended for the leprosy p rog ram distinct from its general account of legislative appropriations and to report to the legislature at each of its regular 4.

Establishment of Kalihi Hospital, Honolulu, and the Isolation Settlement on Moloka'i On March 17, 1865, the Board of Health purchased for $1,000 some land in Palolo Valley, Oahu, on which it intended to establish temporary hospitals and dwellings for a leprosy colony that would ultimately house about 300 persons. Under this plan, a special section for severe cases would be set apart from the general settlement. Due to protests by adjoining residents that the water of the stream in that valley would become contaminated and thus unfit for their use, the land was never used. Further discussions on the matter of what to do with leprosy cases on June 10, 1865, resulted in two propositions. One was to establish a settlement for both light and severe cases near Honolulu, which would be simpler and less expensive and where the whole operation could be more concentrated. According to this plan, a site a few miles from town on the seashore, comprising about fifty acres, would accommodate a settlement in which the severe cases and the general settlement would be separated, each with its own hospital and dwellings. The other proposition suggested establishing hospitals and cottages for lighter cases in a place near the sea near Honolulu, about five to ten acres in extent, and selecting a large tract on another island on which to put the incurables. 7 The peninsula on the northern shore of Moloka'i seemed the most suitable spot for a leprosy settlement. Its southern side was bounded by a pair '--a vertical mountain wall of cliffs 1,800 to 2,000 feet high, and its north, west, and east sides by the sea and precipitous shores. Landings were possible in only two places, at Kalaupapa on the 6. See Appendix A for full text of \"An Act to Prevent the Spread of Leprosy,\" 1865. 7. Hawaiian Kingdom Board of Health, Leprosy in Hawaii, pp. 18-21. -- 14 west side and at Kalawao on the east side of the peninsula, weather permitting. Fruits, E, potatoes, and other vegetables could be easily grown on the flat land and in tributary canyons. Land was conducive to livestock raising and the sea was full of fish. Water was available in a stream running down Waikolu Valley to the east, a mile or more from Kalawao. Other springs were available, such as in Waihanau Valley, but at a considerable distance from the settlement. 8 The latter proposition was viewed favorably by the Board of Health. A lot at Kalihikai, about two miles from Honolulu, on the west side of the harbor and adjacent to the seashore was decided upon as a hospital for light cases and as a temporary detention station for severe cases of leprosy. A twelve-acre lot was purchased and hospital buildings erected. It was known as the Kalihi Hospital and Detention Station and opened for admission of patients on November 13, 1865. There all persons alleged to be afflicted with leprosy would be inspected and medically treated with a view toward effecting a cure. Proper attendance and nursing would be provided. Those individuals found to suffer from diseases other than leprosy would be given medicine and allowed to return home or continue to receive medical treatment. All patients in an advanced state of the disease, who were considered a possible health menace by spreading the contagion, would be required to move to the settlement at Kalaupapa on the island of Moloka'i where care would be given them.' 8.

Kalihi Hospital operated for about ten years; it was-fi-closed by the Board of Health in 1875 due to expensive upkeep, the difficulty of isolation, and its failure to find a cure for leprosy. All persons suspected of having leprosy were thereafter detained only until medical examiners could confirm the presence of the disease. If they could, the afflicted were sent immediately to Moloka'i. The detention station adjacent to the police station on King Street in Honolulu remained open until 1881. A new 15 3. The Effect of Enforced Isolation and Other Social Restrictions on the Hawai'ians Because leprosy was seen as highly contagious, and because of the inability to effect a cure, complete isolation of the afflicted was the policy determined upon by the Hawaiian Kingdom to prevent the spread of the disease. For the benefit of the healthy, persons suspected of leprosy were condemned to a life of virtual imprisonment on the windward side of the island of Moloka'i. The concept of segregation was completely alien to the fundamentals of Hawai'ian society and therefore greatly resented. The duty assumed by the Board of Health was delicate and difficult but deemed as essential for the public welfare. The forcible separation of individuals from family and friends seemed harsh not only to the victims and their relatives but to many not even affected by the policy who did not believe the disease was contagious and who therefore thought that such stringent measures as isolation were unnecessary. Walter M. Gibson, president of the Board of Health and managing editor of the Pacific Commercial Advertiser and the Hawaiian vernacular newspaper Nuhou, wrote in the latter in 1873: It [Mali-PBkG] is spreading rapidly. There are 438 confirmed IepeZnXlaupapa, and nearly as many more throughout the Islands with manifest symptoms of the disease. The chief cause of its increase lies in the native apathy. The healthy associate 9. (cont'd) hospital at Kaka'ako was dedicated on December 12, 1881, on the east side of Honolulu harbor, on the seashore, about one mile toward Diamond Head. This site became unsuitable when the high tides inundated the area. About 1889 the buildings were moved back to the old Kalihi Hospital site. The new complex was a detention station and hospital where mild leprosy cases were treated and advanced ones sent to Kalaupapa. Ultimately the Kalihi area was rezoned into an industrial district, and the introduction of noxious elements proved detrimental to the health and comfort of the patients. A more suitable physical plant was needed also, because most of the buildings were in a state of disrepair. In September 1946 an agreement was reached between the Territory and the U.S. Government by which the former could use eleven acres at Pearl City known as Naval Waimano Civilian Housing, together with all buildings, improvements, and equipment thereon. Tubercular patients from Leahi Hospital temporarily occupied the facility while additions were being made to that structure. After those patients were moved back to Leahi, all Kalihi patients were transferred to Pearl City on October 12, 1949. 16 0 ' carelessly with the . . . victims. The most awful conditions of the disease neither scare nor disgust. . . . The horror of this living death has no terror for Hawaiians, and therefore they have need more than any other people of a coercive segregation of those having contagious diseases. Some people consider this enforced isolation as a violence to personal rights16 It is so, no doubt, but a violence in behalf of human welfare. Adding to the complexity of the situation was the fact that this immense health problem took the kingdom by surprise. Already overwhelmed within the past few years by an influx of foreigners, new industries, and a variety of drastic changes to their religion and I ifeways , the Hawaiian population was declining rapidly. The drop in population was accompanied by \"a mass psychological deterioration\" 11 that was evidenced by a lack of social identity resulting in scepticism of the past and difficulty in adjusting to the present. By the latter part of the nineteenth century, what had once been a happy, carefree, and generous people were facing not only the problems of culture clash but were torn asunder by the effects of a disease \"that, more than any other, embodied 0 and symbolized the disastrous consequences-- biological and cultural--of contact between the Hawaiian Islands and the rest of the world. 'I 12 Measures taken by the board to combat the spread of leprosy were highly unpopular, for they were seen as penalties upon individuals afflicted by something beyond their control. Leprosy victims were ordered to turn themselves in for inspection. The energetic pursuit of sick individuals was a great blow to their friends and relatives. The 10. Walter M.

This influx caused severe housing problems at the settlement. On a visit by two board members in early 1873 it was decided that building accommodations were inadequate; it was also noted that many healthy native residents at Kalaupapa had kept possession of their kuleanas, containing many good houses, located on Board of Health land. Meyer, the board's agent, was instructed to carry out the purchase of those homesteads to obtain more housing and also to ensure complete isolation on the peninsula. This he accomplished to a great extent. Procurement of a good water supply for the hospitals, stores, and central buildings was a major requisite. A pipe six thousand feet long was laid (from Wai'ale'ia Valley?), with taps at convenient distances, enabling a good supply of fresh water for all. The superintendent at that time was W.P. Ragsdale. 25 G. Impressions of a Patient, Peter Kaeo, During this Period One of those who went voluntarily to Kalawao during this time was Peter Kaeo, cousin of Queen Emma, the consort of Kamehameha IV. Kaeo arrived on Moloka'i in late June 1873 and was released in 1876. The correspondence between Peter and Emma during his three-year stay on the peninsula provides valuable insight on Hawai'ian politics in general and on living conditions at the settlement specifically. A sketch map Kaeo sent Emma, showing the location of his house on the north side of the road to Kalaupapa, a little west of the hospital building, also shows part of the Kalawao settlement to be southeast of the store on the edge of 25.

Other houses were beginning to extend west toward the Kalaupapa landing. 26 Peter's house was on a rise at the foot of Kauhako Hill, halfway between Kalawao and Kalaupapa. It faced the sea on a flat between the pali and the crater. In front of his house was flat, rocky land, studded with old potato patches. One of his letters mentions a trip to look at the inside of the crater, where he noted breadfruit, 'ohi'a, lehua, kukui, and other trees growing. He stated that on the windward side of the crater where the trees were thickest, the Mormon elder and assistant supervisor of the settlement, J.H. Napela, held his Sunday meetings. 27 Kaeo also mentions the presence on the peninsula of many unafflicted persons who hid themselves by day and emerged at night to visit and help their relatives. Kokuas felt insecure in their position, and Kaeo mentions some of them hiding in caves for fear of being sent away by the Board of Health. He also stated that the board was rumored to have threatened to kill all the horses because they were eating all the grass and leaving none for the cattle. The people threatened trouble if that occurred, because those animals were their only means of hauling water. 28 Many serious problems still existed at Kalawao despite the Board of Health's claim in its 1874 report that notwithstanding the increased number of lepers, the difficulties of communication, etc. , there has not been one instance of want of food at the settlement. . . . The Board can assert that in a material point of view, these people are better off in Molokai 26. Sketch map of Peter Kaeo, 1873, in Queen Emma Collection, M-45, Hawaii State Archives, Honolulu. 27.

The rough coastline and often stormy and windy weather made it extremely difficult to land supplies. Kaeo mentioned one day when the sea was so rough that boats could not approach the shore, but could only throw the taro onto the rocks for people to grab as best they could. 30 He mentions in some detail problems with the food allowance: A House whare it holds two or more patients [is allowed] one [share of] Pai and 3 pounds of rice, half of Pai and half of Rice everywhare [elsewhere]. The natives begin to grumble on account of their having rice all the week round and very little Poi. . . . Our meat is so poor that we do not see any fat or signs of any hardly after it is dressed and delivered. . . . Some have no cooking utensils to cook with, so they ask for Salmon in place of Beef--but no Salmon. Some ask for rice in place of Pai, as the Pai is bad ar# sower, but Rice is scarce and only for those in the Hospital. Kaeo received much of his food supply from Queen Emma, but when he ran out, had to depend on his allowance as a leprosy victim. He supplemented this diet occasionally by hunting wild pigs on the plains, which were salted for winter use. He had servants with him, who helped in food preparation and gathering. Others were not so lucky. Peter described two men dying from hunger, one of whom had been living on rice and salmon for two weeks until his system could no longer digest it. Kaeo believed the fi, Ragsdale, was starving the inmates by forcing rice and salmon on them and restricting distribution of meat and poi in an 29. Report of the Board of Health for 1874, p. 72. 30.

Deaths that resulted at that time were probably from acute malnutrition, resulting from the physical deterioration marking advanced leprosy and faulty diet. E, the traditional staple diet item for Hawai'ians, was an emotional tie with childhood and old customs, and the lack of it produced psychosomatic consequences as well as nutritional deficiencies. 32 In early November 1873, Meyer informed the chairman of the Board of Health that its regulations on food rationing were no longer reflecting changing conditions of supply and demand. Although the number of patients was increasing, the amount of poi provided by the board was the same. Also the failure of ships to land supplies to replenish food reserves meant people often suffered. Not until February 1874, however, were weekly rations increased by the board. 33 Peter also mentions the kama%iinas-- early landowners still living on the peninsula --and their desire to remain there until their death. Those people were always a source of frustration to the government both because they took up much needed living space and because they thwarted the policy of complete segregation. According to one of Peter's letters, the Board of Health was not against kama'sinas helping the patients or associating with them as long as they did not intend ever to leave the peninsula. 34 H. Arrival of Father Joseph Damien de Veuster 1. Decision to Become a Priest Joseph de Veuster was born January 3, 1840, in Tremeloo, Belgium, into a fairly well-to-do peasant family that raised and sold 32.

Letter 15, Peter to Emma, Kalaupapa, July 27, 1873, in ibid., p. 36. 77 grain. His parents, Francis and Anne Catherine, had eight children, half of whom entered the religious life. Attending school until the age of thirteen , he then returned to the family farm to work in the fields. In 1853 his brother Auguste entered the seminary and four years later went to the Sacred Hearts Fathers novitiate at Louvain. Joseph continued working the farm for a while, a smart, helpful young man with a deep sense of piety and a quiet inner strength. He returned to boarding school in 1858 in preparation for a future as a grain trader. He wholeheartedly tackled his studies of French and the religious education offered. It was evidently during this time that he heard the call of God. He at first kept this revelation to himself, for with so many other siblings in religious orders, Joseph was the one expected to carry on the family grain business. As the months went by, however, Damien's resolution deepened. Seven months after entering school at Braine-le-Comte, Damien warned his parents of his mission in life: Don't think this idea of entering the religious life is my idea! It's Providence, I tell you, that is inspiring me. Don't put any obstacles in the way. God is calling me. I must obey. If I refuse I run the risk of going to hell. As for you, god will punish you terribly for standing in the way of His will. What could his parents do in response to such an ultimatum? Although undoubtedly disappointed that he would not be continuing the family trade, they also realized they could not deny him this calling. Having made his decision, Joseph wasted no time in beginning his holy service. Leaving Braine-le-Comte, he joined his brother Auguste (now Brother Pamphile) at Louvain, where he was accepted as a postulant. 2. The Fathers of the Sacred Hearts The religious order that Joseph de Veuster entered in January 1859 bears the canonical name Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary and of Perpetual Adoration of the Most Blessed 35. Vital Jourdan, The Heart of Father Damien, 1840-1889, rev. Guild PrG, ?%@, pp. 14-15. 78 Sacrament of the Altar. It is referred to more commonly as the Sacred Hearts Fathers, the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts, or the Picpus Fathers, referring to the Paris street on which the mother house was located. The founder of this congregation, Father Marie-Joseph Coudrin, had a vision in 1792 of missionaries going all over the world spreading love for the Sacred Hearts. The Sacred Hearts Congregation was founded in 1800 to \"practice and propagate devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary,\" and to carry on continual adoration, involving a half hour of day adoration daily and one hour of night adoration weekly . This routine was faithfully carried on by Damien at Moloka'i . 36 Approved by Pope Pius VII in 1817, the congregation was asked eight years later to undertake the conversion of the Polynesians in the South Seas. Missionaries left for Hawai'i in 1827. 3. Joseph de Veuster Studies for the Priesthood Upon entering the house of the Picpus Fathers, nineteen-year-old Joseph was described as being a young man exceptionally good to look upon. Along with the strength and healthy physique so necessary for a missionary's work, he had dark curly hair and a frank, handsome face, a face destined to be cruelly ravaged by the worst disease known :doy97 but at that time glowing with hope and youthful . The biggest obstacle for Joseph to overcome in his monastic training was his ignorance of classical languages. According to the rules of the order, because of this lack he had to be placed among the lay brothers and could not hope to become an ordained priest. At first this did not bother Joseph, whose zeal for service of any kind was all-devouring. It was not long before his superiors, perceiving his determination to overcome all obstacles and the tenacity with which he pursued all his tasks and especially the study of Latin, took special pains 36. Ibid., p. 17. 37. Farrow, Damien the Leper, 1951, p. 16. 79 - to remedy his academic deficiencies to allow him to enter the ranks of those studying for the priesthood. Leaving Louvain at the end of June 1860, Joseph entered the French novitiate at lssy near Paris. At the mother house, on October 7, 1860, he took his final vow of poverty, chastity, and obedience. Laying aside his baptismal name, he adopted a new one, as was the order's custom. It seems especially fitting that he chose as his patron Damien --the physician of Cilicia who spent his life serving others and finally accepted a martyr's death in the early fourth century . Throughout his ecclesiastical training, Damien underwent long periods of self discipline. Many of the character traits he had to contend with at this time continued to surface at Moloka'i, such as sudden bursts of temper that immediately consumed him with remorse, and a compulsion to get things done that made his life a constant shift from prayer to work and back again. Vital Jourdan points out that Damien differed a great deal from many of his fellow students: If a novice's perfection consisted solely in keeping himself in a state of passivity and receptivity in blind obedience to his director without any personal initiative on his part, Brother Damien was assuredly not good novice material. For to these things he added his own outlook, his own turn of mind, his own style of thin king and acting . No up-in-the-clouds spirituality for him. He was original enough to settle difficulties by means of his own rich imagination. Coming late to the religious life, with bits of the material world clinging to him and a newly acquired spirituality, he set about ridding himself of an awkwardness, a clumsy way of expressing his best feelings that sometimes brought him grief. However, it was that originality, the initiative cultivated on the edges of the beaten sh, that was going to make his life such a tremendous success. 4. Damien Leaves for Hawai'i In 1863 the Sacred Hearts Fathers decided to send missionary reinforcements to the Hawai'ian Islands to help Bishop Louis 38. Jourdan, Heart of Father Damien, 1960, pp. 20-21. -- 80 Maigret, the Vicar Apostolic. Father Pamphile was chosen as one of the party of six priests and brothers and ten sisters. As it turned out, however, Divine Providence had other plans in store for the de Veuster brothers. During a typhoid epidemic in Louvain, while visiting the sick, Pamphile caught the disease. Damien nursed him back to health and started him on a long convalescent period. Despite his extreme disappointment at not being able to go on the journey, Pamphile encouraged his brother to get permission to go in his place. Bypassing his own immediate superiors, Damien sent his request directly to the Superior General in Paris. After many long and anxious days of waiting, Damien was informed that he could go. His happiness was unbounded. With time only for a quick but emotional farewell to his family, whom he would never see again, and a short retreat in Paris, Damien began the long, slow voyage to his martyrdom. On May 21, 1864, Father Damien was ordained to the priesthood in the Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace in downtown Honolulu. From there he was sent to the Puna district on the island of Hawai'i where he ministered to the spiritual needs of the 350 Catholics in the area. He was later transferred to the Kohala and Hamakua districts, serving eight years in that mission. During that time many of his parishioners were sent into isolation on Moloka'i. 5. Father Damien Volunteers as Resident Priest at Kalawao On May 4, 1873, Monsignor Maigret consecrated a new church at Wailuku on the island of Maui. A few Picpus Fathers from neighboring districts were invited to assist in the ceremony, Damien among them. During their time together, these missionaries discussed many things, touching frequently upon the leprosy victims isolated at Kalawao and especially the sad spiritual condition of the Catholics among them. 81 It had been almost impossible to minister to the spiritual needs of the Catholic leprosy victims up to that time. Once a year, perhaps, a priest would spend two or three days at the settlement. Father Raymond Delalande, who visited there for several weeks in 1871, found such an enthusiastic welcome that the bishop decided to build a chapel. The church was erected by a lay worker in six weeks and was ready for use by the end of May 1872. There the Catholics gathered each Sunday to pray, sing, and recite the rosary. Bishop Maigret informed the priests that the people of the settlement had recently sent him a petition requesting a resident priest. Although Maigret had decided to grant the request, it would be a difficult decision. to impose such a sentence on the person administering that post. At that point, several young priests, including Damien, eagerly volunteered for the assignment, and it was decided to have four priests serve on a rotating basis. Damien's pioneering work at Puna and Kohala, his wish to join the -multitude of his parishioners that had been sent to Kalawao, and his obvious earnest and sincere desire to help the afflicted may have made him the obvious first choice for the post. His offer was accepted with both sadness and joy by his bishop. A few months later, in explaining his reasons for that great decision, Damien stated that When the agents of the Board [of Health] came to carry off some of my faithful, a voice within me told me that I should rejoin them some day. When I took ship to Wailuku, the same voice warned me that I should never return to Kohala, that I should never again see my well-beloved children nor the beautiful chapels I had built. For this reason, there were tears in my eyes when I turned away from that Catholic settlement to which I &d become attached during the eight years I had spent in it, 0 I I 0 39. Englebert, Hero of Molokai, p. 137. -- 82 6. Arrival of Father Damien at Kalawao On May 10, 1873, Damien accompanied Bishop Maigret from Maui on board the steamer Kilauea, carrying a load of fifty leprosy victims and a cargo of cattle bound for Kalawao settlement. As the boat neared Moloka'i and the residents caught sight of the holy pair, the bishop recounted later that those who were able to walk ran down from Kalawao. Our neophytes surrounded us, their rosaries hanging from their necks. . . . How great was their joy, when I presented to them the man who had asked to come to them and was henceforth to be their father! ThexOcast themselves on their knees with tears brimming their eyes. Although there was an initial understanding on the bishop's part that Damien would be relieved in his work on Moloka'i within a few weeks, it is fairly certain that Damien, who was possessed of \"an appetite for doing good for God in difficult circumstances,\" 41 from the first was determined to devote the rest of his life to the leprosy victims of Moloka'i. Having left home with no firm indication that he would not be returning, Damien arrived at Kalawao without a change of clothing or any personal effects. Lacking even a home, he found shelter for the first few nights in the open under a @ hala tree. Damien's arrival as a resident priest prompted a flood of charitable publicity toward the Catholic church. Damien's self sacrifice and his willingness to risk constant exposure to a terrible disease were widely acclaimed in the Honlulu press: And yet, as the provincial remarked, there was nothing unusual in this among the Sacred Hearts Fathers: it happened whenever one of them went to a district where the mission was not established. And, of course, there had been Sacred Hearts Fathers and brothers at Kalawao before Damien. But \"all that had happened without noise, without public admiration. The 40. pp. 137-38. 41. Gavan Daws, Holy Man: Father Damien of Molokai (New York: Harper & Row, Publishers, 1973), p. 57. - 83 honor of attracting attention, exciting sywathy, stirring up the press, was reserved to Father Damien .'I Because of the overwhelming public response to Damien's presence at Kalawao and his insistence on wanting to stay, his superiors decided to leave him there permanently. He could come to Honolulu overnight for confession when he wished. 7. Father Damien's Comments on Conditions at Kalawao In March 1886, Damien produced a manuscript at the request of Walter Gibson, then president of the Board of Health, recounting the state of affairs at the leprosy settlement upon his arrival there at the age of thirty-three. These memoirs are fascinating reading and provide probably better than any other source an accurate description of social and economic conditions during the pioneer Kalawao settlement period. Following are the general topics he discussed: a> \"The Diet of the Lepers\" Damien believed that diet greatly influenced the affects of leprosy. For a long time the food of the settlement was of poor quality, insufficient, and unequally distributed. The starchy vegetable taro seemed the easiest food to digest and never caused ill effects. It seemed to be necessary emotionally as well as dietetically, for he noted that at one time, \"the place having been about three months without taro on account of the scarcity of that vegetable, several cases of death occurred in consequence of it, and the majority of the people looked very emaciated, although they had plenty of rice, and sweet potatoes. 1143 The settlement's regular supply of taro was cultivated in HBlawa, Wailau, and 42. Ibid., p. 62. 43. J. Damien, \"Special Report from Rev. Father J . Damien, Catholic Priest at Kalawao. Personal Experience During Thirteen Years of Labor Among the Lepers at Kalawao,\" March 1, 1886, MS., Hawaii State Archives, Honolulu, p. 5. 84 Pelekunu valleys and the cooked or &i 'ai brought by sea in open - boats or a small schooner or steamer. The latter method of transportation was most successful because schooners and boats were often prevented from arriving by rough weather, thus depriving the people of their major food item. The rice or hard bread issued when poi was not available sufficed for an emergency but could not support the Hawai'ians as a principal food. Sweet potatoes raised by patients were used to add variety to the diet, but also were used in making an intoxicating drink of which the Hawai'ians were very fond but which had a detrimental affect on their health. A pint of milk was also provided for nourishment. The milk came from milch cows, which unfortunately often had to be killed for meat when the regular supply of beef cattle failed to appear on time. b) \"The Water Supply of the Settlement\" Procurement of water was one of the major problems patients had to contend with. The only dependable stream was in Wai'ale'ia Valley, and water had to be brought from the gulch to homes in paint cans carried on shoulders or on horses. Clothes were also washed in this stream, although very infrequently because of the distance involved. When the Board of Health supplied water pipes in the summer of 1873, a reservoir was built and a water line laid to the settlement. After that, abundant water was available for drinking, bathing, and washing, and people were better off there than at Kalaupapa where only rainwater or brackish well water were available. Damien mentioned that he had been informed that at the terminus of Waihanau Valley, just southeast of Kalaupapa settlement, was a natural reservoir. He immediately went out to inspect the site and did find a natural semicircular basin seventy-two feet in diameter one way and fifty-five feet another way. Soundings determined it to be at least eighteen feet deep in the center. The water was clear, icy cold, and of good flavor. Old residents of the area told Damien that the pool never dried up, remaining a permanent source of water throughout the year. 85 illustration 11. Father Damien and \"the choir, \" no date. Courtesy Bishop Museum, Honolulu. The question of how better to supply water for Kalaupapa had been under discussion for a long time, but nothing had been done because of the impression that it would be too costly. Now Damien felt that instead of considering going to Waikolu for a water supply, pipes should be laid from the Waihanau reservoir to the village. c> \"The Dwellings of the Lepers\" Upon Damien's arrival, he found 816 residents, som-e of whom he had known from his earlier missionary work on Hawai'i. The Kalaupapa landing place was \"a Some what Deserted village of three or four wooden cottages and a few old grass houses. The lepers were allowed to go there only on the Days when a vessel arrived. . . . \"44 The patients all lived at Kalawao, about eighty of them in the hospital. The rest, with a few kijkuas, lived farther up toward \"the valley,\" probably Wai'ale'ia, where the most advanced sufferers lived apart. Houses were built out of wood taken from old @ hala groves. Some residents did not even have that much covering and were living in shelters formed from the branches of castor oil trees covered with ki or - sugar cane leaves and sometimes with piJ grass. There were living \"pell mell, without distinction of ages or sexes, old or new cases, all more or less strangers one to another, those unfortunate outcasts of society. ,145 Because ventilation was usually lacking in those small huts, the dampness had an extremely detrimental effect on the residents, causing scabs, sores, and very weakened constitutions. As 1874 approached, a question arose as to how, in the face of limited government appropriations, the habitations of the people could be improved. Time was passed in playing cards, in native dances, and in drinking fermented s-root beer. Because water was scarce, clothes were seldom cleaned: 44. Ibid., p. 1. 45. Ibid., p. 2. 88 The smell of their filth mixed with exhalation of their sores was simply disgusting and unbearable to a new comer. Many a time in fulfilling my priestly duty at their domiciles, I have been obliged , not only to close my nostrils, but to run out side, to breathe fresh air. To protect my legs from a peculiar itching, which I usually experienced every evening after my visiting ;ro;; 46 I had to beg a friend of mine to send me a pair of heavy . Whereas Peter Kaeo used to ask his cousin to send him a bottle of camphor periodically, which he would put on his kerchief to smell when passing the hospital on his way to bathe in Waikolu Valley, Damien took up pipe smoking as a way of counteracting the overpowering odors. At the time of Damien's arrival, the disease was taking fearful tolls on the inhabitants. That fact and the degrading living conditions gave the place the reputation of a living graveyard. d) \"The Clothing of the Lepers\" The climate of the Kalaupapa peninsula often worked great hardship on the leprosy victims. Because of the settlement's location on the north side of the island, backed by very high mountains, the temperature was often cool. Frequent storms, bringing rain and wind, were almost unbearable for people whose circulation at advanced stages of the disease was poor at best. Peter Kaeo tells about coming across villagers living in caves who, when asked why they did not go to the hospital, replied that their cave was preferable because the hospital was \"anu anu\". -- Other villagers he found living by the side of a stone wall they had built and covered with mats were also anu anu. 47 Kaeo noted in the fail of -- 1873 that about half of the people were in dreadful fear of the rainy season because of their desperate lack of clothing. Their woolen blankets 46. Ibid., p. 3. 47. Letter 35, Peter to Emma, Kalaupapa, August 31, 1873, in Korn, News from Molokai, p. 80. -- 89 were completely threadbare, they had no undergarments, and children were dressed in rags. 48 0 Damien found that the cold, damp weather had a deleterious effect on those without warm clothes, causing fevers, coughs, swelling in the face and limbs, and congestion in the lungs. Although each victim received a suit of clothes and a blanket from the government every year, because of neglect and lack of washing, they wore out within only a few months. Friends and relatives often supplied clothes, but those without this means of help suffered greatly before the settlement store was established. Those who could earn a little money to buy necessities had to entrust it to the schooner captain to buy such items for them. It was with a great deal of relief within the settlement that news arrived about the inauguration of the Moloka'i store in the summer of 1873. With the issuance of six dollars to each person every year to buy what they wanted, the clothing situation was greatly improved. Occasional charity offerings also helped ameliorate that particular problem. 4 \"Exercise for the Lepers\" Father Damien felt it was very important that exercise be a part of the leprosy victim's daily schedule. Any physical activity would help circulation of the blood and offset to some degree paralysis of nerves and muscles. On Damien's arrival he found most people concerned only with sleeping, drinking, and playing cards; only a small minority partook of any exercise, mostly in the form of cultivating fields and riding the few horses available. f> \"The Morality of the Leper Settlement\" Previous to Damien's arrival it had been widely acknowledged that one of the greatest needs of the people at Kalawao was for a spiritual leader or priest. Because of this lack, vice and 48. Letter 47, Peter to Emma, Kalaupapa, October 1, 1873, in ibid., p. 123. 90 degradation were rampant. Damien briefly outlined the state of affairs with which he first had to contend: In consequence of this impious theory, the people, mostly all unmarried, or separated on account of the disease, were living promiscuously without distinction of sex and many an unfortunate woman, had to become a prostitute to obtain friends who would take care of her, and her children, when well and strong, were used as servants; Once that the disease prostrated them, such women and children were often cast out, and had to find an other shelter; sometimes they were laid behind a stone wall and left there to die and at other times a hired hand would carry them to the hospital. The so much praised aloha of the natives was entirely lacking here, at least in this respect. As already mentioned in other pages, the Hawaiian hula was organized after the pagan fashion, under the protection of the old deity Laka, who had his numerous altars, and sacrifices, and I candidly confess, that I had hard work to annihilate Laka's religions and worship4$nd thereby put a stop to the hula, and its bad consequences. Another source of immorality was intoxication. The natives cooked, fermented, and distilled the root of the g plant, which grew abundantly along the foot of the mountains. The beverage was so imperfectly distilled that it was actually totally unfit for consumption and seemed to make people temporarily mad. This practice was illegal but difficult to stop because certain members of the police force were themselves involved in the distilling operations. Damien seemed, however, to have enough moral authority and physical strength to stop much of the illegal and immoral activity of the non-Catholics as well as of his flock. 9) \"Medical Treatment\" During the first period of the settlement's existence, from 1866 to 1873, the superintendents had made some attempt to furnish medicine to the sick as required. Many of the patients also relied on 49. Damien, \"Personal Experience,\" 1886, p. 30. 91 their own native remedies. Despite this, Damien noted that he found these people less addicted to sorcery and the practices of native doctors l than were the natives he had ministered to on Hawai'i. Because of the shortages of medicine and trained medical personnel, ulcers were often left unattended and exposed to dirt, flies, and vermin, and commonplace problems such as fever or diarrhea could cause death due to lack of treatment. 92 0 VII, Kalawao Settlement Period, 1874-1900 A. Social and Physical Conditions Improve 1. New Hooe Arises a> Legislature Takes More Interest in Settlement The second and by far the most extensive development period for Kalawao began in 1874. Certain reforms in the administration of the settlement had already begun under King Lunalilo, who died on February 3, 1874, after reigning just over a year. At his death, the succession came into dispute, between David KalZikaua, who had been defeated by Lunalilo the previous year, and Queen Emma, the widow of Kamehameha IV. On February 12, Kalakaua was elected by the Hawai'ian Legislature and reigned from 1874 to 1891 as Hawai'i's last king. The interest in conditions at the leprosy settlement that had been shown in the 1873 biennial legislature continued at each successive session, and committees were regularly appointed to visit Moloka'i and report on housing conditions, food supply, morale , and other concerns. b) Reaction to Father Damien's Placement at Kalawao As stated earlier, it was obvious that Damien had determined from the very moment of accepting the first stint of what was supposed to be a rotating position as resident priest to stay in the settlement. He started in on his new duties with an enthusiasm and energy that would require the most of his physical stamina: There's something to keep me busy from morning to night. On my list I have two hundred and ten Catholics and eighty catechumens. Yesterday, high Mass, Communions, superb singing, many and since I arrived crowds of confessions. Damien's landing at Kalawao created a major stir in Hawai'i. He was acclaimed as a Christian hero, whose response to the plight of these unfortunates had been immediate and unhesitating and who had gone to the island completely without resources. (All Hawai'ian missionaries traveled without provisions and the fact that he had no 0 1. Jourdan, -- Heart of Father Damien, 1960, p. 115. 93 baggage was because the steamer happened to be at Maui taking on a shipment of cattle for the settlement and Damien took advantage of its presence to leave immediately. > Although Damien never cultivated the publicity his presence on Kalawao generated, it bothered many people who felt that it ignored the efforts made by non-Catholics and even other earlier Catholic workers. Even many of Damien's Catholic superiors were amazed at the response and wondered why earlier priests had not been so eulogized. Unmindful of the furor and blissfully happy at the task he had set for himself, Damien returned to Honolulu during the early summer and confirmed his orders to stay at Kalawao. Damien's years at the settlement were filled with controversy. The Board of Health, whose members included several Protestant ministers, from the beginning was apprehensive at his presence and of what he might undertake and also somewhat embarrassed by and resentful of the immediate glory he was awarded. He was criticized for going there without official authorization, and, although the board could not expel him because of the pressure of public opinion, it did in September 1873 demand that he abide by the segregation and isolation regulations and not leave the settlement, for fear of spreading the disease. Damien was greatly sorrowed by this order, for it meant not seeing fellow missionaries or his superiors and, most difficult of all to accept, not going to confession. Not only was he not to leave the island, but he was also not to go over the pali to care for Catholics on the south shore of Moloka'i. Two months later the decree was modified to permit religious personnel to exercise the functions of their office, and Damien proceeded to interpret this as freely as possible so that he could reach everyone who he felt needed him. Without fear and not in defiance, but in the pursuit of his divine calling, he frequently journeyed beyond the confines of the settlement. Damien's official position at the settlement was as a delegate of the bishop, assigned to minister to the Catholic population, both at the settlement and elsewhere on the island. He was a non-patient in the eyes of the civil authority--the Board of Health--and needed its permission to stay in the area. He had to respect the governmental 94 administration. He freely intervened in matters, however> when he felt circumstances warranted it. c> Father Damien's Position in Settlement Affairs The Board of Health's misgivings about Damien are easy to understand. Although the board was dedicated to improving the physical and mental welfare of the patients, it viewed with some alarm the arrival of a strong-minded priest whose personality and intent were totally unknown to its members. Damien's personality enabled him to achieve much at the settlement from the beginning. Without the training of even the average priest of his time, he was admirably suited to such a pioneering challenge as this. He was not unfamiliar with leprosy, having cared for and ministered to its victims in his previous parishes, though never to the numbers he was surrounded with here. He had watched the whole process of segregation with interest and compassion and seems to have early formed a bond with those suffering from the disease. Still, at first he felt some revulsion toward the disease's manifestations. It took great will power for him to overcome his fears and touch members of his flock without hesitation. His temperament was energetic to the point of exhaustion and impatient at roadblocks to his plans for improvement of the social and spiritual condition of his people. His unyielding attitude on a variety of affairs, not all concerned with his religious duties, often brought him in conflict with the board, which considered him stubborn and hardheaded. The situation in which he found himself was difficult, however, and he felt there were problems that demanded immediate attention. He was almost always pleasant and spontaneously enthusiastic in everyday activities, while sensitive and often moved to tearful compassion over the condition of his fellow exiles. In addition to his assets of fearlessness, drive, optimism, and a true spirit of divine love that drew him and the sufferers together, he retained some aspects of character that would continue to draw criticism, often rightfully so, from his detractors. It is true, also, that he was unrefined, often unmindful of personal cleanliness, and certainly constantly careless in exposing 95 himself to the wounds and exhalations of his patients, which were then thought to transmit the disease. He was, however, a man of the people, someone with whom his flock immediately felt affinity. He was a skilled laborer and carpenter, and his youth spent on the family farm had conditioned him to ably perform all types of manual labor. Damien's impact on the development of the Moloka'i leprosy settlement was extensive. He was the only priest at the village most of the time, with periodic help extended by other members of his order, until his death on April 15, 1889. The publicity accorded him from the time of his arrival at the settlement throughout his work there drew public attention to the plight of the unfortunate residents and stimulated continuing efforts to improve their plight. Research on leprosy was making some progress at that time: the leprosy bacillus had been discovered only a few months prior to Damien's arrival at Kalawao. Damien's observations on the disease and its physical and mental effects on individuals added much data to that phase of medical history. More important was the effect of Damien's arrival on the people themselves, for almost from the first day, the atmosphere of the settlement changed. His good nature, healthy countenance, and immediate efforts to be friendly sparked a wave of new hope. His ultimate diagnosis as a victim of leprosy forever bonded him to them as a brother. Damien was priest, doctor, nurse, carpenter, farmer, coffin-maker, gravedigger, mediator, and father figure, and in all these roles had a significant impact on every aspect of the leprosy treatment program in the islands. 2. Father Damien Attacks Problems of Settlement a> Initial Fight Against Poverty and Vice It was obvious from the first that Damien's work at Kalawao would involve more than ministering to spiritual needs, for religious and emotional states were closely tied to physical condition. His daily contact with the sick gave him an understanding of their needs that no one else could hope to obtain. Beginning immediately to procure the necessary smaller items such as clothes and special foods, he appealed to 96 public charity and especially the Sacred Hearts sisters in Honolulu. Damien kept a store at his house where provisions were supplied free to those who needed them. Its stock came from mission gifts and other charitable donations and was much utilized by the very poor. These actions brought him to the attention of Honolulu society and enriched his reputation as a benefactor of the unfortunate. It would become obvious to the Board of Health, too, that Damien was a trustworthy liaison between the people and the government and would be a strong advocate for welfare of the settlement. Damien's strong-willed Flemish temperament stood him in good stead when it came to waging war against the lawless elements among the residents. His first order of business was to bring discipline and order to the settlement. Although some of the people ,accepted him quickly, others were inclined to be resentful of his presence and sullen in the face of his authority. Many violent clashes occurred when he began his crusade against immorality in the village, but Damien's physical strength, determination to succeed, and courage ultimately tilted the battle in his favor. b) Tenure as Resident Superintendent The Board of Health soon came to view Father Damien as a stable and guiding influence in the colony and endeavored to work closely with him. When the post of resident superintendent became vacant in November 1877, the government offered it to Damien at a salary of $10,000 a year. Indignantly he refused the salary, saying \"If you presented me with a hundred thousand, I would not want it,\" reminding them that \"If I had profit only in view, I would not stay here five minutes. Only God and His service of souls keep me here. 'I2 He did, however, consent to act as temporary superintendent, which he did for three months until February 25, 1878. The end of this period came as a great relief to him, for his administrative duties had taken up most of his 2. Ibid., p. 138. 97 time and interfered with his spiritual mission. The post had also temporarily put him in a slightly different relationship with his people, and he liked dealing with them on a spiritual level better. By 1879 the board was sending Damien provisions just as it did for the patients. It recognized him as a powerful moral force and as an indispensable aid in the administration of the settlement due to his immediate knowledge of the state of affairs and the needs of the patients. The board always attempted to meet his strong demands for better food, clothing, and organization within the limits of its power and money. c> Daily Routine Father Damien had not much time to sit and brood over the fate that had brought him to Moloka'i even if he had been so inclined. In 1873 when he came to the settlement, seven years after its beginning, its population had doubled to 800 people. It remained within that range with only slight variation until 1888 when it began increasing dramatically to a peak of 1,180 residents around 1890: Year 1873 415 142 515 285 1874 78 141 455 266 1875 178 149 465 279 1876 75 119 432 262 1877 122 129 433 251 1878 209 111 477 305 1879 92 204 414 254 1880 51 151 352 216 1881 195 129 398 236 1882 70 111 369 224 1883 300 150 453 290 1884 108 167 430 252 1885 103 142 422 221 1886 43 101 389 191 1887 220 111 449 239 1888 571 236 643 368 1889 307 444 Admissions Deaths at to Lazaretto Lazaretto Number of Lepers at the end of the year Men Women - - Total [patients] 800 721 744 294 [694] 684 782 668 682 During the years 1888 to 1902, segregation was at its maximum enforcement. 3. Englebert, Hero of Molokai, pp. 153-54. -- 98 l Father Damien never failed to meet newcomers to the island at the landing place in order to give them a warm welcome and an orientation to their new home. Much of the reason for his final acceptance among the people was that he soon showed no fear or revulsion toward them, an attitude he had to work on, but that was necessary to win the full confidence and trust of the residents. In writing to his brother in November 1873 regarding his arrival on Moloka'i, Damien recalled: I have had great difficulty in getting accustomed to such an atmosphere. One day, at the Sunday Mass, I found myself so stifled that I thought I must leave the altar to breathe a little of the outer air, but I restrained myself. . . . Now my sense of smell does not cause me so much inconvenience, and I enter the huts of the lepers without difficulty. Sometimes, indeed, I still feel some repugnance when I have to hear the confessions of those near their end, whose wounds are full of maggots. Often, also, I scarce know how to administer Extreme ynction, when both hands and feet are nothing but raw wounds. Damien every morning visited the sick, Catholic and non-Catholic, often partook freely of meals with them, worked by their side daily, and without hesitation dressed and cleaned their wounds. He identified himself with them as much as possible: \"As for me, I make myself a leper with the lepers, to gain all to Jesus Christ. That is why in preaching, I say, We lepers, not, Q brethren, as in Europe. ,I5 Once - he had allayed his flock's distrust and started them again on the path of righteousness, other pressing matters could be dealt with. d) Improved Housing One of the worst problems perceived by Father Damien was the deplorable housing situation at Kalawao. The tiny 4. Jourdan, Heart of -- Father Damien, 1960, p. 142. 5. Father Pamphile, ed., of the Lepers (London: Life and Letters of Father Damien, the Apostle - - The Catholic Truth Society, 1889), pp. 93-94. Note that Damien's strong identification with the people and his manner of . . addressing them in sermons began long before he contracted the disease. 99 makeshift grass huts, constantly pervaded by rain and wind, crowded and unsanitary, and furnished only with skimpy sleeping mats, were major factors contributing to the high mortality rate. Damien immediately began campaigning for new housing, and was aided in his endeavor by the forces of nature. In late November 1874 a fierce wind began to blow and rain poured down. When the storm abated, Peter Kaeo rode into Kalawao to assess the destruction. Twenty-two houses had been flattened and fifty more damaged. In addition, papaya trees, acres of koli'i, and groves of newly planted banana trees were uprooted. His assessment of the damage was at least $3,000 .6 Disheartening as the destruction was, it did result in acquiring new building materials such as scantling (square laths), rough N . W. (Northwest?) boards, and the old material of the former Kalihi Hospital from the Board of Health and from private individuals. A period of housing construction began in 1874, and by 1886 no fewer than three hundred simple wooden dwellings, set on trestles to raise them off the wet ground, had been erected by Damien, private carpenters, and such patients as were able. They were painted or whitewashed with lime on the exterior. As the parish grew, Damien established a system whereby church members built their own homes, under his direction, using church funds. As a rule, upon their death, Catholics bequeathed their homes to the church. Many of these Catholic homes were much better than those provided by the government. Because they were larger and more substantial they were in great demand and undoubtedly prompted several conversions. Responsibility for behaving as good Christians was demanded of the homeowners, however, and laxness in living up to what Damien considered one's religious responsibilities could result in eviction. 7 6. Letter 104, Peter to Emma, Kalaupapa, November 22, 1874, in Korn, News from Molokai, pp. 262-63. -- 7. Charles J. Dutton, The Samaritans of Molokai (Freeport, N .Y. : Books for Libraries Press, %@), p. 79. - e. The Church and Churchyard (1) Presbytery As regards his own quarters, Damien at first refused to sleep in the houses of the leprosy victims and spent his first nights under a @ hala tree next to St. Philomena Church. This he probably did to forestall immediate intimate contact with the people, but the time alone also may have been essential to periodically rededicate himself to the awesome task before him. Romantic as this situation might appear, and despite its enhancement of the legend of Father Damien, it could not have been a very comfortable situation. Damien might not even have noticed, however, because he probably returned to his bed at night in a state of exhaustion. Damien first built himself a small wooden hut, sixteen by ten feet, where he lived for five years. Finally, in 1878, due to charity subscriptions made by the whites in Honolulu, he was able to build a more suitable dwelling. It was a small presbytery, about twenty-four by twenty-one feet, two stories high, with an exterior stairway leading to the upper verandah. 8 Located beside the cemetery, it was convenient for officiating daily at graveside and for carrying out his grave digging tasks. Father Damien wrote his brother that \"The cemetery, church and my house form one enclosure; thus at night time I am the sole keeper of this garden of the dead. . . .'I 9 Apparently this house originally was west of St. Philomena, for Brother Joseph Dutton stated in his memoirs, published in 1931, that To the right [east] of it [St. Philomena] stands Father Damien's house. This was at one time a two-story structure, but the lower story was cut out, the top part dropped down upon sills, and moved to where it now stands, being used as a singing house, and for other purposes. It used to stand on the other ---- --- 8. Father Pamphile, Life and Letters of Father Damien, p. 115. -- 9. Farrow, 0 Damien the Leper, 1951, p. 139. 101 Illustration 12.

The second floor held a workroom/office and bedroom; the first level was used as a dispensary and consulting room. (2) Religious Zeal Awakened Because of the renewed interest in Catholic church matters spurred by Father Damien's arrival, attendance at Mass and other religious occasions increased tremendously. Tiny St. Philomena became the soul of the colony for Catholics and many others, the source of new-found hope. Daily church visitation increased and conversions and baptisms were numerous. Morning Mass and recitation of the rosary in the evenings drew daily crowds. Damien knew the Hawai'ian love of ceremony and made Sunday High Mass the highlight of the week. The nuns in Honolulu had sent red soutanes and lace surplices for the altar and choir boys and their colorful appearance, in addition to the spectacle of candles and flowers decorating the altar, plus the pomp of sacred music and prayers, attracted a large crowd. Charles Warren Stoddard, paying a visit to the settlement in 1884, described Mass at St. Philomena: Father [Damien] had placed me to the left of the altar in the place usually reserved for him, surrounded by a little railing. I missed nothing of the spectacle. The sacred vessels are of gold, admirably embellished. They are the gift of the pastor of St. Roth in Paris, and they are used only at High Mass. All the choir boys were disfigured by leprosy. It was painful to look at some of them. Most of them no longer had fingers on their hands or toes on their feet. 10. Howard D. Case, ed., The- Strayw;+ Joseph Dutton [His Memoirs]: Forty-four Years (Honolulu: $ Service of Molokal, Press of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin, Lt'Fj-, 1931), p. 110. 104 With gentle gravity, the priest began. The chapel was filled with faithful who joined in the singing with fervor and compunction. What a contrast! At the altar bright with lights and decorations, the priest in perfect health, singing in a clear and sonorous voice the Preface and the Pater Noster. At his feet, acolytes with childish features marked by death. In the nave, an assemblage in which no face could be looked at without horror. The air was tainted; a fetid odor arose from those unfortunates who prayed so well. And I said to myself that such prayers, mounting to Heaven through the rfediation of such a servant of God, could not fail to be granted. Recognizing the Hawai'ian love of music, Damien made it a daily recreation, forming choirs and community sings. Singing and the band also heightened the celebration of feasts and holidays. Membership in the choir became a great privilege, and practice was solemnly pursued under the trees in the evenings. The band played at everything, even funerals, helping to calm fears and soothe sorrows. There were also four confraternities or devotional societies composed of patients exceptional in their devotion and religious fervor. They were formed to encourage goodwill and brotherhood and undertook works of piety and charity. The Society of Perpetual Adoration constantly adored our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament. Three other groups were of a charitable nature--the Holy Childhood banded together young people and children to help the poor and sick; a men's group under the patronage of St. Joseph also visited the sick; and the last united women under the Blessed Virgin's patronage and assisted other women. Two or three times a year great religious Christi and Christmas. (3) celebrations were held, such as those for Corpus Cemeteries Because the government did not have sufficient funds to buy coffins for all the deceased inmates, people had to pay for their own. Those who died penniless were often buried only in a blanket, if that. The sick were forced to dig graves when called upon, 11. Englebert, Hero of Molokai, pp. 194-95. -- 105 Illustration 13. Corpus Christi celebration near the old Baldwin Home. Corpus Christi is the Feast of the Blessed Sacrament Church, usually celebrated in May or early June. It was prepared for weeks in advance. On the feast day, a magnificent procession would march across the peninsula accompanied by singers and musical instruments, bearing the cross and a gaily decorated portable altar. After the ceremony, a hearty meal was served. Courtesy Hawaii State Archives, Honolulu. an extremely difficult task for those who were crippled. If anyone refused this duty, he could be denied his weekly food ration. The graves were shallow and makeshift and bodies were often washed out during rains or dug up and mutilated and devoured by hogs. To make death a less excruciating and more meaningful rite of passage, Damien formed coffin associations among the people to provide a common fund for proper interment. Damien also laid out a larger, well-enclosed cemetery adjoining St. Philomena which was fenced to prevent encroachment by animals. Here deceased victims, Catholic or not, were decently buried in consecrated ground. Damien acted as undertaker and gravedigger, digging graves at least six feet deep. His spiritual care of the people was utmost in his thoughts and he tirelessly worked on behalf of the Catholic mission, always devising means of extending its influence and increasing its membership. He tried to persuade the people that their present hardships were but preparation for a new and eternally everlasting life in which strife and despair would be absent. Their now deformed bodies would be transfigured and glorified in death. With this aspect before them, the daily funeral ceremonies participated in by two burial associations, which provided music, were imbued with a spirit of solemn festivity. A few musical instruments had been sent by the bishop for the men to play in the processions and ribbons and cloth for banners and ornamentation for the women were contributed by the Catholic sisters. (4) St. Philomena Remodeled It soon became clear to Damien that \"the church of St. Philomena . . . must at all costs be enlarged ten feet at least. II12 In the winter of 1876 this remodeling was undertaken. 12.

Brother Joseph Dutton's description of this picture states that Damien's house stood about where the cross mark is in the foreground (just above the rock). \"We moved that gate and changed the walls so as to enclose much more ground. . . .'I The cross part of the church (with the twelve-light windows) was built by Brother Bertrant. \"There was a door at your right hand. Father Damien closed it and put this nave [with the arched door] and steeple on, the chapel forming the transepts.

In April of 1877 he stated, \"During the winter I worked hard to enlarge my church and build a pretty tower. I' 14 The altar at the east end was fashioned by Father Damien out of whatever materials were handy. (5) A Church at Kalaupapa By early November 1873 Father Damien had built another chapel, largely by himself, at Kalaupapa so that Catholics living there could also attend church. 15 Damien mentioned the structure in a letter to Father Pamphile: I have just built another chapel, two miles from this [St. Philomena], at the other end of the settlement. This chapel costs me 1 ,50!& francs, without counting my work as carpenter. . . . wrote that Its dedication was quite an affair, for Peter Kaeo 13.

This building also had to be enlarged, as, according to Damien, in 1881 He [coadjutor-Bishop] received their request favorably, and commissioned me to add to the old chapel three arms, so as to form a cross. Already a portion of the timber necessary for the work has arrived; for here all t&e buildings are of wood, because of the frequent earthquakes. A letter from Father Albert Montiton--a Frenchman who joined Damien in 1881 --written from Kalaupapa in 1883, stated that the church had lately been doubled in size. Father Damien did all the carpentry work with the aid of a few residents. 19 Father Albert then painted the church in bright colors. To make it easier for the sick to attend sermons, the number of meeting places was increased. Gatherings were held at Kalaupapa, at the hospital, at St. Philomena, and on a plain where immoral dances used to be held. Damien stated : On Sunday afternoons we have meetings for the sick, directed by prayer leaders. Four or five houses at Kalawao are filled to overflowing. After Mass, baptisms and dinner, I go over to Kalaupapa where I hold three meetings; one for the natives who 17.

(6) A Wider Ministry Damien's initial work was not confined solely to the settlement. He had, however, been forced to put off visiting the natives beyond the @ because of the pressing needs of his immediate flock. Disregarding the restrictions imposed on his traveling about the island, he eventually scaled the cliffs over a rough trail and visited the other parts of the island. Realizing that there were enough Catholics to justify 'establishment of a new parish, he wrote the bishop and suggested that another missionary be sent to administer to these people so that he could devote all his time to the settlement where he was most needed and where his presence caused less alarm to the Board of Health. Monsignor Maigret obliged by sending a Dutch priest, Father Andre' Burgermann, in February 1874. After Father Andre' arrived, he stayed at Kalawao while Damien journeyed to the southern coast of the island and built a new church in Burgermann's district at Kalua'aha. On its completion, Damien returned to Kalawao, and from then until about June 1878 his parish was restricted to the peninsula. From June 1878 to June 1880, Father Andre' preached at Kalaupapa, and the care of the southern district once more fell to Father Damien. In July 1880 Father Andre' was directed to leave Moloka'i, and for the next fifteen months Damien again had charge of the entire island. 21 Beginning on September 8, 1881, an ill priest, Father Albert Montiton, stayed at Kalaupapa until February 2, 1885, from which time on Damien was alone until the arrival of Father Louis-Lambert Conrardy in May 1888, who was with Damien at his death. To facilitate passage up and over the pali after the law of absolute exclusion of visitors from the settlement had been 20. Jourdan, Heart of Father Damien, 1960-i p. 214. -- 21 * Englebert, Hero of Molokai, pp. 183-84. -- 117 slightly relaxed in late 1873 to admit medical men and ministers for the exercise of their offices, the government made a bridle path out of the old trail from the top of the pali to the settlement. Because of its steepness, the patients were not strong enough to climb it. 22 3. Construction of New Protestant (Conqregational) Chapel at Kalaupapa By the end of 1876, so many Protestants had moved to the western coast, at Kalaupapa, that the necessity arose to serve their religious needs also. This extended church body was now served by one pastor, who began the practice of holding early Sunday services in the Kalaupapa schoolhouse and who then went back to Kalawao for the regular worship service. The Siloama deacons also frequently met in the Kalaupapa schoolhouse. Discussions soon began over the need for a branch chapel at Kalaupapa. Work on the structure was begun by a carpenter, J . Kanakaole--a patient at the settlement--on May 30, 1878, and it was dedicated on August 3, 1879. On August 29, 1878, the first session of Elders was held in this new chapel at Kalaupapa, a small frame building of unimaginative design called Siloama K, Hale Aloha--\"New -- Si loama, Beloved House. 'I By 1880 plans were being formulated for rebuilding the old Siloama Church at Kalawao. This construction did take place, enlarging the structure and rebuilding it to the extent of placing the front door facing west instead of south toward the pali, raising the belfry, and tapering the steeple. A contemplated parsonage was not added. Lumber for that structure was later used in enlarging, or rebuilding, the new Siloama at Kalaupapa. It was that new chapel, forty-five by twenty feet, that was rededicated in September 1885. By 1890 the Kalaupapa chapel needed enlarging and a tin roof, and Rudolph Meyer took charge of the alteration work. The New Siloama chapel was also repaired around 1903 or 1904 after a storm demolished the belfry and steeple. 22. Father Pamphile, Life and Letters d Father Damien, p. 96. -- 118 Illustration 18. Siloama Hou, Hale Aloha, Kalaupapa, no date, but supposedly ca. 1895, after the tin roof had been added. About 1903, the steeple was ripped off in a windstorm.

Description of \"Leper Asylum of Molokai,\" 1874 In April 1874 King KalZkaua and his Queen visited Kalaupapa peninsula where the assembled residents greeted them on the beach with a hearty welcome. After a brief but emotional address to their diseased subjects, their Majesties returned to the steamer and to Honolulu. Accompanying the royal couple were members of the Board of Health and some newspaper reporters. Brief descriptions of the two settlements were later submitted. At Kalaupapa: \"Here is a store-house or two, and a small stone church, erected by the Father Damiens of the Catholic Mission. . . .'I 23 At Kalawao was a hospital compound comprised of about twelve whitewashed wooden buildings enclosed by a fence. In the center of the square were the office buildings --the dispensary and the office of the superintendent where the accounts and records of the settlement were kept, where \"court\" was held, and where a post office was located. Tobacco was grown in the area and sold to parties in Honolulu. Three houses of worship existed: the Catholic Church at Kalaupapa, and the Catholic (St. Philomena) and Protestant (Siloama) churches at Kalawao. Two schools operated at Kalawao, in which the children were taught Hawai'ian. It was stated that about 184 original inhabitants of the peninsula were still around and very troublesome, eating food intended for the patients, refusing to do any work in return, and pasturing their animals on government land. 24 C. Leprosy Settlement in 1876 1. Visit of \"Committee of Thirteen\" In June 1876 a special \"Committee of Thirteen,\" leading members of the legislature officially charged with the task of investigating 23. \"The Leper Asylum of* Molokai, \" The Pacific Commercial Advertiser (Honolulu), April 18, 1874. 24. Ibid. Southwest of the superintendent's house was a jail built by 1873 to confine anybody creating a disturbance or breaking the Board of Health rules. 122 the condition of the residents, landed at Kalaupapa. This committee, in the open air on the lawn of \"Governor\" Bill Ragsdale's cottage, assembled the residents before them and asked them to voice needs and complaints. After this venting of grievances, those who thought themselves free of the disease were asked to step forward. The committee recommended that several of these be examined immediately by the Board of Health members present, assisted by a visiting medical expert from outside the islands, Dr. G.W. Woods of the U.S.S. Lackawanna. On the basis of this impromptu inspection, two cases were authorized to be returned to Honolulu for further study. 25 2. Notes by Dr. G.W. Woods Dr. Woods, a medical inspector in the U.S. Navy at the time of his visit to the settlement, was working on a report on leprosy for the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery. After accompanying the \"Committee of Thirteen, 'I he penned the following description of the peninsula. At Kalawao was the central village, in which were located the \"governor's\" (resident superintendent's) residence, the government store, the hospital, and several churches. The superintendent's house was described as a simple bungalow with three rooms opening on a verandah, at the end of which was an isolated room expressly built and furnished for the representative of the Board of Health to occupy when he made his regular visits and had to stay overnight. The bedding and furniture in that room were carefully protected from contamination. Father Damien was described as architect, carpenter, painter, nurse and priest to the sick and dying, dresser of wounds, and teacher of temperance, morals, family life, cleanliness, gardening, cooking, and avoidance of vices. Woods described St. Philomena as crowded and ill ventilated: \"the cubic air space limited, and the stifling hot atmosphere was so pervaded and heavy with the offensive odor of 25. Korn, News from Molokai, pp. 281-82. -- 123 decomposing purulent matter that it was with the greatest difficulty the rebellious stomach could be controlled.\" 26 D. Report of the Special Sanitary Committee on the State of the Leprosy Settlement at Kalawao, 1878 In a continuing attempt to better analyze the state of affairs at the settlement, another special committee was appointed by the legislative assembly in 1878. For this visit the residents were again assembled and briefed by Walter M. Gibson, chairman of the committee, and other members as to the purpose of their visit, which was to obtain more information for the legislative assembly in regard to their condition and how it might be improved. From the landing at Kalaupapa, committee members rode on horses to the hospital at Kalawao to carry on the investigation. There again the residents were invited to voice grievances and come forward to be examined if they felt they were being wrongfully detained. While at the settlement the committee members listened to the statements of more than thirty people, visited the hospital wards, the dwellings outside the hospital, and the settlement store, watched the butchering of animals in the slaughterhouse, and the burial of a resident. It was noted that most people lived in cabins or huts they built themselves of materials they had purchased and shipped to the settlement. The rich soil in the area was producing sweet potatoes, corn, beans cabbages, and tobacco. 27 Despite the generally good appearance of the settlement, reforms were obviously needed in connection with housing; food, both quantity and method of distribution; clothing; and medical treatment. The most urgent need was for \"a large-minded, philanthropic, 26. G.W. Woods, \"Reminiscences of a visit, in July, 1876, to the Leper Settlement of Molokai ,\" manuscript, Hawaiian Mission Children's Society, pp. 5-10. 27. \"Report of the Special Sanitary Committee on the State of the Leper Settlement at Kalawao,\" supplement to The Pacific Commercial Advertiser (Honolulu), June 8, 1878. 0 I I l 124 energetic, professional superintendent or governor.\" 28 Also mandatory were a resident physician and medical staff. In 1878 the Board of Health reported that there were 129 big and small frame houses and 171 big and small grass houses in the Settlement. Only 5 or 6 of all the dwellings were privately owned. The population of Kalawao on April 1, 1878, was 692. 29 As a result of the report of the Special Sanitary Committee, the legislative assembly of 1878 gave the condition of the residents special attention and appropriated large sums of money for their treatment and care. Reforms included improved dwellings, additional and more varied food, and gratuitous provision of items necessary to improve lighting and cleanliness, such as lamp oil, soap, and whitewash. The new houses were either built by the Board of Health or were built and owned by the people themselves. By 1886 all the grass houses at the settlement had disappeared. 30 E. Report of Nathaniel B. Emerson, Medical Superintendent of the Leprosy Settlement, 1880 During the first few years at the settlement, no doctors or other medical personnel were provided, although the resident superintendents evidently made some distribution of medicine as necessary. This was primarily due to the fact that the disease was regarded as incurable, and also because in the beginning there were other more pressing problems that could more easily be addressed. Also the generally unpleasant surroundings and lack of medical equipment and facilities made it difficult through the years to attract and keep such 28.

The sick also had native drugs to rely upon, and many of them preferred treatment by kahunas to being under the care of a foreign doctor. Leprosy was not the only illness plaguing these people, however, for they were subject to bowel and lung infections, fevers, ulcers, and sores that needed constant attention. Father Damien, upon his arrival, had tried to fill this void as best he could. A William Williamson, a white man who had come to the settlement after contracting leprosy while nursing the sick as a doctor's assistant at Kalihi, taught Damien some of the rudiments of medical care. He was put in charge of the hospital, while Damien tended to those living in their own homes. From 1874 to 1878 Damien was essentially the only doctor present. Even after the arrival of doctors, who at first did not reside on the island but put in only occasional appearances, he continued to help administer care--preparing potions, disinfecting sores, bandaging limbs, and even performing some surgery. During this time he tried to make use of new drugs he heard about that reportedly had beneficial effects on leprosy patients. The first semi-resident doctor finally arrived in 1879 in the person of Nathaniel B. Emerson, son of a Protestant missionary. He reported that on the first of January 1880 there were 717 residents above one year of age in the settlement. He also stated that after his arrival, efforts were constantly made to improve the people's physical condition by bettering their food rations, by encouraging cleanliness in their homes, and by administering to them medically as much as possible for the relief of their various maladies. With the coming of cold damp weather there were signs of chills, fever, malaise, and general pains. Although there did appear to be means of assuaging the miseries and accompanying pains of leprosy, no cure as yet seemed imminent. As Gavan Daws has noted, Indeed, the medical treatments for leprosy . . . were wildly heterogeneous, hopeful perhaps, but feeble--palliatives at best. There were various kinds of patent medicines in bottles, pills, poultices, dietary recommendations (farinaceous foods, cod-liver oil, measured doses of strychnine), and an extraordinary number of things, soothing and stinging, to rub on the skin: beeswax and lard; salicylic acid followed by a solution of 126 - l arsenite of potash; a mixture of tobacco juice and papaya juice; the lotion of corrosive sublimate that Damien used on his problematical yellowish spots in 1876; a blend of dog manure and molasses. These were haole decoctions. The Hawaiian kahuna had their own applications: wild ginger, turmeric, mountain apple, and on, and on, another endless list. The line between practical folk medicine and fol%.,magic ran erratically back and forth between the two cultures. In April 1879 Damien received from China a large quantity of Hoang-Nan pills, made from a creeping vine, which had been praised as a cure for leprosy. Trial of the drug showed only that it was a tonic in some cases, providing renewed vigor; in others it quickly produced depressing effects. 32 F. Orphanages Established Although Father Damien loved all his parishioners, he took special interest in the welfare of children. Many of them had been separated from their parents at a very young age and upon reaching the settlement had no one to care for them. Before Damien's arrival they had been forced to subsist as best they could, and suffered greatly as virtual slaves to patients who \"adopted\" them. Damien immediately took these children under his wing. To maintain a closer supervision over the young girls, Damien erected an orphanage for them. This girls' home was only a short distance from the later one for boys, but on the other side of the street. In February 1878 Father Damien wrote: I have a small orphanage for young leper girls. An aged widow, who is not sick, is their cook and mother. Although 31. 32. Report of N.B.

We have also planted a big field of potatoes as a reserve when the rations don't get here on time. Some charitable souls send me bundles of cIoj$es which come to me through the Mother Superior in Honolulu. In mid-1879 Damien built a boys' home near the rectory with a kitchen and dormitory for twelve boys. It became such a popular place that even adults without relatives or friends asked to live there. A larger dormitory, twenty by forty feet, had to be built north of the first one. Damien at first built one school for the children, but in 1880 built another because of the large number of pupils. 34 At the boys' school Damien started giving religious instruction, but was ordered to desist by the board in order to preserve neutrality toward religion. These establishments for boys and girls were institutions and were successful because interest in the young people of the colony. This additional responsibility was who was hard pressed to find funds to pay forerunners of much larger of Damien's intense personal quite a strain for the priest, personnel to cook, supervise, and attend to all the other necessary chores, plus purchase clothes and other items. He managed, however, with help from the board and charities and by raising and selling a few crops. Dr. Mouritz wrote: Thirty years ago [I8851 there were many orphans at the leper Settlement in the care of kokua families, but most were cared for by the Catholic mission, under the supervision of Father Damien, at Kalawao, and I claim this was one of the finest works that this priest undertook and carried out. Father Damien's orphanage was comprised of thirty orphan boys and twelve orphan girls, and more thas half these children had a leper father and also a leper mother. 33.

Jourdan, Heart of Father Damien, 1960, p. 176. -- 128 Princess Liliuokalani, after her visit in 1881, reported The next subject which engaged the attention of the party was an inspection of the schools under the charge of Rev. Father Damien. The buildings occupied for this purpose are supplied by the Board of Health, one of which is used for a boys' school and the other for girls, being situated in near proximity, and on the opposite sides of the road. Both are within the vicinity of the mission church. In the girls' school are sixteen pupils in all, ranging in age from nine to seventeen years. . . . Out of these children there were four between nine and eleven years of age who exhibited no external signs of the disease; but one, upon careful inspection by Dr. Arning, was declared to be in the incipient state of disease. In the boys' school were twenty-six pupils, all of whom were well marked with the disease. The pupils of each school are separately lodged and fed. They are all either orphans or friendless, and under the immediate 38 amien and a native woman named Kuilia, not G. Report of Dr. Charles Neilson, Kalawao, 1880 In 1880 Dr. Charles Neilson was sent by the Board of Health to make a medical inspection of Kalawao. I n the report, and as outlined below, he describes some of the buildings in the settlement and comments on several aspects of life there. 1. Hospital Compound This complex consisted of a dispensary, thirty by twenty feet; four barracks, each thirty by eighteen feet; seven other small houses, each ten by twelve feet; and a small cook house. The buildings, located on about three-fourths of an acre, were partially enclosed by a pit ket fence. The fence and buildings were whitewashed, the latter inside and outside. Administration staff at the settlement included a native acting hospital steward, a native clerk of the store and hospital, 36. Ibid., p. 177. 129 and a native sheriff, all leprosy victims, plus three policemen, one harbor master, four butchers, and one cartman. 2. Water Supply Neilson also visited Kalaupapa on this trip, where he said he found many of the people preferring to live near the sea in their grass huts, their diversions being bathing and fishing. They drank the brackish water left behind in the depressions of the rocks by the washing of the sea and by rainfall. The main water supply was derived from the spring at WaihZinau, although in dry seasons residents at Kalaupapa had to go to Kalawao to get water, which they brought back in coal oil tins and paint buckets. The water supply at Kalawao came from Waimanu gulch (up Wai'ale'ia Valley) through one-inch iron piping that originated at the reservoir in the gulch and ended at Kalawao. From there it was conveyed as far as the superintendent's quarters by means of three-fourths-inch-diameter iron pipe. There were nine faucets between the reservoir and the superintendent's quarters to supply water to the patients and horses and cattle in the area. 37 H. Royal Visit of 1881 In 1881 King KalZkaua embarked on a tour of the world. His Queen, Kapiolani, a shy and retiring' person, remained in Honolulu but did not wish to assume the royal duties in his absence. The king's sister, Princess Liliuokalani, therefore, became regent and was responsible for many improvements in administration during that time. For the previous few years the story of Moloka'i and Father Damien had been spreading around the world, and it is not surprising that the regent's curiosity and interest had been aroused enough to prompt her to visit the settlement. 37. Report of Dr. Chas. Neilson [medical officer in charge and general superintendent], Kalawao, Molokai, Sept. 21, 1880, in Leprosy in Hawaii, -- 1886, pp. 100-103. 0 130 In great excitement Damien and his parishioners built triumphal arches and a special pavilion where their guests would eat and rest. A choir of girls practised traditional songs and sagas of Hawai'i. Greeted upon her arrival on September 15 by Damien and about seven hundred residents, the princess was moved to tears by the sight of all her suffering subjects, many terribly ravaged by the advanced stage of their disease. Guided by Mr. Meyer and Father Damien, Liliuokalani was escorted through the settlement, where she observed the houses, hospital, orphanages, churches, rectory, and store. The visit brought Damien and his people even more *publicity, for the princess had been accompanied by several reporters. Throughout the world people began collecting money and clothes for the needy residents. The royal visit also won the colony a powerful advocate at court, which assured even more help in the supplying of basic needs. During the visit, Damien was declared a Knight of the Order of KalBkaua, a decoration the humble man seldom wore. 38 The honor was in appreciation of his heroic and self-denying labors among the people of the settlement. I. Report of the President of the Board of Health, 1882 The primary problem noted by the Board of Health this year was the continuing existence of kuleanas on the peninsula in defiance of the isolation law. Because they were private property and the government had no rights over them, friends of the exiles gathered there and the sick visited at night. Dr. Emerson visited the settlement in March 1882 and reported that the patients and kijkuas were raising vegetables, fowl, and pigs, for their own needs and also to sell. Next to the mountains sweet potato, bananas, sugar cane, onions, beans, and cabbages were being grown. Pa'i '2 was furnished by contractors from the nearby valleys of Pelekunu, Wailau, and Halawa, while 38. Rev. Morgan Costelloe, Leper Priest of Molokai (Dublin: The Catholic Truth Society of Ireland. John English & Co., Ltd., Wexford, Ire., 1965), pp. 22-23. 131 cultivated by the board in Waikolu Valley. The flow of water from Wai'ale'ia Valley was frequently impeded because the small pipes were often choked with sand and mud, and the dam leaked. Kalaupapa residents still fetched water from Waihanau Stream. The plains were covered with a rich growth of mZinienie that supported several hundred horses. 39 J. Arrival in Hawai'i of the Sisters of St. Francis 1. Much Charitable Aid Extended to Dami.en The problem of supplying the necessities of life to the residents of Kalawao and Kalaupapa had been met in several ways. People in Honolulu, both Catholics and Protestants, were the first to rally, and continually provided charity. News coverage spread the word of the settlement's needs, and mounting interest spurred generosity. Damien's fellow priests helped as much as they could within the demands of their own mission needs, and the bishop and provincial sent financial help and gifts. Especially beneficial were the Sacred Hearts Sisters in Honolulu. As word of Damien's cause spread across the sea, generous souls in Europe sent gifts through the Catholic Mission. England became especially interested in his work and Protestants and Catholics alike gave generously in admiration of the man.. Americans also, with a great political as well as moral and social interest in the islands, provided publicity and charitable aid and, as other countries did, sent journalists and doctors to visit the settlement. The vast amount of money that came into Damien's hands created problems for him both with his religious superiors and the government bureaucracy. Damien's discretionary powers in doling out the large charitable sums that arrived for Kalawao is an interesting aspect of the administration of the settlement and of Damien's role in it. The administrative situation at the settlement was peculiar. The Hawai'ian 39. Report @ the President c the Board of Health, to the Legislative -- -- Assembly of 1882 (Honolulu, 1882), pp. 46, 64-65. -- 132 government was subsidizing the settlement, and generously, through public funds, but there was no strong administrator there. Damien, by the sheer force of his energy and personality, and because he lived there, became the dominant factor in overseeing th.e welfare of the patients and improvement of their condition. Although the government was providing a great deal of money, it was not enough to cover all the needs of such a large and extensive population. The outpouring of donations from various parties and countries tended to embarrass the government, which felt that these highly publicized donations implied that it was not fulfilling its responsibiIitiPes. (Actually the problem lay not .so much in the size of the government's leprosy appropriations, but in maladministration of the leprosy program. ) The private money and goods received by Damien were not turned over to the Board of Health or to the Catholic church, whi.ch, disturbed by the aggrieved response of the Hawai'ian government to the donations, and by the consequent strain on relations between the government and the Sacred Hearts mission, refused to have anything to do with them. They were, therefore, concentrated solely in Damien's hands. His position was as a middleman, a distributor of supplies impartially where the need was greatest. This flexibility of distribution seemed to be what most of the benefactors desired. This additional charitable aid helped the settlement through times when provisions were late arriving and enabled improvements other than those along officially established lines. 2. Need for Nurses a. Call for Help Sent Out For several years it had been noted that nurses were needed at Kalawao to help those who could not help themselves--the sick and the old and feeble. No serious effort to recruit such individuals had yet been made. In January 1883 Walter Gibson, Minister of Foreign Affairs and president of the Board of Health, appealed to Hermann Koeckemann, Bishop of\"0lb.a; _ I' head of the Cathqlic Mission in Hawai'i, to obtain Sisters .of Ch.arity from one of the many sisterhoods in the United States to come to Hawai'i to help 'care for leprous women and girls. Father Leonor Fouesnel, with a royal. commission from King Kalakaua, was 133 designated as agent to go on this mission. Landing in San Francisco and traveling East, Father Leonor petitioned more than fifty different sisterhoods before a favorable reply was obtained, from the Franciscan Convent of St. Anthony at Syracuse, New York. b. Mother Marianne Cope Responds The reply to the King's emissary was not made lightly, but only after a long, serious debate among the sisterhood. One of the prime supporters of this action was the Mother Superior, Mother Marianne Cope. She had been born Barbara Koob in 1838 in Germany and moved to Utica, New York, with her family when about a year and a half old, in 1840. She entered St. Anthony's Convent of the Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis in Syracuse and underwent novitiate training in St. Francis's Convent there. Professing with the name Sister Mary Anna on November 19, 1862, she early showed abilities as an administrator. 40 With calmness, good sense, firmness, and a kind heart she was able to get cooperation from all around her. Her religious life was a series of administrative appointments, culminating in her being placed in charge of missions in Hawai'i. At the time of Father Leonor's visit, Mother Marianne was the provincial superior. Only six sisters could be spared to go with Mother Marianne, who insisted that as superior of the convent it was her duty to go with the first group of sisters and help them get established. It was not the intent of the convent that she stay in Hawai'i permanently. On October 23, 1883, Mother Marianne and her companions set off for Hawa,i'i, arriving on November 9. Three of the sisters and Mother Marianne went to work at the branch hospital for leprosy victims at 40. In taking the name Sister Mary Anna, Barbara Koob was conforming to the custom of the order, whereby each professed sister received Mary as a first name. Eventually she was referred to as Marianna, but finally decided upon the name Marianne by 1871. Sister Mary Lawrence Hanley, O.S.F., and O.A. Bushnell, A Song g Pilqrimage and Exile: The Life (Chicago: and Spirit $ Mother Marianne G Molokai FrascanieraId Press, 1980), pp. 18-19. 134 ,. Kaka'ako in Honolulu on January 11, 1884, and spent almost five years there. Three others were put in charge of the new hospital at Wailuku on the island of Maui. On April 22, 1885, a second group of sisters arrived from Syracuse as reinforcements. Although in 1885 Mother Marianne was still identified as \"Provincial Superior,\" a new title of \"Commissary Provincial of the Sandwich Islands\" was soon created for her. Another Mother Provincial was elected in the Syracuse motherhouse that year and Mother Marianne was authorized to stay on in Hawai'i. News continually filtered back to Kaka'ako about conditions at the Moloka'i settlement. The children on the island were in desperate need of care and the venerable Father Damien himself had been diagnosed as having leprosy and obviously had few years left in which to continue his work. Mother Marianne, however, was being kept frantically busy in Honolulu all this time. At one point she had suggested to Walter Gibson that a home for children of leprous parents be built near the sisters' residence in Honolulu. This establishment opened in November 1885 as the Kapiolani Home for Girls. C. themselves not long Father Damien Meets Mother Marianne Symptoms of some sort of infection had manifested after Father Damien's arrival at Kalawao. After about five years of living and working intimately with the leprosy victims he began to suffer \"chills, osteal pains, slight swelling and tenderness of the joints, slight irregular fever, tingling numbness of the extremeties. . . .'I 41 Though his health seemed to improve for a short- while, in the fall of 1881 violent pains in his limbs and numbness returned. About the end of 1882 or start of 1883 his left foot lost feeling, and the next year he was diagnosed as having leprosy. The news was not released outside the Catholic mission. 0 41. Jourdan, Heart of Father Damien, 1960, p. 302. -- 135 About a month before his death, Father Damien dictated a report to Brother Dutton, at the 'request of a leprosy specialist in New York, on the progress of his disease. In the report he stated that from 1864 until 1873, while serving as priest on the island of Hawai'i, he sometimes heard confessions from leprosy victims and ministered to them in their homes. He had had no constant contact, however j until his arrival at Moloka'i. When near to the afflicted on Hawai'i, he had felt a peculiar itching or burning sensation in the face--a sensation he also felt at Kalawao, in his legs and face, for the first two or three years. Although these are not regarded today as symptoms of leprosy, Damien was sure that the disease was in his system within the first three' years of his residence on Moloka'i. 42 He quite possibly already had the disease when he came to Kalawao. In his first days at the settlement Damien was very careful iri his dealings with the residents. He preferred sleeping in the open to sharing anyone's' hut, he had his food prepared by a \"clean\" cook, and he did not allow residents to enter his. abode. Before long, however, his caution grew lax and his attention to personal hygiene waned. His house was ,opened to the settlement, and especially to his orphaned children. He shared food, drink, and 'personal possessions freely' with the contaminated, and even lived in the midst of- their burial ground. \" Because, Damien was so busy and under such pressure, he had little time for health considerations and seemed to prefer living side by side with the people he loved, taking no precautions. The primitive conditions at the settlement and the lack of water hindered personal cleanliness for victims and priest alike. Most of the early residents were. in an advanced stage of the disease when they arrived and yet Damien relaxed his initial precautions on interaction with them for fear of offending them. His powerful compassion overshadowed 42. Ibid., p. 449. 136 l his own prudence. And maybe he felt that he would not be able to escape the contagion anyway. He certainly was resigned to the fact when the disease was officially diagnosed in 1885, accepting it as a natural ) consequence of the task he had committed himself to twelve years earlier. With his life slowly ebbing away, it became imperative for Damien to find someone to whom he could entrust his orphaned children and youths. In 1886, when, against the wishes of the mission and Walter Gibson, Damien journeyed to Honolulu to study the Japanese treatment of leprosy recently introduced at Kaka'ako Hospital, he talked to the Franciscan Sisters there about the settlement and his work. Until 1888, however, his pleas for sisters to be assigned to the orphanage went unanswered. But an opportunity suddenly appeared with the offer in April 1888 by a wealthy Honolulu man to subsidize an asylum for female leprosy patients at Kalaupapa. 43 Because the benefactor, Charles R. Bishop, wanted the institution to be run by sisters, and because of a rumor that some Anglican sisters were ready to volunteer, Bishop Hermann lost no time in requesting that some of the Kaka'ako sisters go at once to Moloka'i. At the same time, the Board of Health decided to support only one place of treatment --the Moloka'i settlement--and to maintain only a receiving and shipping station in Honolulu, at Kalihi. The buildings at Kaka'ako would be removed, and thus the sisters freed of their responsiblities at that place. In a further attempt to help persuade the sisters, Minister of the Interior Lorrin A. Thurston explained to their superior, Mother Marianne, that one of the great hardships of the settlement had been the lack of a proper separate residence for single women and girls. In inquiring if the sisters would be willing to assume charge of the new 43. L.A. Thurston, Minister of the Interior, to Hon. C.R.

The number of residents was anticipated to be between 100 and 150.44 Having already become interested in the settlement through their conversations with Father Damien, this inducement was all the sisters needed. Thus it was that on November 14, 1888, Mother Marianne and Sisters Leopoldina and Vincentia finally set foot on Kalaupapa. K. Impressions of Leprosy Settlement, 1884 1. Report of Dr. J. H. Stallard Dr. J.H. Stallard, a member of the College of Physicians in England, was sent by A.S. Cleghorn, a member of the Board of Health, to the settlement to investigate the causes of the various complaints made by residents for better rations and food. He first visited the Branch Hospital at Kaka'ako, established for the purpose of segregating recent doubtful cases of leprosy for careful medical treatment, and then the settlement at Moloka'i. He arrived at the latter on March 5, 1884. The settlement at that time contained 445 males and 300 females. With the kijkuas and their children, the total population numbered about 1,000 people. Stallard stated that he was most gratified at the cheerful and contented population, the entire absence of grumbling or complaint, the cleanliness of their persons and the comfort and tidiness of all their dwellings, the many neat little plots of onions, sweet potatoes, tobacco and flowers in front of many of their houses and above all, the general possession of a horse and little articles of personal adornment; happiness and freedom. $xerywhere we saw the appearance of 44.

Dr. Stallard's Report [March 12, 18841, in Mouritz, \"Path of the --- Destroyer,\" p. 316. 140 Stallard did, however, condemn what he considered to be the defective and incomplete administration of the settlement, resulting in insufficient food, improper diet, neglect, total lack of preparation for newcomers, and the improper administration of justice. 46 Dr. Mouritz stated that the \"Mokolii\" [t ransport vessel] could and ought to have made direct trips from Honolulu to Kalaupapa, but the Board of Health . . . did not see the necessity of this, hence the steamer made the whole circuit of the island of Molokai before coming to Kalaupapa. This arrangement caused untold misery and suffering. The S.S. Mokolii was small . . . had no accommodation for passengers well or sick, excepting on deck. This vessel was far from speedy . . . yet this miserable litt& tub . . . was kept on the Molokai route for fully 25 years. Sometimes leprosy victims died immediately after reaching Kalaupapa due to exhaustion from the advanced state of their illness and to seasickness. 2. Visit of Queen Kapiolani On July 21, 1884, a royal party--composed of Queen Kapiolani, Princess Liliuokalani, and Dr. Eduard Arning, a young German bacteriologist brought to the islands in 1883 by the Board of Health to conduct research on leprosy-- arrived at Kalaupapa to assess the condition of the settlement. Many grievances were transmitted to the queen, involving inadequate food supplies, want of proper care and nursing, and lack of enough clothing. Some of the places visited are described below. 46. Ambrose Hutchison, a patient and later the resident superintendent of the settlement from 1884 to 1897, stated that he was practically dumped on the treacherous, rocky shore at Kalaupapa, no provision having been made for the reception of him and his fellow passengers. Evidently Honolulu authorities often failed to contact the settlement in advance of the arrival of a new group. This unpreparedness was one of the reasons people dreaded being taken to Moloka'i and seriously impaired enforcement of the segregation policy. 47. Mouritz, \"Path of the Destroyer, 'I p. 208. --- 141 a. Landing Place One of the most discussed problems had to do with the distribution of supplies. Pa'i 'ai was landed at Wai kolu gulch, about -- five miles from Kalaupapa, and had to be packed that distance by patients, usually without the use of any type of conveyance. For the weak, this was almost an impossibility. The road to the landing was practically impassible in good weather and very dangerous in stormy weather when packhorses could be washed away and drowned. A proposed new landing was located only about half a mile from the hospital. The present road to the landing place was, for two miles of its length, over lava rock and overhung by precipices from which frequent showers of stones fell upon the road below. The road also frequently washed out. b. Jail, or Lock-up This building, in one corner of the hospital yard, measured about ten by fifteen feet and contained two separate compartments six feet long and nine feet wide. Ventilation was provided by small iron grates on the leeward side of the building. C. Slaughterinq Place The arrangements for slaughtering were described as primitive and the water supply as insufficient for cleaning the meat. A new reservoir was in process of construction near the slaughtering place to be filled from pipes connected to the main valley supply. d. Schools These buildings were supplied by the Board of Health, one for boys and one for girls, close together and on opposite sides of the road, both near the Catholic mission church. The girls' school had sixteen pupils, the boys' twenty-six. The pupils of each school were separately fed and lodged. They were all orphans or friendless and under the care of Father Damien and a non-leprous native woman. 142 e. Water Supply The old and still current water system had its source in Wai'ale'ia Valley. The board now felt that this system was inadequate to the needs and had proposed bringing the water from Waikolu Valley, two miles farther on, where the pa'i 'ai supply was landed and - distributed. A great need was mentioned for wholesome water to drink and to use for food preparation. Kalaupapa had several springs situated on the beach, but residents were compelled to use brackish water from a well near the beach, in which the water was often rendered unfit for use by overflow of the tide into the well. Before leaving Kalawao, the royal party planted several seeds of alligator pears and mangoes taken from a large supply of fruit seeds brought by the queen for distribution to the people. (The royal party had stayed at Kalaupapa in a new home just built for use by visiting physicians. ) f. Recommendations for Improvement That trip brought great attention to the situation at the settlement because it made a detailed study of needs and recommended improvements that should be made immediately. These included: putting into operation the proposed plan of bringing water from Waikolu Valley and extending it to Kalaupapa where only brackish water was then obtainable; installing a resident physician and an assistant near the hospital to administer to treatable illnesses such as diarrhea and dysentery; increasing the hospital accommodation to 200 patients; bringing in Sisters of Mercy to help in nursing and care of the hospital ; 143 providing an ambulance for transportation of crippled patients and two spring wagons for delivery of beef and JI& 'g to the residents; subsidizing a small steamer to transport cattle, firewood, poi, and patients; compelling helpless lepers to go to the hospital; providing a building in or near Honolulu to be staffed by a physician and nursing staff for the treatment of children in the incipient stages of leprosy and also as an asylum for healthy children; and increasing the supply of food and clothing. Other suggestions involved grazing a moderately large herd of beef cattle and milk cows on the pasture lands of the settlement, cultivating Waikolu and Wai'ale'ia valleys, and abandoning the Waikolu landing place and constructing a landing nearer Kalawao. 48 During this visit by the queen, under-superintendent Ambrose Hutchison, possibly at Damien's instigation, pleaded for separation of those children born of diseased parents who appeared to be entirely free from all symptoms of the disease and their placement in a separate institution. The queen followed up on this recommendation, lending the project her patronage, and with the help and support of Dr. Arning, Walter Gibson, and Mother Marianne, the Kapiolani Home for Girls mentioned earlier was established at Kalihi near Honolulu. 48.

Charles Warren Stoddard's Visit to Moloka'i Charles Stoddard, a friend of Damien's, a convert, and professor of English literature at Notre Dame University, first visited the leprosarium in 1868 and then returned in 1884. His book The Lepers of Molokai did much to establish Father Damien's position in public esteem. Stoddard kept a diary of his visit to Moloka'i in 1884, excerpts from which provide additional information on conditions and facilities at the settlement: a. Kalawao Settlement Oct. 7, 1884: We saw the little chapel and most of the private dwellings where families live; the girls' home with a new dining room which Father Damien has been putting up with his own hands, and the few remaining grass huts which are occupied by the older natives. b. St. Philomena Church Oct. 8, 1884: the place [St. Philomena] was dingy and dirty; the stations were tilted; the little interior painted in bad taste; the holy water font was a tin cup; some rosaries were scattered about, and a few torn catechisms. The priest's robes were singularly clean and beautiful, without being extravagant. The chalice was small, the altar decorations cheap and tawdry; the candles tilted all ways. The acolytes --two--wore no robes, although there were several of the scarlet ones hanging within the church. C. Kalawao Guest House Oct. 8, 1884: Then home to dinner, and after it Father Damien again appears with his little trap and we start for Kalaupapa. A house which was built for the reception of guests three years ago, in which the lepers were to be looked at through a picket partition, is about to be utilized. It will be carted on wheels to Kalaupapa and become a lodge for freshly arrived natives and for freight. An expensive undertaking; the house cost $100 in the beginning and it will cost $200 or $300 to move it--the road has been straightened qgd broadened in places to allow the 24 x 40 foot house to pass. 49. In 1882 the Board of Health had given instructions to the superintendent of the settlement to erect a building near the landing, surrounded by a picket fence, where visitors could be permitted to see 145 d. Father Damien's House Oct. 9, 1884: At Father Damien's house, alone upstairs--in Kolawao [ sic] --he reading in his office below while I am left with a bottle of claret and a biscuit to write my notes. e. Kalaupapa Settlement: Dock, St. Francis Church, Racetrack, Cemetery Oct. 8, 1884: Down we went to Kalaupapa; it looked dreary enough from the hill--pali --but we found it full of pretty white cottages, bright, sunshiny, and with an air of prosperity which perhaps is partly due to the newly constructed dock--an affair that is warranted to go to pieces in the first heavy gale. Oct. 8, 1884: His [Father Albert Montitonls] little house is charming, far prettier than Father Damien's; flowers grow before it; it was prettily painted and neatly furnished, and as bright and sunshiny as the good old Father himself--who is, notwithstanding, an invalid ! Books were on the table, papers; pictures upon the wall; curtains at the windows; beer and wine also, and the most genial hospitality. His church is like a little Chinese showbox full of color; odd combinations of color and grotesque but pretty patterns upon wall and ceiling. . . . Oct. 8, 1884: Then we drove to the farther end of the village--but not till we had seen the new dock! The dock is primitive and pretty, full of huge nails and heavy timbers, but in storm times the great seas cover it, the deep water about it is like crystal, and at the bottom among the rocks there are clusters of coral that look like white cactus flowers. Three lepers were fishing; lepers were bathing up and down the rocky coast; lava rocks in strange forms receive the sea and shoulder it back again while it is white with rage. A lifeboat is here ready to be slid down a rude incline. The shoreline is pretty. . . . Oct. 8, 1884: We drive upon the race track--a capital stretch of turn with a ridge of grasses between it and the sea. The hour was delicious. The new cemetery, quite Frenchy with its elaborate entrance, filigree woodwork painted in black and white, and its tall, slender and very graceful cross in its very center. Beyond it are native houses, some of them of grass 49. (Cont'd) their relatives without touching them.

Report of J. H . Van Giesen, 1884 Henry Van Giesen, appointed by the Board of Health as superintendent of the Kaka'ako Branch Hospital, mentioned that near the Kalaupapa boat landing was a spring of brackish water, which was the main supply of those in that settlement. The well was lined with stones al I around. The Kalawao water came from Wai'ale'ia Valley where it was contained behind a cement dam. A I$-inch-diameter pipe led down a few hundred feet, then became l-inch diameter to Kalawao, where it went past Damien's house to the hospital yard and doctor's house. Along the way were five faucets where water could be acquired by patients and stock. A new cookhouse had been installed in the hospital yard. 51 L. Leprosy Settlement, 1885 1. Visit by President of Board of Health In the exercise of his duties as president of the Board of 0 Health, Walter Murray Gibson paid a visit to the settlement on November 2, 1885, and in a subsequent report he commented on several of the facilities : a. Hospital Compound (1) Dormitories and Cottages The hospital complex consisted at this time of fourteen detached cottages and assorted buildings in a grassy enclosure. 50.

The residents of Kalaupapa enjoyed horse racing. Damien felt that it stimulated blood circulation, slowed the progress of the disease, and lessened its pains. 51.

Courtesy Hawaii State Archives, Honolulu. 148 There the worst cases of leprosy were lodged and cared for. Apartments in which they stayed were clean and well ventilated. There were fifty inmates at the hospital, of whom eight were females. (2) Kitchen and Yard The neat kitchen within the hospital enclosure contained a large army cook stove and other necessary appliances. Only food for hospital inmates and attendants was cooked there. Fuel, consisting of kukui wood, was procured in the gulches, cut, and delivered to the hospital. The poi house in the enclosure was where the stores of pali 'ai or pounded w, - packaged in twenty-five pound bundles, was stored. The hospital yard was well covered with grass and flowers. Honeysuckle flourished, while banana and papaya trees furnished fruit for the inmates. b. Store and Dispensary The store was across the road from the hospital and was managed by a white leprosy victim. The dispensary was in a detached cottage outside the hospital grounds. There Dr. Arthur Mouritz, a physician on Oahu, who had come to the settlement as resident doctor in May 1884, dispensed medicine. The difficulty of getting patients to follow instructions on medicine and sanitation was pointed out: the native Hawai'ians still often had more faith in their native doctors and sorcerers than in scientific treatment by foreigners. C. Damien's Mission In following the road through Kalawao, Gibson noted the numerous frame houses on either side, some encircled by flowers and shrubs within their enclosures. St. Philomena was surrounded by flowers and adjoined by the Boys' Home, containing thirty children, and Father Damien's residence. A little farther east toward the bluff was the Girls' Home, with twelve residents, under the care of a married leprous couple. Close by was the newly altered Calvinist church. 150 d. Church at Kalaupapa At a \"spacious\" and \"tastefully decorated\" church at Kalaupapa, Damien conducted services every Sunday after preaching at Kalawao. . He also had a cottage at Kalaupapa, and a school. 52 2. Description by Robert J. Creighton, Editor of \"The Pacific Commercial Advertiser\" As the number of residents on the peninsula increased, some had gradually started to move over toward the Kalaupapa side. When Damien first arrived there was no road on the peninsula, so he had cut out a path to make transportation of supplies and people from the Kalaupapa landing easier. The path proved unusable during the wet season, when it became a sea of mud, as well as during the dry spells when the deep ruts cut in the winter dried into hard furrows. In January 1883 Damien and some helpers from the colony were charged with the task of repairing the government road from Kalawao to Kalaupapa. Upon its completion, it was referred to as the Father Damien Road. Thus the way was prepared for further settlement at Kalaupapa. By 1885 several non-leprous Hawai'ians still lived at Kalaupapa, farming and fishing as their families had been doing for generations. The government was then realizing that the western side of the peninsula was much healthier and therefore a more appropriate location for a leprosarium. Although some landowners could be bought out and moved \"topside,\" others elected to stay until finally evicted in 1895. After 1887, however, the Board of Health began the long process of moving facilities west to Kalaupapa--a transfer that took more than forty years to accomplish. 53 By 1885 Creighton estimated roughly 300 to 400 frame buildings on the peninsula, the settlement being divided into two communities, 52.

Hanley and Bushnell, A Song of Pilgrimage and Exile, p. 286. - 151 the more numerous and more active living at or near the steamer landing at Kalaupapa. There is a \"live public opinion\" at Kalaupapa, which does not exist in such marked degree at Kalawao, where the people are more subdued in manner and tone. Frequent intercourse from without may account for this in part at the former place, but it is also largely owing to the re of a rather numerous class of people who are M. Leprosy Settlement, 1886 1. Report of Father Damien As mentioned earlier in this study, in January 1886 the Board of Health asked Father Damien to submit a report drawn from his long experience among the leprosy patients on Moloka'i. It was hoped that such a document, drawn from someone with an intimate acquaintance with leprosy, would provide medical science with valuable information on the course of the disease in the islands. The final report, dated March 1, 1886, comprised eight chapters dealing with various aspects of settlement life: the necessity of good nourishment and drinking water, of suitable housing and clothing, the benefits of physical exercise and of permitting healthy spouses to live with diseased mates, the good effects of morality and evil effects of vice, and thoughts on the judicious use of medicine to alleviate suffering. Also included was an appendix on the propagation of leprosy. This report, written without flourish or exaggeration, described conditions as Damien had found them and as they were at the present time. His suggestions for improvement showed sound reasoning, and even more important, seemed feasible, and were probably responsible for many ensuing changes and additions, a. \"The Dwellinqs of the Lepers\" Damien estimated the number of houses at Kalawao and Kalaupapa somewhat above 300, nearly all whitewashed. These had 54. Dedication of the Kapiolani Home for Girls (Molokai. Description of the Leper Colony onthis Island. Robert J. Creighton, Editor P. C. Advertiser), p. 38. 152 0 been built at small expense to the government and with the aid of private or charitable resources. Lime had always been supplied free of charge by the board for whitewashing. Although clean and neat, the houses did not have proper ventilation, which created an unpleasant and unhealthy smell. b. \"Exercise for the Lepers\" As more land on the peninsula was annexed to the settlement and made available to the people, traveling increased, and trips between Kalaupapa and Kalawao became healthful exercise as well as a necessity. Such activity was facilitated by an increase in the number of horses on the peninsula. More cultivable land also became available, and more than 200 acres were fenced in along the foot of the mountains. Any person could occupy and cultivate a vacant portion of it at his pleasure, as had been the case at Kalawao where many had squatted in little colonies among the sheltered rocky land some distance from the town and planted and cultivated sweet potatoes. Soon after this large piece of land was opened to cultivation, many began to start a patch of sweet potatoes, which grew abundantly. During the winter when supply boats had difficulty landing, the board was able to procure a weekly supply of potatoes from these farmers and thus prevent a temporary famine. The money given the farmers started to circulate and helped create many other kinds of small industries as well as increasing business at the settlement store. This encouraged others to plant and they soon petitioned the administration to obtain, instead of their weekly ration, its equivalent in money. Some were thereby able to obtain cash to buy little necessary items. This continued for about eight years, the money paid varying in amount according to the potato harvest and the shortness of supply of taro. The system was stopped due to some abuses of it, but Damien believed it should be reinstituted because it was beneficial for the health and morale of the people. Walking, riding horseback, and farming were the healthiest activities of the patients. Such activities might even be 153 slowing down the progress of the disease in many and also preventing the start of other ailments. C. \"The Kokuas or assistants who accompany the Lepers to the Settlement\" On this matter Damien made a strong distinction between married and unmarried k3kuas. He felt that husbands or wives of patients should be allowed to accompany their partners into exile. Forcible separation led to depression and ultimately immorality. Married couples were more resigned to their fate, established a more stable community, and their presence assured good nursing and assistance of the sick. Married kakuas not only helped their mates but also the administration by doing public works for all. The system of allowing marriage partners to accompany diseased mates also removed a potentially dangerous source of the contagion from the community. Damien believed strongly that cohabitation with a leprosy victim made a person a menace to the healthy population, although the disease's contagiousness had never been firmly established. Damien strongly disapproved of unmarried kZkuas settling there because they were generally not faithful in assisting their charges; they were a source of immorality; they were free to leave the place anytime and could spread the disease among healthy people on other islands; and were generally lazy, greedy, and shiftless, in his opinion. The priest recommended only allowing married ko'kuas into the settlement, restricting the duration of temporary visits, and preventing healthy young people from entering the settlement. d. \"Medical Treatment\" Leprosy from times immemorial up to the present, has always been recognized as an incurable disease. In laying my views before your Excellency, with regard to medecine, I must draw distinction between a developed and an incipient case. In regard to the first a judicious medical treatment may be followed UP, with advantage, to ameliorate the condition of a leper, to alleviate his pains, and to stay some what the progress of the disease, but not with the view of obtaining a perfect cure, for such a blessed effect we must look for, and only can hope in a supernatural gift. . . . In regard to an incipient case where the disease is not yet developed, there, in my opinion, with 154 - 0 proper medecine, good diet, cleanness, complete separation from al I leprous persons, and other necessary means, taken with perseverance, there a, the hope to eradicate the disease from the systeT5 or at least its progress entirely checked, may be entertained. 2. Report of R.W. Meyer As mentioned earlier, Rudolph W. Meyer held the position of agent of the Board of Health and superintendent of the settlement from 1866 to his death in 1897. Coming to Hawai'i from Australia, where he had emigrated from Hamburg, Germany, he was well-educated, level -headed, and a stern taskmaster. It may be that living on an isolated island for so long among people he considered mentally and socially inferior made him less flexible and more severe in his dealings with them. His house was at the top of the steep pali, near the beginning of the Kukuihspu'u trail down to the peninsula. From that vantage point he was able to restrict travel down the @ trail through a gate at the top of the cliff. Meyer paid only quarterly visits to the settlement, functioning more as an absentee landlord--a fact that disgruntled many of the patients. He relied for his information on conditions in the settlement on reports by his deputy, or resident, superintendents. Meyer's management of the settlement had already been strongly criticized by Dr. J.H. Stallard in the report of March 12, 1884. Although Meyer made a heated reply in defense of the situation, complaints continued, and in February 1886 Dr. Mouritz was even requested to take over the entire management of the settlement. He promptly declined the offer, being busy as physician and also having no wish to enter into such a difficult office. In April 1886 Meyer submitted a report to the Board of Health outlining conditions at -the settlement since its inception, but, as 55. Damien, \"Personal Experience,\" p. 34. The preceding information was taken from pp. 15, 21-28. 155 pointed out by the secretary of the board, it was not based on intimate observation of conditions or changes because he was not an actual resident of the colony. Even as just general descriptions, however, Meyer's notes provide some interesting information. a. Dwellings There were at this time estimated to be 652 patients and 327 buildings at the settlement, including hospital structures, houses, a store, storehouses, a drug-shop, and five churches (two Catholic, two Protestant, one Mormon). One hundred nine of these buildings belonged to the board, some purchased gradually from the patients but the rest built for them by the board. The rest of the houses (213) were owned by the residents and built at their own expense. The houses were one story, varied in size, but had ample Windows and doors provided ventilation. 56 room. b. Activities Much horseback riding took place and a few patients had carriages. A fairly good band provided music, and activities were carried on much as elsewhere in the islands. C. Hospitals These wooden structures at Kalawao, forty-six feet long by twenty feet wide and nine feet high, housed patients in the advanced stages of the disease. For better ventilation they were unceiled and had short chimneys to promote air currents. There were two rows of bedsteads in the houses with about four feet between them. The 56. Dr. Mouritz mentioned in a report of 1886 that the dwellings were surrounded by stone walls enclosing half an acre or so. Within the enclosures sweet potatoes, bananas, sugar cane, and onions were cultivated to supplement food rations provided by the board. The interiors had little furniture, mats being used as beds and chairs with a few calabashes for food. Furnishings seem to have varied, however, with the personality of the resident. Special Report of. Arthur Mouritz, M.D., Physician to the Leper Settlement and island of Molokai, Jan. 1, 1886, in \"Path of the Destroyer,\" p. 363. --- 156 buildings were whitewashed at least twice a year, inside and outside, and were in the charge of a native steward. Food was prepared for the patients, who received tea or coffee with sugar or milk and other extras. A picket fence surrounded the area of about one and a half acres. Inside the enclosure and in front of the hospital buildings was a garden in which patients planted flowers and vegetables. A cookhouse had been built about eighteen months previously. Despite the hospital's cleanliness and the nursing and medical care given patients, in addition to food, washing, and lodging, few cared to enter it because they did not feel comfortable there. The buildings were usually only partially filled. d. Children Children at the settlement were housed in a variety of ways, Near the Catholic mission at Kalawao were houses for orphan boys and girls and children who had neither parents nor friends at the settlement. Other children lived with their parents or relatives. There were two schools, one at Kalaupapa where a kGkua taught, and one at Kalawao with a teacher who had leprosy. Both leprous and non-leprous children attended the same school, but they were separated within the structure. There were fifty pupils total at this time. Only in two places was segregation of the sexes practiced-- in the hospital barracks and in Father Damien's two orphanages. e. Improvements Made (I) Harbor Rocks in the center of Kalaupapa harbor had caused many shipwrecks in the past and the loss of much valuable property. The rocks had been removed and the landing was considered much safer now. An extensive wharf or boat landing was also built, facilitating the discharge of freight and landing of passengers. (2) Storehouse at Dock A large storehouse was placed at the Kalaupapa landing. One end was used for a drug store and doctor's office for the 0 population living at Kalaupapa. The structure had originally been at 157 Makanalua, a mile or so away, where it was originally intended to house visitors to the settlement to prevent mixing with the patients, but the house had never been used for that purpose. (3) Well House Near the Kalaupapa landing was the well where most people obtained water. Over the well a \"neat little structure\" was erected and a pump was put in. The superstructure helped the looks of the area and provided a resting place and shelter for those coming for water, (4) Physician's House, Kalawao A new dwelling was built at Kalawao for the use of a resident physician. The drug store was moved nearer the hospital. (5) Cookhouse, Hospital Yard A new cookhouse was built in place of the old one that was too small and hard to clean. (6) Reservoir, Kalawao A small reservoir was built near the hospital to provide a supply of water in case of accident or during repairs to the water pipes. (7) Water Supply, Kalawao A couple of thousand feet of the old small pipes at the spring were replaced with larger ones, and the old pipes were used to further extend the system and to provide water to a new slaughterhouse. f. Law and Order A magistrate had been appointed who, although having the authority of a district judge, acted chiefly as a peace arbiter. Crimes were rarely committed, with a short imprisonment the usual punishment. Only a few rules were enforced at the settlement: 158 Illustration 22. Kalawao, no date, but post-1873 because the store is present to the right, and probably after 1886, because that is when a reservoir (possibly the circular stone cistern on the horizon) was built near the hospital.

Each leper has the right to select a building spot wherever he pleases, provided the place is not essential for purposes of the Board of Health, and he is therefore required to notify the superintendent. Each leper on arrival at the Settlement has also the right to select the family or company he desires to live with, provided, however, they do not object to it. If they object, he is given a place with others who are not adverse to it. Lepers building houses at their own expense, have the right to sell those houses again to other lepers, for lepers to live in. All houses built by lepers at their own expense, therefore owned by them, are, nevertheless, considered to be under the control of the Board, if to assert such a control, for good reasons, should become necessary. Lepers trusting one another with money or other things must do so at their own risk, nothing is done for them, officially, by any officer of the Board. Claims against deceased lepers for services rendered during their last illness are respected, if testified to by the leper before death and in presence of the chief officer of the Settlement; and if his heirs do not pay the disputed amount, his property, if he leaves any, is sold and sufficient of the proceeds is paid for such services. The property of a leper who dies without heirs at the Settlement or assigns, is sold by the sheriff of the Board and the proceeds are forwarded to the president of the Board of Health, and the death of the leper is advertised in the papers that his heirs may come forward and claim what he left. Wills left by lepers are also carried out by the Board, provided they are satisfactorily made out and properly witnessed. Drinking intoxicating beverages is forbidden, and persons found drunk are punished with twenty-four hours' imprisonment. Making intoxicating drink from potatoes or ti root is Ii kewise prohibited and punished, and all material used in making the same is confiscated and destroyed. Liquor for the use of lepers and kokuas is not allowed to enter the Settlement, and suspicious looking packages when they come ashore are opened. If liquor is found, it is confiscated and destroyed or sent to Honolulu to the marshal, to whom opium, if found, is also sent. Gambling is also forbidden at the Settlement, and guilty persons are punished. 162 For the kokuas, the same rules are applied with some additional ones. Every able-bodied male kokua gives one day's labor to the Board per week, for which he enjoys all the privileges and benefits of the place. Kokuas deserting their leprous wives or husbands, on whose account they were permitted to live at the Settlement, are told to leave. Kokuas repeatedly guilty of disorderly conduct or gross immorality are likewise ordered to go. Every kokua can leave the Settlement when he pleases, but he cannot return without a special permit from the president of the Board of Health. Kokuas guilty of crimes or Sr)isdemeanors, are tried according to the laws of the Kingdom. 9. Livestock Animals at the settlement at that time consisted of 235 horses, 288 mares, and 74 colts; 40 cows, 18 steers, 25 heifers, IO oxen, 1 bull, and 25 calves; and 20 jackasses and 3 mules--a total of 739 animals roaming over the land. h. Recommendations A few suggestions were offered by Meyer to further improve the condition of the people. These were: to reinstate the system of giving the choice of receiving either food rations or cash in lieu thereof besides providing means to enable them to earn a little money, such as by raising crops for purchase; to obtain water for Kalaupapa from an unfailing source rather than from springs dependent on an uncertain rainy season; to erect a new slaughterhouse, the present one being old and difficult to keep clean, in a place where water can be supplied from the pipe system; and to send a large number of beef cattle to the settlement to fatten on the extensive pastures. 58 57.

Goto Treatment Around this time (1886) a new treatment for leprosy victims was being tried in the Kaka'ako Hospital based on the work of a Japanese doctor named Masanao Goto. The remedy appeared to have cured a large number of cases in Japan and was considered to be much more effective than the Hoang-Nan pills used earlier. Toward the end of 1885, Goto had been brought to Hawai'i by the Board of Health to work on contract at the branch hospital. His treatment consisted of taking two baths every day in hot water in which a certain quantity of Japanese herbs with medicinal qualities had been dissolved. After every meal the patient took a small pill, followed an hour later by an ounce of tea prepared from the bark of a Japanese tree. 59 Damien studied the remedy carefully and felt some optimism about its use. King Kalakaua and the doctors wished to introduce the treatment at Moloka'i. Furnished with a bathtub and hot-water heater, Damien himself tried the system for several weeks and declared that he was greatly helped. The Japanese treatment became very popular with the patients, especially the bathing part of it. They bathed in anything they could find, including tubs and water-tight boxes built out of old lumber. The process became such a mania that a necessity arose for a large bathhouse. Anxious to make the treatment available to all the patients, Damien drew up plans for such a building. On August 4, 1886, Damien submitted a plan for the board's consideration for construction of a hospital on the sloping plain directly east of his house. There patients could follow a treatment similar to that practiced at Kaka'ako Branch Hospital. The complex was to consist of a boiler room; two bathhouses, each divided into five bath rooms ; one dining room; one cook house; six dormitory buildings; and one small house for a manager with a dispensary compartment. The buildings were to have suitable verandahs and the whole area of about 300 by 400 feet was to be enclosed by a substantial fence. About 100 patients whose cases gave promise of success would be accommodated. 59.

These would be more advanced cases that might still benefit from Dr. Goto's treatment. 60 Despite earlier enthusiasm for the project on the part of the board, it is clear from a letter of December 8 from Damien to Gibson that the proposal was vetoed as being too expensive. Damien was requested to find a means of carrying out the treatment utilizing already existing buildings. This Father Damien determined to do, and by early in 1887, Brother Dutton and Father Damien had installed the \"Stone Valley bath house,\" 61 where Damien and a hundred other patients could follow the prescribed treatment. Damien proceeded to demonstrate his belief in the treatment by excessive use of both medicines and bathing, using extremely hot water and soaking for hours. After a few weeks grave symptoms appeared that showed the unsuitability of the treatment, at least for his case, although he refused at first to admit its failure. By June 1887 many of the people began to stop the treatments. Damien also reduced his participation in the process, but not 60. J. Damien De Veuster, Cath. priest, to Walter M.

A -- description of the bathhouse at Kalawao appeared in an 1897 newspaper: At a few yards outside the bath house, we were shown a deep hole in the solid rock. Over this hole was a platform three feet high, and supported at each corner by a square wooden leg. On the whole, it resembled a washboard, ribbed as it was by lengths of wood covered with tin. Between each rib was an open space of two inches. This was the cleansing board. The lepers are put upon this board and are washed with a solution of permanganate of potash.

The treatment remained in use for many years but was finally discontinued about 1896. It was not considered successful. It had not only failed to help Damien, but, added to his extra exertions to finish all his many projects before his death, may have hastened his demise. 62 4. Arrival of Brother Dutton a. Life of Ira Barnes Dutton The story of Ira Barnes Dutton is another extraordinary one connected with the Kalaupapa leprosy settlement and in its own way is as heroic and self-sacrificing as that of Father Damien. It is a story of self-imposed penitence by an ordinary man who felt he had sinned deeply and determined to atone for his wrongs. This he attempted to do by dedicating himself to the people of Kalawao and Kalaupapa for the last forty-five years of his life. In the course of this work he influenced the lives of hundreds of young men and commanded the respect of people in all walks of life all over the world. Dutton was born in the area of present-day Stowe, Vermont, on April 27, 1843. His father was a farmer and his mother taught school. In 1847 the family moved to Janesville, Wisconsin, where Dutton performed a variety of odd jobs. His mother taught him until the age of twelve, when he entered school. He went on to attend Milton College. Becoming interested in soldiering and military affairs, he became a member of the Janesville City Zouave Corps, the young men of which, at the onset of the Civil War, were enrolled as Company B of the 62. Another treatment used was gurjun oil, brought to the settlement from India by Edward Clifford, an Englishman and artist of sorts with an interest in leprosy who visited Kalawao in 1888. The brown, sticky oil was mixed with lime-water ,to make a soft ointment to be rubbed daily on the skin. The treatment was soon abandoned as a complete failure. Many other \"cures\" were tried, such as anti-leprol, a derivative of chaulmoogra oil. Chaulmoogra oil itself was then introduced and used for a long time in the treatment of leprosy in practically all parts of the world. I 0 166 Illustration 23.

Dutton was immediately appointed regimental quartermaster sergeant. After the war ended, he served for about two years as a quartermaster's agent on cemetery construction duty. This involved disinterring bodies from unmarked graves and reinterring them in new national cemeteries. In 1866 Dutton married a young lady with whom he was infatuated but who proved unfaithful and extravagant. She left him in 1867. Dutton's period of despondency began then and led to overindulgence in the use of liquor for several years thereafter until 1876. Dutton still managed to keep positions of responsibility. He worked for fourteen years in Memphis, Tennessee, from 1870 until the fall of 1884. For six of those years he worked for the Louisville and Nashville Railroad Company and for the other eight with the War Department as an Investigating Agent and U.S. Commissioner. Around 1874-75 Dutton vowed to abstain from whiskey and never drank again. He also decided to atone for his past degeneracy by embracing the Catholic faith. On his fortieth birthday, in 1883, he was received into the Catholic Church of St. Peter's in Memphis, where he took the name of one of his most admired biblical personnages--Saint Joseph. He vowed to devote the rest of his life to penance. He entered the Trappist Monastery at Gethsemane, Kentucky, in 1884, one of the most strict Catholic orders, espousing complete silence and hard work. Dutton remained there for about twenty months, but felt limited in his opportunities for humanitarian work. He also during that time determined never to accept any compensation for his work. Dutton began looking around for some environment allowing more flexibility and a broader scope of activities. He went to St. Louis in an attempt to learn more about various religious orders. While attending a conference in New Orleans during this time he first learned of Father Damien and his work in the pages of a Catholic publication. The article he read was evidently Charles Stoddard's piece \"The Martyrs of Molokai\" (later retitled \"The Lepers of Molokai\"), because from there Dutton journeyed to South Bend, 170 I L- b. Arrival on Moloka'i Further encouraged by Stoddard, Dutton sailed for Hawaii and arrived in Honolulu on July 22, 1886. There he immediately contacted Bishop Hermann Koeckemann and Walter Gibson, president of the Board of Health, and poured out his desire to go to Moloka'i. He was granted permission by Gibson and one week later, on July 29, 1886, the forty-three-year-old Dutton set foot on the Kalaupapa peninsula, his arrival unannounced : Father Damien was there waiting, with his buggy--low, wide, and rattling-- and a steady old horse. I introduced myself as coming with King Kalakaua's permission. . . . We climbed into to Kalawao. . . . Kalaupapa was a town of non-lepers then, and Father Damien had a church there, while he lived by the one at Kalawao, the leper settlement, where he had been for about thirteen years. He was now a leper in the advanced stage; he died nearly three years later. I was happy as we drove over that morning. The Father talked eagerly, telling how he had wanted Brothers here, but the mission had none to spare yet. So he called me Brother, as I had come to stay, and gave me at once the care of two churches. He was full of plans that morning, talking of wh& he wished for his lepers, the dreams he had always had. 0 Indiana, to talk further with Stoddard on the subject of the leprosy settlement. 0 Dr. Mouritz lunched that first day with Dutton and described his appearance: It was a hot dusty trip, yet Dutton showed no fatigue nor travel-stained clothes. He wore a blue denim suit, which fitted his tall, well-knit, slim, muscular figure. He stood about five 63. Dutton, Samaritans of Molokai, p. 198. Dutton never took any vows, but in 1892 was ad%itted to the Third Order of St. Francis. He wrote : \"I am not and never have been a Brother in the sense used by religious orders. I am just a common, everyday layman .'I Quoted 'I The Life of Brother Joseph 0 in Richard Halpern, ed., Brother Joseph Dutton, 1843-1931, A Saint for Vermont (Stowe, Vt.: -- Blessed Sacrament Church, 1981), p. 5, 171 feet seven inches tall, had dark brown hair and grayish blue eyes, a low voice, placid features, and a pleasant smile. He was reserved and thoughtful, had nothing to say about his past life or the reason for his seeking seclusion6$nd work at Molokai and turning his back forever on the world. Dutton himself said: I was firm in at least one resolve: to get along with everyone, to ask no special favors, not to make anyone the slightest difficulty that I could reasonably avoid, and to do what I could to help my neighbor in every way. It has always been my hope never to falter in this, and [I] may add . . . to my own busines . . . This was the resolution in my heart when I came here. From that time on, Dutton did not leave the colony until 1930, when he was taken to St. Francis Hospital in Honolulu. Indeed he did not even leave Kalawao from 1893 until 1930 when he went to Kalaupapa, two miles away, for eye surgery. C. Work Begins For the first few days, Dutton stayed in Damien's house beside the church, but before long he moved to a house of his own a few yards away. Because Damien knew his days were numbered, he had an endless string of projects he wanted to accomplish as quickly as possible. Medical work took up much of Dutton's time, cleaning and dressing sores, attending ulcers, and treating other skin troubles. Dr. Mouritz taught him the rudiments of medicine and surgery, dressing wounds, and properly applying bandages. This work consumed the major part of every day, for Damien ultimately turned all the medical and nursing duties over to him. In addition Dutton became carpenter', 64. Dutton, Samaritans of Molokai, pp. 198-99. - 65. - Ibid., p. 199. 172 stonemason, architect, gardener, druggist, nurse, and secretary. His other duties involved constantly finishing jobs that Damien had started, for the latter would drive ahead at what he thought was most important, until he thought something else was more important, when he would jump over into that. Thus he always left a trackof unfinished jobs, though a certain share would be completed. Brother Dutton always seemed able to attend to his many duties and still maintain a calm unruffled equanimity. Dignified and gentlemanly, neat and clean, he immediately commanded great respect from Father Damien, the Board of Health, and most importantly, the patients themselves. In addition to their differences in personality and work habits, Dutton and Damien also differed in their attention to the danger of infection. Dutton always washed and scrubbed his instruments, tools, and possessions that had been handled by the patients before he touched them. Dr. Mouritz enumerated some of Dutton's duties performed daily: Fr. Damien's companion, secretary, servant, nurse, and other menial work, sexton, sacristan, verger, purveyor for Fr. Damien's Homes and his household, hospital steward, dresser, clinical clerk, later manager of the Baldwin Home, sanitary engineer, architect, landscape gardener. . . . Br. Dutton was also postmaster. For years ay ingle-handed and alone, he filled well all of the above offices. Most of Brother Dutton's work, however, would eventually revolve around the Baldwin Home for Boys, an enlargement of Father Damien's Boys' 66. Ibid., p. 202.

The job was finished a year later. 3. St. Philomena Church a. Tabernacles On August 26, 1886, Father Damien of $35,000 to from Waikolu wrote to the Reverend Daniel E. Hudson requesting that he procure one or two new tabernacles of some light material or metal so as to prevent any insect getting into it, to be from fourteen to sixteen inches wide and deep, and two feet high, having on the top a place to expose the Blessed Sacrament. 68 The material Damien suggested was to be either iron or sheet nickel plated to prevent rusting. Damien also requested that, if there was enough money procured in the tabernacle collection through subscriptions by charitable donors, Father Hudson buy and send a few six-branched candlesticks to suspend in the nave. 69 68.

Hudson, Nov. 23rd, '86, Appendix 2, in ibid., pp. 407-408. Damien may finally have received the candlesticks, for a letter was found dated early 1888 regarding duties paid on seven cases of chandeliers and iron safes for the use of the Catholic Church. J .A. Hassinger, Chief Clerk, to Father Damien, Interior Department Letters, No. 35, Feb. 17, 1888-July 23, 1888, Hawaii State Archives, Honolulu. 174 By early summer 1888 the tabernacles had been received. In preparation for placing the tabernacle at Kalawao, Damien built a solid stone pillar three feet square and eight feet high, part of it under the church floor: We had some difficulty in lifting up the interior tabernacle on account of the heavy weight of the metal part (not far below 2000 pounds), the elaborated wood-work which incloses the safe, fits perfectly well over it, and the canopy, though a little too high for our rather low church--comes right up at a few inches below the ceiling, it has a true monumental appearance and if I succeed to make the new altar, just now commenced, to correspond with the loftiness of the tabernacle, we will have a I place to consecrate and preserve the blessed Because the new altar would take up quite a bit of room and because the number of Catholics was increasing, Damien was obliged to begin an addition to the church. b. Landscaping In the spring of 1887 Brother Joseph requested from Father Hudson some seeds and plants. \"Various alterations about the buildings and grounds of the mission has given opportunity for making effort to cultivate some flowers, grow some trees, etc. \" 71 Among the plants specified were a general assortment of vegetable seeds, catalpas, fucheia, hibiscus, lilies, and roses, most of which would be planted around the two churches of the mission. In addition to planting a few trees, shrubs, and flowers around the church, Brother Dutton painted the interior and built a neat fence around the structure. 72 The exterior 70. J. Damien to Rev. D.E.

Damien also built a large concrete bake-oven in the adjacent yard, near the cookshack for the childrens' homes. 73 C. New Addition A severe storm in 1888 blew down the steeple so carefully erected by Father Damien in 1876. Brother Joseph's first cabin stood behind the church. It was ten by fourteen feet, painted inside and whitewashed outside, and connected with the passageway to the church. 74 As Dutton recalled later, The storm came in the night and seemed about to take possession of the little cabin, which opened into the sacristy. . . . [The steeple then fell. ] I got the door open and went over to Father Damien's house. In the large room downstairs (that I was using as a drug room) Father Gregory [Gre'goire Archambaux], a leper, had a temporary bed. . . . After that, the steeple being down, Father Damien was going to at once make the nave some ten feet longer, putting a new steeple further along. . . . I persuaded Father Damien to wait a little while. The Irish stone mason had just then come. We hunted, and found some fairly good rock near the old crater. Then I labored with Father Damien--advocating a new church in rock. In about a month he agreed to this. It was built over the old transepts, these old parts being taken out later. This rock church (partly wood) is our church at present [1908], and the old nave is connected with it, as seen in the later ~ct~rd~~-the steeple . 73. Leo V.

According to Dutton's memoirs, Father Damien was intensely interested in the additions to the church: On one occasion he went to Honolulu to consult builders in order to find out how to strengthen the tops of the walls so that they would support the roof, and brought back with him a lot of two-inch planking with which to make a \"cap\" over the top of each wall. The rafters rested upon this cap. The two wings of the original church served as \"wings\" to the reconstruction edifice, and in these the Damien altar, and the benches which were used in his day, are preserved. A new and spleid altar occupies the sea end of the present building. Sister Vincentia mentioned that on Christmas Day 1888, the sisters were invited to dinner at Damien's house. Upon 75.

Case, Joseph Dutton, p. 91. 177 their reaching Kalawao, Damien showed them the new church, where he had been assisting the workmen in plastering the inside wall. 78 In the first part of 1889, Joseph Dutton wrote Father Hudson with another request: Rev. Father Damien directs me to request that you cause to be forwarded to him at once, by McShane & Co., Baltimore, a bell for our church, 400 or 500 Ibs., and that you can pay towards the expense the balance of the fund in your hands, notifying him of the amount yet to pay on the bill (and fixtures) and as to how he shall draw check to pay the same . . . from funds that he has on deposit with Bishop and Co., Bankers, Honolulu. . . . He is quite anxious to have the shipment made as quickly as possible for the reason that all the work on the church--save the completion of the tower--will soon be finished, and he desires to have the bell before completing the tower, so as to be sure that sufficient space be provided wherein to hang the bell. . . . The new church is quite imposing (for this place) and the new altar, all say, presents a really fine appearance. The old one is also retained, and both are used at the same time through the week, as Father C% rardy is now staying here a new house is being built for him. Damien died while the roof on the church was being completed, with Dutton superintending and residents doing the carpentry work. 0. Colony in 1888 1. Help for Damien Arrives Upon receiving word in 1888 that the Sisters of St. Francis were definitely coming to Kalaupapa to supervise the new home 78. Notes on Father Damien, from the original notes of Sr. Mary vincentia McCormack of the Franciscan Sisters, Appendix 2, in Jourdain, Heart of Father Damien, 1955, p. 422. -- 79. Joseph Dutton to Rev. D.E. Hudson, Jan'y 30, 1889, Appendix 2, in ibid., p. 414. 178 for leprous girls and women at Kalaupapa, Father Damien and Mr. Meyer chose a site for the sisters' new home on a little hill five minutes from the Catholic Church and not far from the wharf on the Kalaupapa side of the peninsula. Six days after the sisters' arrival, Father Wendelin Moellers, the new pastor of the Kalaupapa church, arrived. He would also serve as the sisters' chaplain. Mother Marianne was an extraordinary woman, with courage and compassion, who, like Damien, seemed to feel Moloka'i a divine mission. Since 1883 she had been superior at the Kaka'ako Branch Hospital in Honolulu. In 1886 she had been awarded the Order of Kapiolani by King Kalakaua, and from 1888 until her death in August 1918 she would serve as superior of the Bishop Home at Kalaupapa. From the very first Mother Marianne and her companions surrounded the declining old fighter, Father Damien, with kindness, affection, and veneration. Damien at this time, though failing, was rewarded by seeing that his labors would be continued after his death. Damien was being aided at Kalawao by Father Louis-Lambert Conrardy, a Belgian secular priest who had presided over a parish in Oregon among the Indians for fifteen years. Upon learning about Moloka'i in 1877, Conrardy would have gone to join Damien then except that he felt the Indians needed him. It was customary for all the personnel in a mission to be of the same religious order. When Father Conrardy asked Damien in 1888 to be allowed to come immediately, with the intention of later becoming a member of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts, Damien had no objections, although most of the other Hawai'ian missionaries did. Notwithstanding the opposition, 17 8o Father Conrardy arrived on Moloka'i May . 80. By 1889 Father Damien lived upstairs in his little house near the church, while Father Conrardy lived on the ground floor. They ate in separate rooms as a precaution against contagion. The two laymen, Brother Joseph Dutton and Brother James Sinnett, assisted in nursing, teaching, and visiting, while at Kalaupapa Father Wendelin and the sisters lived and worked. Edward Clifford, \"With Father Damien and the Lepers, 'I Eclectic Magazine [N.Y.] (June 1889), p. 810. James Sinnett, an Irish layman, had arrived at Kalawao in 1888 and worked for Dutton at the Boys' Home. 179 2. Charles R. Bishop Home The Bishop Home was named after its benefactor, Charles Reed Bishop, a wealthy Protestant Honolulu banker, capitalist, and philanthropist, and widower of Bernice Pauahi Bishop, last of the Kamehamehas. The buildings were completed by mid-September 1888 and became the property of the Hawai'ian government. Arrangements were then made to transfer the sisters there. 81 The old receiving station at the Kaka'ako Branch Hospital had been broken up and some of its materials were used in new houses at Kalaupapa and in construction of the Bishop Home. The home was run by the Franciscan Sisters of Charity though administered by the Board of Health. The sisters' convent at the Bishop Home was a neat little one-story house painted white with green blinds. A narrow corridor divided the building and a six-foot verandah ran the whole length of the house. Four small cottages were constructed for the women residents, two to be used as sleeping quarters, one for cooking and dining, and the last as a receiving station for surgical and medical work. 82 The sisters 81. L.A. Thurston [Minister of the Interior] to Chas. R. Bishop, Sept. 21 I 1888, Interior Department Letters, No. 36, July 23, 1888-Nov. 1, 1888, Hawaii State Archives, Honolulu, p. 245. 82. Jacks, Mother Marianne of Molokai, p. 74. A few more details on the Bishop Home complex are provided in Hanley and Bushnell, A Song g Pilqrimage and Exile, pp. 287-88: -- The Bishop Home for Unprotected Leper Girls and Women consisted of four cottages arranged in double file at one side of the sisters' convent. Sister Leopoldina described it in detail after she had lived in it for many years: \"The convent was a neat little one story house painted white [with] green blinds standing well back in a large field on the top of a little hill. a six foot veranda run the whole length of the house. a narrow hall went through the house. a large parlor, two sleeping rooms and a bath room open from the right side of the hall, from the left side a small reception room, two sleeping rooms , and a small storeroom[. j from the little reception room a door opened in to a neat little dining room. a door opened from the dining room on to a pleasant back veranda. at the end of this veranda was our poor little kitchen[. j 180 referred to the establishment as St. Elizabeth Convent rather than as the Bishop Home. The Catholic bishop provided money for building a chapel for the sisters. Between it and the convent was a room into which the patients could come to hear the celebration of Mass, but the residents were not allowed to enter the convent. The first few years at the home were difficult. There was a lack of fresh food, milk, and sufficient water. The sisters would take the women up into the valleys to a stream and wash their clothes on slabs of rock. Swarms of flies and rats infested the quarters where the sick were cared for. Gradually those problems were resolved, and the sisters' work at Kalaupapa became extremely successful. None of the sisters ever became infected -with the disease, due primarily to their attention to matters of hygiene and cleanliness. No food or drink partaken of by them came into contact with the patients and all their coo king and laundry work was performed by nonleprous servants. Damien was always careful to avoid interfering in their precautions and took great pains to avoid close contact with them himself lest he infect them. 3. Report to the Legislature of 1888 In June 1888 the settlement was visited by a special committee of seven people appointed to report on conditions at the settlement under legislative Resolution No. 19. A few items noted by the committee will be mentioned here because they are relevant to assessing the condition of the settlement in that year: 82. (Cont'd) in the kitchen was a little rusty stove with only two holes her name was Flora we had fun with her she made us cry she was such a smoker. at the opposite side of the parlor was a small room we were to use for a chaple [sicj . - \"There were four small cottages (built for our lepers) of wide rough boards and they were whitewashed one to serve as a kitchen and storeroom one for a dining room and the other two were to be their sleeping rooms. . . . 'I 181 a. Agriculture and Livestock The bowl of KauhakZ Crater was being cultivated by k?jkuas and patients, presumably because it was sheltered from the elements. There were then 708 horses in the settlement, some patients owning as many as 15. They were becoming a serious problem because they were using pasturage that could support beef cattle. The horses served two purposes--pleasure riding and as beasts of burden to retrieve the weekly rations of pa'i 'ai from Waikolu Valley, to bring goods from the - Kalawao store to Kalaupapa, and to carry wood back from the hills. The board had at this time forbidden bringing any more horses into the settlement. b. Buildings (1) Houses The committee visited several of the houses of the patients: The first house certain members of the Committee . . . went into was one of a long row of houses, some single and some double, recently erected by the Board of Health, running parallel with and facing the sea-shore at Kalaupapa some forty yards inland, and back to the wind. The house consisted of a parlor, bed-room, veranda and veranda-room and was well fitted up for a Hawaiian home. We saw some literary works in English on the parlor table. . . . This house and home evidently was one of the best class in the settlement. The next two houses we stopped at were part of the same row of new houses above referred to, along whose entire length by the way ran a pipe with faucets placed a few feet in front of each house. One of these houses contained only women, some single and others married, who had left their husbands behind. They were all new-comers. . . . we passed on to a house occupied by single young men only. They had no complaint to make but one, and that was that the new houses were not tight at eaves, and that patients were chilled on windy and rainy nights. . . . Going on, we came to a group of houses which evidently had stood many years, and here we found patients who were old residents. The houses were small and crowded. We asked why they crowded together so--why they did not move into some of the empty houses we 182 had seen along the way? They only laughedlg3and said, \"Oh, we are all friends, and want to stay together. (2) Service Facilities The committee reported that the present hospital was in very poor condition though a large, airy dormitory had just been added. The board was also considering building a public dining hall and kitchen where patients would be served meals instead of getting rations and doing their own cooking. One of the requests from the patients was that a second butcher shop be established at Kalaupapa where it would be closer to those residents. It was also suggested by the committee that the systematic planting of trees be inaugurated. In terms of food supply, the residents petitioned for a steamboat to bring the pali 'ai from - the other side of Moloka'i directly to the settlement and not to Waikolu where the whale boats deposited it at present, necessitating that Kalaupapa residents travel the entire breadth of the peninsula to get their food. C. Foreign Patients The only major discontent found by the committee was voiced by foreign patients, who, on the whole, were not satisfied with the settlement. The difficulty arose because of the different lifestyles foreigners were used to, including different types of food and housing. Although aware of this problem, the board felt there was a real danger in drawing distinctions between native and foreign patients in the matter of rations and dwellings. Inconveniences that foreigners now had to put up with at the settlement included no tea or coffee rations, commodities that were a necessity to foreigners but a luxury to native Hawai'ians. Because the board believed it unwise to draw any distinction between the rations of foreigners and natives, it was suggested that foreign citizens Hawaii (Kingdom) Legislature, Report of the Special Committee on the -- 183 should contribute to a common fund, which would be used to help out all foreigners at the settlement. 84 4. Report of the President of the Board of Health, 1888 a. Buildings Rudolph W. Meyer reported on the number of buildings: five churches (two Protestant, two Catholic, and one Mormon), two storehouses, two pa'J 'aJ receiving houses, one store, two dorms (boys and girls), twelve hospital buildings, one prison with two cells, one receiving home at Kalaupapa for newcomers, one physician's house, and two dispensaries (Kalawao and Kalaupapa). The rest of the buildings were patient cottages, many owned by the residents who built them themselves or with the help of friends. There were a total of 374 structures- - 216 owned. by the sick or their friends, 53 (including 40 cottages) owned by the Board of Health, and the five churches owned by church members. b. Livestock During this time the board decided to stock the peninsula's pastures with breeding cattle. Fences would be erected to paddock the land. Livestock included 85 cows, 54 heifers, 34 steers, 63 calves, 2 bulls, 32 pairs of working oxen, 258 horses, 326 mares, 89 colts, 5 mules, and 30 jackasses. C. Improvements Contemplated improvements included a new slaughterhouse in a more central position and the division of the settlement into paddocks. One area would be intended for planting, others for the separation of stock and its better management. Recently completed were a hospital and a large dorm for orphan boys (at Kalawao). 85 84. g&i., pp. 14-15. 85.

Death of Father Damien As mentioned previously, long before Damien was officially pronounced a victim of leprosy, he thought he had detected signs of the disease on his person, though some of that itching and burning was probably not connected with that illness. Damien had the lepromatous form of leprosy. The early symptoms were severe pains in his feet and sciatic nerves and some insensibility of limbs. As the disease progressed, he showed the general disfigurement of advanced leptromatous leprosy, including loss of eyebrows, enlargement of earlobes, and swelling of the face and hands. Eventually sores erupted on his hands and face. Around the end of February 1889, Damien's health began to grow worse, and he was beset by constant stomach pain, nausea, heartburn, vomiting, fits of coughing, violent diarrhea,, painful skin eruptions, and depression. Realizing the end was near, he drew up a will in which he bequeathed all personal possessions to the Church. Confined to bed, he lay on a pallet on the floor, rolled up in a blanket and shaking with fever. His fellow missionaries were in constant attendance. Brother James never left him and Father Conrardy and Brother Dutton attended to his needs. Mother Marianne also came from Kalaupapa to see him and the residents were always in and out. Indeed his children and flock were constantly on his mind to the end, as evidenced by a description of a visit to Damien by Sister Vincentia: He refused to see any of us. The Sisters begged our good Chaplain to carry to the sick Father our request to see him before his death. One day he gave his consent to see the Sisters as some of us had not received his blessing. How glad I was when the good Mother told me to get ready and come with her to see the sick Father. When we came to his house at Kalawao--it was a two story house-- we entered the room above. Reverend Father Conrardy and Brother James were waiting on the sick Father. - Reverend Father Conrardy led us into a small room and there on a bed lay the \"Leper Priest\" in prayer. As we approached, he raised his right hand in welcome to us. Oh! how sad it was to see that holy priest all covered with sores in the last stages of the disease, lying on that poor bed tossing to and fro with pain and fever. How cheerful he tried 185 to be, forgetting awhile his own suffering to thin k of others, to think of his leper boys. Not having received his blessing, I knelt by his bedside and begged him to bless me. The good priest raised up his right hand--it was all covered with sores--and blessed me. For a moment I pressed my face on the quilt that covered the bed of his last agony and wept bitterly, thinking and asking my own heart--\"Can you do as much as this for God?\"--and how I prayed that God would bless us all. I asked--\" Will you pray for us when you go to Heaven?\"--He answered : \"I will pray for you if I have any power in Heaven. 'I We then bid the good Father good-bye. We thought it would be the last time for then he was very weak and his breath was very short. The least exertion caused him trouble in breathing. He held the hand between little short respirations for his voice was gone--he had something else to say--he whispered: \"Will you-- see--to--my boys?\" His boys, his little flock of leper boys, he was leaving behind in Damien Home. Again he repeated the same words : \"Will YOU --see--to--my boys?\" We promised to see to the leper boys, with this prg ise the good Father was satisfied. And we kept our promise. With patience and resignation, Father Damien, Apostle of the Lepers, died in the arms of Brother James on April 15, 1889, just a few days before Easter. His body was clothed in his cassock in preparation for burial, and those present said that soon the blemishes of the disease disappeared from his face and the sores on his hands dried up. His body lay in state in St. Philomena until the next day, surrounded by tearful residents. On the day of burial, a Mass was said by Father Wendelin and a funeral procession headed by the cross then moved into the cemetery. First came the musicians and the confraternities, then the sisters and their charges from the Bishop Home, then the coffin borne by eight patients followed by Fathers Wendelin and Conrardy, the acolytes, and then by Brothers James and Dutton and the orphan boys and the rest of the population. Damien was buried, according to his wish, under the pandanus tree that first sheltered him on Moloka'i. There he remained for forty-seven years. The Catholic mission put a cross of black marble above his grave bearing the inscription: 86. Notes on Father Damien from the original notes of Sr. Mary Vincentia McCormack of the Franciscan Sisters, Appendix 2, in Jourdain, Heart of Father Damien, 1955, pp. 421-22. -- 186 V.C.J.S. Sacred to the Memory of the Revd. Father DAMIEN DE VEUSTER DIED A MARTYR TO THE CHARITY for the afflicted Lepers April 15, 1889 R.I.P. On September 11, 1893, a large cross of red granite, designed by Edward Clifford, was unveiled at the settlement, erected in his memory by the English people. Its site was chosen by King Kalakaua. On its lower part is a medallion of white marble with the head of Damien in high relief and the inscription \"Greater love hath no man than this that he should lay down his life for his friend. 'I Although it was most fitting and in accord with Damien's wish to be buried on Moloka'i among his flock, in 1936 King Leopold III of Belgium asked the Territory of Hawai'i to return the priest to his native country and requested help from President Franklin D. Roosevelt to bring the body back to Belgium. On January 27, 1936, the body was exhumed in front of dignitaries of Church and State. Patients chanted Ke Ola and -- Aloha 'e, the traditional ode of farewell, as the body was placed in a casket of koa wood, an honor reserved for royalty. The villagers looked upward with tears in their eyes as the coffin was flown to Honolulu where full official honors were paid to the remains and a solemn funeral Mass was celebrated in the cathedral. The highest dignitaries were present as well as numerous government, civil, and military officials, representatives of religious orders, and all classes of society. An American ship carried the casket to Panama and a Belgian ship then carried it on to Antwerp. In a triumphant return to his homeland, the humble missionary was greeted by the king, members of the government, religious officials, and an enormous crowd. Funeral services were conducted in the cathedral and later in the evening of May 3 an automobile carried the casket through Tremeloo to Louvain. Toward midnight Father Damien arrived at the place from which he had embarked seventy-three years before. His remains were finally laid to rest in a crypt of St. Joseph's Chapel. 187 In 1935 the territorial governor of Hawai'i signed a law setting up an annual gift of $3,000 to assure the preservation, as a national monument, of the church and graves of St. Philomena. 2. Leqacy of Father Damien So many years after his death, the glory and renown and the controversy and jealousy that surrounded Father Damien during his lifetime can be viewed from a better perspective. When Damien first arrived on Moloka'i, he found a still undeveloped leprosy settlement consisting of a few thatched grass huts, some wooden shacks, and a primitive hospital building. Upon his death, the peninsula held almost 400 buildings, including dormitories, neat cottages, a hospital complex, a prison, a store, a physician's residence, and storehouses. The water supply had been increased, food and clothing rations bettered in quantity and quality, and the beginnings of another formal community started at Kalaupapa. Whatever else may be said about him, it cannot be denied that much of this development was due in great part to Father Damien. The publicity surrounding his work on Moloka'i was a constant impetus for reform and improvement on the part of the Hawai'ian government, which unfailingly provided money and labor for new facilities and homes. Damien was relied upon by the Board of Health to help in the daily administration of the settlement. Superintendent Meyer's presence at the settlement was sporadic, and no resident physician was provided for several years; to the young Belgian parish priest, therefore, fell the tasks of running the hospital, the slaughterhouse, the landing, and other service facilities, simply because he was there. Damien was the first priest to remain at the settlement and live daily with the people. Because he showed no fear of their disease and treated them as friends, they trusted him. Physical contact among friends and family was important to the Hawai'ian leprosy victims, and as soon as Damien decided to physically touch them and to share possessions, he became one with them, as well as eventually one of them. And although he helped bring about many physical improvements, more importantly he gave the people spiritual aid and promised hope for a better future-- if not in this life, then in the next. He brought order, 188 peace, and spiritual comfort first, and then helped the kingdom address the temporal problems of adequate housing, better food, water, and medicine. In return he endured endless labor and untold physical suffering, but gained inner peace and tranquility. Damien's activities at the settlement were at all times subject to controversy. He was frequently accused by his superiors and government officials of vanity and showmanship; the vast amount of publicity his work generated was considered by many detractors to be due to his active efforts. Those who knew him best, however, were always impressed by his humility. The publicity was *often an embarrassment to him but tolerated because it showed to the world the difficulties his people were bravely enduring and encouraged donations of money and clothing and other charitable acts. He was said by his superiors to be hard to get along with, though the many distinguished visitors who came to Moloka'i found him generous, warm-hearted, and amiable and struck up enduring friendships with him. It was only in fighting for reforms and benefits for his flock that Damien could be stubborn, impatient, abrasive, and inflexible. As he became older and sicker, he probably became more obstinate and unyielding because of all he wanted to accomplish before he died. Damien was also alone most of the time, and, because he was not close to his fellow churchmen, either physically or temperamentally, he often resorted to doing things his own way on a daily need basis. Overwhelmed by all the improvements needed, he considered only the needs of his people, while the Catholic mission in Hawai'i had to consider the interests of the mission as a whole. In addition his superiors were wary of antagonizing the Hawai'ian government and its powerful Protestants, so they were often harsher on Damien than they might have been otherwise; it was difficult to extend him as much aid as possible while at the same time trying to moderate his actions and not offend the Board of Health. One of the primary criticisms of the Damien legend has been that his admirers have ignored the work of so many other pioneer missionaries or that their work at least has been viewed as incomparable 189 in scope or effect. This is true to some degree, for certainly other early missionaries in the islands, both Protestant and Catholic, sacrificed much in terms of personal comfort to bring the word of God to Hawai'i. It should be emphasized, however, that Damien stood apart from many of his fellow missionaries, both Catholic and Protestant, if not especially in terms of religious zeal, devotion, or virtue, at least in terms of exceptional personality and character traits and a wide variety of skills--manual labor, administration, medicine, public relations--that enabled him to accomplish far more with much less, but which often made his position within the strict Catholic Church organization very uncomfortable. He sought only to do good, although often with an indiscreet zeal that irritated his colleagues, and his activities in behalf of the sick were bonded with a passion for the cause of the Church and his congregation. To promote these two causes, he proceeded energetically, flattering no one, and fearless of the attacks of his adversaries. He existed in a world of tensions and contradictions, living with the hostility of fellow churchmen, the unending praise of the world press, and with an always tenuous dependency on the generosity of the Hawai'ian government. Coupled with his extraordinary character was his place in time, the peculiar set of circumstances that thrust him in the middle of a unique social and medical experiment that became widely observed, studied, and publicized. Damien's importance lay in attracting attention to the plight of leprosy victims, specifically in Hawai'i, but in a larger sense, around the world. What might have turned into a squalid, forgotten village of outcasts became instead a model leprosy colony with the aid of government and charitable funds and through individual tenacity. The work of Father Damien aroused a renewed sympathy, not only in Hawai'i but around the world, for sufferers from leprosy. As the years passed and communications between nations increased, it became clearer that the medical and social problems of a country should not be isolated from public view, but dealt with without shame, because they were a part of the common experience. This time period more or less marked the dividing line between ancient and modern treatment of leprosy. Shortly 190 0 before Damien reached Kalawao, the Norwegian scientist Gerhard Hansen had isolated the bacillus causing the disease, and together The work of the priest and the scientist showed the world that both Hansen's Disease and the \"disease\" of man's inhumanity to man could and should be cured. 87 Even his slow death from the ravages of leprosy served a purpose, for it reaffirmed what Hansen's discovery of the bacillus seemed to indicate--that the disease was contagious rather than hereditary. It also proved that leprosy was not contracted by first contracting syphilis, as some members of the medical profession and the public at large had believed. The work of Father Damien de Veuster on Moloka'i is considered one of the greatest examples of apostolic activity in history. The fact that the priest, who had voluntarily offered his services despite the health risks to help people of another race, had died of leprosy was tremedously horrific and moving to Damien's admirers. His death immediately made him a saintly figure to the remote Europeans who had followed his missionary activities so closely. Omer Englebert wrote that Whatever be its source, the renown of Damien has suffered no loss with the passage of time. . . . Before Damien, people pretended to forget that lepers were men. His example made men blush for their cruelty and bend again to their duty. From his day, lepers have ceased to be treated as pariahs; they are no longer driven from the helping hand extended to all other sufferers; and the human race no longer bears the shaqg of casting from its bosom the most wretched of its children. Damien entered the colony as an obscure parish priest and left it acclaimed as a hero and martyr. He made the name of that once notorious exile famous all over the world as an example of what governments, doctors, and clergy could do to better the situation of 87. Bruce 6. Westfall, \"Father Damien, the Martyr of Molokai,\" Paradise of the Pacific 75, no. 5 (May 1963): 11. -- 88. Hero of - Molokai, p. 360. 191 afflicted peoples by meeting both their spiritual and earthly needs. It must be remembered that Damien could not have accomplished the good he did without the continuing aid and support, both in terms of money and encouragement, of the kingdom and the Board of Health. They, too, were experiencing great difficulties in working out, on a trial-and-error basis, the best way to deal with an incredibly controversial and heart-rending social and medical problem that necessitated tactics that were contrary to the native Hawai'ian way of life. Add to the situation the sudden arrival of a fiery young priest who brooked no opposition to his demands, and the emergence of the model leprosarium of later years was indeed a small miracle. After his death, the question of sainthood for Damien was raised. Despite acknowledgement in the years after his death of his heroic and self-sacrificing ministry, his superiors debated over whether it exemplified exceptional As Gavan Daws astutely perceived: . . . Damien was an unusual man living in a turbulence of holiness. So he emerged as a troublemaker in the eyes of his immediate superiors, who knew him as a person, and as a hero in the eyes of the world, where he was known only for what he did: in any case an oddity, an eccentricity, an embarrassment, an exception to rules--an exceptional man, who remained at the same time perversely most ordinary in his personal ways, the ways of a peasant born and bred. This interplay of the ordinary and the extraordinary was given dimensions of moral tragedy and grandeur by his leprosy, forcing all those who knew him or heard about him, once the world got hold of his story, to ponder the problem of sanctity as Damien's life posed it--whether there might be any such being as Robert Louis Stevenson asserted : a man with his own idiosyncrasies and personal defects, with all the grime but none the less a hero and a saint. 8gd paltriness of mankind, The importance and value of his work to the Roman Catholic Church was proven by the exhumation of Damien's remains and their removal in 1936 to a national shrine in his homeland. In 1938 89. Daws, Holy Man, p. 249. 192 beatification proceedings were finally begun. The process moved slowly, however, and not until 1969, after fourteen years of research and study, did the Roman Catholic Church initiate the first major step toward the canonization of Joseph de Veuster as Saint Damien. On July 7, 1977, Father Damien was declared Venerable and his virtues \"heroic,\" the last step before beatification. Father Damien is one of two persons selected by the state of Hawai'i to be represented in the National Statuary Hall of the United States Capitol (the other is Kamehameha I, unifier of the Hawai' ian Islands). Though Damien's physical presence has been removed from the peninsula, he remains a strong presence in the minds of residents and visitors alike. The most obvious reminders of him are St. Philomena Church and his tombstone in the adjoining cemetery, the @ hala tree long since decayed and cleared away. Also at the settlement is the English monument designed by Clifford and elsewhere on the island are churches he built for Catholics \"topside\" on Moloka'i. The greatest monument of all is the modern leprosarium that developed f n the crowded, unhealthy, and lawless little settlement he first found at Kalawao. 3. Visit of Robert Louis Stevenson One of the reasons Father Damien's story has become so well known is because of a letter defending him and his ministry written in response to a letter that appeared in the press after Damien's death critical of the priest and his accomplishments. The bitter letter of denunciation was written by Charles McEwen Hyde, a Protestant clergyman. The letter of defense was written by the famous British writer Robert Louis Stevenson and became a classic document in English literature as one of the most spirited and furious attacks in any language. Stevenson visited the settlement just after Damien's death. A search for health had led him to cruise with his family among the warm islands of the South Pacific in a chartered yacht. He arrived in Hawai'i in 1889, and for five months he traveled, wrote, and learned to know the 193 people of the islands, including the royal family. A few items noted by Stevenson are mentioned here for general descriptive interest: a. Pali Trails In describing the three valleys set into the face of the pali (Waih;?nau, Wai'ale'ia, and Waikolu), Stevenson mentioned that though from a distance they appeared to be verdant niches, in reality their rock faces were so steep that only in Waihsnau Valley was there a usable path. It was often destroyed by rains, however, and had to be continually maintained. It could not be ridden up and was a very exhausting climb and descent even for strong men. Stevenson wrote that the existence of another path to the west was mentioned by some residents. (According to a 1948 article on the settlement, in 1898 the right shoulder of the Waih;?nau Valley mouth was used as a trail, but by the 194Os, erosion, landslides, and disuse had obliterated it. Wai'ale'ia was said to be impassable; Waikolu could be climbed, but with difficulty. 90 b. Landing Places Because Kalaupapa was more sheltered, it was the customary landing place for boats. When entrance there was impossible, ships passed farther east to the vicinity of the two small islets near Kalawao and landed passengers with extreme difficulty and danger on a spur of rock. C. Kalawao The official quarters there consisted of the hospital enclosure and prison --a green area within a stockade with a few papayas and a flowering oleander, surrounded on three sides by low white houses. A little way off, enclosed in walls and hedges, stood the guesthouse of 90. \"Kalaupapa Settlement,\" rev. ed. May 15, 1948, V. A.9, M-420 (Judd Collection), p. 2. This earlier trail along Waih%au ridge was considered to have been a better trail than the present Kala'e (pali) trail further westward on the cliff face. It was used by Father Damien to go \"topside. 'I 194 0 Kalawao, and beyond that, the doctor's quarters. The guesthouse was utilized for visits by members of the Board of Health. 91 0. Board of Health inspection Visit, 1890 In March 1890 the president of the Board of Health and some associates made another inspection visit to the settlement. In their report they mentioned several items of interest in regard to buildings: 1. Bishop Home Within this complex, a schoolhouse with a large assembly room was being built. 2. Kalawao Father Damien's cottage was noted as being on the opposite side of the church from his grave. The church, cottage, and grave were al I enclosed by a fence, the front portion of which was bounded by the government road. The other three sides of the fence faced the group of old buildings constituting the Boys' Home. It was planned to place the three Catholic sisters in the neat cottage then being built on the opposite side of the road from the church. Though still living at Kalaupapa, the sisters had been in charge of the Boys' Home for about the last two months. The site of the Boys' Home was termed unfortunate--on the old graveyard below the road and subject to flooding. All the buildings were old except for the kitchen and dining room. The infirmary at Kalawao was under the direction of Dr. Sidney Bourne Swift, aided by Brother Du tton . The inspectors visited the slaughterhouse, which they termed a model of perfection. The floor of the slaughter room was concrete, and drain pipes conveyed the blood to the pig corral where offal also was thrown. A cattle pen adjoined the slaughter room. The cattle killed were furnished on contract by Sam Parker from his ranch on 91 . Robert Louis Stevenson, Travels in Hawaii, ed. by A.

Pali Trail The officials mention ascending the pali by a new \"road\" built the previous October. 92 R. Biennial Report of Board of Health, 1890 1. Buildinqs This report stated that several of the large buildings at Kaka'ako Branch Hospital, which had been established in 1881 for the treatment of leprosy, had been taken down and removed to the leprosy settlement where they were re-erected. The president of the board, during his visit to the settlement in 1890, noted many new buildings: at Bishop Home, three large dormitories, a school, and a recreation hall; at the Boys' Home an infirmary, dormitory, and dining room and stone cookhouse with a concrete floor; a hospital building of two wards; a new slaughterhouse with concrete floor and a cattle pen; an attached cookhouse and servant's cottage for the sisters in charge of the Boys' Home; a dining room for the sisters' chaplain at Bishop Home; a dispensary at Kalaupapa; an oil and soap storeroom at Kalaupapa; and a superintendent's house with office and outbuildings. The board president also noted that the first resident superintendent had arrived on January 1, 1890. 92. \"The Molokai Trip,\" Hawaiian Gazette, March 25, 1890 [from Bulletin of March 181, Father Damien Clippings 1890, MS Grp. 165.4, Bishop Museum, Honolulu. 202 2. Proposed Improvements Proposed improvements at the settlement involved : 1) reducing expenses and improving conditions by forming the residents into communities with a central cookhouse and dining room and feeding them in common; 2) concentrating people at Kalaupapa where there was more room, a better climate, and they would be closer to the landing. The Kalawao buildings, as they decayed, would be abandoned; and 3) erecting a visitors' house at the Kalaupapa landing to accommodate twenty people, where friends and relatives could visit under certain restrictions. 3. Sidney Swift Report The physician of the settlement, Dr. Sidney Swift, commented in the 1890 report on the unhealthy climate at Kalawao due to the extreme changes in temperature --from excessive heat to chill--due to being in the shadow of the cliffs, and on the unhealthy proximity of the old abandoned graveyard. Drainage of that area was necessary because during wet weather the rain filled the old graveyard depressions and created harmful \"vapors. I' 4. R.W. Meyer Report R.W. Meyer reported that there were six churches on the peninsula --a Protestant, Catholic, and Mormon one at both settlements. Meyer also stated that the idea of the Home for Boys originated with former Superintendent W. P. Ragsdale, but was carried to completion after Ragsdale's death by Damien. Meyer described the Baldwin and Bishop homes as composed of about twenty-four buildings. The Kalawao hospital comprised ten buildings. Meyer also mentioned two dispensaries, one at Kalawao and one at Kalaupapa; a resident superintendent's house (at Kalaupapa?); and a doctor's residence, a store, three storehouses for provisions, two @ houses, two prisons, and a boat house at Kalaupapa. 203 Illustration 27. Superintendent's residence on Staff Row, Building No. 5, 1983. Although a house was built for the superintendent in 1890 in this area, and this has been referred to as that structure, it does not appear to date from that early a period. It has, however, undergone several alterations. NPS photo. I I lustration 28. Superintendent's office on the corner of Staff Row and Beretania streets, 1930s. Courtesy Kalaupapa Historical Society, Kalaupapa. 204 It is difficult to tell if the doctor's residence mentioned is the one at Kalawao or possibly what later became the assistant resident physician's house on Staff Row. Improvements by 1890, in more detail, included: a. Bishop Home Twelve new buildings had been added to the original complex. The largest was a hall intended for recreation and for use as a school and sewing room. It could be made into one room if required. Also added were four new dorms, a cookhouse for the sisters, a servant's house, a carriage shed, and bathrooms. The original cooking and eating houses had been enlarged, a \"dead house\" added, and fencing erected around the premises. b. Boys' Home at Kalawao One large and one small dorm had been added, as well as a new stone cookhouse with a bake oven, an eating house, a washhouse for the use of the nurse washing sores, and a cottage for Brother Dutton. A cottage for the nurse had been added, and another for the Sisters of St. Francis--considered the handsomest building in the settlement--had been built by Benjamin Reed. C. Hospital A large new ward, a \"dead house,\" and a new fence surrounding the yard had been added to the hospital. Other improvements consisted of the new dispensary at Kalaupapa, a new prison surrounded by a fence (the old stone church), and the large cottage for the resident superintendent enclosed by a high board fence. A new graveyard had been fenced in that had been used for more than a year, the graveyard at Kalaupapa had been enclosed with 206 a stone wall, and new cottages had been built for the chaplain of the Sisters of St. Francis and for the Protestant pastor. 93 S. Colony in 1891-1892 I. Cultivation of Waikolu Valley During 1891 pressure was put on the Board of Health allow further cultivation and settlement in Waikolu Valley. In the fall that year, R. W. Meyer notified William H. Tell, new superintendent to of of the settlement, that the Board of Health wanted to provide suitable and remunerative labor for all able-bodied residents at the settlement and would allow them to cultivate taro in Waikolu Valley (to be known as the Waikolu Taro Plantation) under certain conditions. The reasons given by the board for granting only limited privileges to those people wanting to farm in the valley were-- 1. that the valley was several miles into the mountains and covered with many K'i plants - from which an alcoholic beverage o'kolehao was distilled; 2. that if the land was opened to all, both patients and kakuas would want to live there and probably run illicit stills; 3. that the patients and kakuas living in the valley could not be controlled as easily as those in more open settlements; 4. that settlement there might contaminate the water supply; 93.

Kuleanas (Private Homesteads) According to David Dayton, in early October 1891 there were seventeen kuleanas at the settlement, totalling sixty-six acres of land, that were still owned by private individuals. The board renewed pressure to acquire the lands, by condemnation if need be, because it felt that the entire segregation process was being aborted by outsiders coming onto the peninsula and staying on the private homesteads. g5 It had always been considered necessary to cut off illicit mingling with the residents for the preservation of discipline and for better management. 3. Miscellaneous Information on Buildings In the spring of 1892, C. N. Spencer, the minister of the interior, wrote the president of the Board of Health with the following suggestions, made as a result of his recent visit to the settlement: 1. that the wall between Kalaupapa and Kalawao be rebuilt (possibly the stone wall that currently parallels the Kalaupapa to Kalawao road on its south side); 2. that bathtubs be placed in the new bathhouse and water let in as soon as possible at the Boys' Home at Kalawao; 94.

Biennial Report of the President of the Board of Health, 1892 Improvements and repairs during the past months had included, at Kalaupapa: rearrangement of wards; erection of a *large hall (Beretania), two new wards, an eating house, a cook house, and a wash house; dismantling of the old Kaka'ako buildings; and erection of a new visitors' house near the superintendent's residence, a new schoolhouse, and a milking pen. At Kalawao a bathhouse at the Boys' Home and a new office adjoining the doctor's residence were constructed, and repair work was done on the former superintendent's house at Kalawao in the vicinity of the doctor's house. The board noted that the bulk of the population was now at Kalaupapa. 97 T. Report of the President of the Board of Health, 1894 1.

A hospital building was erected at his request at Kalawao, in addition to dorms, a bathhouse, a kitchen, and a dining room for forty patients. Goto had 140 patients under his care at the hospital and the Bishop Home, including outside patients with their own facilities for heating water. The hospital was equipped and patients admitted in May 1893. 2. Water Supply The board intended to construct a water reservoir on the high ground between Kalawao and Kalaupapa to insure a plentiful supply of water. The main pipe along the cliff near the sea between Waikolu and Kalawao was still exposed to waves during heavy storms and susceptible to damage from falling rocks. 3. Planting During the previous winter, the board had planted a large number of ironwood and eucalyptus seeds, and it hoped to continue the practice. After rows of those hardy trees matured, other more fragile trees and fruit trees could be grown within the shelter of those groves. 4. Government Buildings A list of buildings at the settlement owned by the board included, at Kalauapapa, the superintendent's residence, the visitors' house, the superintendent's office, the house of the chaplain to the Sisters of St. Francis, the house for the Protestant pastor, and Beretania Hall; at Kalawao, the resident physician's house and office, a visitors' house, and the house occupied by Dr. Goto. The Bishop Home was composed of the sisters' dwelling house, wards or dorms, a hall for recreation and school, a servant's house, an office, cookhouse, eating house, wash house, and a bath and other outbuildings. The Boys' Home consisted of a dwelling house, dorms or wards (five old, eleven new), a recreation hall, a servant's house, an office, and various outbuildings. 212 Total buildings at the settlement were 531, of which 151 were residences. 5. Schools Kalaupapa had both an old and a new school. 6. Hospital at Kalawao The complex at Kalawao included the steward's house, dorms or wards, a cookhouse, and other outbuildings. 7. Stores and Warehouses These structures included a new Board of Health store and a cottage for the storekeeper at Kalaupapa, the old store at Kalawao that was no longer used, two provision storehouses, two oil, soap, and salt storehouses, one storehouse for salted hides, one boathouse, and a slaughterhouse. 8. Workshops Workshops included a carpenter shop, blacksmith shop, and two dispensaries. 9. Improvements and Repairs Improvements and repairs had involved an addition to the Bishop Home of two new hospital wards, a bathhouse with a heating apparatus used in connection with the Japanese bath treatment, a second butcher shop at Kalaupapa to lessen the distance to the meat supply for its residents, a new store near the landing at Kalaupapa, a new chief storekeeper's cottage, the new home for boys and helpless men at Kalawao, and the new hall or reading room built from donations of the English people and named in honor of its donors \"Beretania Hall\" (a corruption of \"Britannia\"). IO. Kama'a'inas The kama'binas at Kalaupapa were still living on their kuleanas in 1894, but the government was slowly removing them. The 213 I I lustrations 31-32.

Owners were given the choice of either receiving the value of their kuleana in cash or purchasing lands elsewhere. 98 U. Baldwin Home 1. Construction Father Damien's home for boys at Kalawao had always been one of the most important facilities at the settlement and a project very dear to his heart. After Brother Dutton's arrival, most of the work of the home fell to him, which consisted of providing leadership and discipline, medical treatment, and food and clothing. From early 1886 to 1888, the Boys' Home had consisted of a cluster of small rude huts and cabins near Damien's house. In 1888 two large buildings were erected and many of the most dilapidated cabins were destroyed as their occupants were moved to the new structures. On January 1, 1889, the Damien Home was accepted as an official reality by the Board of Health and operated as a home under the management of Father Damien. After Damien's death, the Board of Health placed Mother Marianne in charge of the home, and provided a horse and carriage for the sisters to use in traveling between kalaupapa and Kalawao. On May 22, 1889, Sisters Crescentia and Irene arrived at Kalaupapa from Kaka'ako to help at the Boys' Home. While the sisters generally supervised the domestic operations, such as sewing and housekeeping, Dutton was expected to be disciplinarian and leader; he, however, concentrated mostly on keeping the accounts, attending to correspondence and general business affairs, handling the sore dressing, and attending the sick at the home and in the Kalawao hospital. By late spring 1890, the first official Home for Boys at Kalawao was completed. On May 15, Sister 98.

The kama'aina problem is further discussed in V, 2. 216 Crescentia (Directress), Sister Renata, and Sister Vincent moved into the new Convent of Our Lady of Mercy at Kalawao and assumed charge of the home. This convent stood across the street from St. Philomena and from the cluster of houses next to the church in which the boys lived, and was to be used during the day when the sisters wanted privacy. They still returned to Kalaupapa at night. In 1892 funds were given to the board by Henry P. Baldwin, Protestant sugar planter, financier, and philanthropist of Hawai'ian missionary stock, for the erection of four separate buildings to comprise the Baldwin Home for Leprous Boys and Men at Kalawao. Its purpose, decided upon in discussions among William 0. Smith, president of the Board of Health, Brother Dutton, and Baldwin, was to assist the men of the colony, make them comfortable, provide some recreation, and generally help them make the most out of their lives. The new home was occupied during the first week of May 1894. The complex consisted of twenty-nine separate structures, most new, but some moved across the street from the grounds of St. Philomena. Because of the disciplinary problems involved in running a home full of active boys, it was decided that a group of strong Christian men should be put in charge. On December 1, 1895, the Catholic sisters were relieved of duty at the home by the arrival of four Sacred Hearts brothers, who were placed under the direction of Brother Dutton in order not to antagonize the Protestants at the settlement. 99 Brother Dutton described how the home for boys developed : It was, when I first came, just a little cluster of shanties and cabins scattered around his house. In 1886 Father Damien 99. Case, Joseph Dutton, pp. 118-19. See Illustration 2024. According to Joseph Dutton, \"that good sized white house was the one used by Father Damien as a Girls' Home, under the care of Julia, a native woman-. The Brothers' [of the Sacred Hearts] house stands there now, first built for the Franciscan Sisters, and \"Baldwin Home\" covers the ground this side and back of that location.

Courtesy Hawaii State Archives, Honolulu. had some twenty or thirty of the lepers living near his house; in 1887 we had sixty, in 1904 there were a hundred and twenty. The cluster of little cabins did not answer the purpose very long. In 1887 it began to spread, and we built two houses of considerable size. This enlargement was sufficient as to capacity up to 1890--in fact, we had to do with it until May, 1894. But it was somewhat patchwork and not suitable for complete operation. Therefore, in 1890, we began to discuss a new and better home. In 1890-l-Z (along there) starts were made for our new home, but for one reason or another little progress was made. I was quiet at my work, not wishing any change; but Mr. W. 0. Smith, then president of the Board of Health, took a notion in his head in 1893 to get me to take hold of the construction of the home, as Mr. Baldwin would supply the means. I told him I could carry it out if left entirely in my hands and not bothered, and so it was. Neither the Board of Health nor anyone else asked anything about the plans. I called for anything and everything that was needed; no one made any suggestions or asked any questions. The home was occupied in May, 1894. Soon after, the Board of Health came to see it. Everyone was astonished to see the old rock-pile turned into what it was. There was so much I was almost ashamed, having come here to be a The home cost around $6,000. Baldwin contributed the initial outlay of money for construction, while the Board of Health, which later maintained the home, assisted in a number of ways. Mr. Baldwin continued to give generously to improvements for the home until his death in 1911, at which time his family took over that responsibility. Baldwin's financial generosity, coupled with the planning and unceasing labor of the Sisters of St. Francis, the Sacred Hearts brothers, and Brother Dutton, created a model institution. The site of the home had formerly been a treeless barren rocky area covered with rubbish. Brother Dutton and some of the patients removed the rocks and debris to make room for the new 100.

While the institution was primarily for the housing and care of boys, regulations were passed later by the Board of Health which permitted the entrance, when room was available, of older patients who desired to live there, although only males were allowed. The Baldwin Home was to be a retreat at all times open to leprous boys and to men who, through the progress of the disease or some other cause, had become helpless. It was not to be used as a free boarding house for those wanting to shirk their work obligations. All boys arriving at the settlement under the age of eighteen, unless in the care of their parents or guardians or near relatives who would watch over them, were to enter the home until reaching eighteen, when they could leave with permission of the superintendent. The inmates were given clothing, food, care, and medical attention, and in return were expected to work about the establishment. (Similar regulations governed the Bishop Home.)\"' 2. Description The new complex was visited during a semi-annual inspection of the settlement in May 1896. At that time the Baldwin Home was described as an enclosure of about 2% acres, rectangular in shape. On three sides were the dormitories, schoolhouse, laboratories, and bathrooms. On the fourth (north) side was the residence of the brothers. One of the brothers ran a tailor shop, one cooked for the brothers' mess, and two more attended to the housekeeping and dining room. The brothers also provided medical care. All the buildings were well separated as a protection against fire. The center of the enclosure, was a well-kept closely-cut green lawn whose centerpiece was a rock garden with a fountain of water. 102 By 1899 one of the chief features of 101. \"Baldwin Home--Regulations\" and \"Bishop Home--Regulations,\" file 1893, Rules & Regulations for Lepers & Kokuas at Leper Settlement, Hansen's Disease Records, Hawaii State Archives, Honolulu. 102. \"The Semi-Annual Inspection of the Leper Settlement (from Evening Bulletin, May 25, 1896), (1896): 109.

Kalawao was the garden attached to the home--a banana plantation with several acres of vegetables. 103 Vegetation at the home became quite lush through the years. In his memoirs, Dutton described bushy masses of countless Croton plants --actually small trees --back of the garden and all around the sides. The variegated foliage gave the home the appearance of being set in a big, red bouquet. 104 In addition to being ornamental, the trees provided fuel after they had aged a few years. Whenever a Kona wind blew in, the plants were cut down close to the ground to prevent their being uprooted. They would grow out again quickly and flourished among the stones in areas not yet fully cleared and graded. The garden had a little ash house and a big date palm near the center. Within a circle of red trees were about 2,000 banana trees. The rocks taken off the surface of the garden area were buried in long trenches. Buildings in the complex by the early 1930s numbered about fifty-five, including small structures such as the ash and oil houses. The brothers' house (formerly lived in by the Catholic sisters) was the best constructed, with a fine yard in front, on the road nearly opposite the singing house (fashioned from Damien's old two-story house). At the edge of the garden was the recreation hall, sixty by thirty-four feet with a verandah, containing a school room and band room. Dormitories, each twenty by thirty-six feet, were to the right and left of the hall. On the west side of the yard were six more dorms. The mattress house was behind this row. In the corner near the garden was a little cottage on a terrace where a white leprosy victim lived. Beyond the mattress house was a large shed for lumber, connected with the tool 103. \"A Trip to Molokai,\" Damien Institute Monthly Magazine 5, no. 3 (March 1899): 47. 104.

Dutton had it moved across the road and into the home complex. In the dormitories the smaller boys were at the lower end on the right side in front of the tailor shop. Advancing up the hill, the residents increased in age and size to the recreation hall. On the other side were full grown men, gradually increasing in age so that the two lower dormitories housed the old and helpless. From there they were moved to the house for the dead, near the church, just below the singing house. Below the two dorms for old and helpless patients was the office, containing the stock of drugs and a storage room for drugs, surplus small materials, and tools, opening into the shoe shop, saddle room, and Dutton's bathroom. The bathhouse and sore dressing rooms connected with the office by ten-foot-wide verandahs. The verandahs, with long benches lining the sides, were used for playing games and musical instruments and for perusing magazines and books. In front of the office was the machinery depar.tment. An open way of about fifty feet stretched from the front of the office down to the front gate, opposite the church, with the machinery buildings ranged along both its sides. Under one roof were the poi house, boiler house, beef room, pantry, and banana room. Nearby were a dining room, kitchen, woodshed and coal room, a lime and cement room, and a slop house. The storage house, for provisions and housekeeping articles, fronted on the road. The Bishop and Baldwin homes were both under the general control of the Board of Health in Honolulu, whose officials attended to the business matters. Mother Marianne was in charge of the Baldwin Home until 1895, at which time Brother Dutton became director, and with the aid of the Picpus brothers who arrived that year, the home continued to run smoothly for thirty-six years. 234 Illustration 39. Baldwin Home, no date, ca. 1900. Courtesy St. Louis-Chaminade Education Center, Honolulu. 236 By the time the home was finished, the general movement of people toward Kalaupapa had already begun. This was a slow process, actually beginning in the 1880s. According to Dutton, it was not until 1902 that all the patients at Kalawao, except for those in the Baldwin Home, had moved to the other side of the peninsula. As originally built and expanded upon, the home consisted of forty-five buildings, mostly dormitories. Some were torn down through the years and others erected. Dutton did much landscaping, involving laying out lawns, building stone walls, and planting trees and shrubs. At the rear of the home and along the base of the cliff, alongside the garden wire fence, was a row of coconut trees extending all along the east side, back of the dorms and tailor shop. These thirty or so trees came from Samoa. Forty-five Japanese plum trees, about fifty eucalyptus trees, about fifty alligator pear (avocado) trees, a dozen or more date palms, and many hibiscus and pomegranates were also planted. In the very center of the playground was a large hala tree, with three- to six-foot-long drooping leaves. With the help of the Sacred Hearts brothers, Dutton put in a modern sewer system to replace the unsanitary cesspools. The Baldwin Home continued in use at Kalawao until 1932, by which time all the functions of the settlement had been transferred to Kalaupapa and the Kalawao home was abandoned. The remaining buildings were burned in 1936. The new Baldwin Home will be discussed in a later chapter. 105 3. Remaining Years of Brother Dutton Dutton's management of the Baldwin Home involved a variety of responsibilites. He oversaw routine matters, dealt with disciplinary problems, beautified the grounds, and saw that proper recreation and amusement were provided for his charges. Public interest 105.

Courtesy Kalaupapa Historical Society, Kalaupapa. 244 in the Kalawao settlement remained strong even after Damien's death. Donations and gifts continued to arrive, providing the home with all sorts of games, a band, and a reading and amusement room where all books and magazines donated or subscribed to were rigidly censored by the stern Brother Dutton before being made available. As the Catholic brothers took over more of the duties of running the home, Dutton spent more time in correspondence, which helped keep the home in the public consciousness, although he never discussed its business in his letters. His address book contained more than 4,000 names in all parts of the world; bags of mail delivered to him sometimes weighed as much as fifty pounds. Because of the communications he kept up and the friendships made, tributes were often paid him. In 1908 President Theodore Roosevelt ordered the U.S. Atlantic Fleet (Great White Fleet), cruising around the world, to deploy off the island of Moloka'i to salute the former soldier in a gesture of goodwill for his devotion to the leprosy residents. Dutton had asked that the fleet appear so the patients could view it and feel pride in their country. Always very patriotic, Dutton, at the age of 76, volunteered to go to the front when the United States entered World War I. To interest the residents in the world outside, Dutton encouraged them to contribute to worthy wartime causes, such as the Red Cross (to which they subscribed nearly $6,000), Japanese relief, Near East relief, and the Starving Children of Europe. 106 They also purchased nearly $3,000 in War Savings Stamps. Dutton was a member of the Grand Army of the Republic, the Union Civil War veterans' association, and each year GAR members at their annual encampment voted to send Dutton a silk flag. To further instill a sense of patriotism in the patients, Dutton erected a flagpole in front of the office of the Baldwin Home. Raising and lowering the flags sent by the GAR became part of the home's daily routine. In 1925 the United States Pacific Fleet 106. Skinsnes, \"A Self-Imposed Exile,\" p. 8. 246 sailed in review before Kalawao while Dutton stood at attention next to the flag. Other honors included the naming of a school in Beloit, Wisconsin, after him; a Papal blessing in 1929; and a testimonial from the Hawai'ian legislature. After his arrival in 1886, Dutton never left the settlement. In the spring of 1930 he went to Kalaupapa for an eye operation, and in June, at age 87, an eye affliction and general poor health made it necessary for him to be hospitalized in Honolulu. He died on March 26, 1931, and was interred near Damien's grave at Kalawao. Dutton's life was a source of inspiration for those who worked with him and followed him. This humble, devout, diversely skilled, and educated individual was the right person in the right place at the right time. A loyal friend and ideal helpmate for Damien, his low-key, courteous manner helped moderate the Father's sometimes hasty temper and impatient personality. Dutton's skillful administration of the Baldwin Home, and the Catholic brothers' untiring physical efforts, resulted in many improvements, not only structural, but in the general morale and outlook on life of the patients. V. Move to Kalaupapa and Purchase of Remaining Kuleanas, 1894 1. Gradual Move to Kalaupapa The two villages of Kalaupapa and Kalawao had existed before the establishment of the leprosy colony. After 1866 Kalaupapa was inhabited by earlier residents and kckuas and was closed to leprosy victims. Early on, however, the sick began drifting over to the west where it was warmer and nearer to freight and passenger debarkation. Some of these people worked at the landing, where there was a freight warehouse and a small wharf at which boats from the inter-island steamer could land. The lack of water kept the population low, however. The distance between the settlements was so slight that the narrow Father Damien road or the longer trail around the seacoast were frequently traveled. After water pipes were extended to Kalaupapa, more people moved there. This movement from Kalawao to Kalaupapa had been ongoing since the 188Os, and by the early 1900s Kalaupapa was the center of activity and settlement. As new accommodations were erected at Kalaupapa, the old houses and service buildings at Kalawao were 247 1 destroyed. Only the Baldwin Home would remain in use as a residence at Kalawao, until the rehabilitation of Kalaupapa settlement in the 1930s and 0 the death of Brother Dutton prompted the removal of its function to the western side of the peninsula. 2. Condemnation of Remaining Private Homesteads On January 18, 1894, a commission was appointed by the Minister of the Interior to appraise remaining private lands on Moloka'i. This move was prompted by Act 55, passed in the fall of 1893, which authorized the minister to take possession of any land and property on Moloka'i that the Board of Health required. The act stipulated thirty days' notice to the occupants before the government could take possession. To accomplish the transfer of ownership, an attempt was first made to agree with the owners on the amount to be paid for the land. If no agreement or compromise could be reached, three disinterested persons or commissioners were appointed to ascertain a just compensation to the landowners. 107 On November 30, 1894, a notice to kama'\"ainas was signed by the president of the Board of Health and given to all parties at the leprosy settlement whose kuleanas had been or were being taken by the government for the better implementation of the Act of Segregation to Prevent the Spread of Leprosy. The notice stated that beginning on May 15, 1894, their kuleanas were considered the property of the government. Every portion of the peninsula, all the roads from LeinaoPapio at Waikolu to Kalaupapa landing, to Nihoa and including it, and all trails or roads to the top of the mountains to Kala'e now compromised the leprosy settlement on Moloka'i. Any parties found on these ,lands without a permit 107.

Last Years of Nineteenth Century 1. Work Performed by Department of Forestry, 1897 At the end of 1897 William Clark, forester at the leprosy settlement, submitted a report of work accomplished by the Department of Forestry at the settlement for the year ending December 31. During the past several months he and two helpers had been involved in planting and distributing the stock of trees on hand at the nursery. In addition to planting trees in the gulches of the old crater, Clark noted that more than 8,500 trees were set in Waiha'nau Valley. The roof of the nursery building had been altered by substituting glass sash for the cloth sections first installed, thereby improving the lighting and solving maintenance problems. 109 An 1897 article in the Damien Institute mentioned that the government nursery grounds were located just above Kalawao. The forester had planted about 10,000 young trees raised from seedlings. Most of them were ironwood, many of which had been planted in the volcano crater. 110 2. Building Construction Major construction by the Board of Health at Kalawao ended with erection of the Baldwin Home for Men and Boys. A few years previously the Board of Health had suggested that the patients should be moved to Kalaupapa on the western shore of the peninsula where the climate was better, a good dock was available, and the larger area facilitated expansion. The beginning of the twentieth century brought 108. 1891-1894, Lands--Kalaupapa, Hansen's Disease Records, Hawaii State Archives, Honolulu. 109. Wm. Clark, Forester, Leper Settlement, to Wm. 0.

One major complex was still to be built at Kalawao, but because it was under a separate administration, it will be treated separately in the I next chapter. I 250 VIII. UNITED STATES LEPROSY INVESTIGATION STATION A. Establishment of Federal Leprosarium 1. Motivation The vagaries of the political and social trends in Honolulu through the years had little effect upon the pace of life at the leprosy settlement on Moloka'i. Indeed , its residents were often unaware of how rapidly changes were being made. After King Kalskaua's death in 1891, his sister, Princess Liliuokalani, ascended the throne. Honolulu's businessmen, impatient with the old ways and anxious for annexation by the United States, deposed her in 1893 and ended the monarchy. A short succession of trial regimes followed: the Provisional Government of 1893 to 1894, the Republic of Hawai'i from 1894 to 1898, annexation by the United States in 1898, and finally, creation of the Territory of Hawai'i in 1900. Throughout these unsettling times, the everyday administration of the leprosy settlement was largely unaffected. The first decade of the twentieth century would begin to see some startling physical changes on the peninsula, however, and none would be as spectacular as Uncle Sam's first visible effort to attack the problem of leprosy in Hawai'i. On March 3, 1905, the 58th U.S. Congress passed the \"Act to Provide for the Investigation of Leprosy,\" with special reference to the care and treatment of leprosy victims in Hawai'i. By this act, the U.S. Public Health and Marine-Hospital Service was given the responsibility of building and administering a federal leprosarium. Credit for instigating this action by Congress was given to Dr. Charles B. Cooper, president of the Hawai'i Territorial Board of Health, who put out a ten-page pamphlet in 1904 entitled Leprosy in the Hawaiian Islands--Its -- Humanitarian and Financial Burden-- An Unparalleled Instance of Public - Philanthropy. In that document Cooper outlined the financial burden that leprosy had imposed on the Board of Health and developed a proposal for the federal government to aid in the scientific study and treatment of the disease. In a letter to the secretary of the treasury commenting on the bill and recommending its passage, Surgeon-General Walter Wyman stated that because the medical profession was practically as impotent in 251 Map No. 2.

An experimental station in Hawaii seemed a likely place to conduct such research; at Moloka'i the remoteness and isolation were perfect, there were a large number of patients readily available, and every type of the disease appeared at the settlement so that clinical features could be studied to advantage. The Territorial Government felt it needed help now because incidences of the disease were not decreasing and because maintenance of the settlement without prospect of a cure was seriously taxing the resources of the territ0ry.l President Theodore Roosevelt, with the support of Surgeon-General Wyman, Governor George R. Carter of Hawai'i, and the Hawai'ian Board of Health, recommended in his annual message to Congress on December 6, 1904, that the Marine-Hospital Service be empowered to establish a hospital and laboratory in the islands to study leprosy. The sum of $150,000 was appropriated for construction of facilities and the first year's maintenance. 1. Letter from the Surgeon-General to the Secretary of the Treasury, January IO, 1905, in Annual Report of the Surgeon-General of the Public -- Health & Marine-Hospital Service of the United States for theFEa= -- 1905 (Washington: ----- Government Printing Office, 1906), pp. 200-201. The Public Health Service was originally called the Marine Hospital Service and had its origin in a 1798 act that authorized hospitals for the care of sick and disabled American merchant seamen. Subsequent legislation broadened the scope of its activities. In 1902 the name was changed to Public Health and Marine-Hospital Service and in 1912 to Public Health Service. It was under the jurisdiction of the Treasury Department from 1798 to July 1, 1939. The Public Health Service was under the direction of a Surgeon-General and, among other things, was responsible for research in the cause, prevention, and control of disease. Walter Wyman served as Surgeon General of the Public Health and Marine-Hospital Service from 1891 to 191 I. 255 2. Land In exchange for the federal government's financial and scientific assistance in the project, the Territory of Hawai'i agreed to cede title to one square mile of land on Moloka'i to the federal government for construction of the buildings. On the morning of June 10, 1905, the Kalaupapa leprosy settlement brass band greeted a VIP group of federal and territorial officials who had come to select an appropriate location for the station. Wyman picked the site at Kalawao as being most suitable, and on June 28, 1905, the Governor of Hawai'i ceded the one-mile-square plot of land to the federal government in perpetuity. The station would be situated amid one of the largest aggregations of leprosy sufferers in the world, and in addition the site was thought to have a cool, healthy location, beautiful surroundings, an ample water supply, and a convenient landing place. The Kalawao plat was described thusly: The Kalawao plat proper North Boundary, the ocean. East Boundary, a line running from the sea in a south-easterly direction along the foot of the plateau at the mouth of Waialea Valley to a point which shall be decided by the surveyor as one ensuring the retaining of enough land by the Territory to preserve its taro, grazing and firewood interests. West Boundary, a line running in a southwesterly direction from the ocean along the East side of the Baldwin Home and Roman Church to a point in Waialeia Valley to correspond to the terminus of the East boundary. North Boundary, th2 line connecting the termini of the East and West boundaries. A resolution of the question of ownership of the land was attempted by the U .S. District Attorney, who wrote that at the time of 2. Leland Cofer, Passed Asst. Surgeon, Chief Quarantine Officer, Territory of HawaiIi, to Surgeon-General, U.S. Public Health and Marine-Hospital Service, June 15, 1905, General Files, 1897-1923, RG 90, NA, p. 10. 256 the proclamation the land set apart belonged to the Territory of Hawai'i, the title resting on undisturbed possession for about thirty years rather than on a record title. The land set apart was all within the three ahupua'as of Waikolu, Kalawao, and Makanalua. The district attorney's conclusion, after examining the records, was that all of the land, orginally covered by patents, had been reconveyed to the Kingdom of Hawai'i : If all of these conveyances were correct, made by the proper parties, and agree in survey, etc., the record title would necessarily be clear; but when a comparison is commenced, one gets into endless confusion. In many instances the surveys will not agree; in others, there is no description at all, sufficient to identify the land conveyed, save by reference to Patent number; again, the records will show a given person as the patentee, while the deed transferring the land covered by that patent, will be from an entirely different person or persons, with nothing of record to trace the connection between the patentee and the grantor in the deed. This arose from the loose methods of transacting business and keeping records in the Kingdom of Hawaii. It is nevertheless clear, from an examination of the records, that an attempt was made by the Kingdom of Hawaii, to purchase for health purposes, all of the lands covered by the Patents and Land Commission Awards. . . . clear that, for almost thirty years, the It is further very Gover ment of Hawaii has been in undisturbed possession of the land. 9 There existed thirty old frame houses on the proposed reservation, many of which were occupied by patients, either owned by individuals or by the territory. Ten of them were located along the road immediately east of the Baldwin Home. It was debated whether people should live there during construction, and finally it was thought best to have the reservation vacated and all personal property removed. The Board of Health was notified and the matter of claims for damages was put before the territorial authorities. F.W. Pease, Inspector of Repairs of the Marine-Hospital Service, wrote: 3. Robt. W. Breckons, U.S. General, District Attorney, to the Attorney August 4, 1905, File 1500, General Files, 1897-1923, Record Group 90 (Records of the Public Health Service), National Archives, Washington, D.C., p. 3. 257 The question was asked me if the United States Government would pay for the houses etc., on the reservation, belonging to private parties, the appraisement of the value being upwards of $4,000.00, I replied that the appropriation for the construction of the station would not permit of such an expense, whereupon a new appraisement was made by the President of the Board of Health the Superintendent and assistant Superintgndent of the Leper Settlement, the amount of which was $2,270. The territorial legislature later appropriated money to pay all claims. After much delay, the occupants were moved to Kalaupapa, the buildings were demolished, and after everything of value had been removed, the rubbish and debris were burned. After thorough inspection of the area, it had been determined that the purpose of the 1905 act could best be fulfilled by selecting various areas of land in different localities for separate purposes . First 114 acres were selected on the grassy slope above Kalawao bay for the site of the hospital; the next choice was 8.9 acres out on the coast for a landing site; then 4.5 acres around a spring in Waikolu Valley were reserved as a possible future water source. The spring, right of way thereto, and an area surrounding the spring were included. A large tract in Makanalua (502.6 acres) was also reserved as pasture land for station livestock. 3. Construction The supervisory architect of the Treasury Department informed the Surgeon-General that the proposed federal buildings were to be very simple in style. They would rest on wooden posts and have shingled roofs; the exterior walls would be wood studs covered with sheathing and finished with either clapboards or shingles. Interior partitions would be studs covered with tongue and groove sheathing or 4. F.W. Pease, Inspector of Repairs, Public Health & Marine-Hospital Service, to Surgeon-General, December 26, 1907, in ibid., p. 5. 258 plastered. 5 The station was to be divided into three compounds: Residence, Hospital, and Administration (Executive). The director of the new station, Dr. Walter 6. Brinckerhoff, appointed on March 2, 1906, recommended that the three compounds be enclosed by a picket fence four . feet high with vertical pickets four inches wide set at four-inch intervals. 6 A supplementary recommendation a week later was that a verandah eight feet wide be put along the southwest side (side away from the sea) of the hospital buildings, on the east and west wards, opposite the single rooms and opposite the four-bed wards. Windows opening on the verandah would go to the floor. A verandah on both sides of the wards was necessary because the patients were sensitive to the cold, and it would add to their comfort to be able to sit on either side of the building according to the wind direction. 7 5.

Brinckerhoff had been instructor of pathology at Harvard University Medical School for eight years. When the law establishing the station went into effect in early 1905, an effort was made to obtain the volunteered services of a regular Public Health and Marine-Hospital Service officer, but to no avail. Realizing it might be difficult to get someone for the job, the act authorized payment to a commissioned or noncommissioned officer of the service detailed for duty at the station, in addition to the pay of his grade, one-half the pay of this grade, plus other allowances as might be provided by the Surgeon-General with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. It proved impossible to find a qualified man willing to isolate himself, until Brinckerhoff agreed. He was appointed Director March 2, 1906, and resigned May 31, 1909. To carry out the intent of the act, it was found necessary to make preliminary investigations at the receiving station in Honolulu, the only place where cases in their earliest development could be found and where suspected cases not yet developed could be examined. The laboratory director, handling both executive and technical duties, was expected to spend his time between both Honolulu and Kalawao. Memorandum for the Secretary of the Treasury Regarding the Appointment of Doctor Brinckerhoff as Assistant Director and Doctor Hollmann as Acting Assistant Surgeon at the Leprosy Investigation Station, Molokai, Hawaii, July 3, 1909, in 7. Walter R. Brinckerhoff, Director, Leprosy I nvestigation Station, to Surgeon-General, U . S. Public Health and Marine-Hospital Service, May 12, 1906, in ibid. 259 On September 6, 1907, F. W. Pease, Inspector of Repairs of the Marine-Hospital Service, was detailed by the Secretary of the Treasury to proceed to Hawaii to prepare plans and specifications and to construct the hospital station and laboratory. His progress report on the preliminary phase of construction was completed the end of December. In it he noted that he had visited the reservation and Kalaekiloi'a point, reserved by the federal government and upon which it proposed to build a new landing platform. Access to the point was precarious, the trail at the foot of the bluff, about 1% miles long, being impassable except by foot or by pack mules, who used it to carry taro-root from the taro patches up Waikolu Valley to the Kalaupapa settlement. In view of the estimated cost of $15,000 to $25,000 to construct a landing at Kalaekiloi'a point and a road from the point to the selected site, Pease decided that it would be better to use the Kalaupapa landing and transport the building material and supplies by team over the existing road to the site. The territorial Board of Health had already given permission to use that landing and the hand-powered derrick, which was operated by residents of the settlement. Because the workers tired quickly, however, Pease suggested that it might become necessary to install a hoisting engine with drum to operate the derrick. The quantity of lumber, shingles, and other materials scheduled would be sufficient for the director's quarters, pharmacist's quarters, storehouse, stable, shops, animal pens, powerhouse, cold storage facility, and for the temporary barracks and dining room for workmen . Pease had witnessed the landing of a lot of lumber at the Kalaupapa breakwater in mid-November. The steamer approached to within about 1,000 feet of shore and anchored, whereupon the lumber, made up into bundles of about 1,000 square feet, was bound securely and thrown overboard. On coming to the surface, the end of the binding rope was caught by someone in a landing boat and the small raft was towed through the surf to the beach. There the rope end was passed to the shore, made fast to the derrick rope, and the lumber raft raised onto the shore. 260 Because the landing at Kalaupapa was dangerous, the mules would be landed at Kaunakakai on the south side of Moloka'i. From there they would be driven over the mountains and down the pali trail. The trail was three feet wide and cut out of the cliff face in short stretches of about twenty-five percent grade, zig-zagging down to the foot of the mountains. There was always danger of slipping and of falling rock, but still it was deemed less dangerous for animals than to put them overboard at Kalaupapa to swim to shore through the surf and rocks. The concrete piers, foundations, and floors of the station buildings would be made with Portland cement. There was a quantity of loose rock on the site and sand was available from the beach near Kalaupapa. A stone crusher was in operation at Kalaupapa and its owners agreed to clear the building site, crush the loose rock, and pile it adjacent to the building locations. 8 After the plans and specifications for the construction of the buildings had been prepared by the supervising architect, advertisement was made for bids. After several unexpected delays, the bids were opened on March 4, 1907, at which time it was discovered that the lowest one was far in excess of the amount of money available. Attempts were made to obtain supplemental bids based on modifications of the original plans, but with no success. By May 31, 1907, the Treasury Department had rejected all bids. Consideration was then given to buying the required material and erecting the structures by day labor under the superintendence of an agent of the department. This plan was adopted. The Inspector of Repairs was sent to Honolulu with orders to prepare the necessary drawings, purchase building materials, contract for labor and transportation, and superintend construction. 8. Pease to Surgeon-General, December 26, 1907, in ibid., pp. 1-4. On December 30, portions of the supplies, mules, wagons-nd men were shipped to the island. 261 4. The Station Takes Shape On January 2, 1908, work commenced on the temporary barracks and dining room building for the workmen. By August 1908 it was reported that the director's and pharmacist's quarters were ready for laying the floors; the storage building was practically complete; the powerhouse and cold storage buildings were ready for siding; the framing for the attendants' building and the administrative building was camp I eted , as was that for the walls of the laboratory building and the covered way between the laboratory and administration building; the concrete foundation piers for the morgue, lavoratory, and laundry buildings were in place; the frames for the piers for the hospital, kitchen, and surgery room were being placed; and the construction of the stable and barn would follow. It was proposed to install an electric generator and light the buildings with electricity; the generator would be powered by water, if possible.' 5. Boat Landing At the same time that the area of land at Kalawao was selected for a hospital site, another parcel of land was set aside for the station by the territory that included the boat landing at Makaluahau Cove and all the land on the western exposure of the adjacent hill, as well as the right-of-way over the path leading from the reservation proper around the foot of the cliff and along the beach to the landing. After the construction of the station buildings had commenced, it became apparent that the Makaluahau landing should be improved to enable landing passengers and supplies. This was because the only available means of access to the station at that time was through the leprosy settlement, two and a half miles away, through which the U.S. had no right-of-way. Permission to land there and pass through 9. F.W. Pease to Surgeon-General, Public Health and Marine-Hospital Service, August 21, 1908, in ibid., pp. l-2. 262 had to be requested as a privilege from the Board of Health, a pass signed by the director being required of each person going or coming from the station. Not only was the Kalaupapa landing difficult and dangerous, but Brinckerhoff felt it objectionable to have foodstuffs for station personnel handled by the sick or by persons in daily contact with them. It was also unfortunate, he felt, that persons landing would be needlessly exposed to the disease. Another landing spot would not only avoid this problem but would also avoid friction with local health officials. The new landing would also emphasize the independence of the station from the settlement, which would be an asset when trying to employ workers. An item regarding this problem was therefore included in the estimates to Congress, and in the act making appropriations for the sundry civil expenses of the government for the year ending June 30, 1909, an appropriation of $1,000 was made to construct a boat landing for the use of the leprosy investigation station. Mr. Pease was instructed to complete the job, and in his report of June 28, 1909, he stated the landing had been built for $993.31, including construction of a footbridge over Wai kolu Stream to afford access to the landing. An approach to the landing was formed by throwing the beach boulders into the sea. A portion of the lava rock bluff overhanging the landing site was blasted off, timber work was constructed, and the surface of the lava rock shelf at the bluff base and the floor of the boulder approach were covered with concrete, including walks from the beach. The landing was 112 feet long, with an average width of 12 feet. 10 IO. Walter R.

Garden In early 1909, Brinckerhoff requested authority to estab)ish a vegetable garden at the station to supply fresh vegetables to the personnel and green feed for the laboratory animals (rabbits, guinea pigs, and the like). Such an enterprise would help prevent the station's 114 acres from growing up into an unsightly wilderness of weeds and brush. The workmen had been raising their vegetables for the past year and found the soil and climate ideal. Plenty of pasture would still be left for milch cows, sheep, and other necessary animals. 11 b. Workmen It was deemed necessary to isolate the station workmen from the leprosy settlement by confining them to the bounds of the portion of the government reservation on which the buildings were to be erected. Chinese were favored as being easily controlled and indifferent to isolation, while their labor was obtainable at reasonable rates. Also they would provide their own food. 12 C. Staff The following attendants were specified by Brinckerhoff as being necessary from time to time as their specific services were required: 11. Walter R. Brinckerhoff to Surgeon-General, Public Health and Marine-Hospital Service, February 18, 1909, File 1500, General Files, 1897-1923, RG 90, NA. In March Brinckerhoff specified that one acre would be needed for corn and potatoes, two acres for other vegetables, and two acres for panicum grass or sorghum for stock fodder. Letter to the.

Courtesy National Archives, Washington, D. C. For the first year or so, several outside men would be required to grade the grounds, plant trees, set lawns, build roads and walks, and fence pastures. Already employed were a stenographer, engineer, carpenter, seamstress, and laboratory attendant. Altogether twenty-three employees were envisioned, with one director, two assistant medical men, and one pharmacist. Foreseeing some hesitation on the part of his superiors to approve such a large staff, Brinckerhoff pointed out that This list of employees seems large, for a hospital of I6 beds, at the first glance, but when it is considered that this is a hospital and laboratory station, with the necessity of duplicating kitchen and laundries on account of the nature of the disease treated, the interior painting of the buildings, the large number of animals that will be necessary for the laboratory work and the isolated location of the Hospital site, it that the number is not in excess of the needs of 7. Construction Proqresses The first permanent building erected was the storage building, followed by the power house and cold storage building, director's quarters, pharmacist's quarters, administration and laboratory buildings, attendants' quarters, morgue, lavatory, laundry, hospital, surgery, and stable. Because of the large quantity of lumber required, proposals were invited from local lumber firms for supplying lumber by vessel from the Pacific Coast. All lumber and equipment had to be either floated ashore or loaded into small boats from the decks of inter-island steamers. A steady water supply was of course a necessity for the proper functioning of the various duties of the station. Back in 1906 the Board of Health had given permission for the Marine-Hospital Service to connect with the eight-inch main of the settlement water system and take a supply of water not to exceed a maximum of 200,000 gallons each 13. Walter R. Brinckerhoff, Director, Leprosy Investigation Station, to Surgeon-General, Public Health and Marine-Hospital Service, February 25, 1909, in ibid., p. 4. 272 twenty-four hours. For this service, the federal government would pay the territory two hundred dollars a year. 14 An extension of the water supply system of the settlement was deemed necessary to provide the additional water needed for both the settlement and the station, and this was completed under the direction of the Superintendent of Public Works of the Territory of Hawai'i by the summer of 1909. To ensure a continuous and bountiful supply of water to the settlement and the station, the eight-inch-diameter pipeline was extended higher up Waikolu Valley to a new and additional perennial water source , enabling 480,000 gallons of water to be discharged each twenty-four-hour day. Check-valves and air valves were used to regulate the input to the main pipe from the several springs in the valley, thus ensuring a continuous flow. An ample sewer system was provided, with one line from the director's and pharmacist's quarters, the other from the administration and hospital buildings, both discharging into the sea at the low water line. A complete plumbing system was installed in all the buildings, including sinks, water closets, lavatories, bathtubs, showers, slop sinks, and also garden hose outlets and fire hose standpipes in the grounds adjacent to the buildings. The electric lighting system installed was run by a thirty-horsepower gasoline engine and direct-current dynamo, generating 17% kilowatts supplying 290 sixteen-candlepower lamps. The combined ice-making and refrigeration plant had a capacity of one ton and could produce about 1,000 pounds of ice per day. It was operated by a twelve-inch-diameter water wheel. A fifty-light gas machine was also installed to supply gas for use in the laboratory, surgery, and elsewhere. 14. L.E. Pinkham, President, Board of Health, to Walter R.

The shingle roofs were stained green. A post and picket fence with gates was built on one side of the right-of-way across the reservation, and also on a line separating the' hospital from the administration compound (see Illustration 47). The hospital accommodated about fourteen patients with ample space for a nurse, kitchen, dining room, bath rooms, and toilet room. The attendants' quarters held twelve rooms, plus a dining room, kitchen, laundry, and toilet rooms. The stable had six stalls, a feed room, harness room, and wagon space. The buildings were of wood on concrete foundations and of the bungalow type. The floor and porch space of all the buildings equalled 48,000 square feet. Average height of ceilings was twelve feet. The large porch spaces permitted outdoor living and were intended to make more bearable the prolonged high temperatures of the area. As it turned out, the porches of the director's and pharmacist's quarters had to be enclosed because their exposure to storms resulted in rain being driven across the porches and into the rooms. Constant mopping was the result. It was proposed that porches be enclosed with glass on the most exposed sides (see Illustration 45). Use of the old hand-powered derrick at Kalupapa soon became unsuitable. Not only did it take too long to hoist the material from the boats to the wharf, but the Board of Health also proposed to charge for the labor involved in handling the materials and supplies. When an opportunity arose to purchase a second-hand steam hoisting engine at a reasonable price, the federal government jumped at it, and the new engine was soon installed. Not long afterwards, the old derrick broke, and a new, stronger one was erected by the territorial government. 1.5 l 0 15. F.W. Pease, Inspector of Repairs, Public Health and Marine-Hospital Service, to Surgeon-General, July 1, 1909, in l 280 - 8. Work of the Station Walter R. Brinckerhoff resigned as director of the station in 1909. He and his wife had never lived on Moloka'i. Instead, Brinckerhoff decided to work at Kalihi Hospital near Honolulu. This was probably due as much to his preoccupation with staying germ-free as with his society wife's determination to never set foot on the island. Upon her death in childbirth in 1909, Dr. Brinckerhoff resigned the directorship and declined in mental and physical health. He died in Boston two years later. He was succeeded by Donald H. Currie, a scientist of the regular corps of the Marine-Hospital Service, previously on duty in Honolulu, who had been interested in Brinckerhoff's investigations and volunteered to take his place. In a letter of late 1909 he outlined the planned work of the station for the next few years. Original research and studies were to be conducted on the culture of the bacillus of leprosy, on the transmission of the bacillus, on the infection of lower animals with leprosy, and on the products of certain bacteria to ascertain if a substance of therapeutic or diagnostic value could be obtained. Animals to be employed in this research were rabbits, hares, guinea pigs, wild rats, wild mice, white rats, white mice, dogs, cats, goats, swine, pigeons, chickens, and monkeys (old world, prehensile-tailed, and apes). Dr. Harry Hollmann would perform routine medical and surgical treatment of patients, administer certain special remedies, keep complete clinical records including photographs of cases, and pursue other miscellaneous studies. The station would also periodically publish preliminary reports and short articles for the use of health officers and general practitioners. 16 9. Opening of the Station The buildings of the Kalawao Leprosy Investigation Station were finished by July 1, 1909, but because of the possible danger of transmission of the disease by flies, mosquitoes, or other insects, the 16.

C. 284 station had to be thoroughly screened before patients could be admitted. The making of the necessary wire cloth and its transport from the eastern United States to Honolulu took longer than anticipated. Investigations at the temporary laboratory in Honolulu continued during this delay and would continue, as stated earlier, after the main station opened because the incipient cases there provided the best opportunity for studying early methods of diagnosis and means of relief. Experiments on animals and other systematic investigations of a clinical and laboratory nature could best be carried out on Moloka'i. Each line of investigation assisted the other and both worked toward the important results for which the station was established. The Kalawao Leprosy Investigation Station, whose buildings and equipment cost about $80,000, opened on December 23, 1909, for the reception of patients. Staff consisted of Donald H. Currie, director; Walter R. Brinckerhoff, assistant director; Harry T. Hollmann, medical assistant; Frank L. Gibson, pharmacist and administrative officer in charge of the building project; John Kluge, translator and librarian; and Ernst A. von Arnswaldt, technical assistant and translator. Dr. Brinckerhoff, as mentioned earlier, resigned as director of the station on May 31, 1909, and his duties were taken up by Dr. Currie. However, Brinckerhoff was willing to accept the position of assistant director, and it was decided to retain his services so that there would be no break in the line of scientific investigations that he had started. IO. Recollections of Mrs. Frank L. Gibson Our best day-to-day descriptions of life at the Moloka'i station were penned by the wife of the station pharmacist. An intelligent and adventuresome young bride, Emma Gibson thoroughly delighted in her husband's Hawai'ian post. The following are some of her observations. a. Structures The station was divided into three compounds Residence, Executive, and Hospital. The Executive, or Administration, compound included storehouses, quarters for thirty-two Chinese workmen, the ice house, laboratories, cages for the animals, and a barn. Though 287 Pease had charge of the building plans, an island contractor, William Mutch, did the work. Brinckerhoff, germ conscious to the extent that he would not have rugs or draperies in his house, also stipulated all single-face walls in the structures so that mice and rats could not hide out and breed as they might between double walls. The entire station was surrounded by a double fence, ten feet apart, to insure no outside contact. A twenty-foot runway in the hospital compound paralleled the patients' rooms. Covered by a roof, it was open on three sides and held wash basins for the convenience of the doctors. Regarding their own house, Mrs. Gibson recalled that the floor was painted jet black to soften the glare of the ocean's reflection . The la'nai screens had been made of copper to prevent corrosion by the salt spray, but the green dust that soon covered the ocean-side IEinais forced their enclosure by sliding glass windows. This also lessened storm damage. The back IZnais were left open to the mountains. The upstairs Enai had hammocks, chairs, and couches, and each room opened onto the Enai through French doors. The electric fans supplied were seldom used because of the cool breezes. b. Island Growth The Gibsons planted several hundred three-inch-high ironwood trees brought from the Honolulu Agricultural Station, which by the time they left, were higher than the house. She also mentioned that in the valley back of the station were found abundant tropical flowers as well as orchards--papayas, peaches, plums, apples, sour cherries, figs, and guavas. Bananas, grapes, pineapples, and coconuts grew on the hillsides. Watermelons also thrived. The lantana shrub grew wild and frequently had to be cleared out of the pastures where it tended to make life miserable for the milk cows. Algaroba (kiawe) trees grew in the valley and kukui trees lined the trail to Kalaupapa settlement. C. Trails Gibson had a \"hunting lodge\" in the mountains over the cliffs, and there he stalked herds of deer and wild goats. The trail Up the cliff was described as steep and precarious, chains having been 288 I 0 0 a inserted in several places in the dirt and rock to help climbers pull themselves up. This trail was back of the Gibson house. d. Boat Landings The trip from Honolulu to Moloka'i took the better part of three days when Mrs. Gibson first went to Kalawao, with several stops along the way to pick up and deliver passengers and supplies. The only decent wharf on Moloka'i was at Kaunakakai, over the pali on the other side of the island. It was reached by horseback over the pali trail. Kalaupapa had its unimproved landing--a platform only for loading and unloading into surf boats that relayed passengers and supplies back and forth from the steamers. From there huge bullock wagons were used to get to Kalawao, because the rocks and holes made the going too tough for horses. At Waikolu (Alapa'i Point near Makaluahau Cove), the nearest point of landing to the station, disembarkation necessitated jumping into a small rowboat from a steamer, floating toward the shore, and waiting for the right moment to leap onto the land. From there a stone path at the base of the cliffs led to the station. 17 e. Relationship with Brother Dutton The station had a private post office, with Gibson as postmaster and his wife as assistant. Brother Dutton's extensive correspondence also went through this post office and was delivered to his messenger at the station gate. Dutton often visited the Gibsons at the station, especially for Thanksgiving and Christmas meals. To prevent possible contamination, he would come in fresh clean garments for each visit. A special and enduring friendship grew up between the Gibsons and Brother Dutton, who undoubtedly enjoyed the change of scenery and the short walk over to the station from the Baldwin Home. 11. Limited Operation of the Station Prior to April 1909, all apprehended leprosy victims were sent to the colony on Moloka'i. On April 14, 1909, the territorial 17.

The act further stated that no patient would be taken to the settlement until he had been at the hospital for at least six months, unless at least three licensed physicians felt he could not benefit from further treatment there. The effect of the act was to detain all incipient cases at the hospital, precluding the study of early cases at the station on Moloka'i. In addition, only nine patients volunteered for treatment and research at the Kalawao station. Although during the building process the leprosy sufferers made daily treks to watch the activity, in the end there was no desire on their part to confine themselves to the mercies of the latest medical equipment. To people accustomed to ministrations by devoted missionaries such as Father Damien, Brother Dutton, and Mother Marianne, as well as by various clergymen, Board of Health employees, and others who had no qualms about mingling with the patients, the sterile atmosphere, locked gates, and unfamiliar equipment of the station held no attraction. No more patients were ever admitted. The complete isolation of the station, in terms of lack of patients and thus opportunities for research and experimentation, did not bode well for its future. The station at Kalihi seemed much more viable as a headquarters for experiments. Because the greatest field for investigation appeared to be on Oahu, and because it was found that transferring investigations from Moloka'i to the Kalihi receiving station reduced costs, Currie was authorized at the beginning of fiscal year 1911 to limit operations on Moloka'i and transfer the scientific and laboratory staff to Kalihi where the work would be continued in buildings furnished by the territory. Station records were still kept on Moloka'i and correspondence was conducted from there. Otherwise it was utilized primarily as a depot of operations. The only improvements or repairs made were those considered absolutely necessary for maintenance. Soon after the beginning of the fiscal year, workers at the station announced their successful cultivation of the leprosy bacillus on artificial media. Cultivation of the bacillus, a great advance in the scientific investigation 290 0 - of the disease, had first been accomplished by M.T. Clegg in 1909. 18 Dr. George W. McCoy became director of the leprosy station on October 23, 1911, and served until 1915. During 1912 time was spent doing experimental work in the treatment of leprosy by vaccine and serum therapy. Research was also done on possible transmission of the disease by lice, bedbugs, fleas, flies, and mosquitoes. During most of fiscal year 1913, both the Honolulu and Moloka'i laboratories were in operation. While the assistant director and acting assistant surgeon worked in Honolulu, the director spent most of his time at the Kalawao lab, where a better supply of pathological material was provided through the cooperation of Dr. W. J. Goodhue, who in 1902 had become medical superintendent of the settlement. 19 By the next year, however, the buildings and fences were beginning to show signs of wear and decay due to their proximity to the sea, exposure to winds, and excessive rain. Much of the old fence had blown down and it was suggested that stone fences, such as those generally used in the settlement, might last longer. Dr. McCoy and Leighton Gibson finally closed the station on August 7, 1913. There was still a station post office at Kalawao in 1915, conducted by a non-leprous person and handling \"clean\" mail only. It was located in the pharmacist's office, in the executive building, in the administrative compound. The office was begun primarily to provide mail service for \"clean\" persons at the federal station, but it now handled all mail for Kalawao and all \"clean\" outgoing mail. the Surgeon-General of the Public Health and ofthe United States %-the w Y - Fiscal Year 1911 --- : GovernmentPrxing Office,),pp>l-73. 19.

The station also performed bacteriological work for the territorial Board of Health, while the director functioned as sanitary advisor to the Governor of Hawai'i and served as a member of the Sanitary Code Commission of the territory. The end was near for the Moloka'i station, however. Not only was the Kalihi station more convenient and accessible, but it had continued to be impossible to induce the native Hawai'ian patients to enter the Kalawao hospital, a fact that had greatly hindered investigations there. By 1917 the station records and library had also been moved to the Kalihi office of the station. From there the station director supervised three caretakers at Kalawao. No scientific investigations were being conducted on Moloka'i. Soon thereafter, the station at Kalawao was dismantled and its property transferred to Honolulu. By January 1921 the empty station was left in the charge of a single caretaker. At that point the territorial government requested that the buildings be put under its control so that the structures and/or materials could be used in another part of the settlement to add to the efficiency of treatment and comfort of the residents. This seemed a logical argument. Because the buildings could not be used for the purpose for which they had been designed, they would only continue to be a source of expense for maintenance and preservation in their original location. The Public Health Service had already removed all salvageable equipment. A bill providing for the transfer of the federal leprosy station buildings and land at Kalawao from the federal government to the Territory of Hawai'i was approved by the President of the United States on September 21, 1922. Custody of the property was relinquished on December 1. 20 In the late 1920s the old federal buildings were still standing at Kalawao. A newspaper article regarding a visit by legislators noted that: 20. Assorted documents, File 1500, General Files, 1897-1923, RG 90, NA. 292 0 - A half mile from the Baldwin home is the federal leprosy station built several years ago at a cost of $300,000 and later abandoned. The legislators visited the station and found that the buildings are still in relatively good shape. The 1927 legislature appropriated $10,000 for the removal of the structures from Kalawao to Kalaupapa but the territory has not been able to get any one to take the contract. Superintendent Cooke informed the party that arrangements have been made with homesteaders on the lee side of Molokai to remove the structures to the vill se on a daily wage basis and the work is to be started April 1. Finally, in 1929, the old station was torn down and materials salvaged were taken to Kalaupapa for use in the repair of existing buildings. The research activity carried on at the U .S. Leprosy Investigation Station at Kalihi Hospital, directed and financed by the National Institute of Health, which continued up until the beginning of World War II, was an important contribution to the territory's public health program. The proximity to Honolulu physicians and surgeons made the federal scientists available for consultation and other cooperative endeavors in the field of scientific, research and also afforded opportunities to meet with other scientists temporarily stationed in Honolulu or passing through. The Kalihi Hospital for a time had the potential of serving as a research center of world interest and importance. 21 .

PIONEER KALAUPAPA SETTLEMENT PERIOD, 1900-1929 A. Existing Conditions 1. Cemeteries In 1901 two benevolent societies had been formed for the purpose of saving and taking care of graves on the peninsula. Cemeteries existed both at Kalawao and Kalaupapa. Graves without a fence were taken care of by the Board of Health, while those enclosed by fences were under the care of the societies. The fences were erected to keep cattle from walking over the graves.T 2. School In 1901 only one school existed in the settlement, at Kalaupapa. Lessons were conducted in English. Fifty-one students learned reading, writing, and a little math. 2 B. New Construction At the turn of the century a number of old, deteriorating buildings were still in use on the peninsula. Conditions and structures would gradually improve over the next several years as the Board of Health began implementing a plan to create, by the close of the 1907-1909 period, a finished village superior in its utilities, services, and facilities to any village of a like number of inhabitants. Although not all its goals were met, a start was made during this period to create a much more modern medical facility. 1. Another Community Home: Bay View Complex By late 1900 or early 1901 the superintendent of the settlement was erecting a \"boarding house\" for those leprosy patients 1.

The earliest physical description of the complex mentions only a verandah four feet wide. 4 By July 1901 it was reported that the Bay View Home was crowded with inmates and applications for admission were coming in daily.5 Evidently this was cause for a new addition to the home and general painting and whitewashing by the end of the month .6 The first of August it was stated that carpentry work on the addition to Bay View would be finished that week. 7 An August 8 requisition was noted for more six-foot laths needed to finish covering the lanai at Bay View. 8 Work continued into the winter, when it was reported that ten more feet had been added to the home, making eight rooms instead of seven.g In 1904 the main building of the Bay View Home was repaired and remodeled. The four-foot verandah was widened to eight feet, stretching along both sides of the building. Transoms for ventilation were cut over the doors of each room, and openings were cut 3.

A new bathhouse with hot and cold water attachments and toilets was added. In addition, all unsanitary outbuildings were removed and the entire main building was painted and whitewashed. 10 It was considered one of the most comfortable homes in the settlement. Nurses were on duty around the clock to assist these residents, in whom leprosy was more advanced. By 1911 the Bay View Home reportedly had twenty-six improperly ventilated rooms, each measuring eight by nine feet, with eight-foot ceilings. 11 Fire, a recurring problem at the settlement, destroyed the first Bay View Home in the 1914/15 period. Construction began immediately on a new Bay View, with four cottages and a dining room. 12 By 1917 three buildings of the new home had been built, plus kitchens, storerooms, and two dining rooms. The new home, to accommodate ninety-six patients, opened July 6, 1917. 13 The next year the grounds were graded, grass sown, and fruit and ornamental trees planted. 14 10.

I7 The next year a new washhouse and laundry with a concrete floor was built. 18 By mid-1926 a meat storeroom had been added to the kitchen and dining room of the Bay View Home, and in 1928 an assembly hall was under construction. 19 2. Baldwin Home As mentioned earlier, the Baldwin Home remained at Kalawao until the early 1930s. Descriptions of the various changes to the home during the period 1900 to 1929 will, however, also be discussed in this section on construction at Kalaupapa settlement. The Baldwin Home continued to be managed by Brother Dutton, assisted by four Catholic brothers. The raising of hogs had been carried on at both the Baldwin 15.

The hogs were killed for the use of the residents. The practice had to be discontinued in the early 1900s because other people in the settlement resented not having such easy access to pork. Therefore a hog ranch was started near the slaughterhouse about 1902.20 Construction of a bathhouse at the Baldwin Home was started in the fall of 1901 .21 In 1903 a dispensary for the distribution of medicine and for treatment was erected close to the Baldwin Home and one of the brothers was put in charge. (Another dispensary was opened in the middle district of Makanalua, about equal distance between Kalawao and Kalaupapa. Surgical rooms were also added to each of the three homes. )22 The major problem at the Baldwin Home by 1904 was the system of dry earth closets. Because of the rocky ground, difficult to dig a proper vault, unless at great expense, and closets had to be moved every six months. A proper sewer needed to be laid by which everything would be carried out to it was so the system sea.23 In 1905 it was noted that the home dorms had all been reshingled and repaired, and all buildings had been painted and color washed. Tree planting and grounds improvement had also been carried 20. Report of the President of the Board of Health . . . for the Eighteen Mont& Ending December-2302, p. 286. -- 21.

By 1910 thousands of eucalyptus had been planted. (There was a regular need for their leaves and twigs at the Kalaupapa bathhouse. ) A new sewer system, the gift of the Honorable H. P. Baldwin, was installed by 1909, the work done by the residents under Brother Dutton's supervision. 24 By 1919 a new dispensary building, measuring fifteen feet square, with concrete floors, had been built. Also one hundred feet of picket fencing had been raised and a new gate with concrete posts erected. A lighting plant was installed by 1926.25 In 1929 forty members of the legislature and other territorial officials made a biennial inspection tour of the settlement. At the Baldwin Home the party listened to pleas by the twenty-eight inmates of the home that funds be appropriated to rebuild the home on its present site. The buildings had by now become dilapidated by the inroads of termites. It had been suggested for the last few years that the settlement be moved to Kalaupapa, for several reasons: it would be easier administratively and financially to have the residents in one place, there would be more room for expansion, the nearness of the harbor would facilitate supplying the residents, and communication with the outside world would be enhanced by the proximity of the pali trail. 26 Neither the residents nor the brothers of the Baldwin Home wished to move to Kalaupapa. The legislators pointed out that rebuilding the home at Kalawao was impractical and uneconomical because the home then 24.

Bishop Home In its early years, little was done to the Bishop Home complex other than general painting, whitewashing, and shingling. In fiscal year 1903/04, Charles Bishop donated money for a \"Home for Blind and Helpless Women at Kalaupapa.\" The structure, located on the Bishop Home grounds, was finished by June 1904 and consisted of two twenty by thirty-foot wards, a twenty by twenty-four-foot dining room, and a bath room. The dormitory had enough room to accommodate any patients that needed careful treatment and nursing. In the fall of 1904, Mother Marianne listed for Superintendent J. D. McVeigh several items or repairs that were needed for the home: improved bathing accommodations, bathtubs and general repairs in the old hospital building, a dressing room, a surgical operating room, and reshingling of the sisters' chapel roof .28 By that winter the Honorable Charles R. Bishop had donated $2,500 to make necessary alterations and additions at the home, including a new surgical and dressing room, a new bathhouse and tubs, a storeroom, and repairs to the sisters' house. 29 One of the first changes inaugurated upon McVeigh's assuming the superintendency of the settlement was to abolish the native cooking stove in the Bishop Home, which had consisted of an inverted kerosene tin filled with sand and charcoal. An outlying kitchen was built 27. John C.

By January 1905 there were 500 trees on the home grounds, consisting of oranges, lemons, plums, ironwood, and ornamental shrubbery. By the end of 1906 a new dormitory, capable of housing twenty people, had been erected at the Bishop Home at a cost of about $2,000.30 Improvements completed at the home during fiscal year 1906/07 included the new dormitory, a new bathhouse for medicated baths, and a new dispensary. In 1909, because many of the Bishop Home buildings were old and almost beyond repair, another $2,100 was appropriated by the legislature to build a new dormitory. The 1911 Board of Health report stated that the new dorm, to house twenty-four residents, was just being completed. Four older dorms built from lumber used at the old Kakaako Receiving Station were to be torn down. Some of that material would be used in constructing kitchens and outhouses in the settlement. 31 In 1913 a new picket fence was erected. Other improvements to the home during this time period included erection of heavy concrete posts and a gate during 1918/19 and installation of electric lights by 1922/23. 4. McVeigh Home (for White Foreigners) As mentioned earlier, the white patients at the settlement had a difficult time due to the fact that they were accustomed to different lifestyles and diet than the native Hawai'ian residents. Whites did not care as much for poi and were unable to get as much coffee, flour, sugar, potatoes, and other items as they wished. In 1908, a proposal for a home at the settlement for white leprosy victims was approved by the Board of Health. It was Superintendent McVeigh's idea that if a home for whites could be provided, with a common mess, the residents could 30.

By mid-1909 enough people had contributed funds to erect a special home for white foreigners that plans were drawn up for a building with twenty-four rooms, a kitchen, dining-room, social hall, and bathrooms, to cost about $12,000. Construction commenced and it was hoped to have the complex finished soon. 32 The McVeigh Home for White Foreigners, named after J. D. McVeigh, superintendent of the settlement from 1902 to 1929, 'opened in August 1910. By 1912 it consisted of twenty-five large bedrooms, a hospital ward, a dining room, and a social hall. 33 It had a ten-foot verandah on three sides. The high hopes that McVeigh held for the home did not materialize, however. By the next year, only eight whites still lived in a home that had accommodations for many more. Many of the former inmates had left because they preferred the freedom of life in the settlement cottages. 34 Therefore, beginning July 1, 1914, almost all the home's running expenses were drawn from the regular appropriations and other nationalities were allowed to live there in order to reduce expenses. A twenty-eight-foot concrete smokestack was built in 1918/19.

Waiamau, assistant superintendent of the settlement, wrote the superintendent, C. B. Reynolds, that work on the new visitors' compound site would be completed within the next few days. 37 A month later Waimau reported that the visitors' quarters at Kalawao were being repaired. It is possible that this was the building constructed in May. 38 b. At Kalaupapa In June 1906 it was reported that the last legislature had made an appropriation for a visitors' house that had since been erected on plans devised by the president of the Board of Health. It contained two dormitories of six beds each, one for women and one for men, with separate la'nais, dining rooms, and cooking facilities, and a divided compound. The sexes were separated because often persons that * were not acquaintances would have to be accommodated at the same time. In the reception rooms, visitors and patients were separated by plate 35.

The building was considered to be very attractive. A corral surrounding the building on three sides was relocated and rebuilt. 39 Relatives and friends (with permits) were allowed to remain from one steamer day to the next steamer day and could see and talk with friends separated by the large plate glass windows or the double fence corral. The visitors' house was intended to fill a substantial need in the settlement, but due to the miserable steamer service provided to the settlement, only a few persons were able to take advantage of the opportunity to see their friends. Most of the visitors were poor people and could not afford the steamer fare and living expenses for thirteen days, which was the length of time it took to make the round trip--five days on the steamer and eight days inside the visitors' house and corral. 6. Poi House and Factory a. House at Kalawao Work on a poi house at Kalawao started in early August 1901 and finished up near the end of the month. Waiamau reported that the steam cooking of in the poi house was a huge success. Up to three hundred rations could be cooked at one time. The taro produced from Waikolu and Waihanau valleys was found to be excellent cooked this way. b. Steam Factory at Kalaupapa The 1905 legislature passed an appropriation for the erection of a poi factory and for the purchase of machinery for making poi. A plant similar to the one used at the Kalihi & factory in Honolulu was purchased. The purpose of the factory was to make it unnecessary for the inmates to pound the taro or @ 'ai for @. - By June 1906 lumber and machinery were on hand for the beginning of construction on 39.

The buildings were to be simple in design but 0 painted with pleasing color contrasts. The factory was put in operation about July 18, 1907. The president of the Board of Health reported that he knew of nothing that had been built before that had given greater satisfaction to the people than the poi factory. The only sour note was that the structure cost a little over $1,800 in excess of the estimated sum. 40 In 1914/15 a fifty-horsepower Gorham gas engine was purchased to operate the poi factory and ice plant, and the old steam plant was put in reserve. 7. Wood Sawing Plant and Splitting Yard In June 1906 plans were being made for adding a wood sawing plant beyond the & factory and laundry buildings. The providing of these three services was perceived as a great boon by the residents, saving them much physical labor in connection with food preparation, clothing care, and fuel acquisition. In fiscal year 1906/07 a petition was presented to legislative visitors asking for an appropriation to purchase machinery for cutting and splitting firewood. This was one of the greatest hardships that people with crippled hands who were unable to handle an ax had to deal with. Despite agreement by the members, no money for that purpose was granted. 41 However, out of its regular appropriation for the \"Segregation and Care of Lepers,\" the settlement was able to buy one six-horsepower gasoline engine, two crosscut saws, benches, and two splitting machines. Work was to commence on August 15 on a corrugated iron building. 42 40.

Physicians' Houses During the 1901/02 period, a cottage for the resident physician was erected. An addition was made during fiscal year 1905/06. In this latter period a six-room residence was also built for the assistant physician, Dr. Hollmann. 43 In fiscal year 1911/12, a two-room addition, with bath and toilet, was made to the doctor's residence. 44 On July 5, 1929, the resident physician's dwelling was partially destroyed by fire. Reconstruction was completed in November and a corrugated iron roof added. 9. Dispensary In 1905/06 a new four-room general dispensary was being erected for the use of the medical and surgical department, even larger and more convenient than first planned. It 1906.

The stand was completed in May, a fence built around it, and trees and flowers planted. 45 43.

Steam Laundry The new laundry building was mentioned earlier as being connected with the poi factory. The laundry was of sufficient capacity to do all the settlement washing and coarse ironing. A disinfecting system was part of the process. During fiscal year 1906/07 all of the machinery for the laundry was purchased and delivered. A suitable building was erected to house the machinery, and the laundry commenced work in mid-July. 46 12. Children's Nursery Improvements projected for the 1907-09 period, despite the lack of appropriations from the 1907 legislature, included a children's nursery and nurse's cottage. The nursery would accommodate twenty-four babies and children who would be taken from their parents immediately after birth in order to reduce the danger of their becoming infected. For years the female children of leprous parents had been removed from the settlement at the earliest possible moment and were either given to relatives to care for or placed in the Kapiolani Girls' Home, the institution that had been provided by the kingdom for the sole purpose of caring for such children. A similar structure had never been provided for male children, and so only those boys that had friends outside the settlement willing to care for them had been removed. (Money for a home for non-leprous boys was finally appropriated in 1908. j The perceived necessity of removing babies from their parents at the earliest possible moment was the impetus behind the nursery construction. There they would be cared for by nurses and raised on milk and baby foods. The handsome nursery building, located at Puahi at the base of the pali, was finished by June 1908. Three or four milch cows were set aside for the sole use of its children. The Kalaupapa nursery, located in the new hospital compound, opened September 17, 1908. It was ordered that all nonleprous children under one year of age in the settlement and all children hereafter born be removed to the new 46. Report g the President of the Board of Health . . . for the Twelve Months Ending June E, 320 nursery. The situation was delicate, for while some parents favored this action, the removal of their children was strongly resented by others. The babies were kept in the nursery for a year. If after that time they showed no signs of the disease, they were removed to Honolulu and placed in the homes, where they were educated and otherwise cared for. A visitors' room was built at the nursery where one or two cribs were placed against a glass partition. There parents, with a permit from the superintendent, could visit their children on Wednesdays and Sundays of each week. 47 In 1911/12 a twenty-four-foot-square playroom was added to the nursery; the building had electric lights by 1923. 13. Houses Because of the difficulties in procuring supplies, and also as a way of reducing expenses, materials from demolished buildings were often reused. Many of the buildings at Kalaupapa were constructed from earlier buildings on the peninsula for which there was no longer any use or from materials from demolished buildings owned by the Board of Health in Honolulu. In 1901/02, for instance, the old Goto hospital at Kalawao was brought to Kalaupapa in sections and from it two good buildings housing nine people were fashioned. 48 During the latter half of 1904, seven new houses were erected, five of which were built from material received from the Kalihi detention camp. 49 Housing construction during this early period included eight new four-room cottages during 1905/06 and some twelve new cottages during 1906/07, constructed of higher class material and finish than before. The three most recent ones were said 47. th Report of e President of -- Months Ended June 30, 1909, E -- - the Board of Health . . . for the Twelve --- -- 191. 48.

In fiscal year 1922/23, three four-room cottages were built. In 1924/25 two new four-room cottages, with bathtubs, toi lets, and other amenities, were erected and said to be a great improvement over any houses built up to that time. 14. Medical Buildings Legislators investigating conditions on Moloka'i in 'I901 had nothing encouraging to say about the hospital. They noted its walls of rough-painted boards, its poor ventilation, and its lack of furniture. The \"hotel\" adjoining the hospital, intended as an auxiliary structure, was in better condition. It consisted of eighteen rooms opening on a lanai running around the building. 51 Several buildings for the better care and treatment of the sick were proposed for the 1907-09 period. In 1906/07 a new corrugated iron building was erected for the medical department to be used in the manufacture of Dr. W. J. Goodhue's bath medicine. 52 At this time there were no hospitals at Kalaupapa except for the sick wards at the various homes. Therefore, it was proposed to erect a general hospital containing completely modern equipment. Also proposed was a contagious ward to accommodate people with special diseases other than leprosy, such as pulmonary tuberculosis. Work on this structure was to start early in 1907. Each patient and the nurses would be isolated. The contagious 50.

The eucalyptus compound prepared by Dr. Goodhue, used as a bath preparation, had entirely superseded the demand for the more expensive Goto remedies. Patients using the treatment faithfully seemed to show decided improvements. For that reason, arrangements were made to facilitate the manufacture of the preparation and thus enable evervone to have a ful! supply. Report of the P' resident of the Board of Health ------ . . -- for the Six Months Ending December 3lst, 1906, p. 105. --- -- 326 ward was finished during fiscal year 1907/08. It had six rooms and was designed so that each room could be readily disinfected and cleaned without disturbing patients in any of the other rooms. The building was paid for out of the appropriation for the \"Segregation and Care of Lepers. ,153 Another necessary structure was a small building for the insane, which, because of the presence of several patients diagnosed as \"mildly insane,\" was considered imperative. At the same time, while the various homes were provided with facilities for medicated baths, those living in individual homes had none. Now a new special bathhouse was being erected for them. 54 The house was to be of smooth concrete, well drained, and have sixteen porcelain bath tubs. Lounging rooms were provided where patients could rest after their baths and gradually regain their normal body temperature, thereby avoiding colds and chills. The sexes were segregated within the house. The bathhouse was completed by June 1908. The Board of Health asked the 1907 legislative session for an appropriation of $8,000 to construct a general hospital where patients living outside of homes could get proper treatment and care. For some reason, though the governor and every senator and representative seemed in favor of the project, during the third reading of the appropriation bill that particlar item was not inserted and therefore the money was never granted. Because material was on hand for the construction, Lucius E. Pinkham, president of the Board of Health, realizing the immediate necessity for this facility, ordered work to commence. 55 53. Report of the President of the Board of Health . . . for the Twelve Months ---- -- Ended June 30, 1908, --- p. 122. 54. For the Homes and the Kalaupapa bathhouse, a large bag containing from fifty to seventy-five pounds of the bath preparation was placed in a specially-built 500-gallon steam-tight tank. The steam was turned on until all the ingredients had been extracted, leaving a concentrated decoction , enough cold water having been placed in the tank at the start to condense the steam. The concentrated decoction was then run into the individual bath tubs and enough hot water added to dilute to the required strength for bathing.

Baker, Bishop Museum, Honolulu. The new hospital, almost finished by the end of June 1908, was located in the portion of the settlement called Puahi, on the south side of town and toward the pali. The building stretched 180 feet in an east-west direction, with a wing on the west end extending north. It consisted of four private wards and two large general wards. It also contained a sky-lighted operating room, a drug room, nurses' quarters, male and female dressing rooms, a dining room, and a kitchen. 56 The new nursery was a few hundred feet northeast of the hospital. 15. St. Francis Church As mentioned in a previous section, Father Damien had not worked alone at the settlement. Father Andre/ Burgermann began assisting occasionally beginning in 1874, moving to Kalaupapa early in 1878 where he remained until July 1880. Father Albert Montiton arrived at the settlement in September 1881 and remained until March 1885. Damien's immediate successor at the settlement was Father Wendelin Robert Moellers, a German priest who arrived almost five months before Damien's death and remained until 1902. He found Father Lambert Conrardy, the Belgian diocesan priest, assisting the ailing Damien at Kalawao. Father Wendelin made the church at Kalaupapa, flanked by a priest's cottage, his headquarters. The interior decorations of the chapel had been Father Albert's work and were described by Charles Warren Stoddard in 1884: \"His church is like a little Chinese showbox full of color; odd combinations of color and grotesque but pretty patterns upon wall and ceiling. . . . 57 Stoddard further remarked that the walls and ceiling are decorated with gaudy paintings; Father Albert whispered quietly in my ear: You see, all this is somewhat barbarous, but there was for me less question of satisfying the exigencies of artistic taste, than to give pleasure to these poor people; what you see here, that's&st what they like. The altar and its many little statues. . . . 56. Report of the President c the Board of Health . . . for the Twelve Months Ended June 30, 1909, p. 199. -- - 57. Diary of a Visit to Molokai, p. 22. ---- 58. \"Illustrations,\" Damien Institute, I, no. 4 (May 1895):73. See Illustration 16. 334 - This little church, Our Lady Health of the Sick, soon became much too small for the crowds that packed in for Mass and evening devotions. For several years after his arrival, Father Wendelin raised funds however he could, and finally, with the help of the Honolulu Catholic Mission, he began work on a new church in 1897. The wooden structure on the edge of the village was completed in 1899, blessed, and dedicated in 1900 to St. Francis of Assisi. It had twin towers and the frontal view of three large entrance doors and slender windows made it resemble a medieval cathedral. The old church was moved to one side and used as a social hall. The beautiful church was a great joy to the devout Kalaupapa congregation. One can imagine, therefore, the tragedy of the accidental burning of the structure August 12, 1906. The fire started when an altar boy, in replacing a tenser after Benediction, spilled some charcoal on the floor. Thinking the coals to be dead, he did not pick them up. After smoldering for a while, the coals scattered over the floor flared up, and many fine vestments, statues, and various other church articles were lost in the blaze. The structure burned to the ground in thirty-five minutes; nothing was saved but the tabernacle. The house of Father Maxime And& (who replaced Father Wendelin) and the store, warehouse, and other Board of Health buildings caught fire several times, but were not seriously damaged due to the noble fire-fighting efforts of the residents. The front of the old church, standing near the newer one, was burned out, but was then repaired and the interior made usable for the time being again as a church. 59 59. \"Burning of St. Francis Church, Kalaupapa, Molokai,\" The Damien Institute Monthly Magazine 12, no. 11 ( November 1906): 174-76; Fire was a great fear at the settlement, and after several had occurred in August, night watchmen were appointed with strict orders on what to do if fire was discovered. Although petitions had been circulated to have fire hydrants and other fire-protection apparatus installed, no appropriations for them had been forthcoming. the Board of Health Report of the President @ p. 138. for the Twelve Months Ending June 30th, 1907, -----**-- 335 Illustration 72.

Two of the contributors were 0 Pope Pius X and King Edward VI I of Great Britain. According to tradition, two French priests at the settlement, with building experience, drew up plans for the new church. Father Andre/ recorded on October 15, 1907, that fifteen Japanese masons and carpenters, headed by a Hawaiian construction engineer, began work on the new structure under the supervision of Father Maxime. Work proceeded quickly, and the new Gothic-style stone church of St. Francis was completed in May 1908 and blessed on the twenty-sixth of that month. Enough money had been collected to acquire new church furnishings also, such as an altar, chandelier, monstrance, vestments, statues, a tower bel I, and two stained-glass windows for the sanctuary. A special donation was a bronze statue of the Sacred Heart of Jesus that was placed outside in front of the main entrance. 60 16. Miscellaneous Structures In fiscal year 1905/06 several new structures were seen as being essential for the settlement's many activities and personnel. Among these were : a. New stables These were built on Staff Row by June 30, 1906, along with a carriage house, to accommodate the animals belonging to the board, the superintendent, and doctors. The stables were remodeled in 1919/20. b. Oi I Storage A new, completely isolated iron warehouse for oil storage was constructed far enough away from other buildings that all danger of fire was removed. 60.

New Warehouses Warehouse space was provided by moving the old visitors' house near the landing into line with the Kalaupapa store and partly rebuilding it. The remaining good warehouse at the landing was to be similarly removed and repaired. 61 d. Landing In the latter half of 1906, one hundred and fifty feet of solid masonry stone wall was built on both sides of the landing. Filling and grading was also accomplished, as well as laying of steel tracks to the warehouses. 62 By fiscal year 1906/07, most of the lumber was on hand for erection of an attractive pavilion at the landing. It would usually be open, except on the windward side, and arranged so that by closing the shutters it could be turned into an assembly hall measuring twenty-eight by eighty feet. 63 By the next year all the old unsightly buildings at the landing had been torn down, the grade raised four feet, and concrete steps put in leading from the wharf to the landing. Two new warehouses had been built in a line with the store, facing the street, and the railroad track mentioned earlier was in use leading from the landing to the new warehouses. It was then planned to run a track from the landing to the @ factory. The Superintendent of Public Works had had a new derrick erected and the steam hoisting engine purchased by Mr. Pease, in charge of construction of the federal leprosarium, had been installed at the landing. 64 In 1914/15 this old hoisting engine was replaced by a new double-drum hoist. 61. th Report g e President of the Board of Health . . . for the Year Endinq June 30,-e, p. 92. - - p - --- 62. th Report of e President of the Board of Health . . . for the Six Months Ending December x, -EK -;-Report of the President3 the Board of Health . . . ---- for the Twelve Months Ending June e, -- 1907, p. 13. 63.

Slaughterhouse In fiscal year 1910/11 a slaughter and hide house was built with concrete floors and side walls. 66 The hides of the slaughtered cattle were salted to preserve them until they could be tanned. The sales money from the hides was put into the territorial treasury. A supply storeroom was added in fiscal year 1925/26. 4. -- Ice Plant In fiscal year 1912/13, a Baker six-ton ice-making and refrigerating machine was delivered and construction on the ice plant begun. 67 h. Outbuildings and Miscellaneous During fiscal year 1910/11, eighteen new cookhouses, each eight by twenty feet, and three cookhouses of eight by ten feet were built. The next year twelve new kitchens and thirty-eight outbuildings were constructed for the use of people outside the homes. Six new concrete watering troughs were also added. In 1912/13 nine kitchens and sixteen outhouses were built, and in 1914/15 twelve new kitchens, nine outhouses, and a new four-room cottage for a blacksmith were erected. During 1919/20, five new kitchens and dining rooms outside the homes were completed. Three buildings for housing the Delco plant were built in fiscal year 1922/23. In August 1929 a fifty-horsepower diesel engine driving a thirty-five-kilowatt generator 65. Ibid., p. 123. 66.

Stores By the summer of 1901, at least one private store was in business at Kalaupapa. It was owned by J. D. Kahale, who had an agent buying goods for him in Honolulu. 69 Soon thereafter, other businesses began operating: Robert Holt and James Prosser (an employee of the Board of Health) started a dry goods and grocery store at Kalawao in 1902; A. Galaspo was given permission to erect a bakery at Kalawao in 1904; and a fish market at Kalaupapa was opened in the spring of 1904. 70 17. Agricultural Activities and Livestock a. Dairy, Hog Ranch In the early 1900s a great deal of cultivation was undertaken. In 1903 crops included sorghum, ,alfalfa, and other stock fodder. In early 1903 six acres of land in one of the sheltered valleys had been cleared for the planting of 4,000 papaya trees. Two acres of pumpkins were also planted. Both fruits were good hog feed when combined with cooked offal from the slaughterhouse. Some new construction was done at this time in connection with the dairy, now an established part of the ranching operations, and the hog pens. As 68.

Efforts to control the growth by hand seemed to accomplish little. In 1904 some \"seed blight\" was secured that helped prevent further spreading. 'I Leaf bugs\" brought in from O'ahu also helped clear up several thousand acres. 72 The dairy operation received careful attention. Any patient on order from the resident physician could receive one quart or more of milk daily, delivered free to his house by a milk wagon. (The distribution of fresh milk each morning to the fever cases and other debilitated patients was considered to be of therapeutic value. A milk diet seemed to help reduce fevers and other ailments. ) The papaya fruit was the major hog food for the settlement. The plantation at Puahi provided up to four dray loads of 0 this commodity weekly during the summer months. In 1904 a small supply of panicum grass was received from the Moloka'i Cattle Ranch, which was planted and seemed to grow well. It required much less water than the sorghum and was said to be fine animal fodder. Ultimately both sorghum and panicum were fed daily to the milch cows and calves. In May 1906 hog cholera hit the settlement's hog industry, killing a large number of animals before the disease disappeared. The old pens were afterwards thoroughly sprayed and disinfected, some buildings enlarged, and concrete floors and troughs installed. 71.

The drought continued into 1909, the lack of rain and feed causing a loss of more than three hundred head. The milk supply dropped from sixty-two to fourteen gallons daily. The dairy was subsequently closed and all the stock driven into Waikolu and Wai'ale'ia valleys. Because the cessation of the milk ration was working a great hardship on many people who had become dependent on it, the Board of Health allowed condensed milk and fresh bread to be issued in lieu of fresh milk. 73 In the 1913/14 fiscal year, three hundred coconut trees donated by the Board of Health were planted by the residents. During 1922/23, a milking shed was built near the baseball grounds and five hundred redwood posts and galvanized wire fencing were bought to be used in the Makanalua district for cattle paddocks for the board's cattle herd. b. Taro Industry By the summer of 1901, work on the Puahi taro patches was progressing, as was the laying of a four-inch water pipe to them.74 In 1904 taro was being planted in Waikolu Valley and at Puahi. The taro crops from Puahi were excellent, and the residents were very anxious to receive their ration from that area. There were about five more acres there that could not be planted because efficient labor could not be hired at reasonable wages. The board requested , therefore, that permission be given to allow a company of patients to take over all the taro lands, the board to receive one-fourth of the crop and the balance to be purchased by the board at market prices. 75 73.

Photos courtesy of Kalaupapa Historical Society, Kalaupapa. 360 By early 1905 a contract had been entered into with the \"Hui Hooikaika Kino\" to cultivate all the available taro land in Puahi. One-third of the crop was to be the sole property of the board, the balance to be purchased from the hui at current market rates. Planting at Waikolu would be carried on as usual, no hui being willing to take over those lands. 76 By 1906 some of the settlement residents were allowed one or more acres of land and were engaged in planting taro for the board. As a rule, the residents did not like to engage in taro cultivation because laboring in water was detrimental to their physical well-being. Because the federal leprosarium was going to be located at the entrance to Waikolu Valley, it was suggested that the board purchase the improvements made there by the settlement planters and then enter into an agreement with outside parties, who would not be allowed to enter the settlement, to cultivate those lands. 77 A better quality of was sought by purchasing a quantity of hulis (taro tops) from planters at Pelekunu and HZlawa. In addition to the scarcity of water during the drought that began in 1906, the greatest difficulty in taro cultivation remained finding labor. The residents simply could not work steadily in water and not enough kzkuas were available. For the next couple of years the lack of water made it impossible to cultivate half of the available taro land in Puahi. Because the residents were unwilling to cu I tivate Wai kolu Valley, the superintendent again urged in a hui of Hawai'ians or Chinese 1908 that the taro land there be leased to to work for the board. 76.

Water Supply In fiscal year 7903/04 a new 10,000-gallon water tank was erected at Ma kanalua . On the side of the pali about four miles from Kalawao was a small concrete reservoir that caught water from two or three smal I streams. An eight-inch pipe led from it into the valley. During July to December 1904, several severe breaks in the eight-inch pipeline occurred as rocks fell from the cliffs between Waikolu and Kalawao. If money could be obtained, it was suggested that a deeper trench be dug in which to bury the pipe. A small appropriation was then requested to extend the pipeline farther up Waikolu Valley to get an increased supply of water. An appropriation for this purpose was made by the 1905 legislature, and in 1906 a Department of Public Works engineer was sent to the settlement to prepare plans and estimates for increasing the water supply. Such an action was greatly needed for irrigation, fire protection, and power purposes. An appropriation of $12,000 was granted by the 1907 legislature to install new pipeline and place hydrants. Pipe and other material was purchased and taken to Waikolu Valley preparatory to laying. The project then ran out of money and work had to be discontinued. Negotiations then got underway to have the Marine-Hospital Service advance the amount needed to finish laying the pipe, and, in return, the federal station would acquire a perpetual right to 200,000 gallons daily. An agreement was reached and as mentioned in the section on the federal leprosarium, eight-inch pipes were laid up to the head of Wai kolu Valley. A supply of water large enough to meet any demand in the immediate future was thus obtained by 1909. In 1911/12 it was noted that there was a scarcity of water due to absorption in the ditch connecting the springs with the pipeline. A flume was needed to replace the ditch. The next fiscal year, 1912/13, 1,900 feet of a fourteen-by-twenty-inch flume was built leading from the upper end of 363 the eight-inch pipeline toward the water Evidently the flume was later increased in hundred feet were rebuilt in 1928/29. 19. Roads, Trails, Bridges In 1901 the residents of the settlement complained that the head from Waikolu Valley. 78 length, because twenty-eight road running through the settlement to Waikolu had been enclosed by a fence, and gates had been put on both ends. Cattle were brought in and penned there during the night, but they tended to jump out on the mauka side and destroy and/or eat the plants (cane and other crops) cultivated by the residents. They therefore petitioned that the practice of putting the cattle in there at night be stopped. 79 During 1905/06 roads in the settlement received needed repairs . The road from Baldwin Home to the Board of Health store at Kalawao was rebuilt and widened. The pali road also was repaired so that the mailman could get up and down more easily. The former mailman had quit in January when, after making semi-weekly trips for years, he lost his mule and almost his own life on the trail. 80 The mail carrier now made four trips weekly. A heavy storm washed away the trail in many places, forcing the mailman to carry a two-by-four piece of lumber to use as a bridge to crawl over the washouts. The trail was being widened to six feet in 1906/07. A widened trail also made it easier for the Molokai Ranch to drive beef cattle to the settlement when needed. 81 78.

Several new turns were added, giving the cowboys more protection when driving cattle and also reducing loss of the cattle themselves. 20. Kalaupapa Social Hall (Paschoal Hall) A social hall was erected at Kalaupapa during fiscal year 1915/16. The structure, measuring one hundred ten by forty feet, was set upon one hundred twenty-four concrete piers. A space thirty-five by forty feet was to be used as the social hall, and a twelve by twenty-foot stage would have a movie curtain and be used for amateur theatricals. Seating capacity was for three hundred fifty persons. 82 A moving picture machine had been purchased for the settlement in 1908/09. R. K. Bonine of Honolulu and the Advertiser, Bulletin, and Star newspapers had assisted in procuring funds for the movie outfit. In 1913/14 it was noted that a new moving picture machine had been purchased, and in 1916 a visitor mentioned that the movie apparatus in the \"theater\" had been installed by Bonine for the government. The theater consisted of a plaster screen in the open, fronting a score of rough benches, lightly roofed over. Films were shown twice a week. 83 c. Summary of Business and Social Activities During this 1900 to 1929 period, both the Board of Health and the settlement residents were involved in a number of activities. Individual residents and various clubs carried on a variety of business enterprises, from catching fish that were purchased by the superintendent for consumption by the residents, allowing an alternative 82.

Employment at fair wages was offered to all residents able and willing to work, though no one was forced to labor. Six churches--two Protestant, two Catholic, and two Latter-Day Saints--and a Young Men's Christian Association afforded religious privileges. As more residents moved to Kalaupapa, the last regular service at Siloama was held about 1927, and the little church was virtually abandoned until 1938. For about thirty years this branch chapel at Kalaupapa, the New Siloama or Kanaana Church, as it was often called after 1890, stood on the site of the present Calvinist parsonage. Prior to 1901, its bell had been destroyed, and around 1903 or 1904 the steeple was ripped off in a windstorm. By 1914 it was decided that the time had come to build a new church, and in 1915 the present building was erected by Sam Kaaumoana of Kaumakapili Church in Honolulu, who brought carpenters and painters with him. It was called Kanaana Hou, New Canaan, \"The Church of the Promised Land. 'I Various amusement places existed in the form of several assembly halls, a bandstand, a race track, a baseball field, and shooting ranges. Athletic clubs and debating societies had also been formed. Two small brass bands and glee clubs furnished music. D. Moloka'i Lighthouse The first lighthouse in Hawai'i was established in 1859 at Kawaihae on the island of Hawai'i to guide oil-laden whaling vessels into port. Following the annexation of Hawai'i to the United States, the Lighthouse Board was directed on December 29, 1903, to take charge of the Hawai'ian lighthouse service. The Department of Commerce and Labor, through the Lighthouse Board, was charged with all the administrative duties relative thereto. The territory was first made a portion of the Twelfth lighthouse district, headquartered in San Francisco, California. Because of the problem of maintaining communications between California and Hawai'i, the Lighthouse Board recommended in 1905 that a Nineteenth lighthouse district be established, 372 which ultimately embraced the Hawai'ian islands, the Midway Islands, the island of Guam, and the American Samoan Islands, with headquarters in Honolulu. After 1904, the federal government poured millions into the lighthouse facilities in Hawai'i. From 1904 to 1910, the district was run by both the army and navy. An army officer acting as district engineer had charge of the construction of lighthouses and the placing of the lights. When completed, the lighthouses were turned over to the navy and a naval officer directed their operation and maintenance. On July 1, 1910, the U.S. Lighthouse Board, established in 1852 and consisting of officers of the army and navy and civilians, was terminated and the Bureau of Lighthouses established. 84 On July 1, 1939, the Lighthouse Service was transferred from the Department of Commerce to the Coast Guard of the Treasury Department. An act of March 4, 1907, appropriated $60,000 for the establishment of a light and fog signal on the north shore of Moloka'i, and an area of 21.6 acres was reserved thereon for the station by executive order of October 27, 1908. Plans were prepared for a reenforced concrete tower and for three concrete dwellings with oil house. In September 1907 it was decided to use at this station the first-order cylindrical helical-bar lantern and the lens ordered for the Makapu'u Point light station on O'ahu. The lantern was completed and shipped in March 1908. The lens consisted of a second-order 180-degree two-panel lens, arranged to show a flashing white light every twenty seconds, mounted on a mercury float, and driven by the usual clockwork and falling weight. The lens arrived at New York in July and was shipped to Honolulu in November 1908. The tower was octagonal in plan, 20 feet inscribed diameter at the base and 14 feet 4 inches at the top, resting upon an octagonal reenforced 84. W.K.

It was provided at the top with a molded concrete cornice, supporting the lantern. The stairs up to and including the fourth landing were of concrete and from there to the lantern floor were of cast iron. The watch-room floor supporting the lens pedestal was also of cast iron, with steel I -beam below. From this floor to the third floor below a hollow weight shaft extended for the clock. The air lock was in the main stairs just below the service room or fourth floor. The focal plane of the light was 120 feet above the base of the tower and 213 feet above high water. The illuminant was incandescent oil vapor in a 55-millimeter Welsbach mantel, and the geographical range of the light was 21 miles. The three concrete dwellings were alike, I$-stories high, with two bedrooms, living room, dining room, bathroom, storeroom, and kitchen on the main floor and an attic above. A wide verandah ran around the front, one side, and part of the rear of each house, and was covered with a roof supported on nine concrete columns. The roofs were frame, covered with corrugated-iron sheathing. The concrete work on the tower began in September 1908 and was completed in March 1909. The ironwork of the upper floors, stairs, and lantern was erected in April, and the illuminating apparatus was in place early in June. The station was to go into commission early in fiscal year 1910.85 During fiscal year 1909 several new lights were put into commission. First in importance was the large hyper-radiant light at Makapu'u Point on O'ahu, the landfill light for vessels bound from the states to the Hawai'ian Islands. Next in importance and power was the Moloka'i light. In 1915 the Moloka'i light was noted as having 620,000 candlepower (English candles). The Moloka'i light, in conjunction with the Makapu'u Point light, guided westbound vessels, particularly from southern California, Panama, and South American ports, into Kaiwi Channel, the approach to Honolulu. Keepers from the federal lighthouse service tended 85. Annual Report of the Light-House Board to the Secretary of Commerce and Labor, June 30, -- p.28.

There was no standard type or design of lighthouse keeper's dwelling, because of the many different local conditions that had to be met at each site, including climate and the availability of materials. Attempts were made to tailor the buildings to prevailing local styles and customs and to harmonize them architecturally as much as possible with the light station and its surroundings. At more important lights, the tower was detached from the dwelling and was usually of fireproof construction, as was the one on Moloka'i. Older towers of this type were built of brick or stone masonry, with stairways, lantern, and other appurtenances of cast iron. Later towers had a structural open framework of wrought iron or steel, usually with an enclosed stairwell in the center. Even later ones had reinforced concrete towers, which were expected to be more extensively used in the future. Completely equipped light stations on land usually consisted of the light tower, an oil house, a fog-signal building, the keepers' dwellings, a workshop, water supply and drainage systems, a landing wharf, a boathouse, a barn and other outbuildings, plus roads, walks, and fences. Because of the restricted area of some light sites, several of these purposes might be served by a single building. 86 The keepers at Moloka'i lived under rigid restrictions because of their proximity to Kalaupapa settlement. They were not permitted to associate with the patients or even with paroled patients. As compensation for these restrictions, they were given privileges not enjoyed by other stations: visitors (except patients) could come to their home at any time, they were given a full month's leave every year on full pay, they were the highest paid keepers in the district, and homes were provided for the three keepers and their families. One of the keepers in 86. Department of Commerce, Lighthouse Service, The United States Lighthouse Service ' 1916), pp. 19, 78. 1915 (Washington: Government Printing OK 378 April 1925 had a homestead near Kaunakakai on the other side of the island, where his wife moved each year so their children could attend school. The steep pali trail was used frequently by the keepers on their way to the outside world. Supplies for the lighthouse that were landed on the Kalaupapa wharf were double packed to prevent contamination. The outside covering was burned upon transfer of the materials and foodstuffs inside the reservation. In addition to the principal station near Kalaupapa, there was a light at La'au Point and two range lights - elsewhere. 87 By the late 193Os, the only Hawai'ian lighthouse equipment still in use that had been in existence prior to 1910 were the tower, lens, and dwellings at the Moloka'i and Makapu'u light stations. In 1933 the Moloka'i lens was again listed as 620,000 candlepower--a second order lens with an incandescent oil-vapor lamp, the type generally employed for important lights. A newspaper article during that time noted that Life occasionally does a few handsprings for these men [light keepers]. , . . Familiar is the story of the keeper of the Molokai beacon at Kalaupapa, who was busy cleaning his lenses when an earthquake hit the island. As the tremors increased, the spindly tower tipped so violently that the mercury spilt out of the vats carrying the revolving light. Unable to turn in a dry socket, the huge lens was temporarily replaced by an emergency light. This Molokai light, incidentally, throws out a 2,500,OOO candlepower gleam, 8$e highest intensity of any marine light on the Pacific coast. Earthquakes presented a definite hazard to the huge Moloka'i light. In addition to one on December 25, 1925, that scattered mercury from the vat, on January 22, 1938, forty-three pounds of mercury spilled 87.

The keeper and his assistants poured some spare mercury into the vat until the lens was in motion, having stopped for only fifteen minutes. No other damage was done except for the loss of five feet of stone wall that was shaken loose. 89 In 1939 the Moloka'i light was described as being 2,500,OOO candlepower. In 1948 a newspaper article was written on Fred E. Robins, who had been in charge of the light since 1939. It mentioned that Robins worked in close cooperation with the Kalaupapa authorities and was a member of Damien Post No. 30, the American Legion, and the Lions Club.\" In 1966 the Moloka' i Light Station, tended by keepers since 1909, was automated. The two Coast Guardsmen stationed there were transferred. The light would now turn itself on in the evening and off in the morning. The Coast Guard periodically travels from Honolulu by helicopter to service the light. 89. Albright, \"Sentinels of the Sea Lanes,\" August 14, 1938. 90. Fog r \"Fred E.

Creation of Board of Hospitals and Settlement BY 1929 conditions at Kalaupapa were sti I I considered unsatisfactory. Governor Lawrence M. Judd of the Territory of Hawaii appointed an Advisory Commission on Leprosy to investigate the situation, study the status of the leprosy control program in Hawaii, and make suggestions for improvement. The resulting report made several specific recommendations : (1) establishment of a hospital for the treatment of leprosy patients in or near a medical center; (2) no more compulsory segregation of patients at Kalaupapa (the effect of banning punitive segregation was to eliminate the stigma of the settlement as a penal institution); (3) more research on susceptibility to the disease; and most important, (4) development of a program of social welfare, that would increase the happiness of the patients and their families. The commission also offered a plan for the reorganization of leprosy affairs under the territorial government. Responsibility for the public health program for leprosy had rested with the Board of Health from 1865 to 1931. As a result of the Judd Commission findings that there was dissatisfaction with and misunderstanding of the administration of the leprosy program, the 1931 legislature created a separate Board of Leper Hospitals and Settlement to function as a policy-making agency and established the position of General Superintendent as its administrative official. (The legislature transferred the program back to the Board of Health in 1949.) The Board of Hospitals and Settlement, as it was later called, which administered the territory's leprosy program from 1931 to 1949, was a group of five citizens serving without pay, at least two of whom had to be doctors. They appointed their executive officer, referred to as the 1. \"This is Kalaupapa,\" ca. 1950, V.A. 9, Kalaupapa, History and Description, p. 4. M-420 (Judd Collection), Hawaii State Archives, Honolulu, 383 superintendent. This position was held by Harry A. Kluegel. The administration of the settlement was handled independently by the resident superintendent. The new board established specific policies regarding the leprosy program, and the necessary legislation was pushed through in a strongly worded resolution presented by the Public Health Committee of the Senate. The members of the 1931 legislature were told by Governor Judd that conditions at the leprosy settlement were deplorable and needed immediate attention and correction. Judd requested that a substantial amount of government money be earmarked for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, and development of both Kalihi Receiving Station and Kalaupapa Settlement. In May 1931 Senate Bill No. 70 was passed--\"An Act to Provide for the Reorganization of the Territorial System for the Care and Treatment of Leprosy, the Rehabilitation and/or Expansion of the Leper Settlement at Kalaupapa and the Receiving Hospital . . . \"--to take effect July 1, 1931. The territory was duly authorized, under the direction of the Board of Hospitals and Settlement, to prepare plans and specifications for a program of construction for the rehabilitation and improvement of the leprosy settlement at Kalaupapa and the Kalihi Receiving Station on O'ahu. The Superintendent of Public Works was charged with the preparation of plans and specifications and the conducting of contracts for the building projects under the rehabilitation program at Kalaupapa. The Senate Committee on Health recommended that $400,000 be supplied in the 1931 biennium and $200,000 more be expended the following year. The first few years of this period in settlement history were dominated by the board's program of construction and improvement. Most of the buildings at Kalaupapa today are a result of this rehabilitation program. Major revitalization continued through 1938, providing more amenities and facilities than at any other time to date. 384 1 B. Rehabilitation Begins 1. Water and Power Distribution Systems By the end of June 1930, plans and specifications had been prepared and a contract awarded for additions to the power plant, water system, and power distribution system at the settlement. Work involved making an addition twenty feet long and twelve feet wide to the power plant, installing an additional generating unit, and making some additions to the water and power distribution systems. By 1932 improvements had been made in terms of street lighting and installation of fire hydrants. In April 1932 the \"split phase, transformer\" system of electrical distribution throughout the leprosarium was supplanted by the \"four-wire\" method of distributing light and power current. This new method, recommended by the engineering staff of the Hawaiian Electric Company, resulted in better service. On May 15, 1932, the Kalaupapa power plant began operating on a twenty-four-hour basis, supplying current for lighting and electrically-operated radio sets at all times as a comfort and convenience to patients and staff. 2 On September 30, 1933, service was accepted from the Moloka'i Electric Company. Under this contract, using the company's generating plant at Kaunakakai and transmitting the power to Kalaupapa substation, the local power house was used for standby service. Distribution lines had been extended from the power house and the electric shop set up in the shops building with tools and equipment for maintenance of the system and of the electrical apparatus in service throughout the settlement. 3 2.

These buildings were completed to replace the facilities destroyed by fire in November 1928.4 It was recommended that a recreation pavilion makai of the dining hall and between the dormitories be erected. 5 Construction at McVeigh continued into the next year. By the end of 1931 several jobs were underway. Six cottages on the north side of the home were almost finished as were eight cottages on the south side. All had stained floors, one-by-three painted battens, and concrete walks. The pavilion was partly framed, with rafters and roof sheathing in place. A heating plant with a concrete floor was also being added. 6 Reports of work completed by fiscal year 1931/32 mentioned the completed construction of fourteen frame cottages to house one, two, or three persons, neatly spaced and conveniently located near the main kitchen and dining room and equipped with hot and cold water, toilets, showers, and partially furnished; a central frame recreation pavilion; a concrete boiler house and hot water distribution buildings; and a complete system of roadways, system serving all the fences, curbing, and 4.

A small central laundry building had been authorized but not built.7 By mid-1934 a contract had been awarded for additions to cottages and garages of the McVeigh Home. Seven frame one-story, four-room cottages, for two patients each, sixteen by twenty-four feet, were constructed, and two frame open-front four-stall garages, eighteen by forty feet. Also completed were two one-story frame cottages, for five patients each, twenty-eight by thirty-two feet, and one L-shaped frame garage, forty-eight by fifty-eight feet, for seven cars.8 All cottages had baths and toilets, hot and cold water, and electric lights. The legislature of 1935 appropriated $135,000 \"for permanent improvements including new buildings, additions[ ,] repairs and improvements to buildings and grounds, furnishings and equipment, for--the settlement at Kalaupapa, the Kalihi Hospital, the Kapiolani Girls' Home and the Kalihi Boys' Home.\"' This Act 24 became effective upon its approval April IO, 1935, and work started shortly thereafter on the continuation of the Improvement Program to July 1936. At McVeigh Home a new cottage was built for non-patient cooks and one old cottage was moved and remodelled for two patients. New equipment was installed in the kitchen and a covered concrete platform was constructed at the kitchen entrance to accommodate garbage 7.

All driveways were paved and fruit and ornamental trees and shrubbery planted. 10 3. Bay View Home In describing the Bay View Home for the Aged and Blind in 1930, H.A. Kluegel noted four twelve-room dormitories, a kitchen, dining room, heating plant, laundry, manager's cottage, and chapel, all under the direct supervision of a paid manager. In 1932 the home was caring for seven women and fifty-one men. Minor improvements, repairs, and painting were done during the year and the kitchen was remodelled and new equipment added. The meat and vegetable room was completely reconstructed and new equipment installed. Provision was also made for a 'new boiler and hot water circulating system to serve the four large dormitories. In 1934 all Bay View building units were painted inside and out, the central dining room was remodelled, plumbing and wiring overhauled, and a new medical dressing station established. 11 In fiscal year 1935/36 the old Kalele residence within the compound and its outbuildings were demolished, in addition to an old Japanese store building and various pig pens and chicken coops. The old laundry building was remodelled for the private store and small barber shop moved in from another location. The manager's cottage was overhauled and painted. A new, substantial platform was built adjoining the hot water plant to facilitate the handling of oil drums, and a similar platform was constructed along one side of the kitchen for supplies and garbage can racks. Painting was done on the interior and IZinais of the dining room, and the dormitory interiors were painted. The dressing station was also remodelled and painted. The recently constructed paved driveway at Bay View was proving very useful and additional concrete walks were laid out with particular reference to the needs of the blind 10. @., p. 23. 11. Annual Report of the Superintendent, Board of Hospitals and Settlement . . . . for the F-&al Year Ending June-934, p. 2. ---- 398 patients. Along the shoreline and makai of the driveway, numerous coconut trees were planted. 12 By fiscal year 1937/38, a serving kitchen and dining room, exclusively for the blind, had been added, as well as a new garage for patients' cars. Two storerooms had been built and additions made to the four dormitories and the main kitchen. All buildings had been screened and repainted. 13 4. Bishop Home Several new construction projects were undertaken for the Bishop Home during the rehabilitation period. In November 1931 work in progress included a frame and concrete social hall, a dormitory, and a kitchen and dining room. 14 A month later a laundry and boiler room was also underway. In early 1932 Kluegel specified color selections for certain units at the settlement. The Bishop Home was to have light tan walls, gray trim, and \"dust colored\" floors. Inside, rooms were to be light gray with very light gray ceilings. 15 Reports for 1932 mentioned at the Bishop Home a new kitchen-dining room-store room unit, equipped for forty but designed for a capacity of about sixty-five; a new dormitory with nine bedrooms, lounge, etc. , with new furnishings; a new social hall; and a new laundry and drying room. 12.

Also added was a reinforced concrete and tile central heating plant and a hot water circulating and distribution system to connect all new and old buildings. All buildings were connected by concrete walks and \"telford base\" roadways with concrete curbs. A new flagstaff would be added, and improvements to the infirmary were underway. In the course of all this work, twelve buildings had been demolished and removed from the group. 16 The unit was enclosed by a new fence with attractive entrance portals in 1932. Further rehabilitation work was carried on with additional appropriations made by the 1933 legislature. Three one-story, four-room frame patient cottages with bath and toilet, hot and cold water, and electric lights were constructed in 1934. Also completed was a modern frame cottage for the sisters, measuring thirty-three feet four inches by eighty-five feet, a portion of which was two stories high. It replaced the old cottage and was built on the same spot. Plans were completed for the restoration and enlargement of the chapel that had previously adjoined the sisters' cottage. 17 During 1935/36, within the sisters' compound, the old store room cottage, chicken coops, and other small buildings were demolished, and a modern chicken unit, fernery, and tool house constructed, and the chapel screened. The side IZinai of the kitchen building was enclosed for a vegetable and fruit storeroom, and a wash rack and drain were constructed for washing @ barrels in the rear of the building; the infirmary dressing station was improved by remodelling and the addition of new equipment. Paved driveways were completed and 16.

They were connected to the street with concrete sidewalks. The construction work and painting were done by leeward Moloka'i Homestead carpenters and painters. Major repairs were performed on twenty-five residences and dormitories. Approximately twenty-four old buildings, no longer habitable, were demolished and removed. 21 In 1934 two replacement cottages for patients were constructed in the settlement in addition to the nine cottages built at McVeigh Home and the three at Bishop Home. One was a one-story frame structure with one bedroom, a kitchen, and a living room, measuring twenty-two by twenty-four feet overall, and the other was a one-story frame, twenty-six by thirty-one feet overall. 22 20.

Hospital and Mental Ward During the summer of 1930, a thirty-two bed hospital with a nursery, maternity ward, operating room, dining room, kitchen, nurses' cottage, and laundry was being built. It was suggested that a dispensary be incorporated in the new hospital and that the present dispensary site could be used for a new visitors' quarters. The present visitors' house could then be used as the general office. 23 The color scheme inside and out for the new hospital and staff cottage was to be similar to that at the infirmary at Kalihi. The hospital building opened on July 1, 1932. It was frame with mineral-surfaced shingle roofs. Dimensions of the hospital were 131 feet wide by 160 feet long, and of the, dispensary, 30 feet wide by 74 feet long. In June 1932 the hospital was described as having a normal capacity of fifty beds, divided into four separate wards. There were also offices for the doctors and nurses, operating rooms, and an x-ray room and laboratory, all fully equipped; a dining room, kitchen, and store room; and a boiler room unit, incinerator, and disinfectors. The dispensary unit for the treatment of out-patients was connected to the hospital building and contained examination and treatment rooms, a drug room, a general store room, a mortuary, and offices for the doctor, dentist, nurses, and clerk. 24 In 1935/36 a mental ward accommodating four patients and an attendant was built north of the main building, connecting thereto with 23.

A four-stall garage for staff use was provided at this time, and the sun porches and corridors were glassed in. Two platforms were built for sun exposure for patients, an open IZnai was converted to a storeroom, and other minor alternations were done. The Wilcox Memorial Building in the visitors' compound was remodelled as quarters for the hospital kitchen help and other non-inmate personnel. During this time attendance increased at the hospital, and more in the way of treatment was offered, such as infra-red lamp and ultraviolet ray treatments, massage, sun baths, hydrotherapy, and medicinal inhalations. The former morgue in the dispensary wing was converted into an additional dressing room. 25 In October 1938 the operation of the hospital was placed in charge of the Sisters of St. Francis. A different hospital system prevailed at Kalaupapa than at Kalihi and different techniques were necessary--at Kalaupapa, hospitalization and treatment were voluntary rather than compulsory. Because the majority of the residents needed hospital care, a responsibility rested upon the hospital staff to create a good understanding of and desire for the relief obtainable from hospitalization and treatment, thus resulting in more complete use of the facilities. 7. New Baldwin Home Provision in 1932 was made for the conversion of the old Kalaupapa general hospital into a home for about thirty to thirty-five patients and abandonment of the existing Baldwin Home at Kalawao. 26 This was a result not only of Dutton's death and of the general movement to Kalaupapa, but also of the fact that the old home was in such a state of disrepair that it was not economical to attempt repairs or improvements. In 1934 the was further remodelled, patients' dining room-kitchen at the new home a two-stall garage was constructed, and the 25. Annual 22-23. 26.

Plans were prepared for a small new chapel to be used jointly by the brothers and the patients. 27 In August 1935 the old Baldwin Home unit at Kalawao of about thirty-six structures was demolished and burned. In 1935/36 a garage and shop building were constructed at the new home, the dressing station was remodelled, and an enclosed entrance to the kitchen was built. All building floors and exteriors were painted and the roofs stained. The new Baldwin Home became a group of red and white-trimmed buildings. There was also further planting of fruit trees. 28 During fiscal year 1937/38, all the buildings were screened and repainted, and a chapel, recreation building, and garage were added. 29 Patient cottages were clustered around the main building and near it also was the small house for the brothers. Next to it was a little chapel and nearby was a grotto on the grounds perfected by Brother Materne Laschet. 8. Staff Quarters Staff quarters consisting of three houses--for the superintendent, resident physician, and assistant physician--were provided along what is today known as \"Staff Row .'I Each was arranged to accommodate a family and each was supplied with servants' quarters, garages, and other outbuildings. In the past the dentist had lived with , the resident physician while at the settlement, and visitors were usually put in his house, which functioned as the staff guest cottage. (The visitors' house, or dentist's house, was later used for kdkuas. ) In 1930 the resident physician's cottage had been recently rebuilt following a fire that destroyed all but the kitchen of the old house. A beach house was also available for the staff or their visitors. 30 It was noted at the end of May 1932 that as soon as the old visitors' quarters building could be revised to provide a new office, the present office of Superintendent 27.

Cooke, just south of the superintendent's residence on Staff Row, would be removed. 31 The chronology of construction of these residences is unclear. The 1908 map of the settlement shows the presence of four structures along Staff Row plus the general office building on the corner. Data was found to the effect that a resident physician's cottage was built in 1901/02 and the assistant physician's house in 1905/06. In question are the construction dates of Buildings No. 5 (superintendent's residence) and No. 8 (dentist's cottage and visitor quarters). In 1890 a superintendent's house and office were built at Kalaupapa. In 1892 a new visitors' house was built near the superintendent's residence. Could -- these be Buildings No. 5 and No. 8? If so, the visitors' house shown in Illustration 30, labelled as a view taken in 1895, might instead be the visitors' house erected in 1906, because it was definitely located in the landing area (see Illustration 81, which appears to show a visiting corral surrounding the building). Although the present superintendent's residence/dining hall building does not appear very old, the structure was remodelled in 1934, as explained below. In June 1932 a new frame guest house with mineral-surfaced shingle roof was placed in commission near the superintendent's residence and the old office building. It measured sixty-six feet wide by seventy-two feet long, with a kitchen fourteen feet wide and twenty feet long. It had a dining room and accommodations for ten persons--staff personnel not provided with other quarters and/or official guests. 32 In 1934 a new kitchen, laundry, and bathroom wing were constructed for the resident physician's cottage.

The superintendent's cottage was improved by a new roof, the addition of a toilet and lavatory, and interior painting. A two-stall garage was constructed, replacing an old single stall structure, the fern house was remodelled, the chicken yard reconstructed, new fences built, and old outbuildings demolished. In the resident physician's cottage, closets were built in the bedrooms, the office room was enclosed in glass, and a stone entrance was provided for the kitchen. The old adjoining dispensary building was moved to a new location on the premises, repaired, and put in use as a storeroom. New servants' quarters replaced a very old building that was demolished, and a new two-stall garage replaced the two old single garages formerly used by the doctors. At the assistant resident physician's cottage, the lanai was enclosed with glass and screen, and new servants' quarters were built. A drying yard was built for the laundry. 34 9. Visitors' Cottage By 1932 a new visitors' cottage was being completed as accommodations for visitors to patients. Two dormitories and a separate dining room-kitchen unit were constructed. The dormitory was a frame building, with asphalt mineral-surfaced roof, nineteen feet wide and forty-nine feet long. It had an ell nineteen feet wide and thirty-four feet long. The separate dining room building was fifteen feet wide and twenty-five feet long. 35 33.

The Wilcox Memorial Building, located within the area, was remodelled to be used for quarters for certain hospital and other personnel. The kitchen-dining room building was reconditioned and painted and screened throughout. The dormitory was painted and screened on the exterior, all floors and IZnais were painted, and drinking fountains installed. A double fence had been built with a hedge growing between the two fence lines, and coconut trees were planted along the shore slope. 36 The visiting cage in association with these quarters was discussed in 1937 and it was recommended that it be remodelled for comfort and to prevent the temptation to pass goods back and forth through the screen. It was suggested there be a double screen extending up to the ceiling of the cage. 37 The current visitors' quarters, when released, was to be converted into the new office for the resident superintendent. IO. Community Hall By June 1934 work was partially completed on remodelling this building. Two washrooms with patent toilets were added back of the stage, the balcony for non-patient spectators was enlarged and a separate entrance and stairway provided for it, and the stages were remodelled. 38 During 1935/36 the exterior of the recreation hall was painted, the roof stained, a new screen erected, and a canec (?> ceiling 36.

Post Office and Courthouse Building In January 1932 the Superintendent of Public Works was requested to proceed with preliminary plans for a post office and courthouse building at Kalaupapa on the southwest corner of Beretania and Kamehameha streets. The post office would measure twenty-eight by twenty-two feet and the courthouse twenty-eight by thirty-six feet. The building would have concrete floors, painted concrete tile walls, and a wooden roof with asphalt shingles. A Isinai, 8 by 164 feet, would go around the building. 40 Work on the construction of a store building, post office-courtroom, and service station began in May 1934. The buildings were of semi-fireproof construction with concrete floors and concrete hollow tile walls. The tile was manufactured at the site using local black and white sands. 41 The frame post office and courtroom a building measured thirty-seven by forty-nine feet. In 1935/36, in the courtroom, a platform was added and shelving put in at the judge's office, and on the Beretania Street side a concrete walk was laid. Exterior walls were treated with a waterproof color coat. An informational memo in 1938 mentioned the procedure for processing mail in the post office at Kalaupapa. All four corners of envelopes mailed had to be cut off. The envelope was then placed in a prophylactic chamber that looked like a large, maroon ice box. The lid of the box lifted up on hinges. The floor was screen wire, 39. Annual Report for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, P---F- 40. Superintendent of Public Works to H.A.

Mail was placed on the screen and 0 the lid dropped shut, making the box airtight. The drawer was then opened and the cup half-filled with potassium permanganate. Formaldehyde was poured into that and the drawer quickly closed. Mail was left in there for eighteen hours. Pouches were likewise treated by the postmaster. The few parcels mailed were deposited at a \"branch\" post office in the administrative quarters. This was not an official branch, but a separate unit of the regular post office. Mail there was handled by \"clean\" employees but was also placed in a smaller prophylactic tank just as a precaution. The tank at the main office was on the IZinai at the rear of the workroom. 42 b. Service Station In January 1932 estimates were given for a public vehicle service station, twelve by sixteen feet, with a gas pump, compressor, and lubricating oil tanks. As with the other new reinforced concrete buildings, it had concrete floors, painted concrete tile walls, and fireproof roofing. 43 It was finished in 1934. 0 12. Industrial Area a. Laundry One of the first new buildings in the rehabilitation of the industrial center was a new central laundry with a boiler plant, which opened to general service July 1, 1931. The structure was sixty feet long by thirty feet wide, and had concrete tile walls, a concrete floor, and a corrugated iron roof supported by steel roof trusses. 44 It rendered free laundry service to the homes, the hospital, and out-patients. 42.

Ice Plant Under construction by the end of 1931 was an ice plant with concrete floors and concrete hollow tile walls. The reinforced concrete building was twenty-six feet wide by thirty-five feet long and housed ice-making machinery capable of manufacturing 1,200 pounds of ice every twelve hours. 45 This ice plant and cold storage unit, placed in commission on January 31, 1932, was used to manufacture ice and store foodstuffs for patients, temporary release patients, and k6kuas. It had individual cooling compartments for meats; green vegetables; milk, cream, and butter; and fresh fish. A greater abundance of fresh milk, fruit, and vegetables would be available at the settlement because of the new facility plus the improved transportation of supplies resulting from the new breakwater at the steamer landing and the new airport. A better diet would hopefully be stimulated among the patients living independently in cottages. An average of five tons of ice per week was manufactured and consumed locally, thus eliminating all ice shipments from Honolulu. Homes and the hospital were supplied from the plant by truck delivery, while patients procured ice as desired through the Kalaupapa store where \"ice tickets\" were issued and charged against the regular weekly ration tickets. Ice tickets could also be purchased by cash if preferred. The refrigeration unit of the plant, containing the main beef room, cooling room, vegetable compartment, fish room, and ice entrance area stored enough dressed beef for a weekly ration issue. 46 C. Poi Shop A new & shop was almost complete by the end of 1931. In 1932 major improvements were made to the building housing the food issue rooms, boiler room, and poi shop. The poi factory and food department building was located beside, and attached by roof and cement runways to, the ice plant and cold storage rooms. The overhaul included 45. p 17Report E the Governor . . . for the Year Ending June 30, . . 46.

General Warehouse In January 1932 the Board of Hospitals and Settlement approved erection of a general warehouse makai of the new visitors' cottage. 48 The reinforced concrete building measured thirty by sixty feet, with a concrete first floor, concrete tile walls, and corrugated asbestos roofing. It also had a concrete mezzanine floor and outside platform nineteen feet wide and fifty feet long. 49 e. Bakery Preliminary plans for a bakery at Kalaupapa settlement were also approved by the board in early 1932. The structure would be on Damien Road between the shop building and the poi shop. 50 It would measure twenty-four by fifty feet and have a 140-loaf oven, an 80-quart mixer, a dough trough, and a small refrigerator. As with the other buildings in the industrial center, it would have concrete floors, concrete tile walls, and corrugated asbestos roofing. 51 The former women's clubhouse was remodelled as a bakery and painted during 1935/36, and new bathroom fixtures were installed. A concrete block addition for the oven and a new garage and 47. E., p. 3. 48. H.A. Kluegel to Lyman H.

Store with Storage Room Also part of the industrial center was a thirty-by-sixty-foot store, with a IZnai nine by sixty feet and a storage room thirty by thirty-five feet. It had a concrete floor, plastered concrete tile walls, and a wooden roof with asphalt shingles. 53 It was completed in 1934. During 1935/36, a portion of the loading platform was enclosed for a feed room, a rubbish platform was constructed, and concrete walks and curbs were laid. The exterior walls were treated with a waterproof color coat. 9. Shops Buildinq The shop building was completed and accepted in October 1931. It was thirty feet wide by sixty feet long, with concrete tile walls and floor and corrugated asbestos roofing. This fireproof building housed the carpenters, painters, plumbers, blacksmith, and the battery-charging plant. 54 Construction of this important unit made it possible to demolish three unsightly buildings formerly on the site of the new structure. h. Corporation Yard : Garage and Gas Pump Additions A two-stall extension was added to the garage and a gasoline tank, pump, and shed installed in the corporation yard. 55 i. Industrial Center: General During 1935/36 the office building was painted on the exterior, one room was remodelled for the electrician's office, and 52.

A washroom and toilet were provided for non-inmate workers, and cold storage compartments were overhauled. 0 The poi shop and food building was painted inside and out. 56 L Landing and Breakwater By the end of 1931 a landing dock had been completed and half of the breakwater stone was in place. A specified area around the boat landing was off-limits to patients and k:kuas and was marked off by a fence of iron posts and a steel cable. Work was delayed for some months because the original contractor who began the project in September 1931 failed to continue. The project was then taken over by the bondsmen. Construction was estimated to be finished by mid-July 1932. 13. Additions to Water System In 1931 a 750,000-gallon steel water storage tank was erected, with pipe connections to the existing reservoir and distribution system. 57 14. Aviation Field By December 1931 the rock knolls on the tip of the peninsula were being leveled in preparation for installation of a landing strip. Framing for a rest house was being erected at the same time. By the end of May 1932, the airport was completed. The runway was 2,000 feet long by 200 to 500 feet wide. Throughout 1934 work on surfacing and sodding the runway was carried on and water pipes laid for irrigation of the grass cover. The frame three-room rest house, eighteen feet wide by twenty-six feet long, had an asphalt shingle roof. Wire fencing enclosed a sixteen-acre field. Although construction was complete, use of the landing field had to await settling and packing of the fills and 56.

Church-Related Structures a. Catholic Plans and specifications had been drawn up and a contract awarded for construction of a onestory frame cottage forty-three feet long by thirty-two feet wide with an ell fifteen feet long by ten feet wide. The shingle-roofed cottage was to be used by the Catholic mission and was completed by June 1931. 59 During fiscal year 1935/36, a laundry was established in one of the cottages on the mission premises-to handle the laundry service of the brothers at Baldwin Home and of the resident priest. On July 1, 1935, the Damien chapel at Kalawao and its premises and graveyard were declared a public memorial to Father Damien. On January 27, 1936, the remains of Father Damien De Veuster were disinterred from the crypt at the Church of St. Philomena at Kalawao, where they had lain since 1889. King Leopold of Belgium had requested through President Franklin D. Roosevelt that Damien's remains be restored to his native land for enshrinement. Rites at graveside were conducted by Bishop Stephen P. Alencastre. A large gathering of government and church officials was in attendance. The members of the settlement were also present to pay their last respects to the memory of the priest who had labored so long on their behalf. b. Calvinist The Calvinist parsonage was completed by June 1932. It was a frame building of ell shape, measuring thirty-five feet long and twenty feet wide from one ell, and fourteen feet wide and eighteen feet 58.

It also was covered with an asphalt mineral -surfaced roof. 60 At the Calvinist Church during 1935/36, a patent toilet and washroom were installed in the Sunday School building in a room partitioned off for that purpose. These conveniences replaced the old, unsanitary facilities in the yard that were eliminated. At the parsonage, the entrance IZnai was enclosed with storm windows and other necessary repairs made. 61 C. Mormon On the Mormon church premises a new parsonage was constructed during fiscal year 1935-36, complete with all services. An old cottage on the site was demolished. 16. Miscellaneous a. Telephone Line During 1932 a connection was made from the settlement to the end of the new line of the telephone company, constructed during the year and terminating at the foot of the pali. According to Superintendent Cooke, the first telephone on the island was constructed by John Cassidy for the Territory of Hawai'i through the efforts of Superintendent Jack McVeigh of Kalaupapa settlement. The line extended from the settlement to the valleys of Waikolu, Pelekunu, and Wailau, crossing each of the gulches with a span of wire. It came up the pali through Kala'e and Kualapu'u to Kaunakakai and along the lee shore to Halawa Valley. The phone was necessary to enable McVeigh to place orders for taro supplies. This way he could communicate with people in the windward valleys and in Halawa to arrange the amounts of pa'i 'ai and tare needed and the time the steamer would call at those valleys. 62 - 60.

Ladies' Social Club A womens' social club was organized in 1932 by Mrs. R. L. Cooke, and it quickly became a social and cultural focal point of the settlement. C. Roads In 1934 a rock crusher, road roller, and other equipment were purchased. As soon as the rock crushing plant was completed, the road improvement program got underway. During 1935/36, paved driveways were completed at Bishop, McVeigh, and Bay View homes, at the hospital, store, gas station, and Catholic Church, and in the landing and warehouse area. Parking spaces at the post office, store, office, and hospital were included. Paving was completed on Damien Road, from Puahi Street to the laundry; on Puahi Street from Damien Road to Beretania; on Kamehameha Street from Beretania to the cattle guard at PZpa'aloa; on Beretania Street from Damien Road to Kauilani Street; and on McVeigh Road from Beretania past the McVeigh Home, including the approaches to the corporation yard and staff garages. 63 d. Grounds Improvement During 1935/36 fiscal year, a plant nursery was developed by clearing two house lots and demolishing old buildings and trees in the area, followed by construction of fencing gates, a lath house, a tool house, and toilet, providing a suitable place and facilities for the care and propagation of plants. A large number of trees and other plants were shipped in from Honolulu, including 1,000 banana sets and 2,000 young coconut trees from Kaua'i. Available local material was also gathered at the nursery for future use. Planting was carried out in various public places, and trees and shrubs were distributed for use in patients' gardens. 64 63.

A new roof, toilet, kitchen, and cesspool were added, and the building was painted throughout. 66 9. Chinese Junk \"Foe-PO II\" On October 25, 1935, Captain Eric de Bisschop and a Mr. Tatibonet were brought ashore from the Chinese junk Foo-po F and cared for at staff quarters. They were seriously ill from lack of food and water and had put in at Kalaupapa in distress. The morning of the twenty-seventh, the mooring lines of the junk broke and the vessel was wrecked. h. Pali Station In early 1936 a barrier was built at the top of the pali trail, a cabin was erected, and a phone was installed. 17. Additional Building Programs The rehabilitation program for Kalaupapa, Kalihi Hospital, Kalihi Boys' Home, and Kapiolani Girls' Home was carried on actively and continuously between July 1, 1931, and June 30, 1938. The execution of 65. E., p. 27. 66. lb&.', p. 26. 474 the program followed the original policies and plans adopted by the Board of Leper Hospitals and Settlement upon its organization. In the summer of 1937 it was reported that a two-year building and improvement program for Kalaupapa settlement and Kalihi Hospital had been made possible by a legislative appropriation of $225,000. The program would begin early in June. Of the total sum, $200,000 would be spent at Kalaupapa on twenty-eight projects. The work would be carried on by the board under Kluegel's supervision. One of the major items was $43,000 for roads, including new equipment and repairs at the crusher plant, a continuation of grading and paving in the settlement, at Puahi bridge, and at the airport. Included in the work would be construction of fourteen new patient cottages; expenditures on the water system and electricity distribution; improvements at Bishop, Bay View, Baldwin, and McVeigh homes; and further improvements at other service structures in the settlement. Other additions would be barracks for nonpatient employees; tennis, basketball, and volleyball courts; a cemetery; a non-patient infirmary; and further landscaping. 67 A report of outstanding improvements completed under the improvement program at Kalaupapa during fiscal year 1937/38 mentioned completion of new features, 5 additions, and improvements to the water system; extensive planting; improved grounds; construction of barracks for nonpatient workmen ; an addition to the general warehouse exclusively for patients; a new corporation yard and garage; a new materials shed and concrete hollow tile plant and rock crusher; and remodelling and improvement of about forty patient cottages. 68 Also continued was the demolition of buildings of various classes not fit for further use. 67.

Ernie Pyle Visit to Kalaupapa The famous correspondent Ernie Pyle visited Kalaupapa in December 1937 and January 1938 and presented his experiences there in several widely-read newspaper columns that were later revised as one chapter in his book Home Country, printed in 1947. He mentioned the high, padlocked gate at the top of the pali trail, with barbed wire stretched around it, regulating traffic onto and off the peninsula. A cabin stood just above the gate, where a watchman was stationed, in contact with the settlement by telephone. Pyle also mentions the Japanese servants quartered behind the staff homes. Staff Row was overshadowed by huge coconut trees, and the homes were almost hidden by banana trees and banks of flowers. A sheriff and five policemen, either patients or ex-patients, enforced the few settlement rules regarding firearms, fighting, profanity on the streets, and petty thievery. A wide variety of business activities kept the patients busy. Six of them were cowboys, tending the settlement herd of 300 cattle, the meat going to the patients. Some patients grouped together and caught fish to sell to the settlement. Others did carpentry work and some functioned as nursing assistants. Four or five ran their own small stores, and independent shopkeeping was encouraged. (The advent of electric current encouraged patient labor by providing an incentive to buy appliances such as radios, electric ice boxes, and stoves. ) All patients received twenty dollars a year, in quarterly installments, from the government for pocket money. Those who received extra money from families had beach cottages for weekend use.6g 69. Pyle columns, December 27 and 29, 1937. 476 0 XI. SUMMARY OF BUILDING CONSTRUCTION AT KALAUPAPA SETTLEMENT DURING 1931-1938 The following are the principal accomplishments at Kalaupapa during the 1931-38 rehabilitation period. During the rehabilitation program, 160 dwellings, dormitories, and industrial buildings and 310 garages! outbuildings, and miscellaneous structures were demolished. Reconditioned structures, under the same classifications, numbered 85 and 45 respectively; and constructed new, 90 and 65. A. McVeigh Home (for Men and Women). As of July 1, 1931, that unit consisted of two twelve-room dormitories equipped with toilet and bathing facilities, a central dining room-kitchen building, an old wash house, a water tank, and five or six scattered smal I cottages and outbuildings that were later removed or demolished, except for one small cottage. From July 1, 1931, to June 30, 1938, the following additions and improvements were made at McVeigh: 1. Patients' Quarters Twenty-one two-room and two four-room cottages were built and the two dormitories and one old cottage remodelled and reconditioned, providing a normal capacity for seventy-four patients. A two-bedroom cottage was also built for non-patient employees. The dorms and all cottages had electric service, hot and cold water connections, shower and/or tub baths, patent toilets, sinks, and lavatories. 2. Dining Room- Kitchen This building, with a capacity for about eighty patients, was reconditioned and remodelled. 3. Laundrv A small laundry pavilion for the use of patients, with electricity, hot and cold water, laundry trays, electric washer, and irons, replaced the old building, which was demolished. 477 Map No. 9.

Hot Water Plant and Circulating System This system was installed with connections to all cottages, dormitories, the laundry, and the kitchen-dining room. 5. Medical Dressinq Station This building was overhauled and modernized with a part-time attendant attached to the medical staff in charge. 6. Recreation Building This structure was equipped with a pool table, games, and reading matter. 7. Garages Three garages for patients' use were built, providing fifteen stalls and one storeroom. 8. Paved Driveways and Concrete Walks Contributing to the attractive appearance of the home was the system of driveways and walks serving all sections of the compound. Along with planting of trees and shrubs, it greatly added to the morale of the patients .I B. New Baldwin Home (for Men and Boys). Upon completion of the new hospital, the old hospital was reconditfw7ed and equipped as a unit with a capactiy for about thirty patients, under the supervision of the Brothers of the Sacred Hearts. The patients and brothers, who had long been at the original Baldwin Home aL Kalawao, were then moved to Kalaupapa. The old home was dismantled and demolished, all of the buildings being beyond repair. The board wanted all patients brought to Kalaupapa for better supervision, more &rect contact, and to better avail themsetves of various services supplied by the board. Of the old hospital group, four or five 1. Board of Hospitals and Settlement, Territory of Hawaii, Annual F Report the iscal Year Ended June 30, 1938, pp. 23y24. ------- - 480 outbuildings were demo1 ished ; former nursery, reconditioned and refurnished throughout, was then occupjed by the brothers; the nurses' cottage housed four or five patients; and the main building was remodelled to provide accommodations for about thirty patients plus dining room and kitchen facilities. A new wing was added to the brothers' cottage to provide a small chapel arranged for combined use by the brothers and the patients; a garage and shop and modern chicken unit were built for the brothers. Other features included a garage and a billiard and recreation room for patients. A considerable area was planted in bananas and papayas. This task was important in providing an ample supply of locally grown fruit to the settlement. 2 C. Bay View Home (for the Aged and Blind) On July 1, 1931, this home consisted of four twelve-room dormitories with toilet and bathing facilities, a central dining room- kitchen building, a hot water plant furnishing limited service, a store house for patients' belongings, a small chapel, and three cottages, two of which were later removed. After July 1, the following changes were made: 1. Patients' Quarters A small extension was made to each of the four dormitories, all of which were reconditioned, including full screening. Capacity was increased from forty-four to fifty-six patients. 2. Other Cottages A new cottage was built for the home supervisor and the one old cottage was reconditioned for kitchen workers. 3. Dining Room- Kitchen This unit was much improved by the addition of a meat and vegetable room, a covered service platform, and new equipment. 0 2. &. , pp. 24-25. 481 Map No. 10.

Serving Kitchen and Dining Room A small serving kitchen and dining room for the blind was constructed between two dormitories occupied by those patients with a covered runway 206 feet long connecting the Einais of the two dorms. The medical dressing station for Bay View was also located in this building. 5. Storerooms Available space under the dining room and one dormitory was utilized for the construction of two storerooms, one for patients' effects and the other for home property. 6. Barber Shop The old storehouse was remodelled and occupied by a patient operating a small store with adjoining barber shop. 7. Boiler Plant The boiler plant and hot water circulating system was rebuilt. 8. Garaae A six-stall garage for patients' cars was built. 9. 10. Recreation Hal I The former chapel was converted into a recreation room. Driveways, Walks The unit was given a new paved driveway and concrete walks. The grounds were also improved. 3 D. Bishop Home (for Women and Girls) On July 1, 1931, within the inner compound occupied by the sisters were a convent, chapel, and storeroom cottage. In the patients' 3. g3+, pp. 25-26. 496 area were an infirmary, social hall and school room, dining room and kitchen, three store rooms, two wash houses, two large dormitories, five dormitory cottages for about six persons each, and several small outbuildings. After July 1, all of the above buildings were removed, with the exception of the infirmary, which was enlarged and reconditioned, the twelve-room dormitory, also reconditioned, and the smal I chapel, which was incorporated as part of a new chapel. Other new buildings and improvements were one nine-room dormitory, six cottage dormitories, a social hall, a dining room-kitchen unit, a laundry for patients, a hot water plant and circulating system connecting all buildings, fencing, paved driveways and walks, and improved grounds. In the sisters' compound, a new convent, a chapel, a modern chicken unit, and a tool and fern house were built, and a six-room cottage was added to accommodate additional sisters included in the operation of the hospital. 4 E. HosDital In selecting a well-located and otherwise suitable area for the site of the new hospital, two improved blocks were designated for the purpose and the twelve houses and numerous outbuildings thereon were either removed to other locations or demolished. The triangular site of about two and one-half acres was bounded by Damien Road and Puahi and School streets. A dispensary unit for the treatment of outpatients was an integral part of the main structure, and a mental ward building with accommodations for four patients and attendant and a four-stall garage for the use of the staff were added. Paved driveways connected with paved streets on three sides of the site. 5 In October 1938 the operation of the hospital was placed in charge of the Sisters of St. Francis. They supplied two nurses and other personnel with additional secular staff members supplied by the Board of Leper Hospitals and Settlement as required. 4.

Staff Row In Staff Row were the homes of the resident and assistant physicians, the superintendent, and their families. Also present were quarters for certain personnel and visitors and for servants, and garages. After July 1, 1931, certain changes were made: 1. Resident Physician's Home After July 1, the kitchen-washroom section of the dwelling was replaced with new equipment, the old servants' quarters were replaced and refurnished, and the old dispensary was moved to a better location and reconditioned for use as a storeroom. 2. Assistant Resident Physician's Home This dwelling was reconditioned and refurnished and new servants' quarters were built, as were a new washhouse and store room: also a fruit and vegetable garden area was developed with a fern house and pigeon loft. 3. Superintendent's House The superintendent's residence and the adjoining servants' quarters, laundry, and former guest cottage, now occupied by personnel, were reconditioned and refurnished. 4. Staff Cottage A new staff cottage with dining room and kitchen and eleven rooms and baths was built to accommodate certain personnel and visitors. 5. Central laundry The most recent improvement was a central laundry and hot water plant and circulating system serving all buildings on Staff Row. The old administration office, formerly in this area, was removed and the offices of the superintendent were located in the old visitors' quarters near the landing. Two two-stall garages replaced the three former one-stall units. 6 6. E., p. 27. 502 ! 0 - G. Industrial Center and Other Structures The development of the industrial center constituted a particularly outstanding accomplishment of the board's program after 1931. Also added were various features of a quasi-public nature throughout the settlement: 1. Store and Service Station; Post Office-Courtroom These structures were of semi-fireproof construction using locally made hollow tiles. 2. General Warehouse This building was of reinforced concrete and measured thirty by sixty feet. 3. Laundry A fully equipped fireproof building, it rendered free service to patients. 4. Shops Building This was a fireproof building housing the carpenters, plumbers, electricians, and blacksmiths. 5. Ice and Cold Storage Plant This fireproof building had the capacity of making about one ton of ice per day with separate refrigeration compartments and accessory features. 6.

Mission Cottages One cottage had been built adjoining the Latter Day Saints Church, a residence had been constructed for the Catholic priest, and a parsonage and garage erected for the resident minister of the Calvinist Church. 15. Social Hall New movie equipment and screens were installed and the entire building reconditioned. 512 16. Police Headquarters The former courthouse was reconditioned and was used as the residence of the sheriff and as police headquarters. 17. Administration Building With the construction of the new visitors'-to-patients quarters, the old unit was remodelled to provide for the superintendent's office, the staff post office, and other administrative functions. 18. Kalaupapa Airport This facility was opened officially August 2, 1933, by Lt. Col. Gerald Brandt, Air Officer, Hawaiian Department, United States Army. Frequent but not regular service was maintained by Inter-Island Airways. Landings occasionally were made by army and navy planes. The field had a 1,900-foot runway and a varying width of 250 to 500 feet. It was maintained by the Board of Leper Hospitals and Settlement. 19. Road Paving This program started in 1935. By 1938 about 3.2 miles of pavement had been laid, including driveways, parking areas, streets, and a portion of the road to the airport. The pavement was asphalt macadam, laid only about three inches thick because of the natural rocky base existing in the area. 20. Boat Landing An extension was made to the breakwater and the boat channel was cleared of rocks. 7 H. Waikolu Water Supply System A number of improvements were made to the water supply system beginning in 1937. The following excerpt clearly describes what this work entailed: 7. @., pp. 28-29. 513 Illustration 156. Old courthouse, reconditioned and used as police headquarters, no date. Illustration 157.

Layout of Kalaupapa settlement, Board of Hospitals and Settlement, June 1938, Annual Report for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1938. -v--p-- a BOARD Cf WXFUALS For present purposes [1938], the supply is considered to end at the 750,000 gallon storage tank (with inlet elevation of 303) on the Kalawao Road about 6500 feet southeast of Kalaupapa. The improvements described were started in October, 1937, and constituted the only work of this permanent character performed on the system since its installation about forty years ago, except occasional repairs to breaks in flume or pipe. The old system consisted of a wooden flume which carried water from a diversion ditch off the main Waikolu Stream at an elevation of about 520 feet. The flume extended 1800 feet down the valley, emptying into a concrete box, from which an 8-inch cast iron line ran to the 750,000 gallon tank. The flume was not covered, and was supported over several gulch crossings on wooden trestles. The secondary supply, from Notley Springs, originated farther down and to the eastern side of the valley at elevation 380 feet. The flow from the springs was collected behind a low concrete wall, creating a small basin, and then led down to the main line through an 8-inch cast iron line. From this point the main line continued to the mouth of the valley, along the seacoast at the foot of the pali, over the former Federal Reservation, and thence to the 750,000-gallon storage tank above Kalaupapa. The first unit of work was the construction of a new dam at Notley Springs, the secondary (but more stable) source of supply * This dam is of reinforced concrete, varying from six to ten feet in height, and about 65 feet long. The springs supply about 1 million gallons of water per day, of which the pipe line can take about 345,000 gallons. This source cannot be used simultaneously with the main source because of the difference in their elevations; however, if irrigation is restricted, it can well supply the Settlement in the event of interruption at the Waikolu diversion. As a matter of fact, it did act as the source during the period of several months when the new structures were being placed at the main headworks. The work at the main intake was as follows: A new dam was constructed, blocking a diversion ditch mentioned in the description of the old system. This dam is located about 200 feet above the secondary source, and about 1900 feet farther up the valley; it is of reinforced concrete ten feet high at the center and 35 feet long, fitted with the necessary accessories for overflow, cleaning, and screening of the supply. It forms a pool which is important only as a collecting and rough sedimentation basin. From here, the water travels in a covered box culvert, of concrete, to the aerator, also of concrete, located 100 feet downstream from the dam. 520 The aerator is of the step type, and serves to make the water less corrosive; the water from the main stream is slightly acid, and aeration tends to give it a neutral or even basic reaction, thus protecting the pipelines below. Downstream from the aerator, and connected by another section of covered box culvert, is a sedimentation chamber of concrete, baffled so as to change the course of the stream, and of such size that the velocity of the stream is reduced. Those two conditions allow the suspended matter to drop out, and the clear water continued into the new pipe line. These structures comprise the headworks of the system. From the last of these, the sedimentation chamber, starts the new section of pipe, replacing the old wooden flume. The section is about 1800 feet long and is laid with 8-inch concrete hume pipe. The line is placed well against the slopes along which it runs and is not vulnerable to slides that may occur above it. This feature alone is a distinct improvement over the old flume, which by its nature was a trap for whatever debris came down the slopes. We now have a completely closed conduit from the headworks to the storage tanks, and this must be counted a major advance in the water system. The 1800-foot section ends where the wooden flume ended, and connects to the old 8-inch cast iron pipe. The existing line was bolstered in several weak points, notably two stream crossings in Waikolu Valley, another at the mouth of Waialaea [sic] Valley, Reservatioz and a ravine crossing within the Federal At the stream crossings the pipe was encased in a concrete jacket, and at the ravine a flanged section was installed, resting upon concrete piers on each side of the ravine, the pipe being self supporting for the short distance between. The 8-inch line branches into a 4 and a 6-inch line in this locality, and the connections formerly spread over a distance of 400 feet, an impractical and unhandy arrangement. The fittings have been centralized, and the reduction and branch now occur at one point. One new clean-cut branch and valve was placed in the line at the low point just preceding the rise to the Federal Reservation, and this completed the repairs to the old line proper. At the 750,000 gallon steel tank, the inlet line and overflow line were moved up to the limiting positions for these lines, creating extra storage space in the tank. The tank was cleaned inside and out, painted aluminum outside, and given an interior treatment of waterproof, rust-resisting material. The two smaller tanks of masonry are being repaired at this time to the extent of having their roofs replaced, the old galvanized iron roofs having deteriorated badly. The entire project took 15 months to complete. The length of time is explained by the fact that all material had to be transported by pack animals, there were no mechanical aids 521 such as mixers used in the work, and the earthquake in February of 1938 damaged the old line extensively, necessitating immediate work on repairs to keep the water system in operation. The bulk of the imported materials used were landed at the mouth of Waikolu Valley by the steamer, temporary facilities having been provided for handling such cargo. This arrangement eliminated a substantial stretch of difficult packing, and also eliminated the necessity of handling the materials twice. Improvements to the Distribution System throvghout the Settlement should be undertaken in the near future. 8. Ibid., pp. 30-32. 522 XII. KALAUPAPA SETTLEMENT, 1940-1980 A. Changes in 1940 1. Hospital The outstanding improvement during this time was the provision made in the main lobby for a fully equipped office unit for the nursing administrative activities. It provided a private office for the head nurse, an open office area, dressing rooms, and a storeroom. Two offices formerly used for these purposes were thus made available for patients' rooms, bringing normal capacity of the hospital to fifty-four beds. The kitchen-dining room unit was improved and remodelled and new equipment added, creating a better arranged and more' commodious operation. 2. New Construction New construction and major repairs were confined to items of emergency or pressing need. Items specifically for patients' use included four wash houses in connection with patient cottages, a comfort station for men and women adjoining the visitors' compound, and a pavilion, partly financed by a private donation. For general settlement needs, the principal work involved a freight platform at the top of the pali to facilitate the handling of supplies down the trail by pack animals, additions to the system of paved roads and streets, and extensions to the new electric distribution system. At the steamer landing an electric winch was installed, the boat channel and basin were cleared of large rot ks , and new bumpers were placed on the dock; the new staff laundry was placed in service and the crematory was opened on a noncompulsory basis for the first time in August 1939; the extensive overhaul of the ice plant was completed; the new bakery was remodelled; and on Staff Row the guest cottage was remodelled for a housekeeping apartment, and the former superintendent's quarters were reconditioned and furnished for occupancy by the assistant to the resident physician.l 1.

Because the Kalihi Receiving Station was situated between Honolulu Harbor and Pearl Harbor and within the limits of military targets, it was considered to be in a dangerous location. The Board of Leper Hospitals and Settlement tried to reduce possible casualties by transferring patients to Kalaupapa. At Kalaupapa, in preparation for a national emergency that might prohibit supply shipments, hospital supplies were increased and ordered for a six-month period. General supplies and provisions were ordered in excess of usual needs. Additional warehouse space was provided to accommodate the reserve stocks of provisions and supplies built up for medical and general use, quarters were expanded, and vegetable gardens increased in size. 2 On May 15, 1942, thirty-five of the fifty-five patients at Kalihi, including all the children, were transferred to Kalaupapa. The presence in the settlement of forty-two patients between the ages of nine and eighteen evacuated from Kalihi Hospital created many new problems and responsibilities for the board. Attempts to provide diversions and education resulted in the organization of Kalaupapa Boy Scout Troop No. 2.

In the early days there had been practically no gardening except for flowers, with all fresh vegetables being shipped from Honolulu or coming out of a can. The lack of shipping during the war stimulated gardening. There was no boat into Kalaupapa for nearly three months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Many of the Victory Gardens thrived so well that the produce was sold to the board for patient use, netting the patients substantial incomes. 524 0 46 and establishment of a school on October 15, 1942, using the school and shop equipment from Mount Happy School at Kalihi. 3 During the war, morale at Kalaupapa was high. Subscriptions were plentiful for war bond drives; fruit, vegetable, poultry, and hog raising increased; and medical services at the hospital were better because of the transfer of equipment from Kalihi Hospital and additions that were made to the hospital buildings. 4 C. A Destructive Tidal Wave Hits Kalaupapa In 1946 effects of a tidal wave were felt along the west shore1 ine of the settlement, from Bay View Home north through the 3. Summary of Departmental Activities, Hawaii (Terr.) Board of Hospitals and Sztlement: -- A Brief Summary Ended June 30, 1942, pp. 4-6. of the Report for the Year Bernard -- -- Punlkaia, a resident at Kalaupapa and Cha%n of the Kalaupapa Patients' Council, remembers the evacuation to Kalaupapa. His recollection points up the fact that despite improvements made in living conditions and other amenities, Kalaupapa peninsula still bore the burden of a dubious reputation: It was that event in history [attack on Pearl Harbor] which was responsible for us children being shipped to Kalaupapa. Honolulu was declared a war zone, and for us kids, I guess the Board of Health considered Honolulu to be a hazard to our health. Of course, they considered us to be a hazard to society too. But for our protection, of the citizens of Honolulu, and maybe the protection we were told we would be sent directly to Kalaupapa. The decision was made quickly. Some children pleaded with the nurses. At that time, Kalaupapa had a dreaded reputation. It was a place where people were sent to die. It was a place without hope, a final solution, a final place of isolation from which there was no return. Children were normally not sent there, unless they had relatives confined within Kalaupapa. Only the advanced adult cases were sent there. But it was the Japanese attack upon Pearl Harbor which changed the Board of Health policy and thus resulted in my final banishment to that place we all feared.

(In 1917 it was mentioned that Dr. Goodhue selected a plot of low ground, surrounded it with a wall, and intended flooding about eight acres for a fish pond.) Effects were also felt from the mouth of Waikolu Valley along the foot of Waikolu pali to Wai'ale'ia Stream. In the settlement, damages were sustained on several frame buildings, including the superintendent's office, in the mechanical and electrical equipment in the ice plant, in shops, at the laundry, and at the rock crusher. Twelve beach homes were washed away and others damaged. Cemeteries along the shore were a shambles, with massive gravestones moved off their foundations and fences and stone walls destroyed. Repairs were necessary by the Department of Public Works to replace the eight-inch main and make certain improvements at the Waikolu headworks. 5 D. Lawrence Judd Becomes Resident Superintendent In 1947 former Governor Lawrence M. Judd along the cliffs was appointed resident superintendent of Kalaupapa settlement. The arrival of Judd marked another turning point in the development of Kalaupapa, for he and his wife Eva Marie made extraordinary efforts to give the residents a fuller and more meaningful life. As mentioned earlier, Judd had been very moved as a child when seeing the leprosy victims at the pier in Honolulu loaded on boats for Kalaupapa. After that time he expressed an interest in one day helping better their lot in life. During the 1921 legislative session he was a member of the committee on health, where he was involved in discussing matters affecting the public health, including the problem of leprosy on the islands. The legislative session of 1921 provided one of the first important improvements in the condition of the patients by giving some electrical power to the settlement. Several small generator units were supplied to homes that had previously had no power or refrigeration. 5. Summary of Departmental Activities, Hawaii (Terr . ) Board Hospitals and Sztlement: A Summary of Departmental Activities for Fiscal Yea&Ended June 30, m, pp. 8-x ----- of tli6 526 0 - On making occasional trips to the settlement, Judd became convinced that more could be done to help the people. He had been able to pursue his interest in Kalaupapa while serving as the Republican governor of Hawaii from 1929 to 1934. It was during that time that conditions at the settlement had seemed bad enough to warrant the appointment of a commission of prominent citizens to investigate the situation and make recommendations. Harry A. Kluegel, an ex-army engineer, had been appointed to make a survey of the settlement, and acting on his recommendations, the territorial legislature of 1931 had largely rebuilt the settlement. 6 E. Conditions in 1948 1. Medical In the spring of 1948 there were 280 patients at the settlement and about 38 parolees and 6 kokuas, as well as about 85 well persons. The practice of allowing husbands and wives of patients to come to Kalaupapa to live and act as nurses had recently been discontinued, though in the long history of the settlement rarely had a kBkua contracted the disease. Medical work at this time was centered in the sixty-bed hospital and was overseen by the resident physician,, and two assistant physicians. Eleven nurses (five Sisters of St. Francis, including the head nurse, and six lay nurses) and two laboratory technicians provided support services. Much of the care requiring less skill was performed by patient helpers. In May 1946 a great change in the treatment of leprosy took place with the use of sulfone drugs--promin, diasone, and promizole. The drugs had been developed in 1943 and treatment with them as part of routine therapy began in 1946. The most promising treatment yet available, the sulfone drugs introduced hope for the alleviation and arrest 6. Judd, Judd & Hawaii, pp. 127, 130, 134, 141, 147. --- 527 of symptoms, and possibly a cure. In April 1947 Dr. Norman R. Sloan, the settlement medical director, wrote in a report to the Hawaii Territorial Medical Association that \"we hardly dare to hope safe to say that for the first time drugs of real value for the amelioration of leprosy are at hand. 'I 7 By mid-1948 remarkable improvement was being shown in the patients, about 85% of whom were receiving one of these drugs. Patients were given a choice of taking the treatment or not. It was stated in August 1948 that about 240 patients were under voluntary treatment. Their ulcers were healing, nodules subsided, laryngeal and nasal lesions improved, and in some people failing vision had been arrested or improved. The death rate was falling and the temporary release rate was rising.8 Children up to the age of fifteen appeared most susceptible to the disease, so no children except patients were now allowed to come to the settlement. Prospective mothers were taken to the receiving station at Kalihi for confinement until birth, when the baby was immediately separated from its parents. In the spring of 1948 there were sixteen patients under the age of sixteen at the settlement. 9 2. Social Not long after the Judds' arrival at Kalaupapa, one of the patients said to Mrs. Judd: \"Before you and Mr. Judd came all we did was eat, sleep, fish and ride bicycles. Now there is something to do every moment. . . .'I IO The Judds were extremely enthusiastic in the fields of therapy and adult education. Indeed, probably the most important actions taken by the Judds were those oriented toward encouraging the patients to keep busy and active. Mrs. Judd acted as a 7.

She also taught in a new series of adult education classes started under the direction of the Department of Public Instruction . In addition to a regular school up to a certain grade, special interest courses offered included carpentry, cooking, shorthand, Wing, and other sorts of occupational therapy that patients with handicaps could perform. Block printing, sewing, weaving, and rug-making from abandoned seed bags were also popular. An agricultural program on the science of farming was also introduced. A new beauty shop was set up by the Honolulu Hairdressers and Cosmotologists Association. A Lion's Club was initiated by Mr. Judd in 1948, with a special interest in the blind patients. A wide variety of social activities centered around Damien Post No. 30 of the American Legion; Boy Scout Troop 46, which held a summer camp every year at Kalawao; The Kalaupapa Entertainment Club, which put on dances, plays, and auctions; the Kalaupapa Improvement Club; and the Young Peoples Club. Picture shows were exhibited twice a week at the social hall, and educational shorts were shown on Sunday evenings. By 1949 twenty-seven patients were working in the craft shop. A craft club had been organized, with a president and officers handling the club business. Activities and social opportunities such as these helped in the continual struggle against the inertia and apathy of the patients, perhaps a symptom of the disease, and the inevitable and periodic discouragement of the members of the staff which is without doubt heightened by the limited area of the peninsula and the inability in this isolated,lspot to get away, even for a few hours of rest and diversion. The Judds' desire was to give the patients something to do, a more normal life. They encouraged visitors to come and patients to go home on visits. Souls as well as bodies had to be treated. When he 0 11. 529 was governor, Judd had signed a law permitting the sale of beer in Hawai'i and this included Kalaupapa settlement. Before that it was never allowed and patients had to bootleg it. Judd also wanted to clean up dumps and trash in the settlement area that bred rats and a loss of self-respect. Abandoned junk was everywhere, in homes, on roads, and on the beaches. This included old autos, mattresses, iron scraps, crates, rusty pipes, plumbing fixtures, stoves, and lumber. Staff and able-bodied patients hauled the litter to pits and dumps--600 truckloads of trash. 12 A program of public relations was instituted, because a need to build morale as well as physical structures was deemed essential. Relaxation of rules was attempted and many of the artificial barriers separating the patients from well people were taken down as being unnecessary and objectionable, such as the twenty-foot-high fence around the guest house and the gate on top of the @, the guard of which was discharged. (From the top of the high gate, a wire from which tin cans were suspended ran to the guard's cottage. Their jingling warned that someone was going up or down. ) Judd also removed the railing separating the superintendent's desk from the bench where patients were to sit when talking with him. Restrictions at the dances at the social hall were also lifted. Direct daily airmail service was initiated between Kalaupapa and Honolulu on March 1, 1950, and patients whose condition justified it were allowed to fly to other islands on temporary leave. Judd also worked very closely with the various religious personnel at the settlement--Father Patrick Logan, the Roman Catholic priest; the Reverend Alice Kahokuoluna, the Protestant minister assigned to Kalaupapa by the Hawaiian Board of Missions; and the sheriff of the county of Kalawao, Jonah Mahelona, who represented the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and was assisted by missionaries from Utah who lived part-time in the settlement. The Mormon Church sent replacements frequently for a while, but ultimately stopped the practice. The Buddhist faith also had a small temple at the settlement. 12. Judd,' Judd & Hawaii, pp. 248-49. -- 530 3. Administrative The settlement administration was directed during this period by the Board of Hospitals and Settlement, whose members were appointed by the governor of the territory. They acted through the general superintendent of Hospitals and Settlement who administered through the permanent resident superintendent of Kalaupapa settlement. Kalawao County was unique among Hawai'ian territorial counties because it was entirely administered by a single territorial institution. Kalaupapa peninsula was actually more closely tied to Honolulu than to the rest of Moloka'i because it had its own water system, livestock, airport, post office, courts, telephone system, and police and fire departments. All food and other supplies were ordered directly from the settlement administrator's office, and all maintenance of buildings, painting, electrical work, carpentry, and plumbing was handled by various governmental departments, the work being done by patient labor or civil service employees. A uniformed five-man police force oversaw adherance to settlement regulations. Department of Public Instruction teachers provided the same academic standards as elsewhere in the territory to patients. The settlement's district court had a presiding district judge appointed by the chief justice of the Territorial Supreme Court from among the patients, and a volunteer fire department was on hand for emergencies. 4. Food and Private Businesses Inmates raised a wide variety of food for patient use. Many residents had successful businesses catering to the patients' needs. Residents could also purchase goods from Honolulu or by mail order. Supplies arrived by boat once a week or special freight could be brought in on the daily plane. 5. Housing Territorial employees were provided with housing and food during the length of their employment. Visitors to patients had access to 531 illustration 160. Schoolhouse/beauty parlor, no date. Courtesy Anwei V. Skinsnes. Illustration 161. Pali trail gate, no date. Society, Kalaupapa. Courtesy Kalaupapa Historical 532 a stove, refrigerator, hot water, and electricity. Beds were provided, but bedclothes and food had to be brought in by the visitor. Relatives l and friends could only sit and talk with patients at the meeting house near the visitors' quarters. Nonpatient visitors or employees could not intrude on the privacy of patient homes unless on government business or in case of emergency. 6. Water A continuous supply of water to the settlement came from two catch basins a mile or so up Waikolu Valley. About five miles of six- and eight-inch cast-iron pipe brought the water by gravity flow into the 950,000-gal Ion (750,000?) storage tanks and then throughout the distributing system. During the April 1, 1946, tidal wave, some fifteen hundred feet of pipe were washed out to sea. On that day the water rose twenty-five feet above normal at the Kalaupapa dock and about fifty-five feet at the mouth of Waikolu Valley. 13 F. Miscellaneous Structures and Sites Mentioned in 1940s 1.

The 1949 legislature then appropriated $10,000 for repairs, to rehabilitate but not remodel the church. 5. May 6, 1946.

She noted that the rooms at No. 9 were larger than in the newer buildings and had lockers. Some residents had lived there more than thirteen years and did not want to move. She stated that Building No. 9 would not be suitable for blind handicapped patients. Because it was situated higher than the other buildings, it was more exposed to the elements. The woman also stated she had been told that the verandah on the front would be screened for a dining room. 16 7. Quonset Huts In October 1948 it was announced that the war surplus buildings at the Pu'un%Z, Maui, naval air station would be turned over to Kalaupapa settlement and Maui County. Those two entities would divide 160 surplus buildings, 17 seventeen of which, plus equipment, would go to Kalaupapa. The huts were eventually dismantled by the county of Maui and delivered to Kalaupapa on July 16, 1949, where they were stored awaiting erection. In August a tentative proposal to construct the fifteen huts was put forth. It included: one large quonset hut for a material shed (storage)--concrete floor five small quonset huts to be used as a dormitory for workmen--wood floors one to be used for Kalaupapa store and warehouse storage--concrete floor one large one to be used as a gymnasium--concrete and wood floor 16.

Two warehouses were complete and a new dorm for nonpatient male workers would be ready soon. Progress was also being made on the dorm for the Baldwin Home boys moving to Bay View. At a board meeting of the Department of Health on May 4, 1950, it was stated that the actual costs of the quonset hut program had far exceeded the estimates. Therefore, no additional huts would be erected after completing the addition to McVeigh Home. 19 8. Staff Quarters In a letter concerning the budget for 1949-51, Judd mentioned the lack of staff quarters. At that time, he stated, staff members as well as visitors were living in the building behind the present staff quarters that was formerly used as a laundry. It provided two smal I bedrooms. In August 1949 the staff yards were reported as consisting of the \"Veteran's Cottage, \" the medical director's quarters (No. IO), quarters Nos. 1, 5, 8, and 14, and the former airport house 18.

Bittel was the settlement fire marshal). 20 9. Description of Kalaupapa Settlement, 1948 A publicity folder on the settlement about 1948 mentioned a few facts about stores, businesses, and activities. Support facilities comprised a laundry, carpenter shop, plumbing shop, warehouse, store, and a nursery for trees and shrubs --all run partly by patients. Three restaurant/stores were privately run. The patients raised vegetables, pigs, and eggs for the settlement, and goods were also available at the main issue store. The major cattle herd was held in Waikolu Valley. The fire department had a 1931 Ford pumper and a 1927 ambulance/hearse. The small one-room school for younger patients was taught by the Reverend Alice Kahokuoluna. 21 The Kalaupapa bakery burned on March 8, 1948. It was decided not to rebuild it as a bakery because it was cheaper to fly bread in from \"topside\" Moloka'i. Superintendent Judd felt that the bakery building could be made into a fine craft shop with looms, work tables, sewing machines, and a kiln for ceramics: While we had authorization to restore the building substantially as a bakery, we had really no need for baking bread, for we found it cheaper to bring bread in by airplane than to bake in the settlement. If we rebuilt as a bakery, there had to be an oven as an essential part of the restoration. We rebuilt the 20. Judd to Hon.

IO. Sanitary Inspection of Settlement, 1949 A sanitary survey of the settlement took place in the summer of 1949 and the following structures were specifically mentioned: a. Poi and Veqetable Room This room, formerly used for the manufacture of poi, was now used only for the processing of @, the storage of vegetables, and the distribution of these commodities. The adjoining room was used for the storage of discarded equipment. The structure was considered beyond repair and in need of rebuilding. b. Ice House It was recommended that the wooden covers used to cover the ice containers in the brine solution be replace-d and the old defroster removed. C. Slaughterhouse This old dairy barn was in dilapidated condition and was recommended for demolition. d. Bishop Home Infirmary This building was referred to as dilapidated. e. Jail This structure contained a kitchen and bath facilities. Filipino cooks lived in one wing of the jail and operated chicken coops and pens.

Chickens were being raised at all 100 outpatient cottages, and at about twenty-five, hogs were raised. 23 11. Physical Improvements at Kalaupapa after July 1, 1949 After an investigation in 1948 by the Attorney General's office, the 1949 legislature abolished the Board of Hospitals and Settlement and transferred the administration of the Hansen's Disease program back to the Board of Health on July 1, 1949. Responsibility for the leprosy program was administered by the Division of Hospitals and Settlement of the Territorial Board of Health. The office of \"Superintendent\" was changed to \"Division Director.\" This was a grave responsibility for the board, which had been deprived of this responsibility almost twenty years earlier after failing to provide for the welfare of the patients or to control the disease. The new Board of Health, under President Charles L. Wilbar, Jr., set out immediately to establish policies based on Wilbar's belief that leprosy (or Hansen's Disease as it was officially known in the territory by act of the 1949 legislature) was a disease and should be treated as such and that public superstition should not dictate policies of medical administration. The policies decided upon were: 1. no more admissions to Kalaupapa settlement; 2. establishment of a hospital for the care and treatment of the disease near a medical center. (Three months after the Board of Health took over, the Kalihi diagnostic and detention facility in Honolulu from which patients were deported to Kalaupapa was abolished and the desired hospital was opened--Hale Mohalu); 23.

New Dormitory and Construction Camp In early 1951 the Division of Hospitals and Settlement reported on progress made at the leprosy settlement in terms of physical improvements. Living quarters had been increased by construction of a fourteen-room dormitory for patients in one quonset hut, and by the addition of thirty-eight bedrooms, two baths, and a living room fashioned from a group of five quonsets that formed a new construction camp for nonpatient employees. Further improvements were made by moving the kitchen and dining room from the old construction camp (former McVeigh beach home area) to the new one and enlarging them. By July 1950 nonpatient workers had moved to their new quarters. b. Baldwin/Bay View Homes Merqe Around the first of March 1950 the Baldwin Home for Men and Boys, because of the reduced number of patients there and a need to save operating costs, was merged with the Bay View Home. The Brothers of the Sacred Hearts continued in charge of the combined homes. In May 1950 the Reverend Alice Kahokuoluna wrote Dr. Wilbar concerning the proposed ouster of the Kaopuiki family from their present home, the house to then be enlarged and improved as a home for the Catholic brothers taking care of Bay View Home. Mr. and Mrs. James Kaopuiki were living in quarters assigned to the \"Guest Matron. 'I The house was a memorial from the Wilcoxes of Kaua'i and had been built as a dispensary for the patients many years earlier. It was now used as a 24. \"This is Kalaupapa,\" 1950?, V.A.9, M-420 (Judd Collection), pp. 5-7. 549 public place where families could visit relatives. Mrs. Adeline M. Ogawa, manager of the Bay View Home for many years, had lived there. 25 The brothers evidently stayed for the time being in their quarters at the new Baldwin Home. On June 11, 1950, a fire broke out in the kitchen of the brothers' quarters. It destroyed most of the kitchen and inflicted heavy damage in the adjacent dining room and bedroom. 26 It was decided that the kitchen would not be repaired and that the brothers would be housed elsewhere. The director of the Division of Hospitals and Settlement advised the settlement administrator in late August 1950 to submit a request for consideration by the Board of Disposal to dismantle and demolish the brothers' quarters and chapel at the Baldwin Home. 27 A day later the director again advised the administrator that the chapel at Baldwin Home was not to be moved, because a room in the brothers' new quarters could be used for devotions. Funds should not be sought to. build new quarters in or near the Baldwin/Bay View Home for the brothers, but an existing facility should be utilized. The only one available was the house occupied by James Kapuiki (Kaopuiki), No. 277 (Wilcox Memorial Building). The Kapuikis could be moved into an apartment in the visitors' quarters, No. 25.

A cottage in the visitors' yard could be assigned to the brothers for use for meditation if there was not room in their quarters. 28 In May 1951 Superintendent Judd requested from the Catholic Church that the chapel at Baldwin Home be moved adjacent to the Baldwin/Bay View Home for the use of the blind patients. He said it was a question of moving the chapel or converting two rooms in Building No. 4 of Baldwin/Bay View into one room and furnishing it with the equipment now in the Baldwin Home chapel. This latter proposition was agreed to. These two rooms were at the left of the entrance in Building No. 4 and would be more convenient for the blind and infirm Catholic patients than walking over to St. Francis Church. 29 In 1951, however, most of the Catholic brothers left Kalaupapa, after fifty-six years of service. Only four were left, one administering the Baldwin/Bay View Home, two doing the cooking and looking after patients, and the fourth functioning as a pastor. Four members of the order who died in service are buried in the St. Philomena churchyard. C. Patient Houses Thirty-seven patient cottages were repaired throughout and twenty-nine painted on the interior. Roofs on all the settlement buildings were repaired. d. Damien Church In January 1950 repairs were started on the Church of St. Philomena with legislative funds. The church was renovated and rededicated on June 16, 1950. 28.

Construction Completed by End of 1950 On September 6, 1950, the Board of Disposal approved a request to dispose of fifteen old buildings at Kalaupapa. The structures were no longer suitable as living quarters and were vacant. Al I material worth salvaging would be used for repairs to other buildings. The annual report for the period ending December 31, 1950, mentioned several items of construction that had been carried out: a. b. C. d. e. The quonset hut building program had been completed as far as funds allowed. Two large warehouses and a large addition to the Bay View Home as well as a five-hut construction camp were erected under this program; the boat landing was cleared and the removal and rebuilding of the rock crusher was underway; a new picnic pavilion at Kalawao was erected; the historic churches at Kalawao were renovated under separate appropriations; alterations and painting of the McVeigh Home dining room and two dorms were completed; 30.

Miscellaneous Structures in 1951 a. Kamahana Building In 1951 David Kamahana offered to sell his concrete store building for $150.00. He had been a patient at Kalaupapa and Hale Mohalu for sixty-three years. He was thirteen years of age in 1888 when he was forced to leave his parents on the island of Hawai'i and was taken to Kalawao. After a couple of months there he became depressed, climbed over the cliffs behind the settlement, and caught a boat to Honolulu. He was caught in 1896 and sent back to Moloka'i. Brother Dutton took care of Kamahana after his return to the settlement, and David helped install the water system at the turn of the century. During the last forty years of his life at the settlement, he had operated a general merchandise store, which he expanded from a push-cart door-to-door enterprise to a 31.

About eight months before his release, he was transferred to Hale Mohalu and then 0 took up residence on the outside again. 32 b. Chanqes in Building Use As of December 31, 1950, laundry was closed, the laundry being processed from then on. The laundry was converted to a the Kalaupapa central commercially in Honolulu carpenter shop and the present carpenter shop was to be used as a machine shop. The laundry collection and distribution center was moved to the old materials shed. 33 14. Progress Report for 1951-I 952 In September 1952, projects listed as having been completed during the last year involved a. rebuilding the dam and repairing water ways in upper Waikolu Valley; b. fencing and land clearing for cattle raising and seeding in conformance with soil conservation practices of the departments of agriculture and forestry; C. repairing refrigeration and cold storage plants; d. rebuilding the perishable food distribution center with a concrete floor in May; and e. painting the exteriors of houses gray to harmonize with the landscape. 32. \"One Time Kalaupapa Patient Recalls Memories of Past,\" Star Bulletin (Honolulu), December IO, 1951, V.D.2.d, Leprosy Clippings, 1951, M-420 (Judd Collection), Hawaii State Archives, Honolulu. 33. \"Division of Hansen's Disease, Report of Administrative Staff Conference,\" July 18, 1951, File V.A.20.b, M-420 (Judd Collection), Hawaii State Archives, Honolulu, pp. 1, 4. 0 556 On November 21, 1952, centralized cooking of meals was instituted for those patients residing in the three unit homes and in the infirmary. Prepared food was delivered in containers to each dining room for serving. 34 The infirmary kitchen was remodeled to serve as the central kitchen. 15. Hansen's Disease Advisory Committee Sub-Committee Trip to Kalaupapa Settlement, 1954 On March 18, 1954, a sub-committee of the Hansen's Disease Advisory Committee took a trip to Kalaupapa. On their return, they noted several items of interest. The sub-committee members felt that about one-third of the homes, which were either beyond repair or uneconomical to maintain, should be replaced'. The last major construction of houses had been in 1932 and the last road was macadamized in 1939. Many of the patients wanted the unit homes turned into cottages and to be allowed to draw rations and cook for themselves. The patients also wanted a gym. Under the 1949 appropriation made by the legislature to erect quonset huts, one was to be used as a gym. A lack of funds, however, had prevented erection of all the planned huts. The group also mentioned that the Baldwin Home had been demolished. 35 16. Progress Made in 1953-54 a. AirDort The Kalaupapa airport was further improved in 1953 with paving of the landing strip by the Hawai'i Aeronautics Commission. 34. C.L.

McVeigh Home In the summer of 1954, thirteen new electric hot water heaters were installed in the McVeigh Home area as part of a general changeover from oil boilers to electricity for heating water. e. Recreation Area The Kalaupapa Lions Club resumed work during August 1954 on a new recreation area between the social hall and Staff Row. It was intended to provide a more central area than the pasture that was used or the Kalawao picnic grounds. 37 17. Proposal for Nonpatient Community on Kalaupapa Peninsula, 1955 In the spring of 1955, some discussion arose over the possibility of the Board of Health establishing a non-patient community in Kalawao County to which it could grant certain concessions. Dr. Richard K.C. Lee, president of the board, had long been interested in this possibility. The board proposed to set aside a section of the settlement in which nonpatients could establish a little community where they could 36.

Staff members and ex-patients would be granted the right to use certain defined areas of land on which to build residences and establish a plot for small-scale farming. Permits would be granted to discharged and/or temporary release patients to operate certain concessions, such as taxi and guide services or boat, fishing tackle, or horse rentals. Nonpatients would be granted concessions to operate a curio store, restaurant, general store, and maybe a small hotel. It was noted during discussion of the proposal, which came to nought, that the only area large enough, with water, would be near the Damien Memorial site (St. Philomena). 38 18. Changes During 1955-1956 The legislature of 1955 appropriated $85,000 for new patient cottages, $25,000 for paving and construction of new roads, and $10,000 for the conversion of the Kalaupapa theater so that it could show Cinemascope pictures. The $25,000 was for paving roads in the settlement. and a stretch of road leading to the airport. It ivas suggested that the new cottages be built in a row along the leeward side of Damien Road opposite the Bishop Home area. a. Settlement There were now many vacancies in the settlement, the large dormitories having few occupants. At McVeigh Home, eight or ten of the patients drew food from the dining room and carried it to their own cottages to eat, leaving only about a dozen who actually ate in the dining room. This pointed out the need for further consolidation of the settlement . It was suggested it might be better to convert more apartments from existing dormitory buildings than to build new cottages. 38. Minutes of the Hansen's Disease Advisory Committee Meeting, April 5, 1955, file Hansen's Disease Advisory Committee, 1953-1959, Department of Health Records, Hawaii State Archives, Honolulu, pp. 2-3. 559 In terms of new separate housing, the Hansen's n Disease Advisory Committee favored spreading the houses in the central part of the settlement on vacant lots or replacing houses that were torn down rather than grouping them in one place. The committee also favored large lots so that tenants could engage in subsistence farming and also avoid a crowded appearance in the settlement. In the long run, the committee advocated further consolidation, further conversion of existing structures to house-keeping apartments or individual cottages, and making some of the smaller units available to single persons as well as couples, 39 b. Roads and Trails It was stated in early 1956 that the appropriation for roads and trails at Kalaupapa included repairs to settlement streets, the road to Kalawao, and maintenance of the beach trail and valley trails at Waikolu as well as of the pali trail. 40 Several projects had been completed by the summer of 1956. It was reported that the Bishop Home main dining room had been closed the first of the year due to a dwindling population in the home. The remaining residents were eating in a small dinette-kitchenette at the infirmary building. The installation of the Cinemascope process in the theater had been completed, and a contractor was building nine new cottages for nine married couples now living in dilapidated cottages. Some single persons occupying cottages in worse condition than some of those to be abandoned by the nine married couples would be moved to 39.

The plan was to demolish the nine worst cottages in the settlement. 4-l 19. Changes During 1957-1969 a. Paschoal Community Hall Dedicated On June 19, 1958, the former social hall was dedicated as the Paschoal Community Hall, named after Manuel G. Paschoal, who had long championed the rights, privileges, and welfare of the people of Kalaupapa settlement. b. Period of 1957-1958 During these two years, several McVeigh Home quarters were converted. Nine cottages now accommodated patients who drew rations and did their own housekeeping. These were in addition to the four apartments converted in 1957 and the nine new cottages built in 1956. Most married couples, of which there were then fifty-two at Kalaupapa, were considered well housed. The census of unit homes was: Bishop Home, eleven residents; Bay View Home, thirty-eight (two married couples); and McVeigh Home, seventeen. In addition there were twenty-two residents in apartments or housekeeping cottages, and eighty-one separate cottages were divided into forty with married couples y'/ thirty with single occupants, six with two or three individuals each, and five were vacant. As stated earlier, the general mess was discontinued in Bishop Home and meals were served only in the infirmary. Only three patients were then in the infirmary and their move to the hospital was being considered. The Bishop Home would be retained for ambulatory women patients who could eat their meals at the hospital. 41. Minutes of the Hansen's Disease Advisory Committee Meeting, l July 10, 1956, file Hansen's Disease Advisory Committee, 1953-1959, Department of Health Records, Hawaii State Archives, Honolulu, p. 2. 561 The 1957 legislature appropriated funds to build eleven additional cottages for married couples at the settlement. A member of the Territorial Planning Office, however, suggested again that more buildings be converted to apartments instead of using the funds to build new cottages. The conversion of the one large building at McVeigh Home to four apartments cost $2,820 for each apartment. The conversion of nine McVeigh Home cottages into housekeeping units cost $2,896 for each remodel led cottage. The most pressing problem in housing now was provided by the thirty individuals who wanted separate homes. If they moved into unit homes it would save maintenance and utility costs, but they preferred more independence. Additional street paving was done in 1956 and again in 1958, because both the 1955 and 1957 legislatures had appropriated funds for the extension of paved streets in the settlement. A fire detection and alarm system was installed in the hospital and Buildings No. 2 and No. 3 at Bay View Home. A chlorinator was installed in the water line between the storage tanks and the settlement. Five temporary release patients were granted concessions to operate a guided tour and taxi service in Kalaupapa; the first tour began in November 1957.42 C. Fiscal Year 1959/60 During the 1959/60 fiscal year the re-laying and reinforcement of the water pipeline from Waikolu Valley to Kaiawao was half completed. The completion date was set for March 31, 1961. Resurfacing of the older roads of the settlement was initiated in 1959 as a two-year project. Half of the work was completed in the 1959/60 fiscal year. After that work was delayed because of installation of a new rock crusher. That apparatus was purchased for $10,875 and installed during the 1960/61 fiscal year, but it did not start operating until December 1960. 42.

Fiscal Year 1960/61 The new administration building was constructed during the 1960/61 fiscal year at a cost of about $20,000. It was built on the open lot east of the post office building and replaced the old building near the boat landing. Also at this time the public works engineer of the Department of Accounting and General Services was drawing up plans for expanding recreational facilities on the basis of a $15,000 general fund appropriation made available for a park. The patients wanted a multi-purpose playing court in a central location suitable for volleyball, tennis, and bas ketbal I. They also wanted a centrally located softball field. The work was to be completed that summer. 43 The conversion of McVeigh Home from a \"unit home\" to a housing area was completed September 30, 1960, with the remodelling of ten more cottages. All the patient quarters in the McVeigh Home area had by then been converted into housekeeping units. The main dining room was closed, and those who had been eating there either prepared their own meals from their ration allowance or were eating at one of the remaining dining rooms in the settlement. Also during calendar year 1960, a variety of general improvements were made. Repainting was done on the exterior of the hospital, five staff quarters, six patient cottages, the Bay View Home kitchen-dining room building, and the released patients' dressing room building. New roof gutters were also installed at the hospital, and in the dining room, repainting and laying of asphalt floor tile was accomplished. 44 43. Ira D.

Period of 1963-1969 During this time only a few changes were noted. In 1963 the Department of Health asked for money to reinforce the settlement's wooden bridge, probably on Puahi Street. The most recently constructed cottages were two-bedroom and painted brown. In November 1968 the fumigation of letters sent out from the settlement was discontinued. In 1969 Marines from Ksne'ohe Marine Corps Air Station repainted Father Damien's chapel, inside and out. Termite-damaged wood was replaced and masonry work was done on the belfry and chapel tower. They also restored the fence around Damien's grave. 45 f. Period of 1970-1980 In 1969 the Department of Health decided that no one with leprosy needed to be isolated. All new patients were to be treated on an out-patient basis. Most could live entirely normal lives except for periodic visits to doctors. Modern drug therapy enabled avoidance of lesions and scarring, and infectiousness was controlled by a new drug, rifampin, that killed leprosy bacteria within three days of treatment. At the end of 1974, 142 patients, admitted prior to July 1, 1969, claimed residence at Kalaupapa, about 119 of whom actually lived there. Many had been there since childhood and for various reasons, emotional and practical, chose to remain there. The state has assured their continued residency, although new admissions have been forbidden since 1969. The Citizens Committee for the Preservation of Kalaupapa suggested that Kalaupapa settlement be preserved as a park after its use as a leprosy settlement had ended. A bill to make it a national historic site was introduced in Congress by Representative Patsy T. Mink. The act of October 17, 1976 (Public Law 94-518), determined that the Kalaupapa leprosy settlement constituted a unique and nationally 45. \"Marines Restore Damien Chapel, 'I Honolulu Advertiser, September 26, 1969, file V.D.2.9, Leprosy Clippings, 1969, M-420 '(Judd Collection), Hawaii State Archives, Honolulu. 564 significant cultural, historical, educational, and scenic resource. It directed the Secretary of the Interior to study the settlement and submit a report to the President and Congress addressing the various resources of Kalaupapa peninsula and providing recommendations for their interpretation and preservation. This was to be done in consultation with the Kalaupapa National Historical Park Advisory Commission, which was established by the legislation to assist in studying the question. The secretary was also to consult with other federal agencies, interested state and local officials, and patients and former patients of the settlement. A report of the study was prepared in July 1978, and the secretary submitted it as part of a list of areas having potential for inclusion in the National Park System in October 1979. Concurrently, the advisory commission reviewed the report and prepared recommendations to the secretary. The final proposals, which became the basis of the legislation--H. R. 7217, which was introduced to the Senate on May 2, 1980--embodied the overall concensus of the state of Hawai'i, the county of Maui, the Kalaupapa residents, and the National Park Service. The Reverend David K. Kaupu, chairman of the advisory commission, endorsed the concept and language of the proposed legislation on March 25, 1980. The bill, which proposed establishment of Kalaupapa National Historical Park and boundary adjustments at existing Park Service units in Hawai'i, sought to recognize, interpret, and preserve the long history of Kalaupapa settlement, commemorate the work of Father Damien and other religious and secular groups in easing the suffering of the afflicted, and preserve and protect significant natural and early Hawai'ian cultural values. It would permit the remaining residents to live at the settlement for as long as they wished, and the policy of protecting their privacy and restricting visitors to the settlement would be continued as long as necessary . However, the enactment of the bill would enable the Federal Government to proceed with the protection of historic sites at Kalaupapa--those related to the prediscovery Hawaiians who inhabited the area and those relating to Father Damien and the Hansen's disease settlement. Patients who choose to remain at Kalaupapa would still be cared for by the Hawaii State Department of Health, and the historic 565 ;favserrnv;;rtn 46programs would be conducted by the Federal A hearing on the bill was conducted on May 2, 1980, by the National Parks and Insular Affairs Subcommittee, and the full committee adopted the recommended bill on May 14, 1980. House Report 7217 passed the House of Representatives on May 19, and in an amended form passed the Senate on December 4. The House agreed to the Senate amendments on December 5, and H. R. 7217 was signed into law as Public Law 96-565 on December 22, 1980. The legislation established Kalaupapa National Historical Park as a unit of the National Park System, its purpose being to preserve and interpret the settlement for the education and inspiration of present and future generations, by researching, preserving, and maintaining the character of the community. The Secretary of the Interior was directed to ensure that patients and native Hawai'ians performed and managed the interpretation and preservation to the extent practicable. In order to provide a well-maintained community, ensure the privacy of the patients, and preserve their current lifestyle, public visitation would be limited to 100 persons a day. To ensure continuing public participation in the development and management of the park, the bill authorized an eleven-member commission, composed of patients and other interested individuals, to advise the secretary. Additionally, the secretary was authorized, with the consent of any owners involved, to undertake critical emergency stabilization of utilities and historic structures, develop temporary office space, and conduct interim interpretive and visitor services on nonfederal property within the park. He was also authorized and directed to enter into cooperative agreements with the owner of any property within the park for the protection, maintenance, construction, improvement, and interpretation of the sites, facilities, and resources of the park. Finally, the bill directed the secretary to reevaluate policies on management, administration, and public use when there was no longer a resident patient community. 46. Hearings on Kalaupapa National Historic Park, Congressional Record--Senate, December 4, 1980, S 15565. 566 XI I I. KALAUPAPA NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK Kalaupapa peninsula on the island of Moloka'i remains today a place of outstanding scenic beauty, the appreciation of which is always blended with thoughts of the years of untold suffering and courageous existence that have been briefly outlined in this study. The three beautiful valleys cutting into the impressively steep cliffs, the rocky coastline, and the white sand beaches were seldom appreciated by the first leprosy victims brought there, whose initial concerns centered around acquiring adequate food and shelter. Hawai'i's fight against leprosy was long and bitter and left on the people of the islands emotional as well as physical scars that will never be healed. From 1870 to 1880 there were estimated to be 1,000 leprosy cases per 100,000 of the population. Kalaupapa settlement reached its peak population of around 1,200 patients about 1890. A buildup in natural resistance to the disease led to a decline to 425 by 1936 and this downward trend continued. King Kamehameha IV's compulsory isolation policy, leading to the establishment of Kalaupapa settlement in 1866, remained the law of Hawaii until 1969, although prior to that time patients were given increased amounts of travel freedom subject to Department of Health controls. In 1969 Hawai'i passed a law allowing residents to move out of the settlement if they wished. The small community now living there, with an average age of sixty-five, stay on because they are more comfortable and at ease there, or because they have nowhere else to go. Most are partly deformed and scarred. They are given medical care and are supplied just like any other small town. Children under sixteen are not allowed to live there, not due to fear of their catching the disease, but to preserve a quiet, peaceful atmosphere for the remaining population. The significance of Kalaupapa settlement cannot be overstated. The residents are among the last remaining survivors worldwide of an international public health policy that decreed the social and physical isolation of leprosy victims. Although the afflicted were being isolated 567 long before the nineteenth century, it was not until then that official policies decreeing that practice were formulated. Other leprosaria that confined patients in accordance with compulsory segregation legislation were located in Norway in 1885; in New South Wales in 1890; in Cape Colony, South Africa, in 1892; in Japan in 1900; in Ceylon in 1901; and in Canada in 1906. Two of the most famous leprosy institutions are Culion, in the Phillipines, established in 1901, and Carville, established as the Louisiana Leper Home in 1894 and taken over by the U.S. Public Health Service in 1921, when it became the National Leprosarium.' About 5,000 residents of the United States still have leprosy. Very few new cases now are reported among people born in Hawai'i. Almost all of those reported are immigrants from Third World countries where the disease has not yet been controlled. It is estimated that twelve to fifteen million people worldwide suffer from leprosy, which is still spread in part by feelings of shame and fear of ostracization that prevent those in the early stage of the disease from seeking treatment. Those that do are treated with new drugs that kill the bacillus that attacks the skin and nerves. Because of Kalaupapa's isolation from the mainstream of Hawai'ian life for so many years, it remains somewhat alienated from the larger Hawai'ian culture. This alienation has been the result not only of the stigma often found in the \"outside\" world that perpetuates the association of the word \"leper\" with an unclean outcast, but also because of an effort on the part of the present residents to preserve an identity, a way of life, and a community feeling that is theirs alone. It is a camaraderie of spirit, based on common experience, and cannot be shared by anyone in Hawai'i who was not a leprosy patient on Moloka'i. This independence of 0 1. Gugelyk and Bloombaum, Separating Sickness, p. 8. Carville is the only hospital in the continental United States devoted exclusively to treating and researching leprosy. The sulfone drugs that had such a dramatic effect on leprosy cases were first used there in 1941. @J. l 568 mind, this close tie with fellow sufferers and the land, is also a tribute to the thousands who died on Moloka'i, a way of keeping their memory alive in the public conscience-- a way of ensuring that we do not forget. This steadfast determination to hold on to the past, to places that are an important part of their lives, was most recently evident in the emotional but ultimately unsuccessful effort to save from destruction the old treatment facility in Honolulu referred to as Hale Mohalu. The facility functioned as a sort of \"half-way house,\" a place in Honolulu where the patients felt they could go when they became too sick to care for themselves. It was closed down by the Hawaii State Department of Health in 1978. A lengthy court battle culminated in 1983 in a federal court upholding the state's decision to transfer' services to a state hospital. The last two patients who had continued to live in the facility and sixteen supporters were removed only moments before the bulldozing of the famous old residential treatment center. The Hawaii State Department of Health operates Kalaupapa settlement with federal funds. Lifetime tenancy has been guaranteed by the government to the residents, most of whom wish to remain there the rest of their lives. The current population is a precious resource. In terms of the Hawai'ian leprosy experience, they are the last of their kind. They retain some bitterness, about many things--forced isolation, separation from families and friends, the fact that the sulfone drugs came too late to be useful to some of them, lack of adequate care and administration, especially in the early days, and the strong influence still exerted in their lives by the State Department of Health. They are pleased, though, that the area has become a national park, for this ensures Kalaupapa will remain a memorial to what happened there. The very physical and social isolation that kept Kalaupapa peninsula from developing a modern suburban sprawl has helped preserve rare examples of older Hawaiian architecture as well as excellent examples of Hawai'ian institutional architecture of the 1930s. In addition there are ruins of some of the early Kalawao structures that will play an important 569 part in the park's interpretation program. Critical, emergency stabilization of utilities and historical structures is now being undertaken 0 by the National Park Service. Research on this Historic Resource Study has attempted to determine which structures and sites are significant in the park's history. The final chapter presents a summary of the physical development of Kalaupapa peninsula and recommendations for treatment and interpretation. 570 XIV. Summary of Historical Sites and Structures and Evaluations of Significance A. Churches (Protestant) 1. Calvinist Church, Building No. 301 Of the six extant churches built on Kalaupapa peninsula, this stone structure referred to as Kalawina (Calvinist) and designated Building No. 301 is the oldest. The first stone meetinghouse on the site was erected in 1839, the second in 1847. The last was built in 1853 and is near the center of the village just west of the community hall. It is forty by eighty feet with eleven-foot-high, twenty-nine-inch fieldstone walls and has undergone considerable alteration due to its changing uses as a jail, warehouse, repair shop, and fire vehicle storage shed. The rubble stone masonry laid with lime mortar is now covered by a corrugated metal roof. The stone walls on either side have been surmounted with two-foot sections of board and batten siding, which is also found on the gable ends, since at least the late 1940s. Illustration 3 (ca. 1895) also shows board and batten siding on the gable end. The open stall for vehicle storage on the southeast corner, created since 1948, has a concrete slab floor. A door in the west wall and a window in the south wall are topped with what are probably original wooden lintels. The door that shows on the eastern end of the building in Illustration 4 (1930s) has since been filled in with rubble. Building No. 301, although substantially altered (Illustration 6) from its original meetinghouse appearance, is recommended for preservation because it is the earliest Protestant church and, other than examples of early native Hawai'ian architecture that may be uncovered in the future during archeological surveys or construction work, is the oldest standing structure on the peninsula and the only structure that we are certain remains from the early missionary and pre-leprosy settlement periods. 2. Si loama, \"Church of the Healing Spring,\" Building No. 710 The old Siloama Church at Kalawao is a very famous early Protestant church. It was built in 1871, its congregation having been organized in 1866, and was the first Protestant church built at Kalawao 571 for the solace of the afflicted. The new church body of Siloama was organized before the end of the first year of exile and before most of the church members had structures to even house themselves. The first gatherings were held on the verandah of a house where the patients were ministered to by the American Protestant missionary from Moloka'i--the Reverend Anderson 0. Forbes--as frequently as possible. These first members, thirty-five patients from various Congregational Protestant churches on the islands, were released by the Annual Meeting of Congregational churches in Honolulu to form the Kalawao church; The meetinghouse was virtually abandoned from 1927 until 1938, after people had moved over to Kalaupapa settlement and began attending there. church The Reverend Alice Kahokuoluna became pastor of Kanaana Hou Church in 1938, and soon thereafter she and some of her parishioners decided to clean up the Siloama churchyard and the church interior. It was during this process that she found in a small vault under the building the old church register and minute-book that provided the congregation's early history. Although the congregation resolved to restore the Siloama Church and site for use on special occasions, it was not until after World War II that the congregation could acquire the necessary materials and labor. In January 1949, after extensive repairs, Si loama chapel was rededicated. By 1963 the structure had again deteriorated and it was determined unsafe for meetings. It was the wish of the board of trustees to preserve the building as long as possible in its current design and appearance. Elmer Wilson, maintenance superintendent of the settlement during the 194Os, was called upon to survey the damage, make recommendations, and estimate renovation costs. The necessary funds were raised, mostly in the form of trusts honoring the memory of early missionaries; labor was donated; and a retired navy lieutenant commander supervised the restoration. Rust and termites had permeated every part of the building. The structure was first demolished and then rebuilt in 1966. 572 Many on the restoration crew were long-time Kalaupapa residents and were Kanaana Hou members, Catholics, and Mormons. Some were state employee volunteers. The structure had new walls, a new roof of embossed, deep-corrugated aluminum, and a six-sided, louvered belfry above a - four-square base tower. The old bell was replaced and a marble plaque in memory of an early pastor and a deacon was reset above the front door. The pews stood as they were originally, with no central aisle, and kerosene lamps and a pedal-pumped organ completed the furnishings. Outside in the yard are gravestones of early church members. Siloama Church today is used for services once a month. It is a strong reminder to members of Kanaana Hou and others of the early days of trial at Kalawao and of the attempts made by the exiles as quickly as possible to bring the solace of religion to that place. As Ethel Damon philosophizes, Perhaps it is not possible for us of today to realize what this little church meant to lonely souls in enforced isolation without proper homes or hospital care, and anticipation of death as their only release.' living in constant The importance of the role of various religious sects at Kalaupapa cannot be overemphasized. Although at first there was much rivalry and jealousy between the groups, both as a result of competition for converts and because of Father Damien's notoriety, these schisms gradually healed and all groups--Protestant, Catholic, Mormon--began working together for the good of the friendless victims they were ministering to. Ultimately the Protestant mission supporters and descendants became the chief benefactors of the settlement, while Roman Catholic brothers and sisters volunteered to administer these various institutions. 1. Damon, Siloama, p. 17. 573 The setting of Siloama Church is magnificent, for the intense green of the lush foliage and surrounding cliffs and the brilliance of the tropical flowers nearby accentuate the sparkling white of the structure. Its quietness and simple design lead the visitor to reflect on the past history of the peninsula and the hope and courage that flourished there. The Siloama Church, as reconstructed from the ground up in 1966, is a frame building on a stone foundation. A square tower supports the octagonal steeple. As Laura Souli&rre and Henry Law pointed out in their architectural evaluation of the structure, the newer church was not built to the same specifications as the 1885 church (Illustration 19). That one had a lower sloped roof, square rather than rectangular louvers in the gable ends, no portico over the front door, wider cornerboards, a darker paint scheme, and a square tower covered with wood in a herringbone pattern. 2 The present Siloama is, however, a beautiful structure, reminding one of New England churches. The passageway that Pastor Alice found on the outside under the pulpit end of the church consisted of two steps down to a small vault. This entrance has since been closed off. The present Siloama Church, owned by the United Church of Christ, is an inaccurate 1966 reconstruction of the original one. It is a reminder of the first church built at the Kalawao leprosy settlement and the importance of religion to the early exiles. It stands in memory of the thirty-five afflicted original members and all others who suffered through those first years at Kalawao. It is also considered to be an excellent example of a wooden mission church with simple proportions and unpretentious construction. Nearby is an old cemetery and there are outhouses in back of the church. Those restrooms, Building No. 720, are wood frame with shed roofs. Although in poor condition and 2. Laura E. Soullisre and Henry G. Law, Architectural Evaluation, Kalaupapa-Hawaii (San Francisco: National Park Service, Western Regional Office, 1979), p. 55. 574 deterioriating , they are socially and historically significant as showing the differentiation that was once made in the use of restroom facilities because of fear of the spread of the disease. One door is labelled for kbkuas, one for patients. 3. > The present wooden Calvinist Mission Church at Kalaupapa is a continuation of the old and new Siloama churches. It was built in 1915 near the YMCA building that was donated as a parish house. It is near the center of Kalaupapa settlement on a plot of lawn also containing a parsonage, parish hall, and smaller outbuildings. The Kanaana Hou Church is considered significant primarily for its architectural values. Soulli&re and Law have remarked that the use of a corner tower to emphasize the church entrance is frequently seen in turn-of-the-century Hawai'ian architecture, and that this is a good type specimen. Its exterior is imposing and well built; the interior is not considered architecturally significant. The historical significance of the church is less marked. It is the last of a succession of four churches of a congregation that has slowly moved across the peninsula from east to west as the focus of settlement and administration has changed. 4. Calvinist Parsonage, Building No. 288 Across the road from Building No. 301, the earliest Protestant mission church on Kalaupapa, was a house that served in the 1940s as the schoolhouse for the young patients. An earlier house there had been occupied as a parsonage by the Protestant minister before Kalaupapa settlement was established. Later this became the hale kahu, or pastor's house, for the Congregational church. Following the reorganization of the colony under the Board of Hospitals and Settlement, this plot of land was exchanged for that of the present parsonage next to the existing Protestant church. The old hale kahu was converted into -- the settlement bakery about 1930. The new two-bedroom parsonage was built in 1932 on the site of Kanaana Church--the enlarged Kalaupapa chapel. 575 This frame structure is not considered to have historical significance. Architecturally, it is similar in style to the McVeigh Home buildings constructed during the same time period and resembles the style of the visitors' quarters and hospital buildings. The structure should be retained while in use but is not significant in terms of the history of the settlement. It does, however, illustrate the cooperation that has evolved between church and state at the settlement whereby the state has willingly erected residences for resident clergymen. 5. Parish Hall, Building No. 287 The stone wall at Kanaana Hou Church formerly enclosed a parish house that was the old Young Men's Christian Association hall, built in 1895 as the gift of G.N. Wilcox and donated by the YMCA to the church. It was used for small gatherings and as a library. The current parish hall is a newer structure, probably built in the 1930s. The building has no architectural or historical significance. 6. Hot House, Building No. 636 This structure was used as a fernhouse to supply plants for the church and shelter them from the strong winds. This structure, with walls and roof built of thin wood strips, is in good condition and a good specimen of this type of building. Several structures for growing and sheltering plants were built in the settlement and one or two should be preserved as type specimens. B. Churches (Catholic) 1. St. Philomena Church (Damien's Church), Building No. 711 As noted in the discussion on Siloama Church, although lawlessness, debauchery, and all manner of vices were freely indulged in by many of Kalawao's first exiles, there were those. residents who had brought with them a deep and abiding faith. It was the Catholics among them who were. much in the mind of Bishop Maigret and to whom he occasionally sent missionaries from a neighboring island. As the number of Catholic patients increased, it became clear that more would have to be done by the Church to satisfy their religious needs. 576 The first step in enlarging their religious life was to provide a decent place of worship. With private contributions from Catholic natives and foreigners and supplementary aid from the mission staff, enough money was acquired to pay for building material. Brother Victorin Bertrant and a native assistant journeyed to Moloka'i in 1872 and designed and erected a chapel in six weeks. On May 30, 1872, its dedication to St. Philomena was commemorated by administering baptism to twelve leprosy victims. The chapel was widely used on the Sabbath to recite Mass and the Rosary and a request was even made for the Stations of the Cross for contemplation of Christ's suffering in an effort to alleviate their own. 3 The chapel later became the focal point of Damien's endeavors to insti!l order, morality, and a new sense of hope among the residents of the settlement. Its growing popularity as a village social and religious center forced structural changes to increase its size and durability. An addition was built on the west side of the church by 0 Father Damien in 1876 and the larger masonry-walled section was begun in 1888 and almost completed at the time of Damien's death in 1889. The church is of frame and stone with a central tower on the front of the structure surmounted by a small diamond-patterned parapet. The interior is, barrel vaulted and supported by fluted Corinthian columns. The church and adjacent cemetery occupy a one-acre site on the north side of the Kalawao road across from the former site of the Baldwin Home for Boys. The structure is somewhat uneven in architectural style because of the several changes made to the original structure both on the exterior and interior. The interior and exterior of the masonry walls are plaster, the interior painted white with red lines to simulate mortar joints. The window and door openings of the masonry part are pointed Gothic arches, while windows in the older wood frame 0 3. Englebert, Hero of Molokai, pp. 134-35; Jourdan, Heart of Father Damien, 1960, ppn9-TO. - - 577 section are double hung. The church is considered to be significant stylistically as a prime example of Kalaupapa vernacular architecture. Its construction was remarkable for the difficulties involved in acquiring building materials and for the scarcity of professional building expertise available. The structure's primary significance is on an international level because of its association with Father Damien and his part in helping reform the leprosy program in Hawai'i. The structure is used as a church only on Damien Day each year, although it is always included on visitor tours given by the patients. Weddings are sometimes performed there, but it is no longer in daily operation as a church. 2. St. Francis Church, Building No. 291 St. Francis Catholic Church was built in 1908, replacing an earlier wooden church built in 1897 that burned. It is a large Italian Gothic-style structure of reinforced concrete consisting of a great nave, a large sacristy, and a high, square campanile on the southeast corner. The side walls are reinforced by four large concrete buttresses with arched windows between. The interior ceiling is of vault construction and there are four rows of pews cut by three aisles. Significance of this structure is primarily architectural. The Hawaii Register of Historic Places notes that \"The use of ferro-concrete for such structures was in the early stage of development at this period, and it is noteworthy to find such a pr;$entious architectural-engineering undertaking in this remote community. It is the only concrete church and is also the largest church on the island of Moloka'i. This architectually imposing building is in use and recommended for preservation, but is not considered historically significant. 4. Hawaii Register of Historic Places, Historic Sites Information and Review Form, St. Francis Catholic Church, by John C. Wright, March 1974. l 578 3. Social Hail, Library, Building No. 292 This building, referred to as Father Damien Memorial Hall and built shortly before 1910, serves as an outbuilding to St. Francis Catholic Church. It possesses no architectural or historical significance. 4. Hot House, Building No. 648 This structure is used for raising plants for St. Francis Church. It is in good condition but not recommended for preservation, although it should not be removed. 5. Rectory, Building No. 294 This frame structure, built in 1930-31, is not considered historically significant. While in use it should be maintained and is in a good interpretive location for illustrating a 1930s type house in future years. It was renovated in 1979. C. Churches (Other) 1. Mormon, Latter Day Saints, Buildinq No. 257 The work of the Mormon Church in Hawai'i began. in 1850 and soon spread to all the islands. As mentioned by Peter Kaeo, J. H. Napela, then assistant superviser of the settlement and a Mormon elder, held meetings outdoors in the early days, frequently in Kauhakc Crater. Jonathan H. Napela was a native Hawai'ian and an early convert to the Latter Day Saints Church on Maui. He assisted in the earliest translation of the Book of Mormon into Hawai'ian. Sometime after 1871 (ca. 1873) he went to Kalaupapa as a kckua, accompanying his wife who had leprosy. On October 8, 1873, he was appointed president of the Kalaupapa Branch of the Maui, Moloka'i, and LZna'i Conference. He continued serving as the Mormon leader in the settlement, conducting regular services. He ultimately became a victim of leprosy and died at Kalaupapa. A Mormon chapel was first built near the Siloama Church at Kalawao. In 1904 it was replaced by another one on the other side of the road. Another meeting place at Kalaupapa was dedicated at the same time and used into the 1940s. When Kalawao was abandoned, the Mormon 579 Map No. 17. State of Hawaii, Department of Accounting and General Services, Survey Division. Kalawao Historical Sites, Kalawao, Molokai, Hawaii, June 1965. 580 0 - 0 chapel there was torn down. The only Mormon church now in the settlement is Building No. 257. It is a frame building on a concrete foundation and is used intermittently. Its construction date has not been found, but is probably late 1940s. Evidence was found indicating that the tidal wave of 1946 destroyed the earlier Mormon church, that shown in Illustration 139. It has no architectural significance and is historically of interest only in illustrating the presence of another major denomination in the settlement. The Mormon presence has, however, been less concentrated than that of other religions. 2. Parish Hall, Building No. 257-A This frame structure, used only occasionally, has no apparent architectural or historical signi??cance. Its construction date has not been found. 3. Elder Residence, Building No. 256 This frame structure, with board and batten exterior, has no historical or architectural significance. It is a two-bedroom structure built in 1935 that is occupied by visiting Elders and outside Mormon church members who visi,t the settlement. It should be retained only as long as it is being used. D. Cemeteries Some of the most significant historical resources on the Kalaupapa peninsula are the cemeteries. These vary from thousands of unmarked and hidden sites to more carefully tended formal graveyards. More than anything else, the vast number of gravesites graphically show the death toll that leprosy extracted in the early Kalawao and Kalaupapa settlement days. Because of the rapid growth of underbrush on the peninsula and the difficulty of removing it except by machete, it has been extremely difficult for the physically disabled patients at Kalaupapa to maintain the plots. They are very important to the residents, however, as a link to their families and their past and a shared history of suffering and courage. The following are known cemetery sites that should be preserved and at some time cleared and maintained as vestiges of early Hawai'ian history. The crypts and headstones found in them are 583 important cultural reminders of a life that is gone. (A natural resource management project should be instituted to control the worst of the plant 0 pests in areas of outstanding historical or archeological significance. ) 1. St. Philomena Graveyard The formal Catholic graveyard at Kalawao abutted St. Philomena Church. Father Damien's house in 1886 stood in proximity to and to the lee side of the burial ground connected with St. Philomena. More than 1,000 leprosy victims have been buried there : Owing to the rocky nature of the ground i n some places, the corpses were not regularly distributed, in places two, three, and four coffins were placed on top of each c &her, naturally the soil became over saturated with the soluble products of the corpses, and the percolating rain drowned the maggots and other grubs; hence decomposition went on very slowly, the surrounding air being filled with foetid and foul vapors emanating from these semi-decomposing corpses, and to add to the gruesomeness of the surroundings, the closeness of the coffins to the surface of the ground encouraged the visits of scavenger dogs and pigs, and by these animals rooting and disturbing the graves, the odor5around Fr. Damien's home was similar to a charnel . . In an 1887 letter, Brother Dutton remarked that the principal graveyard of the village was just behind his cabin. It held at that time about 2,000 graves and he said that nearly 1,000 more people were buried elsewhere.6 Today little remains of the majority of these graves. Roaming horses and cattle have knocked down many of the tombstones and obliterated many traces of gravesites in the area. Today the existing tombstones mark the burial sites of the Catholic brothers who labored and died on Kalaupapa and the yard also contains, most prominently, the site of Father Damien's initial burial and Brother Dutton's gravesite. Father Damien's grave was originally placed 5. Mouritz, \"Path of the Destroyer, 'I pp. 237-38. --- 6. Jourdain, Heart, 1955, pp. 423-24. 584 beside the church almost under the old pandanus tree under which he spent his first nights at Kalawao. According to Dutton, a little flower garden was planted around it, and the grave itself, a mound of earth, was sown with numerous growing plants. 7 Emma Gibson stated that during a visit, Joseph Dutton remarked that he wished to be buried at the foot of Damien's grave. She says that after Damien's body was returned to Belgium, Dutton was buried in a crypt under the church. She also wrote that outside the stone wall surrounding the church were the graves of those who could not be buried in holy ground. These graves ended up on the federal reservation .8 Brother Dutton once showed Howard Case the small cellar room with a dirt floor and stone walls, accessed by a wooden door and a flight of stairs at the rear of St. Philomena. When Dutton was completing the church, he supposedly built this crypt in which to be buried. 9 Father Damien's grave is surrounded by an iron fence and contains a marble monument surmounted by a cross erected by the Catholic mission in Honolulu. As mentioned earlier, Damien's, remains were transported on February 3, 1936, to Belgium and enshrined at Louvain. Just north of Damien's grave is that of Father Emmeran Schulte, SS.CC., who labored on Kaua'i between 1884 and 1907. For almost five years he comforted the afflicted at Kalawao, when suddenly he began suffering excruciating abdominal pains. Although surgery was called for, it could not be performed in time. He died on August 14, 1912, and was laid to rest next to Father Damien. 7. Ibid., pp. 425-26. 8. Gibson, Under the Cliffs of Molokai, p. 116. The small room under ---- the church is empty today, and it is improbable that Dutton was ever buried there. At feast, no other writer or visitor has ever suggested that to be the case. 9.

He spent only twenty-five days at the settlement before drowning in a bathing pool at the 'foot of the pali on November IO, 1902. South of Brother Rochls grave is that of Brother Victor Schumpf, who also came from Germany, arriving in the settlement in June 1899. He worked as tailor and handyman at Baldwin Home until stricken with typhoid fever; he died on February 20, 1900. South of Brother Schumpf's grave is that of Brother Serapion Van Hoof. A native of The Netherlands, he worked in the infirmary and also organized and conducted a band among the Baldwin Home boys at Kalawao. After falling sick, he was sent to Honolulu to recuperate and upon his return, was given the easier task of caring for the aging Father Maxime Andre' at Kalaupapa. Diagnosed as having leprosy, he was sent by the Catholic mission to Japan for treatment. He returned in a year with an extreme case of tuberculosis. After suffering for two years, he died of that disease at Kalawao on May 12, 1910. Brother Severin Boltes, buried south of Van Hoof, was another of the very first Sacred Hearts Brothers to come to Kalawao to care for and minister to the leprosy patients. Brother Boltes, from Germany, was an infirmary worker and tailor, who made the black suits worn by the priests and brothers. He died at Kalawao on September 19, 1921, after serving twenty-six years. See Map No. 17 for a plot plan of the St. Philomena graveyard in 1965. This graveyard is considered very significant. The enclosing fence should be repaired to keep out grazing animals, and the yard should be kept clear of plant pests. 2. Siloama Graveyard Around the early church of Siloama, also, many of its congregation were buried. Again, remaining visible sites are few. See Map No. 17 for identification of four of these and locations of unidentified graves. The cemetery was probably not used after services stopped there in 1927. This is also a significant graveyard. Fences should be kept in repair and the yard kept free of overgrowth. 590 3. Kahaloko Cemetery Just off the southeast corner of the newer water runoff basin along Damien road between Kalaupapa and Kalawao, and just east of a cleared field, is the historic Hawai'ian cemetery of Kahaloko, with inscribed tombstones dating from as early as 1895 and as late as 1914. Several concrete vaulted tombs and headstones may be found, while numerous other unmarked depressions are visible. This graveyard contains some very early Hawai'ian graves and some very picturesque and architecturally interesting tombs and headstones. An effort should be made to clear the area of overgrowth. 4. Kauhako' Crater Burials The cross on the summit 'of the crater is not related to a cemetery, but was raised by Kanaana Hou Church members in 1948. The Board of Hospitals and Settlement contributed the lumber, and Boy Scouts erected it in time for a community pilgrimage during Easter Week. On the western edge of this volcanic crater, however, are two or three burial sites marked with headstones. An 1878 newspaper article stated that one of the leprosy exiles had been told by a native of the peninsula that the deep salt water pond of the crater had been the burial ground in ancient -In times. '\" 5. Papaloa Cemetery The largest concentration of cemeteries is the stretch of coastline along the road from Kalaupapa settlement to the airport. Along this stretch can be found a Catholic cemetery, an A. J.A. cemetery, a Chinese cemetery, the old Ka Huiono Oiwi o Hawai'i cemetery, a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints cemetery, and a Protestant one. The cemeteries are mostly unattended and overgrown, although parts of some of the cemeteries are cleared and/or mown occasionally. Because of the large number of graves and their central location in the settlement, 10. \"A Letter From a Leper, 'I Pacific Commercial Advertiser 23, no. 14 (Oct. 5, 1878). 591 Map No. 18 (three parts).

Miscellaneous The early death toll on the peninsula from the effects of leprosy was staggering, and untold thousands of victims are buried in unknown graves. In addition, there are innumerable ones from the early Hawai'ian days on the peninsula. The archeological survey of 1983-84 identified a vast number of graves and probable gravesites in ten different grid units. There earlier were graves surrounding the old church of Kalawina, evidence of which has been destroyed by subsequent changes in building use. E. Kalawao Structural Remains A fairly large settlement existed at Kalawao from the 1870s on. Remains of a variety of early buildings may still exist, but be hidden by a thick growth of lantana, christmasberry, and other introduced plants. Structures dating from the early Kalawao settlement period whose foundations might be located by archeologists include a hospital compound; foundations of huts or crude cabins for the leprosy victims; other structures lying outside the hospital compound, such as the physician's house, dispensary, and guest house; the settlement store; the site of two Mormon churches, one on either side of Damien road; the site of Damien's cottages-- the first evidently located east of St. Philomena, a later one west of the church that was ultimately moved east again; and the location of the Boys' Home next to St. Philomena. The exact location of the Baldwin Home, the slaughterhouse, a bakery, and the stone reservoir are known from visible remains. 1. Bakery Site According to Richard Marks, a Kalaupapa resident, the scattered stones and house chimney north of the Kalawao road and southeast of the crater are the remains of the village's bakery and the home of Dr. Arthur Mouritz, physician at Kalawao from 1884 to 1887. According to the 1895 map, however, the doctor's residence by that time was northwest of the hospital compound. The nine-foot-high chimney is 599 Map No. 19 (two parts).

The only data this writer found on a bakery concerned the granting of an application by A. Galaspo of Kalaupapa to erect a bakery at Kalawao in 1904.\" These remains are not significant architecturally, but should be preserved. There are so few remains of the early days at Kalawao that any ruins remaining should be preserved as tangible reminders of the little settlement that once existed there. 2. Old Slaughterhouse Other stone ruins remaining at Kalawao are those of a slaughterhouse. Mention was found of two such structures built at Kalawao--one in 1886 and a new one .with a concrete floor in 1890. Remains consist of a chimney stack and oven. The stone stack is covered with plaster and is about twelve feet tall. The base is described as composed of two steps with an oven opening at the bottom. Rock walls surround the ruin, which was so overgrown that this writer was unable to see it except from a distance. As with the bakery remains, the site should be preserved as a reminder of the Kalawao settlement. 3. Stone Reservoir Above the Kalawao hospital site on the north side of the Kalawao road are the remains of a stone reservoir that provided a continuous flow of water to the hospital compound buildings. It is surmised this reservoir was the one built in 1886 to provide water for the hospital. The above-ground cistern has fieldstone walls about eight feet thick. Inside dimensions are twenty by thirty feet, and the cistern is approximately ten feet deep. It also is a significant structure as a last vestige of the hospital compound area of Kalawao settlement and as a remnant of the early water supply system. Il. J. D.

Bakery ruins, Kalawao, 1983. Illustration 178. Stone cistern ruins, Kalawao, 1983. N PS photos. 606 4. Baldwin Home for Boys Site Across the Kalawao road from St. Philomena is the site of the Henry P. Baldwin Home for Boys and Helpless Men. The concrete entrance posts built in 1919 are visible as are some stone walls and the remnants of a ten-foot-tall red brick fireplace. Basically the site is bare of structures and overgrown. The Baldwin Home for Boys was a significant structure in the history of the development of Kalaupapa settlement, but the site today has little integrity. Al I structures remaining at the time of abandonment were burned around 1935-36. The site should be left to benign neglect, but the entrance posts should be preserved. 5. U . S. Leprosy I nvestiqation Station Site The old leprosy station site consists only of concrete building foundations and piers upon which the hospital and residences stood and scraps of metal and machinery. The area in which the doctor's and pharmacist's residences stood is overgrown with trees and bushes, although their foundation pillars can be found in the thickets. Also remaining is the ruin of the \"'Fraid House\" or stone woodshed the Gibsons built into the hill back of their house to provide a place of refuge during a strong Kona wind. Also visible are the concrete fence posts that surrounded the hospital enclosure and a landing that was built nearby on the coastline. It consists of three concrete platforms, the largest about twenty-five by fifteen feet, and six concrete pylons at the edge of the cliff. An unfinished or partially destroyed set of concrete steps lead down to the sea. Their construction date is uncertain, because the station appears to have mostly used a landing area further east along the shoreline. These remains \"are memorials to the high hopes of the intellect,\" Bushnell lamented, \"foredoomed to failure because it gave no thought to the needs of the spirit.\" 12 The U . S. Leprosy Investigation Station was established so that national authorities, with help from the Territory of Hawai'i and 12. O.A. Bushnell, \"The United States Leprosy Investigation Station at Kalawao, \" Hawaiian Journal of History 2 (1968): 92. 0 608 officials of Kalaupapa settlement, could seriously research a cure for leprosy. The advantages afforded by the settlement location in Hawai'i included : the fact that Hawai'ians seemed particularly susceptible to infection; the peninsula's isolation from other islands and other business so that the medical men could pursue their studies uninterrupted; and the fact that every case of leprosy deemed beyond medical help passed through the settlement, enabling every clinical feature of the disease to be seen and studied. The Moloka'i station, at the time of its construction, was considered to be the most modern leprosy research lab in the world. Expenses were spared neither in equipment for the laboratory nor in the private residences. Emma Gibson noted' that \"Uncle Sam furnished us with the best of everything: fine linen, good furniture, Haviland dishes, silver, electric lights, ice, our own water system and even a Jersey dairy and a flock of chickens.\" 13 Construction of the large number of structures, with the attendant labor and transportation problems, was a major undertaking. Dr. O.A. Bushnell has stated that The architects in Washington, stinting nothing, had produced plans for a great institution --by far the biggest complex yet erected in Hawaii. The buildings themselves, designed in the prevailing bureaucratic-baroque style of the day, were huge, airy, high-ceilinged edifices, encircled by wide verandahs held in place by numerous slender pillars--a mainlander's idea of a southern planter's mansion transplanted to the sunny, languid tropics. Identical structures were built by the American government in Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Canal Zone, the Phillipines --and in Honolulu, at Fort Shafter, where some of them (now much modified) still survive. The old Tripler General Hospital at Fort Shafter, destroyed about 1955, was a splendid example of this rather grand, very romantic, and ye& indubitably family-style architecture of that imperial age. What makes the whole story so fascinating is that this grandiose project simply did not work. After all the money spent and 13. Gibson, Under the Cliffs of Molokai, p. 44. ---- 14. Bushnell, \"United States Leprosy Investigation Station,\" p. 84. 609 time consumed in preparing the right atmosphere for research, no volunteer patients could be attracted. When the station opened in December 1909, only nine residents volunteered to come and live at the station for investigation into and treatment of their illness. The project envisioned to mark a new era in the medical history of leprosy fizzled out much more quietly than it began. The patients, unused as they were to the restrictions of hospital life, . . . had little liking for it and proved uncooperative. They rebelled against the rigor of the treatments and the confinement of living within tq3 grounds after the unlimited freedom offered at the Settlement. According to Emma Gibson, one by one the volunteers left and ultimately Washington decided to close the station as far as scientific work was concerned and transfer those duties to Kalihi. Thus the station, which was in the process of organization and construction for nearly four years, 15. Gibson, Under the Cliffs of Molokai, p. 104. Arthur Mouritzhadst!dthat - As early as 1886, Of course there are no cases of cure, and those who enter its portals remain till death releases them. Generally the Hawaiian is prejudiced against hospital restraint and treatment, not only here, but all over the islands. Many of the worst cases prefer to remain outside; the very cases the hospital was intended for, do not avail themselves of the benefits we, as foreigners, think belong to such institutions. Whenever I have suggested to any sufferer outside, whom I thought would be benefited by a residence in the hospital, and the desirability of having him removed there, with scarcely an exception the answer has been, \"I prefer to remain and die where I am .I' From these remarks, it is scarcely necessary to add that I have not thought it advisable to suggest to the Board that a post-mortem room, operating theatre, etc., and other such requisites for ordinary every-day hospital routine, should be added to the present buildings. For, had I any of these facilities, I could make but little use of them, as prejudice against innovations, and foreign medical ideas prevails largely. \"Path of the Destroyer,\" pp. 363-64. -- 610 and which was anxiously watched by the entire medical profession because its extensive investigations were expected to throw light on the subject of leprosy and be of utmost importance to the sanitary and medical world, ended its work. Appropriations were cut, most of the personnel dismissed, and the technical equipment sent to Honolulu. After the station engineer left, the dynamo stopped and the electric system was shut down, so the Gibsons fixed a Pelton wheel that ran the electric lights with water power, and also the ice plant and cold storage room, for a while. Mr. Gibson was left in charge of the officially closed facility with only a few Chinese to help care for the livestock. All the clerical work for Honolulu was still done by Gibson at Kalawao for a short while. After the Gibsons received new orders to go to Chicago, Illinois, the station was dismantled. any of the 0 (One source the lee side abandoned and, as explained earlier, finally completely Emma Gibson has written that Brother Dutton did not get lumber from the station, which was all sent to Kalaupapa. mentioned that arrangements were made with homesteaders on of Moloka'i to remove the structures to the village on a daily wage basis). 16 Mrs. Gibson afterwards inquired of Lawrence Judd, retired director of the Division of Hansen's Disease, what had happened to the dynamo. Judd believed that all the Kalawao equipment had been removed by the federal government and that the dynamo and ice plant were not turned over to the territory for use at Kalaupapa. 17 The reasons for the failure of the leprosy station were many, but primarily because of hostility to haoles; resentment at the reaction of haoles to leprosy, especially Brinckerhoff's offensive precautions against contamination of himself or his staff; the impersonal care and attitudes perceived on the part of station personnel toward the 16. Undated clipping (post 1927) possibly titled \"Optimistic Spirit Noted by Visitors at Leper Colony,\" in Letterbook of news clippings, 1907-29, Hawaii State Archives, Honolulu. 17. Gibson, Under the Cliffs of Molokai, p. 152. -v-d 611 patients; superstitions and the lack of credibility held by haole doctors; resistance to further segregation by confinement in the hospital; and bitterness against the United States in general for the overthrow of Queen Liliuokalani and the annexation of the Hawai'ian Islands. As Bushnell states The patients who rode over from Kalaupapa to watch the unwanted wonders go up might have accepted in time the hospital and the laboratory, even perhaps the nervous attentions of jittery Dr. Brinckerhoff. But the wide swath of open space which they were forbidden to trespass, the great double fences with their locked gates, most obviously intended to shut them out from that citadel not of mercy but of Science at its cold worst: all these, and more--the wash basins, the sterile masks, gowns, and gloves, the very wealth of all that gleaming glittering alien installation--outraged the lepers of Kalaupapa. They were accustomed to the company of devoted healthy people, like Brother Joseph Dutton and other Catholic brothers, priests, and nuns, like the Protestant pastors, and the physicians and other kokuas employed by the Board of Health. And they remembered the legend of Father Damien, who by living among them had become one of them. Inevitably their outrage grew into scorn for the Station and hatryg for the very people who professed to have come to help them. In his remarks made at the opening of an exhibit on the history of the Leprosy Investigation Station at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland, in 1980, U.S. Senator Spark M. Matsunaga of Hawai'i reflected that We lost an opportunity to research and develop an effective treatment for one of the most tragic infectious diseases in the history of mankind, simply because of an emphasis on medical technology witho% the necessary understanding of the patient's behavioral needs. 18. Bushnell, \"United States Leprosy l nvestigation Station, \" pp. 85-86. 19. \"The Federal Leprosy Investigation Station, Molokai, Hawaii--An Opportunity Lost,\" remarks by U .S. Senator Spark Matsunaga at the opening of an exhibit on the history of the Federal Leprosy Investigation Station at the National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, Md., April 28, 1980, p. 7. 612 The station did make one interesting contribution to developments on Moloka'i, however. With establishment of the project, the federal government brought the first electric power to the island. Emma Gibson recalled that The initial time electric lights were to illuminate the island, many of the populace came and stood by the road to see the wonder of this new lighting, came to watch and perhaps, on wending their way homeward, shake off the hold of the last of the Hawaiian gods. Then, before their very eyes, the science of civilized man had demonstrated the actual harnessing and use of the forces of nature, which heretofore had been veiled in mysterious ignorance. Maybe to a few, this event would also bring enlightenment, bring a ray of hope for their plight, where no hope had been, a ray of hope that there would come a day when science would Houdly bring forth its answer to obliterate Hansen's disease. The station also had the most complete laboratory in the world and provided the first flush toilets and ice machines on the island. Whether or not a successful treatment for leprosy might have been found earlier if successful studies had been made at Kalawao is conjectural. As it was, not until 1943, was the beginning of a new era in the treatment of leprosy heralded. Sulfone therapy for leprosy, resulting from research at the Carville leprosarium and introduced there, significantly arrested the disease. In 1946 the drugs began to be introduced in Hawai'i and new hope was given the afflicted. Today the U.S. Public Health Service Research Center in Carville, Louisiana, and Kalaupapa are the only leprosaria in the United States. Other major centers treat people on an outpatient basis, such as Seton Medical Center in Daly City, California, which is a center for leprosy treatment in northern California. The site of the Leprosy Investigation Station and its few remaining vestiges remain today as a reminder of a well-intentioned effort 0 20. Gibson, Under the Cliffs of Molokai, p. 71. ---- 613 by the federal government and Hawai'ian health officials to eradicate the scourge of leprosy. Unfortunately a necessary balance of scientific procedures with existing cultural beliefs and personal feelings was never achieved. Professor Jerrold M. Michael has summed up the project's failure by reflecting that An all too common emphasis on technology without a concomitant emphasis on the important human dynamics of communication, patient education, and beti vior change led to wasted resources and inadequate treatment. Interpretively the Kalawao site has great potential, though few vestiges remain. Although the question of reconstruction of the station has been raised by interested parties, National Park Service policy expressly states that restoration may take place only when essential for public understanding and appreciation of a park's historical or cultural associations, and when adequate interpretation cannot be imparted - through other means. -- The history of the station could be adequately covered in a museum in Kalaupapa, such as the old hospital building, and be further interpreted on-site by means of an exhibit containing explanatory text and historical photographs. In addition to the great expense involved in the detailed historic structure report that would have to precede any restoration, such an action would spoil a dramatically beautiful area of the peninsula. The Leprosy Investigation Station is a significant chapter in the development of Kalaupapa settlement and the story of the federal effort to research the disease. Preservation of existing remains of this landmark federal research facility is recommended. 6. Picnic Pavilion, Building No. 719 This frame picnic shelter was built in 1950. It is representative of leisure activities of the patients, but is not historically of architecturally significant. It should be better maintained, however, 21. Jerrold M. Michael, \"The Public Health Service Leprosy Investigation Station on Molokai, Hawaii, 1909-13--an Opportunity Lost,\" Public Health -- Reports 95, no. 3 (May-June 1980):209. 614 because it provides a good picnic spot for people on guided tours and a place from which to view part of the Kalawao settlement area and contemplate its history and the beautiful scenery. F. Major Kalaupapa Structures and Complexes 1. Hospitals a. Old Hospital, Building No. 282 Building No. 282 is the old general hospital, a large frame building opened in 1932. It is composed of one main section intersected by three large wings. It replaced the earlier treatment centers and an earlier hospital that was turned into the new Baldwin Home. The old hospital is significant historically as the first modern attempt by the state Board of Health to upgrade the quality and scope of its leprosy treatment. It was an outstanding facility for its day, with all the latest equipment, although getting patients to take advantage of its services remained a problem. The structure is also significant in terms of twentieth-century Hawai'ian institutional architecture and its preservation is recommended. Its central location and large spaces give it great potential as an exhibit hall and museum in which to interpret the story of Kalaupapa. Some sort of adaptive use is recommended after proper rehabilitation, although its tremendous size will be a problem in adaptive use and treatment. b. Fumiqation Room, Building No. 283 Building No. 283, a fumigation room originally constructed as a mental ward in 1935 with room for four patients and one attendant, is connected historically in use with the hospital. Until the 196Os, patients planning to leave the settlement for short periods of time brought their clothes there to be fumigated the night before they left. Prior to leaving, their persons would also be fumigated. The structure was also used for autopsy in the late 1940s-early 1950s and was divided into three rooms--one for women, one for men, and the morgue. The building is considered historically significant and interpretively valuable as illustrating another aspect of the social history of the settlement--in terms of restrictions on patients leaving the settlement--and as showing the changing function of buildings through the years. Preservation or 615 adaptive use of this structure is recommended to complete the picture of medical facilities offered leprosy patients beginning in the 1930s. C. Dispensary, Building No. 7 The writer believes this frame structure was originally the promin building, built in 1946 and moved to the hospital grounds in 1948. In 1950 it was altered as a nonpatient dispensary, nurse's retreat, and sewing room. According to one informant still living at the settlement, the structure served as a kGkua clinic in the 195Os, as a coffee room, and as a craft and project room. It is also an important part of the whole medical picture, having been built when sulfone drugs were first used at Kalaupapa. It is now used adaptively as National Park Service offices. d. New Hospital To make room for this new hospital, Building No. 284 was removed. It was a four-car garage, reportedly built in 1944 but possibly dating from the 1930s that was also used as storage space for the older hospital. It was used as a warehouse and a garage for the ambulance/hearse and the medical wagon and was moved to the motor vehicle shops area in 1980. The new hospital, opened in February 1980, is the latest addition to a long line of medical facilities at the settlement and is important in terms of equipment and treatments offered to the leprosy patients. The development of leprosy treatment is an important interpretive theme of the park. Although the structure is relatively new, it should be considered to have potential National Register significance in terms of world health problems and disease treatment. 2. Housing Complexes a. McVeigh Home The McVeigh Home complex in the northeast section of Kalaupapa settlement is important historically and architecturally. It was first opened in 1910 and was intended for the use of white leprosy victims. Its cost was offset by private contributions to provide a housing situation in which the needs of white leprosy victims could be more easily catered to in terms of food and lifestyle. In 1912 the complex had 616 twenty-five bedrooms, a hospital ward, dining room, and social hall. Because so few white residents were living there by 1913, however, the home was opened to other patients. In 1928 the original McVeigh Home was destroyed by fire and construction of two new dormitory buildings and a central kitchen/dining room building was completed by 1929. Over the next eight years, the complex included the kitchen and dining hall, the two dormitory buildings, new patient cottages, a new laundry, a new hot water plant, a recreation building, garages, and paved driveways and concrete walks. Significance of the McVeigh Home complex is architectural as well as historical. Although the present buildings were built after 1930, the home is interesting because its evolution has been dependent on changing social conditions and needs at the settlement. Starting out as an attempt to cater to the needs of a particular race of leprosy victim by providing separate dorms and eating areas, the home was later opened to all races. Beginning in the 1930s it was converted to single-patient cottages as more residents decided they wanted to live as independently as possible. By 1960 the conversion of McVeigh Home from a unit home to a housing area was complete. The complex consisted in 1931 of two residences--a men's dormitory (Building No. 28) and a ladies dormitory (Building No. 12)\"-and a dining hall/kitchen (Building No. 23). These structures were repaired and remodelled after 1931. The recreation pavilion (Building No. 24) and cottages Nos. 32, 33, 34, 27, 30, 25, 20, 19, 16, 15, 14, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 1, 2, 5, and 6 were added after 1931, as were Building No. 22, the heating plant, and Buildings Nos. 35, 3, 4, and 500, all garages. 617 McVeigh Home (Private Buildings) Building No. 18 Use storage room 510 carport 509 shed? 508 workshop 507 workshop 506 storage shed 505 storage shed 504 storage and laundry 503 storehouse 502 storage shed Date of Construction unknown pre-1939 unknown probably post-1938 II II II II post-June 1938 II II a structure is shown in this location on a 500 garage June 1938 map in what appears to be a veget- able garden.

The types of housing present here and the service buildings, such as the kitchen and recreation pavilion, illustrate the type of accommodations and facilities offered to patients in the 1930s and the pattern of change from dormitory life to self-supporting cottages. The architectural style is also interesting as a 1930s institutional style made to appear pleasing in shape and design. It is important to keep the three earlier buildings in good shape and the Park Service should try to retain nearby residences as part of the general historical aspect of the area. Although maintenance of all houses (Nos. l-2, 5-6, 8-11, 13-16, 19-20, 25, 27, 30, 32, 33) is difficult due to the expense involved, the Service should try to keep examples of different types of housing (dormitory, one-, two-, and three-bedroom cottages) as type specimens. Also the retention of an outbuilding such 619 as No. 33A that illustrates how washing was done in the early years would be of interpretive value. Maintenance should concentrate on the main early service buildings and contiguous housing lining the first row of streets on either side of the dining hall. Houses built within a year or two of each other show variations in appearance and design. Individual variations are interesting as an attempt to prevent too much uniformity. Thought then should be given to outlying streets and at least preserving type specimens of different size housing that exist there. The existence of a fine 1930s institutional group setting at Kalaupapa, showing an attempt by the state to combine functionalism and aesthetic concerns, warrants attention being given to its preservation. The structures have been compared by Soulli&e and Law to a plantation camp layout, comprising social services, bachelor quarters, and separate cottages, and are an architectural specimen disappearing throughout the islands. b.

It was early recognized that these helpless exiles were quickly victimized by older male residents and needed special protection. Charles R. Bishop volunteered the money for the institution in 1888 and specifically requested that the trustworthy Sisters of St. Francis supervise it. The home became a model of institutional living as the Bishop family and the state continued to pour money into its improvement over the years. Therefore, although architecturally the complex contains no outstanding examples of early Hawaiian architecture, interpretively the story of the home and its creation is one of the earliest chapters in the development of Kalaupapa settlement. Many of the major structures at the site that were present in the 1930s are gone, such as the social hall, several cottages, the infirmary, and the kitchen/dining room. Added significance is given to those that remain specifically because they are the only vestiges left of an idea of Father Damien's that probably helped save the lives and mental stability of many female patients. It is recommended that Building No. 15 (convent), No. 16 (chapel), No. 2 (dormitory), and Nos. 3 and 4 (cottages) be preserved if possible as major remaining structures of the home and as illustrative of the formal layout, lifestyle, and accommodations offered women there. Building No. 9, although recognized as an outstanding building architecturally, is beyond repair and interpretive value. In interests of health and cleanliness, the building should be removed. The possibility of doing HABS drawings at this point is questionable due to the structure's advanced state of decay. The significance of the chapel lies in its relationship to the sisters' life at Kalaupapa. It was a place where the sisters could meditate and reflect and renew their faith for the task ahead. Although patients may have been allowed to use the chapel occasionally, they were probably relegated to the rear of the structure. The sisters had their own side door leading directly to the convent, enabling them to keep at a distance from other worshippers. 621 Illustration 179. Building No. 2, Bishop Home, 1983.

Bay View Home The Bay View Home was the earliest home established for both men and women. It was especially geared toward care of the old, infirm, and blind. The first Bay View Home was built in 1916 and after it burned a second was built that later housed men from the new Baldwin Home for Boys and Men when it was decided it was not cost effective to keep that home open. It is now open to both male and female patients. It is a place for people to live when they can no longer take care of their homes or do not want the responsibility of taking care of a house.

It was supervised by a nonpatient employee while trained nurses catered to the needs of the infirm. It was intended especially to help the blind. In 1950 it became the Baldwin/Bay View Home for Men and Boys and was managed by the Sacred Hearts Brothers. The original layout had five buildings in a symmetrical formal layout (four dorms and one dining hall). Building No. 5 was added in 1937 as a new dining hall for the blind. With Building No. 4 gone, the layout lacks some symmetry. This little community has significance as a home designed especially to cope with those patients who showed the extremely debilitating effects of leprosy, such as blindness. One of the early dorms has since been removed and modifications have been made, such as adding ramps for those in wheel chairs and a more suitably located dining area for the blind. The buildings are all in a distinct relationship to each other and nicely laid out in a grassy area near the ocean. It is still a well-designed separate community in the Hawai'ian plantation style adapted to institutional needs, whose principal buildings, such as Nos. 1, 2, 5, 3, and 6 should be maintained and interpreted. Building No. 6 has importance in terms of the central dining arrangement, of feeding that was in effect in the 1930s and later in terms of its use in the new therapy programs designed by the Judds. Building No. 8 is tied into the home as - ' 630 a - part of its religious and social life and No. 7 represents the small-business aspects of patient life. Building No. 63's early history is not known, but it is an early structure and its architectural values are important. 3. Industrial Center The Industrial Center became an important part of the settlement beginning in the 1930s when several new buildings were constructed. In it were located the shops and warehouses essential to the smooth running of the settlement. Industrial Center Building No. Use Date of Construction Siqnificance 262 263 263-A 264 265 crematory materials shed (now plumbing supplies storage) quonset storage hut (bldg. materials ware- house) maintenance shop (carpenter) (former laundry) maintenance shop 1938 1939 Hist./Arch.?

Hist. Hist. Although none of the industrial center buildings are significant architecturally, that area has historically been the center of the food distribution, storage, and repair and maintenance facilities because of its location near the landing. It, therefore, is an important part of the settlement core area and in later years will be an integral part of the interpretive story. The writer recommends continuing maintenance of the buildings, most of which are still used. Build%g~ No. 640 is interesting because it is divided into three sections--for male patients, female patients, and kzkuas. Because of this differentiation, one might think the restroom dates from fairly early times. A plot plan of this area dated 1938 shows a small structure near the superintendent's office in that location , which existed in 1931 and was probably built there when the superintendent's office was the settlement visitors' quarters. The fact that it is of hollow tile construction, however, would seem to date it from the early 1930s. The wharf area is an important part of the story of the development of the leprosy settlement. The structures there now are of recent origin. The electric winch was installed in 1940 and the wooden ramp built in 1954. The structures must be maintained as long as they are used and will form a significant part of the interpretive story in years to come. 4. Administrative Center The administrative center has, of course, gained its primary importance since the late 1930s. That was when facilities were updated and new offices and other necessary facilities added. 632 Building No. 61-270 272 272-A 273 290 302-303 Use Date of Construction Significance administration bldg.

Although this area is not considered historically significant at this time, it is the central activity area of the settlement and maintenance of the buildings will be kept up by the state. Their historical significance should be evaluated at a later date. Building No. 290 is considered to be a traditional Hawai'ian vernacular form. Building No. 272 is a social focal point of the present-day settlement. Along with the industrial core area, these buildings should be preserved today and interpreted. They show how the settlement food distribution and other services and administration have changed over the years. Building No. 61-270 could probably be used adaptively in the future for Park Service purposes. 5. Staff Row The Staff Row area is a very old part of the Kalaupapa settlement. The individual residence buildings have been there for a long time, with various alterations made as necessary through the years.

The structures comprise what was considered appropriate housing for the administrator, doctors, and other professional staff and were more elegant than patient cottages. Because of numerous alterations, the structures' architectural integrity has been impaired, but not damaged beyond recognition. The overall recommendations, however, are that Buildings Nos. 14, 10, 8, 5, and 1 be retained and also Hawai'ian vernacular structures Nos. 7 and/or 9 to better preserve the historical scene and illustrate the lifestyle of nonpatient staff. Staff Row contains examples of 1930s wood frame construction and Hawai'ian institutional architecture of that period. 635 6.

Similar structures were used for storage of building materials in the industrial center (No. 263-A) and as a dormitory for male patients (Bay View Building No. IO). They were part of an attempt to provide needed structures using surplus quonset huts, but tend to detract from the beauty of the settlement and are not significant architecturally or historically. The only structures of historical significance in this group are Buildings Nos. 651 and 652, which are illustrative of a rural and self-sufficient lifestyle on the peninsula. 7. Visitors' Quarters The concept of this type of accommodation is a very old one at Kalaupapa, the first visitors' quarters structure having been erected at Kalawao in the 188Os, the facility later being moved to Kalaupapa. The visitors' quarters area has historical and architectural significance. It was the only place where patients' families and friends could see them after visiting restrictions were relaxed.

Visitor facilities were provided by the Territory of Hawai'i during this time. A glass and later screen partition running down the interior prevented any physical contact; fences around the compound prevented visitors from leaving the area. It is unique architecturally because of the building use and is historically significant as a symbol of the isolation endured by patients. Building No. 277, when used as the Wilcox Memorial Building, functioned as the settlement dispensary for a while. Ell-shaped Building No. 274 is still used by visitors today but of course isolation is no longer practiced except as patients wish not to interact. All these buildings are recommended for preservation. The most important buildings for preservation would be Nos. 274, 275, 277, and 278, but 523 also relates to the theme of isolation of patients and strict physical separation from unafflicted family and friends. 8. Structures Concerned with Social Activities Building No. 304 Use Paschoal social hall/ movie house Date of Construction Significance 1915/16 Hist./Arch. This building, which has been modified since its original construction, is important historically because it was part of an attempt to make life at the settlement more bearable, to get people's minds off their troubles and make the village a more normal environment. The interior also illustrates the isolation theme. Originally the audience was separated, with kakuas in the balcony and patients in lower tiers separated by a railing. An outside stairway was added to provide separate access to the balcony from the front porch in the 1930s. The patients were encouraged to become interested and involved in theater, glee clubs, and other presentations in order to take their minds off their troubles. Many famous entertainers performed in the hall, which is a good example of Hawai'ian vernacular plantation-style architecture. 638 Building No. Use Date of Construction Significance 300 craft and storage bldg.

Building No. Use Date of Construction Significance 308 social hal I (Americans of Japanese Ancestry Benevolent Society) 1910 Hist. /Arch. 309 storage unknown none The architectural significance of this main structure is as an example of Hawai'ian vernacular architecture with some oriental influence provided by the lines of the building and by' the torii gate added in 1935. Historically it was important when there was a sizeable Japanese population to support it, as a way of expressing their unity and providing a social outlet. The building next to it was used as an adjunct to the main hall, but has no significance. The main building has not been used for many years, the few Japanese patients attending other churches and social halls in town. Although possessing only limited architectural interest, the building is socially and historically significant as illustrative of the once-strong Japanese population in the settlement and its attempts to preserve its identity. There once was a Japanese lantern in front of the building and a mill stone leaning against the rear of the structure. The torii gate, now removed, was over the entrance walk. The building was used for Buddhist ceremonies as well as social gatherings. 639 lllusttkion 187. Headstone in Papaloa Cemetery, 1983. NPS photo. illustration 188.

Many have concrete foundations. They usually have composition roofing material or corrugated-metal. Mostly built from the 1930s on, they are slowly deterioriating unless frequently used. A few might have functioned earlier as another type of structure (wash house or beach house) or have been located in another area of the settlement, but the information is too sketchy to give them significance for that reason. It is recommended that type specimens of certain types of structures be retained, such as wash 648 0 houses, chicken coops, and pig stys, to illustrate in the future the lifestyle of the settlement. Actual selection of such structures to preserve should be made by park management based on current condition and those most easily maintained. Such factors as location and therefore accessibility for interpretation should enter into the selection. -IO.

The Moloka'i lighthouse at the northernmost tip of the peninsula, owned and operated by the U.S. Coast Guard, is considered to be a significant historical and architectural structure and has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The tall reinforced concrete tower housing the lens, built in 1909, is the most significant item in the lighthouse complex, which also includes houses and outbuildings. This is one of the oldest and most important lighthouses in the Hawai'i district, ranking only behind the Makapu'u Point light on O'ahu in size and brilliancy. The lens is a Fresnel apparatus, devised by the French physicist Augustin Fresnel about 1822, consisting of a polyzonal lens enclosing the lamp. The lens is built up of glass prisms in panels, the 661 central portions of which are refracting only, the top and bottom portions of which are reflecting and refracting, leading to greater brilliancy. The principal sizes of Fresnel lenses were classified according to their order, depending on the inside radius of the lens. The Moloka'i light is a second order light, denoting 27.6 inches from the center of the light to the inner surface of the lens. This is one of the few original lighthouse structures in Hawai'i still in use, having been made automatic in 1966. Originally, a five-room cottage was provided for the light keeper. The house and outbuildings are not important architecturally but it is recommended that at least one of the residences be preserved as part of a light station noteworthy because of its unusual remoteness and isolation. 14. Shipwreck The remains of the Kaala, shipwrecked in 1932, lie in less than thirty feet of water off the northeast coast of Kalaupapa peninsula. Through the years parts of the ship have washed ashore and the lumber has reportedly been used in house construction in Kalaupapa settlement. Today the engine block of the wreck is still visible as a silent reminder of the dangers of the sea and of shipping to Kalaupapa. It may have potential as an underwater archeological resource, although neither the extent of the wreck nor the type of vessel it was is known by the writer. 15. Roads and Trails The paii trail is historically and to some extent architecturally significant as the only means of access \"topside\" for patients and staff. It was mostly used to transport cattle to the settlement and today is used by visitors. The road to Kalawao was originally improved by Father Damien and the residents, and it and a trail along the coastline connected Kalaupapa and Kalawao. It should be preserved. Any remaining sections of the Waihanau trail should be considered historically significant. 662 16. Monuments a. Father Damien At the intersection of Puahi and Damien roads is the red granite monument for whose erection funds were collected by the Prince of Wales (later Edward VI I ). It was unveiled on September 11, 1893. On the face of the tablet is a bas-relief of Father Damien's head and the inscription reads Joseph Damien de Veuster, 1839-1887. \"Greater love hath no man than this that he should lay down his life for his friends.\" This monument was erected to his memory by the people of England. This is a significant monument because it illustrates how the story of Damien and the settlement residents had aroused the interest and sympathy of countries across the ocean. b. Mother Marianne Mother Marianne's importance stems from the fact that in 1883, in responding to an appeal for help for leprosy victims in Hawai'i, she was the first sister of an American religious group to lead mission work in a foreign land and headed the first group of Catholic sisters to minister to persons on Moloka'i. During her time in Hawai'i, she was first in charge of the branch hospital at Kaka'ako Receiving Station for Leprosy Patients in Honolulu, and from 1888 to 1918 she was in charge of the Bishop Home for Girls at Kalaupapa. Hanley and Bushnell have pointed out that because she was modest and shunned publicity of any kind, very few people beyond the limits of the Leprosarium knew about the Franciscans' efforts in Hawaii. The world, having discovered, admired, and lost Father Damien, went on believing that he was the only one who gave up his life for the lepers. It paid no attention to Mother Marianne and her Franciscans. Nor did it heed the quiet Sacred Hearts brothers, the Catholic priests and Protestant pastors, who followed in Father Damien's footsteps. It soon forgot the lepers of Molokai and ignored the followers of Christ as they ministered to the patients' bodies and their souls. Mother Marianne did not mind the world's 663 inattention. spirit, She lived true to herself, in the fortress of hss continuing to work for the benefit of her \"children.\" Mother Marianne died in the summer of 1918 at the age of eighty and was buried not far from the Damien monument at the foot of a small, shady hill. In 1974 procedures were begun for the promotion of Mother Marianne for Sainthood by the Franciscan Order with the Introduction of the Cause for Mother Marianne, which was granted by the Sacred Congregation for the Causes of Saints. In 1980 the most Reverend John J. Scanlon, Bishop of Honolulu, appointed an Historical Commission for the \"Cause of Mother Marianne. \" 23 The monument is important as a visual reminder of this much-beloved woman who devoted a lifetime to leprosy sufferers in Honolulu and at Kalaupapa. l 22.

Recommendations for Interpretation and Resources Management Kalawao and Kalaupapa leprosy settlements were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. The National Register boundary generally is the same as the Kalawao County line. The National Register form includes statements on archeology and the Kalawao and Kalaupapa settlement periods. The Moloka'i lighthouse was entered separately on the National Register on March 25, 1982. The settlement also was approved as a National Historic Landmark on January 7, 1976. The writer feels that the following sites should be. seriously considered for perservation on the basis of historical significance: Kalawao Primary Significance: St. Philomena Catholic Church and cemetery Siloama Protestant Church and cemetery U . S. Leprosy Investigation Station ruins Baldwin Home ruins stone water reservoir slaughterhouse ruin bakery ruin stone reservoir in Waikolu Valley--remnant of early water system These structures and sites should be considered for priority action in terms of preservation and interpretation because of their age, their fragility, and their interpretive values. The slaughterhouse ruin, the U .S. Leprosy Investigation Station site, and the cistern ruin should be cleared of growth to the extent feasible through initiation of a natural resources management plan. Kalaupapa Primary Significance (Individual buildings of importance within each home unit were discussed earlier): Staff Row Bishop Home Bay View Home McVeigh Home landing and breakwater area visitor's quarters and pavilion old hospital, including fumigation room and promin building lighthouse 669 bathrooms showing division of use between patients and k3kua,/ cemeteries l farms, which are rapidly deteriorating but illustrate a rural lifestyle clubhouses patient smal I -business structures older vernacular-style houses Secondary Significance (Structures are included in this category due to future historical importance and less need now for maintenance work) : industrial center (shops and maintenance) administrative center (store, post office-courthouse, main office) Paschoal Hall jail St. Francis Church Kanaana Hou Church craft shops Other: residences It should be noted that the entire Kalaupapa peninsula is a historic district that has evolved over a long period of time. The significance of the district hinges on the relationships of structures to each other, and their development over time is a result of changing social and medical conditions worldwide. It is not possible to retain only primary structures and tear down secondary ones without drastically changing the character of the entire district. Demolition of structures should take place only on a limited basis, if at all, and only after proper planning, so that a major alteration of the settlement does not occur. Although a priority system for the stabilization and/or adaptive use of significant structures must of necessity be established because of limited funds for that purpose, it should be remembered that all resources on the peninsula are considered significant to the park's interpretive story. The primary criteria for building treatment should be significance and condition. Historically important wooden structures that deteriorate quickly should be taken care of before significant concrete structures, for instance. Those resources that are especially endangered due to fragility of the fabric and/or the threat of severe impacts should be high on the priority list. Those structures that will not be stabilized or used 670 adaptively by the park should be left to natural deterioration whenever possible; if removal is considered necessary for safety or health reasons, proper compliance procedures must be met. Several residences at the settlement have lost integrity and are in a complete state of disrepair. There are, however, still many good examples of period housing that are salvageable, and it is the feeling of this writer, as well as of Soulli8re and Law, that in the case of these structures, preservation emphasis should be on those that are representative of particular styles and types. Preservation of such structures is necessary in addition to that of major structures to preserve an accurate historical scene. In future years the structures retained should enable a good understanding of what life was like at the settlement during various time periods. Samples of cottages, medical facilities, administrative and service buildings, and outbuildings such as wash houses and hot houses should be preserved. These last should be retained in conjunction with cottages when possible to present a total living unit, explaining how people lived, performed their daily chores, and relaxed. Any structures that are last examples of their type in the islands or on the peninsual should have high maintenance and stabilization priority, such as the AJA clubhouse and the visitors' pavilion. Even the later 195Os-196s homes are important because they illustrate a mass-produced architecture that was totally different from the 1930s attempts by the state to provide some aesthetic considerations and stylistic detail. Beach houses are also significant because they show an attempt to get a change of scenery outside the settlement when patients were still restricted from leaving the peninsula. They were recreational houses, where people could go to fish and swim. Many were built of recycled materials. It is recommended that at least one of each of these types of houses be preserved. All buildings still in use should of course be maintained until no longer needed or until they pose a safety hazard. Then the park will 671 c need to go to a priority system of retaining type specimens and/or those necessary for interpretation or usable for park purposes. Those that are deemed significant need to be considered for long-term maintenance. Many of them can no doubt be used adaptively. Some structures simply are not necessary to defining the importance of specific areas, such as garages, old freezers,. laundries, and the like, and no more than one or two type specimens are necessary for interpretive purposes. The park resident architect is probably the best person to choose the representative buildings to preserve based on a knowledge of current condition and possibilities for rehabilitation. The historical background of the leprosy settlement has now been fairly well documented through this Historic Resource Study and a variety of books and articles that have focused on certain aspects of the settlement. A fine architectural evaluation of settlement buildings was completed in 1979. An archeological survey of parts of the peninsula was completed this last winter. The other major components of a solid cultural resource data base would be oral history reserach on patient recollections of life at the settlement and an ethnographic study. Because the patients are not a renewable resource, a compilation of patient experiences, photographs, letters, and records should be accomplished without delay. All structures and sites on Kalaupapa peninsula are protected by their National Register status. It is recommended that at some time in the future after further archeological surveys, oral history projects, and ethnographic studies have been completed, the National Register form be updated by the Pacific Area Office and park personnel in order to include all resource data base material. This updated form could more precisely delineate significant archeological and historical sub-districts based upon the completion of all studies necessary for those judgements. 672 XVI. Conclusions and Recommendations for Further Study Over the years the story of the exile of Hawai'i's leprosy victims to the island of Moloka'i has been of interest to historians, sociologists, medical reserachers, politicians, and the public at large. Much has been written about the experiences of the leprosy patients and about the religious and secular personnel who helped them during various periods of the settlement's development. In the course of scrutinizing the data available on Kalaupapa's history, this writer came to the conclusion that certain episodes have been highlighted by other writers that perhaps do not present a totally accurate picture of the times. One of the aspects of the very early history of the settlement that struck this writer as interesting were the sizeable budgets appropriated by the kingdom and territory of Hawai'i for the care of patients at Kalaupapa over the years, including construction of houses and medical and recreational facilities, as well as considerable expenditures for research and treatment. From the very earliest years of the colony, the Hawai'ian government made a committment to the afflicted that was unusual for its time and place. Although there was certainly much that was inhumane in the forced separation of the sick from their families and the general public, there was also much that was humane, especially as the Hawai'ian government began to realize the true extent and effects of the disease. Hawai'i was trying to cope with a scourge of epidemic proportions at a critical time in its history-- as particularly powerful foreign influences were wreaking havoc on a cultural tradition that had been in place for centuries. No disease as pervasive or as frustratingly incurable as leprosy had been encountered before, and coping with it became a daily trial and error process that consumed much of the time of the monarchy and the legislature. The stories of the sick being transported to Kalawao and then thrown off the ships to swim ashore as best they could are dubious at best. Although this might have happened when storms prevented the steamers from landing, it does not appear to have been a usual practice. 673 The widespread neglect of residents so frequently reported upon in the early days was certainly true for a while, but it should be remembered that the government took great pains in the selection of a site for its leprosy settlement and initially felt that it had chosen an ideal place, with plentiful water and land for farming. It was confident that the sick would work for themselves, producing the necessary food and building shelters. It generally expected much more effort and involvement on the part of the first exiles, not realizing how emotionally demoralizing and physically debilitating their condition was. Even harder to analyze than the government's early management or mismanagement of the colony, is the role of Father Damien in the history of leprosy in Hawai'i. Damien has been extolled as the savior of the sick and the person responsible for most of the early social and physical improvements at the settlement. Certainly one cannot research the life of Father Damien without becoming emotionally charged by the man's life and accomplishments. He was unique --a dynamic and resourceful person who, by the mere strength of his personality and religious convictions and the fact that he later fell victim to the disease himself, became a visual symbol of the plight of leprosy sufferers everywhere. Because of this, it is often hard to dispassionately and objectively assess his role in the development of Kalaupapa. The committment of the Board of Health to the settlement had been made before Damien's arrival. At the same time, both Catholic and non-Catholic missionaries had already contributed a great deal of time and effort to the patients' well-being. Damien's story has loomed larger primarily because he was the first European clergyman to reside permanently at the settlement-- amidst much publicity not of his making--a fact that immediately gained him worldwide prominence. His primary role at the settlement was as a facilitator, a liaison between the people and the government, who was able, because of his firsthand knowledge of the needs of the patients, to ensure that the vast sums of money appropriated by the government were more wisely spent. 674 I - The Board of Health's concern over Damien's arrival and his future role at the settlement--which Damien and some of his supporters felt was unjustified-- are easy to understand from this vantage point in time, considering the delicacy of the situation and the already seemingly insurmountable problems involved in trying to feed and house the sick. Damien may well have appeared at first as simply another obstruction to the smooth administration of the colony. There are always two sides to every issue, and both need to be explained when assessing the relationship between Damien and the Hawai'ian Board of Health. One well-known story relates that after Damien contracted leprosy, he announced his affliction to the people by beginning one of his sermons with the words \"We lepers. 'I Although this is a dramatic scenario, as stated earlier in this report, Damien used that form of address from the beginning of his stay to bind himself more closely to his parishioners. A multitude of other similar anecdotes about Damien may likewise not bear up under close scrutiny; as it is, however, his achievements need little embellishment. It is interesting to speculate upon what Damien's continuing role at the settlement might have been had he lived for another twenty or thirty years. In summary, the story of leprosy in Hawai'i and the development of Kalaupapa settlement is an intriguing one, filled with tragedy, compassion, drama, and unusual and often colorful personalities. It is significant in terms of general community values, past and future health research, and the conflict generated between cultural traditions and public health policies. Much of this history is well documented, some is conjectural, and some aspects will never be known or fully understood. Further study should involve oral history from remaining patients, ex-patients, government employees, medical staff, and others who have been involved with the people or the physical development of the settlement. An ethnographic study of contemporary residents might also be useful in documenting this unique segment of Hawai'ian society. 675 HISTORICAL BASE MAPS 677 APPENDIXES 697 - Appendix A 699 - 0 10 701 Appendix B Laws Relating to Leprosy.

It shall be the duty of every police ofiicer or deputy sheriff, having reason to believe that any person within his district is afflicted with leprosy, to report the same forthwith to the agent of the Board of Health in such district, if any, otherwise to the nearest agent of the Board of Health. Any police officer or deputy sheriff who shall wilfully fail to comply with the provisions of the previous section shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction thereof before any district magistrate, shall be fined in a sum not less than ten dollars nor more than two hundred dollars, and shall be dismissed from office, KOKUAS ARE SUBJECT TO THE BOARD. Voluntary helpers or kokuas living with lepers segregated by the Board of Health may be by such Board declared infected with the disease of leprosy, and capable of communicating the same to others. All such kokuas are hereby placed under control of the Board of Health, and may be prevented by it from intermingling with those free from the disease. The Board of Health, with the consent of the governor, is empowered to make and promulgate such rules and regulations in regard to such helpers or kokuas for their care, discipline and mainte- nance as may be deemed necessary, ~vhich rules and regulations shall have the force and effect of law when promulgated. DUTIES OF KOKUAS.

PATSY T. iiN< OF HAWAII IN THE HOUSE OF REPRZSEKTATIVES Monday, December 15, 1375 ~Mrs. MlXK. Mr. Speaker, I am intro- ducing legislation today calling for an immediate study by the Secretary of Interior for a new national historic park at Kalaupapa on the island of Molokai, State of Hawaii. I authored H.R. 12012 in the 93d Congress and House Joint Resolution 220 in this Congress, estab- lishing such a national park. I believe this new study bill will help further the enactment of the national park bill and is needed to provide this congress and the ueople of Ameiica with information on the treasured and historic significance of this area. Kalauuaua may already be known to the Members of this House through the long and dedicated service of a Belgian priest named Father Dan&n, who com- mitted his life to the people of Kalaupapa settlement l l l a colony which was es- tablished more than a century ago for the care and treatment of the victims of leprosy. At its October meeting, the National Advisory Council of the National Park Service approved, endorsed and recom- mended to the Secretary of the Interior that Kalaupapa settlement be designated as a national historic landmark. This recommendation and endorsement fol- lowed a professional evaluation oi the potcntlal historical significance of the peninsula undertaken at my urging. This new bill contains three key cle- ments. First, it authorizes and directs the Secretary of Interior to conduct a sixdy of Kalaupapa. The purpose of this study would be to formulate the basic design of this national park. Second, it creates an advisory com- mission based 111 Hawaii to consuit with the Secretary during the course of this study. This is to assure that local input is had during the early stages of plan- ning. Third, it provides that a proposed master plan for development of the park arca be made part of the Secretary's report. The cape on which the site is located is among the most remote locations in all Hawaii. It is the scene of heroic serv- ice by Father Dnmien and many oLhcrs who came later. As you know, modern mcbhods for treatment of leprosy have since been developed and so today the patient population has dwindled to less than 150 persons. most of whom cur- rently live there by choice, and not by necessity. These persons adamantly re- fuse to leave their homes on Kalaupapa and do not wish to leave under any cir- cumstances. Any study should allow these persons to rcmnin for their lifctimcs. WiLhin 50 years there will bc no more patienLs at Ka:aupaps. It is therefore imperative that this study be authorized now. Time ls of essence. Kalaupapa is a national treasure whose historic sifmlficance Is already noted by the selcctioq of Father Damien as one of the two greatest personages from Hawaii whose statue is in Statuary Hall in the House of Representatives. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to report that this legislation calling for a study of Kalaupapa for national historic park purposes has the support of citizens groups in Hawaii and, most importantly. the concurrence of the resident and staff population of the settlement itself. Through the enactment of this study bill I believe these residents of Kalaupapa will have their best assurance of being allowed to remain there for the rest of their lives. The State of Hawaii has served notice to them that they may be evicted in 10 years, which they are strongly resisting. The State legislature on the other hand, has given numerous assurances to these residents that they could indeed remain. The matter of establishing this historic Peninsula as a park is not at Issue in the legislature. I believe it has overwhelming support. The only issue is whether it should be a national park or a State park. Some of our county leaders and State legislators believe that the State should not give UP any more of its lands to the Federal Goveimment. There is ra- ther widespread opinion that the St.&e park could adequately preserve this area. To enable this matter to be satisfactorily answered, the study called for by my bill will delineate the magnitude of the un- dertaking, the cost for development and the funds needed for restoration and preservation of those sites already heav- ily in disrepair. My bill ~111 also nuthor- ize the preparation of a master plan. This will sup& all of us who seek to have this hi&or&area with better than\"ball park\" figures of the full cost of this undertak- ing. My bill authorizes $150,000 for the preparation of this report.. In view of the historical significant of Kalaupapa. both at the Stabe and na- tlonal levels, I would urge the earliest possible consideration of this legislation. 717 Appendix F Public Law 96-565--Dec. 22, 1980 94 Stat. 3321 Public Law 9GX5 9tm.
