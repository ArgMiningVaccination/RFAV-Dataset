Kathleen Galarneau --- -- : ~~am~ ) iii ABSTRACT A concept of howledge mnopolies, derived from the writings of H.A. Innis and Ivan Illich, is used as a critical tool to analyze the nature of authority that is exercised by mdern medical doctors in Western cultures. The concept's utility is thought to be two-fold: It can add amther dimension of understanding to a sample of historical and sociological literature pertaining to medicine, as well as furnish a basis for discussing the nature of professional authority in terms of mre general cultural criticism. The writings of H.A. Innis suggest that mdern systems of authority, such as the profession of medicine, are based on mnoplies of howledge that grew in relationship to developents in printed comnunication. His communications perspective is adapted to the problein of nodern professional power in general, and medical authority in particular, through Illich's notion of radical monopoly. The works of both writers are discussed separately and then synthesized into a conceptual frame- work for assessing medical authority. The first application of this framemrk is taward an examination of systems of authority in traditional medicine -- defined as the healing arts from antiquity to the close of the Middle Ages. Second, the concept is used to guide a discussion of the growth of modern medicine. Particular emphasis is placed on the invention of the printing press in the fifteenth century. The survey concludes at the outset of the twentieth century where systems of authority in traditional and mdern medicine are sham to be almost parallel. By v-e of the way in which medical knowledge was mompolized in the &ern era, it is argued that scientific doctors exercise pwrs that are unprecedented in the history of Western medicine. The conclusion endeavours to appmise the utility of the monopoly concept, arguing that it can be a useful analytical guide to understanding the nature of professional authority in modern medicine. It can serve to organize a sample of historical and sociological material in a new way. In so doing, the concept permits the student of social change to step outside the details of formal medical delivery systems, and examine the problem of authority within a wider context of the history of systems and institutions responsible for the organization and contt?ol of professional knowledge as a whole.

No wonder the patient is in deep trouble. viii Beginning in the nineteenth century, journalists, politicians, intellectuals, and patients, sang praises for modern medicine. The white lab coat and stethoscope became symbols for the triumph of science in the service of humankind. Later, in this century, an upbeat tune was inter- rupted by occasional discords. \"Many treatments are hazardous to your health.\" \"The health care bureaucracy is too expensive and dehumanizing.\" l'Consumers have no choice but to suhnit to professional authority or be abandoned during times of personal crises.\" Thus, in the past few decades, we have begun to appeciate that, despite undeniable advances, modern medicine has failed to satisfy us in significant ways. This thesis is the result of my efforts to understand the nature of medical authority from the vantage point of its relationship to canmunications media; to assess the ways that communication confines both the producers and consumers of medical knowledge. I chose not to deal with sociological, economic, and political details of &ern medical practice. Rather, I looked at the relationship of comnications media to systems of authority throughout the history of Westerm medicine. The idea of examining a medical authority in relationship to media came to me while reading Harold Innis' work regarding the history of communication. In light of his perspective, I came to regard the history of Western civilization as a series of epochs that have came and gone in relationship to particular media and the ways in which they were used to impart order and meaning. As I began to reflect on the achievements and failures of ancient, medieval, and modern cultures, in terms of the organization of knowledge, I discovered that major 'transition points in medical histmy matched patterns that Innis found in larger, cultural, historical contexts. These findings led me to believe that the problem of authority in contemporary medical practice is, in effect, a small- scale version of the problem of knowledge in Western civilization, and that printed communication is cenlral to understanding how medical kmwledge was monopolized by mdern doctors. While choosing Innis' c~m~nunications perspective as the primary guide to assessing the nature of authority, I required a complementary theory to adapt his ideas to modern medical practice. It was at this point that I turned to Ivan Illich's concept of radical monopoly. He maintains that doctors exercise a monopoly over the creation and satis- faction of medical needs in indus-trial societies. Their monopoly is a radical one because patients canmt order the production of alternative needs and sources of satisfaction. His writings are rich with examples of how professional authority is maintained and extended through education, patient referral systems, drug control programs, ideology, and other market mechanisms. Thus, I fused Illich's concept of radical monopoly with Innis' kmwledge monopoly concept to form the conceptual framework for this thesis. It is the wide angle lens that enabled me to frame and fix a multifaceted subject for analysis. Part One of the thesis begins with an overview of Innis' history of relationships between cmunication, mnopoly, and the organization of knowledge. This is followed by an explication of Illich's critique of professional power in contemporary cultural contexts. Both writers are shown to be canplementary in terms of had they perceive the nature of power and how they conceive of ideal systems of authority. These pages provide a conceptual frammrk that guides my a~lysis of tradi- tional and modern medical systems. Part Tho is a brief sumnary of selected aspects of the history of traditional medicine. Traditional healing is examined in terms of institutional medical systems in West- civilization during periods when comnication was based on media such as clay, stone, papyrus, and whment. While Innis' cunmunications perspective is used to structure this survey, the medical material is drawn fram historians like Erwin Ackerknecht, Frederick Cartwright, W.J. Reader, Vern Bullough, and Henry Sigerist. This part concludes with an assessment of the nature of authority in traditional systems of healing. Part Three is an examination of the birth of modern medicine and its maturation into a dominant profession. European doctors and their acquisition of monopolistic privileges, are assessed in relationship to developments in printed comnunication from the fifteenth to the turn of the twentieth century. The nature of rmdern medical authority is discussed with reference to the work of sociologists such as Eliot Friedson, kgali Larson, Elliott &awe, and Terence Johnson. Traditional and modern systems of medical authority are sbwn to be adogous in I some respects while diverging in one significant way. It is argued that the important difference between traditional and modern authority stems fm print-related processes that underscore the way that mderm medical howledge was mmplized. It should be noted that Parts ?t;o and Three are not presented as medical history or sociology but, rather, as another way of approaching the problem of authmity in modern medicine. I believe that the monopoly collcept frames some historical antecedents that seem to explain, what many sociologists agree to be, the symptams of contemporary medical malaise. My amlysis stops short of tracing twentieth century developents in medicine. Rather, it suggests that current systems of authority were founded on print-related factors. Thus, for those who are concerned about the nature of professional authority in current medical practice, the following pages also suggest that future reform may mise from the ways that more recent cmunication technologies are used to produce knowledge. PART ONE TEE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK PART ONE : INTRODUCTION For anyone who has undertaken even a cursory reading of Harold Innis and Ivan Illich, the question might aptly arise: What do these two writers hold in cmon and why have they been selected as the major sources far this thesis? This question could stem, first, from an aware- ness of variations in style. For example, Innis entreats his readers to meander through 'snips' of history ad to entertain the idea that systems of power, based on particular media, have shaped the contours of know- ledge in Western civilization. In terms of style, Innis is a scholar who discusses new ideas while never being dogmatic or attempting closure. Illich, on the other hand, is like an oracle who pulls his readers along a straight line of reasoning. He exhibits a kind of intolerance for those who might fail to grasp his very specific, and at times, dogmatic critique of contemporary Western society. Another point of disparity between Innis and Illich lies in approaches taken to the problem of knowledge. Innis uses communications media as the key to understanding achievements and failures of cultures throughout recorded history. Illich does mt speak of cornmnication technology pet be, but is concerned with a full range of tools that we use to satisfy needs. Unlike Innis, he tends to be off-handish about Western history prior to industrialization, preferring instead, to puncute his critiques of contemporary society with personal observa- tions fram the field of Latin hrican development. When he includes references to ancient and medieval history, it is mre by way of illus- trating the strengths of bygone epochs and the limitations of indus-trial societies. This is in contrast to Innis who treats particular historical periods in tkir awn right. Incompatibilities between Innis and Illich, in terms of style and approach, recede into the background when one considers the positions held in cammon. ?hey regard the monopolization of knowledge as the principle dilemma facing modern society. They both argue that authority should, ideally be vested in every person as opposed to being rigidly stratified according to institutional divisions. Furthemre, they maintain that -this ided is attainable when knowledge is produced and shared in the absence of monopoly. In my mind, the comept of kmwledge monopolies, as drawn from the writings of Innis and Illich, represents a useful theoretical guide to understanding the nature of authority in modern mdicine. Part One, therefore, is devoted to explaining and defining the concept. Chapter One is my interpretation of what Innis means by monopolies of knowledge. Chapter Tho is concerned with Illich's use of the term radical monopoly, and how professional groups in general, and medicine in particular, utilize monopolistic power to confine human action. In the conclusion to this part, I endeavour to synthesize the major ideas Innis and Illich hold in cmmn, so that the ~ader will possess the same lens that guided my reading of selected texts in medical sociology ad history. H .A. IMS : COMMUNICATIONS AND ?HE MONOPOLY OF KNoWEEGE CONCEPT In my opinion, interdisciplinary mrk does not mean the meeting of specialists in different disciplines, but rather the meeting of different disciplines in the same individual -- an adventure that our system discourages, when it does not ab~~l~telyf~~bid it. Lucien Israel, M.D. . 'I'his chapter opens with an introduction to Innis' personal and academic background. Then, the subject of communications media, which is ceneal to his approach to understanding the relationship between knowledge and power, is discussed. This is followed by a discussion of the 'bias of cammunication' which is a prelude to the section where the concept of kmwledge monopolies is defixd. The chapter concludes with a look at what Innis believes to be the implications of knowledge mono- plies for mdern Western culture. INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT H.A. Innis was one of CaMda's mst eminent scholars. Despite his premature death in 1952, he left a valuable collection of insights and interdisciplinary research for students of social change to draw upon. Born on an Ontario farm in 1894, Innis was raised according to the strict canons of the Baptist faith and the demands of routine farm labour. Donald Creighton, a personal friend and colleague of Innis, remarks that a rural and religious background instilled a s-trong sense of dignity, independence, and self-sufficiency in the young Innis. Creighton also notes that World War I had a significant effect on Innis and it is perhaps mst revealing in terms of the latter's underlying concern with the nature of authority in society. Crei@ton expresses Innis' views about the War in the following way: In his view, noncombatants were simply bureaumats who risked mthing and battened on the War's emoluments of money, prestige, and power. Bureau- cracy meant regimentation ard centralization and all the other evils of big government, which Innis instinctively hated. (2) This attitude permeates Innis' scblarly work in which he documents the consequences of centralized power in relationship to economic and cultural activity. As far as he is concerned, centralized authority leads to exploitation of natural and/or human resources. While attending Mc&ster University, Innis became lcnown for his 3 debating skills, which led him to contemplate a career in law. Upon completion of a Master of Arts degree in 1918, this plan was overruled in favour of studying at the University of Chicago. It was here that Innis expanded his intellectual base through exposure to Thorstein Veblen's evolutionary theory of economic development, G.H. Mead's emphasis on language in individual development, and Robert Park's concern with cultural ~onditionin~.~ Innis obtained a Ph.D. in Chicago and returned to the University of Toronto in 1920 where he began teaching economics. For the next twenty years, he taught and wrote under the rubric of 'economic geographer1. He is well known for his mrk on Canadian economic history, represented by the following books : A History of the Canadian Pacific Railway, 1923; The F'ur Trade in Canada, 1930; Cod Fisheries: The History of an International Economy, 1940; and Essays in Canadian Economic History, 1956. In these works, he addressed the problem of regional developent in Canada. His primary concern was with developments in natural resource industries. His research led him to conclude that econmic instability results when the production ad distribution of \\-- _ staple + - ----- resQmes, in marginal areas, is contralled fm the centres of It was not until after World War I1 that Innis turned his attention to the problem of knowledge and culture. He extended the economic theory of mmpoly to include systems of power that shape the contours of - knowledge in Western civilization. This shift in emphasis, often referred to as Innis' second phase, is well represented by two books: hpire and Camunications, 1950 ; and The Bias of Communication, 1951. 6 These volumes are used as the primary sources for the discussion that follows are are referenced in the text by the abbreviations mire and Bias respectively. Much has been written about Innis' unique approach to economic and . cultural history, but perhaps one of the more succinct statements is offered by William Kuhns: \"Innis has attempted reading history through foms rather than content, through information flow and control rather than political hems, wars, and trade. ''7 Innis, as econanic geographer, traced the source and routes of staple econcanies and Innis, as cultural historian, documented the \"source and route of new forms of power and authority. \"* The systems of authority that concerned him, were those - -- -- - -- --- - that emanated from various cmunications technology and related uses. COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY Despite the centrality of communications technology to Innis' work, he does not provide a precise definition for the word 'media'. Neverthe- less, one can extract a workable definition of the term by examining \" For example, (Empire, 81) or (Bias, 15 are used in place of stan- dard footraotes~is and subsequent chapters. The nmbers refer to pages where the qmte and/or idea appears. particular epochs in Western history, which Innis distinguishes according - ____-4- to expires m systems of power that were founded on unique systems of _comnunication. For example, he regards the development of cuneiform writing on clay tablets as a principle dynamic in the rise of religious hierarchies in Babylonian and Assyrian cultures (Bias, 6 ) . Similarly, Egyptian priesthoods acquired pwer through the use of a complex form of writing with brushes and papyrus (Bias, 7). On the other hand, Innis links the rise of Christianity to Latin scholars writing with stylus and parc'nment codex (Empire, 109 . kmn these and other examples, it is clear 3Aat Innis' use of the term 'ccmnunications media' embraces three dimensions: (1) the arti- facts associated with cmunication; (2) organizational factors pertaining to the production and distribution of messages; and (3) implications for the character of kmwledge. These dimensions are illustrated in the case of ancient Babylonian and Assyrian cultures. First, clay and the reed stylus were the instruments used to produce official records and/or to strengthen collective memry. Secondly, priests monopolized the requisite artifacts and expertise to produce howledge. Temples, in essence, were the training grounds, production houses, and libraries for important docmnts. The clergy's control over writing enabled organized religion to exercise a high degree of authority within city-states. And, thirdly, religious influence on the character of knowledge was evidenced by a cultuml preoccupation with ritual, astromy, astrology, and a belief in fate (Bias, 6). --- < /- - - - - -. - -- - - The problem of authority is at the heart of Innis' use of the term 'media' . He regards cmunication as the fundamental activity in any culture and is, therefore, concerned with religious and/or secular pups who control the instruments of cdcation. While it is important to stress that Innis is not a technological deterministg he does argue that communications media underscore the evolution of systems of authority: Pkdia give rise to pmer; they point to mechanisms that serve to maintain power; and, they can be enlisted to offset or destroy entrenched authority. Sociologist, Liora Salter, clarifies this point in the following quote: Technology is viewed as an extension of activity: it is instrumental. Wce the activity of which it is a part, technology is grourded in specific social and economic conditions; it is tied to relations of production, kinds of markets, and vested political and economic interests. Techm- logical systems function as an integral part of production, are developed to meet the needs of specific forms of production, and contribute to the maintenance of control. At the same time, they can be used as weapons of resistance. (10) Thus, media, regardless of design, can be used tmard different ends, depending upon their relationship to the cultural milieu. Innis found that what people 'knmt &cut the world is largely determined by interconnections between political, economic, social, and psychological factors, as these components of culture pivot mud the dominant medium of cmunication. In -ire and Bias, he presents the reader with a variety of cmunication systems or combinations of these factors. To expedite an understanding of the significance of media to the history of civilization, it is best to forego lengthy descriptions of unique comunication systems and proceed with a breakdown into two general types. In the first type, people derive meanings through traditional patterns of interaction where thereis an emphasis on religion and continuity with the past. Innis refers to these kinds of cultures as being 'bound to the demands of time. ' In the second type, knowledge is negotiated through processes that favour secular concerns such as economic and military expansion and the pursuit of novelty. Cultures, in this latter category, are 'bound to the demnds of space.' Whether or not a culture is considered to be time-bound or space-bound is dependent upon the bias of cdcations media. THE BIAS OF COMMUNICATION Bias, in communication and culture, operates on several levels, but it begins wifh people. Human cammunication is, essentially, the activity of using our senses to access information and to process or, literally, to 'make sense' of experience. ?he significant outcomes of this continuous process is that we use derivative meanings to act in the world and to solve pmblens (Bias, 85). Innis expresses a preference for om1 comunication and/or systems of writing that are easily adapted to everyday speech (Bias, 4). He argues that, when language is spoken, people tend to employ a full range of sensory information to appraise and solve problems. In other words, individuals mke decisions on the basis of what they see, hear, feel, taste, and smell. l1 The advantage of face-to-face communication is that we can trust the authority of our own senses to experience and know the world. In so doing, we are less likely to be rendered dependent upon others who might prefer to do the Wing for us. The appeal of writing rests with its capacity to compensate for the limitations of human mmry . However, the problan with writing is that it can overtake the authority of spoken cammunication (Bias, - 101). With but a few exceptions, Innis found the history of the West to be punc- tuated with comnunication systems that confined individual freedom of thought and action; where external sources of knowledge overpmered people's authority to negotiate reality through the use of langauge in direct connection with sensory experience. In each case, external sources of authority are related to the biases of complex writing sys terns. The bias of comnication stems fram qualities that are inherent to the medium that writing is based upon: Media that emphasize tk are those that are durable in character, such as parchment, clay, ad stone. The heavy materials are suited to the development of architecture and sculpture. Media that emphasize space are apt to be less durable and li@t in character, such as papyrus ad paper. ?he latter are suited to wide areas in administration and trade. Materials that emphasize time favour decentralization and hierarchical types of institutions, while those that emphasize space favour cen-tzalization and systems of government less hierarchical in'character (Empire, 7). - Thus, comnunication and culture are likely to be biased in favour of time if the dominant medium is of a durable or permanent material. Temporally-biased mdia tend to confer power to religious hierarchies. Conversely, if the dominant medium is easily conveyed, and samewhat fragile in nature, the resulting bias of comunication will be a spatial one. Spatially-biased mdia lend themselves to monopolization by secular pups and cenwalized power. Both biases exhibit strengths and weaknesses with respect to the probability that a culture will flourish or be stable. For example, temporally-biased cultures satisfy the need for tradition and s-trong social bonds between people, while spatially-biased cultures satisfy the need for explorations into new geographical and intellectual terrain. Few cultures, thmughout history, have enjoyed the benefits of change without the threat of social disintegration, or experienced the security of established cmunity life, without an accompanying sense of boredom and rigid adherence to precedent (Bias, 90). Furthemre, the more extreme the bias of communication, in favour of time and at the expense of space, or vice versa, the m-re difficult it is to correct before the culture declines. In this respect, cmunication is the keystone of culture, and the latter is most stable when the biases of time and space are balanced. Innis reveres classical Grecian culture because its members demn- strated an ability to \"appraise problems in terms of t& and space\" (Bias, 85). In other words, the eeeks maintained the benefits of tradition, while reaching out of relative geographical and cultural isolation, and returning with novel ideas and artifacts for adaptation to their own needs (Bias, 40, 136). Similarly, they achieved an optimum relationship between autonomous and institutional authority, through a unique system of cmunication based on speech. Innis argues that a strong oral -tradition, and an alphabet that was easily adapted to writing in the vernacular, enabled the Greeks to excel artistically, scientifically, socially, and politically. An 'appeal to the ear' in cmunicatim provided a persistent check against the formation of knowledge rnonopolies.12 This means that an emphasis on speech facilitated a cultural system of authority, independent of force. Empowered officials had the means of establishing guidelines for religious, ecodc, social, and political action, but, at the same time, they were responsive to the need for continuously adjusting stan- dards in light of new information (Bias, 42). Classical Greece was, in Innisr mind, a culture in which institutional authority existed in the absence of force: rlThe individual became responsible for his actions and the mot of authority was destroyedr1 (Bias, 42). l3 1n short, mete, during its classical period, was a stable or ideal culture. MONOPOLIES OF KNOWLFDGE: DEFINED Many scholars subdivide the historical landscape into periods of war and peace, or into decades and centuries. Innis does not conform to the customary methods of chronological sequencing, but rather, orders history according to empires as they developed and declined in relationship to one another ad the dominant mode of comnication they employed. An empire, like classical Greece, is a culture that exhibits a flexible interplay between competing forms of cmunication. A balance between time and space enabled Grecian cultux to achieve stability. However, empires are often biased in favour of time at the expense of space or vice versa. In such empires, one form of comnunication dominates cultural activity, to the point where the empire becanes a rigid system of pmer. The result is cultural instability and, ultimately, the empire declines in the face of the bias of communication. The source of this instability, or rigidity, is found by examining monopolies of lawledge that have grown in relation to the dominant medium of cmunication. Or, as Salter indicates : bnopoly and empire could be seen as tm perspec- tives on the same phenmenon. If empire was the institutionalization of power, monopoly represen- ted the nature and means of contra1 exerted. (14) In this respeot, Innis' notion of knowledge monopolies is the key to tracing the source of cultural instability, and to understanding the nature of authority that operates in rigid systems of power. Monopolies of knowledge, despite differences on the surface, share three characteristics: (1) They are built on, and their cmunication depends upon, the restriction of communication to one dominant medium. (2) They tie knowledge to specific interests and, in so doing, de-value other ways of laowing about the world. (3) They enable favoured groups to exercise rigid control over the product ion and mvanent of informat ion. For example, an empire that is entrenched in a tmporal bias of communi- cation, tends to be suppo~ed by monopolies that are built on durable media such as stone, clay, and parchment. Historically, religious groups have built powerful hiemhies on the basis of sacred texts that were written on durable media. They authorized knowledge that was concerned with providence and ancbred spiritual beliefs to moral law. Painting, music, architecture, and rituals that 'appealed to the ear1 reflected organized religions1 cone01 over cultural activity. 15 While different in substance, a spatially-biased empire displays the same underlying elements as its time-bound counterpart. It is founded on a dominant medium of cammunication, which is, in this case, papyrus, paper, or other materials that are easily conveyed. bnopolies tend to cluster around forms of cammunication such as textbooks where, historically, markets for these products have been forged through concanitant innovations in road construction, shipping, and other 16 developents in transportation. Spatially-biased forms of cdca- tion facilitate standardization in knowledge by lending a quantitative character to information, and by increasing the possibility that communities, in hitherto geographically isolated locations, receive the same information as those in the centres of civilization. These conditions foster a preoccupation with civil law, and confer centralized power to governments, entrepreneurs, and professional classes. bnopolies of knowledge begin with innovations in codcations technology that generally emerge fm the margins of culture -- fram groups that are geopaphically and/or sociologically distanced from the loci of power. Furthmre, the cmpetitive strength of new forms of cmunication, rests with their capacity to offset the limitations of the dominant comunication system. For example, during the reign of Augustus, papyrus was the dcPninant medium that had facilitated Rome's imperial expansion and centralized power ('Empire, 108). In this spatially-biased empire, lands and people had been united politically, but the need for what Innis calls 'individual salvation' had been neglected (Einpire, 108). Parchment, which was economical, convenient, and durable, proved to be an innovation that enabled Christians to compete against other religions to satisfy the needs for redemptive religion, and to eventually overtake secular Roman rule (mire, 109 . The same principle was in operation when the Christian empire reached a point of rigidity or instability. The Church's temporal mnopoly paved the way fm campeting forms of comunication that could correct the need for novelty. \"The limitations of culture, in point of duration, are in part a result of the inability to muster the intellec- tual resources of a people to the pint where stagnation can be avoided. and where boredam can be evaded\" (Bias, 133). Paper was a corrective for the predicament of knowledge and culture. To this effect, Innis writes : A monopoly over time invited competition such as tht which followed a spread in the use of paper from China through the Mohammedans at Bagdad and Cordova and in the recognition of new sources of learning, notably in Greek science and philosophy represented especially by Aristotle filtered through Arabia or caning direct fram Constan- tinople. (17) n7 forms af cmunication that were based on paper, satisfied the need to explore novel areas in howledge, while, simultaneously, re~enching Latin as the official language and revitalizing literature written in the vermacular. Later, during the Renaissance, developments in print technology served to extirpate the roots of the church's power. Ironically, monopolies of knmledge originate when an alternative medium of cmunication presents the possibility for marginal groups to correct cultural instability that results when an empire has evolved into a rigid system of power. However, as the groups who control new forms of cmunication begin to consolidate their interests, new systems of power begin to emerge. In effect, mnopolies of knmledge, during their infancy, represent a check against rigid power, but when mature, monopolies support another but equally rigid system of power. The history of Western civilization, fmn Innis' perspective, resembles a pendulum that swings from one bias of ccsnmunication to another; from one anpire to another; and from one configuration of knowledge monopolies to another. Ideally, the pendulum should oscillate only slightly at a central point between two extreme biases of time and space. But balance of this nature is difficult for cultures to achieve and maintain. This is the case, because the strengths of a new medium of communication usher it from the margins to the centre of cultural activity. It is not until monopolies of knowledge have grown up around the medium that its limitations beg for correction. However, it is difficult to assess the limitations of cmunication because individuals cannot escape the bias that confines thought and action in their own culture (Ehpire, 9) (Bias, 133). Thus monopolies of howledge resist correction until the empire that they support is threatened by instability. The result is cultural decline and another swing of the pendulum. IMPLICATIONS FOR CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY Innis devotes a large portion of his writings to a transition period in Western history, when the church's time-bound empire was over- taken by monopolies of knowledge that grew in relation to innovations in paper and print technology -- when printed forms of c~cation dis- placed the authority of sacred manuscripts. This transition began in the fiteenth century, in conjunction with the invention of the printing press, ad was, more or less, consolidated late in the nineteenth century, after pow was applied to the printing press and wood-based paper had been manufactured (Bias, 3). While Innis' work includes developments in more recent media such as cinema and radio, I chse to limit this discussion to the period beginning with the Renaissance, and concluding at the turn of the twentieth century. My cbice is based on an assumption that the systems of powr that characterize contemporary Western society can be traced to developments associated with printed cammunication prior to the twentieth century. Furthemre, I assume tlat medicinet s current monopoly of knowledge can also be -traced to printed forms of cmuni- cation that erged during this transition Innis stresses print-related changes in education, perhaps because institutional learning is intimately bound to the processes that shape the character of kmwledge. lXlring Western Europe's period of modernization, education was transformed fram a closed circle of religious scholars into a large-scale secular enterprise. As the production of howledge shifted from dictation and hand copying to mechanical and commercial printing processes, so too did the character of howledge change. The church's mphasis on spiritual needs and a concern for preserving traditional knowledge, gave way to a spatial bias that emphasized natural science and a preoccupation with the future (Bias, 76). i\" Fmm this pint forward, I shall refer to this period of transi- tion as the modernization of Western civilization. bnopolies clustered around printed fom of cmunication such as textbooks, newspapers, and learned journals. As more and more people learned to read, they also learned to need scientific information about the world. Innis refers to these needs as 'demands for the miraculous1: To supply this demand for the miraculous has been a highly renurnerative task, as is evidenced by the publications of firms concerned with scientific wor ks.... Popular literature explained the wonders of the physical world and at the same time flushed the imaginations of men with the consciousness that they were living the era 'Iwhi&, in itself vastly superior to any age of the past, need be burdened by no fear of decline or catastrophe but, trusting in the boundless resources of science, might surely defy fate\" (Bias, 192). Science, in effect, captured the public imagination during mdernization and prevails at the expense of generating and satisfying needs in non- comnercial ways. The strength of printed forms of cmunication is their capacity to standardize information (Bias, 18). Because &ern scientists are concerned with objective knowledge, print suits the needs of scientific inquiry more perfectly than media that preceded it.\"; The fact that science produces objective, or what Innis calls \"mechanized howledge\", is not a bad thing in itself (Bias, 195). The problem, from Innis' point of view, is that Western people have become 'obsessedt with science and that otheu, ways of knowing about the world have been de- valued (Bias, 193 1 .I8 Because of print-related links between government, industry, and education, there are few institutional mechanisms that It will be argued, in Chapter Three, that science has inherited an objective method largely because of print-related factors. support knowledge that cannot be justified in terms of econcknic and military expansion (Bias, 193-1951. Thus, modernization led to the growth of empires that are rigidly biased in favour of space. Mono- plies of knowledge, founded on the bias of print technology, support and extend these empires at the expense of knmledge that satisfies needs associated with time. The lesson that I derive frm Innis is that contemporary Western nations have not escaped the dilerrana that beset other cultures through- out history. Problems and/or needs are defined an3 satisfied through rigid institutional processes. The high priests of knowledge are now research scientists and consulting professionals. Coctors, lawyers, engineers, economists, and other special occupational groups have inherited key positions in the current scheme of things. They are empmerd to protect and extend monopolistic privilege over the activities that govern the production and satisfaction of needs. In so doing, professions, such as medicine, nourish empires thxt are entrenched in a spatial bias of cmunication -- a bias that threatens the stability of Western cultures. 21 FOOTNOTES TO CHAPTER ONE lbnald Creighton, \"Harold Adams Innis -- An Appraisal\".

IVAN ILLICH: PROFESSIONAL MONOPOLY AND POWER IN INDUSTRIAL socrzn ... the professions bring knowledge to the service of power. . . . A.M. Carr-Saunders and P.A. Wilson This chapter is an explication of Ivan Illich's critique of indus- trial society with particular emphasis on professional monopolies of knowledge and their place in contemporary systems of power. First, his academic life and career are,highlighted. Then the discussion turns to haw professions, especially medicine, dominate the creation and satis- faction of needs in industrial countries. This is followd by an examination of the role that science plays in mdern society. The con- cluding section includes Illich's ideas on technology and the way it is used by professional groups to maintain and extend their authority. INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT Ivan Illich lived his first fifteen years in Vienna until his family was expelled by Nazi occupiers in 1941. The following two years were filled with studies in ~tural sciemes and psychology at the University of Florence. In 1943 he began classes at the Gregorian University, in Rome, where he obtained degrees in philosophy and theology. His formal education was completed with a doctoral degree in history, at the University of Salzburg in 1951. Illich's interest in the 'roots of knowledge' was apparent when he 1 was a student but his concern with 'kmwledge and power' crystallized when he entered the priesthood. After four years serving as an Assistant Pastor of Incarnation Church in Manhattan, Illich began to speak out against the Catholic Church and otheu, institutio~lized religions. He was critical of what he called a 'dominating and disabling influence' that organized religion exercised in Anerican cammunities; pmticularly with refereme to the influx of Puerto Rican immigrants to New York's inner city . 2 In 1956, Illich was assigned to the position of Vice Rector of the Catholic University of Ponce, Puerto Rico, where he obtained funding to open a centre to train incaning missionaries. The Intercultural Centre of Cocurnentation (CIDOC) was founded in 1961 in Cuernavaca, Mexico. The curriculum consisted of courses in the Spanish language, social sciences, and humanities, with an emphasis on challenging the students' cherished beliefs. Illich's central message to the missionaries, according to a writer in Current Biography: was an exhortation to root out of themselves Western political biases, ethnocentric values, and paternalistic attitudes that would align them with the status quo in a social and econadc system that desperately needs changing. (3) The CIDOC message, coupled with the publication of Illich's articles recammending a de-politicized and de-bureaucratized church, resulted in a major ecclesiastical con-hversy. It led to a Vatican order forbid- ding priests, nuns, and other members of the church fmm studying in Cuernavaca. The end result was a secularization of the centre in 1968 and Illichls renunciation of his priestly functions in 1969. Pgart from his on-going involvement with CIDOC, Illich is author six books: &schooling Society, 1971; Tools for 1973; Energy and EQuity, 1974; Limits to Medicine, 1976; and Toward a History of Needs, 1977. The theme that unites each volume is Illich's concern with the institutionalization of knowledge ad implications for personal and cultural determination. The books that serve as primary sources for this discussion are Tools for Conviviality, 4 6 Limits to Medicine, and Toward a History of Needs. They are referenced in this and later chapters by the abbreviations Tools, Limits and Needs respectively. :': While Illich considers his research into compulsory schooling to be a model for assessing the problem of knowledge and authority in contem- pomry society, he extends his analysis to embrace other areas such as health, welfare, transportation, national defense, and energy (Tools, xxii) . He argues that these, and other important public needs, are defined and satisfied by professional elites who mnoplize howledge. THE CREATION AND SATISFACTION OF NEEDS An outstanding feature of industrial societies is the proliferation of specialists who dominate the activity of creating and satisfying needs. Tnrough various mechanisms, these groups preside over the definition of important problems as well as the implementation of solutions. Despite differences on the surface, the substance of various professional groups is the same; they are a special force in the industrial mode of production. Professions are unique because they exercise a 'radical mmpoly' over the focal activities of society. Illich defines radical monopoly as: I ... the dominance of one type of product rather than the dominance of one brand. I speak about radical mnopoly when one industrial production process exercises an exclusive control over the satisfaction of a pressing need, and excludes non- industrial activities from competition (Tools, 52). + For example, (Limits, 56 indicates that the quote and/or idea appears on page 56 in the book entitled Limits to Medicine. Professionals differ from others who provide a service or product because tky have acquired the authority to both determine needs and to be the only groups permitted to satisfy them. In educational spheres, for example, the need 'to lean' is -transposed into the need 'to get an education1. Learning, which is an intrinsic activity or a by-product of everyday living, becomes a cmdity or institutional package in the professional equation (Needs, 70). Learning is re-defined to mean that which is acquired in schools -- the latter being the workshops or the places where 'what is worth learning' is packaged. 7 Not only do professional groups have the authority to create and minister to needs, they also have the legal sanctions to determine the rationale for mandatory consumption of their services. Through a claim to incommunicable lamledge, professionals can define people as clients with particular needs and in so doing, create new social roles. * Illich maintains that the authority to do this does not come from the population at large, but rather, he says, \"a profession, like a priesthood, holds power by concession fram an elite whose interests it pmps up\" (Needs, 24). A concession of this nature is possible only in societies where knowledge has been mnopolized. Wrticians are an interesting example of a group that was granted the concession to mve from rerely supplying a service to a group capable of creating needs. At the turn of the twentieth century, grave- diggers acquired the outward appemces of a profession by changing their title, establishing a set of academic credentials, and by 'educating1 the public about hygienic standards pertaining to burial. But the ultimate criterion required for admission to the professional class occurred at the point when it became illegal to be buried indepen- dently of their services. 9 Of all the occupational gmps that have acquired professional status, medicine is the mst domimnt. A measure Illich uses for this is the frequency of the patient role. Almost all people in industrialized societies 'need' to be patients at one time or amther. Our dependence on institutional medical care reshapes the cultural milieu by, in his mrds, \"appropriating those of its general characteristics which have enabled people to so far cope on their own\" (Limits, 50). This is accomplished on a clinical level when diagnostic and treatment proce- dures replace or undermine the body's ~tural ability to heal itself (Limits, 30-41 . Clinical iatrogenesis2\\ is compounded and reinforced by the social organization of medicine which creates new demands for a consuming public, rendering the medical system as a principle economic activity and converting self-care into a felony (Limits, 47-52). The result is a public that is oriented toward, and fascinated by, ex-tra- ordinary medical intervention, and what Illich calls a \"need for the engineering of miracles\" ( Limits, ll3-114 . If the ~erception of ignorance is converted to a need for formal education, and if the experience of pain is interpreted as a need for medical intervention, what are the historical precedents to these trans- formations? Illich argues that they are developments unique to indus- trialization: \"For the first time, needs have become almost exclusively coterminous with commodities\" (Needs, 13). Professional domination 3( bctor-inflicted injuries. overrules the need and/or capacity of individuals to educate and care for themselves: Exchange-values replace use-values in an unprecedented fashion. 10 Institutional processes dominate the creation and satisfaction of pressing needs to such an extent that professional services begin to undermine the health and well-being of the consuming public. This paradoxical and counterproductive situation is legitimized, \"...through appeal to the expertise of an elite whose knowledge, by its very nature, cannot be shared1' (Needs, 13). When, for example, people are adversely affected by particular medical technologies1' there are two imnediate solutions to this problem. The first is to limit or stop the use of harmful procedures and the second is to step up professional intervention to manage the crisis. Clinical iatrogenesis, in the latter response, becomes a new need that requires further intervention to be satisfied. It is often the solution that is imposed by the profession, even if experts and laypeople agree that it contradicts 'common sense'. This type of imposition is legitimized on the basis of scientific knowledge, at the expense of cormn hawledge, and at the risk of counterproductive outcomes. Illich maintains that the way we use language contributes to the escalation of health-denying needs and corresponding solutions in industrial and developing nations alike. He defines cultures as \\ I I programs for activities\" and regards language as fundamental for such programs (Needs, 9). But, like other intrinsic activities such as learning and healing, speaking is used to serve cmercial interests : \"The sounds made by the editors and announcers of programmed texts, daily pervert the wds of the spoken language into building blocks for packaged messages\" (Needs, 5). Whenever consumer messages are seen and heard, the greater the likelihood that people think in terms of commodities as needs. Mass media serves the producers of industrial goods and services by creating new markets in locations where such needs would never have otherwise arisen. The standardization of needs is another factor that requires our dependency on professional expertise. Our experience of lacking some- thing, expressed as a need for something, is, in Illich's mrds, \"The fodder on which professions fattened into dominance\" (Needs, 30). The label 'needy' has been broken into special categories, so that individuals fm all socio-economic classes are included as actual or potential markets for professional services. 12 The process of standardization has extended the range of profes- sional intrusion into hitherto taboo areas of social life. This is illustrated by recent controversies regarding sex education in the schools. Venereal disease and adolescent pregnancies were defined as problems, but before these problems could be mnaged through professional channels, they had to be defined in terms of needs. Standardization transposed these problems into a 'need' for more-education. l3 1n this, and other examples, the public has fought against professional domina- tion over the definition of deviance and the prescription of remedies. Hawever, in most cases, the burden of proof in professional-lay controversies rests with those who possess scientific knowledge, thus enfeebling lay resistance to professional management. THE BURDEN OF PROOF Illich maintains that professional domimtion is legitimated on the basis of scientific knowledge. Proof of the rightness or wrongness of professional action rests with the rules that govern the production of scientific howledge. The cognitive nexus between medical practice and scientific research implies that the definition and satisfaction of needs, in clinical settings, has become an extension of the laboratory. Thus, Illich writes that modern medicine: has becore an orthodox apparatus of bureaucratic administrators who apply scientific principles and methods to whole categories of medical cases. In other words, the clinic has turned into a laboratory. By claiming predictable outcomes without considering the hmn performance of the healing person ad his integration in his m social group, the modern physician has assured the traditional posture of the quack (Limits, 255). Links between research and practice refocusses the physician's primary responsibility away frun the client and toward science and/or the profession. Given this arrangement, what constitutes effective or ineffective treabnent is defined according to written medical standards. l4 nese standards do not emanate from lay circles nor do they develop through professional-lay interaction. Rather, their source is the experimental method of science, which is the agreed upon approach to problem-solving within research circles. Regardless then, of treabnent outcomes, such as cure, further impairment, death, or no change, professional conduct is considered to be correct, so long as tk doctor has followed scien- tific rules. For these reasons, Illich suggests that physicians require a high tolerance for cognitive dissonance to permit them to perform dual roles of healer and scientist (Limits, 256). Illich does not take issue with science in and by itself. The problem with science arises when its social function is examined. It is used to determine the nature of professional practices and serves, at the same time, to legitimate orthodox procedures. In so doing, it is the means whereby other ways of defining and satisfying needs are de- legitimated: \"By denying public recognition to entities that cannot be measured by science, the call for pure, orthodox, confirmed medical practice shields this practice from all political evaluation\" (Limits, 257). Science, used in this fashion, provides unprecedented protection to governing elites and, in so doing, presents a formidable barrier to the uninitiated who wish to participate more directly in the satis- faction of pressing needs. Illich contends that the breakdown of this barrier involves a radical change in the design and use of mdern technology. TECHNOLOGY AND MONOPOLY Illich argues that some technologies are predisposed to enrich life, while others are not. The dual function of tools derives partially from their design and prtially from social arrangements in which they are employed. If technologies and their uses enhance autonomous control, Illich refers to them as being 'convivial' (Tools, 20). If, on the other hand, the designs and uses of artifacts foster individual depen- dence on external sources of knowledge, he refers to them as being 'manipulatory' and/or 'indus-kial': Tools are inlrinsic to social relationships. An individual relates himself to action to his society thmugh the use of tools that he actively masters, or by which he is passively acted upon. To the degree that he masters his tools, he can invest the world with his meaning; to the degree that he is mastered by his tools, the shape of the tool deter- mines his own self-image. Convivial tools are those which give each person who uses them the greatest opportunity to enrich the environment with the fruits of his or her vision. Industrial tools deny this possibility to those who use them and they allow their designers to determine the meaning and expec- tations of others (Tools, 21). Because mass production of goods and services in industrial nations goes hand-in-hand with a separation between the producers and consumers of knowledge, Illich maintains that most modern technologies are manipula- tory. Where manipulatory tools and social arrangements prevail, at the expense of convivial ones, technology ceases to liberate people. It becomes, instead, a new form of enslavement. People lose rewards that can be gained only when they master their own environment. Convivial tools, to the contrary, are naturally suited to the satisfaction of intrinsic needs and endow the user with competency that is similar to William Leiss' notion of 'craft skills': \"Craft skills require an intimate howledge of the materials which are used in the realization of an objective . \"15 Thus, manipulatory tools render people dependent on extermal sources of knowledge, while convivial technologies facilitate inbinsic authority and/or competence that serves as a check against manipulation. Despite the fact that Illich often refers to manipulatory tools as being more cmplex in design than convivial ones, he argues that technologies can be used toward different ends, regardless of their degree of sophistication: \"In principle the distinction between convivial and manipulatory tools is independent of the level of technology of the tool\" (Tools, 22). Like Innis, he believes that technology cannot be assessed on the basis of design alone, but rather, in relationship to psychological, social, economic, and political factors. In this sense, an inherently manipulatory tool can be used in a convivial fashion and vice versa. Evidence of this principle occurred in medicine when nineteenth century clinicians discovered ways to improve urban sewers, water supplies, and housing. Initially, these early applications of science to solving public health pmblans were convivial. For example, community members were responsible for knowing how to identify contaminated water, as well as maintaining neighbowhood wells. However, later in the same century, this knowledge was monopolized by the profession of medicine, thus converting convivial technologies into manipulatory ones (Tools, 1). Apart from rendering people dependent on external sources of expertise, professional monopolies are counterproductive. Beyond a certain pint, manipulatory tools and arrangements undermine the pur- poses for which they are designed (Tools, l). In medicine, for example: ... one out of every five patients admitted to a typical research hospital acquires an iatrogenic disease, sometimes trivial, usually requiring special treatment, and in one case in thirty leading to death. Half of these episodes result from complications of drug therapy; amazingly, one in ten comes from diagnostic procedures (Limits, 41). Thus manipulatory tools and uses have escalated to the pint where institutional medicine has becane health-denying. Illich applies this line of reasoning to all professional monopolies. Professional domination and the escalation of counterproductivity is tolerated in industrial societies because science and the myth of technological progress ovemules, in Illich's mrds, lllegal, cultural, and political precedents as fomd guidelines to present behaviour\" (Tools, xxiii). In manipulatory societies, mst citizens cannot evaluate the limitations of professional management, because they do not possess specialized knowledge. Fully manipulated individuals do not and cannot resist dcanination because of a belief that the good life is synonymous - with consuming commercial products and services. From Illich's point of view, govermnt policy, industrial expansion, and professional domination, go hand in hand. For example, when governments establish health care insurance schemes in the name of 'public interest', it is ultimately the interests of industry and professions that are served: Our market-intensive societies measure material progress by the increase in the volume and variety of comdities produced. And taking our cue frm this sector, we measure sccial progress by the distribution of access to these camrrrodities. Ecommics has been developed as propaganda for the takeover by large-scale comrmdity producers. Socialism has been debased to a struggle against handicapped distribution, and welfare ecommics has identified the public good with opuleme -- the hmiliating opulence of the poor in United States hospitals, jails, or asylums (Needs, 7). Increased access to indus~ial goods and services improves the quality of life to a pint, but beyond this, access serves to accelerate disabling intervention and fuel the myth of progress. In summary, Illich believes that industrial societies are manipu- latary ; important needs are defined and satisfied, primarily through institutional mechanisms; exchange-values replace use-values in mst areas of social life . Professional mnoplies of knowledge represent a principle source of manipulation because they promote our dependency on external sources of authority, at the expense of defining and satisfying intrinsic needs in an autommus fashion. For Illich, an ideal social organization of knawledge results when there is balance between what people \"need to do by themselves and what they need to obtain ready-made'' (Tools, 51). Balance of this sort facilitates autonomous control and mutual caring among people who, at the same time, benefit frm extrinsic sources of howledge. This ideal, or convivial society, is difficult to construct, in contemporary Western cultures, because knowledge is entrenched in elite groups that determine our needs and how they are to be satisfied. Medicine, one of the most powerful of these groups, has acquired the authority to determine how health and illness are thought about and dealt with. There is virtually no segment of problematic social behaviour over which doctors do not have cmplete or partial authority. Their permission is required to obtain drugs -- both prescription and 'over- the-counter' varieties. They are often called upon to determine if an individual is 'fit to stand trial' and/or if the convicted person was 1 sane' or 'insane' at the scene of the crime. They can decide who should or should not conceive a child and when a wman should abort her fetus or carry it to full term. The list of physical, moral, legal, and social judgements that medical experts make on our behalf is so extensive, that Illich has devoted an entire book to the subject of medical domination (~imits). The problem with rnodern professions, such as medicine, stems from the nature of their authority. Professional status is based on a membemhip of individuals who have demons-trated mastery of specialized scientific knowledge. Science, to a large extent, determines the of professional conduct. However, when scientific doctors define satisfy medical needs, their actions can result in health-denying counterproductive outcmes. People experience further impairment rules and and/or or death as a result of professional intervention. The capacity of citizens to effectively challenge professional authority, in such cases, is enfeebled because sciene has acquired a dual function in industrial societies: It is used to generate as well as to legitinate professioml knowledge and power. This predicament is reinforced by manipulatory arrangements, whereby government, industry, and professional groups hold mutual interests. The overall result is that the public is de-politicized and, therefore, unable to resist further manipulation. 38 FOOTNOTES TO CHAPTER TWO 'The topic of Illich's philosophy thesis was \"bstoevski and Vladmb Soloviev as precursors of existentialism', particularly in their concepts of intuitive knowledge.

They argue that when cultural arrangements endow individuals with authority, force and/or manipulation from external sources of power can be resisted. For Innis, individuals and institutions are in optimum relationship to one another when the biases of communication are balanced; when problem-solving is based on a concern for time, as well as space. Illich, on the other hand, believes that people are best able to define and satisfy important needs when exchange and use-values are balanced; when tools are used in a convivial fashion. While Innis and Illich are not technological determinists, they argue that technologies are inherently predisposed toward particular effects. For example, Innis concentmtes on communications techmlogy and argues that durable media, such as clay, stone, and parchment, tend to bias communication and culbres in favour of -tradition, ritual and/or time. Media that are less durable, such as papyrus and paper, lend them- selves to intellectual and geographical expansion, mvelty, and/or space. Illich contends that complex technology often enhances institutional or large-scale problem-solving while simpler designs facilitate convivial or small-scale enterprise. Both writers distinguish technology according to tendencies that are endemic to design but they believe that the relationship of techno- logy to howledge and powr is best understood when examined within a larger cultural context. For Innis, this involves tracing the source F of knowledge to groups who monopolize cmunication. Historically, religious groups have been favoured by durable media. Their monopo- lization of the dominant system of writing served to organize knowledge and power in a way that extended their con-trol into virtually every seg-nent of cultural activity. Conversely, secular groups have risen to power through their control over writing systems based on transient media. In same cultur~s, notably classical Greece, a sbmng oral tradition provided an effective check against the mnoplization of knowledge. While Innis points to the source of professional monopolies in the modern West, Illich starts with the premise that monopolies exist, and .- proceeds to show hm professions mintain and extend their authority. He concludes that organizational and ideological links between science, government, industry, ad professional groups result in mipulatory societies. In a manipulatory society, focal activities, such as learning and healing, are standardized into needs that require institutional commodities to be satisfied. This kind of standardization leads people to neglect intrinsic activity and regard extrinsic needs and sources of satisfaction as being the best or most progressive way to live. Illichts description of industrial or manipulatory societies is similar to Innist notion of mdern Western civilization as an empire that is entrenched in a spatial bias of cmunication. Spatially biased systems of per foster a preoccupation with science, econgnic and military expansion, and a belief in progress, to the detriment of howledge that serves the need for strong common ties between people. In both manipulatory and spatially biased cultures, irdividuals are rendered dependent upon external sources of knowledge. The means and ways of lolowing about the world are institutionalized and rigidly controlled by elite groups. Modern medicine represents but one of many such pups that serve to maintain dominant systems of power in modern Western nations. TRADITIONAL SYSTEMS OF AUTHORITY IN WESTERN MEDICINE PART TWO: INTRODUCI'ION Sociologists selected for this thesis regard professionalization as a phenomenon that is unique to industrialized societies. In so doing,' they focus on nineteenth century events that led to the crystallization of the medical profession as we know it today. Thus, they tend to treat ancient and medieval medical history lightly as opposed to using it to assess the nature of authority in mdern practice. While I accept the premise that mdern medicine is embedded in a unique system of power within indus-h.ial nations, I also believe that traditional medical systems were unique and should be examined in their own right. I derive this assumption from the writings of Harold Innis who, as discussed in Chapter One, organizes history according to unique empires or systems of power that have come and gone in relation to developments in communication. Therefore, in keeping with Innis' historical perspective, I have chosen to examine the nature of medical knowledge and corresponding systems of au-thority within particular epochs of Western civilization. Broadly speaking, the term 'traditional healing programs' refers to medical thought and practice in various . empires throughout the 'writing phase' of civilization.:'; Specifically, the nature of traditional healers' authority is discussed with respect to medical howledge that evolved from oral communication and writing systems that were based on clay, stone, papyrus and parchment. + The 'writing phase' refers to significant developments in written cammunication prior to the introduction of printing in the fifteenth century. i i In the conclusion to this part, I endeavour to point out that written forms of ccmmunication have been crucial variables in the formtion of knowledge monopolies in medicine prior to mdern times. The degree and nature of traditional healers' authority is examined in relation to the biases of early communication systems. It is antici- pated that this overview of traditional healing programs will enable the reader to appreciate, mre fully, the importance of the printing press to the growth of mdern mdicim. THE HEALJNG ARTS: A SURVEY OF WESTERN MEDICINE FRW ANTIQUITY TO THE FIm CENTURY Throughout histmy, to a marked degree, health semices have reflected in miniature the achieve- ments and failures of the societies in which they have existed. Elliott A. Krause This chapter is interded as a from ancient times to the close of survey of traditional healing programs the Middle Ages. No pretense is made to represent medical history in the following pages. Rather, the focus is on Western systems of health care in relationship to the biases of early instruments of comunication. Using the mnopoly concept as a guide, traditional medicine is broken into particular systems or insti- tutions of health care in various cultures. Each system is examined with respect to the nature of official medical authority and sources of conflict and competition in respective health care markets. This survey of -traditional healing programs begins with a brief look at pre-literat; medicine. It is intended merely as a way of stressing the hportance of early notation systems on medical knmledge throughout recorded history. %o healing programs in Babylonia are discussed. They are shown to be related to the growth of empires based on the use of clay, and then, stone tablets, as the dominant comnunications media. This is followd by a section on Egyptian medicine after the introduction of papyrus. Then, healing in classical Q?eece is examined in terms of that culture's strong oral -tradition and alphabet. The next section highlights Roman influence over Greek medicine in conjunction with the introduction of parchment in Western civilization. The final section is an examination of medicine during the Middle Ages when kmledge was written in manuscript form. This section also includes reference to the inbmduction of paper but stops short of the invention of the printing press. PFE-LITERATE HENDJG bst conjecture about prehistoric medicine is based on anthropolo- gical studies of contemporary primitive societies. Apart from some archaeological evidence such as cave paintings and surgical instruments fashioned from stone and shell, historians know very little about medical thought and practice in prehistoric societies.' Despite this dearth of information, however, most historians agree that medicine began with the shaman who was a central figure in tribal life. Socio- logist, Vern Bullough, describes the pre-literate healer's role as such: Tne shamm in ancient and primitive society was and is much more than a physician. He was piest, sorcerer, physician, chief of the tribe and the king who ruled over the people. Quite frequently he was the poet of the group, the mn who knew the stories and songs and could tell of the origins of the world and of the deeds of the tribe and its heroes in a far rernote age. (2) In short, a shaman was the authoritative source of the society's accumulated wisdom. The shaman's importance to the present study stems from the nature of his authority which was, according to Bullough, \"based upon magical comunication with the gods.\"3 Legimitation for this power could come from his ances*al inheritance, dreams, or visions; through skill or luck that enabled him to survive an extraordinary event; or any number of symbolic actions that authenticated his gift for healing according to the rules of the society. 4 f& far as historians can determine, shamen used rational5\" me-thods such as drug -therapies, surgery, innoculations, and massage, to arrive at effective ixa-bnent~.~ The intention he is not to elaborate on the details of treatment protocol, but merely to stress the point that effective treatxent was not consciously linked to rational techniques. Rathw, physical interventions were ways in which the shaman released dmns from the afflicted part of the patient's body. In all probability, the shaman maintained an elevated position in tribal life because of rational techniques but, in pre-literate consciousness, physical inter- vention was rnthing other than the healer's way of negotiating the best terms from the Magical power was tbught to be the reason for successful treatment outcomes. By virtue of advanced standing in age and instmctions from other wisenen, the shaman had access to information that was outside the range of other tribal membersf experience. But, because this knowledge was corranunicated through oral pathways, it was intimately connected to the symbolic universe and everyday experience of the society. For this reason, the shaman's 'store' of information did not constitute the ultimate legitimation for his authority within the Rather, he was ackmwledged as a leader and healer because of what he did with his knowledge; because his actions proved that he was capable of defending * The term naZL0rf.u.l is used here and thmughout this thesis to refer to rredical knowledge that is based on the physical dimension of reality. Specifically, 'rational' healers are cognizant of cause and effect relations between physical intervention and symptom reduction. 'Irrationalf healers, on the other hard, may employ ratioml methods but they at-tribute effective outcomes to magic or religion. individuals against evil forces. In short, the shaman's knowledge and its corresponding pawe.?? was pragmtic. The pragmtic dimension of authority in pre-literate societies is illustrated by Paul Radin in his book ?he World of Primitive Man in which he quotes a Fiji Islander who said : \"A thing has mana when it works ; it has mt mana when it doesn't work.\"* In terms of the shaman's authority, his mana or magical power was based on his ability to heal. When his treatrents worked, he was powerful, and when his actions failed, he did not have the power to exact the best terms from the spirits. This pragmatic approach to healing,'in Illich's terms, ensured that knowledge was used in a convivial fashion. Thus, the aspect of healing that registered in pre-literate consciousness .was spiritual, while cause and effect relations between physical intervention and treatment outcomes were not acknowledged on a conscious level. There were no lines to distinguish spiritual and physical phemmm. Healing was not a specialized activity; it was coherent and assimilated with everyday life where participants shared a common frame of reference. Because knowledge was communicated orally, the shaman's store of medical information could not be mmpolized. It was generated through the form of communication that was employed to negotiate reality in every facet of social life. Therefore, the shaman's authority was intimately bound to camon knowledge or daily experience. Tkis relationship between knmledge and per underwent significant transformations as soon as information was comnunicated through writing. HEALING IN BABYLONIA Tablets dating fm approximately 2300 to 600 B.C. indicate that healers from ancient civilizations along the Tigris-Euplrcates Valley were cognizant of differences between the magical and rational dimensions of their craft. This finding is particularly applicable to records that reflect healing programs in Babylonia. Wrllough reasons that differences between spiritual and physical phenomna registwed in consciousness as smn as hwledge was written because, in his words, \"it led to a division in medicine between the literate practitioners and the mre empirical illiterate ones.\"' This, in turn, led to the emergence of a specialized healing role in society as well as distinct functions within that role. As in primitive society, illness was regarded as a spiritual matter, resulting from an immoral act that displeased the gods or fm a spell cast by a sorcerer or witch. But, as Babylonian priests began to monopolize cuneiform writing on clay tablets, the shaman's unspecialized role was taken out of antexts of everyday life and segnented into three parts. First, the diviner or bad-priest was responsible for determining the mtm of sin that had caused the illness. Secondly, when the source of evil was revealed, the &hipu-priest exorcised the spell or appeased the dmns through various rites and ircantations. ?he third type of healer was called \"one who howls water\". lo ?he dsu subscribed to the concept of illness as a spiritual problem but also recognized that natural factors, su& as food, water, climate, and personal hygiene had some bearing on the patient's condition. Because asu healers were often illiterate, their knowledge was derived from trial and em treatment which consisted primarily of surgery and herbal therapy. Babylonian priests, like shamen, acted as the carriers of accumu- lated wisdom. But, unlike pre-literate wisemen, bad-priests recorded and stored krowledge on clay tablets. When collective memory was strengthened by early rotation systems, the spiritual concept of disease acquired some new definitions whi& altered the processes of diagnosis and prescription. Just as writing had proven to be useful for keeping administrative tallies (wire, 26) it also facilitated the making of lists pertaining to specific diseases. Hence 'illness', as a unified or general concept, was broken into specific 'illnesses' which were identified and grouped according to the location of symptoms or places where evil spirits had lodged themselves in the body. 1n this manner, disease came to be represented as a series of distinct phemmna and diagnosed accordingly. Given that the causes of disease entities were thought to be spiritual problems, the cure was logically tied to moral law. One of the best known and far-reaching of Babylonian mral prescriptions was the isolation of diseased individuals. Quarantine was rationalized on the basis of protecting others from contact with the offending demons. 12 The Hebrew culture was the first to adopt this measure and embellish it into an elaborate code for public hygiene. Eventually, knowledge of this practice spread to other cultures and variations upon the th- have appeared in every country and epoch of Western history. Prior to 1800 B.C., when religion dominated Babylonia's written badition, the thrust of medical prescriptions was, essentially, philosophical counsel or guidelines for 'correct' living. Because the &us' social position was a lowly one, as evidenced by the absence of a divine patron for their empirical craft,13 codes for medical conduct did not include references to surgery and the administration of herbal remedies. In fact, the &us1 status as legitimate practitioners was tenuous, at best. They were virtually indistinguishable from barbers who practiced surgery and were ~spnsible for branding slaves. 14 Hence, rational information rarely achieved entry status into written medical laowledge. Psound 1800 B.C., Babylonian medical knowledge took on a new character. Records idicate a shift away from religiously inspired codes tward a preoccupation with rational healing methods. This shift in emphasis coincides with the rise of centralized secular rule under Hammurabi. It is also consistent with Innis' idea that the priesthood's monopoly over a complex system of writing, based on clay and the stylus, invited competition from a medium of communication that could be trans- ported more efficiently. Sto~ tablets proved to be a medium that lent itself to large-scale administrative tasks. They were, thus, partly responsible for a shift in the bias of communication -- away from religious values and toward a monarchy arid secular concerns (Enpire, 54). Innis mtes that as Babylonia moved tward a unified nation, rural law was reworked into civil law: \"The rights and prerogatives established by priests in earlier codes of law were arranged in patrician order\" (Empire, 32). The following excerpt from The Code of Hammurabi illus- trates the implications that these developments had for healing: If a doctor has treated a freeman with a metal knife for a severe wound, and has cured the free- man, or has opened a freeman's tumor with a metal knife, and cured a freeman's eye, then he shall receive ten shekels of silver. If the son of a plebeian, he shall receive five shekels of silver. If a man's slave, the owner of the slave shall give two skkels of silver to the doctor. If a doctor has treated a man with a metal knife for a severe womd, and has caused the man to die, or has opened a man's tumor with a metal knife and destroyed the man's eye, his hands shall be cut off . If a doctor has treated the slave of a plebeian with a mtal knife for a severe wound and caused him to die, he shall render slave for slave. If he has opened his tumr with a metal knife and destroyed his eye, he shall pay half his price in silver. If a doctor has healed a freemn's broken bone or has restored diseased flesh , the patient shall give the doctor five shekels of silver. If he be the son of a plebeian, he shall give three shekels of silver. If a man's slave, the owner of the slave shall give two shekels of silver to the doctor. If a doctor of oxen or asses has treated either ox or ass for a severe wound, and cured it, the owner of the ox or ass shall give to the doctor one sixth of a shekel of silver as his fee. (15) While there is no evidence to prove that these laws were strictly enforced, their very nature suggests that early literate civilization had made some radical departures from pre-literate structures of consciousness. ?he first departure is indicated by the code's reference to cause and effect relations between physical intervention ard treatment outcomes. For example, \"If a doctor has treated a freeman with a metal knife for a severe wound, and has cured the freeman...\" is a phrase that represents a radical change from the pre-literate belief that a cure was a result of the shaman's power to exact the best terms from the spirits. By the same token, references to surgery and bonesetting, at the expense of moral codes pertaining to lifestyle, indicates that priestly counsel could not conform and/or did not figure into the technical demands of a spatial bias of communication. Secondly, the code assigns gradational values to activities associa- ted with healing. The irqlication is that the value of various treatments and corresponding outcomes was dependent upon the nature of the inter- vention and the social ranking of the patient. Distinctions between eye surgery and bonesetting, for example, as well as freemen, plebeians, and slaves, is clearly an indication that the pragmatic value system of pre-literate people was aupnted and/or supplanted by technical systems of measurement. Value codes based on Babylonian civil law were a far cry from the pe-literate equation: 'If the shaman's treatment worked, it had mana or value and, if it failed to achieve the desired result, it was not valuable. 'I The third and final departure suggested by the code is that healing had become institutionalized into a secular system of power. This is illus-trated by the temn that was used to designate 'healer' which translates into the rodern word 'doctor'. It was used to preface the ten provisions in The Code of Hammurabi that are devoted to medical law. 16 This is more meaningful when one considers that the code included two hundred seventy-two other provisions that were divided according to the function of distinct occupational groups such as lawyers ard archi- tects .17 Clearly, healing had become one of many specialized and secularized functions in the Babylonian nation. By the sixth century B.C., the production of tablets was monopolized by a few families which served, in Bulloughls opinion, to stagnate medi- cal thought : The canplicated form of written language devised in the area made it impossible for any but the select few to read. Originally potential scribes had undergone lengthy training in a 'tablet1 house but educational functions had soon fallen to individual family schools. The same families dhnated all aspects of literate Life including the maAU nmka tradition. Their practice and thought came to be traditionalized so that medi- cine became static. (18) When knowledge was momplized by individual families, medicine, as a special occupation, virtually disappeared by the fifth century B.C. It was during this time that Herodotus was credited with saying that Babylonian medicine was nothing moE than an informal process of public consultat ion : They have m physicians, but when a man is ill they lay him in the public square, and the passers- by come up to him, and if they have ever had his disease themselves or have known anyone who has suffered from it, they give him advice, recmen- ding him to do whatever they found good in their own case, or in the case known to them. And no one is allowed to pass the sick man in silence without asking him what his ailment is. (19) Thus, Babylonian medicine was molded, first, by the hands of priests; secondly, by bureaucrats and rational healers ; and, thirdly, by literate families who removed it from the fabric of everyday life. EGYPTIAN MEDICINE When contrasted with Babylonia, Egy-pt's system of medicine was more complex and flexible in terms of blending spiritual/written and rational/ oral dimensions of healing. Medical historians such as S. and V. Leff, attribute this to the use of papyrus, which enabled Egyptian priests to import and incorpo~te ideas from Chim, India, Crete, Babylonia, and Assyria. 20 Bullough, on the other hand, correlates Egypt's enlightened healing program to its central place in an elaborate religious system: 'With a physician in the actual pantheon of the gods, and with all the gods showing concern for health, the Egyptian physician was allowed considerable freedom to develop empirical cures. \"*' The physician to wham Bullough refers is Imhotep, an immortalized figure frm the third dynasty who achieved fame as a healer, prime minister, chief architect, astrologer, and mathematician. 2 2 The Edwin Smith Papyrus, which dates back to 1600 B.C., represents the most extensive record that modern historians use to speculate about Egyptian medical practice. The most interesting aspect about this document is that, considering it was written under religious jurisdiction, it is remarkably rational in emphasis. kff surmises that the pre- occupation with physical dimensions of healing was a result of the importance of armies ad, hence, army physicians in Egyptian culture. He reasons that army physicians abandoned the ancient practice of lengthy incantations to the gods in favour of more expedient ways of returning munded soldiers to the battlefield. 23 The papyrus is composed of numerous case studies that are system- matized according to wounds of the head, neck, thorax, spine and limbs. In most cases, the injury was diagnosed and treated surgically with an army of tools fashioned fm bronze: It is clear that the surgeon first studied the injury carefully and decided on the mst app- priate treatment before he started to operate. The qualities that made bronze suitable for tools and weapons also made it useful for medical instruments, and the surgeon had at his disposal a wide selection of knives, pmbes, forceps and surgical saws: better equipped than his prede- cessors, he was encouraged to make great advarces in his practice. (24) Not only was the diagnosis and treatment related primarily to physical realities such as visible wounds and tools, but, according to Leffls synopsis, prognosis was also tied to the strengths and/or limitations of the attending physician's skill and instruments: In most cases the favourable prognosis was expressed in the words: \"I will cure the disease.\" If the prognosis was doubtful, the formula was \"Nothing can be done in this caset1, and if unfavour- able, \"The patient will die.\" (25) Ekvxn this assessment, it appears that Egyptian healws demonstrated an approach to disease that is referred to as rational as opposed to magical and/or spiritual. This is not to suggest, however, that healing was entirely rational in nature. Extant papri that include Egyptian medical lore up to 600 B.C. indicate that healing was, in fact, a conscious canbination of rationally and religiously inspired action. Treatment of a cataract, for example, involved an application of ointment with the accompanying incant at ion : Come, verdigris ointment ! Come, verdigris ointment ! Come, thou verdant one! Cane to him and take from him the water, the pus, the blood, the pain in the eye, the blindness, the flcw of matter which are mrked there by the god of inflammations. (26) The ointment was considered to be impotent without its companion verse. At first glance, this example suggests tbt ~~yptian medicine was similar to pre-literate magical healing seategies. But, if one considers that Egyptian healers were cognizant of differences between spiritual and physical dimensions of illness and that the attending ~hysician(s 1 was diagnosing and treating on the basis of textbook instructions, the nature of healing takes on a different complexion. For, accurding to a Greek historian writing in the first century B. C. , Egyptian physicians followed their texts to the letter: ...ph ysicians receive support fm the cmunity, and they provide their services according to a written law canpiled by many farmus physicians of ancient times. And if after following the laws read from the sawed books they camt save the patient, they are let go free fran all complaint, but if they act contrary to what was written they await condemnation to death, since the lawmaker thinks that few men would have knowledge better than the method of treatment observed for a long time and prescribed by the best specialists. (27) For these reasons, achievement in Egyptian medicine began to decline and knowledge was closed in a corpus that reflected a teqoral bias of comnicat ion. Before this closure, however, Egyptian medicine enjoyed a period of innovation. As was mentioned earlier, healing was an essential component of an elaborate religious system that was, after the intro- duction of papyrus, 'fused' with the mnarchy (Finpire, 25). Medical records were controlled by the priesthood but practice was regulated by 2 8 the king. The hierarchical structure began with superintendents, follomd by inspectors, chiefs, and a host of specialists such as the 'physician of the belly', 'guardian of the colon', and 'treater of the teeth'. 29 So emred were the Egyptians with specialized healers, that one king is reported to have had two 'physicians of the eyes' -- one doctor for each eye. 30 Bullough contends that me canbination of religious and secular control enabled healers to experiment with rational medicine while still retaining their priestly titles an3. status. 31 This flexible structure existed long enough for physicians to establish an extensive set of standards far practice -- all of which can be broken into several units. First, rational observation was advised. Physicians were instructed to note changes in skin colour, pulse rate, temperature, muscle tone, and mvement, and to examine the patient's faeces, urine, and discharges. These impressions were more or less standardized by lengthy descriptions of specific cases. Secondly, diagmsis was made by referring to various recorded case histories that contained observations paralleling the ones made with respect to the current case. Written precedents contained descriptions of a particular patient's symptoms that were entered aftevl a standard lead-in of \"Thou shalt say concerning it.. .\" and the prescription followed a phrase \"Thou shalt do against it. . . . lf3 Treatment, being the third and final component of text ins'trmctions, included recipes far various drugs and ointments as well as verses and directives as to how often or in what order to recite them. 533 * Interestingly, medical texts did not contain anatomical howledge that was part of Egyptian mcrrtuary pmctices. Had the Egyptian empire been able to sustain a flexible relationship between religious ad secular authority, healers may well have continued to extend the range of medical knowledge along the lines of rational observation that characterized the foregoing codes. But, when religion mnopolized hieroglyphic writing (Empire, 25) the rational howledge of Egyptian healers began to wane. And, as Bullough notes, rational medicine did not come to fruition in Egypt to the extent that it did in Weece . 3 4 THE HEALING ARTS IN GREECE ?he story of healing in Greece is an exceptional one in the history of Western medicine because Q?eek healers were exempt from many con- straints that inhibited rational thought in otheu, ancient cultures. To begin with, Greek medicine was founded on an oral tradition: There were virtually no medical texts written prior to the fifth century B.C. 3 5 Historians like Dolan and Sigerist point out that most of what was known about healing until that time was learned fm observations in the kitchen, battlefield, and sacrificial altar, and that this knowledge was transmitted via peripatetic healers, philosophers, and orators. 36 Yet, despite the absence of a formal written tradition, medicine was an important part of &eek culture. In Homer's epics, for example, healing was regarded as a 'noble art'. 3 7 In ancient Greece, all of the gods were thought to possess the powr to cause illness and. to heal. * By the ninth century B. C. , healing acquired a more formal structme that was adapted from the Egyptian deity, Motep. First, Paeon, then Pgollo, and, finally, Asclepius emerged in succession as distinct healing deities. F'rm the sixth century B.C. and onward, @eek healers were acknowledged to be sons of Psclepius . This latter cult spread throughout Q?eece, Asia Minor, and, later, Rome and its colonies .40 An important difference between &eek deities and the Egyptian &el was that Greek priests did not contml the production of knowledge. This was due to cultural regionalism whidh prevented the development of a strong priest bureaucracy in Greece. According to Bullough, these corditions provided fertile soil for the growth of rational or secular medicine : The identification with a deity gave the physi- cian the status both to treat and to innovate. Innovation proved easier than in Egypt because the Greeks lacked an overall cosmology, had various competing cults, and believed that the gods had not revealed everything to man lxlt rather had left men much to find out thmugh their own investigations. Even though the temples of Asclepius were run by priests, there was plenty of room in Greek medicine for the mre secular practitioner who could claim descent from the gods. (41) Hence, on the basis of a s-trong oral tradition and a flexible religion, Greek medicine evolved into what is generally regarded as the most enlightened system in the ancient world. In Greek city-states, knowledge about health and disease was an integral part of the culture at large and never the sole domain of physicians. It was, for example, often a subject for poetsQ2 and, in centres like Athens, medical information was part of highly esteemed general education and gymnastics programs. The importance of health to Greek citizens and the cmunication of idealized principles is described by historians, blan and Adams-Smith, in the following quote: Athenian education was aimed at developing the whole man, both physical and mental. This ideal had great hygienic value because general education and health education went hand in ha nd.... Health knowledge did not all flow from the physician. He also received help from the educators or philoso- phers and the trainers. The trainers were keen observers, knew quite a lot about surface anatmy, and were able to give advice on the correct diet (in the Q-eek sense), which would provide for the best physical and mental well-being. (43) This passage reinforces Innis' notion that Greek medicine flourished because it was a vital part of life outside of the \"sphere of moral law\" and that it was taught and practiced in contexts where first-hand experience was the \"basis of knowledge\" (Ehpire, 93). Owing to the physician's working conditions, curative medicine was also part of everyday experience. Except for wealthy pa-trons, medicine was practiced in public squares where the itinerant physician and his assistant set up temporary consulting bases. It was here that, according to Sigerist, the patient's family and: ... neighbours would stand around, giving advice and all talking at the same time. Dislocated joints were reduced, broken ex-tremities splinted, and other operations performed, more or less in public. (44) Even though the relationship between a physician and his assistant was bound by some rules of secrecy, the master of the craft instructed his apprentice orally during public consultations. Heme, much of the doctor's expertise was seen and heard by groups of bystanders throughout the course of his stay in a particular camunity . Apart fram midwives and rootcutters physicians tended to most health related needs that * Local people who knew where to obtain medicinal plants and how to prescribe than. could not be satisfied through general education or self ad mutual care. Medical education extended beyond the range of poetry, gymmstics and peripatetic masters ad their apprentices. Throughout Greece's history, there were schools where the craft of healing was taught. By the fifth century B.C., the most fmus cenees existed at Crotona in Sicily, Rhodes, Cyrene, Cnidus in Asia Minor, and the island of Cos. 45 Many historians believe that these schools originated as family guilds that accepted outsiders as students.46 Each one grew in numbers of students and in stature ad, as a result of relative autonomy, reputations were built on distinctive foundations. Masters of the craft at Crotona, for example, were influerced by Pythagoras who believed that disease was the result of disequilibrium of various forces. 47 Cnidian teachers, on the other hand, became famous for their howledge of diagnostic 48 techniques. Cos, the most notorious school, was respected for the Hippocratic inspired doc*ine on body humors as well expertise in prognosis. 49 Around the fowth century B.C., the healing arts came under attack. Healers were criticized for over-emphasizing craft skills at the expense of philosophy. Plato and Aristotle were two of many such detractors but, interestingly, their critique appears to stem fram a new literary consciousness as opposed to evidence that healing programs had failed in a pragmtic sense. The crux of their argument against oral-based healing is highlighted by Bullough in the following passage: Undoubtedly both Plato and Aristotle would admit that the ~hysician could impmve his abilities by practice, but the difficulty with &eek medicine as understood by Plato and Aristotle was quite simply that it was not beyond the understanding of the better educated laymen. There were un- doubtedly secret recipes which were transmitted by the various teachers, but the greater the emphasis on empiricdl training the less likely the physician was to be accepted into the edu- cated classes. (50) Bulloughts interpretation of Platots Aristotle's critique of medicine suggests that written educational credentials were becoming increasingly important for the legitimation of physicianst authority. Opinions such as those expressed by Plato and Mistotle were challenged by the en3 of the fourth century B.C. because of Alexander the Great's conquest of the Persian Bnpire. This resulted in a flood of ideas frwn Egypt, Persia, and Babylonia, as w11 as a permanent site for intellectual activity in Alexandria. Here, at the Temple of the Muses, Greeks, Egyptians, Jews, and learned men from other lands, met to exchange ideas; to record observations from its famus botanical gardens; and, for the first time, to observe and record dissections in a systm- matic fashion. 51 Alexandria is the place where Greek medicine was both defended against its detractors and defined as a branch of natural philosophy. 52 It became a centre for revitalized thought in medicine; the place to which anonyrmusly written documents were carried, discussed, and, eventually, rewritten and compiled into a collection of texts that is called The Hippocratic Corpus. These documents are composed of medical lore from divergent sources. They include case studies, discourses on dietetic therapy, pharmacology, surgery, anatany, and ethics. 53 The main thrust is toward rational observation with sane theorizing, as well as sections devoted to polemic against 'quackst. The latter were defined as healers who continued to subscribe to the notion that diseases ere caused by divine wrath to the exclusion of applying secular or rational howledge. 54 The theme that recurs throughout The Hippomatic Corpus is that illness originates in both spiritual and physical realities and that healing, if it is to be effective, must address both dimensions of the experience. Sigerist describes it this way: \"...prayers undoubtedly are a very good thing, but while praying to the gods one must help oneself.\" 55 The Hippocratic Corpus is a legacy that permeates the history of Western medicine, partially because it contains the mst extensive extant record of ancient medical wisdom but, ppimarily, because it represents a radical departure frm what is called 'archaic medicine'. This means that for the first time in histmy, healers could augment a trial and error approach to practice with theoretical constructs based on natural philosophy. This is in con-adiction to ecclesiastical theorizing and the case study method that characterized medical texts in Babylonia and Egypt. Sigerist describes these changes in the folloixing passage: In archaic medicine, theory and particularly ana- tomy come last. The starting point of all medical action is the sick man and his canplaints -- that is, the symptoms of disease. Hippocratic medicine is no longer ardhaic. Theories play a very impor- tant part in it, and when a physician prescribed a diet or drugs, he was not guided by experience alone but very often by theoretical considerations, endeavouring to evacuate a humor or to aid the organisim with its natural healing power. (56) Hence, abstract thought shifted from a spiritual base to one that inclu- ded theories about the physical properties of the universe. The synchro- nous implidon for healing, therefore, was that the Greek ideal of basing all knowledge upon experiential and/or orally cammunicated infor- mation was overturned in favour of a moR abswact and complex way of knclwing about health and disease. The shift away from oral comunication and a praptic base for medical authority suggests that medical kmwledge was about to become rigid and stagnate under the control of Alexardrian scribes. On the contrary, though, the corpus remained remarkably open-ended. This is noted by Sigerist when he writes that \"...unlike the Hermetic books of Egypt, the Corpus Hippomaticum was never f-y constituted, never divided into a set number of books, never rigidly fixed.\"57 In this sense, medical knowledge that was written during Greecet s greatest period of achievement reflected the kind of ideal that Innis found in Aristotle's writings: \"His sytem was provisional and open, and pointed to a striving toward totality of problems rather than finished kmwledge\" (mire, 93). In short, a balance between time and space provided conditions that were most favourable for rational thought in classical medicine. Several factors can account for a prolonged period of creativity after medical knowledge was formalized through writing. The first pertains to the fact that, even though supplies of papyrus were easily accessed during Macedonian rule (Fmpire, 931, writing never replaced Greece's oral tradition but merely supplemented it. Egyptian script was displaced by the alphabet which, according to Innis, had the effect of deswying the East's monopoly of cqlex systems of writing. The alphabet lent itself to spoken language and, hence, checked the tendency of written cammunication to enhance uniformity 84 and 911.. in knmledge ('Empire, These ideas are born out in terms of developments in medicine. Texts were characterized by debates between competing ideas in natural philosophy. For example, Hemphilust concept that the brain was the centre of the nervous system was included with passages by histotelians who argued that the heart was the organ responsible for intelligence. 5 8 And, because notetaking became an adjunct to oral ins-uction at the 5 9 schools, many practical observations frm the field found their way into the production of written knowledge. Hence, medical texts were characterized by a continuous series of competing ideas and empirical data as opposed to dogmatic tracts that were sealed against evicence that contradicted theoretical guidelines. Anofher explanation for why healing escaped rigid institutionali- zation is that the temples of Asclepius were located on the margins of civilization -- in colonies that were on the periphery of Greek 6 0 influence. Temples, therefore, served to connect medical education and practice to Greek thought and to legitimate the physiciansf exper- tise .61 But, the priesthood couid not exercise firm regulatory power, like that of Babylonia, because priests lacked an hermetic corpus fram which to exact laws. For example, The Hippcratic Oath, when compared to The Code of Hmurabi, is very loosely comeived and does not led itself to the formulation of strict legal codes: I will apply dietetic measures for the benefit of the sick according to my ability and judge- ment. I will keep them from harm and injustice. I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody if asked for it, nar will I make a suggestion to this effect. Similarly I will not give to a woman an abartive remedy. In purity and holiness I will guard my life an3 my art. (62) Given the flexible nature of religious organization and written know- ledge, Greek healers benefitted fram the temples in terms of increased status and continuity with Greek ideas while, at the same time, remining free to innovate with ideas fran neighbouring cultures and with evidence that arose in clinical settings. The foregoing suggests that rational nedicine, in Greece, achieved an ideal that corresponds to Innis' and Illich's concepts of culture. In Innis' terms, Greek healers maintained a balance between continuity and permanence in knowledge as well as ekhibiting an openness to imva- tion: they had the means of solving problems in tesms of time and space. Or, fm Illich's frame of reference, classical medicine of the West was convivial because healing hinged on a balance between autonmus and interdependent activity. Illustrations to this effect can be found throughout the Hippocratic documents. For example, preventative measures such as diet, exercise, and harmony in one's life were emphasized. 6 3 Similarly, curative ~dicine was aimed at restoring the body to its natural state through the use of convivial tzxaments consisting primarily of dietetic therapy, philosophical counsel, and common or local herbs. Extraordinary interventions such as blood-letting, the prescription of uncomn drugs, and radical forms of surgery, were not condoned in the Hippocratic Oath. 64 Hence, the rational dimension of medicine was compatible with spiritual values because the healing role had not been segmented into literate priests/philosophers and illiterate craftsmen as it had been in Babylonia. The period of greatest achievement in Greek medicine began in the sixth century B.C. and lasted into the third century, at which point healing began to decline in the face of specialization. Open-ended debates in written cmunication were transfomd into rigid doctrines, the first of which was Rnpiricism. It emerged as a critique of the theoretical and, what many regarded as overly speculative thrust of Wek medicine. Empiricism was challenged around 140 B.C. by the Methodists who rejected the Hippomatic hurrroral theory and took the position that disease was the result of particular body mtions. Conflict continued to arise in connection with theoretical doctrines that were associated with the Cynics, Epicureans, ad other distinct schools of thought. 6 6 The implicaticm for medical knowledge was that it took on rigid divi- sions; became dogmatic; and, eventually, links between thought and prac- tice were weakened. In this sense, healing reflected the generd patterns of erosion that Innis found in the culture at that time (Eirrpire, 95-96). For a while, the flexibility of Greece's system of comunication created conditions that facilitated unprecedented developments in rational thought but, in so doing, it \"enhanced the problems of govern- ment with fatal results to large-scale political organization\" (Einpire , 84). The results to which Innis refers came by way of Raman invasions and the decline of rationalism in the West. GREEK MEDICINE UNDER THE ROMAN INFLUENCE Achievemnts in rational medicine are said to have culminated with tk mrk of Galen of Paragamm, A.D. 130-201. He is credited with systemmatizing the functions of body organs and was known to be a great physiotherapist and surgeon. 6 7 But, as originality of rational thought had all early as A.D. 30, the scope and but disappeared. Historians, like Bullough, attribute this to Roman empire building: \"Roman domina- tion of the Mediterranean led to a wider dissemination of @eek medical ideas and concepts, but it also led to a loss in status for the Greek physician. \"68 Pliny' s statement that a Greek physician was the \"only person who could kill another with sovereign impunity\" typifies the attitude that hmns held toward medicine.6g It was regarded as a plebeian craft; suitable for slaves and foreigners but rot for freemen 7 0 of the educated classes. Roman neglect of medicine had created healers, especially in Rome, where medical tion density. During the reign there was a resurgence of magic Prompted by a desire to enforce extent, satisfy pressing health conspicuous shortages of needs increased with popula- of Caesar Augustus, 27 B.C. to A.D. 14, being used for curative purposes. 71 laws against magic and, to a certain care needs that mse during famines, Augustus began to encourage f areign physicians to come to Ram . He devised sickness insurance schnes, hired public physicians, and granted the latter immunity fmn taxes. 72 Hence, for a brief period, it seemed as though the ideals of rational healing would take root in Rme. But, rather than elevating the status of secular physicians, Caesar's legislationmerely precipitated a wave of mss education. Many self-proclaimed physicians were anxious to capitalize on the new incentives and established six-mnth training programs that eventually became the norm for educating public physicians. 73 As a result, graduates lacked theoretical backgrounds as well as experience with diapstic, surgical, dietetic, and prognostic techniques. They tended to rely on anatomy manuals -- forms of comunication that had hitherto been unlcnclwn in medicine. 74 The predictable outcome of these events was that the quality of healing and the status of rational medicine declined even further. kkerknecht contends that during Augustus' tk, links between thecry ard practice were weakened. 75 His research concurs with Innis ' supposition that Augustus attempted \"to build up the prestige of Rome to offset that of Alexandria by establishing libraries\" ('Empire, 105). Eventually, native languages in southwestern lands were displaced by Latin and book-mkhg overtook my forms of oral comunication (bpire, 106). In terms of medicine, kkerknecht notes that when Roman scribes, sudh as Celsus and Pliny, began to compile texts, they were concerned with copying and translating as opposed incorporating informat ion 7 6 that originated thmugh practical experience. As a result, surgery was written out of sections pertaining to internal medicine. 77 In a broader sense, the result was the beginning of the end for the classical badition of fusing theory with first hand observation. Implications for practice were quickly realized as the few remaining physicians of prominence, such as Galen, terminated the custom of per- forming surgery. Rather, they began to read frm texts while super- vising operations that were perfomd by apprentices. 78 ?he texts that physicians followed acquired a new character, especially after Celsusr encyclopedia conventionalized and a.1-.tificially segmented Dogratism, Empiricism, Methodism, and ~neumaticism.~~ While these divisions existed during the classical period in Greece, strict parameters had never been desigmted until Roman scribes dominated intellectual activity in -the West. Thus, a wedge had been driven between the theoretical/written and the ratio&/ oral dimensions of healing and knowledge rigidified. Deterioration in rational medicine was more or less consolidated by Germanic invasions during the fifth century. According to Bullough, German control hastened the pace of ruralization and illiteracy, both of which were already underway in the Ronan These develop- ments tended to destroy a mdicum of support for secular healers and to i~rease the power of the church over medical issues : The decline of ~e city led to a decrease in the nmber and types of specialists .... Coinciding with these developments was a basic change in educational concepts and institutions as they were brought under the influence and then domina- tion of the Christian Church. The result was to give the Christian priest mst of the functions previously reserved to particular specialists. In a society in which literacy was on the decline, the priest had the advantage of being literate. This combined with his position in the cmunity as a symbol of God's church, served to give him many of the pers of the ancient shaman. (81) Thus, as rural communities grew around cathedrals, priests assumed the healing role within parishes and Western civilization moved into the Middle Ages when rnedicine was domi~ted by religion. HEALING DURING THE MIDDLE AGES Parchment was the medium of communication that facilitated the growth of a powerful religious hierarchy in the West. After Augustus, when redemptive religions were encouraged in response to a resurgence of magic, or what Innis calls \"widespread demand for individual salvation\" (mire, 1081, parchment proved to be a competitive medium that gave Christians an advantage over Eastern religions that were founded on papyrus : \"Used on both sides parchent was economical, durable, convaient, easy to transport, to write on, to read, and to consult\" (Dripire, 109). These features of parchment made it possible for Christians to record and preserve religious developents in Jerusalem and Antioch and to compile sacred books for transport to Rome which became the mst important Christian centre (Enpire, 110). Apart from a few monks such as St. Jerome, St. Benedict, and Cassiodorus ,82 the church had little appreciation for medicine. To this effect, Ackerknecht writes: This is evidenced as late as the sixth century in the writings of Pope Gregory and St. Gregory of Tours. They emphasized interest in the soul as opposed to concern for bodily ills. Christianity originally held its own theory of disease; disease was either punishnt for sins, possession by the devil, or the result of witchcraft. It also had its own therapeutic mthods -- namely, prayer, penitence, and the assistance of saints. Every cure , under these circumstances, was basically regarded as a miracle. ( 8 3 1 Monastic concepts of disease were reflected in medieval parishes where people relied on the use of Cf-iristian amulets to solve health related problems. Priests instructed their parishioners to pray in the name of Abraham, Isaac, and St. Blase instead of entreating pagan dieties for cures. 84 By the dawn of the Middle Ages, mnks had reworked medical informa- tion into a form that served the Chmh. Bullough found that popular medieval medical texts contained very few references that matched classi- cal documents with accuracy. For example, the text entitled Herbarium included inherited information abmt plants but excluded classical 8 5 treatises on animal and mineral drugs. Similarly, in the Dynamidia Hippocratis, Greek inspired dietetic therapy was well represented but mst other areas of the original Hippomatic Corpus were excluded. 86 The writings of Cassiodorms included sections of the original Hippratic Corpus but they were, as were mst medieval documents, dominated by Galents work in anatomy and his principle of reasoning by inductive analogy.87 FUrthennore, monks replaced the case study method of recording observations with short \"epistles\", \"dialogues\", \"catechisms\" 8 8 and \"didactic treatises\". The preservation of rational knowledge was further impaired in the seventh century when medicine was dropped from the liberal arts curriculum in momstic schools. It was reasoned that because \"celestial beings did not suffer from illness\", the healing arts should be excluded fm the consecrated arts such as theology, law, and asmlogy. These findings led Bullough to conclude that rational medicine barely survived the church's moropoly of knowledge during the seventh and eighth centuries. Early iii the ninth century, medical educatTon was restructured when Charlemagne ordered all monasteries and cathedrals to establish medical schmls . Alcuin, Charlemagne ' s educational advisor, classified medi- cine as one of seven branches of physica which also included arithmetic, astmnomy , geometry, music, mechanics, and astrology. While elevating the status of the healing arts, this decree did little to actually increase medical knowledge. In the first place, texts were housed by a few mnasteries and were, therefore, inaccessible to most schools. 9 2 Secondly, medicine was still considered to be a sideli~ for monks whose primary obligation was dinate relationship of century lib- of St. represented the extent to copy theological manuscripts. 93 medicine to theology is illustrated The subor- by the ninth Gall's cloister in Switzerland. Six texts of medical information while one thousand theology books were housed in the same mmstery . 94 Ebentually , medi- cine was deemed to be a disruptive element in cloistered Life so that, in 1130, the Council of Clemnd forbade monks to practice the healing arts. 95 Despite these setbacks, Bullough maintains that Charlemagne ' s support for medical education laid the groundwork for its incorporation into medieval universities which was, ultimately, the first step toward revitalization. 9 6 Late in the nineteenth century, innovations in medical thought coincided with the introduction of paper in Europe and the growth of commerce, cities, and universities. The church's mnopoly of knowledge, based on parchnt, began to wane as paper carried Psabic information to cmercial cen'bxs in the south (Rnpire, 128-1391. In the following pssage, Bullough traces the routes whereby medical knowledge was trans- mitted fm East to West: ... Arabic medical knowledge reached western Europe, first through Spain, and then through Sicily and southern Italy, where many Greek-speaking peoples continued to reside. Finally, westerners began traveling to .the -Byzantine capital of Constantinople to seek out Greek originals instead of Arab Wans- lations. One of the kqr groups in the -transmission of Arabic and Greek medical ideas and concepts to the Latin West during the medieval period were the Jewish physicians who traveled in both Islamic and Christian lands. One explanation for the large ndr of Jewish physicians in the medieval period might be that rabbis were encouraged to earn a living outside of the synagogue. Moreover, the rabbi had -the education to acquire the various theoretical concepts about medicine and enough patients to develop effective empirical abili- ties. (97) Given this course of events, it is not surprising that medical schools in the south acquired great reputations; the most prcaninent of which were located at the universities of Salerno, Montpellier, and Bologna. 9 8 Ackerknecht contends that rational medicine was preserved throu&- out Islamic expansion because the East had retained urban centres where knowledge of the conquered Greeks an3 Persians had been translated into Arabic.gg When this information reached the West, scholars, or, mre accurately, teaching orders, such as the Franciscans and bminicans, began to take a new interest in the physical dimensions of healing. As a result, texts began to include material that had been written out of earlier monastic compilations. For example, Constantine's treatises on diets, fevers, urines, pulses, and anatomy reflect a rebirth of rational thought within literary circles. 100 A renewed emphasis on rational concepts and a steady flow of new information tended to increase complexity and specialization in mdical knowledge. Bullough notes that as the pace of new information quickened, so did the method of univer- sity instruction: \"Commentaries had been a comon teaching method since the classical period1' but mw \"instruction was based on the reading and explanation of authoritative texts. 11101 Medicine was, in his opinion, on the threshold of dernization. Organizational developments in the late Middle Ages reinforce the idea that healers were ready to cast off the weight of religion and move into a new era. ?he University of Paris formaated and implemented a curriculum and qualifying examinations that led to a post-graduate degree in medicine. 10 2 derivative of the latin model spread throughout Graduates assumed the title of 'doctort which is verb 'doceret (to teach). This educational Western Europe, and by the fourteenth century, physicians were rot officially acknowledged as such unless they had graduated from a recognized university. 10 3 Wing the monastic period of medical history, educated secular healers had all but disappeared. 10 4 But, as comercia1 centres grew, so did the demand for specialized healers in cmunities . Surgery was performed . lo5 Herba- lists and apothecaries began to prescribe and dispense drugs. It is thought that apothecaries possessed some theoretical knowledge of medi- cine because their title appeared in manuscripts alongside of rnedicu ,A106 and phy&kubf: as opposed to being grouped with cirtwrgi~un.-*~ Regard- less of any previous affiliation with institutional medicine, apothe- caries were, by the fourteenth century, regarded as irregular healers. They ranked with midwives, barbers, herbalists and other types of uneducated specialists. For the most part, and/or restricted their doctors remained in the universities to teach practices to royal and papal patronage. 107 However, despite their favoured position, they needed skills that irregular healers possessed, particularly knowledge in surgery and hgs. For these reasons, Bullou& contends that the impetus for establishing * Medicus and physicus - were used interchangeably with reference to clerical or educated practitioners. .*.... ,. ,. Cimgicus - was the term used to identify irregular or uneducated healers. guilds came, mt from comity-based healers, but from doctors who required their resources to conduct practices. 108 Hence, doctors orches- -trated the formation of several para-professional groups. During the fourteenth century, after many legal disputes, guilds for barbers, barber-surgeons, and apothecaries were commonplace throughout Western cities. Each pup was subject to varying degrees of contml by the university-based physicians because the doctorsv regulatory power depended upon court rulings that were characterized by regional peculiarities. Hospitals represent another important organizational developnent during the late mdieval period. During the second century, Roman rulers built hospitals but they were little mre than shelters for soldiers, crusaders, and disabled people. log 1n the twenfth century, religious orders began to make charitable visits to treat the sick. By the turn of the thirteenth century, hospitals took on mre specific medical functions and their maintenance and regulation was taken over by city administrators. UO While medieval hospitals were generally regarded as t'pestholes\" or as \"a last resort\" (Limits, 1621, the fact that they were linked to institutionalized medicine was an important prelude to the major mle that they would play in medicine's process of mdernization. Thus, healing was cloistered in mnasteries during the Middle Ages. In effect, monks assumed a 'diviner' role while parish priests func- tioned like Babylonian khipu-priests. Knowledge was reworked into concepts that were congrvent with Christian theology and stagnated under the demands of time. Significant changes occurred after the introduction of paper and the rise of commercial centres. Arabic infomtion and classical texts that had been lost to the West since the fifth century were incorporated into Latin writings, thus lending a secular character to knowledge. Medicine was liberated from rigid mnastic con'h?ol and institutionalized into universities. This was followed by the formation of para- professional guilds and the use of hospitals for medical purposes. The importance of these latter developments will become evident in the following part of this thesis, where healing's transformation into mdern medicine is discussed.

It was limited in time to things that could be remembered and it was confined in space to places that were known (hpire, 10). Disease was conceptualized as an evil force and the healer's authority rested with his ability to negotiate the best terms from the offending demns. His power was actualized through stories, chants, massage and surgery -- all of which made sense in terms of magical symbolism. Magic was nothing other than the society's way of abstracting from personal experience and healing was wholly integrated into this cohwent and personal world view. With the introduction of writing, magic was -transposed into religion. Writing endowed civilization with a 'transpersonal memory' by increasing people's capacity for abstract throught: \"individuals applied their minds to symbols rather than things and went beyond the world of concrete experience into the world of conceptual relations created within an enlarged time and space universe1' (Enpire, 10). With the exception of the Greek alphabet, early writing systems were rot easily adapted to spoken language and were, thus, monopolized by priesthoods and/or oligarchies. This had the effect of dividing society into literate and illiterate spheres and, by implication, segmenting healing into piestly and secular realms. Priest healders conceptualized illness as spiritual need states and employed tempal constraints, such as moral law and prayer, as prescriptions or sanctioned sources of satisfaction. Babylonian priests, for example, developed an abs-tract system of classification that broke illness into distinct disease entities that were caused by specific immoral acts, and that were amenable to cure through prayers and other gestures of atonement. Variations upon this theme occurred in Egypt, Greece, and Rome. Priestly power to define ard satisfy health related needs was derived from authority that was couched in sacred texts. Secular healers were often illiterate. While they my have embraced their culture ' s dominant religious beliefs , secular healers emphasized the rational dimension of medicine. They tended to specialize in surgery, mid-wifing, or herbal remedies, and practiced their crafts on a fee-for-service basis. Their autbrity was grounded in folk wisdan and their ability to effect cures. Lacking in priestly or written knowledge, the secular healer's autbrity retained a large measure of pre-literate concreteness. Ekcept for periods in Babylonia, under Hammurabi's rule, and in Rome, under Augustus, purely secular healers rarely achieved 'official' recognition. As a rule, traditional medicine was split between abstract/literate/ religious and concrete/oral/secular knowledge. When priesthoods exer- cised rigid control, medical knowledge was characterized by an emphasis on spiritual phenomena to the near exclusion of physical needs and sources of satisfaction. For example, Babylonian medical texts excluded the &us' craft skills and/or rational kmwledge because of the latter's illiteracy. Similarly, Christian monks rewrote classical texts and deleted many treatises pertaining to the physical dimension of healing. As a result of these temporal biases in medicine, priest healers follmed their texts to the letter and institutionalized healing declined under the pressure of rigid adherence to written precedents. The same pinciple was in operation when medicine was institutiona- lized by secular healers in Hammumbits and Augustus' cen~alized empires In these examples, though, medical kmwledge was characterized by a spatial bias of mmrnunication. The emphasis was on cause and effect relations between physical intervention and treatment outcomes. Needs and sanctioned sources of satisfaction were delineated by rigid civil codes for professional conduct in relationship to the patient's social rank, types of treatments, and forms of payment. Secular healers, within rigid systems of power, also faced severe penalties for deviating from precedent and were superceded by competing and/or religious healing pm&r-* There were, however, periods of stability in traditional medicine; epochs when institutional healers fused priestly and secular knowledge. For example, in Egypt during the third century B.C., tanple priests and secular specialists enjoyed equal status as official healers. Knowledge reflected a balance between spiritual and physical concerns. This was particularly evident in sacred texts that incorporated inmvations by army surgeons. Classical Greece is mst exemplary of achievements in medicine that resulted from flexible interplay between priestly and secular knowledge. Because Greece's healing programs were grounded in a strong oral tradition and because its alplaabet facilitated an open-ended exchange between priests, natural philosophers, and craft-oriented practitioners, medical knowledge escaped rigid institutionalization. Classical medicine reflects, in Innis' terms, an ideal balance between the needs of time and space. Greek healers derived their autbrity from formal or transpersonal legitimations as well as info& or personal sources of knowledge. The selection process for public physicians aptly illuswates the dual nature of authority in classical medicine. In larger cen-tres, where the population could support practitioners on a full-time basis, local authorities would canvas some of the better knm schools for candidates who had studied under famous teachers. Once prospective practitioners had been secured, the balance of the decision to hire rested with oral testimonials as to cures .' Hence, the institutional healer was not authorized to hold a public office on the basis of educational creden- tials alone; his authority was ulthtely granted on the basis of legitimations that arose through personal experience. Classical medicine was, fram Illich's point of view, eminently convivial. Whether it was institutionalized into rigid or manipulatory systems of power or more flexible, or convivial ones, medical education could not be standardized in the strict sense of the term. Because traditional healms lacked the means of systematically rebieving and recording a full range of theoretical and clinical informtion, official knowledge was irregular and loosely woven by dern standards. Traditional medicine was, in Friedson' s words, \"a variety of traditiondl conceptions supplemented by quite variable individual clinical judgement .!12 In this sense, institutional healing was an imprecise art. Because of the subjective and irregular character of medical how- ledge, official healers could rot exercise, what Illich calls, a radical mmpoly. In other words, it was impossible far priests and/or educated secular practitioners to win unilateral public confidence in their services. The Men of proof did mt rest solely with the imputed authority of sacred texts and academic credentials. When institutional medicine failed to produce the desired results, patients could always turn to unofficial sources of expertise. Competition from midwives, rootcutters, barbers and other types of folkhealers, was endemic to traditioral healing programs. It is this factor that leads several sociologists to conclude that the ultimate source of legitimation for a healer's authority rested with subjective evaluations of his/her performance . 3 Thus, fm antiquity to the close of the Middle Ages, medical howledge was institutionalized by groups who controlled the instruments of comunication. Healing was confirmed by temporal biases of corrnnuni- cation when it was monopolized by priesthoods in Babylonia, Egypt, and Rome. Priestly power was established ad maintained through authority that was couched in sacred texts; through knowledge that was shaped by complex systems of writing based on clay, papyrus, and parchment. Medicine was also biased in favour of space in Hmurabi's and Augustus' centralized empires. Official codes for medical practice were written on stone, in Babylonia, and on papyrus, in Fome. Both media lent themselves to the development of a specialized system of writing that favoured relatively precise secular laws and rapid dissemination of information across geographic and cultural barriers . The quintessence of classical Greek medicine, which represents traditional healing in the absence of mompoly, was a synthesis of supernatural ard natural knowledge, combined with objective represen- tations of experience and subjective interpetations of health and disease. Healing was a personal. art; its written rules were open- ended concepts that were continuously adjusted in light of contradic- tory evidence that emerged in practice. Conflict, which was endemic to this loosely structured enterprise, was oriented toward the resolu- tion of practical problem -- toward better ways of healing. This personal and variegated art did not my over into modern day practice because, as Illich contends, certain factors drove a wedge between \"soul and body\" as well as between \"the patient ' s complaint and the physician' s eye\" (Limits, 166). This 'wedge' will be shown to stem from developments in comnunication during the period in which Western medicine was modernized. It is the topic to be discussed in Part Three. FOOTNOTES TO PAF?

PART THREE MODERNIZATION AND THE GRm OF NEW SYSTEMS OF AUTHORITY IN WESTERN MEDICINE PART THREE: INTRODUCTION This part is a discussion of major changes in Western European ~dicine after the introduction of printing. It emphasizes print- related factors that underscored a transfomtion of healing as an art into a unified system of scientific medicine. The process of mderni- zation is presented as a series of three interlocking steps: (1) A period of intellectual and organizational confusion following the inven- tion of the printing press and the erosion of monastic control; (2) A phase of revolutionary changes in education marked by the introduction of written examinations and a return to clinical teaching; and (3) The institutiordization of medicine in reformed universities. The third and final step takes the reader into the twentieth century but stops short of discussing the growth of &ern medicine in relationship to developments in elecMnic communication. The first chapter is a broad overview of events in medicine during the early mdern period ~ich is defined as the epoch beginning in the fifteenth century and ending with the Enlightenment. This was a time when the unified world view that united Christian doctors across Western Europe gave way to regional and national differences. The medieval university system was splintered and weakened; learned societies in lay circles were established; and medical guilds sbngthened their control. The actual practice of medicine renained essentially unaltered from medieval years but the turmoil that characterized healing during the early modern period was an important prelude to radical changes in medical pmctice that crystallized in the nineteenth century. The second chapter focusses on revolutionary activities during the first half of the nineteenth century. It looks at how medical reform was linked to broader social and political changes that were inspired by Enlightenment philosophy. This step toward mdernization is often referred to as the 'hospital revolution' ard/or medicine's 'clinical phase' because, in many cities, doctors were forced out of university debating halls and into city hospitals as bases for teaching. As a result, the emphasis in healing shifted toward observation and away from speculative theorizing. It was also a t% when written examinations were intrduced and used by medical groups to consolidate new interests. The third chapter is a discussion of late nineteenth and early twentieth century developments tkt led modern clinicians back into the universities with a renewed interest in theory -- scientific theory and laboratory-inspired metbds for practice. It also includes references to major factors that entrenched science as the model for medicine's modern mnopoly of knowledge. The assmption that permeates this chapter, and Part Three as a whole, is that scientific doctors' mno- ply over healing was founded on the bias of printed cornrnunication. In the conclusion to this part, I argue that modern medical doctors exercise the same kind of authority that their traditional counterparts enjoyed. In other words, the monopoly of knowledge in modwn medicine is, in many respects, comparable to monopolies that characterized institutional healing programs in traditional empires. But, in one significant way, mdern medical autharity diverges from historical models. Therefore, I conclude that the nature of authority in modern medicine is unparalleled in Western histcuy and that its uniqueness can be seen as an outgrowth of the bias of printed communication. CHAPTER FOUR T!3E EARLY MODERN PERIOD: A SURVEY OF DEVELOPMENTS IN MEDICINE FROM THE FIFTEENTH TO THE NI- CENTURY Since their codities were sponsored and censored by officials as well as consumed by literate groups, the activities of early, printers provide a natural connection between the mvexrtent of ideas, economic developments and affairs of church and state. Elizabeth Eisenstein The early mdern pmiod began in the Renaissance and concluded around the turn of the nineteenth century. In this chapter, I endeavour to captwe a general sense of turmoil that characterized Western medi- cine during these centuries. Early forms of printed comunication are sham to be related to the decline of traditional authority in medicine. Particular emphasis is given to revival mvements that clustered around the mechanical production of sacred medical manuscripts and a rebirth of Kippcratic inspired clinical practice. These early modern revivals are discussed in terms of how they exposed the limitations of -traditional codes of knowledge and furnished a basis for new sources of authority in mdical thought. This discussion is followed by a look at how tradition-bound doctors responded to early modern breaks with inherited wisdom as well as a section on print-related factors that served to strengthen the rise of medical guilds. The chpter concludes with an examination of seven- teenth century censorship issues that resulted in a temporary period of what appeared to be restored order in medicine. FEVIVALS AND REYISIONS IN TRADITIONAL MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE In his social history of healing, Cartwright describes the period beginning in the fifteenth century and exterding to the close of the eighteenth century as a time of 'anarchy' in Western medicine: Changes in communication and -@ansportation \"weakened the power of the church, virtually destroying its temporal authority in England and part of the European continent. \"l His assessment is congruent with Innis who writes : The flexibility of the alphabet and pinting introduced an overwhelmingly divisive influence in Western civilization by emphasizing the place of vernaculars .... By the end of the sixteenth century the mnoply of knmledge built up in relation to prchment had been overwhelmed and a fusion achieved with a new mnoply of kmw- ledge built up in relation to paper in the establishment of separate kingdoms in which the Church was dominated by the state as in Lutheranism an3 Anglicanism (Rnpire, 14 8 . Thus, the early rmdem period was a time of political, economic, and social realignments that appear to stem from the displacement of sacred mnuscripts with new forms of printed communication. The divisive influence of these general developnents registered in medical education. As was mentioned in the preceding chapter, medieval medical schools adopted the educational mdel that originated at the University of Paris. Except for sane studies in anatomy and physiology, doctors were educated in the classics and, because of Church dorriination, shared a comon frame of reference that extended between European cities. This continuity was splintered as cities grew and monarchies strengthened their conml over religion, cmerce, and the professions of law and medicine. Hence, what had been relatively continuous links between university =did centres gave way to a divergent emphasis. The mst dramatic change in medical education began in Italy, where doctors wme the first to seriously entertain anatomical discoveries that are credited to men like Thomas Linacre, Leonardo de Vinci, and Andreas Vesalus, as well as to experiment with physiological and patho- logical treatises that were written by Jean Francois Fernel and Para- celsus . However, Bullough and Friedson, take classical revival mvements and revolutionary thought experiments that emanated from Italy, somewhat for granted. That is to say, they do not address tk question: Why did the weight of traditional codes in medical knowledge lighten and give way to new ways of thinking about the human body? An example of this oversight occurs in n?iedsonts work when he notes that Galents treatises dcsninated medical thought prior to the sixteenth century: So authoritative had his work become by the late Middle Ages that doctors supervising dissections of human cadavers would see no more than what Galen described, even though Galen had apparently never dissected a human ard postulated such patently peculiar features of anatomy as the horned uterus and the five-lobed liver. (3) In recognition of this, however, Friedson does mt probe for factors that might explain why doctors we=- able to cast off the blindfold of tradition when, just prior to the.sixteenth century, they were able to see ody those partsof human anatmy that corresponded to Galenic codes? Elizabeth Eisenstein is one historian who searches for answers to such questions. In her book, The Printing Press as an Agent of Change, 4 she presents some illuminating evidence in support of Innis' idea that printing underscored the early modern collapse of religious power and the formation of secularrmnopolies of knowledge. While she does not address Innist work, or the subject of medicine, specifically, her research is used here to supply sme missing links between the fall of monastic medicine and the rise of modern scientific thought in medical circles. Latin manuscripts that carried medical howledge through the dark ages into the Renaissance were characterized by a blend of rational and spiritual ideas or, as Eisenstein states, \"Scientific inquiries about 'hm the heavens got were linked with religious concerns about 'how to go the heaven' . '15 Because monastic scribes hand copied informtion and because traditional scholars were \"trained to win 'victory in debate' rather than to 'search for the trutht1', Eisenstein contends that traditional codes of knowledge were irregular and unspecialized. ?his idea is reinforced by Thomas Kuhnts observation that writers in natural philosophy, prior to the scientific revolution, were \"able to take no cmn body of belief for granted\" and that there \"was no standard set of methods or of phemmena\" to which scholars were obliged to conform. 7 Like Innis, Eisenstein argues that the character of knowledge changed as printing changed the conditions under which knowledge was produced. * In terns of classical revival movements in Italy, print furnished Renaissance scholars with new forms of communication through which to look at old information and to, paradoxically, critique and surpass the very roots they set out to discover. Concurrently, printing provided the means whereby scholars could speak to one another and to the world in a novel fashion. Thus, printing via mveable type, changed the processes of assessing and amending tradition formulae: First, it exposed unforeseen errors in traditional codes of knowledge and, second, it resulted in an entirely new way of producing scientific knowledge. Revisions to traditional codes did not involve, merely, the bracketing of emrs and the insertion of missing pieces but, rather, an overall recasting of the mold into which kncwledge would fit. Vesaluis' retrieval and reproduction of Galen's mrk is an example of how the bias of printed camnunication played a major role in classical revival and its subsequent demise. Like many scholars of his time, Vesaluis was : ... aiming at reconstituting, reforming, and amending rather than replacing or discarding an ancient art. 'Anatomy will soon be cultivated in our academies,' he wrote hopefully, 'as it was of old in Alexandria.' He sought to 'restore from the world of the dead the knowledge of the parts of the hwn body that had died long ago' -- to cm closer to a 'pristine' knmledge that had become corrupted and confused. (9) His intentions may well never have been formulated nor, indeed, acted upon, had it not been for the reproduction and circulation of tradi- tional laowledge in new forms of comunication like printed textbooks and journals. Unlike scribal scblars , who were restricted by the time- consuming process of handcopying, Vesaluis gained access to a wide range of hitherto lost or frappnted texts, and he set the task of restoring Galen's work to its original form. But, as Eisenstein notes, \"full recovery of the Galenic corpus was merely a prelude to an era that saw Men surpassed. \"lo Thus, despite Vesaluis ' intentions, senething served to violate the spirit of his revival and restoration of Galenic codes of knowledge. That 'something' appears to be printed cmunication. Early modern revivals of medical knowledge differed from those that began in the Middle Ages because the bias of print resulted in an entirely unexpected and novel reorientation. That is to say, print-using scholars, like Vesaluis, were ale to see old information in a new way. The very act of retrieving and compiling scattered descriptions and theories associated with Galenic anatomy, opened a window through which my eyes could gaze. For the first time, Vesaluis and his readers were able to see discrepancies that existed between Galen's observations and theories about anatomical functions. They saw, for example, that Galen had observed cattle and monkeys, and that he had incorrectly extrapolated this data to the unseen workings of the human body. U. When one considers that Vesaluis had the benefit of scanning Galen's work in total, as well as comparing it to clearly labelled diagrams of human dissections, it stands to reason that he would detect errors that had escaped the attention of scribal scholars. Eisenstein maintains that print fostered a new kind of trust in \"one' s own eyes 1'12 which, ultimately, resulted in the extirpation of Waditional codes of knowledge : The 'attitude of scrupulous diligence' toward 'observation' and 'description of factual data' exhibited by Vesaluis and some of his fellow anatomists has been singled out by many authori- ties ... the new attitude placed '-baditional frames of knowledge ... in a crisis situation.' (13) The crisis for traditional codes of knowledge rested with the fact that new processes of appraisal ran counter to old processes of production. Philosophical exposes that made sense to scribal scholars looked incorrect in the eyes of early mdern scholars. Apxrt from lending themselves to comparative studies that exposed errors in traditiord codes of knowledge, printed forms of communication also released medicine and other branches of knowledge from a closed corpus and replaced traditional production processes with an \"open- ended investigatory process. \"14 For example, early in the seventeenth century, William Harvey, while studying in Italy, successfully completed the first experiment that demns-ated the value of the scientific method for medical practice. Aided by microscopes and inductive reason- ing, he discovered how blood circulates, while simultaneously disproving Galen's sacred ebb and flow theory: - ~an&nis in Animalibus (16 28 is not only a medical classic but the first true text book of experimental physiology. His ' circulation of the blood' was ro mere speculation, but positive fact proved by rational observation and experiment. (15) As Cartwright notes, Harvey's book was the first example of medicine ' s departure from medieval speculative theorizing and a mve toward com- bining Bacon's inductive reasoning with Ikscartest mtion of the body as machine. Harvey's work triggered a &in of follow-up experiments by men like Fbbert Ebyle, Robert Hooke, and John Mayow, whose cda- tive efforts established the basic principles of circulatory and respiratory physiology; all of which were in print and disseminated among learned circles by the end of the seventeenth century. 16 While Italy was a primary source of revolutionary ideas, northern medical schools, such as kyden, Glasgow, and Edinburgh, became known for their outstanding teachers who translated new ideas into bedside medicine. Early in the eighteenth century, after the release of Carl Linn6's (Linnaeus) botanical discoveries, several physicians adapted Iiim6's system of classifying plants to ordering observations pertaining to the symptoms of diseases. For example, Hemnn Boerhaave of Leyden and William Cullen of Glasgow and Edinbmgh, revived the ancient 17 practices of observing, recording, and clinical teaching. They opened clinics in affiliation with irniversity medical sc~ls and attracted students from all over Europe. In the last half of the seventeenth century, after Hippomatic inspired teaching mthods were reintroduced, doctors in Scotland and the Netherlands began to see the value of reuniting smgery with internal medicix. Their goal was strengthened by Lavoisier's theory of oxi- dation, which sparked the chemical revolution. This radical turn of thought was soon followed by Joseph Black!s discovery of carbon dioxide gas, which led to the invention of anaesthetics; all of which increased the precision and status of surgery.18 Despite these developnents, however, most European doctors regarded clinical medicine and surgery with a jaundiced eye -- especially in London, Paris ard Fome . DEFENDERS OF THE STATUS QUO Medical schols in Leyden and Edinburgh were part of the earliest 'open' universities where students were admitted regardless of race or status. l9 Because of this factor, university educated doctors, surgeons, and apothecaries tended to co-operate. However, this was not the case in London and Paris where doctors were very status conscious and anxious to protect their traditional authority. Bullough contends that the growth of cities, monarchies, ard universities embled physicians to gain important allies in their attempts to limit the field for non- aligned healers : Lawyers, higher clergy, and physicians could approach one another as equals and each used their influence to bolster the other: the higher clergy through episcopal or papal sanctions, the lawyers through their influence on kings and bishops. The physicians justified this new support through their emphasis on the higher ethic of the univer- sity practitioner. (20) 'Ihese general patterns were mst evident in bndon and Paris, which became centres for political battles and, eventually, the places where reform mvements gathered public support to change the structure of medicine in the nineteenth century. Cespite extraordinary transitions in medical thought in some northern and southern universities, Fhrisian doctars continued a secure patronage system and the sanctification of their discipline within a traditional curriculum'. They placed a high premium on a liberal arts education, valued skills in disputation, and rarely examined a patient prior to graduation. 21 \"disease is a function function of His mercy, They regarded their of tk wrath of God, and the physician is vocations as a sacred : healing medicines are a 2 2 His instrument. \" In many respects, they retained medieval concepts and values an3 virtually ignored innovative trends in Italy and the Netherlands. In bndon the situation was comparable. In 1518, Henry VIII granted regulatory power to the Royal College of Physicians on the basis of curbinb \"the audacity of those wicked men wb shall profess medicine mre the the sake of their avarice than frm the assurance of any good conscience. \"23 The 'good conscience ' that is mentioned in the king' s charter implies agreemnts between gentlemen of the Church of England; agreements that were directed at excluding doctors of different religious backgrourads as well as limiting kgular healers. Officially, licentiates in -the College were men who had graduated in physics, fm the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Dublin and Edinburgh. Infodly, though, Fellows were often denied entry if they had not graduated from one of the universities in London. This had the effect of excluding men who were not ders of the Church of England. 24 Furthermore, if an Irish or Scottish Fellow was admitted to the College, his lack of social conwctions in London high society would invariably reduce his chances of securing favourable patrons. 'Ihese factors led one historian to conclude that London's Royal Society was the last group of doctors to recognize the growing importance of basing professional 25 membership on pmf of medical competence. The issue of competency was at the core of medical reforms that upset the status quo early in the nineteenth century. THE RISE OF MEDICAL GUILDS Up until the Great Plague of 1665, the apothecaries guild was subject to stringent regulatory control by the Ebyal College in London. 26 When the doctors left the city for relative safety in the countryside, apothecaries took advantxge of their regulators' absence and emerged as the principle source of medical care for London's growing population. They established stronger lines of comnunication within city limits, and identified themselves as healers* by severing affiliations with grocers and druggists. Disassociation from the retail aspect of their craft * As opposed to drug retailers. enabled apothecaries to circumvent the Societyfs subsequent attempts to 2 7 revoke their prescriptive powers. Other factms that furthered the apomecaries' cause came by way of developments in cmerce: the patent system was adapted to a growing drug industry, and the penny press lent itself to advertising the marvels of various tonics and powders. In fact, patent medicine was so popular during this time that it became, in Bullough s words, \"the mainstay of newspaper advertising until almost the twentieth century. l1 28 While there is no evidence to suggest that these drugs were more effective than other remedies of the time, there are reasons to believe that, at the very least, drugs were the most agreeable and risk-free form of existing treatments. Andrew Allentuck believes that drug therapy involved the least danger to patients because of continuous links with ancient wisdom: lXlring the two and half mellenia that passed frm the time of ancient Greece to the end of the nineteenth century, western medicine had about four dozen basic drugs, most derived from plants, and the risk of adverse reaction was minimized through long experience with them. (29) Hence, because drugs were the least damaging of existing therapies and because mass demand for them had been generated by the press, the courts continued to rule in the apothecaries' favour on matters pertaining to 3 0 regulation. Apothecary guilds across Western Empe soon followed the British lead. Surgeons were, by regarded with fear and was the case in London all accounts, despised by The Royal Society, and suspicion by the population at large. 31 This because surgeons were often foreigners and lacking classical training, thereby making them unacceptable to the status conscious doctors. The public associated thm with sensational news- paper stories about the body-snatching trade. Bad press about the surgeons' practice of dissection persisted until legal channels for protecting cadavers were established in the early eighteen hundreds. 32 But, until that time, surgeons were compelled to practice in the provinces and/or the my. In Paris, surgeons tried to divest themselves of association with the barbers by establishing their own college and by dating the unspecialized approach to medicine that was valued by internists or university educated This prompted Parisian doctors to form an alliance with the barbers that eventually undermined the surgeons' attempts to attract clients within city limits. Thus, french surgeons were, as in London, forced into country towns and the army. 34 In the final analysis, the surgeons ' banishment to the periphery of the doctors' control, worked in their favour. In Englarad, for example, surgeons consolidated their interests in provincial towns by organizing solo practices ad referral systems, support for their services increased refined -- largely through their use tion as teaching methods, and partly and Harvey' s discoveries. Because clinics, and schools. Public as surgical techniques were of direct observation and dissec- through the application of Vesaluis' surgeons were mt, in Reader's - - words, 'hampered by veneration of the classics , \"jb they were able to adopt same of the important scientific ideas that were emnating from learmed societies and printing houses -- ideas that were regarded as heresies by the tradition-bound doctors in hdon and Paris. As a result, surgeons enhanced the precision of their craft and their reputa- tions as healers rose in the public's estimation. By the middle of the eighteenth century, doctors, apothecaries, and surgeons had acquired distinct identities and the boundaries for practice had been etched by regulatory provisions. They mintained an aggressive posture toward one another, but had resolved major territorial disputes by appealing to quite separate markets. They emerged as the mst favoured groups of healers by local and national governments. This is not to suggest, however, that other kinds of healers were forced out of competition. In fact, quackery was rampant because of new cmercial incentives that came along with industrialization. Medicine shows were comn spectacles in market areas in villages and cities. Some healers were accompanied by comedians to entertain and attract a mwd before the patent medicines were displayed and sold or while surgeons demonstrated the latest techniques. 37 According to Friedson, this state of affairs persisted into, and throughout, the nineteenth century. No single group of healers could prove that they were mre competent than the other and hence, could not create widespread pblic confidence in any prticular service. 3 8 Despite same extraordinary changes in thought during the early modern period, the state of the medical arts had not really changed 3 9 since the Middle figes. ESzcept for some innovations in surgery and drugs, healing was at one of its lowest points in history. Preventive medicine was virtually unknown, and curative measures were often more dangerous than no treatment whatsoever. In terms of the scientific revolution, mst doctors failed to appreciate the implications that new ideas held for medical practice. According to sociologist, Phillip Elliott , scientific discoveries had generated interest in university medical schools but, by the eighteenth century, the \"novelty of the scientific revolution has worn off. 1140 For the most part, doctors clung to traditional codes of knmledge and, as Cartwright notes, continued to depend upon the 'five senses' for diagnoses and treatment and continued the medieval practice of 'care' as opposed to 'cure'. 41 They were more preoccupied with territorial disputes than they were with improving or changing the basis of treatment and the quality of care. CENSORSHIP AND THE SILENCING OF SCIENCE Elliott's observation, that scientific ideas hd lost their appeal in established medical schools, is consistent with Eisenstein's research. She found tht printing ventures surrounding important and controversial studies by noted scientists like Galileo, Halley, Newton and Harvey, began to wind down because of new controls enacted by the Catholic Church. She notes that experiments and theories abated and warnings, such as the following, appeared in private letters that circulated between scientists: \"It is dangemus to make original conjectures, so look again before giving it to a printer. 1142 The great embryologist, Malpighi , exemplifies the bind in which scientists were caught. His work was delayed as he had to secure technical literature from England because local booksellers were for- bidden to deal in many subject areas. For the same reasons, he had to conceal his discoveries for fear that he would suffer a heretic ' s fate . 4 3 As it turned out, Phlpighi's treatise on the silk mrm won him acclaim. He, like many other scientific virtuosos on the continent, found support for his ideas in Britain, where the anti-papal cause was strongest. 44 This is not to suggest that England was exempt from censorship pblems but, rather, the task of defining true science had been taken out of full public view. Members of the Royal Society established printing guidelines that enabled intellectuals to prudently debate controversial issues. To this effect, Eisenstein writes: In securing support for the new form of 'public knowledge', the founders of the Royal Society used tactics similar to those deployed by Mersenne. They took care to present the study of nature in its most neutral, innocuous guise; -treading a cautious middle path between Hobbits 'atheistical on the one hand and occult ' Familiastical-levelling Ikgical ' trends on the other. Even while upholding claims to Reformation, welc~g contributions from artisans, and advo- cating the use of unadorned vernacular prose, Bishop Sprat emphasized the apolitical non- partisan character of the Society. Not only poetry and magic, but also religion and politics were banned. There is more than a hint of a suggestion in Sprat's apologia that the neutral scientific society had taken over functions once assigned to the medieval Church by providing a peaceful sanctuary for factions who were otherwise at each other's throats. (45) ?\"nus, through the efforts of this learned society, the task of defining the contours of lanowledge was taken out of the public's domain; it was encased in a new language that, by necessity, involved speaking to issues in a neutral tone. It is important to note tht the politics of censorship appear to underscore the transformation of science as an open investigatory process into an elitess venture tht employed a complex system of writing. It was at this point in history, that a potentially convivial tool was converted into a manipulatory one. Prim to the middle of the seventeenth century, the Camonwealth of Learning, represented by journals associated with the Royal Society in bndon, Academic des Sciences in Paris, and Accademia dei Lincei in Rane, exchanged novel ideas, regardless of their sources, and in the absence of distinctions between '-tmrel and pseudo science, Eisenstein clarifies this point in the following quote: From Paracelsus through Mesmer and on to the present, the press has lent itself to the purpose of pseudo-scientists as well as those of real scientists, and it is not always easy to tell the two groups apart. Distinguishing between scientific jour~ls and sensational journalism is relatively simple at present. But during the early years of the Royal Society when sightings of monsters and marvels were still being credited and recorded, the two genres were easily confused. Confusion was further compounded by the workings of the Index which lumped dull treatises on physics with mre sensational forbidden tracks and transformed advocacy of Copernicanism into a patriotic Protestant cause. (46) However, by the late eighteen hundreds, mnoplies were built around new I forms of communication that were devoted to Itrue' scientific knowledge. The politics of censorship fostered a new way of writing that purified the Comnwealth of Learning of prior association with what Eisenstein calls the \"soul of nature\" and advanced scientists in the pursuit of \"mechanistic\" truths. 4 7 Thus, while traditional medical doctors, particularly in Paris and London, concentrated on maintaining the status quo, new alignments between scientists, surgeons, apothecaries, and social reformers, were being forged. These latter groups began to organize around and through printing ventures associated with learned journals, magazines, and text- books. btivated by the spirit of Enlightenment philosophy, and backed by printers, they began to prepare a case against the traditional medical profession. The result was that, early in the nineteenth century, university doctors were overthrown and medicine fell into step with revolutions in science, industry an3 philosophy.

Susan Sontag Hospitals, as we know them today, are relatively recent develop- ments in medical history. They began in Paris at the turn of the nine- teenth century when doctors were forced out of the university and obliged to practice in city clinics. As a result, Parisian doctors began to regard their vocations in a different light and set themselves the task of re-defining medical problems. They, in effect, created modern diseases within the milieux of nineteenth century clinics. This is the subject of the first section in this chapter. Clinical medicine stirred the imaginations of social reformers who began to connect the idea of cmpetence and/or demonstrated mastery of skills, with medical licensing and pmfessiond authority. These reformers, particularly in Britain, used the press to denounce traditional medical education and to convince govermnt officials that standardized written examinations were a more enlightened measure of the value of a practitioner's knowledge. Thus, the mtion of written proof of compe- tency supplanted the traditional virtues of oral debating skills and cultured gentility as criteria for conferring authority and status to healers. Tnis topic is discussed in the second and concluding segments of the chapter. CLINICS AND THE CREATION OF MODERN DISEASES The dawn of the nineteenth century is best described as a period when laymen were very active in health related mattws. This orienta- tion began during the last half of the eighteenth century when Voltaire, Rousseau, and other philosophers of the Enlightenment, wrote about the virtues of rational approaches to problem-solving. Medical reformers, guided by dern rationality, thoroughly rejected a lingering belief that disease was the result of evil deeds. They also dismissed a revived classical notion that clhtic conditions were primarily respn- sible for illness. Instead, they focussed on industrialization and regarded social change as the only means of improving appalling health conditions in cities, armies, navies, prisons, and hospitals.' As one historian notes : The need for sanitary reform emphasized the need for social reform in general .... Hence the liberal movements that developed in all Western nations between 1820 and 1848, in opposition to the reactionary governments of that period, were closely associated with the mvement for sanitary reform. It was no accident, for instance, that such a medical mster as Virchow sympathized with the Revolution of 1848; or that on the other hand, Friedrich Engels prepared his indictment of English society largely in terms of unnecessary disease and death. (2) In this sense, medical issues occupied a fronteentre position in the revolutionaq dramas of the early nineteenth century. The work of noted reformers such as John Howard's indictment of sanitary conditions in British prisons, and J.R. Tenon's expos6 on the 3 inhumane treatmnt of patients in Parisian hospitals, created wide- spead public support for medical reform. But change did not occur until the conbol ard privileged position of university educated doctors was shaken. This first bppened in Paris, during the revolution of 1789, when doctors of the Ancien Rggime were forced out of the university and into hospitals as bases from which to continue teaching.4 Hence, a turning ping for medicine was its departure from the context of libraries and debating halls and its entry into hospitals that were being transfomd disease' (Limits, from shelters into what Illich calls 'museums of 167). Nineteenth century Parisian hospitals were reminiscent of the great schools of classical Greece and the early modern clinics in Scotland and the I\\Jethevllands, in terms of basing bwledge on direct observation. But, according to Ackerlaecht, there were three significant differences between pre and post-revolutionary clinics: To begin with, it was large-scale. While the fmus clinic of Boerhaave consisted of only six beds for men d six beds for women, Ebuillard, one of the leaders of the Paris Clinical School, could boast of having seen twenty-five thousand cases within five years. Furthermore, nineteenth century clinical observation was no longer the passive art practiced by clinicians from Hippo- crates to Sydenham and Boerhaave; it was trans- formed into- active examinat ion t&ugh the large- scale application of new and revived methods of physical diagnosis. Fi~lly, observation was no longer concerned with unexplained symptoms, but with symptoms considered in the light of lesions found at the autopsy table. (5) Hence, clinical education &came a large-scale enterprise in which patients figured as objects for study -- both while they were living and after death. Traditional taboos against handling corpses were superceded by modevln ideas about death such as those that appeared in the writings of Paracelsus: \"A man's death is nothing but the end of his daily work, an expiration of air, the consumnation of his innate balsamic self- curing power, the extinction of the rational light of nature.... ,,6 Human life ad death were taken out of the realm of metaphysics and conceptualized as natural phenamena . As the method of from university-based specula- tion and theorizing to first-hand observation in clinical settings, the way that health and illness were thought about, also changed. Illich contends that Parisian hospitals were the places where modern diseases were invented and where health related needs were first stardardized: \"If 'sickness' and 'health' were to lay claim to public resources, then these concepts had to be made operational\" (Limits, 165). This standar- dization process owed much to a precise, mathematical and neutral language, as well as innovations in measuring devices that came from printers. Printing workslaops, according to Eisenstein, had become centres for the exchange of ideas and artifacts between scientists, craftsmen, artists, reckon-masters , mechanics, preachers, merchants, bureaucrats, and a variety of enterprising laymn . 7 Products that were outgrowths of printing ventures altered the way that clinicians approached the problem of diagmsing illness. For example, cylinders added precision to the ear, enabling doctors to match the sounds that emanated fm patientst chests to lesions that were found later, during autopsies. For these reasons, Laennec chose the word 'stethoscope' for his invention; it is derived from the Greek 8 mrds for 'chest' and 'I view'. Similarly, John watch' improved the accumcy of a clinician's sense of touch while 9 determining pulse rates. Thermometers were adapted for clinical use and gave doctors a visual reading of what had traditionally been subjective assessments of hot, warm, cool, and cold body temperatures. 10 In short, ins-truments added precision to sensory based observations by representing experience according to visual, objective, and quanti- fiable signs. This is consistent with Innis' view that the bias of printed cammunication predisposed individuals to appraise problems in mechanized and/or standardized terms. 11 Because the way that nineteenth century clinicians appraised problems had changed, it stands to reason that their approach to solu- tions was also altered. The ~aditional emphasis on 'caring' for the sick ws transposed into a weoccupation with documenting problems. Thus, clinical examinations rarely led to treatment plans but, rather, observations were communicated as data that was charted and graphed to represent new disease entities, rates of illnesses, and patterns of . epidemics. Tkis information was catalogued according to new, and ever increasing, specializations such as pathological anatomy, dermatology, syphilology, psychiatry, pediatrics, and public health. bst of this data did not lend itself to improving treatmnt or effecting cures but, rather, was proof positive that public health standards were in desperate need of corrective action. Clinicians began to formulate grand-scale solutions to problems and/or needs that were being defined an3 stadardized in hospitals. Reformers who sat on the Paris Public Health Council recommended that internal and external medicine as well as pharmacology be unified and centralized into one system of government supported health care. They argued that public expenditures for centralized medicine were justifiable on the basis of 'public servicet, 'public interestt, this movement enlivened similar groups 14 across Europe, especially in Vienna, Dublin, ard London. However, their attempts to unify ~dicine were blocked because no one was able to prove that modern clinicians could actually satisfy public health needs that had been defined and exposed. In short, local governments were not willing to confer mnopolistic powers to groups who could not demons-trate superior canpetence in healing. TOWARD REFORMING MEDICAL EDUCATION As it happened, developments in Lordon pmvided the next crucial step toward modernizing medicine. In the nineteenth century, a new breed of medical men travelled frm Dublin, Edinburgh and the continent to establish teaching clinics in London. The Royal College of Physicians remained aloof and, apart from a few token clinics, refused to abandon 15 the traditional patronage system. The new clinicians impressed government officials because they were willing to treat the masses. They introduced the variolation method of preventing small pox;:': used accurate medical statistics to record disease rates and causes of deaths; and recommended improvements for sewers, water supplies and 16 housing. Most of these innovations resulted in noticeable improve- ments -- so much so, that England took the lead medicine became kmwn as a social science. 17 Within three decades, statistical evidence in public health and of improved standards in public health provided a cogent rationale far reformers to investi- gate university education with a view to challenging the competence of physicians in the College. When proceedings began in the Select Cormittee on Medical Education, the physicians failed to respond to the issue of practical and socially useful knowledge. Instead, they Method used before Edward Jenner perfected the vaccination method. defended their superordinate position on the basis of a liberal arts education and social standing: ... by the beginning of the nineteenth century defenders of the physicianst position as privi- leged caste were prepared to argue simply in terms of their social standing. As one witness to the Select Conunittee on Medical Education of 1834 put it, classical learning an3 general cultivation of the mind were necessary if the physician was not to be found at a loss in the great houses of the land which it was his duty to enter. (18) When physicians were pressed for information about the extent and nature of their medical knowledge, it kcam clear to the committee that, in Reader's words, \"Physicians prided thelves on being.learned rrien, but not especially on their medical learning ... because there was little to be medically learned about. \"19 The doctorst case was further impabed by the revelation that university examinations were entirely oral, thus leaving them with no documents to present as proof that medical knowledge, however limited, had been mastered by Fellows of the College. 20 These findings generated a host of debates about the relationship of education to medical competence which were developed and circulated via publications such as The Lancet, Transactions, Saturday Review, The Student ' s Guide, Fortnightly Review, and The Economist. 21 The physicians ' desire to maintain a traditional liberal arts curriculum, and their capacity to convey the virtues of unspecialized howledge, was seriously impaired by attitudes held by the editors of The Lancet and 'k,ansactions. For example, Thomas Wakley, editor of The lancet, was a friend of Henry Warburton who chaired the Select Committee on Medical Education. They shared the view that public health would profit if theory and practice were united; if doctors, surgeons, and apothecaries were unified through a centralized educational system. Thus, according to Reader, \"witnesses were given every chance to put the case for a unified profession and the conservatives who gave evidence were very searchingly examined. \"22 Lancett s coverage of these hearings was biased in a similar manner. A push to reform.medica1 education also cam via Transactions. In its preface, the editors expressed the intention of exchanging practical knowledge toward the end of unifying internal medicine with surgery. 23 This journal was largely responsible for reversing the impact of bad press that degraded surgeons during the early modern period. It frequently reported on the discoveries that surgeons had made during tks of war, and in civic life . 2 4 surgeons to lobby encouraged the public to accept surgeons as 'gentlement Essentially, Transactions was the vehicle that enabled for public support; to exterd their influence beyond the army and the provinces; and to establish clinics an3 schools in association with prestigious city hospitals. Despite a hightened awareness that medicine would be better equipped to met social needs by poling educational resources, the problem of proving competence in relationship to education remined unresolved. It was at this point that the apothecaries guild emerged as a leader. It had established a formal written examination system that validated the mastery of knowledge by licence holders. This stringent examination policy was the factor that convinced legislators to pass The Apothecaries Act which, in Reader' s words : ...g ave the Society of Apothecaries pawer to determine the education required fcnr, entry into their pmfession, to examine for proficiency, and on the results of examinations to grant or withhold licences which alone muld authorize their holders to call themselves apothecaries. Moreover, the Act gave -the Society power to prevent unqualified persons frm calling them- selves apothecaries anywhere in England or Wales. These powers were quite unprecedented at the time. Both byal Colleges were examining bodies, but the Surgeons hd no power to prevent anyone frm calling himself a surgeon, qualified or not, and even the august Fhysicians' authority, founded on a Royal Charter, oriLy extended to London and the diswict seven miles about. (25) Hence, written exams became a key to resolving the ccanpetency issue and, in large measure, they provided the kind of proof that governments req-d to support a mnoply in medicine. The Apothecaries Act paved the way for the Medical Act in 1858, which was the first grand-scale move tmard eliminating competition in medicine. It made provisions for a registry of practitioners which included only those men who had demonstrated written mastery in specia- lized areas of knowledge. The Act also sanctioned licensed practitioners to exercise self-discipline: They could con-1 who entered the profes- sion and strike from the registry those who failed to cmply with internal standards. 26 It was through these provisions that physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries fondly laid claim to hospital resources. The Medical Act, in Britain, was similar to the creation of the Central School of Health in Paris and, within a few decades, other European centres had enacted similar legislation. Despite the fact that nineteenth century clinicians had won large concessions from local governments, they were a long way fram monop- lizing medicine. Friedson notes that they had failed to win unilateral public confidence ard, apart fm hospitalized patients, they had no means of ensuring that people wuld seek their services. 2 7 Neither the wealthy nor the poor were particularly faithful to licensed practitioners and non-aligned healers continued to compete in the medical market. bause contends that clinicid medicine had reached its logical ' conclusion by the second half ot the nineteenth century because reformers had emphasized social problems at the expense of recognizing the value of innovations in 'pure' science : \"Pasteur , for example, was ignored at this time, for the comment was made that the microscope was 'not particularly useful' and those working with it not to be considered seriously . \"28 Clinicial medicine had satisfied sane public health needs but it had failed to provide cures for mst of the diseases that had been defined. Ackerknecht's assessment concurs with that of Krause. He claims that advances in hospital-based education had reached a dead end by approximately 1850. 29 The pmblan stemmed frm the fact that clinicians were measuring symptoms but tky did rot understand the causes of diseases. Heme, treatments were limited to experimenting with symptom reduction and, in most cases, -h.eatment outcomes could not be predicted. F'urfhermore, in the absence of predictive per, clinicians were unable to secure govermnt sanctions to mropolize healing. The problem facing nineteenth century clinicians, therefore, was to find ways of proving superior competency: first in being able to predict treatment outcmes; and second, to indicate that they could continue to progress in the future. The answers cam in the secord half of the nineteenth century when medicine returned to the universities and aligned itself with pure science.

TKE LABORATORY REVOLUTION: AN EXAMINATION OF CHANGES IN MEDICAL EWCATION AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF MODERN PROFESSIONAL AmORITY All professions are conspiracies against the laity. George Bernard Shaw This chapter highlights the final stanza of medicine's dernization. It covers a time span of approximately sixty years, beginning in the middle of the nineteenth century and concluding in the second decade of the twentieth century. During these years the modern profession of medicine was formally organized and doctors consolidated their authority. This began when nineteenth century clinicians adopted mthodologies and discoveries from the laboratories of 'pure' scientific researchers. Clinics, en effect, became extensions of laboratories ; the latter of which attracted considerable support from private and public funding bodies. Secondly, medical education mved back into the universities where doctors were educated as scientists and acquired institutional supports to promote dern service ethics. Thirdly, the public learned that scientific doctors were superiar to other kinds of healers and patients' perceptions of need began to correspond to doctors' perceptions of service. And, finally, university educated doctors acquired powers to police themselves and a ping number of aligried para-professionals. At the same time, they were legally sanctioned to eliminate competing healers and mandatory consumption of scientific medicine was enforced. CUNICS AS EXTENSIONS OF ESEARCH LABORATONES Ihtil the middle of the nineteenth century, clinical medicine and pure science were quite separate activities. Clearly, practitioners were influenced by revolutionary thought experbnts, but they, and government officials, were rot convinced that laboratory science could lend itself to solving problems that had been identified in relation to public health. A radical change in attitudes occurred as a result of the work of German scientists who were:tk first researchers to be supported by public funds. Ackerknecht suggests that because its universities were modernized without a revolution, the ref omed educa- tional system in Germany favoured the development of laboratory medicine. 1 Interestingly, Germany had not produced many outstanding clinicians during the first part of the nineteenth century. But, during the next fifty years, it took a leading role in medical discoveries that resulted in the eventual marriage of clinical practice to speculative research. The most significant contributions, of German scientists, emerged from improvements that they made to microscopes and the invention of staining methods. These tools extended the power of sight to reveal the structure of cells and chemical campounds which, in turn, lent credence to the theory that epidemics were caused by micro-organisms.' Resear- chers, inspired by that assumption, began to isolate causative agents and to develop preventive and curative measures for diseases that clinicians and reformers had identified as the greatest threats to public health. Hence, through the work of Koch and other German micro- scopists, practitioners were able to treat the cause of tuberculosis, cholera, gonorrhea, typhoid fever, pneumonia, plague, and syphillis. In a brief span of approximately thirty years, 1875 to 1906, causes and cures were discovered for aver twenty diseases. 4 ?he science of bacteriology atwacted considerable attention from private and public funding bodies across mpe. Government officials and entrepreneurs began to appreciate the practical rewards of supporting speculative reseamh. The story of Pasteur is a case in point: As a specialist in micro-organisms he was now widely sought by govermnt and private organiza- tions to help save French irdus-tries, menaced by processes which seemed to be the work of micro- organisms. His study of the diseases of wine led to his invention in 1863 of the process that still bears his name, \"pasteurization\". He studied the diseases of the silkworm in 1865 and the diseases of beer in 1871. Pastern's successful identifi- cation of the responsible micro-organisms saved important branches of the F'rench economy from ruin. (5) Later, Pasteur extended his research to include diseases of higher animals and, in 1880, he perfected a vaccine for rabies. This and other 'useful' discoveries prompted the French goverment to establish a research institute in his name. Clearly, the interests of science, clinical medicine, governments and industry were dove-tailing. The implications for ~112dical practice were most noticeable in the specializations of dietetics and pathology. In the first case, scien- tists had discovered the dyMmics of metabolism. This meant that, for the first tk in history, therapeutic diets could be prescribed with kmwledge of why and how they were effective. Up until the late nine- teenth cenhrry, dietetics had been an entirely -trial and error art. b As for pathology, Virchow's research took gross anatomical descriptions from clinical records, and transformed them into microscopical anatomy. 7 Hence, physicians and surgeons began to see beyond body organs and connecting tissues that were visible on the autopsy table. And, by the same token, practitioners increasingly looked to science for answers to questions that could not be answered in clinical contexts. According to Ackerknecht, this was reflected in jourmals where Virchow was referred to as the 'pope' of medicine: \"It is significant of the spirit of the times that this role of leadership was now assumed by a laboratory man.\" 8 At the turn of the twentieth century, laboratories were medical practice and, as Reiser notes, the scientific method central to had replaced traditional clinical protocol: The doctor who depended chiefly on technology in diagnosing and following the course of illness could think of himself as using the same rigorous metbds as did the scientist who pursued truth in his laboratory. To many doctors, the laboratory \"seemed pervaded by a purer light\" than the hospital ward, and the laboratory analyst was pictured as superior to the clinician -- Yhe incarnation of all that is scientific in medicine and whose word cannot be questioned.\" (9) Hospitals, once considered pestholes, were modernized: nursing care was upgraded, antiseptics improved hygienic standards, drugs were controlled; and well equipped laboratories were installed. All of these features contributed to a new attitude towards hospitalization. These institutions were held to be one of the coun'try's chief assets and places where the best medical care was available. 10 MEDICAL EDUCATION AND REFORED UNIVERSITIES In a span of approximately forty years, laboratory medicine became the paramount model for delivery of health services in most European centres. &spite its rapid grmth, laboratory medicine met considerable opposition. For example, conservatives, who clung to the belief that physicians should be well rounded and versed in the classics, objected to the specialized and skill-oriented nature of modern clinicians. Hospitalization and extensive use of diagnostic equipnt escalated costs in medicine. Rzrtherr~re, citizens were reluctant to abandon personal ties to irregular healers until they were convinced that scientific practitioners were, indeed, more competent than other healers, and that they were people who could be trusted with personal health problems. Several developments in education during the latter part of the nineteenth century served to appease medicine's dewactors and to cement and extend the control that physicians exercised within hospital walls. To begin, medical education moved back into the universities which, according to Magali Larson, paved the way for a professional monopoly of competence.ll She argues that the ap-ch taken to produ- cing scientific knowledge enabled practitioners to produce a commodity that could be standardized and con-trolled tkough comercial rnarket mechanisms. For example, the products of clinicians' labours were too intangible to warrant recognition as a comnodity in the craft or industrial sense. For this reason, &son maintains that \"Xhe ptoduc~ thmdves have Xo be poduced if their products or conanodities are to be given distinctive form. \"12 The only way that producers can be pro- duced is through a particular type of cognitive base. In order to distinguish one type of healing as superior to all others, a group must lay claim to a cognitive base that is both specific and general at the same time: . . .the \"best\" cognitive basis for a momply of competence is one which reveals, or activates, or maximizes the favourable characteristics of a professional market. It must be specific enough to impart distinctiveness to the profes- sional \"commdity\" ; it must be formalized or codified enough to allm standardization of the ''product\" -- which means, ultimately , standar- dization of the producers. And yet it mst not be so clearly codified that it does not allow a principle of exclusim to operate: where every- one can claim to be an expert, there is no expertise. (13) The cognitive base to which Larson refers, is science. Clinicians, who possessed scientific training, were advantaged in two ways. First, they could be identified as starddized 'products', thereby distinguishing themselves from 'irregular' healers. Or, in Larson' s words : What professions obtain from this basic training in pure scierce has no hediaze bearing upon their practice; but the passage through broad scientific training puts the future professionals through one first phase of effective unification and standardization .... No less importantly, basic scientific eaining provides a clear principle of separation froan the exclusion of the \"non-standar- dized\" empirically trained professionals. (14) Tnus, scientific training did not necessarily make university educated doctors mre cornpetant as healers, but it did serve to separate them from 'un-produced producers' or quacks. 15 The second advantage that accrued to university educated clinician was they they automatically became members of privileged scientific groups who mnopolized the production of Wwledge. And, \"in a world where science is the cardinal system of cognitive valiQtion and legitimation,\" clinicians inherited the supreme source of legitimation for their claims to superiority while simultaneously delegitimating irregular healers : 16 In the modern university, which cenealizes the production of knowledge as well as that of pro- ducers, dcienLi&Lc educators con-bol and produce a constantly changing body of knowledge. The cumulative change characteristic of normal science makes the passage of aspiring profes- sionals through the centers for the standardized Thus, production of producers com@ohy, not only be- cause of a legislative fiat but \"naturally\" because these centers mono@lize new knowledge. (17) concludes that scientific education enabled doctors determine medical knowledge and to legitimate their monopoly of know- ledge on the basis of scientific infallibility. 18 Larson's argumnt is strengthened by Thanas Kuhn's assessment of scientific education: \"Until the very last stages in the education of a scientist, textbooks are systematically substituted for the creative scientific literature tht made them possible. l9 he importance of textbooks for standardizing education is that they exclude divergent opinions and evidence that scientific theories or paradigms have failed to explain various phenomena: Scientific education makes use of no equivalent for the art museum or the library of classics, ad the result is a sometimes drastic distortion in the scientist ' s perception of his discipline ' s past. %re than the practitioners of other creative fields, he canes to see it as leading in a straight line to the discipline's present vantage. In short, he comes to see it as progress. (20) Thus, frm Kuhn' s point of view, textbooks contain records of scientific achieve~nts that impart a linear and progressive character to howledge while ignoring problems that have not or cannot be solved through scientific processes of producing knowledge. He maintains that scientific education acquired these features during the early mdern period, when revolutiomry ideas were first published; when new paradigms or ways of seeing the world led to coherent and specialized streams of scientific inquiry. Scientists, who made perceptual transformations in accordance with revolutionary thought experiments, were able to conwibute to specialized journals and texts that were devoted to articulating new paradigms. As for those who could not rake prceptual leaps, they were denied entry into the pursuit of scientific truths. To this effect, Kuhn writes: But there are always some men who cling to one or another of the older views, and they are simply read out of their profession, which there- after ignores their work. The new paradigm implies a new and more rigid definition of the field. Those unwilling or unable to accomdate their work to it must proceed in isolation or attach themselves to same other group. Histmi- cally, they have often simply stayed in the departments of philosophy .... (21) Thus, mnopolies that grew up around journals and textbooks during the early mcdern period, served the interests of nineteenth century clinicians. These new forms of communication, initially having served to challenge traditional authority, were used to entrench the authority of modern physicians. Apart from standardizing medical education, the reformed univer- sities served other important functions in modern doctors' claims to superiority and their push for mnopolistic powers. Krause believes tht university education lent an aura of respectability to scientific medical practice. By virtue of long theoretical training, the establish- ment of a code of ethics, and organized self-policing efforts, university educated practitioners convinced the public that medicire was \"a calling carried out by morally superior individuals. \"22 At the same time, he reasons, the ideology of professional commibnent to public welfare made it difficult for citizens to take issue with professional practices without a sense of guilt. 2 3 Universities also pmved to be useful in terms of reconciling con*a- dictions between professional ideology and the profit motive that was inherent in fee-for-service consulting and atwactive hospital appoint- ments. Elliott notes that tradikonal boundaries that had set learned professionals apart from commerce began to blur when university officials became more involved with lacing their gradustes in leadership roles: Throughout the second half of the nineteenth century the universities gradually became more concerned that their students should find appro- priate places in society. They began to prepare students for the competitive examinations ad to show concern about employment opportunities for graduates in the Church and the professions. By the end of the century an employment agency had been established at Cambridge and dons were even beginning to consider the possibility of students entering on a business career. ( 24 The universities' competitive examination system and concern with career placements were largely responsible for changing attitudes toward work. It became socially acceptable for practitioners to earn a living, so long as they dmnstrated that they had mastered certain skills. Hence, the traditional virtue of cultured gentility carried over, and was fused with the mdern value of competence , via the reformed universities. Medical professionals nurtured the idea that they should be paid in order to work rather than work in order to be paid. By the turn of the twentieth century, the service mtive was more or less engrained in public consciousness. 2 5 EDUCATING THE rnLIC kquiring a distinctive identity through standardized education was one thing, but it did not guarantee that the graduating products could eliminate canpetition altogether. Medicine, like other professions during the formative years, had to create needs that corresponded to specialists' perceptions of service. Or, in Larson's words, \"no munt of coercion could force a clientel to switch allegiances and seek pro- 26 fessional services which it did not even how it needed.\" ?\"nus, scientific doctors had to educate citizens to recognize that they needed pxrticular services before demand could justify large-scale public support for centralized delivery systems. Cartwrikht maintains that public awareness of scientific doctors' superiority was heightened in relation to impmvements in transportation 27 and comunkation. For example, steam power, efficient postal systems, and weekly publications, increased the speed at which people became aware of laboratory inventions and their medical applications. The story of x-rays is a case in point: Xntgen comnicated his discovery to the Wiirzburg fiysico-Medical Society in a paper published in their Proceedings on 28 December 1895. A trans- lation by Arthur Stanton appeared in the British journal Nature on 23 January 1896. ?t.Jo days later, on 25 January, the Lancet carried photographs of a human hand and of a frog made by A. Campbell Swinton in his laboratory at 66 Victoria Street, London. On 22 February t1-e Lancet published a report from Liverpool that an airgun pellet had been localized by means of x-rays and successfully removed. (28) Hence, it was less than two months between the time R6ntgen1s discovery was reported in Germany and its first kmwn use for diagnosis in Britain. The creation of new rnedical needs was also strengthened by com- pulsory education. When the majority of people became literate and learned about achievenents in science and its potential to progressively alleviate hm suffering, public confidence in scientific practitioners was bolstered. Fkiedson writes that, as a result of mass education, \"the public developed knowledge and belief that became more like that of the physician himself ard therefore it became more receptive to his work.\"29 This idea is reinforced by Reiser s selection of early twentieth century mdical anecdotes: Physicians in the 1930s reported that patients often demanded \"an x-ray all over\" to evaluate their diseases, and were ewoumged by a popular press that surrounded the activities of medical science with an atmosphere of omniscieme and omnipotence. Sensational news stories could prompt a patient to dead his doctor use the \"most scientific\" instruments possible , whether or not diagnostically necessary or econmically prudent .... Thus, one day the vice president of a big company came in and said, \"Send me for an elec-brocardiogram; I want to check up on my heart.\" (30) ?bus, it appears that Illich's mtion of Innis' idea that mdern people 'demand the miraculous', were evident in mdern medical practice at an early date; as soon as the public had learned to need the services of scientific doctors. PHYSICIANS CONSOLJDATE ?HEIR INTERESTS Because the production of doctors was a long ad expensive process, and because it took approximately six decades for a heterogeneous public to beccwe a homogeneous and 'properly educated' consuming group, univer- sity educated doctors required some insurance that their interests would be protected. Larson mtes that this insurance came fhmugh state regulatory channels : In a market situation, the guarantee against risks incurred tends to take the form of monopoly, or at least of special protection by public authorities. In this case, the nature of the products and the state of their markets were such that only the state, as the supreme legitimizing and enforcing institution, could sanction the modern ~rofessions' monopolistic claims of superiority for their \"~omdities'~. The attitude of the state toward education and toward monopolies of competence is thus a crucial variable in the development of the professional project. (31) As was discussed with reference to Pasteur's research, the attitude of goverments toward supporting scientific enterprise was mst favourable. Thus, university educated physicians, through their association with science and/or the dominant system or producing and legitimating how- ledge, won monopolies of ccsnpetence from regional governments. While late nineteenth century legislation varied from region to region, scientific practiti.oners, regardless of location, acquired diagnostic and prescriptive powers. This mean that they and ady they could determine the nature of illnesses and appropriate treatments. 32 These powers greatly enhanced doctors' control within and beyond hospital walls, in ways that, according to Larson, took the \"form of arbi-trary exclusive practices against other practitioners. ff33 For example, apothecariese were included in the professional hierarchy while herbalists, who performed similar tasks, were driven underground into urban slm or the countryside. 3 4 Not only did diagnostic and prescriptive powers enable doctors to eliminate canpeting practitioners, it also provided the means whereby they could control the division of labour within a growing medical kier- * By the twentieth century, apothecaries were called pmcists, druggists or chemists. archy. Again, with reference to the apothecaries, physicians elected to incorporate this group into centralized medicine because the apothe- caries guild had proved competency thrcugh written examinations and had won favour with goverment officials. Orce included, however, apothe- caries lost their autonomy as healers and were reduced to an auxiliary role of dispensing drugs to patients who had been diagnosed ard referred with prescription in hand. Hence, the physicians' mmpoly of knowledge enabled them to control the growing number of para-professionals such as nurses and laboratory technologists, as well as channeling patients through the system in a way that assured the maintenance of their central position of power. During the years that scientific practitionms consolidated their autfbority, territorial disputes and public purgings of quacks were comn- place. jb But, by the turn of the twentieth century, doctors were indis- putably the high priests of centralized medical delivery systems in European cities. Krause contends that para-pmfesisonal and lay resis- tance to the doctors' mnoplistic powers was attenuated by the combined force of late nineteenth century legislation and increased complexity in specialized scientific knowledge: \"Domination is perpetuated through the tsm processes of insulation from observability and of political action to combat legislation which would charge the present degree of insulation. \"36 Thus, doctors, thrmgh their affiliation with science, acquired absolute authority to determine what is worth knowing about health and illness and how medical problems are to be solved. Their insulation from public intrusion was established, and is maintained, on the basis of complex and centralized systems of producing lumwledge that exclude non-scientists frm commenting on and critiquing professional actim. To this effect, Johnson writes: In all service-related matters the occupational community is believed to be wiser than the lay- man. From such beliefs the occupational corn- nity derives an ethical sense of full responsi- bility. No graup is more mrally outraged when laymen put forward opinions on occupationally related matters. (37) And, as was suggested in Kuhn's a~lysis of scientific education, doctors me predisposed to see their work in a distorted or infinitely progres- sive light, thus making it difficult for them to assess the limitations of their knawledge. In the event that scientists fail to internalize sanctioned beliefs, they are 'written out' of the profession and/or delegitimized in the eyes of their colleagues and the public. In the case of consulting practitioners, professional self-policing mechanisms usually take the form of withdrawing hospital adnitting privileges, closing informal referral channels, or revoking licences to practice. By the turn of the twentieth century, medicine was monopolized into centralized systems within European cities, but it was not standardized across regional or national boundaries. For the mst part, the doctors' authority was limited to centres where university medical schools were located. But, as mobility increased with impmvements in long distance forms of transportation and c~m~~~lnication, the sptially biased ideas of national and international medicine were realized. The standardization of medicine across regional and national boundaries was not an expessed objective of physicians. In fact, they preferred regional autonomy and fought against pressures to expand. 3 8 But, national health programs began in 1911, when the Gm government introduced National Health ~nsmce, and the fin t international medical organization was established as early as 1907 in Paris. 40 CartWright argues that while physicians opposed to governmental inter- ference, they were obliged to decentralize in location because of needs that arose in relationship to increased mobility: The first contact of one cornunity with another may bring disaster. Plague, syphillis, cblea, and probably virulent smallpox have all reached Western Europe fram exotic sources. Such has been the case since the first ships of the Mediterranean civilization made contact with Africa and the East. An epidemic on a smll slowly-moving sailing vessel tended to die out during the voyage ... but the rapid steamer increased the risk of carrying infection from one lard to another. (41) Thus, apart from transmitting informtion and people, rapid forms of transpartation increased the spread of disease, from region to region, ad country to country. The science of epidemiology, and regional, national and international health organizations grew in response to the need to protect communities against communicable diseases. As a result, drugs, preventive programs, and treatment protocol have been progressively standardized. 42 ~ren though medical education ad practice have retained mny regional and national traits, a patient can receive essentially the same kind of treatment in cities and villages throughout the idustrialized Western mrld, and often in the so-called developing rations. 43 FOOTNOTES TO CHAPTER SIX I Emin Ackerknecht, A Short History of Medicine (New York: Ronald Press, 19681, p. 158.

PART ?HREE: CONCLUSION As the steps toward medicine's modernization were discussed in the preceding chapters, it became increasingly evident that mdernization is synonymus with monopolization. In many respects, doctors assumed their superordinate positions in &ern health care systems in ways that parallel the institutionalization of healing by favoured groups in other empires throughout the history of Western civilization. In short, &ern doctors monopolized resources that enabled them to create and satisfy health related needs. Printed forms of cmunication represent the first and, in my opinion, mst critical resources that nineteenth century European doctors mnopolized. Scientific journals, associated with the Commonwealth of Learning, medical textbooks, and written examinations were indispensable tools that were used by medical reformers to produce official medical knowledge. Through these new forms of communication, reformers developed a complex system of writing that distinguished 'true' knowledge from pseudo-science, religion, and commn knowledge. In this sense, printed journals , texts and examinat ions acquired functions that were analogous to those performed by traditional sacred texts. Whether infornation was written mechanically on paper or by hand on tablets, papyrus, or parchment, modern and traditional fom of written comication served to shape the mlds for medical knowledge while, simultaneously, serving the interests of the knmledge potters. The second cluster of crucial resources that mdern doctors mno- polized came via the hospital revolution. Nineteenth century clinics became, by the turn of the twentieth century, highly controlled environ- ments in which patients participated in diagnostic and prescriptive rituals. By virtue of monopolizing the production of knowledge, doctors also acquired control over its distribution. Prescriptive and diagnostic powers enabled them to oversee medical laboratories, pharmacies, and a growing hierarchy of pa-professional health specialists. Their centralized positions within clinical institutions enabled them to direct both the flow of patients, as well as the use of health technologies. Thus, doctors and hospitals became analogous to traditional priests and medieval cathedrals or ancient temples. The high priests of howledge, be they scientists, diviner or Sshipu-priests, or officials in the Imhotep diety, came to preside over hospital or temple-based rituals associated with divining the sources of illness and prescribing sanc- tioned sources of satisfaction. Given that modern doctors mnopolized medical resources in ways that parallel the institutiomlization of healing in traditional empires, it is reasonable to expect that the nature of their authority would be analogous to that of traditional healers. And, to a certain extent, this is true. For example, both traditional and mderm doctors derived their authority on the basis of dmns*ated and imputed competence. The dmnstrated component of authority rests on subjective evaluations and pragmatic actualization of superior medical knowledge. It is similar to the concrete nature of the Shaman's authority in pre-literate societies. Imputed autbrity, on the othw hand, was conferred to institutional healers on the basis of objective howledge -- information that was divorced writing systems. 1 153 from subjective experience by virtue of complex In terms of demonstrated authority, -traditional healers employed dietetic and herbal therapies, quarantine measures, surgery, philoso- phical counsel, and other treatments that were proven to be effective in a pre-literate or pragmatic sense. Similarly, mdern surgeons demon- strated superior skills when they began to apply Harvey's and Vesaluis' discoveries, while nineteenth century clinicians proved to be vastly superior to other physicians, after laboratory scientists isolated causes and cures for numerous diseases. The fact that traditional healers saw diseases to be symptoms of divine wrath while modern clini- cians regarded diseases in light of microscopic organisms, is neither here nor there. In terms of demonstrated authority, the ultimate criterion for legitimation rested with subjective appraisals of thera- 2 peutic effectiveness. Therefore, despite different theoretical orien- tations, traditional and modern healers demonstrated their competence in similar ways. Traditional and modem practitioners also possessed knowledge that could not be demonstrated in a pragrratic fashion. Therefore, a conrponent of their authority was derived from imputed wisdom. By virtus of monopolizing the production of written knowledge, favoured groups of healers acquired state or religious sanctions to contml the distribution of medical resources. Imputed knowledge and power was based on signs of symbols that made sense within exclusive domains of literate healers and/ or individuals wb had been elected as scientists. It did not neces- sarily make sense in subjective terms. I-t was this imputed component of authority that created possibili- ties for, in Illichts mrds, rmnipulation, and, in Innist terms, the rigidification of power. For example, Egyptian priests were absolved from responsibility when their treatments resulted in further impairment or death to a patient. This was the case so long as they had followed, faithfully, written codes of knowledge. This sw principle applied to modern medical practice. The Men of proof in scientific medicine rests with the rules that govern the production of scientific knowledge. Written codes of knowledge became both the basis of treatment protocol as well as its legitimation. Thus, the written or imputed dimension of official medical authority has posed a persistent regulatory dilemma in both traditional and modern medical systems. Thus far, finding analogies between the nature of traditional healens' authority ad that of modern practitioners, has been a relatively simple task. Now, however, I have reached a pint where parallels between traditional and modern medicine begin to diverge. This tangen- tial point arises in further consideration of the imputed component of medical autbrity. Therefore, I shall embark on a new course, where I endeavour to show that the problenatic nature of imputed authority is magnified in modern medicine because of the bias of printed communication. A significant feature of traditional monopolies of knowledge in medicine is that, while official healers dominated medicine, their powers did not cancel the possibility that alternative ways of generating and satisfying health related needs could continue to thrive at some level of culture. For example, Babylonian, Egyptian, and Christian priesthoods were remgnized as supreme sources of medical knowledge. On the basis of complex systems of writing, these groups generated belief systems that determined the way that health and illness was thought about and dealt with. But, at the same time, as8 practitioners, surgeons, barbers, herbalists, rootcutters, and other types of unofficial healers, not to mention a high degree of self and mutual care, represen- ted alternative forms of medical knowledge. In other words, competition was endemic to traditional systems of authority. Modern medical systems, on the other hand, are part of industrial empires that were born and grew as a result of scientific progress. In this way, science and the notion of progress, became the dominant belief system in modam Western nations. By way of clarifying what is meant by the term 'dominant belief system' , it is useful to irdude Morgen- thu's description of the function that science serves in industrialized cultures : . . . science, by searching for and transmitting certain kinds of knowledge, conveys inevitably certain valuations about the meaning of the reality with which it is concerned. By dis- tinguishing not only truth frm errar but also the truth worth knowing fm the one that is not, science provides man with cwtain stan- dards of orientation that guide him in his journey through the otherwise bewildering variety of experiences. Thus thugh the distinctions it must make, science conveys not only objective knowledge but also the image of a meaningful world worth knowing, selected from amng the many available ones. (3) A key idea, expressed in this passage, is that science is 'selected' out of many ways of defining and solving problems. Similarly, tradi- tional belief systems were 'selected' from a host of other pssibilities. Hwever, these selection processes, in terms of the mnopoly concept, were not necessarily conscious choices. Rather, dominant belief systems were shpaed by the biases of comnunications media and the groups who controlled them. It is this very pint that distinguishes lTlodern medicine from traditional healing programs. Scientific medicine was 'selected' through the bias of printing processes that lent a standardized charac- ter to howledge: This was no$ a possibility in -h?aditional empires. As was discussed in Chapter Six, the selection of science, as a &el for medical pactice, simultaneously eliminated competition: \"A tendency to mompoly by mo on of competing 'products' was inherent in the process of standardization.\"' Because of this factor, competing or balancing ways of howing &cut health and disease, are less likely to arise in industrialized cultures. In conclusion, modern monopolies are more rigid and mre firmly entrenched than camparable monopolies in traditional empires. Scientific doctors exercise a radical monopoly over healing in industrial societies because the bias of printed communication enables them to standardize the production and satisfaction of health care needs in a way that is unprecedented in the history of Western medicine. Because of this bias, the demonstrated component of their authority ceases to function as a check against manipulation, which is inherent to the imputed dimension of professional power. In other words, when professional service is experienced as a failure in a subjective sense, there are m convivial channels through which consumws can generate different needs and sources of satisfaction.b Short of seeking alternative sources of health care on the margins of industrialized cultmes, patients are left with the choices of suhitting to official medical care or being abandoned altogether. FOOTNOTES TO PAFa' m: CONCUTSION Dennis Wrong defines competent authority as \"a power relation in hich the subject obeys the directives of the authority out of belief in the authority's superior competence to decide which actions will best serve the subject's interests and goals.\" Refer to Dennis Wrong, Sceptical Sociology (New York: Columbia University, 19761, p. 197. Friedson accepts this definition but stresses the pint that a physician's competence is largely divorced fram subjective evidence. Professional authority is \"hpu;ted rather than demnstrated.\" Refer to Eliot Friedson, \"The Impurity of Professional Authority\".

CONCLUSION TO THE THESIS: ASSESSING ?HE UTILITY OF THE MONOPOLY CONCEPT For the mst part, this thesis owes its structure to Innis' approach to the problem of knmledge and authority in Western civilization. Relationships that he discovered between communication, knowledge and monopoly led me to examine the role that ccsrrrmrnications media played in traditional medical systems. Prior to broaching the subject with a cmunications perspective, I assumed that all traditional healing programs were the same, and that the healing arts were, somehow, untainted by problematic power dynamics that are featured in modern medicine. But, when I assembled selected snips of medical history and sociology under headings that matched Innis' historical epochs, I began to perceive that traditional healing programs were unique, and that each one was characterized by systems of authority that stemmed from the biases of comunication. In addition to lending a cohesive structure to a diverse selection of historical and sociological literature, Innis' ideas were useful in terms of revealing another dimension of understanding to the problem of authority in traditional medicine. Privileged groups, who controlled the instruments of ca~nnunication, acquired the authority to detkne how medical problems could be defined and solved. Mhermore, on the basis of written or imputed information, they derived legal and ideolo- gical pers to persuade others that their laowledge was superior, even when they failed to dmnstrate cmpetence in a subjective sense. Given this understanding of the nature of traditional authority, I was encouraged to examine the growth of &ern medicine in view of forms of cammunication that developed in relationship to early printing ventures. Here again, it was possible to trace the imputed component of professional authority to the written word. I found that, through their key positions in early modern printing ventures, reformers came to determine the characte of 'true' medical howledge. The bias of print technology, which governed the production of learned journals, textbooks, and written examinations shaped the contours of howledge, well in advance of nineteenth century demonstrations of the superiority of scientific medical practice. Innis' ideas regarding the bias of cammunication also suggested why and how potentially convivial medical reforms were converted into manipulatory social arrangements. As was discussed in Chapter M, Illich maintains that early applications of science to solving public health problems, were convivial. That is to say, preventive measures, such as water purification and innoculation programs, did not require strict professional control to be successful. By the same token, the popular press conveyed information in a fashion that made scientific discoveries intelligible to everyone. But, by the turn of the twentieth century, scientific knowledge and medical practice were institutionalized and sealed from public scrutiny. This transformation appears to have stemmed from the bias of printed communication. First, in response to papal censorship, members of learned societies developed a cmplex written language that concealed revolutionary ideas from the uninitiated. Second, the mechanical bias of printing lent a standardized character to scientific knowledge that enabled doctors to educate themselves in a way that eliminated competing practitioners. And third, the progressive nature of scientific know- ledge captured the kginations of government officials, entrepreneurs, and the public. Modern doctors, in effect, capitalized on their affilia- tion with science, which became the leading poductive force in &ern Western nations. Thus, print technology, and related psychological, social, political, and economic developments, can be seen to have trans- posed potentially liberating medical reforms into rigid systems of power. While Innis' ideas pointed to possible sources of medical authority, Illich's writings were useful in terms of showing how this authority was maintained and extended by the modern medical profession. His concept of radical momply led me to examine the imputed component of doctors' authority in light of reformed universities and hospitals. The socio- logical literam was rich with material to support Illich's premise that, when clinical care became an extension of university laboratories, science became the master of modern medicine while alternative approaches to healing were delegitimated. The modernization of univ~sities and hospitals, into highly centralized institutions for the production and disiribution of standardized knowledge, explains why the generation and satisfaction of medical needs is subject to radical professional domina- tion. Thus, I concluded that, even while the nature of traditional and modern medical authority is analogous, modern doctors monopolized healing in a way that was unprecedented in medical history. While I found Illich's ideas helped me to adapt Innis' comnunica- tions perspective to an examination of modern medical authority, I suspect that I would have arrived at the same conclusion in the absence of Illichts radical monopoly concept. In fact, if I were to undertake I this same study again, I would include Illich as a minor source only, and I would develop Innis' knowledge mmpoly concept mre fully. In particular, I would include mre of Elizabeth Eisenstein's research which is, in my opinion, an invaluable complement to Innis' ideas regarding the bias of ~rinted cmunication. However, in all fairness to Illich, his radical mnopoly concept would have been infinitely more useful if I had continued to discuss modern medicine with respect to twentieth century developnents in air travel and electronic.and satellite communications. For example, if one accepts the premise that monopolies in modern medicine were founded on the bias of printed communication, it would be interesting to know if more recent forms of communication have served to extend, OP to check professional domination. Illich, I believe, would argue that, while centralized delivery systems have decentralized in location during the twentieth century, the fundamental nature of professional authority rdns secure. Clearly, this is an area for further research. hther area for future consideration came to mind while examining classical Greek medicine. It seems to me that medical reformers, who are currently designing and implementing alternative medical programs, would benefit by an in-depth analysis of the structure of classical medicine. In my opinion, alternative medicine in industrial societies, is alternative in name only. Because of rigid alignments between universities, clinics, private enterprise, and government funding and regulatmy bodies, competing programs2 are absorbed into the dominant system, thereby losing autonomy and the conditions that are required for them to flourish as 'truly' alternative sources of satisfaction. \" Such as holistic medicine, women's health collectives, 'barefoot doctor' clinics, lay counselling services, and the like. Finally, the mompoly concept, as drawn from the writings of Harold Innis and Ivan Illich, was a useful guide to understanding the nature of authority in modern medicine. By leading me to examine the birth of modern medicine, in light of developents in cmunication, it pointed to a plausible source of doctors' authority, as well as how-the& powers were maintained and extended. These firdings added anothevl dimension of understanding to material from medical histories and sociological analyses of professional authority. The monopoly concept also enabled me to step outside of a morass of details, concerning medical practice, and to examine the ~ture of professional authority from further afield. It helped me to sidestep a current and fashionable tendency to blame 'self-seeking doctors' and/ or 'gullible patients' for problematic power dynamics that exist in medical practice. Instead, the concept suggests tht bofh the producers and consumers of mdern medicine are confined by the way that knowledge ms mnopolized during the nineteenth century. BIBLIOGRAPHY Ackerknecht, -in.
