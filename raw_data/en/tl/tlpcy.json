If your child comes to UCSF for primary care, you can schedule a vaccine or booster appointment by contacting your child's primary care provider. - Children ages 6 months and up should get the COVID-19 vaccine. - Children ages 5 and up should get an [updated (bivalent) booster](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-bivalent-vaccine-boosters)at least two months after their most recent shot, whether that was the second dose of a primary series or a monovalent booster. - Children ages 6 months to 4 years can get an updated shot depending on the primary vaccine series they received. (See guidelines below.) - Children who are immunocompromised should follow the guidelines recommended for them. (See below.) COVID-19 vaccines remain the best public health measure for protecting people from the virus, slowing transmission and reducing the likelihood of new variants emerging. Full vaccination requires two or three doses administered at separate appointments, depending on your child's age and the vaccine you choose. (See below for more information.) When your child gets the first dose, we'll schedule the next appointment. UCSF offers Pfizer vaccination (primary series) for patients age 6 months and older and Moderna vaccination (primary series) for patients 6 months to 5 years old. We offer Pfizer and Moderna booster shots for patients ages 6 months and older. Where to get the COVID-19 vaccine Children who come to UCSF for primary care and are at least 6 months old can receive a COVID-19 vaccine at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospitals. To schedule an appointment, please contact your child's primary care provider. Please keep these rules in mind: - Patients 6 months to 17 years must be accompanied by a parent or other adult caregiver. - Each patient and their parent or other caregiver will be screened for COVID-19 symptoms. If either one has symptoms, the appointment must be rescheduled. COVID-19 vaccines are also available through many neighborhood pharmacies, including CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid. If your child isn't a UCSF patient, we recommend scheduling an appointment at a local pharmacy, visiting California's [My Turn](https://myturn.ca.gov/) website or contacting your child's primary care provider. Vaccine and booster guidelines Federal health officials recommend booster shots - which help to maximize and extend the protection that the vaccine provides - for all patients.
