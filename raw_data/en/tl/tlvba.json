That you could integrate ancient insights for self-mastery into your daily life without needing a four-hour meditation routine? That's exactly what we're here for. Sign up for our newsletter and every week, you'll receive: 1 Wisdom quote straight from an age-old sacred text 2 Nuggets of inspiration from Ananta, to make that wisdom relatable 3 Introspective questions to awaken your inner guru, no matter how packed your schedule is A WARM WELCOME FROM OUR CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, ANANTA RIPA AJMERA Welcome to The Ancient Way, your bridge between eternal wisdom and contemporary life. We're here to help you tap into the radiant power of your authentic Self. Our logo is inspired by the Sun, the universal source of light, encircled by the earthen lamps, or 'diyas', that are central to the 'garba' dance. This circular folk dance, celebrated by all genders, honors the divine feminine power embodied by the warrior goddess Durga. In my book, [The Way of the Goddess: Daily Rituals to Awaken Your Inner Warrior and Discover Your True Self](/wayofthegoddess) (Penguin Random House TarcherPerigee 2022), I delve into the profound journey of Durga as she vanquishes demons. These demons symbolize our inner obstacles that hold us back, disconnecting us from ourselves and others. Just like Durga, we all have the power to embrace our true selves and achieve self-mastery. The lamp's light signifies the divine feminine energy within us all, ready to illuminate our true Self, connecting us in the eternal, circular dance of life. To ignite the fire of your self-mastery and awaken your inner guru so you can make profound life changes that bring your inner peace and the power to leave the world better than you found it. OUR MISSION About Me I'm Ananta, a spiritual teacher, author, Ayurveda practitioner, yoga instructor, and Co-founder and Director of The Ancient Way.
