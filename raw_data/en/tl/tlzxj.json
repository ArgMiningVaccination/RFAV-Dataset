Despite being deployed for Covid-19 duty, around 200 staff members of the college including doctors, nurses, interns, PhD scholars and class IV employees were not included in the list of healthcare workers to be vaccinated in phase 1. This was because of the failure on the part of the college administration to provide data in required format to the district health authorities. TOI had highlighted earlier how the employees of the college could not be enlisted for vaccination. Joint director, homeopathy, Dr Manoj Yadav said, \"As soon as the matter came to my knowledge on Sunday, I gave directions to the principal to share the details at the earliest so that workers can get shots.\" Dr Yadav also said he was investigating the reasons behind the delay and would seek an explanation from the college administration. College principal Dr Arvind Verma confirmed that he has got the directions from the director. \"The list of employees is being prepared. We are in touch with health officers and would provide them details soon,\" he said. He added that the health department has details of employees as they were shared in March-April for deployment in Covid duty. They could have used this data for vaccination as well, he said. However, district immunization officer Dr MK Singh said, \"We needed data in a specific format and for that purpose, all heads of institutes and hospitals were informed in writing in November\". In fact, he said, college officials had been reminded several times since November. \"However, college officials said they had not received any instruction from their seniors to provide details,\" Dr Singh added. According to Dr Singh, the college contacted the health department on Sunday. It has now been asked to submit details at the earliest so that their employees can be included in the mop-up round. When TOI asked the joint director why the college was not directed earlier to submit details, Dr Yadav said there was no need for directions from the top because all state homeopathic colleges were free to take decisions on their own. In fact, he added, barring Lucknow, all other homeopathic colleges had submitted details well in time. "}
