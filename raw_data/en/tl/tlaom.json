The Health Department is closely monitoring the status of vaccinations in NYC, including the demographics and locations of people who have received the vaccine. The data below show how vaccinations in NYC have progressed since December 2020. Data on this page come from the [ Citywide Immunization Registry (CIR)](/site/doh/providers/reporting-and-services/citywide-immunization-registry-cir.page). Jump to: Percent of NYC residents vaccinated This table shows how many NYC residents have been vaccinated citywide and by borough, and how many doses have been administered in NYC. Data on doses administered shows the total and daily number of COVID-19 vaccine administered in NYC. This includes doses given in the city to non-NYC residents. Data on people vaccinated shows the trends in people who received at least one dose, completed the primary vaccine series, and who also received monovalent additional/booster dose(s), and received a bivalent dose organized by borough, age, race/ethnicity and sex. These data show the percent of NYC residents who received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine and the percent who completed the primary series, by Modified ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (MODZCTAs). MODZCTAs can provide better estimates of population size than ZIP codes because they combine census blocks that have smaller populations. This table shows data on the percent of NYC residents vaccinated by age, race/ethnicity and sex. These data show the percent of NYC residents who received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine and the percent who completed the primary series, by borough of residence and demographic group. The percentages reflect the number of people vaccinated within that specific demographic group.
