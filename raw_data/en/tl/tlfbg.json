[7500] CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 11 Section II Program's Performance Measurement and Progress This section consists of two subsections that gather information about the CHIP and/or Medicaid program. Section IIA captures your e nrollment progress as well as changes in the number and/or rate of uninsured children in your state. Section IIB captures progress towards meeting your state's general strategic objectives and performance goals. Section IIA: Enrollment And Uninsured Data 1. The information in the table below is the Unduplicated Number of Children Ever Enrolled in CHIP in your state for the two most recent reporting periods. The enrollment numbers reported below should correspond to line 7 (Unduplicated Number Ever Enrolled Year) in your state's 4th quarter data report (submitted in October) in the CHIP Statistical Enrollment Data System (SEDS). The percent change column reflects the percent change in enrollment over the two -year period. If the percent change exceeds 10 percent (increase or decrease), please explain in letter A below any factors that may account for these changes (such as decreases due to elimination of outreach or increases due to program expansions). This information will be filled in autom atically by CARTS through a link to SEDS. Please wait until you have an enrollment number from SEDS before you complete this response. If the information displayed in the table below is inaccurate, please make any needed updates to the data in SEDS and th en refresh this page in CARTS to reflect the updated data.

Please explain any factors that may account for enrollment increases or decreases exceeding 10 percent. [7500] 2. The tables below show trends in the number and rate of uninsured children in your state. Three year averages in Table 1 are based on the Current Population Survey. The single year estimates in Table 2 are based on the American Community Survey (ACS). CARTS will fill in the single year estimates automatically, and significant changes are denoted with an asterisk (*).If your state uses an alternate data source and/or methodology for measuring change in the number and/or rate of uninsured children, please explain in Question #3.

Please explain any activities or factors that may account for increases or decreases in your number and/or rate of uninsured children. [7500] In FFY18 Massachusetts saw a small increase in the uninsurance rate, perhaps because of uncertainty about whether the ACA would be repealed and whether CHIP would be reauthorized. Although the above table shows the insurance rate is generally holding steady for a subset of children in Massachusetts for the past few years, FFY19 saw more children gain health insurance coverage and Massachusetts is largely reported as having the highest rate of coverage in the nation as discussed in Goal 1 in Section IIB. CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 13 B. Please note any comments here concerning ACS data limitations that may affect the reliability or precision of these estimates. [7500] 3. Please indicate by checking the box below whether your state has an alternate data source and/or methodology for measuri ng the change in the number and/or rate of uninsured children. Yes (please report your data in the table below) No (skip to Question #4) Please report your alternate data in the table below. Data are required for two or more points in time to demonst rate change (or lack of change). Please be as specific and detailed as possible about the method used to measure progress toward covering the uninsured. Topic Description Data source(s) Reporting period (2 or more points in time) Methodology Population (Please include ages and income levels) Sample sizes Number and/or rate for two or more points in time Statistical significance of results A.

What are the limitatio ns of the data or estimation methodology? [7500] D. How does your state use this alternate data source in CHIP program planning? [7500] CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 14 Enter any Narrative text related to Section IIA below. [7500] CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 15 Section IIB: State Strategic Objectives And Performance Goals This subsection gathers information on your state's general strategic objectives, performance goals, performance measures and progress towards meeting goals, as specified in your CHIP state plan. (If your goals reported in the annual report now differ from Section 9 of your CHIP state plan, please indicate how they differ in \"Other Comments on Measure.\" Also, the state plan should be amended to reconcile these differences). The format of this section provides your state wit h an opportunity to track progress over time. This section contains templates for reporting performance measurement data for each of five categories of strategic objectives, related to: Reducing the number of uninsured children CHIP enrollment Medicaid en rollment Increasing access to care Use of preventative care (immunizations, well child care) Please report performance measurement data for the three most recent years for which data are available (to the extent that data are available). In the first two columns, data from the previous two years' annual reports (FFY 2017 and FFY 201 8) will be populated with data from previously reported data in CARTS. If you reported data in the two previous years' reports and you want to update/change the data, please enter that data. If you reported no data for either of those two years, but you now have data available for them, please enter the data. In the third column, please report the most recent data available at the time you are submitting the current a nnual report (FFY 2019 ). In this section, the term performance measure is used to refer to any data your state provides as evidence towards a particular goal within a strategic objective. For the purpose of this section, \"objectives\" refer to the five bro ad categories listed above, while \"goals\" are state -specific, and should be listed in the appropriate subsections within the space provided for each objective. NOTES: Please do not reference attachments in this section. If details about a particular measu re are located in an attachment, please summarize the relevant information from the attachment in the space provided for each measure. In addition, please do not report the same data that were reported for Child Core Set reporting. The intent of this secti on is to capture goals and measures that your state did not report elsewhere. As a reminder, Child Core Set reporting migrated to MACPRO in December 2015. Historical data are still available for viewing in CARTS. Additional instructions for completing each row of the table are provided below. A. Goal: For each objective, space has been provided to report up to three goals. Use this section to provide a brief description of each goal you are reporting within a given strategic objective. All new goals should include a direction and a target. For clarification only, an example goal would be : \"Increase (direction) by 5 percent (target) the number of CHIP beneficiaries who turned 13 years old during the measurement year who had a second dose of MMR, three hepati tis B vaccinations and one varicella vaccination by their 13th birthday.\" B. Type of Goal: For each goal you are reporting within a given strategic objective, please indicate the type of goal, as follows: CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 16 New/revised : Check this box if you have revised or add ed a goal. Please explain how and why the goal was revised. Continuing : Check this box if the goal you are reporting is the same one you have reported in previous annual reports. Discontinued : Check this box if you have met your goal and/or are discontinu ing a goal. Please explain why the goal was discontinued. C. Status of Data Reported: Please indicate the status of the data you are reporting for each goal, as follows: Provisional: Check this box if you are reporting performance measure data for a goal, but the data are currently being modified, verified, or may change in any other way befor e you finalize them for FFY 2019 . Explanation of Provisional Data - When the value of the Status of Data Reported field is selected as \"Provisional\", the state m ust specify why the data are provisional and when the state expects the data will be final. Final: Check this box if the data you are reporting a re considered final for FFY 2019 . Same data as reported in a previous year's annual report: Check this box if t he data you are reporting are the same data that your state reported for the goal in another annual report. Indicate in which year's annual report you previously reported the data. D. Measurement Specification: This section is included for only two of the ob jectives \u2014 objectives related to increasing access to care, and objectives related to use of preventative care \u2014because these are the two objectives for which states may report using the HEDIS\u00ae measurement specification. In this section, for each goal, plea se indicate the measurement specification used to calculate your performance measure data (i.e., were the measures calculated using the HEDIS\u00ae specifications or some other method unrelated to HEDIS\u00ae). Please indicate whether the measure is based on HEDIS\u00ae technical specifications or another source. If HEDIS\u00ae is selected, the HEDIS\u00ae Version field must be completed. If \"Other\" measurement specification is selected, the explanation field must be completed. HEDIS\u00ae Version: Please specify HEDIS\u00ae Version (examp le 2016). This field must be completed only when a user selects the HEDIS\u00ae measurement specification. \"Other\" measurement specification explanation: If \"Other\", measurement specification is selected, please complete the explanation of the \"Other\" measureme nt specification. The explanation field must be completed when \"Other\" measurement specification has been selected. E. Data Source: For each performance measure, please indicate the source of data. The categories provided in this section vary by objective. For the objectives related to reducing the number of uninsured children and CHIP or Medicaid enrollment, please indicate whether you have used eligibility/enrollment data, survey data (specify the survey used), or other source (specify the other source). For the objectives related to access to care and use of preventative care, please indicate whether you used administrative data (claims) (specify the kind of administrative data used), hybrid data (claims and medical records) (specify how the two were use d to create the data source), survey data (specify the survey used), or other source (specify the other source). In all cases, if another data source was used, please explain the source. CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 17 F. Definition of Population Included in Measure: Numerator: Please indi cate the definition of the population included in the numerator for each measure (such as the number of visits required for inclusion, e.g., one or more visits in the past year). Denominator: Please indicate the definition of the population included in th e denominator for each measure. For measures related to increasing access to care and use of preventative care, please Check one box to indicate whether the data are for the CHIP population only, or include both CHIP and Medicaid (Title XIX) children comb ined. If the denominator reported is not fully representative of the population defined above (the CHIP population only, or the CHIP and Medicaid (Title XIX) populations combined), please further define the denominator. For example, denominator includes on ly children enrolled in managed care in certain counties, technological limitations preventing reporting on the full population defined, etc.). Please report information on exclusions in the definition of the denominator (including the proportion of childr en excluded), The provision of this information is important and will provide CMS with a context so that comparability of denominators across the states and over time can occur. G. Deviations from Measure Specification For the measures related to increasing a ccess to care and use of preventative care. If the data provided for a measure deviates from the measure specification, please select the type(s) of measure specification deviation. The types of deviation parallel the measure specification categories for each measure. Each type of deviation is accompanied by a comment field that states must use to explain in greater detail or further specify the deviation when a deviation(s) from a measure is selected. The five types (and examples) of deviat ions are: Year of Data (e.g., partial year), Data Source (e.g., use of different data sources among health plans or delivery systems), Numerator (e.g., coding issues), Denominator (e.g., exclusion of MCOs, different age groups, definition of continuous enrollment), Other. When one or more of the types are selected, states are required to provide an explanation. Please report the year of data for each performance measure. The year (or months) should correspond to the period in which enrollment or utilizati on took place. Do not report the year in which data were collected for the measure, or the version of HEDIS\u00ae used to calculate the measure, both of which may be different from the period corresponding to enrollment or utilization of services. H. Date Range: available for 201 9 CARTS reporting period. Please define the date range for the reporting period based on the \"From\" time period as the month and year which corresponds to the beginning period in which utilization took place and please report the \"To\" time period as the month and year which corresponds to the end period in which utilization took place. Do not report the year in which data were collected for the measure, or the version of HEDIS\u00ae used to calculate the measure, both of which may be different from the period corresponding to utilization of services. I. Performance Measurement Data (HEDIS\u00ae or Other): In this section, please report the numerators and denominators, rates for each measure (or component). The template provides two sections for enterin g the performance measurement data, depending on CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 18 whether you are reporting using HEDIS\u00ae or other methodologies. The form fields have been set up to facilitate entering numerators and denominators for each measure. If the form fields do not give you enoug h space to fully report on the measure, please use the \"additional notes\" section. The preferred method is to calculate a \"weighted rate\" by summing the numerators and denominators across plans, and then deriving a single state -level rate based on the rati o of the numerator to the denominator). The reporting unit for each measure is the state as a whole. If states calculate rates for multiple reporting units (e.g., individual health plans, different health care delivery systems), states must aggregate dat a from all these sources into one state rate before reporting the data to CMS. In the situation where a state combines data across multiple reporting units, all or some of which use the hybrid method to calculate the rates, the state should enter zeroes i n the \"Numerator\" and \"Denominator\" fields. In these cases, it should report the state -level rate in the \"Rate\" field and, when possible, include individual reporting unit numerators, denominators, and rates in the field labeled \"Additional Notes on Meas ure,\" along with a description of the method used to derive the state -level rate. J. Explanation of Progress: The intent of this section is to allow your state to highlight progress and describe any quality -improvement activities that may have contributed to your progress. Any quality -improvement activity described should involve the CHIP program, benefit CHIP enrollees, and relate to the performance measure and your progress. An example of a quality -improvement activity is a state -wide initiative to inform individual families directly of their children's immunization status with the goal of increasing immunization rates. CHIP would either be the primary lead or substantially involved in the project. If improvement has not occurred over time, this section ca n be used to discuss potential reasons for why progress was not seen and to describe future quality -improvement plans. In this section, your state is also asked to set annual performance objectives for FFY 20 20, 202 1 and 202 2. Based on your recent perfor mance on the measure (from FFY 2017 through 201 9), use a combination of expert opinion and \"best guesses\" to set objectives for the next three years. Please explain your rationale for setting these objectives. For example, if your rate has been increasin g by 3 or 4 percentage points per year, you might project future increases at a similar rate. On the other hand, if your rate has been stable over time, you might set a target that projects a small increase over time. If the rate has been fluctuating ove r time, you might look more closely at the data to ensure that the fluctuations are not an artifact of the data or the methods used to construct a rate. You might set an initial target that is an average of the recent rates, with slight increases in subse quent years. In future annual reports, you will be asked to comment on how your actual performance compares to the objective your state set for the year, as well as any quality -improvement activities that have helped or could help your state meet future ob jectives. K. Other Comments on Measure: Please use this section to provide any other comments on the measure, such as data limitations, plans to report on a measure in the future, or differences between performance measures reported here and those discussed i n Section 9 of the CHIP state plan.

We were unable to report on this measure last year due to data issues. In looking at the rate for FFY15, it appears we used the number of all children (both Medicaid and CHIP) on premium assistance for the numerator and just CHIP enrolled children for the denominator resulting in an artificially high rate of 15%. Since CHIP children by definition must be uninsured upon enrollment and since the only CHIP children in premium assistance are those for whom we found access to insurance during an investigation, it is not surprising that the rate of CHIP children in premium assistance is low. Therefore we will revise this goal for next year. Explanation of P rogress: How did your performance in 2018 compare with the Annual Performance O bjective documented in your 2017 Annual Report? We changed the goal to reflect the more accurate picture of CHIP member enrollment in premium assistance. In years prior to FFY1 6, it appears the premium assistance CHIP enrollment number was overstated to include both Medicaid and CHIP members. Since CHIP children by definition must be uninsured upon enrollment and since the only CHIP children in premium assistance are those for whom we found access to insurance during an investigation, it is not surprising that the rate of CHIP children in premium assistance is low. We set this year's goal to be slightly higher than the result from FFY17 and met this new goal. Explanation of Pr ogress: How did your performance in 201 9 compare with the Annual Performance O bjective documented in your 2018 Annual Report? The performance in 2019 was better than in 2018 as the percentage of CHIP children enrolled in Premium Assistance increased from 2.5% to 3.3%.

What quality improvement activities that involve the CHIP program and benefit CHIP enrollees help enhance your ability to report on this measure, improve your results for this measure, or make progress toward your goal? MassHealth convened an internal Pediatric QI workgroup to identify and implement activities to support improved performance on all measures for which performance goals were set in the FFY 2015 and 2016 CHIP report. In the past year, the group has worked to draft two materials designed to support pregnant members to access prenatal care early, and supporting providers in helping make connections for their members with communi ty-based resources related to pregnancy and MCH care. We expect these materials to be finalized and disseminated in the upcoming year. Though the group was working to support improvement on the Frequency of Perinatal Care measure, we are aware that NCQA will not include this measure in HEDIS 2018. As the materials in development are designed to support both early and frequent access to prenatal care, they are likely to also be impactful for the Timeliness of Prenatal Care measure that is replacing the frequency of prenatal care goal in this CHIP report. What quality improvement activities that involve the CHIP program and benefit CHIP enrollees help enhance your ability to report on this measure, improve your results for this measure, or make progress t oward your goal? MassHealth has convened an Internal Pediatric Q1 workgroup to identify and implement activities to support improved performance on all measures for which performance goals were set in the FFY 2015, 2016, and 2017 CHIP report. In the past y ear, the group completed work on two materials designed to support pregnant members to access prenatal care early, and supporting providers in helping make connections for their members with community -based resources related to pregnancy and MCH care, and these materials are now posted on the MassHealth website. In addition to the quality improvement activities listed above, the Prenatal and Postpartum Care HEDIS measure (PPC) is part of the ACO, MCO, and PCC Plan 2019 performance measure slates (measureme nt period -CY 2018). For the ACO program, the PPC measure is one of several measures that factor into an overall ACO DSRIP accountability scores which are used to determine ACO payments. What quality improvement activities that involve the CHIP program a nd benefit CHIP enrollees help enhance your ability to report on this measure, improve your results for this measure, or make progress toward your goal? MassHealth serves on an advisory committee for the MA Perinatal Neonatal Quality Improvement Network wi th summits held twice a year discussing diverse maternal health topics for QI across the state. Through a Pediatric and Perinatal QIP, a toolkit for practices and providers was developed incorporating CAC, midwife, and EIPP feedback. Materials have been de signed to support pregnant members' access to prenatal care early and to support providers in helping make connections for their members with community -based resources related to pregnancy and MCH care. In addition to the QI activities listed above, the PP C measure is part of the ACO, MCO, and PCC Plan 2019 performance measure slates, measurement period - CY 2018. Past performance has been based on plan HEDIS rates. 2019 (CY2018) performance was the first year of data collection from the ACO program.

CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 65 1. What other strategies does your state use to measure and report on access to, quality, or outcomes of care received by your CHIP population? What have you found? [7500] MassHealth collects and reports on select HEDIS measures through its performance and monitoring measure slates for its ACO, MCO, and PCC Plan enrolled populations. Many of these reported measures are also part of the Child Core Set and are reported annually to CMS through the MACPro system. Additionally, MassHealth continues to calculate several non -HEDIS, Child Core measures relevant to the CHIP population: Using administrative claims and encounter data sets, MassHealth caculates rates for the D evelopmental Screening in the First Three Years of Life (DEV -CH) and Dental sealants (SEAL -CH) measures. MassHealth also continues to work with the MA Department of Public Health to utilize the MassCHIP system as a data source to calculate the Live Bir ths Weighing less than 2,500 grams (LBW -CH). MassHealth has been calculating these non -HEDIS, Child Core measures since it's participation in the CHIPRA Quality Demonstration Grant. MassHealth uses the HEDIS and Child Core Set data as part of the overall quality management strategy. Specifically the measures are used to: Assess ACO/MCO quality performance and for ACOs determine payments based on that performance; Assess ACO and MCO contract compliance; and Identify ACO, MCO, and PCC Plan quali ty improvement focus areas. Supporting improved performance on selected measures from the Child Core Set is the focus of work being undertaken by MassHealth to pursue and meet performance improvement goals that are included elsewhere in this annual CHIP r eport. By using the Child Core Set in these multiple ways, MassHealth is able to monitor, track, and support improvement of care received by the CHIP population Other activity: MassHealth serves on advisory committee for MA Perinatal Neonatal Quality Improvement Network and served on a taskforce working on toolkit for moms with OUD. MassHealth is on the MA maternal morbidity and mortality review committee of all maternal deaths in the state during pregnancy or within 1 year after birth. The workgroup has yielded a lot of important data briefs including maternal mental health and maternal death. 2. What strategies does your CHIP program have for future measurement and reporting on access to, quality, or outcomes of care received by your CHIP population? When will data be available? [7500] In the future, MassHealth anticipates continuing to utilize the Child Core Measure Set in the manner noted above. As new measures are added to the Core Set, MassHealth will evaluate its resources and ability to calc ulate these measures, assess performance on the measures, and identify new opportunities for improvement. Masshealth was part of the Long -Acting Reversible Contraceptive (LARC) ASTHO multi -state collaborative to enhance LARC access in policies and practice. We are following up with work on LARC access, especially in the postpartum period, and have DSRIP funds focused on enhanced provision of training for all methods of birth control, and enhanced training to improve LARC access. Timing and availab ility of data TBD. 3. Have you conducted any focused quality studies on your CHIP population, e.g., adolescents, attention deficit disorder, substance abuse, special heath care needs or other emerging health care needs? What have you found? [7500] No focus ed quality studies were undertaken this year. CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 66 4. Please attach any additional studies, analyses or other documents addressing outreach, enrollment, access, quality, utilization, costs, satisfaction, or other aspects of your CHIP program's performance.

You will not be able to enter responses with characte rs greater than the limit indicated in the brackets. Section IIIA: Outreach 1. How have you redirected/changed your outreach strategies during the reporting period? [7500] The Outreach and Education Unit coordinates statewide outreach activities, disseminates educational materials related to MassHealth and ACOs/MCOs, and collaborates with state and community -based agencies. This coordination helps prevent the duplication of outreach efforts in the community, strengthens the knowledge of providers and residents , and provides information to help individuals make smart choices about health coverage. The overall functions of the Unit include: managing and providing oversight to outreach and enrollment grant programs; supporting and managing training and technical a ssistance for community providers, partners, certified assisters (including Certified Application Counselors (CACs) and Navigators), and grantee organizations around health care reform policy and program changes; and coordinating and collaborating with sta te agencies around state and federal health care policies, messaging, and outreach activities. On March 1, 2018, MassHealth managed care options were expanded to include integrated, accountable care models. Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) are provider -led organizations that coordinate care, have an enhanced role for primary care, and are rewar ded for value - better cost and outcomes - not volume. This rollout impacted roughly 1.2M MassHealth managed care eligible members. On July 1, 2018, MassHealth launched the Community Partner program. Behavioral Health (BH) and Long -Term Services and Sup ports (LTSS) Community Partners (CPs) are community -based entities that work with Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) and Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) to provide care management and coordination to certain members identified by MassHealth, ACOs, and MCOs. BH CPs provide supports to certain members with significant behavioral health needs, including serious mental illness and addiction. LTSS CPs provide supports to certain members with complex LTSS needs, such as children and adults with physical and developmental disabilities and brain injuries. MassHealth members enrolled in an ACO or MCO may be eligible to participate in the CP Program. Where members have other state agency or provider supports, CPs will supplement and coordinate with those supp orts but will not duplicate the functions provided by them. Outreach and training on these significant changes continued in FFY19. 2. What methods have you found most effective in reaching low -income, uninsured children (e.g., T.V., school outreach, word -of-mouth)? How have you measured effectiveness? [7500] We have found the following methods to be most effective in reaching low -income, uninsured children: MassHealth outreach staffs facilitated enrollment events collaborating with local health centers and partner organizations across the Commonwealth. Events help members' complete renewals and health plan selection. Enrollment events are opportunities for new applicants and CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 68 current members to attend, meet with MassHealth staff to ask questions about their c overage, and seek assistance in understanding how to use their health care. These events were to reach individuals where they are and conduct services in a way that meets the individual's needs. MassHealth continues to fund and provide leadership for the Massachusetts Health Care Training Forum (MTF) program. MTF is a partnership between MassHealth and MassAHEC Network at the University of MA Medical School (UMMS). MTF utilizes a range of communication methods to reach health and human service workers in v arious fields to communicate State public health insurance related program and policy information, as well as information about related State programs. Communication methods include a total of 16 regional meetings held throughout the fiscal year in 4 regio ns of the State, program updates/e -mail communications and a regularly updated program website which features a number of resources and tools, including a growing number of State program webinar opportunities. The quarterly in -person meetings feature prese ntations to keep health care organizations and community agencies that serve MassHealth members, the uninsured, and underinsured informed of the latest changes in MassHealth and overall state and federal health care policies. MassHealth presents informatio n about programmatic operations and policy changes and often leading community advocates often share updates about policy developments in state and federal health care. MTF also provides information via a listserv of approximately 7,326 members, and a webs ite offering resource information and meeting materials. The website had approximately 32,000 page views in FFY19. The meetings promote information dissemination, sharing of best practices, and building of community and public sector linkages in order to i ncrease targeted outreach and member education information about MassHealth. In SFY19, MTF program attendance totaled 1,810 in person with another 1,333 who attended via webinars and conference call meetings. 3. Which of the methods described in Question 2 w ould you consider a best practice(s)? [7500] All of the methods referenced in #2 are considered a best practice. It's very effective to reach individuals where they are in the community and to conduct services in a cultural and linguistic fashion that mee ts the individual's needs. 4. Is your state targeting outreach to specific populations (e.g., minorities, immigrants, and children living in rural areas)? Yes No Have these efforts been successful, and how have you measured effectiveness? [7500] The Membe r Education Unit conducts in -service presentations to various organizations including but not limited to: Native American Indian Tribes; School Nurses; School -based Medicaid Programs; sister state agencies such as the Department of Public Health (DPH), Dep artment of Mental Health, Department of Children and Families, Department of Developmental Services, Department of Veteran's Services, and the Bureau of Addiction Services at DPH; Community Action Councils; the Brain Injury Association of Massachusetts; va rious ethnic cultural organizations (including the Latino, Vietnamese, Brazilian, and Somalian populations), advocates for the homeless, shelters, and other facilities working with the homeless population, Senior Care Organizations, the Massachusetts Head Start Program, Family Support Groups, and the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Youth Support Project. These presentations provide education on a variety of topics including: MassHealth benefits; coverage types; covered services; rights and responsib ilities; navigation tools such as website searching; how to access the MAhealthconnector.org; how to access other state health insurance programs; the application process; and post -enrollment information on how to maintain health coverage once it has been obtained. Member Education offers continued support to these organizations via e -mail and telephone in order to ensure proper procedure and an expedited service to the members. These efforts have been successful by encouraging new applicants, dispelling an y myths about public programs, and assisting members with health insurance coverage retention. CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 69 5. What percentage of children below 200 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) who are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP have been enrolled in those programs? [5] 100 (Identify the data source used). [7500] ACS 2018 Enter any Narrative text related to Section IIIA below. [7500] According to ACS data for 2018, .6% of children under 200% FPL in Massachusetts are uninsured. It is extremely challenging to determine what portion of the remaining uninsured are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP, particularly given uncertainly around the immigration status of such individuals. With that said, given the extremely low uninsurance rate for children for children under 200% FPL and the Commonwealth's extensive efforts to identify and enroll all eligible children, the Commonwealth believes that the number of remaining eligible but unenrolled children is minimal. Since the field above requires a number, we entered 100, but again, we are unable to verify this number. Section IIIB: Substitution of Coverage (Crowd -out) Please answer the following questions as they apply to your state's program (some quest ions are not applicable to Medicaid expansion programs.) Medicaid e xpansi on states should complete applicable responses and indicate those questions that are non -applicable with N/A. Please include percent calculations in your responses when applicable and requested. 1. Does your separate CHIP program require a child to be uninsur ed for a minimum amount of time prior to enrollment (waiting period)? No Yes N/A If no, skip to question 5. If yes, answer questions 2 -4: 2. How many months does your program require a child to be uninsured prior to enrollment? 3. To which groups (includ ing FPL levels) does the period of uninsurance apply? [1000] 4. List all exemptions to imposing the period of uninsurance [1000] Please answer questions 5, 7, 8 (and 6 and 9 if applicable) regar dless of the response the state provided to question 1. 5. Does your program match prospective enrollees to a database that details private insurance status? No Yes N/A 6. If answered yes to question 5, what database? [1000] Health Management Systems (HMS) conducts a monthly State and National data match which identifies health insurance for all MassHealth members. CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 70 7. What percent of individuals screened for CHIP eligibility cannot be enrolled because they have group health plan coverage? [5] 0 a. Of those found to have had employer sponsored insurance and h ave been uninsured for only a portion of the state's waiting period, what percent meet the state's exemptions and federally required exemptions to the waiting period [(# individuals subject to the waiting period that meet an exemption/total # of individual s subject to the waiting period)*100]? [5] 0 8. Do you track the number of individuals who have access to private insurance? Yes No 9. If yes to question 8, what percent of individuals that enrolled in CHIP had access to private health insurance at the time of application during the last federal fiscal year [(# of individuals that had access to private health insurance/total # of individuals enrolled in CHIP)*100]? [5] 9.38 Enter any Narrative text related to Section IIIB below. [7500] Question 2 - MassHealt h has authorization under an 1115 Demonstration to enroll children with employer sponsored insurance at CHIP income levels into MassHealth using Title XIX funding so there are no denials for this reason. As noted in Question 1, MassHealth does not have a waiting period. Section IIIC: Eligibility This subsection should be completed by all states. Medicaid Expansion states should complete applicable responses and indicate those questions that are non -applicable with N/A. Section IIIC: Subpart A: Eligibilit y Renewal and Retention 1. Do you have authority in your CHIP state plan to provide for presumptive eligibility, and have you implemented this? Yes No If yes, a. What percent of children are presumptively enrolled in CHIP pending a full eligibility determination? [5] 0 b. Of those children who are presumptively enrolled, what percent of those children are determined eligible and enrolled upon completion of the full el igibility determination? [5] 27 2. Select the measures from those below that your state employs to simplify an eligibility renewal and retain eligible children in CHIP. Conducts follow -up with clients through caseworkers/outreach workers Sends renewal rem inder notices to all families How many notices are sent to the family prior to disenrolling the child from the program? [500] MassHealth sends one notice to the family advising of the need to submit the annual review. At what intervals are reminder notic es sent to families (e.g., how many weeks before the end of the current eligibility period is a follow -up letter sent if the renewal has not been CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 71 received by the state?) [500] No reminder notices are sent Other, please explain: [500] 3. Which of the above strategies appear to be the most effective? Have you evaluated the effectiveness of any strategies? If so, please describe the evaluation, including data sources and methodology. [7500] All of the above strategies have played an impor tant role in making the process work better for our MassHealth members. MassHealth has not conducted a formal evaluation of each outreach strategy, but rather has measured effectiveness through qualitative reporting from our outreach partners. Past finding s show it's very effective to follow -up with individuals where they are in the community, conducting services in a cultural and linguistic fashion that meets the individual's needs. Tying enrollment and outreach events to current affairs, such as a Family Fun Day sponsored by the MA Dept. of Children and Families or back to school campaign, is also key to success since these are a natural draw for individuals to attend.

Duration Measure of Selected Children, Ages 0 -16, Enrolled in Title XIX and Title XXI, Second Quarter FFY 2018 The purpose of tables 3a and 3b is to measure the duration, or continuity, of Medicaid and CHIP enrollees' coverage. This information is required by Section 402(a) of CHIPRA. Reporting on this table is required . The measure is designed to capture continuity of coverage for a co hort of children in title XIX and title XXI for 18 months of enrollment. This means that reporting spans two CARTS reports over two years, with enrollment status at 6 months being reported in the first reporting ye ar, and 12 and 18 month enrollment status reported in the second reporting year. States identify a new cohort of children every two years. States identify newly enrolled children in the second quarter of FFY 2018 (January, February, and March of 2018) for the FFY 2018 CARTS report. This same co hort of children will be reported on in the FFY 2019 CARTS report for the 12 and 18 month status of children newly identified in quarter 2 of FFY 2018 If your eligibility system already has the capability to track a cohort of enrollees over time, an addit ional \"flag\" or unique identifier may not be necessary. The FFY 2019 CARTS report is the second year of reporting in the cycle of two CARTS reports on the cohort of children identif ied in the second quarter of FFY 2018. For the FFY 2018 report, States only reported on lines 1 -4a of the tables. In the FFY 2019 report, no updates will be made to lines 1-4a. For the FFY 2019 report, data will be added to lines 5 -10a.The next cohort of children will be identified in the second quarter of the FFY 2020 (January, February and March of 2020). Instructions : For this measure, please identify newly enrolled children in both title XIX (for Table 3a) and title XXI (for Table 3b) in the second quarter of FFY 2018, ages 0 months to 16 years at time of enrollment. Children enrolled in January 2018 must have birthdates after July 2001 (e.g., children must be younger than 16 years and 5 months) to ensure that they will not age out of the program at the 18th month of coverage. Simil arly, children enrolled in February 2018 must have birthdates after August 2001, and children enrolled in March 2018 must have birthdates after September 2001. Each child newly enrolled during this time frame needs a unique identifier or \"flag\" so that the cohort can be tracked over time. If your e ligibility system already has the capability to track a cohort of enrollees over time, an additional \"flag\" or unique identifier may not be necessary. Please follow the child based on the child's age category at the time of enrollment (e.g., the child's a ge at enrollment creates an age cohort that does not change over the 18 month time span) Please enter the data requested in the tables below, and the template will tabulate the percentages. In the FFY 2019 report you will enter data on lines 5 -7a related to the 12 -month enrollment status of children identified on line 1. You will also enter data on lines 8 -10a related to the 18 -month enrollment status of children identified on line 1. Only enter a \"0\" (zero) if the data are known to be zero. If data are unknown or unavailable, leave the field blank. Note that all data must sum correctly in order to save and move to the next page . The data in each individual row must add across to sum to the total in the \"All Children Ages 0 -16\" column for that row. And in each column, the data within each time period (6, 12 and 18 months) must each sum up to the data in row 1, which is the number of children in the cohort. This means that in each column, rows 2, 3 and 4 must sum to the tot al in row 1; rows 5, 6 and 7 mu st sum to row 1; and rows 8, 9 and 10 must sum to row 1. These tables track a child's enrollment status over time, so when data are added or modified at each milestone (6, 12, and 18 months), there should always be the same total number of children account ed for in line 1 \"All Children Ages 0 -16\" over the entire 18 month period. Rows numbered with an \"a\" (e.g., rows 3a and 4a) are excluded from the totals because they are subsets of their respective ro ws. The system will not move to the next section of the report until all applicable sections of the table for the reporting year are complete and sum correctly to line 1.

Yes, please answer questions below. No, skip to Program Integrity subsection.

Please indicate which adults your state covers with premium assistanc e. (Check all that apply.) Parents and Caretaker Relatives Pregnant Women 3. Briefly describe how your program operates (e.g., is your program an employer sponsored insurance program or a premium assistance program, how do you coordinate assistance bet ween the state and/or employer, who receives the subsidy if a subsidy is provided, etc.) [7500] Premium Assistance maximizes private insurance by providing premium assistance if an uninsured child has access to coverage through employer -based insurance, a nd only offering direct coverage through MassHealth if there is no other access to health insurance. For all applicants, the Commonwealth performs a health insurance investigation, accessing a comprehensive database. Contact is made with all employed membe rs of the household and their employers to determine if employer -sponsored insurance (ESI) is available that meets the basic benefit level, is cost effective and meets an employer contribution level of 50%. If MassHealth - qualifying ESI is available, applic ants may receive premium assistance, but may not receive direct coverage. MassHealth does not allow the family to opt out of ESI in order to obtain direct public coverage. This process controls crowd -out by maximizing the state's opportunity to identify applicants with access to ESI and require enrollment into that coverage. Once access to ESI is confirmed, children's parents must enroll them in the ESI with premium assistance or the child's MassHealth will be terminated. Children must be uninsured at the t ime of application to be eligible for CHIP funding. If they are insured at the time of application they will be eligible for Title XIX under our 1115 waiver. MassHealth monitors health insurance status of potential members both at the time of application a nd monthly so that only uninsured children are covered in CHIP. Insurance status is verified through national insurance databases that identify coverage from any source, including noncustodial parents. CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 85 MassHealth contracts with Health Management Systems ( HMS) which conducts monthly state and national data matches identifying health insurance for all potential members. MassHealth also has a dedicated process to match with a file from the Department of Revenue (DOR) to identify noncustodial parents of applic ants and recipients who have court orders for medical support. This process allows us to not only verify existing coverage, but also to enforce the obligation of non -custodial parents by contacting their employers to arrange enrollment of the parent in an employer -sponsored family plan to cover their children. 4. What benefit package does the ESI program use? [7500] Secretary approved per the State Plan amendment approved in March 2002 5. Are there any minimum coverage requirements for the benefit package? Yes No 6. Does the program provide wrap -around coverage for benefits? Yes No 7. Are there limits on cost sharing for children in your ESI program? Yes No 8. Are there any limits on cost sharing for adults in your ESI program? Yes No 9. Are there protections on cost sharing for children (e.g., the 5 percent out -of-pocket maximum) in your premium assistance program? Yes No If yes, how is the cost sharing tracked to ensure it remains within the 5 percent yearly aggregate maximum [7500] ? Parents of eligible children are notified of the family out of pocket maximum (calculated using 5 percent of the family income less anticipated required member contribution towards ESI plan). Parents submit receipts for cost incurred and once 5 percent cap am ount is met, children receive MassHealth wrap benefits for remainder of family cap year. 10. Identify the total number of children and adults enrolled in the ESI program for whom Title XXI funds are used during the reporting period (provide the number of adult s enrolled in this program even if they were covered incidentally, i.e., not explicitly covered through a demonstration). 0 Number of childless adults ever -enrolled during the reporting period 754 Number of adults ever -enrolled during the reporting period 7607 Number of children ever -enrolled during the reporting period CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 86 11. Provide the average monthly enrollment of children and parents ever enrolled in the premium assistance program during FFY 2019 . Children 20267 Parents 6184 12. During the reporting period, what has been the greatest challenge your ESI program has experienced? [7500] The greatest challenge for the ESI program has been and continues to be the maintenance of household information relating to employment and health i nsurance plan benefits meeting the qualifying standards for coverage (ESI plans are steadily increasing deductibles and out of pocket maximums, health Insurance premiums are increasing, more employers are offering High Deductible Health Plans with Health S avings Accounts). 13. During the reporting period, what accomplishments have been achieved in your ESI program? [7500] The Premium Assistance Unit continues work toward the goal of increasing enrollment into the program by making enhancements to streamline th e process of investigating referrals for access to ESI. This includes targeted approaches to analyzing and working referral files and enhancing relationships with employers to get more timely and accurate updated information. Enrollment numbers have steadi ly increased over the course of the year due to consistent efforts. 14. What changes have you made or are planning to make in your ESI program during the next fiscal year? Please comment on why the changes are planned. [7500] The goal of the Premium Assistan ce program is to increase enrollment into the program by use of streamlined investigation processes, enhanced employer reporting as well as system enhancements to better identify members with potential access to ESI, improved program applications/member co mmunication and increased outreach to members and employers. The changes are being implemented as cost avoidance/cost savings measures. 15. What do you estimate is the impact of your ESI program (including premium assistance) on enrollment and retention of chi ldren? How was this measured? [7500] There are several factors that MassHealth looks at when measuring the impact of the ESI program on retention of children. The Premium Assistance program allows MassHealth to enroll more members into the program because of the cost savings incurred by helping Medicaid eligible members enroll into private health insurance. Because MassHealth helps purchase family plans household members that are not Medicaid eligible are also covered. Enrolling families in ESI is critical to retention of children in the program. MassHealth analyzes how many policies are purchased in order to determine cost avoidance and cost savings. 16. Provide the average amount each entity pays towards coverage of the dependent child/parent under your ESI p rogram: Population State Employer Employee Child 314 157 157 Parent 150 75 75 CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 87 17.

If you offer a premium assistance program, what, if any, is the minimum employer contribution? [500] Employers must contribute at least 50% toward the cost of the health insurance. 19. Please provide the income levels of the children or families provided prem ium assistance. Income level of From To Children 0 % of FPL [5] 300 % of FPL [5] Parents 0 % of FPL [5] 300 % of FPL [5] 20. Is there a required period of uninsurance before enrolling in premium assistance? Yes No If yes, what is the period of uninsurance? [500] 21. Do you have a waiting list for your program? Yes No 22. Can you cap enrollment for your program? Yes No 23. What strategies has the state found to be effective in reducing administrative barriers to the provision of premium assistance in ESI? [7500] Since Premium Assistance investigates employers and the insurance offered to employees, maintaining an employer database is critical in facilitating the investigation process. The process allows MassHealth to gather all of the ESI information that an employer offers including: the names of all health insurance plans the employer offers, premiums and tiers, annual open enrollment rates,summary of benefits for each health insurance offered. This pro cess of gathering and storing current employer insurance information streamlines the determination when other members are being reviewed and are employed by the same employer. The database is updated annually, during the open enrollment periods. Enter any Narrative text related to Section IIIE below.

Does your state have a written plan that has safeguards and establishes methods and procedures for: (1) prevention: Yes No (2) investigation: Yes No (3) referral of cases of fraud and abuse? Yes No Please explain: [7500] It is important to point out that in Massachusetts Medicaid and CHIP are managed and operated seamlessly as one program known as the MassHealth program. Therefore, while there are no separate fraud and abuse activities for CHIP, all methods and procedures employed by the Commonwealth to detect, investigate, and refer cases of fraud and abuse in the Medicaid program are brought to bear on CHIP. In Massachusetts, state staff performs all application, redetermination, matching, case maintenance, and referral p rocesses for all MassHealth programs, including CHIP. All contractual arrangements regarding fraud and abuse activities apply to CHIP as well as Medicaid. MassHealth emphasizes aggressive management of its front -end program processes to ensure that servic es provided are medically necessary, provided by qualified health care providers, provided to eligible residents of the Commonwealth, and that payments are appropriately made. Ongoing efforts to combat fraud, waste, and abuse, including utilization managem ent and regular program and clinical review, are central to all program areas. Sophisticated information systems support MassHealth's efforts to detect inappropriate billings before payment is made, and to ensure that eligibility determinations are accurat e. MassHealth implemented a pre -payment predictive modeling solution in June 2013. The predictive modeling tool uses sophisticated algorithms to analyze claims, builds provider profiles of suspicious billing patterns and assigns risk scores to potentially inappropriate claims. MassHealth Program Integrity continues to participate in the PARIS match. Equally important are mechanisms for detailed reporting and review of claims after bills are paid to identify inappropriate provider behavior, and methods to e nsure that MassHealth identifies members whose changed circumstances may affect their continuing eligibility.As with our front - CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 89 end processes, information systems are a critical component of MassHealth's work to identify and address inappropriate payments. Post-payment activities are an important \"second look\" and are particularly important to the identification of prosecutable fraud. And when our systems identify potential fraud, MassHealth acts aggressively to pursue the case with the appropriate authorit ies. MassHealth has the following documentation regarding established methods and procedures for prevention, investigation, and referral of cases of fraud and abuse: 1) MassHealth Program Integrity Activities Inventory 2) Efforts to Prevent a nd Identify Fraud, Waste, and Abuse \u2014description and identification of responsible units 3) Provider Compliance activity sheet 4) Utilization Management plan 5) Memorandum of Understanding between the Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS) and the Office of the Attorney General, Massachusetts Medicaid Fraud Control Unit 6) Interdepartmental Service Agreement between EOHHS and the Department of Revenue (DOR) 7) MassHealth Eli gibility Operations Memo 04 -04 re: New Member Fraud Referral Process 8) MassHealth Eligibility Operations Memo 01 -7 re: Department of Revenue \"New Hire\" Match 9) MassHealth Eligibility Operations Memo 99 -14 re: Annual Eligibility R eview Process for Health Care Reform Members on MA -21 10) Contract between EOHHS and MedStat Group to perform Program Integrity gap analysis \u2014deliverables dated June 30, 2005. 11) Eligibility Verification System (EVS)codes \u2014online s ystem for providers to verify MassHealth eligibility at point of service 12) Managed care contract language specifying program integrity and fraud and abuse prevention, detection, and reporting requirements for health plans contracting with MassHealth MassHealth Eligibility Operations Memo 01 -7 re: Department of Revenue \"New Hire\" Match Do managed health care plans with which your program contracts have written plans?

Does your state rely on contractors to perform the above functions? Yes, please answer question below. No 5. If your state relies on contractors to perform the above functions, how does your state provide oversight of those contractors? Please explain: [7500] The Provider Compliance Unit, operated within the University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS), and managed by the MassHealth Program Integrity Unit, is our primary post -payment fraud detection unit. Utilizing algorithms and reports found in our data warehouse, and through data analysis, the Provider Compliance Unit reviews paid claims data to detect aberrant trends and outlier billing patterns that can indicate potential fraud. The Provider Compliance Unit works closely with Program Integrity to meet our federal regulatory obligation to establish a surveillance utilization control system to safeguard against fraudulent, abusive, and inappropriate use of the Medicaid and CHIP programs. Additionally, MassHealth oversees a Third Party Administrator cont ract with Optum which is responsible for carrying out program integrity activities, including on -site audits, desk reviews and algorithms, focused on long -term supports and services (LTSS) providers. MassHealth Program Integrity works closely with Optum ac ross multiple weekly coordination calls and provides detailed input on all audit findings of non -compliance and associated overpayments. MassHealth Program Integrity also works across units engaged in program integrity to coordinate activities, establish unit specific internal control plans and risk assessments, manage external audit activity, coordinate the CMS Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM), and establish and monitor compliance with information privacy and security requirements. Our MMIS system p rocesses provider claims and contains a significant number of sophisticated edits, rules, and other program integrity checks and balances. As a result, in both FFY18 and FFY19 approximately 22% of all claims submitted were denied and 1% were suspended for manual review, verification and pricing. The MMIS has been designed with enhanced Program Integrity capabilities, including expanded functionality to add claims edits as needed in order to keep abreast with the latest trends in aberrant or fraudulent claim s submissions. Generally, information systems support to MassHealth remains a significant priority of the Executive Office CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 91 of Health and Human Services, in large part because of the potential of leveraging technology to combat fraud, waste, and abuse in th e Medicaid and CHIP programs. The EOHHS Data Warehouse, for example, is a consolidated repository of claims and eligibility data that provides program and financial managers with the ability to develop standard and ad -hoc management reports. The Claims Op erations Unit manages our claims processing contractor and monitors claims activity weekly. The EOHHS Office of Financial Management organizes a weekly Cash Management Team made up of budget, program, and operations staff that closely monitors the weekly p rovider claims payroll and compares year -to-date cash spending with budgeted spending by both provider type and budget category. The prior authorization unit ensures that certain services are medically necessary before approving the service. Even more soph isticated measures are in place for the pharmacy program. The Drug Utilization Review program at UMMS monitors and audits pharmacy claims and is designed to prevent early refills, therapeutic duplication, ingredient duplication, and problematic drug -drug i nteraction. In February 2004, our Managed Care Program instituted required reporting on fraud and abuse protections for all of MassHealth's managed care organizations. Finally, MassHealth contracts with two vendors, one who supports the Office of Long Ter m Services and Supports (LTSS) and the other that supports the Delivery Service Operations Unit. These two vendors provide customer service to MassHealth members and providers. Our customer service contractors verify the credentials of all providers applyi ng to participate in our program as well as re -credentialing existing providers and will work closely with the Board of Registration in Medicine, the Division of Professional Licensing, the Department of Public Health, the US Department of Health and Human Services, and the Office of the Inspector General to identify disciplinary actions against enrolled providers. 6. Do you contract with managed care health plans and/or a third party contractor to provide this oversight? Yes No Please Explain: [500] MassHealth's contracted managed health care plans provide oversight of their material subcontractors performing program integrity functions.

For exampl e, if a child was enrolled January 1st to March 31st , this child is considered continuously enrolled for at least 90 continuous days in the federal fiscal year. If a child was enrolled from August 1st to September 30th and from October 1st to November 30th, the child would not be considered to have been enrolled for 90 continuous days in the federal fiscal year. Children should be counted in age groupings based on their age at the end of the fiscal year. For example, if a child turned 3 on September 15t h, the child should be counted in the 3 -6 age grouping. 2 Total Enrollees Receiving Any Dental Services - Enter the unduplicated number of children enrolled in a separate CHIP program or the separate CHIP part of a combination program for at least 90 conti nuous days who received at least one dental service by or under the supervision of a dentist as defined by HCPCS codes D0100 - D9999 (or equivalent CDT codes D0100 - D9999 or equivalent CPT codes) based on an unduplicated paid, unpaid, or denied claim. 3 Total Enrollees Receiving Preventive Dental Services - Enter the unduplicated number of children enrolled in a separate CHIP program or the separate CHIP part of a combination program for at least 90 continuous days who received at least one preventive dent al service by or under the supervision of a dentist as defined by HCPCS codes D1000 - D1999 (or equivalent CDT codes D1000 - D1999 or equivalent CPT codes, that is, only those CPT codes CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 94 FFY 2019 Total (All age groups) <1 year 1 - 2 years 3 - 5 years 6 - 9 years 10-14 years 15-18 years Total Enrollees Receiving Dental 73577 13 608 4308 17092 28137 23419 b.

Report all dental services data in the age category reflecting the child's age at the end of the federal fiscal year even if the child received services while in two age categories. For example, if a child turned 10 on September 1st, but had a cleaning in April and a cavity filled in September, both the cleaning and the filling would be counted in the 10 -14 age category. 5 Receiving a Sealant on a Permanent Molar Tooth -- Enter the unduplicated number of children enrolled in a separate C HIP program or the separate CHIP part of a combination program for 90 continuous days and in the age category of 6 -9 who received a sealant on a permanent molar tooth, as defined by HCPCS code D1351 (or equivalent CDT code D1351), based on an unduplicated paid, unpaid, or denied claim. For this line, include sealants placed by any dental professional for whom placing a sealant is within his or her scope of practice. Permanent molars are teeth numbered 2, 3, 14, 15, 18, 19, 30, 31, and additionally, for thos e states that cover sealants on third molars, also known as wisdom teeth, the teeth numbered 1, 16, 17, 32. Report all sealant data in the age category reflecting the child's age at the end of the federal fiscal year even if the child was factually a diffe rent age on the date of service. For example, if a child turned 6 on September 1st, but had a sealant applied in July, the sealant would be counted in the age 6 -9 category. CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 95 Section IIIH: CHIPRA CAHPS Requirement: CHIPRA section 402(a)(2), which amends reporting requirements in section 2108 of the Social Security Act, requires Title XXI Programs (i.e., CHIP Medicaid Expansion programs, Separate Child Health Programs, or a combination of the two) to report CAHPS res ults to CMS starting December 2013. While Title XXI Programs may select any CAHPS survey to fulfill this requirement, CMS encourages these programs to align with the CAHPS measure in the Children's Core Set of Health Care Quality Measures for Medicaid and CHIP (Child Core Set). Starting in 2013, Title XXI Programs should submit summary level information from the CAHPS survey to CMS via the CARTS attachment facility. We also encourage states to submit raw data to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Qua lity's CAHPS Database. More information is available in the Technical Assistance fact sheet, Collecting and Reporting the CAHPS Survey as Required Under the CHIPRA: https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/quality -of- care/downloads/cahpsfactsheet.pdf If a state would like to provide CAHPS data on both Medicaid and CHIP enrollees, the ag ency must sample Title XIX (Medicaid) and Title XXI (CHIP) programs separately and submit separate results to CMS to fulfill the CHIPRA Requirement.

The difference is due to drug rebates and collections adjustments. CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 107 Section V: Program Challenges and Accomplishments 1. For the reporting period, please provide an overview of your state's political and fiscal environment as it relates to health care for low income, uninsured children and families, and how this environment impacted CHIP. [7500] Massachusetts remains commit ted to ensuring health coverage for all of its residents and continues to have the lowest uninsurance rate for children in the country. In order to promote mental health parity and improve access to behavioral health treatment for children and families, both the state legislature and the administration have demonstrated commitment to making state - wide changes. In this context, MassHealth has begun to implement the first of a series of policy changes designed to incentivize timely access to appropriate and effective behavioral health care in community settings. 2. During the reporting period, what has been the greatest challenge your program has experienced? [7500] The greatest challenge is providing the full spectrum of behavioral health services to childre n with the right care at the right time in the right setting. One of MassHealth's highest priorities is to redesign our outpatient behavioral health system to ensure the right care in the right setting can be delivered to all of our members, including chil dren. In recognition of the longstanding difficulties facing children and families who are trying to access behavioral health treatment, both the state legislature and the administration have demonstrated commitment to making state -wide changes. In this co ntext, MassHealth has begun to implement the first of a series of policy changes designed to incentivize access to right -sized and on -time behavioral health care in community settings. Massachusetts' priorities in this area include: Supporting behaviora l health promotion and crisis prevention by moving the intervention point \"upstream\" - away from crisis and 24 -hour behavioral health treatment and toward integrated primary care and outpatient behavioral health treatment Expanding access to same -day urg ent and outpatient mental health and substance use treatment Improving timely access to appropriate, community -based crisis stabilization and evaluation services Increasing the availability of mental health services delivered in schools Enhancing wo rkforce competency to deliver evidence -based models of treatment for youth and families, including dyadic therapy focused on the caregiver -child relationship and specialized treatments for trauma 3. During the reporting period, what accomplishments have been achieved in your program? [7500] Massachusetts is very proud of the health insurance coverage we provide to children in the Commonwealth and our standing as the state with the lowest uninsurance rate in FFY19. During FFY19 MassHealth reported on 22 of th e 26 Child Core Set measures, an important step in achieving mandatory reporting of the full child core set in 2024. 4. What changes have you made or are planning to make in your CHIP program during the next fiscal year? Please comment on why the changes are planned. [7500] We have recently redoubled our commitment to children in our combined CHIP and Medicaid program by creating a leadership position to support the development and implementation of a CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2019 108 children's health policy agenda. This Senior Directo r will work closely with the CHIP Director and other MassHealth staff on children's coverage issues. The initial focus of the Senior Director will be across three areas: 1.
