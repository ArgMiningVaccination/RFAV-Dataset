She is the founder and creator of Chakrubs, The Original Crystal Sex Toy Company, and she continues to receive testimonials from people around the world who use her Chakrub products and methods. These overwhelmingly positive testimonials have inspired her to write Crystal Healing and Sacred Pleasure. Since conceptualizing her initial designs for crystal pleasure tools in 2011, and establishing her brand in 2012, Cuccia has been an influencer in the social movement of sex positivity, self-love, and personal awareness by bridging the gap between sensuality and spirituality. As creator of products that symbolize the essence of these movements, she spearheaded the ethos of the brand which is inspiring many to nurture their own emotional intelligence, self-awareness, and spiritual connection. Cuccia cultivated her knowledge of crystals and energy work while she was living in LA to pursue a career in music. During this time she worked a part-time job at an adult store where she fostered her education on sex positivity. Cuccia merged both principals, which sparked the idea of sexual exploration with the use of crystals. The recognition for the potential crystals have to facilitate energy movement inspired Cuccia to utilize crystals to enhance sexual pleasure. Cuccia's work has been a fixture in the Hammer Museum and Museum of Sex, featured in magazines such as New York Magazine, Cosmopolitan, Elle and Allure, appeared on notable digital platforms such as Buzzfeed and VICE, and has been featured on shows such as The Doctors and Conan. Cuccia has also received the attention of many notable artists who have collaborated with their own sensibility, bringing to light different aspects of the profound messages Chakrubs inspires. As a certified crystal healer and reiki practitioner, Cuccia continues to pursue knowledge of crystals and metaphysical modes of healing to help those who have experienced sexual trauma or simply wish to deepen pleasure and connection to self, spirit, and others. Cuccia is a musician whose knowledge of energy extends through her performances. She currently resides in New York. "}
