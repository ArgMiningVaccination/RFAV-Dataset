However, for this second part, I thought that it would be useful to lay out some of the basic definitions of vaccinology. Despite the new high-profile attention on vaccines, I still see many people misusing terms like immunogenicity, efficacy and effectiveness when discussing vaccines. Even the experts wheeled out on TV and radio seem prone to this and the printed media rarely get it right. I will then finish this part with a quick \"vaccine scorecard\" using each of the definitions to show where we are so far. I have made the scorecard the cover image of this article for those who are not going to have the energy or the willpower to read all of my ramblings. The scorecard headline is: good early data in young healthy adults, nothing in any other age or risk group, no red flags, but a long way still to go. So, let's start with the definitions of vaccine immunogenicity, efficacy and effectiveness because misrepresenting or misunderstanding these terms can result in false interpretation of data and false expectations for future vaccines. These non-interchangeable terms are used to describe the results of vaccination and often appear in descriptions of clinical trials. In my experience they are misused almost as often as they are correctly used, even in the scientific press and literature. For the purpose of this brief overview I will assume that the vaccine is directed against a virus, like the one that causes Covid-19, but wherever used in this article the word virus could be replaced with bacteria or parasite or most other \"foreign\" entities. For the scientifically literate, please excuse my simplifications. - Vaccine Immunogenicity: this is the effect that the vaccine has on the immune system of an individual or a group of individuals. In simple terms, the immune response may be mediated by antibodies (humoral immunity) or by T-cells (cellular immunity). Both humoral and cellular immune responses are targeted at very small parts of the virus that the immune system can recognize as \"foreign\" or \"non-self\" and these small regions are known as Epitopes. It is important here to note that vaccine immunogenicity alone tells us nothing about the occurrence of the disease or the ability of the vaccine to prevent disease. An immunogenic vaccine may make the disease better or worse or have no meaningful effect at all. - Vaccine Efficacy: this is the effect that the vaccine has on the occurrence of the target disease in a group of vaccinated individuals under ideal (clinical trial) conditions. In a clinical trial of people vaccinated and then exposed to the virus, we can determine the overall efficacy of the vaccine as the % of individuals protected from the disease by the vaccine (see the formula below). The important point is that vaccine efficacy can only be measured in a vaccinated population who are then exposed to the virus over a period of time in order to see if they get the disease or not. In other words, vaccine immunogenicity does not equal vaccine efficacy (this is probably the commonest mistake made in the popular press but also in some scientific literature). - Vaccine Effectiveness: this is the effect of the vaccine on disease occurrence when used under real world conditions. At first glance, this may seem to be very similar to vaccine efficacy, but there are very important differences, and many are particularly relevant for the current pandemic. Whilst vaccine efficacy is obviously important, vaccine effectiveness is also dependent upon how that vaccine is then used in a vaccination campaign. Vaccine Effectiveness is thus a public health issue with important health policy and political implications and is dependent upon, inter alia, how quickly the vaccine is rolled out to the population; whether the vaccine is mandatory or voluntary; which age groups and at risk groups are vaccinated and what the vaccination compliance rate is. Vaccine effectiveness is also impacted by other health policy factors such as social distancing and mask wearing. Finally, vaccine effectiveness will also be impacted by external factors including the level of pre-existing immunity in the community; the level of circulating virus and many socio-economic factors. Vaccine effectiveness is thus dynamic and will vary from place to place and from time to time. A key phenomenon in vaccine effectiveness is Herd Immunity, which occurs when there is sufficient immunity in the population to effectively prevent person to person spread. Achieving herd immunity is a key objective for a vaccination campaign since it will protect both vaccinated and unvaccinated people from the disease and thus greatly enhance vaccine effectiveness. As you can see, vaccine immunogenicity can lead to vaccine efficacy, which in turn can lead to vaccine effectiveness but those linkages are neither simple nor guaranteed. The fourth key definition is vaccine safety, which is both self-explanatory and poorly understood (as evidence by the ongoing anti-vaxx movement). As articulated in Part 1, the safety profile of a prophylactic vaccine needs to be exceptionally clean. However, it is not possible to detect exceptionally rare side effects without testing the vaccine in exceptionally large populations (rare things happen rarely). In effect, very rare side effects are often only detected when the vaccine is first used in large scale immunization campaigns such that early vaccination campaigns are in essence late-stage or post-marketing clinical trials. By definition, a risk-benefit analysis for any vaccine is impossible without understanding both risk and benefit, so early vaccine roll-out needs to be carefully planned and managed. When we look at vaccine immunogenicity, it is important to think of the correlates of protection. This means that we need to know which immunological changes will lead to vaccine efficacy and which will not. For example, if the vaccine induces the body to produce an antibody that binds to an epitope on an important viral protein then that immune response could prevent that protein from working and may result in vaccine efficacy. If it did, then that immune response would be said to correlate with efficacy, but many immune responses will not correlate with efficacy. It is thus possible to have strong immunogenicity but not have vaccine efficacy. It is even possible that immunogenicity could lead to worsening of the disease. Importantly there can be species differences for both immunogenicity and correlates of protection such that studies in animals including mice or even monkeys may not predict immunogenicity or efficacy in humans. Critically, if we don't know the correlates of protection, then we can't accurately predict the chances of achieving efficacy or effectiveness. One way to determine whether an immune response might correlate with protection is to measure neutralizing antibodies in a neutralization assay. Neutralizing antibodies are antibodies that prevent a virus from harming a cell by neutralizing any effect that it has on the cell. Neutralizing assays can thus predict potential disease prevention because they demonstrate not only that the antibodies are present but that those antibodies have a useful biological function. However, neutralizing assays are conducted in vitro (outside of the body) and can not be regarded as a correlate of protection until clinical studies demonstrate a correlating vaccine efficacy. Neutralizing antibodies are thus encouraging but not definitive proof of potential efficacy. As we age, our immune system becomes less efficient and this phenomenon is known as Immunosenescence. So, a vaccine that produces a certain level of immunogenicity and efficacy in young adults (defined here as 18 to 55 years old) may have a lower immunogenicity and efficacy in the elderly (over 55) and this problem tends to increase with increasing age. It is also possible that the elderly may have different pre-existing immunological patterns, since they have had more years of potential exposure to earlier viruses with a similar structure and epitopes. Finally, vaccines may have a different safety profile in the elderly compared to younger adults. It is thus important to conduct vaccine clinical trials in the elderly (over 55) as well as younger adults (18 to 55). One way to achieve vaccine effectiveness in the elderly is to achieve herd immunity such that vaccination of the elderly is not necessary. However, achieving herd immunity for Covid-19 will probably require widespread vaccination of children (under-18). This will produce an ethical and social dilemma, since children are now known to be at relatively low risk from Covid-19. Once again, those under 18 may exhibit a different safety and efficacy pattern to those over 18. Safety and efficacy in the elderly, children and other at risk groups will be something to look out for in future clinical trials. Finally, before getting on to an analysis of our vaccine scorecard (and this is for the geeks), here is the definition of vaccine efficacy in the form of an equation (skip this if you have no interest in the maths involved): Vaccine Efficacy = 100% x (ARU - ARV)/ARU Where: ARU = disease rate in the un-vaccinated population = CU/nU ARV = disease rate in the vaccinated population = CV/nV and CV and CU are the number of confirmed cases in the vaccinated and un-vaccinated groups respectively and nV and nU are the number of subjects in the vaccinated and un-vaccinated groups respectively. So, Vaccine Efficacy will be zero if the disease occurs equally in the vaccinated and un-vaccinated groups and Vaccine Efficacy is 100% when there is no disease in the vaccine group. However, no vaccine efficacy can be determined if there is no disease in the un-vaccinated group. This is why it is important to conduct vaccine efficacy studies in areas with a high incidence of disease. If the ARU is relatively low then the clinical trial will need to be very large and/or take a very long time to detect a meaningful reduction in the ARV. Now, finally let's quickly use all of those definitions and the publicly available data to mark-up the \"vaccine scorecard\" (image at the top of this article) to see where we are so far with the leading vaccines in development for Covid-19. Without getting too much into the weeds, at the level that we are looking and at this very early stage, they are all showing broadly similar signals. Safety: we have initial signals of safety in a relatively small number of healthy young adults for each leading vaccine. There are some dose dependent side effects showing up, including things like fever, lethargy and injection-site pain and the incidence and severity of those look a little worse than for many modern vaccines. However, there is nothing at this stage that signals anything significant in the context of a pandemic vaccine. So, I have marked safety as light green = encouraging early data. Note that we know nothing about safety in children, the elderly or any other high-risk groups, so these are all amber: no data. Immunogenicity: again, all of our publicly available data is in healthy young adults (so, all other groups marked amber). We have good data in small numbers of healthy young adults showing both humoral and cellular responses against spike protein including neutralising antibody responses. I have marked this dark green = strongly encouraging data. However, the main caution is that we do not yet know the correlates of protection, so this immunogenicity may not translate to efficacy. Efficacy and Effectiveness: no data in any age group, so all marked amber. In summary: good early data in young healthy adults, but nothing in any other age or risk group. No red flags, but a long way still to go. Hopefully this is a dashboard that can be filled in as clinical studies progress.
