While the best results will be achieved when doing these therapies with the specified crystals, you are still welcome to learn the therapies. If the crystals are not within your financial means to purchase right away, you can purchase them later. Additionally, if you have a light set or the Information-Energy Reflector wand, some of the therapies learned can be used with those tools. - Are CEU credits available for this course? Currently, we are not able to give CEU credits for this class. - Who is this course good for? This class is a fantastic class to get your \"feet wet\" with learning the Esogetics Crystal therapies and working with slightly higher level therapies (Crystals work from the Information/Chakra level of information). While this is not a Professional-Level Certification course, you do learn powerful and effective therapies while gaining valuable base knowledge of the Esogetics Holistic Medicine system. This class is designed more for non-professionals (home user/self-care) due to the terminology & simplicity of the information while also keeping health professionals and practitioners in mind. Health Professionals who would find the information in this class useful are practitioners in fields like Acupuncturists, Chiropractors, Massage Therapist, Ayurvedic Practitioners (great to combine with Marma therapies), Reiki and other energy work practitioners, Healing Touch Practitioners, and others. - Breaks & Lunch? We will take a 45-minute to 1-hour lunch (on your own) break part way through the class, and have regular breaks through the day. "}
