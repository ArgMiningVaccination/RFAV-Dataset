Offit has been taking the anti-vaccine lobby to task over pseudoscience, and he hasn't been winning many friends in the process: Those backing Dr. Offit say he was forced into the role. Opponents of vaccines have held rallies, appeared on talk shows like \"Oprah\" and \"Imus in the Morning,\" been the heroes of made-for-TV movies and found a celebrity spokeswoman in Jenny McCarthy, the actress and former Playboy model who has an autistic son. Meanwhile, the response from public health officials has been muted and couched in dull scientific jargon. \"If the surgeon general or the secretary of health or the head of the C.D.C. would come out and make a really strong statement on this, I think the whole thing would go away,\" said Dr. Peter J. Hotez, president of the Sabin Vaccine Institute, who has a severely autistic daughter whose disease, he argues, is genetic. Asked why public health officials have been reticent, the acting surgeon general, Dr. Steven K. Galson, issued a statement saying that \"childhood immunizations are one of the greatest achievements of all time\" and that \"scientific evidence clearly shows that vaccines do not contribute to autism.\" He has spoken on issues like obesity, tobacco, air travel and exercise, but his office said he had not been questioned by journalists about vaccines and autism. Dr. Offit's book, published in September by Columbia University Press, has been widely endorsed by pediatricians, autism researchers, vaccine companies and medical journalists who say it sums up, in layman's language, the scientific evidence for vaccines and forcefully argues that vulnerable parents are being manipulated by doctors promoting false cures and lawyers filing class-action suits. \"Opponents of vaccines have taken the autism story hostage,\" Dr. Offit said. \"They don't speak for all parents of autistic kids, they use fringe scientists and celebrities, they've set up cottage industries of false hope, and they're hurting kids. Parents pay out of their pockets for dangerous treatments, they take out second mortgages to buy hyperbaric oxygen chambers. It's just unconscionable.\" Offit's book is on my too-read list. I too would appreciate strongs statements for policy-makers and regulators clearly stating that vaccines do not cause autism. Particularly I would appreciate it from [Sanjay Gupta if he becomes surgeon general.](http://scienceblogs.com/purepedantry/2009/01/sanjay_gupta_is_a_possible_sur.php) The debate over vaccines and autism -- not really a debate on facts because the facts are clear, mostly just shouting -- is becoming in my mind a test case of how we convey scientific information to the public. If we step back and allow cranks to control the discourse, well, that is exactly what they are going to do. On the other hand, simply making explicit what the science says may not be enough. The authors of the NYTimes article mention actress Amanda Peet's activism promoting vaccines. Anti-vaccine groups -- and anti-psychiatry groups associated with Scientology -- have been using celebrity spokespeople for years. But this can cut both ways: there is no reason that the proponents of science can't use them as well. Another example is the [We campaign](http://www.wecansolveit.org/) which utilizes politicians from both sides of the political spectrum to help fix global warming. I think Offit's book is an important first step -- making the case clear. But now we need to go out and sell that case to a massive audience. The consequences of failing to do so in terms of recurrent childhood infectious diseases are too fearful to contemplate.
