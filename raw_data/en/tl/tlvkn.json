Using three or more herbs together gives a more interesting and pleasant fragrance. You can add rose petals to your choice of herbs to further improve the scent. - To avoid clogging the drain, and making a mess in the tub, never add loose herbs directly to the bath water. Place desired herbs in a bath bag (which acts similar to a large tea bag) or make an herbal infusion, see instructions below. - While we don't offer specific amounts of herbs to use when crafting your bath mix (most use equal parts of each), in general use a total of 3-4 ounces of herb mixture per tub. - The bath water should be hot enough to release the herbal essences, but not hot enough to burn your skin. - If desired, place a small pillow behind your head. Lie back and relax in the tub for 15 to 20 minutes. To Make An Herbal Bath Infusion To make a concentrated bath infusion, place 2 ounces of dried, or 4 ounces of fresh, herbs into a quart-sized jar. Pour 1 pint of boiling water into the glass jar. Affix the lid and set aside. Leave the concoction undisturbed for a minimum of 30 minutes while it infuses. While filling your tub with very warm water, strain the infusion through a sieve. Pour the infusion into the tub, sit back, relax, and enjoy! (Discard herbs after using.) Try This Relaxing Bedtime Bath Fill a bath bag or make an infusion with equal parts of these soothing herbs: lavender, hops, chamomile, and lemon balm. Place the herbal bag under the running water as the tub fills. Or add an infusion to your bath water. Lay back and unwind. Important Note: Be careful with herbs around pets as some are toxic to them.
