But I can't stand the smell of most of them\u2014they're too strong and fake. But what I do love is the smell of essential oils. It's easy as can be to make your own essential oil room sprays with just a glass spritzer bottle and water, alcohol, and essential oils. Here's how to to make your own natural air freshener with just three simple ingredients! How to Make Essential Oil Room Sprays Using essential oils in a spray does more than just freshen a space, it can imbue the air with aromatherapy benefits for your central nervous system so you can relax, heal, and feel more energized whenever you like [ [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23531112)]. Plus, you can spritz 'em wherever you want\u2014bathroom, kitchen, laundry room, closet, your pillow, anywhere\u2014and you never have to worry about those chemical air freshener smells or pets and children getting hurt with candles. Supplies \u2014 [8-ounce spray bottle](https://amzn.to/3b4mQPF) \u20142 tablespoons vodka \u20146 tablespoons filtered water \u2014Essential oils (see below for specific blends) Instructions 1. Pour the alcohol into a small spray bottle. Add the recommended number of drops of your desired essential oils. 2. Let the oils sit for 5 minutes or so, and then shake well and add the water. 3. Shake again and spritz whenever you need a little pick-me-up. You can make the scent as strong or light as you want by altering the amount of essential oil. I'm partial to [orange](https://amzn.to/2WssZzA) and [jasmine](https://amzn.to/3b31n9I) because they remind me [lemon](https://amzn.to/35v6KND), [bergamot](https://amzn.to/3b8LXRu), [cinnamon](https://amzn.to/2YyLfdA), [rose](https://amzn.to/3b6KoDf), and [rosemary](http://amzn.to/2pON8lz) are very nice too, but you can use just about any essential oil combination that smells good to you. I like to spritz different blends according to my mood, the season, or time of day. If you want to scale the recipe down to use less of your essential oils, then just cut the recipe in half and use a 4-ounce spray bottle and just 1 tablespoon of vodka.

Try these blends to make your [house smell like spring](https://helloglow.co/spring-room-sprays/) or get into the holiday season with a [Christmas scent](https://helloglow.co/christmas-diffuser-blends/). Why vodka? The vodka is an essential ingredient for the room spray. You probably know that oil and water don't mix, but adding a little alcohol fixes that incompatibility. It disperses the oil and also helps the scent to linger longer in the air. Buy the highest proof alcohol that you can find; I often use [grain alcohol](https://helloglow.co/clean-with-everclear/). And definitely go with the cheapest, you don't need to use anything expensive (it doesn't really matter how it tastes or if it is aged). Avoid rubbing alcohol, however, since breathing rubbing alcohol vapors can be bad for the lungs. The bottle Before each use, you will need to shake the bottle of room spray a bit before you spritz so that the essential oil is evenly distributed in the liquid. I reuse or purchase little glass spritzer or spray bottles for the room spray. I get mine at the health food store or [online](https://amzn.to/2ysbRC7). Natural Air Freshener FAQ How long do essential oil room sprays last? Since this room spray recipe contains water, it should be refrigerated and used within two weeks. Can I use gin instead of vodka? I don't recommend it because gin already has a slight fragrance. Instead, you can use witch hazel in place of the alcohol. Do you have to use distilled water? No, but tap water contains chemicals such as chlorine that may affect the smell of your room spray. My spray looks cloudy, what gives? Don't worry\u2014ours does too! It's just what happens when you combine these particular ingredients. It doesn't affect the quality of the spray. Why doesn't my spray have a stronger smell? Rooms spray scent won't linger in the air very long; they're meant for a quick air freshening boost. If your spray doesn't smell strong enough for you, just add more essential oils. Where did you find your bottles? Ours are from Rail19, and you can buy them [here](https://amzn.to/3b4mQPF). Can I use real vanilla extract instead of vanilla essential oil? I don't see why not, although you'll need to experiment to find a ratio that works for you. Also, it may give your room spray a light brown color that can stain white clothing and furniture. Can I use this in my car? Yes, you can give your a car a spritz to freshen things up.
