If a person is going to be affected by vaccines then the first vaccine is going to have a marked impact. For most people in the UK DPT with Polio is this first vaccine. I decided to look at cases where NBWS (never been well since) vaccination had been treated by potentised DPT to see the change in symptoms before and after the remedy. From this I collated a picture of DPT. The Study Kate Diamantopoulo ran a children's clinic for several years. Looking through her case files, together with some cases from Linda Razzell and some of my own, I selected approximately 50 cases where the prescription of DPT 30 had shown a marked reaction at the next visit. I searched through some 500 cases where DPT 30 had been prescribed but I felt it was important to select only those cases which satisfied the following criteria: - A follow up visit after DPT 30 was needed. (Often if the child was better, parents did not return). - There had been relatively little prescribing in the case before DPT 30. This was partly so that the original interview was still valid and also it was not a clear aetiology if the prescriber had not given the remedy early on in the case. - There was a reaction. The prescription would be DPT 30 one day and Polio 30 the next or whichever combination of vaccination had originally been administered. Some cases had DT, omitting the Pertussis, and others didn't have the Polio. Analysis Even though in statistical terms the sample was small, reading five hundred cases to select the fifty made it possible to make general observations. It may not be possible to support them with statistical \"proof\". The intention was to establish clearer ideas of DPT in order to help with future prescribing. The analysis involved a set of \"before and after\" questions and the changes occurring after the prescription were recorded. These were then put into a database and presented as graph. I looked at the symptom groups which were most commonly affected and grouped them together as follows:Sleep (70.5% of cases affected) and Dreams (17.6%), Bowels (41%), Food (43%), Thirst (49%), Urine (10%), Stomach Respiratory Complaints (45%) and Skin (29.5%) SLEEP AND DREAMS: Sleep was the area that was most affected. The \"before\" symptoms seemed to occupy two extremes, those relating to over-activity and those relating to under activity. In the first group there was constant waking, over heating and uncovering, night terrors, difficulty getting to sleep, enuresis and somnambulism. In the second group sleeping long, sleeping in the day, unremembered dreams. It might have been expected that at the follow up visit the child would just be describing in more detail what had previously been called a nightmare but this was not the case. The nightmares stopped after prescribing DPT in potency. The children without dreams often developed dreams (animals and chasing). The effect on enuresis and somnambulism did not come through as a very high percentage. Some of this will be due to the case taking. Particularly with enuresis, parents often fail to mention it initially and I feel these areas should be looked at more closely in the future. BOWELS, FOOD, THIRST, URINE AND STOMACH: Again, in this symptom group there were extremes of symptoms - they had great appetites or no appetite. This was more marked than a particular food craving. The food cravings seemed to be those associated with other remedies that are indicated in the treatment. Commonly they were < eggs and + dairy food. They had extremes of thirst, particularly with extremes of temperature, liking very cold or very hot drinks or having no thirst at all. The extremes of temperature are often reflected elsewhere, sometimes in the appetite but also in frequent baths either hot or cold and the tendency to overheat at night. After the remedy these extremes calmed down and there were also signs of increased and often yellow urine. Their bowels also suffered - being flatulent, loose and smelly rather than having diarrhea or constipation (although these were also recorded). These symptoms tended to improve after the remedy although there was an aggravation at first in some cases. They often complained of stomach pains, in particular pain around umbilicus. In most cases this improved after the remedy. MIND: Although many of these children exhibited a tubercular diathesis and later were prescribed TUBERCULINUM, temper tantrums do seem to be a symptom of DPT as well. Many of the symptoms associated with hyperactive behavior were changed by the remedy DPT (biting, stamping feet, waving arms about, hyperactivity). Equally, symptoms of the other extreme were represented - thumb sucking, lacking confidence, low energy. DPT in potency often showed a marked change that could be described as \"taking the lid off\". Hyperactivity turns into an appreciation of music, lack of confidence turns to anger. Symptoms which you would often expect to find in a child but which have not been apparent in the case-taking appeared after DPT in potency e.g. sibling jealousy starts to be expressed, as does anger. In general the constitutional picture clears. There were also the signs of better health. They did better at school. They made progress with their reading or writing. They communicated better with their parents. They showed the signs of growth which were usually supported in the physical body as well (better co-ordination, new teeth, new growth, new shoes). RESPIRATORY AND SKIN COMPLAINTS: All of the cases had skin or upper respiratory tract problems. In many of them the DPT vaccine had directly exacerbated these complaints and aggravations were similarly very common after prescribing it in potency. Although many of the children had had eczema before the vaccination it had not been taken as a possible contra-indication for vaccination. DPT in potency was followed by either a general clearing out (a cold or flu) or what had been a very serious condition was much ameliorated (Asthma for example was reduced to \"wheezing\").

Expanding the materia medica In Harris Coulter's book Vaccination Social Violence and Criminality (1990) he states: \"Leo Kanner in 1943 described 11 cases of a new mental illness in young people which he called \"inborn autistic disturbances of effective contact\" \" the condition differs markedly and uniquely from anything reported so far...\" This was immediately after the vaccine programme started in the States. He looks at the symptoms of \"Encephalitis, Autism and Minimal Brain Damage and shows that many of the symptoms of these three states are similar and are part of a larger entity - post-encephalitic syndrome - which in turn, is caused primarily by the childhood vaccine programme.\" \" The areas affected are the C.N.S - especially the cranial nerve, the digestive process and the immunological apparatus... When the cranial nerves are affected, the result is the weakness of the eyes, ears, voice, and respiratory system, the latter condition being responsible for the cases of 'sudden infant death' following vaccination.\" He goes on to say: \"If autism is a manifestation of vaccine-induced encephalitis, the implications are very disturbing. The symptoms manifested with pathological intensity in a small group will of necessity appear in a milder form in a much larger proportion of the population. For every \"autistic\" who is shut away in an institution there will be a thousand alienated individuals functioning as normal taxpaying citizens.\" I collated the symptoms as they appeared in the text in the form of a materia medica.
