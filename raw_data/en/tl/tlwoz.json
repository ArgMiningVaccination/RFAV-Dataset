Much of what is now categorized as alternative medicine was developed as independent, complete medical systems, was developed long before biomedicine and use of scientific methods, and was developed in relatively isolated regions of the world where there was little or no medical contact with pre-scientific western medicine, or with each other's systems. Examples are [Traditional Chinese medicine](/en/Traditional_Chinese_medicine), European [humoral theory](/en/Humoral_theory) and the [Ayurvedic medicine](/en/Ayurvedic_medicine) of [India](/en/India). Other alternative medicine practices, such as [homeopathy](/en/Homeopathy), were developed in western Europe and in opposition to western medicine, at a time when western medicine was based on unscientific theories that were dogmatically imposed by western religious authorities. Homeopathy was developed prior to discovery of the basic principles of [chemistry](/en/Chemistry), which proved homeopathic remedies contained nothing but water. But homeopathy, with its remedies made of water, was harmless compared to the unscientific and dangerous orthodox western medicine practiced at that time, which included use of [toxins](/en/Toxin) and [draining of blood](/en/Bloodletting), often resulting in permanent disfigurement or death. [[1]](#cite_note-CHBHAMA-1) Other alternative practices such as [chiropractic](/en/Chiropractic) and [osteopathy](/en/Osteopathy), were developed in the United States at a time that western medicine was beginning to incorporate scientific methods and theories, but the biomedical model was not yet fully established. Practices such as chiropractic and osteopathy, each considered to be irregular by the medical establishment, also opposed each other, both rhetorically and politically with licensing legislation. Osteopathic practitioners added the courses and training of biomedicine to their licensing, and licensed [Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine](/en/Doctor_of_Osteopathic_Medicine) holders began diminishing use of the unscientific origins of the field, and without the original practices and theories, [Osteopathic medicine in the United States](/en/Osteopathic_medicine_in_the_United_States) is now considered the same as biomedicine. Until the 1970s, western practitioners that were not part of the medical establishment were referred to \"irregular practitioners\", and were dismissed by the medical establishment as unscientific or [quackery](/en/Quackery). [[1]](#cite_note-CHBHAMA-1) Irregular practice became increasingly marginalized as quackery and fraud, as western medicine increasingly incorporated scientific methods and discoveries, and had a corresponding increase in success of its treatments. In the 1970s, irregular practices were grouped with traditional practices of nonwestern cultures and with other unproven or disproven practices that were not part of biomedicine, with the group promoted as being \"alternative medicine\". Following the [counterculture movement](/en/Counterculture_movement) of the 1960s, misleading marketing campaigns promoting \"alternative medicine\" as being an effective \"alternative\" to biomedicine, and with changing social attitudes about not using chemicals, challenging the establishment and authority of any kind, sensitivity to giving equal measure to values and beliefs of other cultures and their practices through [cultural relativism](/en/Cultural_relativism), adding [postmodernism](/en/Postmodernism) and [deconstructivism](/en/Deconstructivism) to ways of thinking about science and its deficiencies, and with growing frustration and desperation by patients about limitations and side effects of [evidence-based medicine](/en/Evidence-based_medicine), use of alternative medicine in the west began to rise, then had explosive growth beginning in the 1990s, when senior level political figures began promoting alternative medicine, and began diverting government medical research funds into research of alternative, complementary, and "}
