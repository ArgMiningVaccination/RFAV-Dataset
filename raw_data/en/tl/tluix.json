Closer collaboration is needed for a raft of reasons: the unprecedented complexity of our global system; the accelerating speed of change caused by the ongoing Fourth Industrial Revolution; the insufficiency of our steering mechanism for global governance to deal with current challenges; and populist uprisings around the world driven by a broad-based urge to take back control of society. If we ever lived in a unipolar world, that time is over. If there was ever a political system with absolute sovereignty, it no longer exists. We cannot escape from the reality of Globalization 4.0 through futile attempts to reinforce and restore the global system in its current form. It will take combined and coherent efforts to remodel and strengthen the elements of the system from the base, and to remove the distortions and imbalances among them. The outcomes achieved at the Annual Meeting were due to a multistakeholder and systemic approach. This included work done by our Industry Governors and System Stewards, which produced action-oriented ideas and initiatives; as well as the many productive diplomatic dialogues on humanitarian issues and geopolitical crises. However, we can only bring about positive change in our global system with the contribution of all stakeholders. In Davos, participants were deeply engaged in the sessions, initiatives and projects of our organization. Now, we must continue this work and forge ahead in multiple constructive steps. Whether you are active in our work on oceans, climate change, inclusive digital globalization or any other initiative: it is imperative to continue this work to achieve our common goals. Most importantly, we need to acknowledge that our commitment to improve the state of the world is one we share with all people. Taking action should not rest solely on the shoulders of politicians. We saw an excellent example of this in 16-year old Greta Thunberg, a participant in the Annual Meeting. She did not wait for anyone to designate her a stakeholder and has inspired young people around to world as well as her fellow participants in Davos to join her cause for a more sustainable planet. We too should have the courage to take action. In this regard, the World Economic Forum stands ready to engage you with its platform for public-private cooperation and commitment to improving the state of the world. 3 World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2019World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 20194 Shaping the global agenda Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan used a special address to commit his country's G20 chairmanship to launch an agenda for global data governance. Abe said that the process, dubbed the Osaka track, would work under the auspices of the World Trade Organization. A group of 70-plus countries confirmed intentions to commence WTO negotiations on trade-related aspects of e-commerce following a ministerial meeting on the margins of the Annual Meeting on Friday 25 January. Shortly before, members of the Forum's business and civil society trade community issued a statement calling for a new digital trade deal that should be both ambitious and inclusive. The community urged governments to move forward with this agenda at the WTO to reduce costs and facilitate greater participation in the global digital economy. The leaders of Brazil, Colombia and Peru, along with the Foreign Minister of Canada, used a joint statement on Wednesday to offer their countries' backing to Juan Guaid\u00f3, leader of Venezuela's opposition-controlled parliament, after he had declared himself the country's interim president. A day earlier, President Mario Abdo Ben\u00edtez of Paraguay called on Guaid\u00f3 to take action. Mohammad Ashraf Ghani, President of Afghanistan, used his participation in the Annual Meeting to commit his country to democracy. Ghani used his address to remind other participants that Afghanistan has passed 390 new laws since 2015 and significantly increased the number of women in politics. Outcomes of the Annual Meeting The President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev and Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan used a meeting at the World Economic Forum to advance negotiations on the settlement of the Armenia-Azerbaijan Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The UK government announced a five-year plan to tackle the global threat of antimicrobial resistance. The plan envisages containing and controlling AMR worldwide by 2040. The Forum continued multistakeholder diplomacy dialogues aimed at advancing peace efforts on other key global fault lines, including the Western Balkans and Syria. The Forum also convened a public-private community of leaders for a Special Dialogue on Israeli-Palestinian relations. With the help of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed of Ethiopia, a diplomatic dialogue was held on the Horn of Africa. Discussions were also initiated on the Sahel, the Korean Peninsula, European-Russian relations and on a new development architecture for Africa-Europe engagement. Many of these conversations will be pursued and further advanced in our upcoming meeting at the Dead Sea, Jordan, on 6-7 April, which we have decided to turn into a global summit for peace and reconciliation. 5 World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2019New economy and society The Forum's Closing the Skills Gap Initiative, launched in 2017 with a target to reskill or upskill 10 million workers by 2020, announced that it has already secured pledges for training more than 17 million people globally, 6.4 million of whom have already been reskilled. The Forum also announced that the initiative is now supporting public-private partnerships aimed at promoting future skills in four countries: Argentina, India, Oman and South Africa. The Forum's Centre for Global Public Goods helped launch a $15 million project to start a formal electronic waste recycling industry in Nigeria. The amount of e-waste generated each year is set to more than double by 2050 and already is a major environmental hazard as well as a health risk for millions of people working and living close to waste sites. The scheme is backed by $2 million in funding from the Global Environment Facility, which will be leveraged by $13 million of financing from business. Peru joined the Forum's Tropical Forest Alliance to help the country achieve its target of reducing deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon. After Brazil, the country is home to the second largest area of Amazonian forest. Five Asian countries dump more plastic into oceans than anyone else combined. The Global Plastic Action Partnership (GPAP) announced its first national partnership in Indonesia to be launched 12 March. Viet Nam, the 2020 ASEAN Chair, has also joined GPAP , committing to a circular economy approach to tackle plastic pollution. Fourth Industrial Revolution The Forum's Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Network, established in 2017, announced it had grown to more than 100 businesses and governments, including five G7 nations. UNICEF, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the World Food Programme became the first international organizations to join. The Network also welcomed Colombia, Israel and the United Arab Emirates as Affiliated Centres for the Fourth Industrial Revolution - independent institutions committed to helping shape and pilot policies for emerging technology, such as artificial intelligence and blockchain. The Indian state of Andhra Pradesh announced it will adopt the Network's Advanced Drone Operator's Toolkit, a policy framework developed in collaboration with 10 civil aviation authorities, eight international governmental organizations The Forum also announced it was expanding its network of Closing the Gender Gap national taskforces to eight countries; Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, France, Panama and Peru. Our planet Voice for the Planet, a global campaign to build a movement for a new deal for nature and people was launched on Tuesday 22 January during a plenary with US Vice-President (1993- 2001) Al Gore, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand and Anand Mahindra, Chairman of Mahindra Group. The campaign garnered over 21,000 individual pledges within 48 hours. World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 20196 and 23 private companies, including the Governments of Rwanda and Switzerland. The move paves the way for Andhra Pradesh to scale up commercial drone activity. The Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Japan launched a new global initiative focused on accelerating the responsible and sustainable development of smart cities. A coalition of G20 cities will be formed to help ensure that global smart city efforts are built on a common set of human-centred principles and shared policy frameworks. A pilot project to protect airports and other critical infrastructure from cyberattacks was launched at the Annual Meeting. Willis Towers Watson will be the first to pilot the project. Public-private cooperation With financial backing from PACT and the Children's Investment Fund, and backed by 25 civil society organizations, the Forum launched a new initiative, Preparing Civil Society for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, aimed at helping civil society to meet the challenges presented by rapid technological change. A group of international businesses teamed to launch the Partnership for Global LGBTI Equality. Members of the Partnership agree to operationalize the UN's LGBTI Standards of Conduct worldwide across their business by 2020. The Partnership plans to enlist at least 50 other member companies by 2020. Members of the Forum's Platform for Good Digital Identity announced plans for supply chain pilots that bring together digital identity and digital payments to improve transparency, accelerate financial and digital inclusion of smallholder producers, and directly reward them for sustainable practices. The ID2020 Alliance launched a digital identity certification mark, to incentivize the design and use of digital identity solutions that adhere to the highest standards of privacy protection, user control and interoperability. The Forum teamed with the World Bank and the International Committee of the Red Cross to launch a High-Level Group on Humanitarian Investing to unlock private-sector capital for investment in fragile economies. Twenty-five global businesses announced they would work with Terracycle, a recycling specialist, to launch the Loop Alliance Initiative, a new concept of reusable packaging. The scheme, which will involve customers paying a refundable deposit for the durable packaging with no extra fee for collection, will recover the environmental costs of production after three or four uses. The Wellcome Trust committed $260 million over five years to improving basic understanding of depression and anxiety. The research will concentrate on psychological therapies that can be delivered early in life and at the onset of illness, as mental health problems typically start at a young age. 7 World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2019 A new public-private partnership was announced between the Government of Ghana and Novartis to improve and extend the lives of people with sickle cell disease in the country. Approximately 1,000 children are born with the disease in Africa every day and over half die of before their fifth birthday. The Global Youth Alliance was launched at the Annual Meeting by Facebook, Nestl\u00e9 and Nielsen to support skills for young people in emerging and developed countries. Valuable 500 is a new campaign aimed at releasing the social and economic potential of the 1.3 billion people around the world who live with a disability. The campaign will seek to sign up 500 global businesses to commit to putting disability on their board agendas in 2019. Rwanda became the first African country to join Alibaba's global trading platform, which is aimed at increasing e-commerce in emerging markets. Google and SAP announced Circular Economy 2030, a $400,000 competition to support entrepreneurs that promote sustainable consumption and production. Eight global universities committed to establish a new community, the Global Alliance of Universities on Climate (GAUC), with the goal of collaborating on promoting measures that support the UN conventions on climate change and the Sustainable Development Goals. They are: Australian National University; University of California, Berkeley; University of Cambridge; Imperial College London; London School of Economics and Political Science; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; University of Tokyo; and Tsinghua University. It is intended that more universities will be included in the coming years. 7 World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2019World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 20198 Opening Concert SoundShirt9 World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2019 Lee Sang-Yup in the session World in Transformation: Biotechnology Jair Bolsonaro, President of Brazil Angela Merkel, Federal Chancellor of Germany Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan Wang Qishan, Vice-President of the People's Republic of ChinaWorld Economic Forum Annual Meeting 201910 Global public opinion strongly in favour of openness and collaboration A global poll by the Forum finds that a majority of people in all regions believe cooperation between nations is either extremely or very important; that a large majority reject the notion that national improvement is a zero-sum game; and that most people feel that immigrants are mostly good for their adopted country. The research commissioned ahead of the Annual Meeting can be viewed as an endorsement by the public of the key principles of the multilateral system. It roundly debunks the negative notion of immigrants that has raced to the top of the news agenda across Europe, North America and elsewhere.The data was used in panel sessions and workshops at the Annual Meeting as a guide for participants as they discussed how to build an architecture for global governance that is capable of fostering the international collaboration necessary to solve the world's most critical challenges. One finding highlighted in the discussions is that, while most people still believe in the power of international cooperation, they share a much less positive view of their own country on social progress.

As well as providing insight into the global public's attitudes on opportunity and international relations, the survey also shines a light on other important matters of global importance in 2019, such as sustainability, climate change, and the role of technology in society. \"The combination of climate change, income inequality, technology and geopolitics pose an existential threat to humanity. What we see with this research is that, while the international community's capacity for concerted action appears constrained, the overwhelming desire of the global public is for leaders to find new ways to work together than will allow them to cooperate on these critical shared challenges we all face,\" said Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman at the World Economic Forum.

Sessions are organized by the below tracks: A global dialogue on geopolitics in a multiconceptual world to enable candid and constructive discussion on how to drive future cooperation along with a global dialogue on peace and reconciliation to catalyse large-scale, multistakeholder support for diplomatic efforts on key fault lines around the world. A global dialogue on the future of the economy to better reflect the structural changes inherent in the Fourth Industrial Revolution along with a global dialogue on financial and monetary systems to jointly shape our monetary and financial systems by not only leveraging new technologies but also achieving sustainable growth and long-term societal well-being. A global dialogue on industry systems that anticipates how the Fourth Industrial Revolution provides opportunities to substantially enhance the availability and delivery of products and services along with a global dialogue on technology policy to define the principles for new and emerging technologies to ensure that they are underpinned by a values- based framework. A global dialogue on risk resilience to promote systems thinking to radically improve our collective and integrated management of the key environmental systems upon which our societies and economies depend along with a global dialogue on cybersecurity to ensure that digital innovation and the technological backbone of the Fourth Industrial Revolution are both secure and trusted. A global dialogue on human capital to revisit the notion of work substantially changing and the relevance for talent, well-being and competitiveness along with a global dialogue on a new societal narrative to move away from consumption and materialism to a more humanistic focus. A global dialogue on institutional reform to rethink the global institutional frameworks that emerged in the 20th century and adapt them to ensure they are relevant for the new political, economic and social context along with a global dialogue on economic cooperation to create a new framework of rules and institutions integrating all aspects of global economic cooperation.World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 201914 Reinvigorating multilateralism As the most pressing challenges of our time are met by an increasingly fractured response, we may need our divided international system more than ever before. Geopolitical tensions are simmering across the globe, from the US-China trade war, to questions over Syria and Iran, and a political crisis unfolding in Venezuela. These are all playing out against a backdrop of slowing global growth and a rise in reactionary populism, and amid the mega trends of climate change, migration and digitization. Some of the world's leading thinkers and decision-makers convened at the Annual Meeting to discuss the myriad concerns under the theme, Globalization 4.0: Shaping a Global Architecture in the Age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. As participants grappled with big questions of how to tackle manifestations of rust belt discontent, protracted conflict in the world's most fragile states, or the geopolitical implications of an energy transition, the discussions were underscored by an understanding that the geopolitical power dynamic is in a state of momentous and tumultuous flux. \"We no longer live in a bipolar or unipolar world, but we are not yet in a multipolar world,\" said Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, referring to the decline in American primacy and a rising China. \"We are in a kind of chaotic situation of transition.\" The relationship between the world's most important powers, the United States, Russia and China, he noted, has never been so dysfunctional and that is true as much for the economy as it is for the UN Security Council. The impact of these oscillating power shifts is already being felt in global markets, with the trade war between the US and China, and the perceived volatility of the US administration and its foreign policy, dominating the geopolitical agenda at the Annual Meeting. The fallout from the trade war - in the past year the US and China have imposed tariffs of $250 billion and $100 billion on each other's goods respectively - is reverberating around the globe and coalescing powerfully in Asia. Geopolitics in a multiconceptual world, peace and reconciliation Calling for the trade dispute to be \"settled as quickly as possible because the uncertainty is killing us\", Kishore Mahbubani, Professor in the Practice of Policy, National University of Singapore, argued that US geopolitical power plays appear to be setting it up for a future where it is less engaged in the world's most dynamic region. \"If you are thinking strategically in the US, they should be pushing for greater trade engagement with Asia because that will determine the balance of influence 10 years from now,\" he said. Conversely, as China forges ahead with its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative, involving an estimated $1.5 trillion in Chinese investment in infrastructure across the region, the US position appears more and more withdrawn. Running tandem to the ensuing trade war is a slowing Chinese economy, contributing to a gloomier economic outlook in 2019, the effects of which will also be felt in the global energy market and in the geopolitics of supply and demand.15 World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2019 The Duke of Cambridge in conversation with Sir David Attenborough, discussing his upcoming series Our Planet, urgent environmental challenges, and his advice to the next generation of global leaders \"When we talk about the global economic slowdown, one country is frequently cited and that is China, and we all know that Chinese economic growth might be the slowest in the last three decades,\" said Fatih Birol, Executive Director of the International Energy Agency. \"Let's not forget that in the past 10 years China was responsible for more than 50% of the global oil demand growth. If the Chinese economy slows, there will be implications.\" Leaving aside projections vis-\u00e0-vis oil sanctions and Iran, there are also huge geopolitical implications of an energy transition on the horizon. \"Think about how much geopolitical reordering happened just on account of the US shale boom,\" said Professor Meghan O'Sullivan, Jeane Kirkpatrick Professor of the Practice of International Affairs and Director, Geopolitics of Energy Project, Harvard University, when considering the impacts of nations fulfilling their carbon emission targets. \"And imagine a complete change in the global energy mix, how much that is The best video answers are featured on https://www.weforum.org/globalization4Globalization 4.0: Can you be a patriot and a global citizen? Today's global risks need global solutions. We've identified six key questions we must address to make Globalization 4.0 work for all. Our ability to react to those in need is widening and we won't possibly manage to cope and cover the gap with traditional means. Peter Maurer, President, International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), GenevaWorld Economic Forum Annual Meeting 201916 going to impact overall political relationships and how much it is going to change the nature of the threats, the possibility for alleviating energy poverty, and the politics of climate change on the other hand.\" These changes come at a time when the international system, undermined by a rise in emboldened unilateralism and illiberal democracy, is weaker and more divided that any time since the Second World War. Deliberating on solutions, political and business leaders strongly urged a reinvigorated multilateral system as a panacea to an increasingly volatile world. In a special address, Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany, said: \"Multilateralism is not all that easy, but I have to think of the possible alternatives. We have populist and nationalist challenges and we have to stand up against them.\" She added: \"Commitment to multilateralism is essential and a precondition for shaping tomorrow. Anything else will lead us into destruction.\" She acknowledged that existing international institutions are far from perfect but said they should be adapted and remodelled, rather than upended and replaced anew. As the Fourth Industrial Revolution ushers in an era of rapid technological change, international institutions must modernize to better reflect and address new realities, such as formulating rules on global e-commerce, or the weaponization of artificial intelligence (AI). The tremendous progress international institutions have made in tackling some of the world's most crucial issues offer strong support for Merkel's aspirations. Take, for example, the big gains in poverty reduction. In 1981, some 41% of the global population lived in extreme poverty, while today that figure is less than 10%. Yet experts predict that in a weaker international political system, one marked by climate change and protracted conflicts in countries such as Syria, Yemen and South Sudan, humanitarian distress is likely to be compounded in the next few years. In the same way that some international economic and political institutions will be rendered obsolete if they don't adapt, the systems designed to deliver peace and security also warrant critical revision. David Miliband, President of the International Rescue Committee, argued that a conflation of \"humanitarian\" with \"emergency\" has led to a glaringly ineffective reliance on short-term strategies to address long-term crises. Only 2% of the global humanitarian budget currently goes to education, a state he described as \"not just immoral, but a strategic dereliction of duty\". Peter Maurer, President of the International Committee of the Red Cross, encapsulated the problem this way: \"The recognition is pretty big that something is wrong in terms of the concept and approach. Our ability to react to those in need is widening and we won't possibly manage to cope and cover the gap with the traditional means.\" Maurer was reflecting on the state of the humanitarian sector, but his point strikes at the heart of the geopolitical challenge too - that the most crucial challenges of our time, current trade fractures and simmering conflicts, will not be solved by a business-as-usual approach. Geopolitics in a multiconceptual world, peace and reconciliation Majid Jafar in the session The Great Energy Race17 World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2019Geopolitics in a multiconceptual world, peace and reconciliation Forum Agenda Why businesses are nothing without strong human rights The Forum Agenda attracts more than 4 million readers every month. The following article is among the most read blogs on the theme of Globalization 4.0. Let's start with a seemingly unconventional proposition: civil society and business share the same space and, therefore, should share an interest in defending what unites them. How controversial is that proposition, really? This \"shared space\" is anchored in accountable governance. Civil society actors and companies both depend on the same legal and institutional frameworks that define the shared space to operate. Civil society cannot flourish, and business will struggle to thrive, without the rules and standards that hold public and private powers accountable. Civic freedoms - freedoms of expression, association, information and assembly - allow citizens to expose abuses related to corruption, workplace safety, public health, toxic pollution and gender discrimination. These rights support stable, predictable legal and regulatory environments. At the same time, they enable the free flow of information, investment and entrepreneurial innovation. When these civic freedoms are undermined, business and civil society alike are subject to the law of the jungle instead of the rule of law.

Despite the Paris Agreement, the planet is on track to warm by 3\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. According to the World Bank, this will wipe out 25% of global GDP and cause immeasurable human suffering. Meanwhile, despite a tripling of global GDP since the 1990s, inequality has increased. The pay gap ratio between a chief executive officer and a typical worker in 1978 was 30:1. Today, it's over 300:1. \"Extreme inequality is really out of control,\" said Winnie Byanyima, Executive Director of Oxfam International. For 800 million people, it means living in extreme poverty - and that number is rising in sub-Saharan Africa. In the face of such glaring inequalities and reactionary populism, the leaders of Spain and Italy told participants that they are committed to driving transformative economic change. \"Open global markets, free movement of capital and technological revolution did generate a large pay-off as promised, but just for the few,\" noted Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. Describing the current social contract as \"violated,\" Conte championed a new vision he calls \"new humanism\". He said more robust economic and social fixes and a fairer set of rules are required to improve opportunities and working conditions for ordinary people. He pointed to the new Italian government's flexible retirement age and greater income support for poor families. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez agreed that the growing wealth gap in Europe and other parts of the world is tearing the fabric of society. Reactionary populism and rising inequality, he argued, are the results of the weakness of global capitalism that have yet to be addressed and are not just the problem of one country but of liberal democracy itself. \"We must change now that we have some degree of freedom to do so, and we must do this mindful of the fact that the economy is not self-serving but serves the people,\" he said. The Spanish leader called for urgent and innovative thinking to address the challenges ahead, from discussion of universal wages to how best harness Pressing challenges demand collaborative rule-making The shockwaves of populism have been reverberating around the world. Are global institutional frameworks still relevant and how can we adapt them to be fit for purpose in the new political, social and economic context?Institutional reform and economic cooperation21 World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2019 Session Setting Rules for the AI Race rapid technological change in data, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to improve government services. The global institutions responsible for framing rules in trade, finance and public goods, set up over 70 years ago, now seem ill-suited to tackling today's pressing tasks. The creaking, old-school architecture of multilateral government- to-government structures is typified by the World Trade Organization (WTO), which has failed to complete a major agreement in a quarter century, or the United Nations Security Council, which has failed to prevent over 400,000 deaths during Syria's seven-year civil war. A radical rethink of international and regional institutions is needed to ensure that globalization's latest incarnation delivers sustainable, human-centred development. The governance of global trade has also been badly affected by recent geopolitical transformations. But while the WTO stagnates, regional trade agreements have mushroomed, including those between US-Mexico-Canada, Institutional reform and economic cooperation The best video answers are featured on https://www.weforum.org/globalization4Globalization 4.0: How do we get countries working together better? Today's global risks need global solutions. We've identified six key questions we must address to make Globalization 4.0 work for all. We need to address the societal well-being of our nation, not just the economic well-being. Jacinda Ardern, Prime Minister of New ZealandWorld Economic Forum Annual Meeting 201922 EU-Canada and EU-Japan. In Africa, the Continental Free Trade Area aims to integrate a market of 1.2 billion people while driving greater digital connectivity and job security. Cyril Ramaphosa, President of South Africa, said: \"This could well be the great industrialization moment for the continent.\" Along with President Paul Kagame of Rwanda, the two presidents addressed the issue of the African Continental Free Trade Area, launched in 2018, which aims to significantly raise the current low levels of intra-African trade. Kagame, as Chair of the African Union in 2018, has been a key driver of the initiative, which he called the beginning of a new era for trade and investment in Africa. The fact that 44 of Africa's nations signed the agreement at its launch and others have come on board since then shows the strong political will behind the initiative, Kagame said. Integration will eventually create a market of 1.2 billion people and pull together the continent's countries, many of which are too small to compete effectively alone, he said. There is a new appetite among groups of countries spanning different regions to align their trade policies within specific economic sectors - so-called \"plurilateral\" agreements. This approach is helping update global rulebooks for e-commerce, fisheries, investment facilitation and services. In a session on digital emerging markets, Jack Ma, the Executive Chairman of Alibaba, noted that many countries provide incentives and benefits for large companies to participate in global trade but small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) often get left behind. \"We think there should be free trade zones for small businesses,\" he said. He cited the Alibaba-led Electronic Trade Platform as a means to level the playing field for young people and SMEs to give them direct access to global markets. The financial crisis a decade ago inspired some important improvements in the architecture of financial stability. However, there is scope to strengthen it in several areas. We must find ways to finance the $1 trillion of new money needed every year for the development and climate-related infrastructure envisaged in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement. A G20 task force is leading a coordinated shift in multilateral development bank business models to transform them from direct lenders to risk-mitigators of private investment. This game-changing approach represents the best chance for funding the SDGs. Nowhere is the challenge to the world's existing cooperative architecture more pressing than with respect to climate change. The crucial execution of the Paris Agreement's \"nationally determined contributions\" is faltering. Yet no effective multilateral structures exist to guarantee that countries will hit their targets. The celebrated nature documentarian Sir David Attenborough made an impassioned plea to participants at the Annual Meeting to care for the natural world. He said that even though the ready accessibility of nature programmes and the ability of filmmakers to reach the remotest corners of the world have made it easier for people to learn about nature, humanity's connectedness with the natural world is more tenuous than ever. \"The majority of people are out of touch to some degree with the richness of the natural world.\" The good news is that a growing number of cities, provincial states, companies and civil society organizations are setting their own emissions reduction targets. There is optimism this could generate a snowball effect of political, industry and citizen peer pressure and benchmarking. There is no global institution for technology governance, yet the stakes of getting governance wrong are immeasurably high. Artificial intelligence (AI) could generate an estimated Session on Artificial Intelligence: Localized Strategies for Global TechnologiesInstitutional reform and economic cooperation23 World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2019$15 trillion in economic value by 2030 - yet just nine companies in the United States and China control its future. Consequently, AI could easily increase inequality. Governments can learn from software development and adopt an open-source approach to creating regulation in partnership with the private sector. Since the global financial crash, mistrust of corporations has deepened. Societies across the world resent how international companies dodge domestic taxation with impunity and harvest the benefits of gathering other people's data while regulators scramble to keep up. According to Byanyima, $170 billion a year is siphoned off into tax havens. In the new economy, company directors have a heightened fiduciary duty to ensure their firms deliver long-term value and not just short-term returns. The holy cow of maximizing shareholder value needs to give way to maximizing stakeholder value, through a reinvestment of profits into R&D and paying taxes in the jurisdictions where profits are generated. The OECD has created an Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profits Shifting (BEPS) that equips governments with the instruments required to tax companies more effectively. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations reaffirmed the principle of multilateralism as the only way to deal with global problems. Rather than vilifying those who disagree with us and calling them populists, we need to understand why they disagree with us, he said. Making Technology Governance WorkParticipants during the Session \"What Should Globalization 4.0 Look Like?\"Institutional reform and economic cooperationWorld Economic Forum Annual Meeting 201924 Forum Agenda Globalization 4.0 - what does it mean? The Forum Agenda attracts more than 4 million readers every month. The following article is among the most read blogs on the theme of Globalization 4.0. After World War 2, the international community came together to build a shared future. Now, it must do so again. Owing to the slow and uneven recovery in the decade since the global financial crisis, a substantial part of society has become disaffected and embittered, not only with politics and politicians but also with globalization and the entire economic system it underpins. In an era of widespread insecurity and frustration, populism has become increasingly attractive as an alternative to the status quo. But populist discourse eludes - and often confounds - the substantive distinctions between two concepts: globalization and globalism. Globalization is a phenomenon driven by technology and the movement of ideas, people and goods. Globalism is an ideology that prioritizes the neo-liberal global order over national interests. Nobody can deny that we are living in a globalized world. But whether all of our policies should be \"globalist\" is highly debatable. After all, this moment of crisis has raised important questions about our global- governance architecture. With more and more voters demanding to \"take back control\" from \"global forces\", the challenge is to restore sovereignty in a world that requires cooperation. Rather than closing off economies through protectionism and nationalist politics, we must forge a new social compact between citizens and their leaders, so that everyone feels secure enough at home to remain open to the world at large. Failing that, the ongoing disintegration of our social fabric could ultimately lead to the collapse of democracy.

The United States and Europe show steady - if plateauing - growth. China's growth is expected to continue at 6% or more for 2019. And regulations since the 2008 financial crisis have improved the stability and capitalization of large banks around the world. Indeed, if the biggest threats to the global economy resembled those that caused the last crisis, then complacency might be in order. Yet economic inequality continues to rise. Extreme climate events threaten every region around the world. And geopolitical challenges - from Brexit to the US-China trade dispute - suggest that recent gains could be fragile. The major question for the future of the economy and financial systems is: have we created the right financial infrastructure to weather the next crisis and foster a new generation of more inclusive globalization? The answer, according to many experts, is: no. One challenge involves understanding the tectonic changes that have taken place within the financial industry in recent years, from the rise of \"fintech\" to the growth of the non- banking financial sector. A second issue involves identifying the biggest risks that loom on the economic horizon. Technology has changed the global economy by creating both opportunities and challenges for globalization 4.0. In many cases, innovation has lowered transaction costs, democratized investing and offered economic opportunities to new communities. Yet, technology has also exposed vulnerabilities to international financial systems. \"Fintech\" - technology for providing banking services, such as electronic payment and peer-to-peer lending - has disrupted business as usual in the financial services industry. In China, large technological platforms such as Alibaba and Tencent have gained hundreds of millions of users by providing electronic payment services for large portions of China's population that lacked access to traditional banking.How to tackle the biggest risks on the financial horizon Persistent economic inequality is calling into question the financial infrastructure that was put in place after the global financial crash of 2008. What more can be done to avert a new crisis?Future of the economy and financial and monetary systems27 World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2019 Axel P. Lehmann in the session World in Transformation Financial and Monetary Systems Developed markets such as the United States and Europe have seen smaller- scale examples of fintech innovation, but, in all cases, the technologies have raised questions about what and when to regulate. Too much regulation could stifle innovation that increases efficiency of financial systems and benefits underserved populations. Too little could leave both users and markets vulnerable. One major technological innovation, crypto-currencies, saw marked declines in 2018. Even though crypto-assets are unlikely to displace established currencies, experts agree that the technology underlying bitcoin, Ethereum and others could prove useful in improving resilience and security for financial services. Several central banks are already testing small-scale uses of distributed ledger technology. Another major change in global investing involves the rise of \"passive\" management, or index investing, over more traditional, active investing vehicles. Passive funds now account for 44% of total assets under management in equity funds, and concentration of ownership has moved to a handful of Future of the economy and financial and monetary systems We need to debunk the myth that you need first to achieve higher growth before you reduce inequality.

Today's global risks need global solutions. We've identified six key questions we must address to make Globalization 4.0 work for all.World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 201928 US-based firms, such as Vanguard and BlackRock. How will the concentration of wealth in these services change the financial industry? One major question involves liquidity: what would happen if an external shock prompted a major market sell-off? In December 2018, investors got a preview of the volatility that could ensue, as markets plunged and set off jitters worldwide. Following the 2008 crisis, regulators focused intently on reforming banks to ensure that problems with a single institution would not trigger systemic shocks. It is unclear whether the \"non-bank\" financial sector now poses such risks and, if so, what regulation should ensue. Another change facing global businesses involves mounting pressures from consumers, employees and investors to embrace long-term strategies of value creation. Decades ago, corporate leaders tended to claim that \"the business of business is business.\" By contrast, today's firms need a broader licence to operate than simply generating profits for shareholders. \"Every company at Davos knows that they're one tweet away from a social disaster,\" said Ngaire Woods, Dean of the Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford. In a world where social media can fell a Fortune 500 company, businesses have increasingly sought to demonstrate their social purpose and long-term values. Nonetheless, the pressure to deliver short-term profits persists. How can executives balance the need to demonstrate long-term social impact while many investors press for ever- increasing quarterly earnings? Changing stakeholder discourse and quantifying social impacts could give executives more tools to focus investors' attention on their long-term goals. Family businesses could also offer models for long-term value creation. Family-owned businesses, which account for roughly two-thirds of all businesses worldwide, tend to have higher public-trust rankings and more latitude to focus on long-term strategies than their publicly owned counterparts. Better metrics could also help companies demonstrate their corporate stewardship and encourage investors to broaden the terms by which they evaluate companies. However, standards for environmental, social and governance (ESG) data are inconsistent and confusing. One company reported receiving 55 ESG surveys, and the 12 major rating agencies show a near-zero correlation in their corporate ratings. The result is a fractured landscape offering little clarity for investors, executives, employees or consumers. As the global economy adapts to these new pressures and technologies, one of the biggest questions is whether today's The Big Picture on Women in the Workforcefinancial and monetary systems are resilient enough to withstand the shocks that could be ahead. Cybersecurity is a major focus for bankers and regulators alike. Is the financial system sturdy enough to handle outages of core services or major institutions? Technologies such as cloud computing could help distribute risks and ensure continued operation of critical financial services. However, executives have been hesitant to experiment with migrating technology for core functions or consumer data, given the risks. Another major challenge facing the global financial system involves the growing narrative of de-globalization. Public pushback to globalization threatens to curtail the options available to policy-makers in responding to future shocks. For example, during the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve had the flexibility to support US banks and provide liquidity to other central banks. Political pressure could limit the range of options available to future economic policy-makers.Future of the economy and financial and monetary systems29 World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2019 Matt Hancock and Jay Flatley in the session What If: Everyone Had Their Genome Sequenced at Birth?Designs for users with physical restrictions on exhibit in the Congress CentreGeopolitical risks, such as the US-China trade dispute, could also undermine the economic recovery of the last decade. Ten years ago, many companies looked to China as the \"factory of the world.\" Today, rising domestic consumption now constitutes 80% of China's GDP, and in 2018, the growth of imports exceeded that of exports. \"China is becoming the market of the world,\" said Song Zhiping, Chairman of the Board, China National Building Material Group Corporation. Trade barriers would complicate US companies' access to Chinese markets and could impair growth in China as well. The cascading effects would be tremendous. For example, commodity- dependent countries rely on China to purchase their exports, and falling commodity prices would cause declines in a wide range of markets. Economic experts also worry about cascading effects of geopolitical issues such as Brexit. Ensuring that the global economic system is strong enough to withstand rising populism or a trade war will require strong multilateral institutions and political commitments to cooperate. But even with such systems and relationship in place, one of the biggest risks facing economies around the world involves the growing threats associated with climate change.Future of the economy and financial and monetary systemsWorld Economic Forum Annual Meeting 201930 Forum Agenda Four ways we can fix economics in 2019 The Forum Agenda attracts more than 4 million readers every month. The following article is among the most read blogs on the theme of Globalization 4.0. \"It was a chance... for us to send pain the other way. And we took it.\" A Brexiteer's statement in the wake of the referendum in 2016 captures the frustrations felt by many under the twin forces of globalization and the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Never has the economy changed so quickly, nor with such glaring visibility of the gap between the winners and those left behind. The backlash is hardly surprising. Although many advanced economies have reaped enormous benefits from globalization and technological advances in recent decades, they have also experienced a hollowing out of the middle class; growing market concentration within many sectors which means fewer employers and less power for workers; as well as a decoupling between productivity growth and wage increases. In many emerging markets, the picture is different. People feel more positive about digital technology when it helps to level the playing field by providing access to information, markets, services and employment, allowing entrepreneurs to thrive. Yet, as the promise of the manufacturing-led development model of the past fades, it is unclear what will replace it. A newly prosperous middle class is starting to worry whether a path to success will be open to their children.

Corollary to that, at least in most instances, is that resilience to risk moves in just the opposite direction - the more complex and intertwined a set of systems, the less resilient any given system becomes. The direction of threat becomes more difficult to identify and the knock-on effects become more difficult to calculate. And yet on one level, all of our systems - financial, infrastructural, technological, political, social - share an irreducible dependence on the one, fundamental natural system: the earth itself. Increasingly, we recognize the truth that the earth is a single holistic system, comprising interdependent ecosystems, and that the health of any one of them is inextricably tied to the health of the others and of the whole. Systems of humankind's devising are ultimately irrelevant to the earth. This era, that some have accurately termed the Anthropocene, could well just pass.

Today's global risks need global solutions. We've identified six key questions we must address to make Globalization 4.0 work for all.unspeakable disasters befall humanity. The fragility of our systems will be laid bare as the collapse of one brings down many others. But the earth will be fine, whatever the sad fate of humanity. The resilience of our systems will never match that of our planet. We as a species may be pardoned for not sharing our home's indifference to our fate and that of our systems. We are undeserving of pardon, however, for our failure thus far to act on what we know to be true: that our poor stewardship of the environment gravely imperils our civilization and that the single greatest systemic risk is one of our own making. We have a gathering awareness of the interconnectedness of our planet's systems. We know that what we mine or pump from beneath the earth's surface, what we cut down in its forests, what we plant and graze, harvest and slaughter, what we burn and spew into the air, what we pull from the oceans and what we dump back into them - all of it impacts, directly or indirectly, what happens in each piece. The simple mandate to preserve that most fundamental system has now assumed unprecedented urgency. And yet there is little sign that we're ready to get on track to reach even the modest Paris goals of passing peak carbon within the next two years, halving global carbon emissions by 2030, and keeping to within 2\u00b0C of pre-industrial levels. The politics of the moment are just not conducive to taking the more extreme measures our plight demands. The tide of populism, often entwined with nativist and nationalist movements, has not yet begun to ebb. The worsening bilateral relationship between the incumbent superpower and the newly rising one threatens to foreclose - at least for now - the possibility for badly needed cooperation between the two on climate issues. In the absence of support from the present US administration, many leaders of smaller states, as well as subnational actors like governors and mayors, are taking the initiative as well as taking up some of the slack. But it's far from enough. Climate change now poses system risk across a broad swathe of critical systems. Risks to the food system are among the most menacing. While for decades humanity seemed to be winning the struggle for food security, in recent years the outlook has turned grim: the famine declared by the United Nations in Somalia in 2011 was the century's first, but in 2017, the regions of four nations - Yemen, Somalia, South Sudan, and Nigeria - were either at or past the brink of famine. War and famine, as ever, ride side by side, the one often the cause of the other. But it works the other way, too. Climate change puts extreme pressure on food World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 201936 systems by both drought and flood. In the case of the former, scarce water and the food crops requiring it become worth fighting for and dying over. The mutual impact of our oceans and our atmospheric climate are increasingly well-understood, and what we know now is grim. As with our melting permafrost zones, our warming oceans lose their capacity to sequester carbon, exacerbating atmospheric warming in a dangerous spiral. Warmer oceans are more energetic oceans, and one dangerous manifestation of that surging oceanic energy is the conspicuous increase in severe weather systems - more powerful storms carrying more water and packing higher winds. Oceans are also a major source of food, on which hundreds of millions of people depend for protein. As waters warm, they acidify and their oxygen levels decrease. Fish - their metabolisms already increased by their warmer environs - require not less but more oxygen, and so they abandon traditional fishing grounds for cooler, more oxygenated waters. Industrial fishing fleets, already decimating fish stocks by pulling the human weight of China from the oceans every year, may be able to follow what fish remain to the distant waters they flee to. But not so the local fishermen of the African coasts, who choose the perils of migration or of piracy over slow, inexorable starvation. The Earth may be ultimately indifferent to humanity's fate, but we cannot be - neither in the long term nor in the short term. While it is encouraging to see how action that we take to mitigate climate change will bring growth, open up new entrepreneurial opportunities, and create, by some estimates, as many as 24 million jobs, this is cold comfort to those whose livelihoods will be upended in the short run. The University of California, Berkeley sociologist Arlie Russel Hochschild's book Strangers in their Own Land explored the paradoxical hostility to environmental agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency felt by direct victims of environmental disasters in the poor parishes of Louisiana, in the American South. Hochschild's work makes clear that the resistance environmentalists encounter from populists is attributable, at least in part, to a certain callousness and condescension on the part of elites and a failure to take seriously enough the concerns of those who fear the economic disruption of a transition away from fossil fuels. Even as we seek to mitigate climate change, we must work to mitigate the economic blow on people whose livelihoods are intimately tied to coal and other fossil fuels. The growing consensus is that strict taxes on carbon, coupled perhaps with a market for carbon credits, is the only feasible way to reduce emissions in the short term. Meanwhile, to continue as a species, we need to wean ourselves off meat, and especially beef. New feed additives that reduce bovine methane emissions will help, but the fact remains that our current diet is unsustainable. Troels Oerting Jorgensen briefs participants in the Centre for Cybersecurity: Cybersecurity Outlook 2019Continuing our pursuit of carbon sequestration technologies is well and good, but implementation at any scale that would make a dent is still decades away and our clock is running down fast. In the end, the resilience of our own artificial systems may rest on our wisely and respectfully leveraging our planet's own natural resilience. Nature has evolved a fine-tuned and robust ability to heal, and what's become clear to experts from atmospheric scientists to zoologists is that were humanity simply able to give enough of the planet back - to protect more forests, from the taiga to the tropical rainforests, to cordon off wetlands and coastal ecosystems, to ban industrial fishing fleets from large swaths of the oceans - the earth would bounce back quickly. Like any proposed solution, this would take immense political will. Of all our man-made systems, our social and political ones are perhaps the most complex, and worryingly, our least resilient.Cybersecurity and risk resilience37 World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2019 Winnie Byanyima in the session A 'Fourth Social Revolution'? Designing Healthier Cities for People and Planet with the National University of SingaporeBuilding trust and security in cyberspace The modern internet is the example par excellence of a system whose explosive growth, complexity, unquestionable utility and increasing centrality to our lives has grown in tandem with the corresponding problems it presents: it is uncontrollable, highly vulnerable and intimately connected to any number of other systems, saddling all other systems from banking to power grids with its same vulnerabilities. As the Fourth Industrial Revolution unfolds with the internet indisputably at its core, the internet's indispensability will be matched in scale by a dangerously high-risk profile. The annual shortfall of trained cybersecurity workers to tackle cybercrime is now an estimated 3.5 million and, for the owners of the 20-odd billion networked devices in the world, there's far too much at stake to wait for long-term solutions. For now, major internet companies must step up their game and serve as the first and strongest line of defence when it comes to privacy and security. And as events of recent years have made abundantly clear, they need to exercise far greater vigilance in preventing the kind of attacks that target voting systems and the democratic process itself. The Paris Call of 12 November 2018 for Trust and Security in Cyberspace is an important initiative that has managed to rally 28 European Union members, many of the democratic states of East and South-East Asia, and all but one member of NATO. Numerous consumer-facing internet companies and cybersecurity providers have joined in, too. Notably absent is representation from the world's largest country by internet users: China. In this multipolar and multiconceptual world, is it enough to gather only states committed to one idea of internet governance? It may be tempting to want to put China on the other side of the fence. But a wiser approach might be working together on shared issues like transnational cybercrime and building a working relationship that may, as the Paris Call intends, build both trust and security in cyberspace.Cybersecurity and risk resilienceWorld Economic Forum Annual Meeting 201938 Forum Agenda Privacy is a human right - we need a GDPR for the world The Forum Agenda attracts more than 4 million readers every month.

Satya Nadella, who has been shifting Microsoft's focus to cloud computing, said he would welcome clearer regulations as every company and industry grappled with the data age. In a talk at Davos, he praised GDPR , the European regulation on data protection and privacy that came into force last year. \"My own point of view is that it's a fantastic start in treating privacy as a human right. I hope that in the United States we do something similar, and that the world converges on a common standard.\" The default position had to be that people owned their own data, he said. Privacy is just one controversial area for tech companies. Nadella also addressed the growing field of facial recognition.

But this time people will want to see evidence that it is truly sustainable and for the larger social good. Almost no industry is untouched by automation and data analytics, and businesses across sectors are learning that they must disrupt or get disrupted. Blockchain in banking, robotics in manufacturing, autonomous vehicles in transport, precision medicine in healthcare and personalization in consumer goods are just some technological applications that are transforming entire industries, and at a breathtaking pace and scale. But with the opportunities of the Fourth Industrial Revolution come a range of societal concerns, chief among which are data privacy and security, environmental degradation, market concentration that threatens to perpetuate existing inequities, and the challenge of skilling and reskilling people. To what extent Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies solve these problems will depend largely on national policies and industry-led strategies. Thanks to the spread of information and communication technologies, consumers are closely scrutinizing and increasingly vocal about businesses' sociopolitical and environmental footprints, putting pressure on governments to regulate to control or incentivize for the larger social good. Regulators must strike a balance between two competing values: profitability and inequality. While technology can be used to increase profits, it must not be allowed to underpin failing current systems, said Hilary Cottam, Author and Entrepreneur, Centre for the Fourth Social Revolution. \"We can use tech to design new systems that address the challenges we face. But we need a revolution,\" she added.

New models must be found for creating regulations because governments often cannot keep up with the evolution of technology. The World Economic Forum's Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, for instance, brings together leaders from the public and private sectors, academia, research organizations and civil society. From its headquarters in San Francisco and an expanding network of Centres in China, India and Japan, leaders from across the world develop and test policy approaches to responsible governance of technology. As an example of the Centre's work, the Government of Singapore recently brought out a model framework for the governance of artificial intelligence (AI). The framework aims to understand the risks posed, anticipate the transition challenges for the nature of work and for business models, and proactively take steps to prepare the economy for Globalization 4.0.

Today's global risks need global solutions. We've identified six key questions we must address to make Globalization 4.0 work for all.World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 201942 It contains several elements that could be instructive for similar efforts on other technologies and in other jurisdictions - a council on ethical use of AI and data, chaired by a former attorney-general, and including a group of industry representatives and senior government officials; a national AI programme that aims to generate 100 use cases, each focused on solving a real problem; and a model governance framework, designed collaboratively and applicable voluntarily, to gather experience and evidence to eventually inform a regulatory or policy stance. Under a different aegis, but also underlining the cross-border nature of technological transformation and the need for a global response, the state government of Andhra Pradesh in India released an Advanced Drone Operators Toolkit at the Annual Meeting. This first-user manual for governments looking to roll out socially impactful, advanced drone operations aims to help governments overcome the hurdles of implementing drone regulations and accelerate access to airspace, while maintaining safety and security. It also includes specific steps for governments interested in implementing similar programmes. Indeed, since the technological changes and the challenges they pose are not isolated to a particular country, industry or issue, they present a universal governance challenge and create a significant opportunity for international relations. By providing a shared imperative at a time of emerging and deepening divisions in the international community, cooperation among countries and other stakeholders could spill over positively into other areas of international relations. Standard-setting is a classic example of international cooperation driven by technological change, and there is an array of areas calling out for clarity on data collection and interoperability standards, such as healthcare and the internet of things, where the absence of standard data protocols threatens to make vast amounts of data practically unusable. At the same time, the business community must step up and play a leading part in ensuring a \"Fourth Social Revolution\", said Subramanian Rangan, The Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Court Endowed Chair in Societal Progress at INSEAD. \"They must ask themselves big questions - how do we handle human capital, who owns data, what do we want artificial intelligence to do?\" He added: \"Even as you deepen cyber capital, you must deepen your moral capital.\" Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies face a \"huge inclusion problem\", said Ginni Rometty, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, of IBM, because \"a large part of society does not feel it will be good for their future; they feel disenfranchised.\" Technology is moving faster in time than people can skill and reskill. It is imperative that technological advancement be accompanied by efforts to overcome the trust crisis and the skills crisis, a problem that government cannot solve alone. Businesses must do things differently, for instance, by hiring for skills not diplomas or degrees, and creating and accepting new career pathways that may not include college or tertiary education and have respect for the \"new collar\" jobs thus created. Sarah Al Amiri, Minister of State for Advanced Sciences of the United Arab Emirates, emphasized that it is vital to educate people at an early age. With the wealth of information available today, there is a danger to what people might learn when they cannot discern information that is valid and peer- reviewed, because nowadays information can be easily manipulated. She also argued that good storytelling is needed as the scientific community is good at using jargon. \"Their language is not understood by the public,\" she said. The Factory of the FutureIndustry systems and technology policy43 World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2019What will doctors do when robots run hospitals? Globally, healthcare is transforming from a hospital and treatment-based system to a community and care-based one, with greater emphasis on prevention than crisis response. The application of technologies such as data analytics, mobile telephony, wearable sensors and internet of things, genome sequencing and precision medicine is making healthcare a comprehensive system of prevention, maintenance and treatment, empowering individuals to make the right decisions to live healthier lives. Looking ahead into a future of connected wearables, patients have to be prepared to accept care within their homes and families, and guidelines must be devised and implemented for handling diseases and medical conditions in home-based care settings. And a diverse range of care-related jobs are emerging, for which people must be trained and certified. In developing countries, newer models for providing solutions at low cost and at scale are emerging, such as \"e-ICUs\" in rural and remote settings. Indian hospitals are offering tele- medicine and tele-radiology solutions around the world, at scale. And with mobile phones becoming ubiquitous, their high computing and imaging power could soon be used to transform them into monitoring and diagnostic instruments, making them a disruptor that could move us to the future of medicine. As robots take over more functions, the role of humans in future healthcare systems must evolve - it is time to train doctors and nurses differently, and to choose them for empathy.

According to one estimate, 75 million jobs will be lost to machinery, but 133 million new roles are predicted to be created, leading to an overall surplus, even as robots move into traditional \"human\" roles of managing and advising, reasoning and decision- making. Melonee Wise, Chief Executive Officer of Fetch Robotics, said: \"This is the goal - robots as colleagues, not competitors, and robots working with people, not in place of them.\" It is not only automation which will lead to a recalibration of the labour market but also the changing nature of work itself. By 2022, 60% of workers are likely to have more than one employer. A rising number of freelancers has given rise to the so-called \"gig economy\", with workers taking on flexible stints for different reasons: 56% in one survey said it best meets current needs/goals, with 34% responding it was hard to find permanent work. The network of internet-mediated, on-demand job platforms allows new generations of workers to shape their own schedules but also creates regulation challenges including whether to treat companies such as Uber as traditional employers that should provide benefits and paid holiday leave, and how to ensure that worker income is taxed. A key question in preparation for Globalization 4.0 is: what will work look like in the future? It is the job of the education sector - and of training programmes within companies - to predict and build a new skills architecture to equip future and current workers for the next generation of jobs. To achieve this, universities and schools can first aim to build capacity and move away from rigid curricula, while vocational programmes can standardize certification to improve the portability of skills when workers need or choose to retrain. Governments can also step in by providing tax preferential funds to Human capital and a new societal narrative support retraining, a measure China is looking to implement, as well as financial support in the form of unemployment benefits while a worker gains new qualifications. A new report by the World Economic Forum, Towards a Reskilling Revolution: Industry-Led Action for the Future of Work , posits that 95% of 1.4 million at-risk workers in the United States can pivot into positions that have similar skills and higher wages, at an approximate cost of $34 billion. Yet the private sector could only profitably reskill 25% of them, with the rest likely being cheaper to replace. If the government pushes public resources into reskilling and upskilling initiatives, however, it could retrain 77% of these at-risk workers - and save money in the long run through higher tax returns and less unemployment compensation. It needs only the political will to do so. The goal is not merely to adapt to the challenges of the Fourth Industrial Revolution but to actively foster more inclusion in the workplace and beyond - harnessing disruption as an impetus 49 World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2019 for social progress, bringing marginalized workers and groups into the mainstream for the benefit of all. Gender parity in employment, for example, is still 108 years off, according to an estimate by the World Economic Forum. Despite a rising number of women in leadership roles, the culture needs to change for fundamental biases to be addressed. \"We need to visualize that it is possible with role models,\" said Michelle Bachelet, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, in an all-female panel hosted by The New York Times . Chrystia Freeland, Foreign Minister of Canada, added: \"We shouldn't be afraid of having targets. You have to create the conditions where women want to be successful.\" The rights of LGBTQ workers must also be bolstered. Some countries have taken steps backwards recently even as positive strides are made elsewhere. One panel suggested that commissions could be set up in large companies to investigate prejudice and enforce standards. Workers struggling with mental health issues should also have Session The Creativity Lab We need outstanding talent in our company, which means we have to take diversity and inclusion really seriously, and disability plays a huge role in that for us Duncan Tait, President and Chief Executive Officer for Europe, Middle East, India and Africa, Fujitsu The best video answers are featured on https://www.weforum.org/globalization4Globalization 4.0: What should work look like in the future? Today's global risks need global solutions. We've identified six key questions we must address to make Globalization 4.0 work for all.World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 201950 more protection under employment codes. And a further group that seems to be woefully neglected in the world of business is individuals with a disability, despite numbering 1.3 billion, or one in seven worldwide, including the 80% of disabilities that are invisible. \"Disability, collectively, is the most marginalized group of people in the world,\" said Caroline Casey, Founder of Binc. Technology has its role to play - an exhibit at the Annual Meeting displayed cutting-edge tech as applied to the disability field, from eye-tracking keyboards to dynamic Braille watches - but is not a panacea. A more expedient solution is to promote the business case for inclusion. For LGBTQ individuals, one study found that 62% went back in the closet when joining a large corporation and were 30% less productive as a result. The cost of disability exclusion in OECD countries, in turn, is an estimated 7%. Inclusive corporate policy \"is just the right thing to do, and it's good business\", said Carolyn Tastad, Group President, North America, Procter & Gamble. Paul Polman, Chief Executive Officer, Unilever, added: \"If you as a company show respect for every individual, you have a better chance of being respected.\" The case for equality, crucially, is not limited to employment and human capital but relates to the broader need for a new societal narrative in the age of Globalization 4.0. In this age of the \"growth paradox\" - namely, that as the world economy grows, so, too, does inequality - populist risings around the world, such as Brexit and the gilets jaunes (yellow vest movement) in France, are proxies of a deeper malaise among the middle and lower classes who feel economically disenfranchised. Guy Standing, Research Professor in Development Studies at the University of London, noted: \"We've got a new class fragmentation taking place, with a plutocracy at the top, an elite represented here [at Davos] ... and a new precariat emerging.\" One formula to redress these imbalances, some participants agreed on the closing day of the Annual Meeting, is to enforce taxation and close tax loopholes so that all businesses pay their fair share. \"Extreme economic inequality is out of control,\" said Winnie Byanyima, Executive Director of Oxfam International. \"Talking about it isn't good enough.\" Robert E. Moritz, Global Chairman of PwC International, suggested an overhaul of the world's tax systems, while author and entrepreneur Hilary Cottam called for an attendant \"social revolution\" to accompany the new technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, noting that all industrial revolutions give rise to inequality. \"We need a new development paradigm,\" said Alicia B\u00e1rcena Ibarra, Executive Secretary of the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) - one where equality is \"a prerequisite for development,\" as well as incentivizing productivity. Civil society will play a key role in framing the conversation around that new, inclusive model of growth. Meanwhile, the existential risk of climate change could provide the \"moral equivalent of war\" to galvanize action, according to Rutger Bregman, author and historian at De Correspondent. Above all, the \"us vs them\" mentality, where immigrants or marginalized groups become the scapegoats for economic malaise, should be avoided as both people and structures adapt to globalization.Stories matter. To shape a new global architecture that includes all stakeholders in the world's shared prosperity, a fresh narrative is needed: one that looks beyond GDP and growth alone to include the disadvantaged and make Globalization 4.0 work for all.Human capital and a new societal narrative51 World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2019Forum Agenda What the next 20 years will mean for jobs - and how to prepare The Forum Agenda attracts more than 4 million readers every month. The following article is among the most read blogs on the theme of Globalization 4.0. The next two decades promise a full-scale revolution in our working lives. Before we look into the next 20 years, let's take a quick look at the present - and something once considered paradoxical. We're already living in an age of a lot of robots - and a lot of jobs. As the number of robots at work has reached record levels, it's worth noting that in 2018 the global unemployment level fell to 5.2%, according to a report last month - the lowest level in 38 years. In other words, high tech and high employment don't have to be mutually exclusive. We're living the proof of that today. Given this synchronicity between employment and tech, I believe there are reasons to be hopeful that jobs will become more accessible, more flexible and more liberating over the next two decades.

Earlier this year she was the first woman to be appointed Chief Conductor of the Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra and, in 2013, was the first woman in 118 years to conduct the BBC's \"Last Night of the Proms\". She has tirelessly endeavoured to provide opportunities for all people to access music towards a world where diversity in classical music is the norm rather than the exception. In Baltimore, she launched the \"OrchKids\" programme to serve the city's less privileged children, and the BSO Academy and Rusty Musicians for adult amateur musicians. She is also Music Director of the S\u00e3o Paulo Symphony Orchestra. A graduate of Yale University and a MacArthur Fellow (2005), at the Annual Meeting she will lead the Opening Performance with the Taki Concordia Orchestra. \"Attending the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in 2006 inspired me to strive to become a more engaged world citizen, and I am deeply honoured to return to accept the Crystal Award and share my journey during these past 13 years.\"Marin Alsop For her leadership in championing diversity in musicArts and Culture in Davos Monday 21 January, Congress Hall, 18.00 - 18.30 The Crystal Awards celebrate the achievements of artists and cultural figures whose leadership has inspired inclusive and sustainable change.

The breakthrough success of her 2005 documentary \"Women Without Shadows\" initiated a new wave of Saudi filmmakers and front-page headlines of Saudi Arabia finally opening cinemas in the kingdom. She was recently appointed to the Board of the General Authority for Culture to advise on the development of the cultural and arts sectors in Saudi Arabia. She recently released \"Mary Shelley\", starring Elle Fanning, and \"Nappily Ever After\", starring Sanaa Lathan. Al-Mansour is the first artist from the Arabian Gulf region to be invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. \"I hope this award gives encouragement to women everywhere who want to break from tradition, and who want to be who they are without fear of being judged. That is a quality we need to cultivate as women, because we are still vulnerable when it comes to not being accepted. This award shows the value of stepping out of line, and taking a chance to go after our dreams and what we believe in.\" Sir David Attenborough's broadcasting career spans six decades. He has played an extraordinary role in both reinventing and developing the medium of television, and in connecting people to the wonders of the natural world, bringing distant peoples, animals and habitats into living rooms across the planet. As a BBC producer and executive, he has played a crucial part in creating new forms of programming and scheduling that, to this day, influence global broadcasting. His work includes many iconic productions, from the ground- breaking \"Zoo Quest\" series to programmes including Living Planet\", key sequences from \"Our Planet\", a new series focusing on the preservation of life on Earth. \"I have always been fascinated by nature and have endeavoured to share my enthusiasm with as many people as possible through television.

It was designed in consultation with Pro Infirmis, the leading Swiss agency for the support and inclusion of people with disabilities. 57 World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2019World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 201958 Finding Hope This monumental, site-specific installation is a response by Iranian artist Mehdi Ghadyanloo to the Annual Meeting's theme of Globalization 4.0. Entitled Finding Hope, its surrealist vision offers an evocative reminder of our need to eschew simplistic narratives and engage with the myriad complexities of our global society. Ghadyanloo is Iran's foremost public artist. He is known for his utopian and philosophical paintings that explore universal human emotions such as fear, hope and loss. Through the portrayal of minimalist environments, surreal architectural arrangements and the repeated use of symbolic motifs such as stairs, balloons and aeroplanes, Ghadyanloo invites us to consider the shared universality of our existence.Large-scale, immersive and interactive installations inside and outside the Congress Centre helped us see in new ways and with more clarity some of the most pressing issues the world faces.

This exhibition, specially curated for the Annual Meeting 2019, includes the works of cartoonists from Algeria, Austria, Canada, Cuba, France, Iran, Italy, Mexico, Switzerland, Syria and the United States. They are members of Cartooning for Peace, a network of 184 artists from 64 countries dedicated to defending freedom of speech in the spirit of dialogue. Through the art and humour of the cartoons selected for this exhibition, there was reflection on some of the thorny issues and cultural taboos that come between us and our ability to make a \"Globalization 4.0\" more inclusive and sustainable. Developed in collaboration with Cartooning for Peace and its Vice-Chair, the Swiss cartoonist Patrick Chappatte. World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 201960 Produced by the Natural History Museum in London, the venerated Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition showcases the world's best nature photography and photojournalism.

Chibanda recognized that they were not just terrific listeners but also, with training and resources, could provide appropriate and effective support. The success of the Friendship Bench programme, which has been proven through clinical trials, has led to plans to replicate it in other countries around the world to enhance mental well-being and improve quality of life in communities. Come and meet Chibanda, sit on the bench yourself, spread the word and join the conversation by learning about how low-cost, scalable and effective interventions could enhance mental well-being for millions of people.

The essential thesis is that major shifts under way in technology, geopolitics, environment and society are combining to give birth to a new phase of globalization - Globalization 4.0 - whose trajectory will depend in large measure on how well governance at multiple levels - governmental, corporate and international - adapts to these changes. Strengthening our governance architecture to ensure its effectiveness in this new era will require deeper engagement and heightened imagination by all stakeholders, beginning with robust and sustained dialogue among them. The context for governance and cooperation is changing due to the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Economies, businesses, societies and politics are being transformed by technological advances in such areas as artificial intelligence and machine learning, the internet of things, autonomous vehicles, drones, precision medicine and genomics, advanced materials, smart grids, robotics and big data. This wave of technological disruption is coinciding and interacting with three other, equally epochal, transformations in the global economic and political context. An increasingly urgent set of ecological imperatives, including but not limited to global warming; the growing multipolarity of international relations and plurilateralization of the world economy; and rising social discontent within many countries regarding the inequity of socioeconomic outcomes from economic growth. To help move the discussion of Globalization 4.0 from diagnosis to action, during the Annual Meeting the Forum shared a consultation version of a draft White Paper to participants, titled Globalization 4.0: Shaping a New Global Architecture in the Age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The White Paper - to be published following the Annual Meeting - provides an overview of some of the important weaknesses in the world economy's cooperative architecture that have been exposed by recent changes in its operating context. And it spotlights some of the most promising opportunities available to address these weaknesses, which are deserving of greater consideration and commitment by government, business and other leaders in Davos and beyond. We encourage all members of the Forum's network to respond to the call for engagement inherent in the Annual Meeting's theme by thinking about how they and their organizations could contribute concretely to the policy and enabling architecture improvements needed in this new era, by supporting one or another of these initiatives or indeed by bringing others to the table. The White Paper is available here for your review. Comments and suggestions on this consultation draft can be sent to G4.0@weforum.org.

Since obtaining ISO 20121 certification in 2018 for \"sustainable event management\", the Forum has successfully passed its first annual surveillance audit and confirmed that sustainability is improving at the event. How was sustainability enhanced at the Annual Meeting this year? Transport - While continuing to organize sustainable transport options for participants (promoting walking, with maps, paths and the distribution of shoe grips; an efficient shuttle service serving the main locations; free access to public buses), for the first time this year the Forum decided to reimburse 50% of the train ticket price for certain communities if they chose to come to Switzerland by train instead of flying. In addition, 50 fully electric vehicles were pilot-tested and included in the Forum's fleet. Resources - In continuing its efforts to use materials more efficiently, the Forum has worked with its Partners to reduce single-use plastic. Additional water stations were installed in the Congress Centre and the Media Village to enable the use of reusable water bottles. Integrating a circular economy approach, institutional publications are produced by a Cradle-to-Cradle certified printing company based in Switzerland. As every year, the Annual Meeting's carbon footprint is fully compensated in an internationally recognized way. Read more about the Forum's sustainability strategy here or by scanning this QR code.
