In 2016 to celebrating the School's 35th anniversary we launched a graduates alumni. All the homeopaths below graduated from the School. The alumni creates a network of like-minded homeopaths that can connect and support one another and it gives the public access to a list of students that have a trained with the School. Please note: because we only launched this area in 2016 it is an incomplete list. Latest Graduates [bioghide](#) Johanna Karpov AdvPDHom live in South Chailey, in East Sussex now but only a year ago I was living in Wick Street, Stroud and I could have walked to college! We moved away after my in-laws died and we had the opportunity to take on the Russell family home here. Too tempting not too, since I am mother to four and we needed the house room. I'm from Sussex originally and so is my husband Patrick so we knew what we were letting ourselves in for. Before I had children I was a professional investor, Fund Manager of European Equities for a UK investment house. I was good at it but I didn't like it very much and it definitely didn't go hand in hand with raising a family which is what I always really wanted to do. So, below is a summary of the work I do around the edges of that and while being wife and mother these past 20 years. The only thing missing - because I'm not teaching at the moment - is my career as a karate instructor. I have black belts in Shorinryu Mukenkai Karate do and Renshinkan Shorinryu Karate do and ran a school out in the sticks in Gloucestershire until we moved away. Interests of mine are many and varied Nature - being outside in it a lot, biodynamic gardening, walking my dog in the woods, fields and by the sea, living in harmony with the seasons. Wellbeing - I like cooking organically, preferably with home grown ingredients, yoga, meditation, karate practice, running. Creativity - perfumery, candle making, writing, dressmaking, decorating (luckily because I have a big project on my hands with our new place). Relaxation - Reading. I like cookbooks, history, textbooks, witchcraft, self sufficiency, sci-fi and magic. Music - I listen to a lot of classical music and I like opera but my favourite music is very heavy metal. Education Advanced Practitioners Diploma in Homeopathy - School of Homeopathy Reiki Master Level 2, teacher of traditional Usui Shiki Ryoho Travelling Homeopaths Collective Pathology and Disease Diploma - School of Health Certified M Technique practitioner (RJ Buckle Associates) Level 3 Diploma Aromatherapy (ITEC) Merit - includes Anatomy and Physiology diploma Level 2 Perfumery training - Cotswold Perfumery Reiki Master - Reiki Level Level 1 - Usui Shiki Crisis - Sheila Kitzinger recognised Birth and Postnatal Doula Working Doula Training - British School of Nurturing Doulas Doula Training and Perinatal First Aid - Michel Odent (Paramana) Doula Training - British School of Nurturing Doulas Investment Management Certificate - Institute of Investment Management and Research After a first career in Fund Management and subsequent time out to have four children, Sophia became a Birth and Postnatal Doula and was honoured to accompany many women and their families through pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period. While learning (and later teaching) Karate Do she became fascinated by the concept of channelling energy for healing and so trained in the Usui Shiki Ryoho lineage of Reiki and these days she is a master practitioner and teacher. Studies in anatomy, physiology, chemistry, botany and the safe use of essential oils for specific health issues followed and Sophia became a Clinical Aromatherapist. She loves to tailor essential oils in a bespoke blend to suit the needs of the individual, be they physical, mental or emotional. Scent and its power to heal lead her to train as a Perfumier, delighting in compounding \"Perfume with a Purpose\". She chose to train as an M Technique practitioner (and, later on a teacher) so she could offer healing touch to people who are very fragile and for whom traditional massage is unsuitable. Sophia is now a Registered Homeopath and never ceases to be amazed by the gentle and effective healing this wonderful system of medicine can bring. She is a member of the Society of Homeopaths, the Travelling Homeopaths Collective and the Federation of Holistic Therapists. Occupation Clinical Aromatherapist Proprietress Hestia's Flame Natural Candles Perfumier Reiki Master M Technique #21 Sunset Crescent, Bio In high school I was sure I would study medicine. At age 14, I was interested in dermatology, but by the end of high school I wanted to be a shaman. For college, I went off to study pre-med. I knew right away after working at the university hospital that this was not where I wanted to be. I transferred out, switched my major several times and ultimately settled on business. In the years following graduation I had a very jumpy career but I realized there was one common thread, caretaker; of children, the elderly, dolphins (yes, dolphins!) and the environment. I was not familiar with homeopathy until April of this year when I was recommended a homeopath by my daughter's' pediatrician. It was the most positive experience I had ever had with a doctor. After that visit, I realized I wanted to practice Homeopathy. It was the perfect fit for everything I had wanted to be: healer, dermatologist, philosopher, counselor, scientist, and even artist.
