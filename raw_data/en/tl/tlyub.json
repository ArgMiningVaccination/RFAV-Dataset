Limited information exists on the health-promoting behavioral norms and obesity rates among children living anthroposophical vs. conventional lifestyles. Aims: This study aims to compare the prevalence of childhood obesity, and parents' perceptions of their children's food environment, between anthroposophical and conventional education systems. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the National Anthropometric Measurement Survey for first grade students in Israel, comparing anthroposophical schools with matched conventional schools. Additionally, an online survey was distributed among parents of children in both school systems, assessing children's eating norms and dietary intake. Results: Overweight and obesity rates were higher among students in conventional schools (n = 205,500) compared to anthroposophical schools (n = 2247) (11.2% vs. 9.6%, and 7.8% vs. 4.8%, respectively; Pv < 0.001). Anthroposophical schools were perceived by more parents to have health-promoting curricula, health promoting teacher behavior, and health promoting social dietary norms, while their children's dietary intake was perceived as healthier both in school and in the after-school, social, and familial environment (Pv < 0.001). Conclusions: Children in anthroposophical education exhibited lower overweight and obesity rates, and engaged in more health-promoting behaviors. Further research is needed to explore the relationship between the anthroposophical lifestyle and childhood obesity, and to identify effective anthroposophical strategies for health promotion among children.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-07-10", "cleaned_text": "Children in the Anthroposophical Education System Have Lower Rates of Obesity, and Higher Rates of Health Promoting Behaviors [https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15143088](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15143088) [The Role of Nutritional Intervention in Obesity Treatment]( /journal/nutrients/special_issues/6KINW2W2U2 )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-nutrients-15-03088)]. Childhood obesity is likely to persist into adulthood, therefore, current trends predict a population of adults exposed to the impact of excess adiposity for a long period of time. This, in turn, is likely to lead to more serious health consequences at both the individual and the population level [ [2](#B2-nutrients-15-03088), [3](#B3-nutrients-15-03088)]. Obesity is a complex multifactorial disease defined by excessive adiposity, and is linked to an increased risk for many non-communicable diseases (NCDs) [ [4](#B4-nutrients-15-03088)], including cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and chronic respiratory diseases, including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) [ [5](#B5-nutrients-15-03088), [6](#B6-nutrients-15-03088), [7](#B7-nutrients-15-03088)]. [8](#B8-nutrients-15-03088), [9](#B9-nutrients-15-03088)]. In Israel, as part of student health services, starting in 2013, growth assessment has routinely been performed for students in the first grade. According to the data gathered, the prevalence of overweight and obesity among male first grade pupils in Israel from 2018 to 2019 and 2020 increased from 17.7% to 18.3% and 19.7%, respectively. Among girls, the prevalence of overweight and obesity was 18.9%, 19.2%, and 20.7%, respectively. [10](#B10-nutrients-15-03088)] encompassing additive and multiplicative interactions between genes and environment that may be reflected in one's food consumption, a sedentary lifestyle, and sociocultural provocations [ [11](#B11-nutrients-15-03088)]. [12](#B12-nutrients-15-03088), [13](#B13-nutrients-15-03088)]. [14](#B14-nutrients-15-03088)]. Second, the education system may choose to emphasize the healthy diet and lifestyle in their curriculum. Similarly to schools, other educational or recreational facilities for children have been shown to play an important role in shaping children's dietary choices [ [15](#B15-nutrients-15-03088)]. [16](#B16-nutrients-15-03088), [17](#B17-nutrients-15-03088)]. It includes references to mental health, the maintenance of a healthy diet, and the performance of physical activity [ [18](#B18-nutrients-15-03088)]. The nutritional agenda in anthroposophical education is guided by the belief that food plays a crucial role in the physical, mental, and spiritual development of a child. The anthroposophical education system advocates in favor of a vegetarian diet, and all kindergarten served meals are vegetarian. The system also often places a strong emphasis on prioritizing fresh, whole foods, home-cooked meals, and garden-grown fruit and vegetables. On the other hand, it encourages pupils to avoid processed foods and artificial ingredients. There is also a strong emphasis on the interconnectedness of food, agriculture, and the environment. These concepts are expressed through routine activities which are incorporated into the curriculum, such as gardening, communal cooking, and recycling [ [19](#B19-nutrients-15-03088), [20](#B20-nutrients-15-03088)]. Parents who choose to educate their children in an anthroposophical school may incorporate these concepts further into their home and social environment. Taken together, these school and familial behavioral norms may play a crucial part in the prevention of childhood obesity. Moreover, students of anthroposophical education have been found to have better health indicators, such as fewer allergies and stomachaches, and lower rates of hypertension, eczema, and antibiotic use, compared to students in conventional education [ [21](#B21-nutrients-15-03088)]. Former pupils of Waldorf schools were also found to better endure significant emotional loads, life stress, and crises [ [18](#B18-nutrients-15-03088)]. Moreover, mothers to children in anthroposophical schools have been shown to have had a lower BMI before and after their pregnancy, compared to mothers of children in conventional schools [ [22](#B22-nutrients-15-03088)]. This is assumed to reflect a holistic lifestyle, which includes a plant-based, minimally processed diet, and an active lifestyle, which are fundamental components of the anthroposophical lifestyle philosophy. Parents' choice to enroll their children in an anthroposophical education system is assumed to reflect other aspects of their behavior. In turn, these holistic lifestyle characteristics are postulated to promote lower pediatric obesity rates. 2. Materials and Methods - Phase 1: Assess the prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity among first grade students between the anthroposophical and conventional educational systems. 2.1. Study Population 2.2. Data Collection [23](#B23-nutrients-15-03088)]. It is a national initiative to monitor childhood obesity rates, for the promotion of prevention and treatment practices. Measurements are performed by dedicated and trained nurses according to a systematic protocol, and include weight (kg) and height (m) measurement, body mass index (BMI) calculation (BMI = weight/height2), and BMI percentile categorization, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) BMI growth charts. The anthropometric categorization of each student was made as: severe and underweight: BMI 3rd percentile. The sum of the students who were candidates for anthropometric evaluation, the sum of the students eventually measured, and the sum of the students in each anthropometric category were recorded. We excluded measurements from classes with an irregular number of children (>45 or <10 children per class), and in which a large proportion of students were not measured (>80% of candidates). The total number of measured students, and the number of students categorized to each of the anthropometric categories were summed, from anthroposophical and conventional schools separately. The proportion of students in each anthropometric category was calculated separately for anthroposophical and conventional schools in Israel. From each of the schools included, measurements from three consecutive school years were included. - Phase 2: Identify parental attitudes regarding their children's food environment, between the parents of children in anthroposophical and conventional educational systems. A cross-sectional study was performed via an anonymous online survey filled in by parents of elementary school children. Participation was voluntary; no incentives were offered. 2.3. Study Population [https://www.qualtrics.com/](https://www.qualtrics.com/), accessed on 14 June 2023), and distributed between March and May 2021 through the following social media platforms: (1) WhatsApp groups of parents from anthroposophical and conventional schools, (2) Facebook groups of parents from different regions in Israel, and (3) on the researchers' private Facebook accounts. Survey participants were encouraged to distribute the questionnaire link to other parents among their friends and family, in order to achieve maximum exposure. From all the responses to the questionnaire (parents who opened the questionnaire link), we included only complete questionnaires (with a response to >90% of questions), from parents with at least one child studying in elementary school (first-sixth grade) in either anthroposophical or conventional education. Responses were excluded if they were from parents of children in the ultra-Orthodox educational system, because this system does not include anthroposophical schools. 2.4. Research Tools [24](#B24-nutrients-15-03088)]. The questionnaire was developed by a multidisciplinary expert committee. Its aim was to elucidate the perceived difference between anthroposophical and conventional schools, in aspects related to children's food environment and dietary intake. The study questionnaire structure and content validation were assessed using a pilot sample of 15 participants. The participants were asked to provide feedback on the readability and understandability of the questionnaire, and the time needed to fill out the questionnaire. Changes were made to the questionnaire accordingly [ [24](#B24-nutrients-15-03088)]. The questionnaire includes questions regarding the perceived role of the educational system in imparting a healthy lifestyle, actual health-promoting behaviors at school and in kindergarten, and the nutritional norm at after-school activities, at community events, and at home. Questions further referred to parents' perceived frequency of food consumption by their children, parents' body image, and personal and familial demographic parameters. Lastly, the questionnaire included open questions, by which the parents were given the opportunity to provide free-text answers regarding the dietary habits and norms in their children's educational system. All, but the open questions, were multiple choice, and answers were coded to qualitatively reflect a parent's identification with an educational measure. The full version of the questionnaire is depicted in [Appendix A](#app1-nutrients-15-03088). [Table 1](#nutrients-15-03088-t001)). For instance, all statements about parents' perceived role of the educational system in imparting a healthy lifestyle were scored (questions 12.1-4), and the mean score of these statements was presented as the total index score. Higher index scores represent a stronger identification with the measure in question. 2.5. Statistical Analysis [25](#B25-nutrients-15-03088)]. The narratives were analyzed, to determine the key themes. The analysis involved indexing the data, sorting and selecting quotes in order to place them in the appropriate thematic category, and developing a final interpretation. 3. Results 3.1. Phase 1: Prevalence of Childhood Overweight and Obesity among First Grade Students between Anthroposophical and Conventional Educational Systems [Table 2](#nutrients-15-03088-t002). 3.2. Phase 2: Attitudes and Perceptions of Parents Regarding Their Children's Food Environment [Table 3](#nutrients-15-03088-t003)). 3.3. Parental Perception of Their Child's Dietary Intake and Food Environment, and Their Own Body Image [Table 4](#nutrients-15-03088-t004)). [Table 5](#nutrients-15-03088-t005). 4. Discussion [26](#B26-nutrients-15-03088)]. Israel is composed of a multiethnic population, with traditional Mediterranean diet heritage, but with an acceleration in sugar-sweetened beverages and ultra-processed foods intake during the last decade. [27](#B27-nutrients-15-03088)], thus a selection bias may not be overruled, and this remains a probable confounder for the results. Also, a major limitation of this analysis is the cross-sectional design, which could not demonstrate a temporal association and a causal link between children's educational system, their associated diet and lifestyle, and children's anthropometric status. [28](#B28-nutrients-15-03088)]. Interestingly, in our study, parents also described significant differences in children's eating patterns further into the day, at after-school activities, and during social events, playdates, birthday parties, etc. These occasions may be a major contributor to the total intake of sweets and snacks among children, and may pave the way to their adulthood dietary norms [ [29](#B29-nutrients-15-03088), [30](#B30-nutrients-15-03088)]. Parents of children in anthroposophical schools also reported a higher sense of support from other parents in their school, regarding their preferred dietary practices, and the perception of body image was more positive among parents of children in anthroposophical education, compared to parents of children in conventional education. Although parents are thought to exert the primary influence on their children's dietary and physical-activity behaviors, a study of weight trajectory modelling from the age of 2 to 7 years clearly showed that risk factors for an unhealthy body weight and poor diet extend beyond children's homes [ [31](#B31-nutrients-15-03088)]. Evidence suggests that children's food environments, mainly in schools, childcare settings, and children's recreational facilities, play an important role in supporting healthy food choices and limiting exposure to unhealthy foods and beverages [ [15](#B15-nutrients-15-03088)]. It seems from our results that parents of children in anthroposophical schools perceive a stronger link between the dietary behavioral norms of children in school and after-school. The fact that both groups of parents reported a high importance and awareness of healthy diets and lifestyle reveals the difficulty that parents of children in conventional schools face in their attempt to maintain a continuous healthy lifestyle, against the dietary norms of their surroundings. [32](#B32-nutrients-15-03088)], performing physical activity [ [33](#B33-nutrients-15-03088), [34](#B34-nutrients-15-03088)], screen time [ [35](#B35-nutrients-15-03088)], etc., all of which are established risk factors for obesity. Furthermore, besides parental perceptions of their children's dietary behaviors and norms, their child's anthropometrics were not collected, so an association between these factors was not assessed. Additionally, chronic diseases, or emotional or developmental difficulties were not evaluated. These could be found in higher proportions within the anthroposophical education system, as it places a greater emphasis on personal special needs as part of its philosophy [ [36](#B36-nutrients-15-03088)]. The anthroposophical education system in Israel is characterized by a higher teacher/pupil ratio and smaller classes, enabling a more personal relationship between teachers and students, and between peers. The fundamental difficulties of children which lead to the anthroposophical choice may reflect in eating developmental difficulties, which may explain the higher rates of underweight detected in this population. This hypothesis should be tested in a further studies. Last, a major limitation of this analysis is the cross-sectional design, which could not demonstrate a temporal association and a causal link between children's educational system, their associated diet and lifestyle, and children's anthropometric status. [11](#B11-nutrients-15-03088), [12](#B12-nutrients-15-03088), [13](#B13-nutrients-15-03088), [14](#B14-nutrients-15-03088)]. These influences are found in many aspects of a child's life, including school [ [37](#B37-nutrients-15-03088)], healthcare facilities [ [37](#B37-nutrients-15-03088), [38](#B38-nutrients-15-03088)], the neighborhood, and other community settings [ [39](#B39-nutrients-15-03088)]. 5.

I believe that teachers and care-givers in an educational setting should provide children with a healthy environment (Q12-2). In my opinion, the teachers of my child's school promote a healthy dietary pattern, which they maintain themselves (Q12-3). In my opinion, the teachers of my child's school care about his/her nutrition (Q12-4).||0.866||1-5| |Perceived health-promoting behavior of teachers and school curriculum 1||< - On school special occasions (such as a trip, graduation party, teachers' day, birthday celebrations, etc.), the food served usually includes snacks (Q15-1). On school special occasions, organizers try, as much as possible, to use reusable utensils (Q15-5).| ** The teacher usually goes out with the class for a nature walk once a week (Q13-1). Most mornings, students preform physical activity, such as jumping rope/running as part of the curriculum (Q13-2). Usually, the teacher takes the class to the garden, to plant fruit or vegetables. When it is time to harvest them, the children can taste them (Q13-3). The school has strict guidelines regarding the nutritional content of food brought from home, and parents are instructed by the teacher about the permitted content of the lunch box/between meal snack, birthday parties, festivals, trips (Q13-4). If nutrition guidelines are given to students and parents, the teachers usually monitor the implementation of the guidelines (Q13-5). In my children's curriculum, there are lessons dedicated to lifestyle, nutrition and health (Q13-6). At school the concept of a healthy diet is integrated naturally into different activities, such as food preparation, songs, vegetable gardens, arts and crafts (Q13-7). The teacher sits and eats breakfast with the children (Q13-8). Before breakfast, the teacher gathers the children and carries out a small ritual/says a prayer (Q13-9). < - Sometimes, during meals at school, children watch a program or movie (Q13-10). |0.877||1-0| |Perceived after-school birthday celebrations.||** Children born in the same month usually celebrate birthday parties together (Q14-1).

At preschool, the children participate in all processes of food preparation including cleaning up (Q16-2). The food my child ate during his time at preschool was very healthy (Q16-3).

My child's teachers care about his/her nutrition (Q16-5).||0.900||1-5| |Perceived difference between the accepted eating pattern at home and that of friends and family members||* When my child is on a playdate at a friend's or family member's home, where the food served is different compared to that in my home, I feel uncomfortable (Q23-1). My child enjoys eating at other people's homes when he is exposed to foods less heathy than the food served at home (Q23-2).
