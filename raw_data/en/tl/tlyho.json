You are embarking on a new and exciting phase of your life and have chosen to do so at one of the premier public universities in the nation. Regardless of whether you have a good idea of what you plan to major in or have no notion at all, I encourage you to explore widely the vast array of academic offerings available to you on the beautiful Bloomington campus. Exploring in this way will bring you into contact with some of the many opportunities provided by IUB's fine departments and schools. As you do this, you will either discover that you really do have a predisposition toward a certain major or you will develop a new, exciting, and possibly previously unknown interest in and opportunity for your undergraduate studies here at IU. University Division (UD) is a wonderful place to begin your academic exploration. Your UD advisor will help you develop a plan that enables you to explore your options while at the same time making progress toward the undergraduate degree that you are setting out to earn. You should talk to your advisor regularly to receive assistance in setting your goals and in answering whatever questions may arise. UD advisors have a wealth of knowledge and experience and will be happy to help you navigate the university's many academic options and choices. As you set out on this new path, it's important to remember that there are lots of activities competing for your interest and time, and that college life can bring new challenges, both in the classroom and beyond. Despite the many opportunities available to you outside the classroom, remember that your main focus should be on your studies. There are many things you can do to ensure success on the academic side including making sure you get to know your professors and that you let them get to know you. The best way to do so is to take advantage of your instructor's office hours: this is a period of time when you can receive individualized assistance and also provides your instructor the opportunity to develop a working relationship with you as an individual. When you're not studying, take advantage of the many social, cultural, and extracurricular activities the Bloomington campus and community have to offer. Get involved in your residence hall, play an intramural sport, attend a concert at the Jacob School of Music, study abroad, cheer on your favorite intercollegiate team, volunteer in the community\u2014the list of opportunities and choices is seemingly endless. Take full advantage of the many things IUB has to offer you educationally , culturally , and socially . Your college experience and the friends you make here will be something you will remember and cherish for the rest of your life. I extend a warm welcome to you, encourage you to maximize all of your opportunities by becoming an active member of the campus community , and wish you every success in your studies here on the Bloomington campus of Indiana University . Kurt Zorn Associate Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education University Division Guide 2010-2011 5 T able of Contents Greetings types of courses should I consider taking during my GUIDE WITH YOU TO YOUR ADVISING CONFERENCE6 University Division Guide 2010-2011 Part I Preparing for Advising & Registration As a student on the IU Bloomington (IUB) campus, you are responsible for your academic life right from the start. Here is some important advice as you begin: (1) Prepare for your first academic advising conference before you come to Bloomington for your campus orientation program. The orientation schedule is packed with meetings, activities, and interesting people. There will be little or no time for you to prepare for your advising session during the orientation program. (2) Get familiar with some basic information resources. To assist you in making informed academic choices for your first semester on campus, University Division (UD) offers all students the UD Guide and the e-Guide to Schools and Majors , which can be found on the New Student Section of the UD website under e-Guide to Schools and Majors (http://ud.iub.edu/fs_eguide.php). In addition, there is new information for incoming students posted on the New Student section of the UD website at ud.iub.edu/fs.php. To make good decisions for your first semester on campus, it is critical that you read and refer to these resources. (3) Fill out your Academic Planning Worksheet (APW) (centerfold of this document) completely and bring it with you to your orientation advising conference. Academic advisors answer questions, respond to concerns, discuss interests, provide information about academic options, explain admission and degree requirements, and consider placement and testing information before they make recommendations. They are available to provide information that will help you make choices with more confidence as you build an academic schedule that reflects your individual needs and interests. (4) Prepare thoughtfully for your orientation advising conference. As you read the materials listed above you will find programs and courses that interest you, and you may have questions. Write these things down. Academic advisors are interested in helping you make a successful transition to academic life at IUB. It is important that you bring your ideas and concerns to your academic advisor for discussion. Remember, as a college student, you are responsible for the academic choices and decisions you make. So please\u2014take sufficient time to thoroughly prepare for your orientation advising appointment. It is expected, and you will find that it's worth the effort! What will orientation program advising be like? In preparation for your academic experience at IUB you will attend three meetings. One will be led by the Office of the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education (OVPUE) and will lead into the Professor's Perspective. These first two meetings provide a broad introduction to the undergraduate experience at IUB. Then in the UD meeting, you will learn how to make final preparations for your academic advising appointment. You will also have an individual advising conference to review your Academic Planning Worksheet (APW) and develop a plan of study for your first semester. You are expected to arrive for your appointment with a thoroughly prepared APW. You will leave with a Course Enrollment Plan (CEP) listing courses you are interested in taking and explanations of how these courses will contribute to your progress toward a degree. After your individual advising conference you will enroll in classes at a registration site. Your CEP will guide you as you enroll. How should I prepare for orientation program advising? Read this Guide and refer to it as you complete the Academic Planning Worksheet (APW) (centerfold fo this book). As you read, keep in mind your interests and goals. The essential information you will need to give your advisor is what areas of study or majors you like, the courses you are interested in taking, and your questions. Use the APW to organize this information.You are responsible for your enrollment and for keeping track of your academic progress.Part I Preparing for Advising & Registration 7 Which placement tests will I take during orientation? IUB offers a number of placement exams during orientation. Some are required, while others are optional. Read this information carefully so that you will know which exams to expect, and which you may choose to take. REQUIRED PLACEMENT EXAMS The following exams are required, and will be scheduled for you. You will discuss your scores and their meaning for your fall class choices during your individual advising conference. Mathematical Skills Assessment (MSA) This 30-minute test consists of 26 multiple choice questions that measure your algebra skills and readiness for specific IUB math courses. You cannot earn credit based on your MSA score, and it does not appear on any transcript or affect any of your grades. The results will help you make the best decision about which math courses to take. Bring a #2 pencil to use for the MSA. Calculators are prohibited. Foreign Language Placement T ests If you have studied one or more years of foreign language in high school, you will be required to take a foreign language placement test during your IUB orientation. The test is required even if you do not currently plan to continue foreign language study . Even if you have already taken another foreign language test such as the AP or CEEB Achievement test, you are still required to test at IUB to validate your placement. Testing opportunities will be available in French, German, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Russian, and Spanish during your orientation program. Let your advisor know if you are interested in taking more than one foreign language placement test or testing in a language not listed above. If you plan to continue studying the language you took in high school, your advisor will help you determine your placement level based on your test score and will discuss any special credit you may be able to claim. If you are an international student whose native language is not English, you are not eligible for special credit in your native language. If testing is available in your native language, however, you may be able to use your placement to complete or partially complete the foreign language requirement for some degree programs. OPTIONAL PLACEMENT EXAMS The following information will help you make good choices about other placement exams that you should take before or during orientation. Be sure to note when these exams are offered. Chemistry Placement Exam (CPE) The Chemistry Placement Exam (CPE) is required if you plan to enroll in CHEM-C 117. You must take the CPE online by June 1 (before you arrive at orientation). A link to the CPE with additional information is available at chem.indiana.edu/ugrad/cpe-asp. You may take this exam only once each semester. Your orientation advisor will discuss your CPE score with you and will use it, along with your IU Math Skills Assessment score, to help you choose one of the following chemistry classes: CHEM-C 103, CHEM-C 117, or CHEM-S 117. You may read about these courses in the \"Course Descriptions\" section of this Guide. Biology Departmental Exam The Biology Departmental Exam is not required for placement purposes. It is intended for students who have completed at least two years of biology in high school. Plan to take this test during orientation. Even if you took the AP test you may take this exam; IUB will accept the better of the two scores. If you pass the Biology Exam you will get credit for BIOL-L 111 and/or L 112. You may read about these courses in the \"Course Descriptions\" section of this Guide. 8 University Division Guide 2010-2011 Even if you do earn credit for one or both of these courses from this exam or the AP exam, you are allowed to enroll in them. You may wish to take these courses if you are preparing for medical school or another health profession program. Some medical schools and health professions programs will not accept test credit toward admission requirements, and college-level coursework is the preferred way to prepare for admissions exams such as the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT). If you miss the Biology Departmental Exam during orientation, you can take it on Wednesday of the first week of the semester if you sign up in Jordan Hall A 115 in the week before the exam is scheduled. Check your Welcome Week schedule for details. Calculus Advanced Placement T est The Calculus Advanced Placement Test is designed for students who have already studied calculus and plan to continue. If you have completed a strong, one-year high school calculus course, plan to take this test during orientation. If you score well, you can move ahead in mathematics without needless duplication of work. Read the course descriptions for MATH-M 212, MATH-M 213 and MATH-S 212 in the \"Course Descriptions\" section of this Guide. To prepare for the Advanced Calculus Placement Test, review material from your high school calculus course(s). Bring a #2 pencil to the exam. Calculators are prohibited. Students earning a score of 17, 18, or 19 out of 24 on the Calculus Advanced Placement Test are eligible to take MATH-M 213 and will be awarded credit for MATH-M 211 if they earn an A or B in MATH-M 213. With a score of 20 or higher on this test, students automatically earn credit for MATH-M 211 with a grade of S. OTHER OPTIONAL PLACEMENT/EXEMPTION EXAMS Other opportunities to \"test out\" of college courses in chemistry , music theory , or political science will be offered during Welcome Week in August and during the first weeks of the fall term. For more detailed information about these and other exams, go to New Students on the UD website, choose New Student Orientation and click on Placement Exams (ud.iub.edu/fs_placement_exams.php). What if I already have some college credits? You are responsible for providing your orientation advisor with accurate and complete information on any tests or courses you have taken or are currently taking that yield college credit. This information is essential for your advisor to guide you appropriately in your course selection and to avoid duplication of credits already earned. On part 2 of the APW list any AP , International Baccalaureate, or SAT II exams you have taken and the scores you earned. If you have scores pending, note this. Also list any courses for which you received college level credit and the grades you earned. This includes IU's Advance College Project (ACP) courses, dual credit, or any other college courses. Go to SAT II, AP , IB Articulation on the New Student section of the UD website at ud.iub.edu/fs_ap_ib.php for details on credits earned through tests. What if I am a transfer student? If you are a transfer student go online to New Students on the UD website, choose New Student Orientation and click on Transfer and Intercampus Transfer Students (ud.iub.edu/fs_student_orientation.php). There you will find additional information on how to prepare for advising at orientation including what to bring, how credits transfer, degree requirements, important UD policies, and the transition to IUB.Part I Preparing for Advising & Registration 9 What majors, minors, and certificate programs are available at IUB? IUB offers coursework in a wide variety of disciplines. As a college student, you will study one area\u2014your major\u2014in depth. Most majors require completion of 27-42 credit hours in a specific academic field. You also have the opportunity to add breadth to your degree with minors and certificates. Most minors require completion of 15-18 credit hours, while most certificates require 21-25 credits. Adding breadth to your degree will enhance your graduation credentials and expand your career opportunities. In most cases you don't need to declare a major in your first semester, but you are encouraged to begin exploring your academic options right from the start. Although your University Division advisor can help you identify fields of study that could be a good fit for you based on your interests, skills, aptitudes, and goals, you will need to do some groundwork. Begin now by reviewing the following chart, which shows you a complete list (in alphabetical order) of all the majors, minors, and certificates available at IUB. Many academic departments that offer a major also offer a minor or certificate with the same name. In addition, there are a number of other minors and certificates in more unique fields of study . (1) As you review the chart, identify any fields of study of potential interest of you. (2) Read in more detail about individual programs of interest in the e-Guide to Schools and Majors (ud.iub.edu/fs_eguide.php). (3) On part 5 of your Academic Planning Worksheet (APW) list the majors, minors, and certificates you would like to discuss in your orientation advising appointment. (4) After identifying programs of interest, review the recommended first courses. The courses on this list will provide you with an introduction to the major, minor, or certificate and will, in most cases, also fulfill a degree requirement in that program. (5) Read the course descriptions in this booklet for each course listed for the majors, minors, and certificates you are considering. (6) In part 6 of the APW list any of these courses that you would be interested in taking during your first semester.

(Fall, Spring) (A&H) McElroy This class combines two standard aims: (1) to help students develop their writing skills; and (2) to encourage them to read carefully. At the same time, A 141 offers something unusual: students encounter African American authors of recognized ability whose skillfully crafted statements often are neglected in similar courses. The theme of the course emphasizes the link between the \"power\" of the word and the quest for social justice. Before students finish the course, they will see a clear relationship between their ability to express themselves in writing and their own prospects as shapers of human destiny. Although A 141 and A 142 do not count toward the major, completion of the A 141 and A 142 sequence fulfills the composition requirement and provides A&H distribution credit in the College of Arts and Sciences. Most students enroll in the full sequence, but students may enroll in either A 141 or A 142. A 150 Survey of the Culture of Black Americans (3 cr.)

Topics (Spring): Ananse as an African Folk Hero , Gumboot Dance: Beauty from Pain, Mande Cinema , and An Introduction to Zulu Culture L 202 Occultism in Africa (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) Adu-Amankwah Belief in the occult has been solidly established as a universal dimension of human experience. Occultism is often thought of as only witchcraft and magic, but the spectrum of the occult is broad enough to cover aspects of what might otherwise be termed religion. This course examines the concept of the occult, identifying some of the major forms it takes among Africans of sub-Saharan Africa, and exploring its power and influence within this world region. At the end of the course students will have an understanding of occult practices in Course Descriptions: Anthropology (ANTH) 25 Africa and the major role they play in traditional society. Students enrolling in the course must be willing to set aside their preconceptions about paranormal claims.

Akan (LING) See \"Foreign Languages.\" American Studies (AMST) A 100 What is America? (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (A&H) Inouye (Fall) Class will explore ideas about citizenship, national identity, and the social contract in the broader Americas. What makes us \"Americans\"? How do we define \"America\"? How does national identity compete with, or relate to, other forms of identity, such as social status or class, religious association, gender and sexuality, and racial or ethnic description? A 200 Comparative American Identities (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (A&H) Inouye (Spring) Examines the formation of legal, social, cultural, and economic identities within the United States and within U.S. controlled territories.

(Fall, Spring) (S&H) Schoenemann, Sept What made us human? The story of our past can be found in clues from various sources\u2014everything from details of DNA to evocative murals in Ice Age caves. This is why the scientific quest for human origins requires the curiosity of a philosopher coupled with the skills of a skeptical detective. This course will introduce you to the study of human evolution, a branch of anthropology that seeks to understand human uniqueness by studying the human past using scientific methods from both biological and social perspectives. We can learn a lot about ourselves by studying the behavior of living primates, like chimpanzees. And we can look at fossils and archaeological sites for the evidence that reveals when and where humans first began to behave like \"odd animals,\" walking upright, eating and cooking unusual foods, inventing tools and art, speaking languages, and enjoying social and cultural practices that we consider so \"human\" today. A 200 Topics in Anthropology: Bizarre Foods (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Atalay Pork brains, coffee from digested bat feces, and deep-fried turtle\u2014these are some of the items on the menu for our examination of delicacies, meals and manners, food taboos, cooking methods, and other cultural engagements with food. The simple acts surrounding eating are intricately linked to culture, identity, politics, economics, and so much more. In this course we will examine such linkages as we address some of the major issues facing anthropology today, including inequalities, diversity, and identities; class and gender positions; ritual and religion; the environment; globalization and culture change. This course also involves looking at the bizarre foods in our own backyard\u2014you will learn about the ingredients of a Twinkie, the production of meat, and how bread and wine turn into \"body and blood.\" We will think about fasting, starvation, and food as art, and explore the ways that people from Indiana to India are working to preserve their food cultures.

This course prepares students for more advanced courses in bioanthropology. E 101 Ecology and Society (3 cr.) (Spring) (S&H) T ucker E 105 Culture and Society (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (S&H) Brondizio, Suslak The world is full of groups of people who speak different languages; eat, dress, and worship differently; and have different ideas about health and sickness, life and death, adolescence and old age. In today's complex world of rapid cultural change and globalization, it is essential for all of us to understand the nature of the similarities and differences found among human groups. This course is a general introduction to the field of social and cultural anthropology. The course will analyze such activities as economic and political behavior, religion, arts, social organization, and thought processes. Illustrations will be drawn from cultures throughout the United States and the world. E 200 Social and Cultural Anthropology (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (S&H) Sterling, Buggenhogen Contemporary international migrations and communications are bringing us into direct contact with peoples of many regions and different values and ways of life. We are faced with the challenge of understanding other cultural perspectives in order to deal with the realities of ethnic nationalism, religious fundamentalism, and other forces that are shaping the world we live in. In this course we will explore what sociocultural anthropology can contribute to this understanding. E 208 Global Jazz, Reggae, and Hip-Hop: African Diasporic Music Beyond the African Diaspora (3 cr.) (Spring) (A&H) Sterling E 210 Rethinking Race Globally (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Greene Who invented the term \"race\" and what does it mean? Is race a legitimate way to talk about human diversity? If so, with what social and scientific understanding? If not, what other terms might we employ to substitute or complement discussions regarding racial matters? In this course we seek to address these broad questions about human diversity in terms of the legacy of the concept of race. To do so we will identify how anthropology and related disciplines have played a fundamental role in shaping our understanding about physical variation, culture, gender, and language as means to talk about differences in the human species. We will also identify the multiple ways in which such academic thought 26 University Division Guide 2010-2011 has fundamentally misconceived human difference in order to perpetuate stereotypes, justify various forms of domination, and propagate simple misunderstandings instead of recognizing the complex interactions that exist between physical variation and social constructions of human difference. We will examine ideas from past and present and read about current cases from different parts of the globe. E 212 The Anthropology of Youth and Adolescence (3 cr.) (Spring) (S&H) Suslak E 260 Culture, Health, and Illness (3 cr.) (Spring) (S&H) Phillips L 200 Language and Culture (3 cr.) (Spring) (S&H) LeSourd P 200 Introduction to Archaeology (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (S&H) King, Sievert Surveys the history, techniques, methods, goals, data base, and theoretical orientation of anthropological archaeology; is concerned primarily with how archaeology is done; and is designed for sophomore-level students with no previous background in the field. It provides a broad background to anthropological archaeology and serves as a prerequisite to more advanced courses in archaeology. Lab sections provide hands-on training with archaeological materials. P 240 Archaeology and the Movies (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Sievert . This is a course for students who are drawn to films about archaeologists or Egyptian mummies, but who question the interpretations of ancient people and of archaeologists that the movies present. We will look at how archaeologists are depicted (usually as glamorous adventurers like Indiana Jones and Lara Croft) and compare this with the work that archaeologists actually do. We will address modern issues such as looting, exploitation, and antiquities trade, and see how artifacts can have lives of their own. One theme that recurs in such films is the romance of discovery as archaeologists retrieve ancient materials from archaeological sites. Where does this impression derive from, and how does it compare to the actual activities of real (not reel) archaeologists? Another theme is site devastation, which we will evaluate in all its metaphorical glory. Film genres include romantic comedy, drama, sci fi, and even anim\u00e9.

Arabic (NELC) See \"Foreign Languages.\" Asian American Studies (AAST) A 101 Introduction to Asian American Studies (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) In this course we will study Asian American history from the nineteenth century through the present; in the process, we will also explore the diversity of groups brought under the umbrella of \"Asian American.\" Readings covering a series of major events in the collective experience of Asian immigrants and their American-born descendants will be supplemented with the more personal accounts that are offered through poetry, fiction, personal essays, and/or film. These texts, which will touch on \"Gold Mountain\" and Manzanar, Yoko Ono and Vincent Chin, may serve as springboards into discussions not only about immigration, exclusion, and racial stereotyping, but also about the mainstreaming of things Asian, like sushi and curry, and the cultural/familial expectations and conflicts a \"hyphenated American\" must often negotiate. Students will be given opportunities, both individually and in groups, to explore these issues within the broader context of American culture and to trace the line from this aspect of our shared past into the present. A 300 Topics in Asian American Studies (3 cr.) (Fall) Wong Topic: Being Asian Americans: Challenges of Identity and Adjustment This introductory survey addresses issues of Asian American ethnicity, culture, and race as they relate to mental health, psychopathology, and psychotherapy. Readings are drawn primarily from cross-cultural, clinical, and counseling psychology. Students will critically examine: (1) models of psychopathology; (2) the interplay of Asian American cultural, racial, and mental health variables; and (3) the relevance of psychotherapeutic models and other mental health services to Asian American populations. Developing the ability to reflect critically on these issues will enhance students' future effectiveness as culturally sensitive professionals serving the needs of multicultural populations. This course will be particularly relevant to students interested in the helping professions, e.g., social work, teaching, counseling, psychology, and psychiatry. A 300 Topics in Asian American Studies (3 cr.) (Fall) Inouye Topic: Playing with Difference: Popular Cultures of Asia in America From anim \u00e9 and General Tso's Chicken to henna tattoos and Hindu figurines, Asian themes and styles have become integral to the American popular cultural landscape. Everywhere you turn, the increasing presence of Asian housewares, fashion, video games, and music has transformed vernacular culture from Leave it to Beaver into something much less localized and into something more transnational and hybrid. In this course, we begin with a brief history of the mostly negative representations of Asians and Asian Americans in the mainstream media in the United States. We will then examine the popularization of aspects of Asian culture in America. Examples of topics include Hong Kong cinema, graphic novels, the spread of Asian ingredients and recipes, video games, martial arts, anim \u00e9, and yoga. The emphasis in this course lies on the changing representation, and thus reception and conception, of Asians and Asian cultures in American popular media. Meets with AMST-A 350.

See your advisor for details on these courses and for restrictions on repeating courses for credit. Topics course goals are to promote critical thinking and effective, cogent oral and written communication among entering college students; to instill awareness, understanding, and appreciation of human diversity; and to broaden students' understanding of, and appreciation for, areas outside their fields of specialization. Topics courses are of moderate size (approximately 100 students) and are taught by faculty. For more information about College of Arts and Sciences Topics courses, please visit the Topics website: www.indiana.edu/~bulletin/iub/ coas/special.html#topic. Topics courses are open to all students. Students 30 University Division Guide 2010-2011 can receive credit for only one version of each specific course. For example, even though individual topics vary, a student may receive credit only once for enrolling in COLL-E 103. See advisor for details. FALL TERM OPTIONS COLL-E 103 TOPICS IN ARTS AND HUMANITIES Descriptions: E 103 Conceptions of the Self: East and West (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Stalnaker It is a truism that different cultures propound different visions of human life. This course examines important statements on the nature of human existence from the ancient and modern West and from East Asia, and endeavors to sensitively compare these diverse visions of human life without capitulating to nihilism, relativism, or self- satisfied cultural chauvinism. Traditions we will examine include Confucianism, Daoism, Christianity, Marxism, and contemporary democratic political theory. Recurring issues include the character and relation of reason and emotions; the nature and source of saving dispositions; understandings of the relation of our more animal and more human sides; problems in life that are thought to deform the self; the need, if any, for transcendent forces to actualize the self; the form of and rationale for various practices of self-cultivation; and the relation of individual and communal flourishing. All readings are in English translation. E 103 The Ebonics Controversy (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Davis This course deals with the controversy concerning Ebonics (African American Vernacular English). The controversy has several different aspects which impact social, educational, and linguistic issues. The class takes an academic perspective on the topic as we examine and try to understand various aspects of the controversy. What is Ebonics? Is it a separate language, a dialect, slang, bad grammar, or really not a distinct entity? Are its origins traceable to the language systems of Africa, or is it a variant of Southern English? How do different people in society view Ebonics and why do they have those views? Finally, there is a practical question of how to approach the education of African American children whose home speech is Ebonics. Should a goal in the education of these children be the purging of Ebonics so that it does not interfere with the mastery of mainstream English, or should Ebonics be used as a vehicle for learning mainstream English? This course deals with these and other issues through readings, films, group discussions, writing assignments, and lectures. E103 Great Wall of China (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Atwood Why was the Great Wall of China built? What made the two peoples of China and Mongolia so hostile that a vast wall had to be built to separate them? Is this wall a symbol of China's might and glory, or a symbol of tyranny like the Berlin wall? Did the wall actually keep out the \"barbarians\"? Can it really be seen from the moon? For almost 2,000 years, how to handle the nomads of Mongolia was the most important foreign policy question for China's rulers. At several different times and several different places from the third century B.C. to the twentieth century A.D., they used walls to defend themselves from the nomads. The wall thus came to symbolize the social, economic, military, political, and cultural clash between China and Mongolia. Across this frontier, nomads and Chinese fought, but also traded, exchanged diplomatic missions, and made peace. In understanding this conflict, students will explore fundamental issues of international relations. E103 King Arthur of Britain: The Once and Future Hero (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) McGerr Who was King Arthur? When and where do the narratives about him first appear? Is he a conquering hero or a tragic victim of personal betrayal? What do the narratives of King Arthur have to do with the quest for the Holy Grail? What mythological, literary, and political forces have shaped representations of King Arthur in the past and in our own times? This course examines major narratives about King Arthur from medieval Europe and compares them to some of the most famous representations of King Arthur in the literature and films of the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries. Readings will include the medieval Welsh tale \"How Culhwch Won Olwen,\" the medieval Latin chronicle \"The History of the Kings of Britain,\" the medieval French tale \"The Knight of the Cart,\" the medieval German tale \"Parzival,\" the medieval English tale \"Morte D'Arthur,\" Alfred Lord Tennyson's \"Idylls of the King,\" and the English novel \"The Once and Future King.\" Films studied will be \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" (1974), \"Excalibur\" (1981), and \"King Arthur\" (2004). E103 Language and Thought (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Franks This course examines the nature of human language from a variety of perspectives and explores the complex interrelationship between language and thought. It introduces students to current language-related issues in the social and behavioral sciences, addressing questions such as: How is human language structured? What does it mean to \"know\"a language? How is this knowledge acquired? What happens when linguistic ability is impaired? To what extent are language and thought independent? Is language a uniquely human capacity? How can human languages differ? What properties do they all share? What are sign languages? How do languages change? Readings: S. Pinker, The Language Instinct ; F. Parker & K. Riley, Linguistics for Non-Linguists : A Primer with Exercises , and various articles (t.b.a.). The honors discussion will be run by the professor. (The three regular discussions will be run by an AI.) Honors students will be assigned extra topical readings and will be required, in addition to completing the regular homework assignments and exams, to write a short paper. E103 Philosophical Reflections on Religion and Evolution (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) O'Connor This course will invite students to reflect philosophically on the relationship between the accepted frameworks of biological and cosmic evolution and monotheistic religious doctrines of creation, fall, and survival of death. We will begin by considering the nature of scientific evidence and theory confirmation and the relationship of faith and reason. We will then discuss whether and how specific religious claims are compatible with contemporary scientific accounts of the origin of the universe and of living systems on earth, including human beings. We will also look at recent speculative theories concerning the evolutionary origin of religion, and ask what, if anything, the truth of some such theory would mean for the truth of any particular set of religious claims. Throughout, students will be exposed to historical reactions of religious thinkers to scientific theories and to the religious views of scientists, past and present. The goal of the course is not to persuade students of the correctness of any particular view on these matters, but to equip them to make informed and critical judgments of their own. E103 Power, Politics, and Piety: The Struggle for the Holy Land (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Magid This course will examine the political situation in Israel/Palestine from historical, theological, and cultural perspectives with special emphasis on nationalism and territorialism. We will read primary and secondary literature dealing with modern nationalism and territory, the concept of \"land\" in Judaism and Islam, the history of Zionism and Palestinian Nationalism, and the rise of the anti-nationalist Islamist movement including its roots in British colonialism. We will explore the rise of nationalism in the Middle East more generally including its secular, Marxist, and Islamist roots; and will read some classical and contemporary Zionist debates on bi- nationalism, militarism, territorial compromise, and the more contemporary discussion in Israel and Palestine in the media and in the academy. This is not a political science course\u2014 meaning we will not debate policy, legislation, and predictions for the future. Rather, we will examine the underlying theological and cultural roots of the political crisis founded on the relationship between territory and national identity. E103 A Question of Love (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Mickel In this topics course, we shall explore our understanding of the various emotions and relationships we cover by the word love. As a basis for understanding the different aspects of love in human relationships as represented in western tradition, we shall read and analyze an anthology of fundamental passages from several classical and medieval works, ranging from Plato and the Bible to Ovid and the Romance of the Rose . We shall use our discussion of these texts to analyze the representations of love in two medieval romances, Chretien's Erec and Enide and Gottfried's Tristan , one one eighteenth-century French novel, The Princess of Cleves and Dangerous Liaisons , and an English novel by Jane Austen, Sense and Sensibility. E103 Sacred Places (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Gruber In most parts of the world, religious activity is linked to specific places which have ritual, Course Descriptions: College of Arts and Sciences Topics Courses (COLL) 31 mythical, or historical significance. These \"sacred spaces\" become the focus of ritual activity, pilgrimage, and symbolism, and are usually endowed with buildings and art that celebrate the sanctity of the place, create a sense of awe, and accommodate the activities and people who travel to visit them. This course offers an introduction to a representative sample of significant sacred sites and shrines throughout the world. These holy places will be examined in terms of the festivals and religions with which they are associated: Egyptian, Greek, and Mesoamerican religions, Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Shinto. We will look at why the selected sites became holy to certain peoples or civilizations, how the sites and structures convey a sense of transcendence and awe, how the structures were planned to accommodate assembled groups of persons and the attendant festivals and rituals, the nature of the processions of the faithful to them, the symbolic meaning of these sites, and whether their functions and significance have survived to the present day unaltered or in a reconfigured form. Course requirements include five short (1-2 page) papers, a midterm, a final exam, and a final written project. COLL-E 104 TOPICS IN SOCIAL AND HISTORICAL STUDIES Descriptions: E104 Brains and Minds, Robots, and Computers (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Hullinger This course introduces topics in the Cognitive Sciences. As a survey course, it touches on all aspects of this interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving field. The course addresses topics such as the mind and brain, artificial intelligence, embodied cognition, cyborgs, robotics, social interactions and complex systems, the wisdom of crowds, social foraging, and the representation of knowledge. Special units may involve topics such as Mindstorms, Robotics, and video games in society. This course is not an explicit prerequisite for 200- and 300- level Cognitive Science courses, but serves as an introduction to the field and is recommended for students who are considering a Cognitive Science major or minor. E104 Genetics, Eugenics, and Biotechnology (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Gliboff This course is a history of the science of genetics, of scientists' visions for improving the human condition, and of the interplay between the two. It will show how developments in the laboratory not only helped to inspire the humanistic visions but also drew inspiration from them. Topics will include the life and work of Gregor Mendel, early Mendelism, ideas and policies for eugenics and racial hygiene, the rise of molecular genetics and biotechnology, and its real and promised applications. E104 Global Consumer Culture (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Wilk Is the planet going to become one big shopping mall, full of people who listen to the same music and watch the same movies? Or is the world entering a period of tribalism and fundamentalism, as nations break apart and everyone scrambles for their own piece of territory? Scholars simply don't agree. One thing is clear: consumer culture\u2014lives built around the media, celebrities, mass-produced goods, and shopping malls\u2014is spreading everywhere. Can the earth sustain seven billion consumers, their cars, refrigerators, and appetites? Many ecologists don't think so. Does the spread of consumer culture mean the end of cultural, religious, and linguistic diversity, of families and communities? Would anyone want to live in a world where Indianapolis, Tokyo, Bombay, and Paris looked, sounded, and tasted the same? This course will examine the evidence for the spread of global consumer culture, looking at the ways that people around the world have learned to be consumers. We will ask the tough questions about the future, about the environmental impacts of consumption, and the way our own cups of coffee and running shoes tie us together with a whole globe of other producers and consumers. E104 Islam, Oil, and Geopolitics (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Bovingdon The sudden collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 focused new attention on the resource-rich and multi-ethnic states of Central Asia. The September 11 attacks made clear that political Islam and state collapse were regional problems with global implications. This course will introduce students to the history and modern politics of \"greater Central Asia,\" focusing on the Turco-Iranian countries stretching from Azerbaijan to Kazakhstan but including Afghanistan, Pakistan, and northwest China's Turkic and Islamic Xinjiang region as well. The course opens with the Russian conquest and the Anglo-Russian \"Great Game,\" then focuses on individual countries with guest lectures by regional experts. The course will examine trans-border or regional issues (post-socialist economic transition, disputes over energy, water, etc.), and close with global currents such as Islamism and the post-Cold War rivalries among Russia, China, and the United States. E104 The Mad and the Bad (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Dwyer What are the problems of those with long-term mental illnesses? What happens when they get caught up in the criminal justice system? This course draws on materials from psychology, sociology, law, and criminal justice to answer these questions. It focuses first on the experience, diagnosis, and treatment of serious illnesses such as schizophrenia and then at how the criminal justice system responds to them. We pay special attention to how people move (and are moved) back and forth between jails and hospitals, prisons and psychiatric units, the community and social control institutions. Typically, students read several first-hand accounts of mental illness, written by patients and those who care for them. We also read articles about the criminal justice system and the mentally ill, focusing on issues such as the insanity defense, police handling of the mentally ill, serial killers, and violent sexual offender legislation. Assignments include a short paper and two or three examinations. COLL-E 104 Religion and Revolutions (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Cipa This course raises the central questions concerning the struggle between the received dogma of religion, and freedom of thought and conscience, by focusing on issues such as: views of the 18th century on Man, religion, and reason; efforts of 19th century thinkers such as Marx, Comte, Durkheim, Weber to change society in a more \"rational\" direction; role of the French Revolution in bringing down the traditional underpinnings of European society; Russian Revolution and the development of the Marxist position on religion; the Turkish secularist revolution and the destruction of the Ottoman Empire; India and Sri Lanka: Hinduism and Buddhism; Iranian Civilization and Iranian Revolution; Huntington's concept of the \"Clash of Civilizations.\"Among the questions we will be dealing with are: Is it possible to have a \"secular\" world? Is it still possible to have a unified \"religious\" vision? What is the relationship of \"religion\" to a \"secular\" state or to a \"secular\" public? How can religious traditions relate to each other, in a constructive and creative fashion, without descending into violence, at a time when they are obliged to come into closer and more intimate relations with each other than ever before? You are also required to write a research paper (10-12 pages) on a topic of interest in the course, concentrating on subjects or regions of your choice. E104 Rise and Fall of Civilization (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) King About 10,000 years ago, human societies in several areas of the world and on separate continents began to undergo a series of major transformations. In each case, small groups of hunters and gatherers settled into the world's first farming villages. From these villages arose bigger towns, and eventually large and complex urban civilizations. How and why did these changes take place? What can the similarities and differences in each case tell us about the process of culture change? What do cycles of rise, expansion, and collapse say about the inevitability or likelihood of such changes occurring in human societies? How do we define civilization and the state? What do we learn and what do we miss by focusing on large-scale cultural transformations? We will address these questions through an introductory survey of ancient civilizations in five regions: the Near East, Egypt, and South Asia in the Old World, and Mesoamerica and South America in the New World. We will focus on the Sumerian, Egyptian, Indus, Maya, Aztec, and Inca civilizations. Lectures, readings, and discussions describe and compare these civilizations, and consider the ways in which the environment, technology, trade, warfare, religious beliefs, and other phenomena shaped their growth and decline. This course will introduce students to the ways in which major issues in archaeology are investigated and debated. By examining competing points of view, students will learn about the challenges of creating arguments based on archaeological data and will learn how to differentiate between fact and inference. In written assignments, quizzes, and discussion sections, students will be asked to develop their own interpretations and present arguments and data to support them. There will be two lectures and one discussion section per week. Course grades will be determined by attendance, participation, a combination of writing assignments and quizzes, and two exams (a mid-32 University Division Guide 2010-2011 term and a final). E104 What Makes it Jewish? (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Cohen This course is designed to introduce students to the study of culture as social practice, framed within the context of Jewish life. Ideas about how people perceive and respond to history will serve as an important part of our discussion; our focus, however, will be on how societies bring these ideas of history and \"tradition\" together within contemporary activities and on debates surrounding Judaism in order to lead meaningful lives. COLL-E 105 TOPICS IN NATURAL AND MATHEMATICAL SCIENCE Descriptions: E105 The Biology of Food (3 cr.) (Fall) (N&M) Bonner The most intimate relationship people have with other organisms is to eat them. We kill animals, plants, and microbes, put them into our mouths, break them down into components, and then build them into our own bodies. We literally are what we eat. However, so few of us raise our own food that even these close relationships are invisible. For example, what do you know about the life of a chicken, a cow, or an orange tree? Where do they live, what processes regulate their lives, and how does their use as human food affect them and us? The knowledge of how eating, a daily act, connects you with other organisms will give you the information necessary to appreciate and control these interactions in a more meaningful way. By studying how organisms we use as food evolve, grow, reproduce, and interact, we will study many basic principles of biology. Among the foods we will study are milk, eggs, meat, vegetables, fruits, fermented products, and chocolate. On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen , by Harold McGee, provides background reading, supplemented with handouts. Students will write a paper on a topic of their choice, participate in class discussions about current food controversies, and analyze their own diets. There will also be three exams. E105 Physics for Poets (3 cr.) (Fall) (N&M) Carini This course explores some of the biggest ideas in physics with an emphasis on their historical development, experimental verification, and impact on society as a whole. During this course we will follow the progression of our understanding of space and time from Aristotle to Einstein. E105 Read My Lips (3 cr.) (Fall) (N&M) Lentz Have you ever noticed that, in difficult listening conditions, you can often better understand the person talking to you if you can see the talker? This is a common occurrence and is typically referred to as lipreading or speechreading. Speechreading benefits all sighted people, including those with good hearing and those with profound hearing losses, because of the relationship between lip movements and the speech signals received by our ears.To develop this skill, people possess a neural system capable of combining information received by the ears and the eyes. This course will review the effects of visual information on auditory sensation with special emphasis on the particular aspects of sound and visual images that are useful for communication. The impact of deafness and blindness on the typical or normal neural representations of sound and visual images in the brain will also be discussed. The course will also include presentations on the nature of the benefits of speech reading for the deaf and hard of hearing. E105 The Scientific Revolution (3 cr.) (Fall) (N&M) Bertoloni Meli The course describes key episodes in the transformation of knowledge about nature in the Renaissance and 17th century. The course focuses on methods of inquiry (mathematics, anatomy, and the role of scientific experiment) as well as on major figures.

Collins Living-Learning Center (CLLC) Many unique academic opportunities are featured at the CLLC, and participation in them is part of the center's community life. Collins offers seminars handpicked by a committee of students. The student-taught Q 199 Residential Learning workshop is mandatory for all freshmen entering Collins. In addition, all freshmen and sophomores are required to take a Collins seminar each year; juniors and seniors are encouraged to enroll in one Collins course a year. These courses encourage critical thinking, creative activity, and community building and are open to most IU students. Most Collins courses fulfill College of Arts and Sciences distribution requirements. See the Collins Website (www. indiana.edu/~llc) for more information. Q 199 Residential Learning Workshop (1 cr.) (Fall, Spring) Peer Instructors Challenges you to engage the core values of the Collins community: academics, diversity, community, empowerment, and sustainable living, through readings, discussion, and activities. Course Descriptions: Communication and Culture (CMCL) 33 An experienced peer instructor, who is also a Collins resident, facilitates the class. It helps you integrate into the Collins, IU, and Bloomington communities. You'll learn how to take advantage of the resources of a living-learning center situated in a major research university through a range of hands-on experiences, including a community project of your own. L 100 Astronomical Knowledge: From the Nebra Sky Disk to the Copernican system (2 cr.) (Fall) (First eight weeks) B\u00fcttner The course aims to provide an introductory outline of the history of astronomy from the earliest astronomical observations to the firm establishment of the Copernican heliocentric worldview in the course of the 16th and 17th centuries. Besides familiarity with some of the major events in the history of astronomy, students should gain a better understanding of what they actually see when looking at the night sky and, optimally, after completing the course, not only be aware that many ancient civilizations used sundials, but be able to build a primitive one themselves. This course is taught by visiting scholar-in-residence Jochen B\u00fcttner, from the Max Planck Institute in Berlin, brought to IU through Collins in collaboration with the Department of History and Philosophy of Science. L 100 Edible Wild Plants (1 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (Non-standard weeks) Bertuccio We will be spending time in the outdoors observing, learning, drawing, and collecting edible wild plants. Each session will be in a different location: woods, fields, wetlands, lawns, etc. We will have the opportunity to see where these plants are growing, what their needs are, and to collect and use them in recipes. Each session will result in a recipe booklet with its own artwork and recipes, tested and tasted by the group. L 200 \"Play\"giarism as Inspiration: Creating New Works From Old (3 cr.) (Fall) Eaton This creative writing course will examine the different ways in which already-created literature can jumpstart the creative process. We will read, analyze, and discuss the work of writers who have worked with other texts to compose their own, as well as examining the works that inspired them. We'll perform a series of exercises that probe the nature of plagiarism, both in its traditional definition of literary theft, and in the definition of imitation and inspiration put forth by this course. You will create stories, poems, or prose pieces that are inspired by provided work and pieces you bring in. L 210 Collins Colloquium (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Landry Topic: A Not So Foreign Affair : Entertainment, Propaganda, and Rivalry from Hitler to Hollywood From military propaganda to romantic comedy, to hate propaganda and political parody, this course aims to explore the multifaceted ways in which different film genres have been utilized to serve political and social ideologies on a national scale. The focus will be on films produced during the WWII period, on the one hand, under the Nazi regime and, on the other hand, in Hollywood. This transatlantic framework will provide a rich scope for comparing and contrasting how cinema can function both implicitly and explicitly as a mode of propaganda. Not only will students engage with the provocative world of German and American cinema of the period, but they will also have the opportunity to think critically about the complexities of film as a unique artistic and mass medium and thereby begin to acquire essential film analysis skills. L 210 Collins Colloquium (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Cl\u00fcver Topic: Art and Community This course will explore the relationship between art, community, and service. We will examine artists who take community into consideration in their art making, discuss theories on public art and its impact on communities, examine educational approaches that focus on the nature of the teacher-pupil relationship, and practice art making techniques applicable for working with children. For the service component of the course we will mentor children in K-8 classes at The Project School in Bloomington. The goal is to hone the children's visual and literacy skills through art projects, and for IU students to gain experience working with children through this particular school's philosophy of involving the arts in the overall educational process. L 210 Collins Colloquium (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Peters-Golden Topic: The Graphic Novel: Redrawing Boundaries and Rewriting Conventions Graphic novels wed art, literature, and popular culture in a way that forces many critics to rethink the idea that they are less complex, less culturally relevant, and of less value than \"real\" literature. This course takes the graphic novel as its object of study: we will examine the history from which it develops, its formal construction, its themes, and its concerns. The class also uses graphic novels as a way to ask questions about the ways literature and art can represent, affect, and explain the histories and cultures that produce them. We will work through many themes that are essential to graphic novels (alienation, gender, sexualities, race, class, violence, history, high/low culture) and conclude with a study of the recent upswell in filmic adaptations of graphic novels. Assignments will vary from informal responses to historical research, and from analytical writing to creative projects. L 210 Collins Colloquium (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Robson Topic: Singing and Dancing America: American Society, Culture, and Politics through Stage and Screen Musicals The American musical comedy has endured for well over a century, adapting to meet the shifting needs and tastes of the American public. As such, the musical affords us an opportunity to examine these shifting audience perspectives. How have musicals, both on stage and on screen, challenged societal assumptions and prejudices over their lifespan? Through reading and screening musicals from both stage and screen, this course asks students to analyze these reflections of societal concerns and values. Course assignments will include weekly online responses, one research paper, one presentation, and an end-of-semester final project. Artwork is often a strong window into the beliefs of a society, yet the musical has often been derided as too frivolous for study. This course will capitalize on the very popularity that causes scholars to dismiss the musical to show how the form reveals a great deal about American culture. L 220 Collins Colloquium (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Harrison Topic: The Politics of Reproduction This course will examine the relationship between gender, birth, and power. Lectures, readings, and class discussion will consider the context in which contemporary ideologies of reproduction have emerged, and how these ideologies take shape and change through time. We will ask questions about gender, class, race, and sexuality\u2014for example: Are pregnancy and childbirth always positive experiences for women? Historically, what means have been employed to encourage or discourage certain populations in the United States from bearing children? How do new reproductive technologies impact cultural norms of reproduction, and to what extent? How might sexuality impact one's reproductive choices? We will address these questions from an interdisciplinary perspective, drawing on feminist theory, history, literature, sociology, and queer theory. In addition, the course will engage with popular media sources such as television, advertising, and film. L 220 Collins Colloquium (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Kerchner Topic: Video Killed the Radio Star: Music Television and the 1980s This course uses anthropology and folklore to explore music videos as cultural texts which offer insight into how such formal constructs are produced and consumed, as well as the role of gender, drugs and alcohol, national events, politics, globalization of popular culture, and economics have on their formation and their impact in society. Upon completion of the course, students will have acquired the conceptual and methodological tools for conducting ethnographic analyses of visual materials as information-dense artifacts that can be explored and understood through social science. The majority of videos will be from the 1980s. However, the last quarter of the semester will focus on those from subsequent decades so as to enable students to understand how videos as an art form have evolved. Communication and Culture (CMCL) C 121 Public Speaking (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring, Summer) A contemporary course in the ancient and practical art of rhetoric founded on the premise that rhetorical action (including the focus of our course, public speaking) is public action. The course is designed to help you recognize situations in which your rhetorical action can contribute to the well-being of a community. C 121 provides you with the tools (both of speech composition and delivery) you need to responsibly prepare a variety of effective presentations. Each assignment and speech is an opportunity to engage a rhetorical situation in order to l) create an audience out of a collection 34 University Division Guide 2010-2011 of individuals; and 2) invite that audience to understand something in a particular way or motivate its members to help resolve some problem about which you think they should be concerned. C 122 Interpersonal Communication (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring, Summer) (S&H) This course is an introduction to interpersonal communication, examined from the intersecting perspectives of performance, power, and identity. Performance highlights our central concern with the practice of interpersonal communication in the conduct of social life, through which the most resonant symbols and beliefs of a society are embodied, enacted, and placed on display. You and your classmates will be asked to become ethnographers of interpersonal everyday conversation. You will observe and analyze interpersonal interactions in your own lives in the light of an array of communication concepts and theories. In the end, we will encourage you not only to analyze others' communication, but also to use the theoretical principles you learn to become more aware of how your interpersonal interactions with others are connected to broader questions of power and social identity. C 190 Introduction to Media (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring, Summer) (A&H) References to the power and prevalence of \"the media\" are commonplace. But what are \"the media\"? How do they work and for whom? As media increasingly pervade the fabric of daily life, and as fewer and fewer entities dominate media ownership, the urgency of asking and answering these questions only grows in importance. This course will introduce you to the basic vocabularies of visual and media literacy and hone your skills at critically analyzing media texts, institutions, apparatuses, and audiences. We will focus on four specific (and prevalent) media genres\u2014film, radio, television, and the Internet\u2014and our goal will be to explore the relationships between and among form, content, ownership, and meaning with respect to each. C 201 Race and the Media (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (S&H) Explores the ways in which U.S. ideologies in particular historical periods have influenced the production, representations, and audiences' interpretations of media artifacts. Topics might focus on specific or various ethnic groups (e.g., African Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos, \"Whites\") and mainstream and/or alternative media. Screenings may be required. C 202 Media in the Global Context (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (S&H) Surveys media industries, products, and publics outside the United States context (e.g., Asia, Africa, Europe, Latin America). Analyzes regional media in relation to local/global historical, economic, and social processes. C 203 Gender, Sexuality, and the Media (3 cr.) (Spring) (S&H) C 204 Topics in Media Culture and Society (3cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Topics: Performances of Human/Nature Defining Relationships with the Environment; Sports Media. C 204 courses explore the relationship between communication media and a range of social institutions, practices, and beliefs. Course may focus on a particular medium and/or period. C 205 Introduction to Communication and Culture (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring, Summer) (A&H) This course will introduce you to the unique perspective on the study of communication provided by the combined interests and talents of the faculty in this department. This course also will prepare you for the work that will be expected in higher- level courses in the department in the areas of rhetoric and public culture, performance and ethnography, and film and media. Most important, this course encourages you to see that our social world, and the truths through which we define it, cannot exist outside of communication. In other words, it is through film, speech, and performance that we construct our world and ourselves. Understanding this perspective on communication enables students to become more productive participants in contemporary public culture. C 208 Image Cultures (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Offers an interdisciplinary and historical context for understanding contemporary western \"image culture\" by addressing the notion of the \"image\" in a wide range of its theoretical, critical, and practical contexts, uses, and history. Examines the claim that our culture is more imagistic than others historically, asking how the roles of images have changed over time in relation to other modes of signification. C 222 Democratic Deliberation (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (A&H) This course considers the challenge of participatory public discussion and decision making in our democracy. As such, this course is premised on the idea that individuals and groups are always bound up in public institutions and vocabularies that both constrain action and provide possibilities for action. C 228 Argumentation and Public Advocacy (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (A&H) Practical introduction to the use of reasoning and evidence in argumentation. Develops skills that are useful in becoming a productive citizen and that are essential for achieving success in upper- division courses across the university. C 229 Ways of Speaking (3 cr.) (Spring) (S&H) C 290 Hollywood I (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Anderson This is an introductory survey course suitable for both majors and Non-majors.

Students are expected to attend lectures and screenings of about 15 representative films, including the work of such major directors as D. W. Griffith, Alfred Hitchcock, and Billy Wilder. C 292 Hollywood II (3 cr.) (Spring) (S&H) See the Web for description: www.indiana. edu/~deanfac/class.html.Comparative Literature (CMLT) C 145-C 146 Major Characters in Literature (Fall) and Major Themes in Literature (Spring) (3 cr.) (A&H) This course helps students with any major develop their skills in reading and interpreting literary texts and in articulating their responses through written assignments and class discussion format. Students usually complete five short writing projects based on the texts discussed, for a total of 20-25 pages. C 145 and C 146 each fulfill half of the English composition requirement when the student also registers for the one credit hour of ENG-W 143. There are no additional class meetings or assignments in addition to those of C 145 and C 146. C 145 Major Characters in Literature (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Topic for Fall 2010: Crazy Couples. Meet some of the oddest couples in world literature this semester: lovers, rivals, conspirators, BFFs, as their adventures test the bonds of their relationships. All sections will read Euripides' Alcestis and Shakespeare's Two Gentlemen of Verona : a husband and wife team tries to outwit the Grim Reaper, while Shakespeare's first romantic comedy presents us with star-crossed lovers so strange that theaters refused to show the entire last act for a hundred years. Each section will read additional works unique to that section that may include short stories, poetry, and novels. Individual sections may also include television, art, music, and film. This course focuses on developing skills in critical thinking, clear communication, and persuasive composition. The workload includes three essays, mid-term and final exams, as well as shorter writing assignments. C 146 Major Themes in Literature (3 cr.) (Spring) (A&H) Topic for Spring 2011: Lost and Found. See the Web for description: www.indiana.edu/~deanfac/class.html. C 147 Images of the Self\u2014East and West (3 cr.)

(Spring) (A&H) C 255 Modern Literature and Other Arts: An Introduction (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (A&H) Intensive Writing in fall . How do a writer, a painter, and a composer represent a landscape, or silence? Is an advertisement a work of art? What do a romantic painting, poem, and symphony have in common? Can one translate a painting into a poem? How does one compare works of art created in different media, and why do we do it? What do we listen for in music or look for in a painting or a short story? These are the kinds of questions discussed in C 255, which deals with interrelations between literature, painting, and music during the past 200 years. Among the works studied are compositions by Mozart, Berlioz, Stravinsky, and John Cage; poems or stories by Coleridge, Flaubert, Joyce, Gertrude Stein, and Anne Sexton; and paintings by Delacroix, Courbet, Monet, Van Gogh, Kandinsky, and Mondrian.

(Fall, Spring, Summer) (Non-majors) (N&M) This course is centered on problem-solving techniques in computer environments. It teaches general problem- solving principles by applying them within particular software applications, such as word processing, Web browsing, and spreadsheets. The class is intended for students with little or no practical computing experience. The major objective is to acquire not only the skills of handling today's software tools, but also to gain the ability to learn new software applications as they emerge. In addition to providing instruction for each of the software applications, the lectures will examine how the computer and its various components operate and introduce some of the social and cultural implications of widespread computer use. Credit given for only one of CSCI -A 106, A 110, A 111. A 201 Introduction to Programming I (4 cr.) (Fall, Spring, Summer) (Non-majors) (N&M) P: Two years of high school algebra or MATH -M 014. Intended for students of all backgrounds and majors (except computer science) who desire an introduction to computer programming. No previous programming experience is expected. In addition to preparing students to write simple programs, this course provides an appreciation of what is \"under the hoods\" of computer systems and presents general approaches to data representation and processing. Topics include common data types, conditional evaluation, looping, functional decomposition of programs, and simple data input and output. Good programming style and effective design and debugging techniques are emphasized. Laboratory exercises and assignments develop programming skill with problems illustrative of computing in business, science, and entertainment. A 202 Introduction to Programming II (4 cr.) (Fall, Spring, Summer) (Non-majors) (N&M) P: A 201, A 304, Computer Science Advanced Placement Exam, or consent of instructor. If a student subsequently chooses to major or minor in computer science, A 201 and A 202 may be used in place of C 212 in satisfaction of a computer science core course requirement. C 211 Introduction to Computer Science (4 cr.) (Fall, Spring, Summer) (Majors) (N&M) P: High school precalculus math. A first course in computer science for those intending to take advanced computer science courses. Introduction to the design, programming, and analysis of algorithms.

This course provides an expanded and enriched treatment of the material in C 211. Credit given for only one of H 211, C 211. H 241 Discrete Structure for Computer Science, Honors (3 cr.) (Fall) (N&M) P: H 211 or C 211. Credit given for only one of H 241 or C 241 Criminal Justice (CJUS) P 100 Introduction to Criminal Justice (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring, Summer) (S&H) This course provides an overview of the modern criminal justice system. Each major decision point in the justice system will be scrutinized\u2014from detection and apprehension by the police through pretrial procedures, adjudication, and sentencing by the courts to the use of imprisonment and community correctional programs such as probation. The course will concentrate on the functions of criminal justice officials. We also will examine such issues as decriminalization, gun control, police brutality, search and seizure, right to counsel, bail reform, plea bargaining, prison riots, inmate rights, and the use of the death penalty. P 200 Theories of Crime and Deviance (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring, Summer) (S&H) This course serves as an introduction to theories of crime and its control. Issues relating to the definition and measurement of crime will be explored, followed by an examination of the biological, psychological, and sociological theories offered to explain criminality. The course will conclude with a discussion of the criminal justice policy implications that are derived from the various theories of criminality. P 202 Alternative Social Control Systems (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring, Summer) (S&H) Law is the fundamental fabric that holds our society together, while behavioral and social science allow us to study and understand human behavior. This course introduces students to the structure of American law, including its three branches of government: the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial. It unpacks law, legal systems, and legal processes; how they interact to create our systems of social control; and how behavioral and social science can be and are being used to understand human behavior within the fabric of law. Through discussion of original readings, this course allows students to appreciate why law and its alternative systems of social control are so important for non- lawyers to continuously scrutinize. P 290 The Nature of Inquiry (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (S&H) (Majors) This course has two basic goals: 1) to provide a systematic framework 36 University Division Guide 2010-2011 for increasing knowledge and understanding of criminal justice issues; and 2) to teach basic research methods in the social sciences so that students will learn to read critically and to analyze research reports, journal articles, and other relevant publications. Because P 290 introduces students to basic issues and techniques in research, and because it is a prerequisite for 400-level courses in criminal justice, we recommend that this course be taken as early as possible in a major's program. Croatian (SLA V) See \"Foreign Languages.\" Czech (SLA See also \"Foreign Languages.\" E 341 Dutch Culture: The Modern Netherlands (3 cr.) (Fall) (Second eight weeks) (S&H) Ham Topic: WW II Dutch Film and Literature. See Web for description: www.indiana. edu/~deanfac/class.html. East Asian Languages and Cultures (EALC) E 100 East Asia: An Introduction (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Robinson East Asia: traditional, crowded, poor, authoritarian, dirty, and rural. These adjectives are still used by some to describe China, Japan, and Korea, but more often we now hear others: modern, (almost) democratic, dynamic, high-tech, and urban. To what extent did East Asia formerly fit the first group of adjectives and to what extent does it now fit the latter? This course provides a broad overview of East Asia from its earliest recorded history up to the early twenty-first century. Areas covered include these countries' social structures, arts, economies, and politics. In addition to looking at their internal developments, we consider the effect that East Asia and the rest of the world have had on each other. Readings are from a textbook, literature, and the popular media. Assignments include short papers, hour exams, and a final. The course is designed for students with little to no background or knowledge of East Asia. Others are urged to begin with a 200-level survey course in their area of interest.

G 220 Global Village Colloquium (3 cr.)(Fall) (S&H) Chelekis Topic: Gender in Economic Development Did you know that there are Avon salespeople in Amazonian communities and African villages? In fact, economists, political scientists, sociologists, and anthropologists have placed increasing importance on small and micro-businesses as engines of economic development and tools for women's empowerment in developing countries. We will use the methods and theoretical concepts of anthropology to examine women's small and micro-businesses in developing countries, as well as development agencies' programs that encourage women to start small and micro- businesses.

We will read and discuss cases from South America, West Africa, India, Bangladesh, Thailand, and even the U.S. This course aims to teach students not only about economic anthropology, but how to apply this sub- discipline to real-world issues and public policy by focusing on a major trend around the world. G 220 Global Village Colloqium (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Lewis Topic: Music and Medicine in Global Perspectives Music and medicine have long been intertwined phenomena, and have recently become even more closely linked in the United States with the emergence of the fields of music therapy and the medical humanities.

Each case study will include perspectives from a number of fields, including biomedicine, ethnomusicology, anthropology, Western musicology, public health, and music therapy. In addition, our case studies will take us as far away as Malawi and Malaysia, while also including music-making from within the United States. We will examine these case studies against larger questions of efficacy in cross- cultural applications of musical therapies as well as the ways in which theoretical and disciplinary orientation affect the scope and aims of medical and musical research.

G 320 Espionage in the Twenty-First Century (3 cr.) (Spring) (S&H) Coyle G 321 Intelligence and National Security (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Coyle This course will begin with a look at the traditional role of intelligence during wartime and peacetime in American history and focus on the occasions when intelligence played a key role in the success of U.S. foreign policy and when it failed. We will then compare that to the post September 11, 2001, world and how the U.S. Intelligence Community has had to shift its tactics and emphasis to counter non- state terrorist threats. During the Cold War, the threat of massive retaliation against a nation that attacked the United States served as a deterrent to most, but when the attacker today may be only a handful of people motivated by religious, political, or even ecological reasons and willing to be suicide martyrs, this is no longer a practical strategy. The changed threat requires a greater emphasis on Human Intelligence (HUMINT) and we will examine how an American intelligence officer goes about recruiting another person to become a spy. We will also look at the civil liberty issues as the line between foreign and domestic intelligence activities has blurred in order to counter terrorist threats that have no distinction of borders. The course is taught by a 30-year veteran of the CIA.

Instead it is a course that combines conventional historical topics with unconventional themes. \"Gender and Sexuality in American History\" examines how gender (the ways in which various societies define what it means to be a \"man\" or a \"woman\") and changing attitudes toward sexual behaviors influenced selected issues and events in American history. We will consider the European \"discovery\" of America, the industrial revolution, race relations in the \"Old\" and \"New\" South, the Spanish American War, and the Cold War. We'll examine the relevance of issues that we often think of as \"private\" to political and economic history. We'll focus on sources such as visual images, songs, novels, and films in order to understand how Americans themselves viewed the relationship between gender and sexuality, on one hand, and political, social and economic events, on the other. B 204 Medieval Heroes (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Shopkow This course is an introduction to the history of the Middle Ages in western Europe through its heroes. What made people heroes in the Middle Ages? Who can be a hero? Who can become a heroine? How did changes in medieval society create changes in people's thinking about heroes? And how do modern people see these medieval heroes? We will look at a mix of figures to represent the three periods of the Middle Ages: the early Middle Ages (c. 300-c. 1000), the high Middle Ages (c. 1000-c. 1300), and the later Middle Ages (c. 1300-c. 1500).

(Fall) (S&H) Dierks This course provides a topical introduction to American history, from the era of Columbus's exploration of the \"New World\" through the era of the American Civil War. As our guiding themes we will focus on cultural tensions between freedom and unfreedom, between equality and inequality, and between prosperity and poverty. Has it ever, for example, been possible in American history to imagine \"equality\" without at the same time excluding some people? In examining such cultural tensions, we will look in particular at how notions of gender, class, and race have changed over time, first in a \"colonial\" context when European peoples sought to transfer ideals and practices to the challenging new environment of North America, and then in a \"postcolonial\" context when competing social groups struggled for position in the young American nation. Throughout the course, we will situate North America and then the United States not only in a multicultural but also in a global context. Reading assignments feature \"primary source\" documents written by people in the past; writing assignments entail three short papers and a take- home final exam. H 105 American History I (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Grossberg This course examines the history of what would become the United States from initial European colonization to the Civil War. It is designed to introduce students to the study of American history. The course will be divided into three eras: colonial, revolutionary, and antebellum. In each era, students will examine the interrelationship of social, political, economic, and cultural change. They will explore such persistent issues in American history as individualism, republicanism, and capitalism, and the human motivations, external forces, and generational influences that affected their development. Students will also examine the craft of history as a way of understanding human experience by reading various kinds of historical texts such as a biography, fiction documents, and articles on history as a form of detective work. H 105 American History I (3 cr.) (Spring) (S&H) Myers, Stowe H 106 American History II (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Bodnar This is a course that surveys the major themes and events that marked the history of the United States since the Civil War.

Most readings will be available on library E-Reserve. There will be several quizzes and exams in essay format upon which to base a grade. H 106 American History II (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Sandweiss In 1863 Abraham Lincoln asked the mourners at the \"hallowed ground\" of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, to carry on the nation's \"unfinished work.\" Lincoln was talking about more than the incomplete Civil War; he was describing a larger experiment, begun nearly a century earlier, to establish liberty in a new nation. This is a course about that experiment. How have Americans responded to Lincoln's charge? Will their work ever be finished? What can we learn about their efforts from looking at the landscape of farms, towns, cities, and suburbs that surrounds us? To answer these questions, we examine key moments in Americans' ongoing struggle for life, liberty, and happiness\u2014a struggle that recommenced in 1865 and continues, in our own lives, today. In this course you will master the outline of modern U.S. history, learning from textbook, primary documents, literature, sound, and images. You will develop your research and writing skills, and you will document the history of some unsung heroes: your own family. H 106 American History II (3 cr.) (Spring) (S&H) McGerr H 207 Modern East Asian Civilization (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Frick This course will introduce students to important cultural and social themes relevant for understanding the history and present of modern and contemporary East Asia. The course is focused on China, Japan, and Korea. One of the central questions is how these countries have coped with Western imperialism, the quest for modernity, and the increasing trend of \"internationalization.\" What is the response and how do they define themselves in a global setting? How do they perceive their own identity? The course is based on the assumption that the diverse interactions among the East Asian countries in the past and in modern times resulted in social and cultural commonalities as well as differences among China, Japan, and Korea. Similarities and discrepancies shall be examined and analyzed in class through key topics such as family and social structure, women, education, as well as culture. These main topics will be embedded into historical narratives of important events that occurred from the nineteenth century until recently. The lectures will integrate different materials such as paintings, political cartoons, literature, and films, as well as documents. H 211 Latin American Culture and Civilization I (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Diaz This course is part one of a two-course sequence on the history of Latin America from pre-conquest times to the present. It will survey the history of Latin America from its first inhabitation to the independence period in the nineteenth century. Major themes to be addressed include: the development of the great Amerindian civilizations, the encounter between Europeans and Amerindians, the making of a colonial rule, and the civil wars of independence. The overriding concern of this survey is to provide an understanding of how the complex interaction between the different cultures that met in the Americas shaped these colonial societies, and how some elements of this legacy persisted and/or were transformed by different social groups before and after independence. This course should help students gain some understanding of the diversity and complexity of Latin America. Students will obtain a sense of both the major processes that have left their imprint in these countries, and the experiences of the men and women who lived and made their histories. Furthermore, this course seeks to bring students a sense of history as a discipline and as a method for interpreting and understanding the past through the study of myriad sources. Students should be able to assess the importance of closely analyzing different perspectives and sources when seeking to understand and interpret any event or problem of the past. H212 Latin American Culture and Civilization II (3 cr.) (Spring) (S&H) McGraw H 213 The Black Death (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Carmichael H 220 American Military History (3 cr.)

H 252 Jewish History: Spanish Expulsion to Present (3 cr.) (Spring) (S&H) Lehman History and Philosophy of Science (HPSC) X 100 Human Perspectives on Science (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (A&H) Topics: (Fall) Remaking the World: Historical and Philosophical Reflection on Sustainability and Change; or Is Science True? (Spring) The Scientist and the Cinema; or Is Science True? This course is an introduction to the study of science as a human activity. No specific background knowledge of science is presupposed. Issues such as the 56 University Division Guide 2010-2011 following are addressed: What is distinctive about scientific reasoning? How did science develop? How do science and technology affect our lives? Each section of X 100 deals with a different topic, and topics may vary each semester. X 100 may be repeated once with a different topic. X 102 Revolutions in Science: Plato to NATO (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (S&H) At critical junctures in the past, the ideas and productions of scientists have radically changed the way we've come to view nature, our bodies, and our lives. These changes have been intellectually profound and socially dramatic. Historians often refer to them as scientific revolutions. This course is about such revolutions in Western science. We will consider several so-called \"revolutionary\" episodes, examining how (or if) the idea of a \"revolution\" can be applied to each. To get a better sense of the nature, origins, and impact of these \"revolutionary\" ideas, we will also examine the history of what occurred during these periods of great scientific and social change. For example, we'll look at the impor- tance of economic changes, political movements, and the role of women in the history of science. X 123 Perspectives on Science: Social and Historical (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (S&H) Topic: (Fall) Contemporary Issues in Bioethic s Individual sections will vary in content and major themes, but all will employ case studies from the history of science to examine the intellectual, cultural, and social impact of science in historical perspective. May be repeated once for credit with different topic. X 200 Scientific Reasoning (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (N&M) People have used scientific arguments to support a variety of claims. Some of these claims seem like common sense to us now, such as the claims that the earth goes around the sun or that germs cause disease. Others still cause heated disputes, such as those about the human origins of global warming, the relative danger of toxic waste incineration, or the dietary benefits of oat bran. The objective of this course is to develop the skills necessary to understand and evaluate scientific reasoning. These skills include identifying the goals of scientific reasoning and recognizing how science manages to succeed or fail at reaching those goals. We will examine both the general features of a good argument and the specific techniques of argumentation used in science. We will pay attention to particular issues such as the use and misuse of statistics and experiments. Examples of scientific reasoning will be drawn from historical sources, current public controversies, and the work of actual scientists. No knowledge of science or mathematics beyond the high school level is assumed. X 223 Issues in Science: Social and Historical (3cr.) (Fall, Spring) (S&H) Topic: (Fall) Environmental History. (Spring) Science and the Public General topics and themes, intellectual, cultural, and social impact of science in historical perspective. May be repeated once for credit with different topic.Honors Seminars (HON) The Hutton Honors College (HHC) sponsors approximately 100 departmental courses for freshmen and sophomores, courses ranging over a wide variety of disciplines and interdisciplinary studies.

We will examine the rapid spread of Islam to the east and west during the ninth-eleventh centuries; the Crusades; the three so-called gunpowder states of Anatolia (the Ottomans), Persia (the Safavids), and the Indian Subcontinent (the Mughals); Colonialism and Orientalism; and the emergence of modern Islamic art. N 305 Issues in Middle Eastern Literature (3cr.) (Fall) Stetkevych Topic: Poetry and Empire: The Arabic Ode Throughout the 1500 years of recorded Arabic poetry, the ode has been used to confer, deny, negotiate, and compete for legitimate rule. Poetry and Empire will begin by examining the roots of the Arab- Islamic tradition in the royal and tribal odes of pre-Islamic Arabia as bearers of ancient Near Eastern concepts of mythic, divinely appointed kingship and legitimate rule. We will then look at the Islamization of the ancient ode to confer legitimacy upon and declare allegiance to the Prophet Muhammad and the nascent Islamic state. We will examine the courtly ode in the early Islamic, Umayyad, and Abbasid periods, and the Fatimids in Egypt and the Umayyads and their successor states in al-Andalus. Finally, we will turn to the period of European imperialism in the Arab world (19th-20th centuries), when poetry was used as a counter- and anti-imperial tool to convey the humanistic ideals of the Arab Nahah (Renaissance) and to call for freedom from foreign occupation and domination. N 306 Topics in Middle Eastern Studies (3 cr.)

(Fall) Trix Topic: Islam in the Balkans Islam came to the Balkans in the fourteenth and the fifteenth centuries with the Ottomans and spread across the peninsula of southeastern Europe. In this class we study the history of Islam in the Balkans, from the gradual conversions of local people, the political and cultural heights of the Ottoman Empire, to the decline of the Ottoman Empire, the growth of ethnic-based nation states, and the relegation of most Muslim communities to minority status. We will study the Ottoman cities of Edirne, Salonika, and Sarajevo, and the place of Balkan Muslims in the Ottoman Empire. We will also study the forced migrations and expulsions of Muslims from the Balkans in the ninteenth and tweentieth centuries, culminating in the wars in Bosnia and Kosovo in the 1990s.

N 307 Issues in Islamic Studies (3 cr.) (Fall) Afsaruddin Topic: War and Peace in Islamic Tradition War and peace are universal themes that Muslim scholars took great interest in. This class will focus on how war and peace were dealt with as religious, ethical, legal, and social issues within the diverse Islamic tradition. The term jihad and its derivatives as well as the concept of martyrdom have a great bearing on the understandings of war and peace in Islam. Accordingly, class readings and discussion will focus on how jihad and related concepts are treated in the Qur'an, hadith and hortatory literature, legal and mystical texts, from both the premodern and modern periods. Juridical conceptualizations of jihad as legitimate warfare will be compared to Western Christian constructions of just war and the commonalities between these two concepts will be explored. N 307 Issues in Islamic Studies (3 cr.) (Fall) Afsaruddin Topic: Islamic Feminisms This course will provide a broad survey of the historical positions of women in premodern and modern Muslim societies, defined by the normative values of Islam and by cultural traditions that are sometimes at odds with religious prescriptions. We will discuss how the interpretations of these normative values in diverse circumstances and who gets to do the interpreting have had an important impact on women's societal roles. As increasingly more women scholars are appropriating the process of textual interpretation, it is giving rise to a heightened feminist consciousness and authority in a number of Muslim-majority societies\u2014a phenomenon that many are calling Islamic feminism(s), which will be the focus of this class. The second half of the course will privilege women's voices in articulating their gendered identities and roles in mainly the Middle East, as expressed in memoirs, fiction, magazine articles, and public speeches.

Credit is not given for both P 150 and P 250 if P 150 is taken concurrently with P 250 or if P 150 is taken after P 250. In order to earn credit for both, P 150 must be taken before P 250. P 201 Ancient Greek Philosophy (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) All of Western philosophy owes an incalculable debt to Plato and Aristotle. Their writings continue to provoke and stimulate students to this day. The modern student learns from them what it means to think philosophically. What better place to begin the philosophical enterprise than with ancient Greek philosophers? The Ionian cosmologists, the Eleatics, the Sophists, Socrates, Plato and Aristotle are the very sources of Western philosophy and, indeed, much of Western culture and thought. P 211 Early Modern Philosophy (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Abramson P 250 Introductory Symbolic Logic (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (N&M) This is an introductory course in modern formal logic. The course teaches how to translate informal arguments from English into symbolic logic and then how to use formal tools to assess their validity. Students will be taught how to construct proofs for valid arguments and counter-examples to invalid arguments. Symbolic logic is not only useful for improving reasoning skills, but it is a formal tool used in many disciplines outside of philosophy. P 150, which is a more elementary treatment of similar topics, is not a prerequisite for this course. Credit is not given for both P 150 and P 250 if P 150 is taken concurrently with P 250 or if P 150 is taken after P 250. In order to earn credit for both, P 150 must be taken before P 250.

(Fall) (A&H) The Hebrew Bible\u2014the Old Testament to Christians, the Tanakh to Jews\u2014is perhaps the most read text in the history of the world. It is also the most misread. This course takes a historical approach to the various books that came to be seen by many as sacred scripture. What do we know about who wrote the Bible, the world that produced it, and the events it describes? Why was it written, and what was it trying to communicate? We will not read the entirety of the Hebrew Bible in this course, but we will instead concentrate on selected texts in order to appreciate the span of topics in the Hebrew Bible, from the creation myth to the exploits of ancient kings to poems celebrating love and wisdom. A 220 Introduction to the New Testament (3 cr.) (Spring) (A&H) Harrill A 230 Introduction to Judaism (3 cr.)

In pursuit of these aims, we will investigate a wide range of primary sources in translation, together with additional texts (and a few films) that will help you to contextualize and understand this material. No previous knowledge of Buddhism is required. This course is also approved for College of Arts and Sciences Topics credit. B 220 Introduction to Hinduism (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Haberman Approximately one-fifth of people on our diverse planet identify themselves as Hindus. This course is a historical survey of the major movements within the Hindu religious tradition. While tracing the history, we will explore the creative tension between the ascetic's quest for freedom and the householder's search for enjoyment. This provides an opportunity to examine religious issues such as differing views of the self, the nature of the world, and the ultimate goal of life. We will examine the classical texts of the Hindu traditions, such as the Upanishads, Bhagavad-Gita , and Gitagovinda , and also view films and slides to gain access to the rich visual dimension of contemporary Hindu culture. D 250 Religion, Ecology, and the Self (3 cr.) (Spring) (A&H) Haberman R 102 Religion and Popular Culture (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) (Second eight weeks) Who was or is Jesus of Nazareth? The divine Word of the Gospel of John? The strong and mighty Lord of medieval liturgical poetry? The symbol for all persecuted minorities of the controversial movie The Color of the Cross ? The conflicted messiah of The Last Temptation of Christ ? Or the funny, down to earth savior that often has adventures with Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny in S outh Park? Instead of deciding who is the \"real\" Jesus of Nazareth, in this course we will focus on how different depictions of Jesus reflect the values, hopes, fears, and anxieties of the cultures that produced them. In order to do so, we will focus on a variety of sources from different time periods (biblical narratives, medieval and contemporary literature, art, TV shows, and cinema). We will compare and contrast and think critically of these sources in order to reflect about the meaning and relevance of the many meanings that Jesus of Nazareth has had over time. Key topics in this course will be religious tradition and its reassertions, challenges and skepticism of tradition, the role of religious figures as countercultural icons, and the overall role of religious figures in pop culture. Students will be evaluated in two short reflection papers and a final exam (two essay questions). R 133 Introduction to Religion (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (A&H) Levene, Furey What is religion? A communal system of beliefs and practices? An individual search for meaning and truth? This course is an introduction to religion through a consideration of these questions in a global context. We will focus on the creation and formation of a religious self, exploring the values and responsibilities such a self presumes. Drawing on scriptures and philosophies in a wide variety of contexts and styles, we will gather a repertoire of ideas of religion, along with the methods, perspectives, and questions that will enable us to launch fruitful comparisons. R 152 Jews, Christians, Muslims (3 cr.) (Spring) (A&H) R 153 Religions of Asia (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (A&H) Blair This course introduces students to the study of several Asian religions, namely Buddhism, Hinduism, Confucianism, Daoism, and Shinto, and focuses on the question of what the classics are and why they are classic. Over the course of the semester, we will explore the changing interpretations of important, canonical texts such as the Dao de jing and Bhagavad gita. And in the process, we will analyze how context affects the meaning, status, and uses of a religious text. This course includes in-depth readings from primary sources (though we will also use a textbook for background information), and asks students to read critically and actively. In addition to readings assigned for each class meeting, requirements include a midterm, final, and short weekly writing exercises. The course format includes both lectures and discussions, and there are no prerequisites. R 160 Religion and American Culture (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (A&H) Brown How does religion influence American culture, and how does American culture shape religion? We will answer this question by reading and discussing novels, correspondence, laws, autobiographies, and ethnographies; by viewing movies, television, art, and cartoons; by listening to music; and even by eating food! The goal of this course is to provide an engaging, accessible introduction to how religion and American culture have intertwined, both historically and in the present, while developing skills in critical thinking, written and oral communication, and analysis of documents that will help students to prepare for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses and for careers in a variety of professions, including business, law, medicine, and education. We will focus on Protestantism, Catholicism, Judaism, and Islam, but other traditions will also be mentioned. R 170 Religion, Ethics, and Public Life (3 cr.)

S 101 Social Problems and Policies (3 cr.)(Fall) (S&H) Irby Topic: Growing Up and Growing Old: An Introduction to the Life Course Designed to provide students with an overview of the major concepts related to the life course, the focus will be on examining life from birth to death, with the aging process as a main focus. We will talk about age as not just a biological process but as a social phenomenon. You will learn how your individual life is structured by the historical period in which you live, the birth cohort in which you are part, and the culture in which you are embedded. You will also learn how family, community, work, and education are all interdependent. You will discover how life trajectories are influenced by one's gender, race, and social class. The overarching theme for this course is a focus on social problems. Thus, we will examine how life events and experiences 70 University Division Guide 2010-2011 over the life course such as birth, childhood, adolescence, marriage, starting a career, and dying are accompanied by struggles, obstacles, and barriers. S 101 Social Problems and Policies (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (S&H) Pescosolido Topic: Medicine in America: Physicians, Patients, and Their Problems. The United States has the costliest health care system in the world, yet it is criticized for its failure to cure society's ills such as cancer, heart disease, and AIDS. When people do get sick, many do not have the financial means to pay for needed services, or they may receive inferior care because of their inability to pay for more effective but costly treatment. All of these issues deal with health and medical care that all of us experience in one form or another. This course explores basic questions about a wide range of topics dealing with the providers of care, the recipients of care, and the larger context of health, illness, and disease. S 101 Social Problems and Policies (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Shaddox Topic: Religion and Politics How have U.S. church-state relations changed in recent decades? What models for church-state relations do other Western nations practice? Should government funds be used to support church and faith-based social service programs for the poor? Can businesses restrict the religious practices of their employees? Do Religious believers have the right to proselytize others in public places? Is religion good or bad for democracy? Answers to such questions depend on how we understand the relationship between religion and politics. This course builds toward a broad understanding of the major issues and complexities that arise when religion and politics intersect. We will use a social scientific approach to religion in order to examine many of the underlying sociological, political, historical, legal, and cultural issues regarding how it operates in the American political landscape. Although our primary focus will be the evolution of this tension in the United States, a portion of the course will look at how other nations have addressed these issues. S 110 Charts, Graphs, and Tables (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (N&M) Social scientists attempt to better understand the social world. Almost always, numbers are used to illustrate and convey relationships interesting to researchers. These numbers must be presented in an accessible and interpretable fashion. Charts, graphs, and tables are effective ways to present empirical results. At each stage in the research process, errors can be made, accidentally or purposefully, that ultimately may lead to inappropriate and/or misleading results and conclusions. This course will prepare you to be a knowledgeable and critical consumer of research findings. Perhaps more important, you will also become a good producer of scientific knowledge. This is not a math course. Rather, it is a class that focuses on quantitative reasoning. Throughout the semester we will focus less on the mathematics behind producing numbers and more on the underlying logic of the mathematical procedures. Accordingly, you will learn some elementary statistical techniques, how and when to use them, and various techniques available for presenting your results. Finally, you will apply what you have learned and be able to make correct conclusions about aspects of our social world. S 210 The Economy, Organizations, and Work (3 cr.)
