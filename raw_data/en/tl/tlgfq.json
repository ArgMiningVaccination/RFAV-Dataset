Coral completed her Doctorate degree at Frontier University in Hyden, KY. She is Board Certified by the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners and is fully trained and credentialed having over 10 years of clinical experience. She brings with her expertise in a broad spectrum of both traditional and holistic theory and practice. Her personal journey of healing from an autoimmune disorder, fatigue, pain, neurological, and microbiome dysfunction gives her particular insight into unraveling the complex challenges that women face when symptoms are overwhelming and healing feels elusive. The goal is to empower you, the patient, with meaningful information, cutting edge research, alternative perspectives, and a range of holistic options that offer you the tools that you need to heal and feel well in your body, while avoiding the potential side effects and risks of synthetic hormones, pharmaceutical medications, and surgery. Functional Medicine/Women's Health: fed up with a healthcare system that addresses only symptoms and relies heavily on prescription medication? Doctors and patients are now turning to a new, personalized model known as Functional Medicine. Some people call it the \"medicine of the future\" because it addresses the healthcare needs of the 21st century by shifting the traditional disease-centered focus of medical practice to a more patient-centered approach. What does this mean for the patient? At a Functional Medicine practice, a doctor will not simply prescribe medication to deal with the immediate symptoms but look into the root of the problem. Patients can expect to spend more time talking to their doctors about their medical and family histories and are empowered to take an active role in their health. With the rise of chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer and heart disease, Functional Medicine moves away from the traditional acute-care approach by incorporating the latest in genetic science, specialized testing not available at your traditional doctor's office, and most importantly, understanding how environmental and lifestyle factors influence the emergence and progression of disease. The idea is to move away from putting a temporary patch on the problem, but instead focus on treating the entire human organism to spread health and vitality. The treatments are all natural, using vitamins, minerals and specialized supplements that won't cause the side effects seen in synthetic prescription medications. In a nutshell, the goal is for patients to look and feel ten years younger while practicing prevention to avoid future disease. As the practice of Functional Medicine continues to grow so do the anti aging treatments, including the controversial hormone replacement therapy. This service has become popular and is provided in many offices, but it is critical that patients do their research and ensure they are working with a certified professional. MENOPAUSE | FEMALE HORMONES | HOT FLASHES | ESTROGEN \u00b7 Have you noticed weight gain? \u00b7 Are you struggling with insomnia? \u00b7 Are you experiencing low sex drive? \u00b7 Are you experiencing mood swings? \u00b7 Are hot flashes disrupting your day? \u00b7 The balance of hormones is vital to a woman's health but in Menopause, when levels are dropping, a deficiency of one hormone can trigger excess of another and various imbalances. These imbalances cause the effects we so commonly see, such as: mood swings, hot flashes, insomnia, migraines, risk for disease, acne and hair loss. We look at a variety of hormone levels including Estrone, estradiol, cortisol to find the imbalance. By utilizing a functional and preventative approach to look at the cause through testing, holistic and natural treatments as well as bio-identical hormone therapy. We also incorporate various preventative treatments such as stress reduction, exercise, natural therapies and various organic foods. The end goal is optimal hormone balance based on each individual's needs by listening to how you feel and also optimal lab values. "}
