It is the ability to listen to and know what your body is communicating to you. It's like learning a new energetic language. Learning how to listen to and communicate with your body can create more peace, space and joy for you and your body. What if it was possible to have more ease and fun with your body and your life? Your body speaks in soft energetic whispers. When your body can't get your attention, it turns up the volume. When you continue to ignore your body, it eventually starts screaming. We often interpret that screaming as pain or other discomfort. What is your body telling you? Body Whispering is a deeper dive into what else is possible for you and your body. [LEARN MORE](/pages/body-whispering) Limitless Living Limitless Living is about accessing the infinite possibilities that are available to you.

Did you know that peace is a natural state for animals? This is true for people too, but our minds often get in the way of us being still, peaceful, and totally present. When you create or tap into a place of peace for a horse or animal, everything becomes calm, cool and collected - you're in the zone. Do you know that every animal, plant and structure, every molecule on this planet has consciousness and desires to gift to you? If you are unwilling to receive, then you miss out on what they wish to give you. You also limit your ability to receive in every area of your life - the money you can have, what you can experience, and what is possible for you.

Julie's approach is radically different and is geared toward results. Julie can facilitate equines in many different areas - health issues, behavioral challenges, trauma or abuse, loss of spirit, off their feed, not acting like themselves, or maybe you simply desire a greater connection with your horse. Regardless of the issue, Julie offers alternative solutions that work! Equines are amazing creatures. Equines are like your body; they are conscious. They know what they desire, they know what they require, and they know what will actually work for them. However, horses and other animals, will pick up on whatever we project at them. This can create unease in their universe, dis-ease in their body, and what we would call behavioral problems or other issues.

I have attended two of the body processes classes she has facilitated. Both classes were more than I expected! She communicates well so that everything runs smoothly. Thank you Julie for sharing all your knowledge and being an inspiration.\" Anne | | \"Thank you Julie for opening my world up.\" | | \"What am I supposed to be doing? What is my purpose? Those were the questions I had prior to being exposed to Access Consciousness. I have been a mental health therapist for over 10 years and wanted to do more. I felt like there were still other ways to help people and that I was limited in how much I could help. It was not until I took an Access Consciousness Introduction with Julie, that I realized how limited I was and how I was limiting my life. After an hour session, my life changed tremendously. It was as if I was able to see infinite possibilities in my life and that they were attainable. Because of this introduction I have chosen to also become a holistic practitioner and am now sharing the tools with family and friends to help them clear their limitations. I have noticed a significant change in my relationships and my bank account, because I truly, choose to live a life of ease, joy and glory and live in question. How does it get any better than that and what else is possible? Thank you Julie for opening my world up.\" Shimeka Access Possibilities Blog [ ](/blogs/news/body-whispering-101-body-awareness-oct-27-2023) [Body Whispering 101 Body Awareness | Oct 27 2023](/blogs/news/body-whispering-101-body-awareness-oct-27-2023) [ ](/blogs/news/introduction-to-body-whispering-sep-21-2023) [Introduction To Body Whispering | Sep 21](/blogs/news/introduction-to-body-whispering-sep-21-2023) [ ](/blogs/news/introduction-to-body-whispering-sep-19-2023) [Introduction To Body Whispering | Sep 19](/blogs/news/introduction-to-body-whispering-sep-19-2023) Subscribe to Access Possibilities!Receive updates, promotions, new product and service announcements, event notifications, tips, tools and more.
