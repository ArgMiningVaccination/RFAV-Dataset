Thinking about safety for animals that ha ve trouble crossing our roads. And kids take st eps towar ds remembering those that sacrificed everything during our past wars . Hi w elcome to another week on BtN. I'm Nathan Bazl ey. Also today we'll head north to find out why some of our favourite fruit is so fussy and even gets a bit gr umpy. UV Warning Repo rter: Natasha Thiele INTRO: A new re port from scientists reckons that people don't apply enough sunscreen to get the sun protection they need. Sunscreen's job is to reduce the amount of UV rays getting into our skin. Now we all know that to o much UV can cause problems. But what exactly is UV light a nd what does it do to us? Tash went to find out. NATASHA THIELE, REPORTER: Introducing UV man! His name stands for ultraviolet! He's got killer rays that travel from the sun to the earth's surface and into your skin. In real life they're invisible. But UV can be more d eadly than this silly character. Enough about UV man for now, what is UV? Well, there's a whole spectrum of energy the sun gives off, some that we can see and some that we can't. The s tuff we can see is this bit 'visible light'. That's how we can see colours. And UV is right next to it! UV light can be used in lots of things like tanning beds, barcode scanners, agriculture and even in forensics. But UV can cause problems for us, like sunburn and skin cancer. This is what a common type of skin cancer called 'melanoma' looks like. Exposure to UV rays can damage skin cells and cause them to grow abnormally into a cancerous lump. The cells can then invade the body through the blood st ream. To help warn people about harmful ultraviolet rays, scientists have found a way to measure how much UV is expected to reach us. And each day we can check out the weather bureau online or watch the news on TV to see the warnings. REPORTER: Well thi s is what they look like. This UV warning says it'll be very high to extreme b ut when it's that high on a summer day in Australia, you can get burnt in less than 15 minutes. Even schools are checking UV alerts every morning in their classroom. It remind s them that they need to be SunSmart when they're outdoors. UV alerts are calculated by looking at things like the time of year and how many clouds are around. But even if it's cloudy, UV rays can still be damaging. BOY 1: My mum always tells me to put sunscreen on and a hat, even if it's not sunny, so just to make sure that I'm not sunburnt. GIRL: I know that if I don't wear sunscreen or protect my skin, I could end up with something like skin cancer and I actually know someone with skin cancer and I know how serious it is, so I make sure I protect myself. BOY 2: Keep in the shade, wear a hat, use a rashie when you're swimming and put a lot of sunscreen on. But there's a bright side to UV exposure and it's called Vitamin D. The sun is the only plac e you can get it. It's important for our bodies because it helps the calcium we need for healthy bones, teeth and muscles. UV man and his deadly affects will always be there! So it's a good idea to keep an eye on the UV warnings to protect yourself and o thers. The Wire And the researchers say you should put on sunscreen twice about 20 minutes apart before you go outside. OK, there were some big music awards handed out over the weekend so Alfie checked it out. *********** It was a family affair at the 2010 A RIA awards last night, with a brother and siste r duo, Angus and Julia Stone t he big winners. The S ydney sibl ings won both the best single and best album of the year. Megan Washington won best breakthrough perfor mer, and best female artist while D an Sultan won best male. And Powderfinger, in their last live TV performance, took home two trophies. The aw ards, held at the Sydney Opera H ouse, celebrate the best in Australian music. Siphoning Sport Reporter: Nathan Bazley INTRO: There is a fight on in sport but this one isn't on the field or on the sidelines. It's in the boardrooms of the big TV channels of Australia. The fight is on b etween free-to air and pay TV about who deserves the rights to broadcast different sports. And just like fight s out on the field this one has the potential to get ugly . NATHAN BAZLEY, REPORTER: This is the most watched Australian TV event of the last decade. (2005 Australian Open Men's Final: Lleyton Hewitt v Marat Safin) This is the second. (2003 Rugby World Cu p Final: Australia v England) This is third and fourth (Masterchef 2010 & 2009) This is fifth (2006 Commonwealth Games: Opening Ceremony) And this is sixth (2005 AFL Grand Final: Sydney Swans v West Coast Eagles) What does all this tell you? Austra lian's love watching sport (and Masterchef) on TV. But mostly sport! NATHAN: However right now, there is a big fight over sport on TV or more importantly, where it is on TV. And it's a fight that could change your viewing habits quite a bit. You would have noticed that some sports are played on free -to-air TV stations, like Channels 7, 9 & 10; and some are played on pay TV stations, like Foxtel. These stations bid on the rights to broadcast them, and that can cost up to $150 million per season. But no t any station can bid on any sport. The government has a list of 12 main sports that free -to-air TV channels are allowed to have first dibs on before pay TV is allowed to buy them. It's called an ' anti-siphoning list'. Here's what's on it. First there is the Olympic and Commonwealth games. Then there is the race that stops the nation - the Melbourne Cup. There are local motorsports like the V8 supercars. Aussie cricket played here or in the UK. And the major local and international golf tournaments. There's every netball game featuring the Diamonds. And the major tennis comps from around the world. The Soccer World Cup makes the grade. As does the Union World Cup and the Wallabies tests. And finally, there is the entire season of NRL, and every game of the AFL to round the whole thing out. The list has been around for a while, but at the end of this year it's all up for grabs and changes might be made. And that's got people fired up. Free -to-air stations are worried that sports will be taken o ff the list, allowing pay TV to buy them and only let sub scribers watch. They say that all Australians should witness the great sporting triumphs, rather than just those that can afford pay TV. But on the other hand, pay TV is worried more sports will be added to the list, meaning they would struggle to keep some viewers. They say they're in a much better position to show the sports because they can put more money into broadcasts. Over in the UK, Premier League Soccer switched to pay TV, and that chang e is partly credited with helping grow the code into the world's most watched sport league. Pay TV brought them more camera angles, better graphics, and more live matches. Whereas in Australia, many free -to-air matches like Friday night AFL, are still sh own on delay. But making things more tricky is the fact that now free -to-air has a whole lot more digital channels to play with. And instead of breaking into their main channels, they'd love to play sports on their extra digital ones too. But pay TV say s that's unfair, because not everyone has digital yet. It's a pretty bitter fight and just like a lot of classic sporting matches, this one will have sport fans from either side on the edge of their seats. Presenter: Now we'd like to know w hat you guys think about that so let's make that our poll this week. Online Poll The question is: Should big sports be shown on free TV or pay TV? To vote just head to our website . And le t's look at what you thought in last week's poll. We asked if you prefer to rent movies from a DVD shop or an online service. And we got a pretty one -sided result. 81% voted for the DVD shop and 19 % said you prefer going online. Koala Roads Reporter: Natasha Thiele INTRO: We often hear of koalas being accidentally killed or injured on Australian roads. They're s ometimes forced to cross them because the areas they live in are being des troyed for human development or they're trying to escape predators. Unfortunat ely koalas and cars don't mix but scientists are looking at way to help protect the koalas. Tash had a look at what they're working on . NATASHA THIELE, REPORTER: We live in one busy world! But for these furry little guys, keeping up with our pace can be difficult . Koalas are the one of the most re cognisable animal s in Australia but these koalas in south east Queensland a re being pushed out of their own neighbourhoods. REPORTER: Their habitat is being taken over by new homes, so they're being forced to try and cross busy roads for food or to reproduce. Sadly, eve ry year about 100 of them are killed or injured on the roads in this area. But university researchers are trying to create roads that may be safer for the animals. DARRYL JONES, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR (GRIFFITH UNIVERSITY): If you're a slow moving animal l ike a koala the risk is huge. We are really determined if we possibly can to let the koalas still exist in this environment so we have to do something! To do that, there a few steps they need to take! Let's start with the first one. The researchers need to catch some of the local koalas, which can be tough work. They're focusing on the koalas that live on the so called `Koala Coast ', which is just south of Brisbane. New homes are going up around the area, where the koala's natural habitat is, and that' s what can cause the animals to move away. But often in doing that, they get killed. That's where more research comes in . The researchers then look at which roads are causing the most koala deaths. At the moment, roads are making it really hard for koa las to move from one spot to another. The idea is to eventually make roads in the area more koala -friendly, like putting up fencing, underpasses and even a koala bridge! But the problem is , how does a koala know they're there and even how to use them ? That's when step three comes in. To work out if the koalas will be okay using the new koala -friendly features; scientists need to study what the animals get up to when they're not crossing roads. And they plan to track 60 of them. They'll get a vet chec k and have a GPS collar put on, like the latest recruit Jolez! The tracking device will help researchers keep a watchful eye on what she does. Creating safer areas f or animals has been done before. Four years ago, researchers in far north Queensland cam e up with an idea to get these rare rainforest ringtail possums to cross the road and get to the other side. And it was this, a man -made 'marsupial highway'. It's like a really big ladder strung between tall trees and the possums use it at night time. The idea's caught on and they're now being used in other places. The Koala researchers reckon this is just the start of a really important experiment and if it works the ideas can be used all around Australia. Housing and development is growing i n this a rea but with more koala friendly roads a possibility in the future, it could just help protect some of our furry friends! Quiz 1 OK, time to test you out with a tricky quiz . Remembrance D ay is coming up and you'll probably hear that tune called the Las t Post. So here's the question. The Last Post is usually played on which musical instrument? Bugle Trombone Flute Answer: Bugle Presenter: Listen carefully to our next story and you will hear some of it. Remembrance Day Reporter: Kirsty Bennett INTRO: The First World W ar ended almost a century ago but a group of primary school kids are reliving some of the soldier's tales. A memor ial walk was built last year to honour past st udents who died in the Vietnam War and in World Wars One and Two. With Remembrance Day this Thursday, Kirsty took a visit to the school to chat with the kids about what the day means to them. KIRSTY BENNETT, REPORTER: After four years of war, on the 11th of November 1918 the guns fell silent. It was the end of World War One wh ere more than 60, 000 people died and around 150,000 were wounded. A year later an Australian journo suggested that this date should be a day to remember those who sacrificed their lives. It was first called Armistice Day but now it 's known as Remembrance Day. So every year at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month, Australia holds a minute's silence. It's a similar ritual in other count ries, even in places where fighting is going on today. This special time to remember started almost a century ago, but the day still means a lot. VOX POP: You remember all your friends you see who didn't come back. KIRSTY: There are many different ways people like to pay their respect. This is one flower you may see people wearing, it's called a poppy . It's sometimes called the \"flower of remembrance\" because it grew in the battlefields where many soldiers had died. You might also see people wearing a sprig of rosemary. Since ancient times people believed the herb made memories stronger so it's worn as a symbol of remembrance. This is a sound you might hear at ceremonies. The Last Post is a military tradition. It's to signal soldiers back to their barracks. Now it's played more as a farewell to those who died. At Mitcham Primary School in South Austr alia, students have their own way to pay their respects. These plaques represent the soldiers who once went to Mitcham Primary and died in war. KIANA, STUDENT: It's very touching I guess that we went to the same school and we learnt the same things. KIRSTY: For their school assignments, they had to pick a soldier and retrace their footsteps. Along the way, Hero found out that the soldier she was researching may have crossed paths with her family. KIRSTY, REPORTER: Have you developed any connection with him now? HERO, STUDENT: Yeah I really feel like I have and the place that he died my great grandfather was a grave digger there so he died in Village Bretonneux. KIRSTY: The students reckon their new connection with the soldiers will make this Remembran ce Day stand out. HENRY, STUDENT: It's made me think of things a little bit differently I mean we take so much for granted nowadays that they didn't have. KIANA, STUDENT: Well I guess I'll sit down and think about my soldier a little bit and the tough t ime that he went through just for our country to make it what it is now - that's very important. KIRSTY: Even after Remembrance Day, the students will always have this reminder. STASI, STUDENT: Well yeah when we walk home from school most kids come dow n here so it 's really nice and it looks great too. KIRSTY: So it sounds like this path and its stories won't be forgotten. Presenter: And there's more info about that and the other stories on today's show on our website. OK, let's catch up with what's b een happening in sport. The Score Surfing king Kelly Slater has t aken out his 10th world title confirming his name as one of the world's best athletes. Slater put toge ther a string of perfect tens to beat Brazilian Adr iano De Souza in the quarters then Aussies Taj Burrow and Bede Du rbidge in the semis and final. The win makes Slater both the youngest and old est man to win a world title which he d edicated to rival Andy Irons who died last week. Kelly Slater: \"Condolence out to family, I wouldn't be whe re I am today. \" Slater now says he wouldn't mind trying to win a pro golf tournament. ******* To Fo rmula 1 now and Aussie Mark Webber is still in the hunt for his first drivers world championship after a second place at the Brazilian Grand Prix. Teamma te and fierce rival Sebast ian Vettel took out the race with championship leader Fernando Alonso rounding out the podium. The one - two for the R ed-bull team saw them secure the constructors championship , which is a reward that goes to the most successful team overall. But the drivers' race remains wide open coming into the last round at Abu Dhabi. Presenter: We'll let you know if Webber manages to take it out. OK time to get you thinking with a fruity quiz. Quiz 2 The question is: Which is a native fruit sometimes hear of them being tur ned in quandong pies. Well our next s tory is about another fruit; mangoes. The Au ssie mango season has start ed and according to some farmers they can be a bit unpredictable. Mangoes are pretty fu ssy about weather conditions and where they're grown. So Kirsty went on the hunt to find out why mangoes sometimes get the grumps. KIRSTY BENNETT, REPORTER: It's man go madness in some parts of Australia. The first mangoes started rolling onto supermarket shelves around September. And growers have been busy harvesting and carting them off for us to enjoy. The trouble is, not all mangoes are happy mangoes. Some of them can be very fussy about where they live! To find out what their problem is, let's check out Australia's climate. At the bottom, there's the temperate zone and that usually means a cool wet winter and a hot dry summer. As you move further up the country, t he climate is kind of the opposite. In Australia's sub -tropical and tropical areas, the winters are warmer and the summers can be warm and really wet. That's at the northern end of places like Queensland, the Northern Te rritory and Western Australia a nd th at's where you can find mangoes! Mangoes aren't a native fruit of Australia. It's believed they were brought over from India back in the 1800s and in some places they have been very happy. To get mangoes, you need a mango tree. You could plonk this seed in the ground anywhere in Australia. It might grow but its survival depends on where you live and the climate. I'll give mine a try to see what happens! Remember, they're very fussy about weather conditions. In the cooler months, the tree blossoms into b unches of tiny flowers. The flowers are pollinated at night by native insects like beetles and blowflies. That's a bit unusual because most other crops rely on honeybees for that job. One or two mangoes will pop up from each bunch of flowers. And once they 're ripe, they're ready to pick. But sometimes mangoes get grumpy and they like to give growers a tough time. In some Queensland orchards this year, mango trees don't have any fruit on them. The season started off great but then the mangoes had a change o f heart. ROBERT CIKES, QUEENSLAND MANGO GROWER: If you had of been here 12 months ago you would've been amazed just how many mangoes were hanging on these trees but this year's an entirely different story. KIRSTY: So why are these mangoes being so hard t o keep happy? Well it's a mystery that growers have been trying to work out for years. We know mangoes are really fussy about the weather conditions. On the one hand, they like tropical areas because they don't like the cold. But on the other hand, if it's not cold enough the trees won't flower - so no fruit! MICHAEL McDOUALL, QUEENSLAND MANGO GROWER: This is a class example of what happens with a poor fruit set and flowering there's the flower and no mangoes. MARLINA WHOP, JOURNALIST: So the majority of trees are looking like that are they? MICHAEL McDOUALL, QUEENSLAND MANGO GROWER: yeah three quarters of the trees, some trees are very very poor, some trees have none, some trees have half a crop. KIRSTY: So it's still a mystery that growers would love t o solve. In the meantime all they can do is hope that next year's mangoes will want to come out and party. Closer Well tha t's all we have for you today. We'll see "}
