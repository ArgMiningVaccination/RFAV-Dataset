She felt nauseous and foggy, and no doctor seemed able to help. \"I felt like I was as drunk as a thousand men [and] I had their hangovers all at once,\" she said. \"I had been to allergists and they just said, 'No, I've got no idea, you have to find out what's going on yourself.' \"I stopped dairy. I stopped eating seafood, gluten, all of the things you kind of know about, but nothing made any difference.\" Eventually she was diagnosed with mammalian meat allergy (MMA), sometimes also called alpha-gal allergy or syndrome. It is a condition which flared up anytime she consumed a product that contained anything from mammals like cattle, pigs or sheep. She discovered that a tick bite years earlier had led her to develop the allergy. Elizabeth has now been living with MMA for 12 years. She says it's been hard on her young family, who have all had to adjust their lifestyle to accommodate her needs. Simple things like attending a barbecue and inhaling meat fumes or petting the family dog can have severe consequences. \"If I don't wash my hands straight away after petting them, after about four hours I just really ache and feel a bit festy ... especially if they lick,\" she said, while playing with her family dog on their 7-hectare property at Hannam Vale, north-west of Taree on the New South Wales mid-north coast. Elizabeth has since set up a Facebook group to support Australians with MMA, to help people share ideas for food and medications that are safe. The number of people turning to social media to find out more about MMA continues to grow. 'Like I was going to die' In the nearby Nambucca Valley, Joanna Becker also spent years trying to work out what was going on with her health. \"I discovered that I had it [MMA] entirely by accident,\" she said. \"A friend ... was eating a meat pie and he noticed me trying not to vomit. And he laughed and said, 'Jo, do you have meat allergy?' And I said, 'What's that?' \"For the meat allergies like red meat, it was more borderline anaphylaxis with huge adrenaline surges and the vomiting and the convulsing and my head spinning with vertigo and total disorientation and a feeling like I was going to die, a real impending sense of doom.\" Joanna's family live on a rural property that she says has become \"covered in ticks\". \"We didn't have ticks noticeable on our property at all in the first five years that we were here, didn't see them at all. \"And in the last three years with La Ni\u00f1a and the rain event we became obsessed with finding them because we're finding them on all the animals. \"We've never had as many ticks here. We've never seen this many. And it's not just our farm. It's everywhere in this valley.\" Everyone in her family has had to change their lives because of her allergy. Crucial to that is the family veggie patch, which gives them control over exactly what they're eating, and what goes into it. \"You'd think having meat allergy I'd only be allergic to meat but it can also be vegetables that have been grown in meat compost, like say blood and bone.\" Joanna and her family catch their own fish when they can, and have developed relationships with local producers who know their needs when they can't. Life-saving medicine can be dangerous for MMA sufferers Mammalian Meat Allergy (MMA) was discovered in 2007 by Australian allergy specialist Sheryl van Nunen. Professor van Nunen said like most allergies, there was a broad range of how people with MMA could react. \"A milder systemic reaction would be generalised welts ranging through to closure of your throat and breathing difficulty and impending loss of consciousness and passing out needing resuscitation,\" she said. \"Unfortunately it can be lethal in a very tiny minority of people.\" People who contract MMA need to radically rearrange their diets to cut out products which will make them sick, but often products like jelly lollies, which contain gelatine made from animal skin or bones, can catch people out. It's not just food sources that can set off the allergy. Medicines from new flu vaccines to snake anti-venoms can all contain animal products and cause life-threatening reactions for MMA sufferers. \"The mammalian allergen is in a number of medical products; for example, there's an anti-cancer drug which is a magic bullet for people with colon cancer and head and neck cancer, but unfortunately injected intravenously,\" Professor van Nunen said. \"This can be a life-threatening experience having this treatment.\" Local GP expects more cases Trevor Cheney has worked as a GP for 22 years in Bellingen, a small town in a green valley not far from the NSW mid-north coast. Although he had no hard numbers, Dr Cheney said there had \"certainly\" been an increase in presentations of people with MMA. \"What I can't say for sure is whether that's an increase in the frequency, or it's actually now that we're more aware, [that] we're actually finding people who were previously sick for unknown reasons and we're identifying them,\" he said. Dr Cheney thinks it's possible people could have been suffering from MMA for years and not known why they were regularly feeling sick. \"Some people present with anaphylaxis, which is the severe life-threatening form of allergy and again it's not necessarily time related to the exposure,\" he said. Dr Cheney also lives on a rural property, and has noticed more ticks than usual. \"We're going to see a lot more people getting a lot more tick bites, and some of those people will develop this allergy.\" Recovery is possible One of Dr Cheney's patients has been suffering from MMA for most of her short life. Stella Price, 10, loves nothing more than riding her horse Bodie on her family's property, a 15-minute drive from Bellingen. Stella has to be careful not to get bitten by a tick when she's outside with her horse, but eating the wrong meal could also make her seriously sick. \"I break out in hives, I get all itchy and then I start to get red. And then I turn into a tomato the next day, I look really red,\" she said. Her allergy makes the business of being a 10-year-old much harder. \"If it's the first time for a play date, Mum normally just says, 'These are the things she can't have, these are things she can have.' \"And if it's a sleepover, I sometimes have dinner before I go.\" Dr Cheney said a lot of people did eventually grow out of MMA if they managed it correctly and avoided mammal products. But he said the process could take 10 years. \"I want that to happen. I'm hoping it will eventually happen as I grow older, but right now it's been like eight years or so since I was diagnosed,\" Stella said. \"So I think I still have a few more years to go until I might grow out of it. But I might not and I'm OK with that.\" Three wet summers lead to tick explosion This tick which can cause so much harm is the Australian paralysis tick, or Ixodes holocyclus. It is found across the east coast of Australia, from Melbourne to Cape York, overlapping with where the majority of the Australian population lives, according to Stephen Doggett, director of medical entomology for New South Wales Health Pathology. \"The Australian paralysis tick needs animals but it also needs fairly humid areas to survive,\" Mr Doggett said. \"So areas like the Bellingen Valley, which is quite green and moist, tends to be highly conducive to this particular species.\" Other known hotspots are Sydney's densely populated northern beaches, and other valleys in NSW like the Tweed Valley. \"We've seen three La Ni\u00f1a seasons and that's associated with above-average rainfall conditions,\" Mr Doggett said. \"Ticks just love these conditions. When we get a lot of wet weather, this is often where we see the biggest numbers.\" Mr Doggett said an El Ni\u00f1o cycle, which usually brings drier periods, could help curtail the number of ticks, but because there had been large numbers of the parasites in the previous season, there could be huge amounts of tick larvae now. Professor van Nunen said not every tick would carry the allergen that can cause someone to develop MMA and not every tick bite would lead to the condition. But she said there was a link between the rise in successful fox-baiting programs and the number of MMA cases. She said the ticks started biting native mammals instead of foxes, and needed to make a sugar called alpha gal to adapt to their new food source. It is that alpha gal which is then transferred to a human when a tick bites and can then cause a person to develop MMA. \"The number of people with mammalian meat allergy has exponentially risen, since fox baiting started,\" Professor van Nunen said. What to do if you're bitten by a tick How someone responds to a tick bite can also determine whether they're likely to contract MMA. \"Don't scratch anything you can't see, don't disturb the tick because you'll squirt allergen into you,\" Professor van Nunen said. \"Kill the tick where it is and let it drop off because most people are hopeless at removing ticks. \"Or take yourself off to a health professional who has very fine forceps and can do it in "}
