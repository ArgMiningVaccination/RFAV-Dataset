UPDATES TO 2008 ALL HAZARD MITIGATION PL AN Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Executive Summary November, 2013 i EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan is designed to meet the requirements of the Federal Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (DMA2K ) and provide a useful document to reduce the impact of hazards county- wide . The plan will m eet the Act's hazard mitigation planning regulations that require jurisdictions to have an adopted and Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) approved Hazard Mitigation Plan to be eligible for mitigation grant funding. Although the DMA2K requires loca l governments to only address natural hazards, the Will County Emergency Management Agency thought it was imperative to address all hazards including technological and societal (including terrorism) hazards. The 2013 update to the Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan provide s a first step towards identifying strategies and actions to prepare the community for natural, technological, and societal hazards. T o ensure the integration of the plan into existing emergency management operations and systems, the 20 13 Will County Risk Assessment was updated and incorporated. The 2013 risk assessment consists of three documents: Will County Hazard Analysis dated November , 2013 Will County Terrorism Vulnerability Assessment dated December , 2003 Will Co unty Terrorism Vulnerability Assessment of Critical Infrastructur e Results date d March, 2004 These documents are summarized within the mitigation plan and were a strong component in establishing the plan's goals and objectives as well as identifying specif ic actions outlined in this plan . Emergency Management agencies at all levels of government in Will County realize the inter -dependencies of mitigation with response, recovery, and preparedness functions . This plan identifies select response, recovery, a nd preparedness actions and identifies agencies responsible for these actions. Purpose Over the past two and half decades, the nation has witnessed an alarming increase in the number of and destruction from disaster s. Destruction associated with disaster s has created a significant increase in direct and indirect costs, as well as economic disruption and loss of life. The toll of a disaster on a community extend s far beyond the physical damage, result ing in long term disruption of local and regional economies. The events of September 11th, 2001, underscored the importance in identifying Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Executive Summary November, 2013 ii emerging threats , while Hurricane Katrina demonstrated the importance of planning and inter -agency coordination for catastrophic disasters at a local level. The intent of DMA2K is to control the cost of federal disaster assistance by initiating a sustained , national program for pre -disaster hazard mitigation planning . In order to be eligible for mitigation funding through FEMA's programs , communities must develop and ado pt a hazard mitigation plan. This program enable s participating communities to implement planned, cost -effective mitigation measures before and after an event. The mitigation planning and hazard analysis simulation process in this plan identif ied and pr ioritiz ed the steps and actions to mitigate the impact of all the various categories of hazards . This process identified gaps in existing documents and current operations and practices. The communities of Will County are familiar with the impacts of disa sters and recognize that a disaster could occur with little or no warning. Planning for a sustainable, resilient, and prepared community is essential to reduce damages to homes, facilities, and infrastructure; prevent loss of life; minimize disruption of essential and critical services ; and maintain continuity of the local economy and government operations . Plan Review Tool To ensure that the updated Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan meets the requirements of DMA2K, the Mitigation Projec t Team cross -referenced the All Hazard Mitigation Plan with FEMA's Local Mitigation Plan Review Tool . FEMA uses the tool to evaluate mitigation plans. In addition, the tool identifies where each plan element is located within the plan document. The tool can also be used as part of an interna l quality assurance procedure. Public Involvement The broadened scope of an All Hazard Mitigat ion Plan did create challenges due to th e sensitivity of some technological and societal hazard s with regard to sharing sensitive information with the public. Today's society requires communities to control the distribution of sensitive and vital documents since the control of t his information could minimize potential risks. Despite the security issues, the Will County commun ities realize that public involvement is critical to the success of any strategic planning process, including hazard mitigation. It is important for hazard mitigation plans to target concerns, comments, and perception of risk as factors in the creation of Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Executive Summary November, 2013 iii mitigation strategies. To ensure consensus with the public, the Mitigation Project Team developed several mechanisms to secure sensitive information and to still reach out to the public to participate in the Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan. Public input was incorporated into the m itigation plan through various efforts including: Steering Committee - A Mitigation Steering Committee comprised of various professionals with local knowledge and expertise was organized. The Mitigation Steer ing Committee members are identified in Appendix E. Local Input - The Mitigation Steering Committee members met with local organizations and jurisdictions to update them on the progress of the project, as well as to solicit their participation and support of the All Hazard Mitigation Plan to identify potential mitigation projects. Information, comments, concerns, and ideas that would be incorporated into the plan were gathered during these meetings . A summary of these meetings is provided in Appendix E . Expert Guidance - The Mitigation Project Team , composed of CTE/AECOM and the Polis Center, held interviews to solicit input and guidance from experts in given fields and provide modeling of likely hazards . This information and guidance were included in the development of the plan. A summary of these in terviews is provided in Appendices B and E. Workshops - The Hazard Mitigation Steering Committee held mitigation workshop s to review and update the mitigation goals and objectives and to identify mitigation actions to be incorporated into the 2013 Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan . Invitations to attend this workshop were extended to local jurisdictions , various community organizations , and neighboring counties . A summary of meetings and workshops for the update of the plan are provided in Appendix E . Public Meetings - The Hazard Mitigation Steering Committee held a public meeting to inform the public of the All Hazard Mitigation Plan and the mitigation goals and objectives. The intent of this meeting was to provide a forum for the public to share their comments, concerns, and ideas that could be incorporated into the plan. An overview of the All Hazard Mitigation project and a questionnaire was distributed at this meeting, as well as poste d on the Will County Emergency Management Agency (EMA) website . The questionnaire was developed to target the public's Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Executive Summary November, 2013 iv thought on what Will County's greatest risk s are , what they have done to mitigate their home against disasters, and what they would do i f a disaster strikes. Information on this public meeting is provided in Appendix E . The Mitigation Team developed a public survey for the plan update to gauge the concerns of the public, as well as provide feedback to help guide the Committee in identifyi ng potential mitigation actions. The questionnaire was developed to target the public's thought s on what their and their community's greatest risk s are, what they have done to mitigate at their home, and what they would do when a disaster strikes. This questionnaire was available through the Will County EMA website ( http://www.willcountyema.org ) and Facebook page along with jurisdictional websites . This allowed the public to communicate their concerns, comment s, and ideas on what their community and/or Will County can do to mitigate hazards. A sample of the website and Facebook postings along with the results of the public survey are found in Appendix E. The public was also given an opportunity to review the u pdated plan which was posted on the Will County EMA and jurisdictional websites along with the ability for the public to posts comments on a Survey Monkey link. The website posting can be found in Appendix E. Mitigation Goals and Objectives Through these efforts, All Hazard Mitigation Goals and Objectives were developed and updated. Goals define the expectations of the plan and serve as general guidelines . They are typically broad policy- type statements, long term , and represent global visions . Objectiv es are s trategies or implementation steps to attain an identified goal . Unlike goals, objectives are specific and measurable. The goals and objectives were identified during the risk assessment and molded throughout the planning process, then finalized and updated during the Mitigation Workshop s. Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Executive Summary November, 2013 v Goal #1: Protect and secure life and property . Objectives: Increase public education and awareness of all hazards and what they can do to protect and secure their community. Implement effective approac hes to protect neighborhoods, buildings, and critical facilities and infrastructure from all hazards. Nurture and support local and regional organizations that have mission s that fulfill this goal.

Leverage existing opportunities to upgrade aging equipment and infrastructure that are critical to emergency management. Encour age and support the professional development fields relevant to Emergency Management. Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Executive Summary November, 2013 vi Goal #3: Ensure economic stability, preserve cultural resources, and improve quality of life throughout Will County. Objectives: Nurture and support strat egic local and regional private/ public partnerships to limit or minimize the impact from a disaster to key employers and from market sectors. Work w ith local universities, private/non- profit organizations, and other organizations to identify opportunities to implem ent mitigation. Promote and nurture mitigation actions that facilitate security to private and public sectors while leveraging available funding. Increase readiness of the private sector within Will County and promote private sector readiness within the region. Goal #4: Develop, promote, and integrate mitigation actions. Objectives: Assist Will County and its participating jurisdictions in the development of mitigation proposals and identify source s of federal funding. Identify and facilitate mitiga tion opportunities pertinent to the locale with internal, neighboring, and regional partners. Assist essential and critical facilities (hospitals, universities, utilities, and eligible private/non- profits) to identify mitigation opportunities. Engrain miti gation strategies and actions into everyday planning and project development. Integrate mitigation projects with other feder al funding sources (FEMA, DHS, US EPA, HUD, etc) and projects in order to maximize efficiency and program eligibility. Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Executive Summary November, 2013 vii Goal #5: Take advantage of opportunities offered by growth while also protecting natural systems and natural resources. Objectives: Incorporate hazard mitigation practices into the activities of other C ounty departments and Will County jurisdictions . Integrate m itigation actions into existing and future opportunities, projects, and developments. Focus on flood hazard mitigation actions that can increase open space and meet targets for natural environment sustainability. Planning Process The Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan process involves four distinct phases that will enable communities to articulate their risks and identify and develop mitigation actions for all hazards . These phases are : Organize Resources Assess Risks Identify Mitigation A ctions Implement the Mitigation Plan Organize Resources The vital component of this effort was to identify the Mitigation Steering Committee. The Mitigation Steering Committee acted as a point of contact for the various interested groups and provided supp ort of the Mitigation Planning process. Identification of this core group is important in ensuring implementation and support of the Mitigation Plan. T he following characteristics were considered when soliciting participation: Ability to speak for the or ganization; Provide visionary characteristics; Have a desire and time to commit, and; Have an u nderstanding of local politics and issues . Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Executive Summary November, 2013 viii Will County EMA chaired this committee and representatives from Will County departments provided strategic guidance an d were active throughout the development of the hazard mitigation plan. Many of the Will County representatives were also members of local organizations that have relevance to the Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan and its update . Risk Ass essment The County government recognized the importance of identifying and analyzing all of Will Cou nty's hazards; therefore, in 2013 Will County reviewed and updated the hazard risk analysis . The 2013 risk analysis consist s of three documents: Will Count y Hazard Analysis dated November, 2013 Will County Terrorism Vulnerability Assessment dated Decembe r, 2003 Will County Terrorism Vulnerability Assessment of Critical Infrastructure Results dated March, 2004 These risk analysis documents were the fundamenta l building block s of the Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan. As part of the hazard mitigation plan, these risk analys es were updated and summarized without detailing information that is sensitive to local security. The assessment and ana lysis of the vulnerability to the County is a definitive measure of the risk associated with each individual hazard. The Risk Assessment describes , analyze s, and evaluates the risks facing Will County from three categories of hazards: Natural, Technologi cal, and Societal . The description of each hazard category el aborate s upon and : Defines t he different types of hazards Identif ies historical events that have occurred locally and/or regionally Define s the hazard profiles, parameters, and characteristic s Assess es possible vulnerabilities Determine s probable scen arios Models select hazards Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Executive Summary November, 2013 ix The technological and societal portions of the County -Wide Hazard Risk Assessment contain sensitive information and therefore are marked \"FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - NOT FOR PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION\". The risks include the following: Mitigation Actions and Implementation The updated Mitigation Action Plan identifies mitigation actions intended to reduce loss from future hazard events throughout the County. The mitigation strategies were developed from the risk assessmen t and the public participation process. Each mitigation strategy describes the problem or opportunity, how to implement it, funding sources, and responsible agencies. Mitigation strategies were defined and prioritized primarily through a formalized works hop with steering committee members and jurisdictional representatives . To support the mitigation actions identified, this plan also identifies select response, recovery, and preparedness actions that are related to the overall mitigation strategy. The initial selection and prioritization of these strategies was drafted by the mitigation steering committee , using the following criteria to identify mitigation strategies and actions that: Address plan goals and objectives . Take advantage of opportunities presented by on -going or prospective initiatives, programs, and activities related to emergency management, public safety, homeland security . Are within the capabilities to execute the mitigation action. Offer a significant benefit to the community in relation to its cost. Natural Hazards Technological Hazards Societal Hazards Tornado Infrastructure Failure Terrorist Attack Winter/Ice Storm Hazardous Materials - Fixed Site Enemy Attack Thunderstorm Nuclear Power Plant Accident Public Health Flood Pipelines Civil Disturbance Earthquake Hazardous Materials - Drought Transportation Accident Flash Flood Non-Hazardous Materials High Temperatures Transportation Accident Fire Dam Failure Land Subsidence Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Executive Summary November, 2013 x Have an identified funding source or sources. Have an identified lead agency with appropriate jurisdictional authority to coordinate implementation. Have an identified schedule for implementation. A benefit/ cost analysis is an important component in the hazard mitigation planning process. As the scope of mitigation actions are defined and costs are developed, the Mitigation Steering Committee will work with other departments and local jurisdictions to analyze these actions based on FEMA' s benefit cost methodology. This analysis will assist in determining the actions necessary to effectively minimize costs and prevent damage from future hazard s. Implementation, Monitoring, and Maintenance Will County EMA will maintain and update the 2013 Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan and continue to encourage participa tion by all communities in the C ounty. The update of this plan will occur every five years as mandated by DMA2K with input from participating communities . The Will County Mitigation Steering Committee will gather each year to asse ss the status of the mitigation actio ns. Public input will continuously be solicited via the Will County EMA website as well as through local organizations and public -private partnerships . Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 1: Introduction November, 2013 Chapter 1 - 1 CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION Will County is one of the nation's fastest growing counties . It is all too familiar with natural disasters, the existing risk of technological hazards, and the growing threat of societal hazards. After decade s of gradual change, urban sprawl is moving into the farmland areas . In the last twenty years , the population of the C ounty increased by 320,000 (89% growth) . This population was attracted to t he County because of opportunities that developed due to the expansion of businesses and homes. Although many residents welcome this growth as a sign of prosperity and progress, it also results in increase d traffic, greater demand on infrastructure, and a loss of open space. The most devastating impact can be one that is not realized each day, but when a disaster strikes. Although disasters have occurred in the County, Will County and its jurisdictions have not experience d a catastrophic natural event, a terrorist attack, or an incident of national significance. Despite this , emergency management agencies throughout the County recognize that a disaster could occur in the future with little or no warning. The development of open space and farmland , increasing dependency on technology, and new developing threats gr eatly enhance the possibility and impact of a disaster. Planning for a sustainable, resilient, and prepared community is essential to prevent loss of life, disruption of essential and critical services, economic and business interruption, and damages to homes, facilities, and infrastructure. Most importantly , this plan will assist the communities of Will County in recognizing its vulnerabilities and preparing for future recovery efforts. Over the past t hree decades, the nation has witnessed an alarming number of disasters incurring substantial destruction . Destruction associated with d isasters has created a significant increase in direct and indirect costs, as well as economic disruption and loss of life.

As a result, C ongress passed Public Law 106- 390, The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (DMA2K). The intent of DMA2K was to control federal cost s of disaster assistance by initiating a national, sustained program for pre -disaster hazard mitigation. This program enable s participating communities to impl ement planned, pre -identified, cost -effective mitigation measures before or after an event. In order to be eligible for mitigation funding through FEMA programs , communities must develop and adopt a hazard mitigation plan. The Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan covers those jurisdictions that participated in the hazard mitigation pla nning process . Will County EMA is the local organization that provides emergency management services throughout Will County. Will County EMA applied for and received funding to develop the 2008 hazard mitigation plan and worked closely with local jurisdi ctions, municipalities and townships throughout th e mitigation planning process and plan update . Resolution of Adoption This Plan serves to recommend mitigation measures for Will County. Adoption of this plan by the Will County Board and the participatin g communities initiates the implementation of these recommendations. Adoption is also a requirement for recognition of the plan by mitigation funding programs. The adoption of this Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan was done by resolution of the County Board. A sample r esolution of adoption is included as Appendix A of the p lan. Resolutions of adoption by Will County and participating jurisdictions will become part of this plan as they are adopted. Through these resolutions of adoption, each j urisdiction will certify their agreement with the risk assessment and the mitigation goals, objectives, strategies, implementation, monitoring, and update schedule. The municipal, fire protection districts, colleges, and other agencies' resolutions should adopt each action item that is pertinent to the community and assign a person responsible for it. Once the state and federal reviewers certify the p lan approval, Will County will forward the plan to each participating jurisdiction for formal adopti on. Copies of these resolutions will be held on file with the Will County E MA. With adoption, the County and each municipality, agency, or institution are individually eligible to apply for FEMA mitigation grant funding. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 1: Introduction November, 2013 Chapter 1 - 3 Planning Process Methods The Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan process involves four distinct phases that will enable the communities within Will County to articulate their risks and identify and develop mitigation actions. These phases include: Organize Resources Assess Risks Identify Mitigation Actions Develop and Implement the Mitigation Plan Organize Resources Will County EMA served as the coordinating body for the planning process. They collaborated closely with the communities of Will County and local organizati ons. Furthermore, Will County EMA solicited participation from surrounding communities to be involved throughout the process. The Will County Mitigation Steering Comm ittee was actively involved in all of the stages of the planning process: hazard ident ification, risk assessment, mitigation strategy development, and mitigation action identification. D isaster s often cross county boundaries; therefore, Will County solicited the participation of several jurisdictions that straddle the boundaries of the Cou nty to improve the opportunity to ide ntify and implement regional mitigation actions. Several advantages of this relationship include: Collaboration allows for resource sharing between communities a nd neighboring counties . Issues that affect multiple juri sdictions can be discussed and leveraged together to show a greater benefit of a mitigation action. Reduce d duplication of efforts. Establishment of r elationships prior to an event occurring. These relationships are fundamental to emergency management act ivities during all phases: preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation. Many individuals and groups were crucial contributors to the creation of this plan. The following identifies them and their role in the process. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 1: Introduction November, 2013 Chapter 1 - 4 Will County Emergency Managemen t Agency Will County EMA works closely with all jurisdiction al emergency mana gement agencies throughout the County to provide emergency management services . Will County EMA applied for and received funding from IEMA and FEMA to develop the 2008 hazard mi tigation plan. Will County EMA was the lead for the 2013 update of the original plan and chaired the Will County Mitigation Steering Committee. Will County EMA served as the coordinating body for the planning process and collaborated closely with other County departments, local jurisdictions, local organizations, and the public. Furthermore, Will County EMA solicited participation from the public and surrounding communities to be involved throughout the process. Mitigation Project Team The Mitigation Pr oject Team consisted of a core team with mitigation and recovery experience, as well as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis and H azards U.S Multi -hazard (H AZUS -MH) modeling. The Mitigation Project Team was le d by a Certified Emergency and Floodp lain Manager and consisted of professionals with diverse backgrounds in emergency management, engineering, environmental sciences, and homeland security. GIS analysis and HAZUS -MH modeling were performed by the Polis Center (Polis), a not -for-profit, university -based organization with staff dedicated to researching and applying GIS technology . Will County Mitigation Steering Committee The Will County Mitigation Steering Committee was comprised of officials from various Will County departments that are acti vely involved with local organizations and are conduits to local jurisdictions : Will County EMA Will County Engineering and Transportation Will County Department of Planning Will County GIS Participating Communities The Mitigation Steering Committee solic ited the participation of local jurisdictions throughout the mitigation planning process. County and local jurisdictions were invited to participate in the plan update process. This includes the thirty -seven municipalities that have all or some of their m unicipal limits within Will County. The municipalities that are predominantly within surrounding counties but whose municipal limits expand into Will County are denoted (*) in the following table. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 1: Introduction November, 2013 Chapter 1 - 5 The following thirty -seven municipalities were invited to participate by furnishing data, information, ideas, mitigation suggestions, and issues on the topics included within the development of this Plan : City of Aurora * Village of Beecher Village of Bolingbrook Village of Braceville * City of Braidwood Village of Channahon Village of Coal City * City of Crest Hill Village of Crete Village of Diamond * Village of Elwood Village of Frankfort Village of Godley * Village of Homer Glen City of Joliet Village of Lemont * City of Lockport Village of Manhattan Village of Minooka * Village of Mokena Village of Monee City of Naperville * Village of New Lenox Village of Orland Park * Village of Park Forest * Village of Peotone Village of Plainfield Village of Rockdale Village of Romeoville Village of Sauk Village * Village of Shorewood Village of Steger * Village of Symerton Village of Tinley Park * Village of University Park City of Wilmington Village of Woodridge * * Jurisdictions that border or have only a portion of their corporate limits in Will County and may choos e not to adopt this Plan. Jurisdictions participate d in a variety of ways as outlined in the following table. Jurisdiction participation was defined by the Mitigation Steering Committee during the planning process. Collectively, it was decided that each jurisdiction must meet one of the following criteria to be included within the plan. Provide representation during at least one planning meeting Submit an inventory of plans, data, and reports relevant to hazard mitigation planning Review and complete the Hazard Mitigation Action form Identify and delineate natural, technological, and societal hazards throughout Will County Identify critical \"at risk\" structures and facilities Develop community wide mitigation goals Submit techniques to plan for, reduce, a nd manage expected losses Provide technical and financial assistance and incentives to facilitate loss reduction projects Review and comment on the draft plan Incorporate the plan into existing planning efforts Formally adopt the plan Participate in plan m aintenance through yearly reviews and five year updates The municipalities listed above along with County and other stakeholders were invited to three Mitigation Plan Update Workshops. After each workshop, all jurisdictions were provided by email worksh op Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 1: Introduction November, 2013 Chapter 1 - 6 materials and suggested updates collected during the workshop for review. Those who were not able to attend a workshop were encouraged to provide their comments and questions. Not all of the jurisdictions were able to attend the workshops, but of thos e that did, many submitted comments on the workshop results by email, telephone, or contact with Mitigation Steering Committee members. Those jurisdictions that did not attend any workshop or respond to workshop follow -up emails were contacted numerous times by telephone, email, and face -to-face at other meetings. The importance of the mitigation plan update and their participation was stressed in these contacts. Most of the jurisdictions whose municipal limits are within Will County that did not respond are small communities that only have part -time or volunteer staff. A number of jurisdictions whose municipal limits are predominantly outside of Will County participated in the development of the plan update . Those jurisdictions that did not are involved with the Hazard Mitigation Plan of their respective county. These jurisdictions were aware of Will County's progress in updating the plan and indicated they were following the progress through the email updates. Representatives from jurisdictions withi n and outside Will County who met the participation requirement by participat ing in meetings, document review, and information gathering are identified in the following table. Additional information on jurisdictional participation may be found in Appendix E (see E -9).

A summary and explanation of these meetings is provided in Appendix E . Expertise Interviews The Mitigation Project Team interviewed and solicited input from a variety of experts in the field of engineering, natural hazards, technological hazards, terrorism , etc. A summary and explanation of these meetings is provided in Appendix E . Public Involvement The broad scope of the Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan did create challenges due to the nature of technological and societal hazards and the ability to share sensitive information with the public. Today's society prohibits openly sharing vital documents and information since this information could identify potential vulnerabilities. Despite the security issues, the Mitigation Team developed several mechanisms to secure sensitive information and still reach out to the public to participate i n the Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan . Public input was incorporated into the p lan through various efforts. A Mitigation Steering Committee comprised of various professionals with local knowledge and expertise was organized. The Mitigation Steering Committee members are identified in Appendi x E. The Mitigation Project Team held meetings with various governing entities and jurisdictions to understand their risks and to gather information, as well as comments, concerns, and ideas that would be incorporated into the plan. Those attending includ ed various professionals in emergency services, engineering and planning ; local jurisdictions ; County depart ments; and community organizations . A summary of these meetings is provided in Appendix E . The Mitigation Project Team held interviews to solicit input and guidance from experts in given fields. This information and guidance was included in the development of the plan. A summary of these interviews is provided in Appendix E . The Hazard Mitigation Steering Committee held workshop s to review and define the mitigation goals and objectives and to review and identify mitigation actions to be incorporated into the Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan. Invitations were extended to various Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 1: Introduction November, 2013 Chapter 1 - 10 community organizations to attend this workshop. A copy of the Hazard Mitigation Action form that was distributed is provided in Appendix D. Will County EMA held a public meeting to allow the publi c to participate in the 2008 Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan . This public meeting enabled the community to learn about the hazards and the mitigation planning process. It also allowed them to communicate their concerns, comments, and ideas on what their community and/or Will County can do to mitigate all hazards. A copy of the public notice i s provided in Appendix E . Will County EMA posted an overview of the County- Wide All Hazard Mitigation project and a public survey on the Will County and jurisdictional websites . The questionnaire was developed to target the public's thoughts on what their and their community 's greatest risk is, what they have done to mitigate at their home, and what they would do when a disaster strikes. A copy of the survey and results is provided in Appendix E . A draft of the 2013 Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan was posted on the Will County EMA and jurisdictional website s for public review and comment. Resources The Will County Planning Committee utilized a variety of planning documents and technical data, reports and studies to direct the plans devel opment. Resources includ e land use plans, comprehensive plans, city ordinances, building codes, zoning ordinances , historical research documents , subject -specific text books , interviews with local officials , interview s with regional experts , local plannin g, engineering, GIS data, and emergency management documents . The planning process also incorporated the existing 2008 Will County Hazard Mitigation Plan and elements of the 2010 and 2013 State Hazard Mitigation plan into the creation of this update along with a variety of FEMA reference documents. When applicable, the Project Team utilized HAZUS -MH. HAZUS -MH is a GIS based loss estimation model developed by FEMA. HAZUS -MH was used to model the county- wide impacts of historical earthqu akes and flooding events .

The All Hazard Risk Assessment summarizes the 2013 Will Cou nty Hazard Analysis and further describes , analyze s, and assess es the county- wide risks from three categories of hazards: natural, t echnological, and s ocietal . The description of each hazard category elaborate s upon and define s the different types of haz ards, identif ies historical events that have occurred locally and/or regionally, define s the hazard profiles, parameters, and characteristics; assess es possible vulnerabilities; determine s probable scenarios; and model s select hazards. The associated risks for each hazard were defined through the following process: 1. Identify, define, and describe each hazard 2. Determine hazard profile and characteristics 3. Identify historical occurrences 4. Analyze and assess hazard risk Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 1: Introduction November, 2013 Chapter 1 - 13 In order to effectively and efficiently int egrate existing documents and operations, the 2013 Will County Hazard Analysis was incorporated into the Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan. This allow ed Will County to identify mitigation objectives, strategies, and actions that address a ll of Will County's risks. The Will County Terrorism Vulnerability Assessment and the Terrorism Vulnerability Assessment of Critical Infrastructure Results were not referenced in this document due to the sensitive information that is contained in these re ports. The 20 13 Will County Hazard Analysis utilized a formal, structured procedure to develop mitigation and emergency operation plans. FEMA has developed a process for assessing and evaluating hazards. Will County utilized this process for assessing an d evaluating hazards in order to promote a common base for completing the analysis b y defining criteria and providing a scoring system. Four criteria were used to describe and assess the potential hazards, the four criteria include: History - past record of occurrences of the specified hazard. It is a guide of what has occurred in the past but is not a guarantee of what may occur in the future. Vulnerability - pertains to the people that might be killed, injured, or contaminated and to property that might be destroyed, damaged, or contaminated due to the occurrences of a specified hazard. Maximum Threat - consists of the impacts from a 'worst case' scenario of a specified hazard and is where the greatest impact to people and property is expected and assess ed. Probability - refers to the likelihood of the occurrence of a specified hazard. It is expressed as the number of chances per year that an event of a specific intensity will occur. To comple ment the 2013 R isk Analysis, the methods employed by the Illin ois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA) and FEMA were incorporated to provide consistency between all levels of government. The following graph illustrates the risk analysis based on the probability/history of the event and the vulnerability/maximum threat (or impact) of the hazard. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 1: Introduction November, 2013 Chapter 1 - 14 Identify Mitigation Goals, Objectives, and Actions The Mitigation Goals, Objectives, and Actions address the intent of this document and the actions to reduce lo ss from future hazard events throughout the County. Mitigation strategies were reviewed, defined , and prioritized primarily through Mitigation W orkshop s with committee members and participating jurisdictions . The Mitigation Workshop participants were encouraged to identify mitigation strategies that had an all hazards impact or targeted the community's greatest risks . Potential strategies were developed using criteria developed by FEMA. These evaluation criteria consist of public support, technical feasib ility, staffing, funding, maintenance requiremen ts, political support, legal authority, and cost effectiveness. The mitigation plan identifies mitigation actions and implementation strategies. The mitigation actions and strategies were developed from the risk assessment and the public participation pro cess. The mitigation actions were prioritized by those hazards that have the greatest risk (i.e. significant probability of occurring and a significant impact) . The Mitigation Steering Committee was encouraged to not limit their focus of mitigation actio ns to these hazards. The following graph illustrates th e relationship . Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 1: Introduction November, 2013 Chapter 1 - 15 Each mitigation strategy describes the opportunity, how to implement it, funding sources, and responsible agencies. Problem/Opportunity : This describes either a problem or a pos sible opportunity to reduce risk. Implementation Strategy : Each mitigation strategy includes ideas to implement and accomplish the specific project and potential resources, which may include grant programs or human resources. Lead Agency : This is the age ncy or agencies that will organize resources, find appropriate funding, or oversee project implementation, monitoring and evaluation. Funding: This offers suggestions on potential financial resources for implementing the mitigation strategy. This includes funding from government agencies as well as various different types of grants. Timeline : This estimates the amount of time it will take to begin implementation of each strategy. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 1: Introduction November, 2013 Chapter 1 - 16 Mitigation Plan Development The Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan documents the mitigation planning process and addresses the elements required in 44 CFR Part 201.6(c). Although the DMA2K requires local governments to only address natural hazards, Will County EMA thought it was imperative to address all hazards, i ncluding technological and societal (which includes terrorism) hazards. Will County EMA also recognize s the importance of integrating mitigation with other state and federal directives . Plan Monitoring and Maintenance The Mitigation Steering Committee , with support of participating jurisdictions , will review the plan annually or within 45 days of any disaster event. They will regularly review each goal and objective to determine its relevan ce to the changing situation throughout Will County . They will also monitor and evaluate the mitigation strategies in this plan to ensure that the document reflects current hazard analyses, development trends, code changes , and risk analyses and perceptions. The committee will hear progress reports from the parties r esponsible for the various implementation actions to monitor progress and create future action plans and mitigation strategies. They will review the plan when other plans are being updated, such as capital improvement project plans and comprehensive plan updates to ensure consistency. The participating jurisdictions and Will County recognize the importance of effectively communicating with the public about the community's hazards and what they can do to be prepared and mitigate their threats. Continued pu blic involvement is an important part of implementing, monitoring , and maintaining the Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan . Will County EMA has provided a forum to educate the public and solicit input , in order to effectively involve reside nts in the update and review of the plan , as members of the Planning Committee. Will County EMA , with active participation of County departments, local jurisdictions, and organizations, wi ll maintain and update the Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan. The update of this plan will occur every five years as mandated by DMA2K. The Hazard Mitigation Steering Committee will continue to solicit additional members and gather each year to asses s the status of the mitigation actions. Public input will be solicited throughout the year through a variety of methods that includ e public meetings, website postings, and other means to provide a conduit to the community . Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 1: Introduction November, 2013 Chapter 1 - 17 FEMA Mitigation Plan Review Tool The Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan is designed to meet the requirements of DMA2K, while also developing a useable document to identify opportunities to alleviate the impact and/or consequence of hazards on all of the communities of Will County. To ensure that the plan meets the requi rements of DMA2K, the Mitigation Project Team cross -referenced the All Hazard Mitigation Plan with FEMA's Local Mitigation Plan Review Tool . FEMA uses th is tool to evaluate mitigation plans. In addition, the tool identifies where each plan element is loc ated within the plan document. The review tool can also be used as part of an internal quality assurance procedure. Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 2: Will County Community Overview November, 2013 Chapter 2 - 1 CHAPTER 2: WILL COUNTY COMMUNITY OVERVIEW A community overview is presented to provide background information in order to put the risk assessment in to perspective. The community overview also aids in the evaluation of proposed mitigation measures. To ensure the integration of the Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan with other C ounty, jurisdictional, and emergency management planning documents, portions of this section originat ing from the Will County Hazard Analysis , were updated with recent changes within Will County and the participating jurisdictions and supplemented with information on hazard mitigation planning. Historical Overview The Will County area was inhabited over time by various native American Indian tribes as far back as 3,000 to 4,000 years ago. People were drawn to the area for its abundance of resources and accessibility to other parts of the country. A rich supply of hunting game, timber, fertile soil, and water sources met the needs of the early inhabitants and the old Sauk Trail along with the Des Plaines, DuPage, and Kankakee Rivers af forded routes for travel. The C ounty was formed in 1836 from Cook and Iroquois Counties. The County's name honors Dr. Conrad Will who was a member of the first Constitutional Convention and the Illinois Legislature until his death in 1835. Will County included an area north of the Kankakee River , now part of Kankakee County, but its present boundaries have remained as established in 1852. It was originally divided into ten election districts and seventeen road districts and now consists of twenty- four townships. Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 2: Will County Community Overview November, 2013 Chapter 2 - 2 Will County Municipalities Will County consists of 37 municipalities that range from small farmland communities to large suburban cities. Several of th ese municipalities cross Will County's jurisdictional boundaries into neighboring counties. Will County's M unicipalities: City of Aurora * Village of Beecher Village of Bolingbrook Village of Braceville * City of Braidwood Village of Channahon Village of Coal City * City of Crest Hill Village of Crete Village of Diamond * Village of Elwood Village of Frankfort Village of Godley* Village of Homer Glen City of Joliet Village of Lemont * City of Lockport Village of Manhattan Village of Minooka * Village of Mokena Village of Monee City of Naperville * Village of New Lenox Village of Orland Park * Village of Park Forest * Village of Peotone Village of Plainfield Village of Rockdale Village of Romeoville Village of Sauk Village * Village of Shorewood Village of S teger * Village of Symerton Village of Tinley Park Village of University Park* City of Wilmington Village of Woodridge * * Jurisdictions that border or have only a portion of their corporate limits within Will County Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 2: Will County Community Overview November, 2013 Chapter 2 - 3 Geography and Climate Will County, covering an area of 846 square miles, is one o f Illinois' 102 counties. The C ounty is part of the Chicago Metropolitan area, located in northeastern Illinois. Joliet, the county seat, is located approximately forty miles southwe st of Chicago at an altitude of approximatel y 600 feet above sea level . The continental glaciers that covered Illinois thousands of years ago created t he relatively flat terrain. As the Wisconsonian , the last glacier in Illinois , retreated and melted , the lakes and rivers that were important to the County 's early inhabitants were formed. Today, water transportation remains important for the shipment of goods as the County's three main rivers : Des Plaines, DuPage, and Kankakee . These rivers run along the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal and Illinois and Michigan (I&M) Canal and provide a connection between the Great Lakes and Gulf of Mexico. After glaciation, prairies formed over most of Illinois. The morainal and Grand Prairie sections predominated in W ill County. The windblown silt deposited during glacial retreat and prairie vegetation created a mollisol or dark -colored soil found in the northern half or two -thirds of Illinois. This type of soil is conducive to the growing of corn, oats, soybean, whe at, and hay that are grown by today's farmers. The area experiences a humid continental climate with hot summers and cold winters. Three air masses influence the County's climate. Generally in the winter, cold , dry air flows down from Canada. The summe r months experience warm, very humid air from the Gulf of Mexico. Dry, warm air from the Pacific Ocean occurs especially in the fall. Will County Township Map Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 2: Will County Community Overview Novembe r, 2013 Chapter 2 - 4 Maximum temperatures in the summer average 85\u00b0 F in July, but temperatures have been known to reach into the 100's. M inimum temperatures in the winter ave rage 12\u00b0 F in January; however, lows have occurred in the -20's. Humidity in the summer and wind in the winter intensify the problems of extreme temperature that endanger the population. Average rainfall for the are a is 35.8\" and average snowfall is 38.6\". The length of the growing season is approximately 165 days with the last spring frost occurring around May 1st and the first fall frost occurring near October 15th of each year.

Temperature extremes and storms are responsible for deaths and health problems. Each year, 20 to 30 deaths in Illinois are attributed to floods, winter storms, tornadoes, and lightning. Heat and cold waves are other climate hazards associated with high death tolls. Illinois experienced two of its most de adly heat waves during the 1990s. The 1995 heat wave, the deadliest on record, led to 753 Illinois deaths. That heat wave and another in 1999 caused major power outages in the Chicago metropolitan area. Annually, 74 deaths are attributed to heat and 18 deaths are attributed to cold, far exceeding deaths due to tornadoes, lightning, and floods. Joliet Climate Graph - Illinois Climate Chart Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 2: Will County Community Overview Novembe r, 2013 Chapter 2 - 5 Flooding is the single most damaging weather hazard in Illinois. Ever -increasing heavy precipitation since the 1940s has led to increased flood peaks on Illinois ' rivers. Flood losses recorded in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Nation Climatic Data Center (NCDC) database exceeded $5.5 billion in Illinois between 1993 and 2012. Since 1965, flooding was either the main or a significant contributing factor for 32 out of the 52 Presidential Disaster Declarations declared in Illinois. Climatic Controls Five factors control the continental climate of Illinois: sun, weather systems, topography, urban areas, and Lake Michigan. Two major co ntrols are latitude (reflecting the amount of solar input) and weather systems (air masses and cyclonic storms). The effects of topography, Lake Michigan, and urban areas are of lesser significance because they influence local climate conditions, rather than conditions statewide. Climatic Controls Sun Primary energy source for virtually all weather phenomena, in large part , determines air temperatures and seasonal variations Solar energy is three to four times greater in early summer than in early winter at Illinois' mid-latitude location, which results in warm summers and cold winters when combined with the state's inland location Weather Systems Second major factor affecting the state's climate Create wide variety of weather conditions that occur almost daily as a result of varying air masses and passing storm systems Polar jet stream often is located near or over Illinois, especially in fall, winter, and spring, and is the focal point for the creation and movement of low -pressure storm systems, characte rized by clouds, winds, and precipitation Settled weather associated with high pressure systems is generally ended every few days by the passage of low -pressure systems Topography Shawnee Hills extend across southern Illinois and have elevations 500 to 900 feet higher than the surrounding terrain This change in elevation is enough to increase annual precipita tion by about 10 to 15 percent Urban Areas Buildings, parking lots, roads, and industrial activities make the urban climate noticeably different than that of surrounding rural areas Chicago tends to be warmer by 2\u00b0F, on average, especially at night Also enhance summertime precipitation downwind of the city and cause changes in humidity, cloudiness, wind speed and direction Lake Michigan Influences the climate of northeastern Illinois, especially Chicago Large thermal mass of the lake tends to moderate temperatures, causing cooler summers and warmer winters Major benefit is cool lake breezes that provide some relief from summer heat Also tends to increase cloudiness in the area and suppress summer precipitation Winter precipitation is enhanced by lake -effect snows that occur when winds blow from the north or northeast Winds allow air to pass over the relatively warm lake, boosting storm system energy and water content, l eading to increased snowfall Source: Illinois Climate Atlas.

Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 2: Will County Community Overview Novembe r, 2013 Chapter 2 - 6 Illinois Temperature Average annual temperatures range from 48\u00b0F (north) to 58\u00b0 F (south), with highs ranging from 57\u00b0F (north) to 67\u00b0F (south). Average winter highs range from the 30s (north) to the mid- 40s (south), while average lows range from the teens (north) to the upper 20s (south). Average summer highs are in the 80s, while l ows are in the 60s across the state. Both spring and fall have more moderate temperatures. Average spring highs range from 57\u00b0F (north) to 67\u00b0F (south), while average lows range from 36\u00b0F (north) to 48\u00b0F (south). Average fall highs range from 60\u00b0F (north) to 70\u00b0F (south), while average lows range from 40\u00b0F (north) to 48\u00b0F (south). Northern Illinois averages 10 days at or above 90\u00b0F (north) compared to just over 40 days (south). Days at or above 100\u00b0F are quite rare, occurring about every other year (nort h) and 2 days annually (south). Illinois averages 140 days at or below 32\u00b0F (north) but only 80 such days (south). Days at or below 0\u00b0F range from 16 days annually (north) to 2 days (south). Average annual heating -degree days range from 70 days (north) t o 40 days (south). Average annual cooling- degree days range from 80 days (north) to 160 days (south). The base temperature used for both heating -degree and cooling -degree days is the same (65\u00b0F). The average length of the frost -free growing season in Ill inois ranges from 160 days (north) to more than 190 days (south). Average dates of the last occurrence of 32\u00b0F in spring range from April 28 (north) to April 7 (south), while the average dates of the first occurrence of this temperature in fall range from October 7 (north) to October 21 (south), and about October 14 near Lake Michigan, including the Chicago area, due to relatively warm waters of the lake. The highest and lowest temperatures ever reported in Illinois were 117\u00b0F in East St. Louis on July 14, 1954, and -36\u00b0F in Congerville on January 5, 1999. Precipitation Average precipitation exceeds 48 inches per year (south), compared to less than 32 inches (north). Snowfall distribution is just the opposite, with averages of 36 inches per year in the north to less than 10 inches in extreme southern Illinois. Winter snowfall is heaviest in the Chicago area, enhanced by lake - effect snows from Lake Michigan. Variability in precipitation also extends over time. There have been major multi -year droughts i n the 1930s and 1950s and major , prolonged wet periods during the 1970s and 1980s. May and June are typically the wettest months, and January and February are the driest. Each Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 2: Will County Community Overview Novembe r, 2013 Chapter 2 - 7 year, Illinois has rainstorms producing 40 or more flash -floods each with 4 to 8 inches of rainfall in a few hours in localized areas. The average number of days with measurable precipitation ranges from 110 days (north) to just under 100 days (south). The number of days with an inch or more of precipitation ranges from 8 days (n orth) to 13 days (south), and the number of days with an inch or more of snow ranges from 12 days (north) to 4 days (south). Days with 6 inches or more of snow are infrequent, ranging from once per year (north) to once in three years (south). Typical dat es of the first inch of snow range from November 20th (Chicago area) to December 20th (south). Typical dates of the last inch of snow range from March 26 (north) to March 5 (south). The average number of days with a measurable snow depth (1 inch or more) ranges from 60 days (northwest) to only 10 days (southwest). Precipitation records for Illinois include: Greatest 24 -hour rainfall was 16.94 inches at Aurora on July 17 -18, 1996 Greatest one -year precipitation was 74.58 inches at New Burnside in 1950 Greatest 24 -hour snowfall was 37.8 inches at Astoria on February 27- 28, 1900 Greatest winter snowfall was 105.1 inches at Antioch in 1978- 1979.

Peak months are April -June (63 percent of the total), but tornadoes have occurred in all months. Although Illinois averages four tornado -related fatalities per year, the number v aries widely from year to year. Thunderstorms account for 50 -60 percent of annual precipitation and are quite common in Il linois with an average of 60 storms (far northeast) to 80 storms (southwest). Nearly half of all thunderstorm days occur during the June -August period. Similarly, the average number of cloud -to-ground lightning strikes per square mile ranges from 5 strikes (northeast) to more than 11 strikes (southwest). Some thunderstorms produce hail, and annual average hail -days vary from 3.3 days (southwest) to less than 1.8 days (northeast). Climate and the Economy Major businesses in Illinois are highly climate se nsitive. Crop yields are dependent upon climate conditions because irrigation generally is not used. Illinois serves as the nation's center for air and surface transportation. With the nation's second busiest passenger airport (O'Hare) and the rail hub of the nation at Chicago, Illinois also is the heart of the nation's trucking industry. Each form of transportation is influenced by weather and climate extremes, and resulting delays in shipments are a major problem for manufacturers in Illinois. Vege tation Will County is located at the northeastern edge of the Tall Grass Prairie biome. The area was historically dominated by prairie and scattered woodlands, with wetlands associated with depressions and riverine systems. Much of the original vegetativ e communities of Will County are no longer present. The County is now made up primarily of agricultural land with various urban and suburban communities. Remnants of pre -settlement vegetation can still be found in the various Will County Forest Preserve District preserves and greenways, Illinois State Parks, and Illinois Nature Preserves located within the County. Rivers Three major river corridors are located within Will County; these corridors are associated with the DuPage River, the Kankakee River, and the Des Plaines River. Various creeks feed into the three main rivers, including Forked, Manhattan, Pike, Rock Run, Trim, Spring, Deer, Lily Cache, Grant, Thorn, Jackson, Prairie, Hickory, Sugar, and Plum Creeks. Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 2: Will County Community Overview Novemb er, 2013 Chapter 2 - 9 The DuPage River is 84 miles in length and travels through DuPage County and western Will County. The DuPage River is the largest tributary of the Des Plaines River and has two branches , the East Branch and the West Branch. The DuPage River enters Will County in Bolingbrook and travels south to Channahon where it joins the Des Plaines River and turns west, until they both join the Kankakee River to become the Illinois River. The Kankakee River enters Will County in t he southwestern section of the County. It traverses west through the south western -most portion of the C ounty. It eventually joins the Des Plaines River to form the Illinois River. The Des Plaines River flows southward from Wisconsin until it becomes adjacent to the Chicago Sanitary and Ships Canal in Lockport Township . It trav erses south adjacent to the Chicago Sanitary and S hips Canal a nd the I & M Canal, passes east of Romeoville , and turns southwest just south of Joliet . The Des Plaines River joins the Kankakee River just west of Joliet to form the Illinois River. The str eam corridors in Will County are important natural features and are protected by Will County's Stream and Wetland Protection Ordinance which prohibits development within 75 feet of streams. The Will County Land Resource Management Plan, Open Space Element states that \"streams and river systems are corridors of exceptional significance for resource protection and preservation of important natural habitats in the c ounty.\" Land Use Patterns Will County has a mixture of land uses that range from urban to rur al areas . Will County is the second fastest growing county in Illinois. Due to th is rapid growth, many changes are occurring within the C ounty. Some of these changes are seen as progress, others are seen as infringements on the quality of life residents have experienced for many years. Over the years, changes in land use have been decided by the more than thirty different authorities in charge of planning and land use regulation . On April 18, 2002, the County Board approved a new Land Resource Manageme nt Plan (LRMP ) With experts anticipating the population to increase by 60% by 2020 and the possibility of a new airport being built in . Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 2: Will County Community Overview Novembe r, 2013 Chapter 2 - 10 the southern portion of the County, community members have come to realize the importance of the development of a regiona l plan that coordinates the management of land use within the C ounty. The Will County Illinois Land Resource Management Plan provides the C ounty and local authorities with a framework for the form and shape of future growth. The idea of the plan is to id entify the C ounty as a leader on County- wide land use issues. It is also to assist local authorities with the site -specific issues of growth while supporting open space, farms, and environmentally sensitive land that has characterized Will County over the years.1 Currently, there are over 500,000 acres of land in Will County. Approximately 100,000 acres are developed for non- agricultural use. Almost 300,000 acres are used for agricultural purposes with the remaining 100,000 acres vacant. This provide s land beyond expected future demands. Urban areas are presently found in the northern half of the County. Joliet, the county seat, is the largest city in Will County. Other urban centers located in the northern townships are Plainfield, Lockport, New L enox, Mokena, and Frankfort along with Monee and Crete found in the most eastern townships. The City of Naperville and the Village of Bolingbrook are urban centers; however, their boundaries span both Will County and DuPage County. The cities are located near major transportation corridors (I -55, I -80, I -57, freight and commuter trains, regional buses, and waterways) allowing businesses and residents convenient access to shipping, work, shopping, and entertainment. Because of this convenience and availability of jobs in the Chicago Metropolitan area, all of these communities are now encountering rapid growth that is expected to continue into the coming decades. To preserve open space and agricultural land use, the C ounty's land use plan encourages future growth to be concentrated in existing urban areas. The plan recommends that development should occur in a logical and rational pattern to make effective use of existing infrastructure and avoid \"sprawl\" or \"leapfrog\" patterns. The rural areas are typifie d by agricultural uses, farm homesteads, and agricultural service businesses. Non-farm homes are generally built on larger lots without municipally oriented services such as water and 1 The Will County, Illinois Land Resource Management Plan, April 18, 2002. http://willcountylanduse.com/document/policy -gateway . Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 2: Will County Community Overview Novembe r, 2013 Chapter 2 - 11 sewer. Though there are farms scattered in between the cities and deve lopments in northern Will County, rural development predominates in the southern half of the County. The C ounty's land use plan indicates that the rural development and open space form is a pattern that is desirable and one that should be preserved. T he difficulty is to balance the demands for growth with the need to maintain agricultural viability and rural culture. Should the South Suburban Airport become a reality, the demand for growth in the southeast sector of the C ounty will be intensified. This new airport will help to alleviate the congestion at Chicago's two airports, but it will dramatically impact the area within the surrounding ten miles of the proposed new facility. Thus, the time is now for the C ounty and local authorities to work toge ther to prepare a plan that will meet the needs of the area while preserving the rural development form and property rights of farmers and agricultural businesses. In the mid 1990's, federal and state law created a special district to re -utilize land (24,000 acres) formerly occupied by the Joliet Army Ammunition Plant (JAAP). Four distinct land uses were created. The first is a new national cemetery (Lincoln National Cemetery), the second is the preservation of prairie (Midewin National Tall grass Prairie), another is a Will County landfill (Prairie View Recycling and Disposal Facility), and last are two industrial developments (Deer Run Industrial Park and the Island City Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 2: Will County Community Overview Novembe r, 2013 Chapter 2 - 12 Industrial Park). All four uses are endorsed by the Will County's land use plan. The development preserves open space while providing important economic development. Included in the industrial development is an intermodal facility that is expected to s hip between 1.7 and 4.6 million cargo containers and create 8,000 jobs . The recycling and disposal facility anticipates twenty to twenty -three years of operation that will accept 14 million tons of waste excluding the waste from the former arsenal site. This development suits the use of this land while utilizing existing infrastructure and respecting the natural landscape. Transportation Network As in the past, Will County's transportation infrastructure is essential to its economic well being and quality of life. Being close to Chicago has led Will County to develop an intricate and varied transportation system for the conveyance of raw materials, finished goods, workers, and tourists in and out of Chicago and its metropolitan area. It consists of roads, commuter and freight rail services, regional buses, waterways, and bikeways that transport goods and people. Because transpo rtation is so important to the County, the C ounty has adopted a 2030 Transportation Framework Plan. The concept of the plan stresses the relationship between land use policy and transportation facil ities and service. It identifies the strength and weaknesses of the current infrastructure, links transportation with land-use patterns, anticipates transportation needs for the coming decades, and provides recommendations for solving problems, meeting ne eds, and addressing transportation expans ion within the County. As the County experiences growth, particularly in the nor th and central sections of the C ounty, improvements in Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 2: Will County Community Overview Novembe r, 2013 Chapter 2 - 13 the current transportation infrastructure and new transportation routes will be necessary to accommodate the increase in population, businesses, and industries. There are three major travel corridors within Will County: first, a northeasterly flow to and from Chicago from th e northwestern sections of the C ounty; second, a north- south flow to and from Chicago from the centr al and eastern sections of the C ounty; and third, a north- south inter -suburban flow between Will and DuPage Counties that provide work commuting routes. Buildings The largest metropolitan area within Will County i s Joliet, the County seat. Joliet possesses both a government center and a rich cultural heritage. The central downtown area is home to both city and County government services; Joliet City Hall and the Will County Courthouse are located in the central downtown area. In addition to government services , Joliet is home to the Rialto Square Theatre, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is considered by many to be one of the most beautiful theaters in the United States. Also locat ed in Joliet, t he Jacob Henry Mansion is a historic landmark which is used for special events. Historic Sites Will County has many historic sites located within the County that have been preserved. Currently, Will County is home to 34 properties/structur es listed on the National Register of Histor ic Places, with an additional 19 sites identified as being eligible for listing. 2 2 http://www.nps.gov/nr Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 2: Will County Community Overview Novembe r, 2013 Chapter 2 - 14 Table 1: National Historic Register Properties within Will County3 Name Location Alternate Route 66, Wilmington to Joliet Illinois Route 53 between Wilmington & Joliet Brandon Road Lock & Dam Historic District 1100 Brandon Road Joliet Briscoe Mounds Front Street along the DesPlaines River Channahon Chicago Sanitary & Ship Canal Historic District Illinois Waterway miles 290.0 - 321.7 Christ Episcopal Church 75 W.

Interstates 55 and 80 intersect in Joliet, the c ounty seat, providing high accessibility. The state highways include IL 1, 7, 45, 50, 53, 59, and 394 along with U.S. Routes 6, 30, and 52. Fifty -six county highw ays exist to provide service between U.S. and state highways. Township roads serve the needs of the farming community and municipal streets serve local and through traffic within a city or village. The Will County 2030 Transportation Framework Plan identi fied the fact that substantial growth is forecasted for Will County, this growth will require transportation improvements. The plan makes specific suggestions for regional interstate, major roadway, arterial streets, and intersection realignments to accom modate this growth. 4 4 Barton -Aschman Associates, Will County 2030 Transportation Framework Plan, March 2009. http://willcountylanduse.com/resource/document/2009- transportation -plan Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 2: Will County Community Overview Novembe r, 2013 Chapter 2 - 20 Rail, Bus, and Non -motorized Transportation : Three commuter rail lines connect Will County to downtown Chicago: Metra Electric from University Park, Metra Heritage Corridor from Joliet through Lockport, and Metra Rock Island Distr ict from Joliet through New Lenox and Mokena. There is a need for Metra Commuter Rail improvements in the Heritage Corridor, Rock Island District, Southwest Service, Electric district, and Southeast Service lines to accommodate the growth that is forecasted for Will County.5 Freight rail is also important to the economy of Will County. As with road and commuter rail systems, freight rail systems lead in and out of the center of Chicago. Rail shipments from and to Illinois in 1994 measured over 120 billion tons and were comprised of coal, mixed freight, food products, farm products, and chemicals. In addition, Amtrak provides interstate passenger train travel. Bus service is provided through four types of transit service by the Pace System: traditional fixed route, limited express bus, dial - a-ride, and custom service. The C ounty region has very limited non -motorized transportation in the form of bikeways and pedestrian paths. Waterways : The Illinois water system provides additional economic value to Will County. The Des Plaines River and Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal cross through Will County connecting Chicago and the Great Lakes to the Illinois River that flows south to the Mississippi River and eventually leads into the Gulf of Mexico. In 1999, tonnage of commodities shipped to, from, and within the state totaled over 100 billion with a value of $16.5 billion. Goods shipped on the waterways consist of coal, petroleum, aggregates, grain, chemicals, ores, minerals, iron, and steel. This transpor tation system faces the problem of delays to commercial navigation traffic due to limited lockage capacity and increasing traffic. There are two navigation locks in Will County. Lock chambers throughout the state are over 70 years old and were built to a ccommodate 600- foot tows. Today's tows are typically 1,110 feet in length necessitating double lockages. Th us, their passage requires more time and money. Airports: A number of general avia tion airports exist within the C ounty: Joliet Park District, Lewis University, Howell Airport, Clow International Airport, and numerous small, privately held airports are 5 Barton -Aschman Associates, Will County 2030 Transportation Framework Plan, March 2009. http://willcountylanduse.com/resource/document/2009- transportation -plan Lockport Lock, Dam, & Powerhouse Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 2: Will County Community Overview Novembe r, 2013 Chapter 2 - 21 located within the C ounty. In addition to local airports, there is easy accessibility to Chicago's O'Hare International and Midway Airports. Pla ns are being debated for a South Suburban Airport which would be located in the C ounty's Peotone area and would demand additional infrastructure to support transportation needs and area growth that would inevitably result. Population Characteristics It is important to examine the population characteristics since densely populated areas typically experience the majority of destruction during a disaster. Further, grow ing communities offer opportunities to identify additional mitigation measures. Between 1 990 and 2010, Will County's population grew by over 320,000 people, nearly doubling its population in just twenty years . Approximately 8 5% of the County's population lives in the northern townships of Wheatland, DuPage, Plainfield, Lockport, Homer, Troy, Joliet, New Lenox, and Frankfort. Accordingly, it is also where the major urban areas are concentrated and the most growth is being experienced. The remaining townships, with the exception of Monee and Crete, are more rural in their characteristics. The age distribution throughout the C ounty population is 29% for under 18 years old , 61.6% for 18 to 64 years, and 9.32% for ages 65 years and older. Growth: Census statistics show that Will County is the second fastest growing County in the State of Illinois. The County increased in population from just over 350,000 in 1990 t o over 677,000 in 20 10. In 2012, estimates place d the County's population at 682,518. Estimated population totals for Will County will reach 1, 215,818 by 2030. The townships that m ay expect to see significant growth by 203 0 are DuPage, Frankfort, Homer, Monee, New Lenox, Plainfield, Troy, and Wheatland. Rapid employment growth will be seen in DuPage, Troy, Frankfort, Monee, and Crete Townships. Should the proposed South Suburban A irport be built, higher growth in population and employment will occur in Monee, Crete, Peotone, Will, and possibly Green Garden and Washington townships. Gender, Age, and Race: The population of the County is almost equally divided between male and femal e. The median age i s 33 years for the C ounty, but a median between three to eight years higher is seen in th e more rural townships. County- wide, the population is predominantly white, 82%, with more diverse populations found in the townships of Wheatland , DuPage, Lockport, Troy, Joliet, Monee, Crete, and Wesley. or African Americans represent 11% of the C ounty population and Hispanics or Latinos total 15%. Language: English is the predominant language spoken at home throughout the C ounty (88% of the population five years and over ). Spanish ( 7%), Indo-European (3.2% ), and Asian and Pacific Island Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 2: Will County Community Overview Novembe r, 2013 Chapter 2 - 22 (1.4% ) were the other predominant languages spoken at home. Those who speak English less than \"very well\" represent 4.6% of the County population five years and over. Individual townships have fairly similar statistics with the exception being Joliet, Will, and rural townships. In Joliet Township, English only is spoken at home in 80.3% of the population five years and over. The rural townships tend to have an English only rate of approximately 95% with Spanish and Indo -European being evenly split with a rate of approximately 2% each. These townships also have a lower rate, roughly 1%, of the population that does not speak English well. Special Needs: Based on the 2000 census, t here are approximately 57,900 people disabled within the County's population. Of the people ages five to twenty years, 5.8% (1.5% of the total County population) are disabled. The population of twenty -one to sixty- four years of age has a 12.3% disabled rate (7% of the total County population). Last, 38.4% (3% of the total County population) of the County's people sixty -five and older are disabled. This pattern of distribution is consistent throughout most of the townships. Lower rates of disability are seen in Wheatland Township's population of five to twenty years (3.9%) and New Lenox and Frankfort Townships' sixty- five years and over population (31.8%, 30.2% respectively). Joliet Township has a higher rate of disability (21.8%) in its twenty -one to sixty -four years population. Economics can also impact the ability to respond during a disaster. Poorer residents may not have the resources to stockpile supplies for a disaster or evacuate following a disaster. In 2003, 6% of W ill County residents were living in poverty. Five percent of all families and 17% of families whose head of household was female had income levels below the poverty level (U.S. Census, 2003 estimate). Economic Characteristics : Again, location is essential to Will County's economic success. Will County is proximate to Chicago, one of the nation's major cities . O'Hare and Midway Airports, four interstate highways, railways, and waterways provide access for goods, services, and workers to move in and out of Chicago. In addition, there are over ninety business parks with available space for businesses, low real estate property taxes, and many varied choices in housing. Will County has a labor force of over 250,000 people that includes skilled labor. Of the people age twenty -five years and older, 90.2% are high school graduates and 31.3% have bachelor degrees or higher. Add to that, the County's central location in a metropolitan area allows businesses to draw from a six -county labor force of 4.3 million pe ople. Range of Entities : Business entities encompass manufacturing, retail, professional service, education services, health care, real estate, and a growing entertainment industry. Major employers include Presence Saint Joseph Medical Center, Harrah's Jo liet Casino and Empress Casino Joliet Corp., Will Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 2: Will County Community Overview Novembe r, 2013 Chapter 2 - 23 County Government, Caterpillar, Inc., Federal Signal Corporation, Joliet Public School District #86 and Joliet Junior College District ComEd and Exelon Company, T.J. Lambrecht Construction, and CITGO Petroleum Corporation. Manufacturing sales in 1997 were over $7.5 billion with chemical, machinery, and computer and electronic product manufacturing predominating. Wholesale trade produced almost $4 billion in sales composed of durable goods such as mot or vehicle and motor vehicle parts, lumber, metal service centers, machinery and equipment. Wholesale non -durable goods include grains, plastic materials, petroleum products and bulk stations, and beer. Total retail sales in 2001 were approximately $4.3 billion. Retail trade sales reached over $3 billion with motor vehicle and parts dealers, building material dealers, food and beverage stores, gasoline stations, health and personal care stores, and general merchandise stores prevalent. Professional servi ces produced over $285 million in receipts in the form of architectural and engineeri ng, legal, accounting, computer systems, management consulting, scientific and technical services. Healthcare produced almost $400 million in receipts and education recei pts reached almost $10 million. The entertainment industry receipts for 1997 were over $385 million. Performing arts, gambling boats, recreation sports, ballpark, and racetracks are a rapidly growing industry attracting large numbers of people to the C ounty as workers and spectators. With almost 300,000 acres of farm land in Will County, there are just over 500 full time farms averaging 323 acres. The County's climate and soil support a variety of agricultural commodities such as grains, hay, fruits, veg etables, cattle , swine, sheep, and poultry. Market value of agricultural products sold is over $107 million consisting of crop sales (92%) and livestock sales (8%). Similar to Illinois' total production, corn (17 million bushels) and soybeans (4.6 million bushels) are the primary crops produced and swine (42,557 sold) the main livestock sold. The County's transportation system allows easy shipment of crops and livestock for processing and export. Earnings: Per capita , personal income in 2000 was $26,664 and ranked 20 th in the state, representing 84% of the state's average of $31,856. Median household money income was just over $62,000. Earnings by persons employed in W ill County increased from $5.6 billion in 1999 to over $6 b illion in 2000 with the la rgest industry being services, 23.6% of earnings; state and local government, 14.7%; and construction, 14.0%. There are over 175,000 housing units with a median value of $154,300 of which 83.1% are owner occupied. The unemployment rate as of 2001 was 5.4% and approximately 4.9% of the County's population lives below the poverty level. Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 2: Will County Community Overview Novembe r, 2013 Chapter 2 - 24 Taxes: Various tax structures are applied to business, personal income, and property within Will County. Federal and state income taxes are applied to personal and corpora te income, but no local personal or corporate income tax es exists. A state sales tax of 6.25% is applied to tangible personal property with local sales tax rates varying from 0 to 2.5%. The state imposes a utility tax on electricity and natural gas suppl ies, and some local governments also collect a utility tax. Local governments are authorized to collect property taxes on real property that is assessed at 33.4% of market value. The typical tax rate per $100 of assessed value is $6.62. Incentives: Alon g with the application of federal, state, and local taxes, a number of tax incentives are applied to promote development and expansion of businesses and rejuvenate economically distressed areas. As an example, Joliet, Lockport, and Rockdale are part of th e DesPlaines River Valley Enterprise Zone that provides ten -year property tax abatement and other tax incentives on all real improvements that increase the assessed valuation of property. Other forms of incentives to encourage business development, expans ion, modernization, and competitive improvement include participation loan programs, industrial training programs, industrial revenue bonds, environmental bonds, venture funds, tax increment financing (TIF), block grants, and various Small Business Adminis tration (SBA) assistance programs. These assistance programs are provided by federal, state, and local sources. Growth Resources: Encouraging growth, a number of organizations provide business development resources to expand the economy within the C ounty. To name a few, Will County Center for Economic Development provides information and assistance in locating or expanding businesses in Will County. The Illinois Department of Commerce & Community Affairs is the state's economic development agency that p rovides programs and services designed to help Illinois businesses thrive in the global economy. The Will Economic Network is a county- wide consortium which ensures the highest level of cooperation between the public and private sectors assisting business es to locate, grow, and prosper in Will -. The Joliet Arsenal Development Authority oversees the redevelopment of the former Joliet Army Ammunition Plant property. City Center Partnership also provides programs and incentives to help new and expanding businesses. Another business development resource is the Three Rivers Manufacturer's Association that serves the needs of local manufacturers in Will and Grundy counties. The assistance and resources that organizations like these provide make the area attra ctive to businesses looking to develop or expand. Future: What the economic future holds for Will County can only be estimated. The Chicago metropolitan area continues to grow outward into the surrounding counties. Of these collar counties, Will County is expected to be the fastest growing. It is forecasted that the area as a whole will grow by 25% while Will County is expected to grow over 60% within the next twenty years. This means that Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 2: Will County Community Overview Novembe r, 2013 Chapter 2 - 25 potentially 180 square miles of new land could be developed ove r this time frame. Most of this land would be used for residential purposes with some used for business and industrial use. The building of the South Suburban Airport is a factor that will have the greatest effect on the C ounty's growth. If it is built, there will be a large demand for services, infrastructure, workers, housing, schools, etc. to support its function. This additional source for transportation of goods and people will increase the rate of business development. This means there will be more people and property to protect from hazards, more technology and businesses that may present a hazard, and more people and businesses that could attract or be affected by societal hazards. Assessing the risks, planning, mitigating hazards, and prepa ring for emergencies will remain essential activities to ensure the safety of Will County's residents. Essential Government Services There are many community service organizations needed to effectively carry out the emergency management plan in the event o f an occurrence. Local law enforcement, fire departments, and emergency medical services (EMS) are called first when an emergency occurs. Hospitals care for the sick and injured. Law Enforcement : Law enforcement's role is to safeguard lives and propert y, enforce the law, and maintain order. Within Will County, there is a County sheriff's office, thirty -four municipal police departments, four special district police departments, four railroad police departments, and two university police departments. T he Illinois State Police also maintains a station north of Joliet. Fire Protection and Emergency Medical Service: Municipal fire departments and local fire districts safeguard lives and protect property by containing fires and responding to accidents or other emergencies. The larger communities in Will County have full -time fire department staffs. The smaller communities Twenty Year Household Forecasts 2000 -2020 Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 2: Will County Community Overview Novembe r, 2013 Chapter 2 - 26 have volunteer staffs that respond when an emergency occurs. There are also several special fire departments maintained by the major oil and chemical companies. EMS is responsible for immediate medical attention. There are over twenty local EMS units within the County and several private or corporate EMS units serving the community. For care beyond first aid, Will County has two hosp itals, Presence Saint Joseph Medical Center and Silver Cross Hospital and Medical Center located in Joliet. The Will County Health Department is another agency providing important services to the public , not only in the event of an emergency , but also eve ryday. They provide comprehensive public health programs and primary health care and dental service for medically underserved residents. More than 300 agency professionals work to prevent disease and promote a healthy environment for the growing County's residents. T hroughout an emergency , public health consequences are evaluated, findings are reviewed, and affected people are debriefed. The department provides epidemiological follow -up of a population suffering a known, clearly defined health effect in association with a clear -cut cause. Public health also supports the provision of health care, evacuation of patients, hospital care coordination, public health information, victim identification, and mortuary services. Emergencies may include, among oth ers, hazardous chemicals, contaminated food or water, infectious/communicable disease, floods, tornadoes, or radiation exposure. Schools : Will County currently has 29 school districts under the jurisdiction of the Will County Regional Office of Education. This office oversees 19 elementary districts, three high school districts, and seven unit districts. 6 Elementary School Districts located in Will County include Beecher, Lenox, Peotone, Plainfield, Richland, Additionally, there are other school districts located within the County that may come under other jurisdictions because their district boundaries are o f a multi- county nature. High School Districts located within Will County include Beecher, Channahon, Crete Monee, Joliet Township, Lincoln Way, Lockport Plainfield, Reed Cluster (Braidwood), Valley View (Romeoville and Bolingbrook), and Wilmington. 6 http://www.willroe.org/index.php/schools -districts/school-directory Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 2: Will County Community Overview Novembe r, 2013 Chapter 2 - 27 Rockdale, Summit Hill, Taft (Lockport), Troy, Union, University Park, Valley View, Will County, and Wilmington. A map of the s chool district boundaries within Will County can be found at: http://www.willroe.org/index.php/schools -districts/school -district -maps . Non-Essential Government Services Will County has a ri ch and diversified offering of publicly owned recreational facilities located throughout the County. There are also several Illinois state parks located in the County. Channahon State Park is the official trailhead for the I&M Canal State Trail. The I&M Canal State Trail is made up of 61 miles of multi- purpose trail tha t ends at LaSalle/Peru. The Des Plaines Fish and Wildlife Area in Wilmington offers fishing and hunting opportunities, as well as an 80 -acre nature preserve. Additionally, the State of I llinois recognizes 17 dedicated nature preserves in Will County. A dedicated nature preserve is designed to preserve the natural features of the land ; nature preserves do not necessarily allow public access but most do. Only high quality natural areas qu alify for this designation. There are two federally -owned parks located within Will County. The I & M Canal National Heritage Canal is operated by the National Park Service and serves to maintain the historic and cultural heritage associated with what w as originally a 97 -mile canal from the Chicago River to the Illinois River. Today, the Park Service offers a variety of recreational and interpretive services for visitors. The U.S. Forest Service operates the first tallgrass prairie in the United States , Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie . Established in 1996, this 15,454- acre property once belonged to the Joliet Army Ammunition Plant. Today, it is being restored to tallgrass prairie and is dedicated to conserving, restoring, and enhancing natural habitat.

Maps of these trails can be found at http://www.reconnectwithnature.org/preserves -trails and include the Old Plank Road Trail, I & M Canal Trail, Hickory Creek Bikeways, Rock Run Trail, Lake Renwick Bikeway, and the Waubonsee Glacial Trail. A number of municipal recreation departments and independent park districts operate throughout Will Count y. These park districts offer a variety of services, including recreational opportunities, fitness classes, and enrichment classes. Recreation departments and park districts are operated in and near the communities of Bolingbrook, Channahon, Crete, Elwood, Frankfort, Romeoville, and Sh orewood . There is one privately owned facility that was developed for public use in Will County that deserves to be mentioned. The Chi cagoland Speedway and Route 66 Raceway make up the Joliet Motor Sports Complex, the largest sporting facility in Illinois. Th is facility is a multi-purpose motor sports complex that provide s for a variety racing types, including NASCAR. 8 Nuclear Power: Nuclear power is an important source for generating electricity and accounts for 49.6% of Illinois' electricity source. Braidwood Nuclear Power Station is a two-unit nuclear generating facility , located within Will County, twenty -two miles southwest of Joliet. Dresden Nuclear Generating Statio n is located in Grundy County outside of Morris, but its ten- mile emergency planning zone includes part of the southwest area of Will County. It is reported t o be a world -class racing facility. Utilities Utilities provide power needed by homes and businesses to operate. Commonwealth Edison (ComEd) is one of the nation's largest electric utilities with $15 billion in revenues and five million people as a customer base. Their Community and Economic Development Team work with businesses to provide in - depth site selection information, critical utility analysis, and access to Illinois business resources. A benefit of nuclear power are clean air , as no harmful gases are emitted into the environment by the process. The concern, of course, is radiation exposure that may occur either as a result of an accident or 8 http://www.chicagolandspeedway.com/?homepage=true Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 2: Will County Community Overview Novembe r, 2013 Chapter 2 - 31 sabotage. Thus, careful security measures and emergency management planning for these facilities are necessary to ensure the safety of the public. Natural Gas : Nicor Gas, also one of the largest providers in its industry with a customer base of 2 million, has provided natural gas service in northern Illinois for over 45 years. Their service area covers roughly 17,000 square miles and supports more than 29,500 miles of gas main. Nicor has connection s to seven interstate pipelines , is accessible to all major gas producing areas in the C ounty, and has an extensive system of underground gas storage. Flexible rates, options to choose alternate commodity supplier s, a competitively priced gas commodi ty, and reliable delivery allow customers to depend on Nicor Gas. Telecommunications : SBC is a global company providing telecommunications service s that include local and long distance telephone, cellular, paging, and internet capabilities. SBC serves a thirteen state region and has invested over $4 billion in infrastructure throughout Illinois over the last four years. They connect over 2 billion local telephone calls and handle 4.5 million installations a year. Community Vulnerability The activities and businesses that attract people to live and work in Will County and bring economic stability to the area also present hazards that put the population at risk. Relating to the concerns that arise from the use of utilities, hazards exist from the operation of the many chemical companies located in the C ounty. Petroleum refineries and product manufacturing, paper, soap and cleaning compounds, and plastics and rubber manufacturing all utilize or produce materials that pos e fire, toxin, or explosion risks that can injure people and damage property and the environment. These hazardous occurrences can occur on site or while the materials or products are being transported by truck, rail, or boat. To balance the economic bene fit to the C ounty with the hazards of chemical production, adequate safety measures must be in place to protect workers and the surrounding population. On a daily basis, the primary purpose of school facilities is education. Thirty -three public school dis tricts operate within Will County, in addition to a number of private schools, educating students who attend kindergarten through twelfth grade. One junior college and three four -year colleges operat e within the boundaries of the C ounty. These facilities serve the important daily function of education, but they can also act as a resource for emergency management by utilizing the school facilities for community centers in the event of an occurrence. Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 2: Will County Community Overview Novembe r, 2013 Chapter 2 - 32 Community centers may be needed to accommodate the population displaced by evacuation, to act as a medical center, or to house emergency personnel coming to assist from outside the County. These facilities can also be the target of the many hazards facing the County. Because of the number of students and fa culty concentrated within a facility, emergency management must be prepared to handle high numbers of injuries or deaths should the facility be damaged during an occurrence. Tornadoes, fires, heating equipment explosions, food poisoning, bomb threats, or terrorist type attacks are all potential disasters that must be prepared for through emergency management. A growing aspect of the County's economy is the entertainment industry. Historic sites, theaters, park district facilities, hunting, fishing, boatin g, and golf are many of the leisure activities enjoyed by residents of Will County. New to the C ounty are casino boats, motor sports complexes, and a baseball park which attract local community members and people from the surrounding Chicago metropolitan area. Economically these entertainment centers bring added revenue from ticket sales, restaurants, and hotel services. But like the schools, there are security issues that must be add ressed to protect the hundreds or thousands of people attending events from the effects of natural, technological, and societal hazards. Preparations must be in place to effectively manage any emergencies that may occur. Profile Summary Understanding the geography, activities, population characteristics, economy, and communi ty services is important to identifying the hazards facing a community, perceiving the effects hazards will have on people and property, determining the vulnerability of the population, and surmising the probability that an eemrgency will occur. This information base provides the backdrop for assessing the hazards that should be addressed for the protection and well being of the community. The preparation of the hazard analysis is part science but also part art. Facts are combined with experience, perceptions, priorities, and culture to identify and develop a ranking of the hazards to be used for emergency planning. Keep in mind that community characteristics continually change and a key element of Will County's future is growth. Thus, the hazard analysis is not a static process. As changes occur , the hazard analysis will need to be re -evaluated and modified to address the changing needs of the County. Significant Future Development Plans Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 2: Will County Community Overview Novembe r, 2013 Chapter 2 - 33 It is important for the Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitig ation Plan to be incorporated into other County plans. The following is a discussion of Will County's development initiatives. Hazard mitigation should be incorporated wherever feasible. Land Resource Management Plan The Will County Land Resource Managem ent Plan was developed to establish a framework which allows local communities to work with regional entities in order to allow for carefully planned land development and management during Will County's projected growth. The following priority issues were identified in the plan: Regional coordination among various government entities, The need for regional open- space and agricultural protection, The need for environmental protection, The quality and timing of new development, Automotive transportation ne eds, Promoting a compact (non -sprawled) form of development, Housing density and variety, and Non-automotive transportation needs. The Land Resource Management Plan identifies goals and strategies to fulfill the priority issues identified. Additionally, the plan provides use concepts that provide guidance to local communities on how to manage land use by such categories as development, open space, transportation, historic preservation, and stormwater management. A Forms & Concepts Handbook accompanies the Land Resource Management Plan, in which regional development forms should be promoted. Development use concepts are provided to guide local communities i n assessing specific development proposals to see if they fit with the community's land use form. Spe cific development forms discussed in this handbook are: Rural areas Hamlets Towns Urban communities Suburban communities Interstate access locations Former Joliet Army Ammunition Plant area, and Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 2: Will County Community Overview Novembe r, 2013 Chapter 2 - 34 South Suburban Airport. Specific development use concepts des igned to protect the chosen development form are provided in the handbook. These development use concepts include: Agriculture, Conservation design, Conventional residential suburban, Traditional residential, Multi- family complex, Employment campuses, Regional commercial, Mid-scale commercial, Neighborhood commercial, Free standing industry and office, and Projects of regional impact. An Open Space Element handbook also accompanies the Land Resource Management Plan. This handbook promotes initiatives for m anaging development in high priority areas to create greenway corridors as well as create large preserves for the protection of biodiversity. This handbook also provides criteria for identifying land for inclusion in the open space system. Will County 20 30 Transportation Framework Plan The Will County 20 30 Transportation Framework Plan is the outcome of a collaborative effort among municipalities, townships, and regional agencies. The plan was written to guide transportation improvements through the year 2030 for all modes of transportation, including roads, public transportation, railroads, bikeways, pedestrian, equestrian, and airport transportation. The Transportation Framework Plan identified the fact that substantial growth is forecasted for Will Coun ty; this growth will require transportation Lockport, New Lenox, Frankfort, Plainfield, Monee, and Crete were identified as the townships predicted to experience the greatest amount of growth and in need of the gre atest amount of transportation improvements. Will Township will also experience significant increases in transportation needs if the South Suburban Airport is built. Continued growth in the east, southwest, northwest and west central areas will require i mproved Metra commuter train service. Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 2: Will County Community Overview Novembe r, 2013 Chapter 2 - 35 The Transportation Framework Plan makes specific suggestions for roadway improvements, including major roadways, arterial streets, and intersection realignments. Additionally, specific recommendations are made for reg ional arterial improvements, corridor studies, Metra commuter rail improvements, and Pace bus system improvements. Will County Stormwater Management Plan The Will County Stormwater Management Plan represents a coordinated effort on the part of Will County and its municipalities to manage issues as they pertain to floodplain and stormwater management. Planning activities are coordinated through the Will County Stormwater Management Planning Committee. The Committee focuses on existing stormwater management programs as well as issues related to future development. A major focus area is the adoption of a county- wide stormwater ordinance to ensure consistency of approach and to coordinate stormwater issues that extend beyond political boundaries. The reducti on of risk brought about by flooding is an important goal of the Stormwater Management Plan and the Stormwater Management Planning Committee. Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 3: All Hazard Risk Assessment Summary November, 2013 Chapter 3 - 1 CHAPTER 3: ALL HAZARD RISK ASSESSMENT SUMM ARY Will County EMA has been proactive in identifying risks. In 2003 and 2004 , Will County EMA first published several hazard and vulnerability assessments including the Will County Hazard Analysis , Will County Terrorism Vulnerability Assessment (not for Public Distribution) and the Will County Terrorism Vulnerability Assessment of Critical Infrastructure Results (not for Public Distribution). Will County EMA recognizes that the assessment and anal ysis of vulnerability to the County is a definitive measure of the risk associated with each individual hazard. In order to effectively and efficiently integrate existing documents and operations, the updated 2013 Will County Hazard Analysis has been incorporated into the Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan. This allow s Will County to identify mitigation objective s, strategies, and actions that address all of Will County's risks. The Will County Terrorism Vulnerability Assessment and the Terrorism Vulnerability Assessment of Critical Infrastructure Results were not incorporated into this document due to the sensitive information that is contained in these reports. Will County developed a hazard risk assessment in 2003. This document was updated in 2008, as part of the All -Hazard Mitigation Plan. Using this assessment as a baseline document and incorporating new data that encompasses the years 2008- 2013, the Will County planning team updated and re -developed a comprehensive all -hazard ris k assessment that thoroughly analyzed the County's natural, technological, and societal hazard risks. The planning team re -evaluated and updated the following elements in the previously developed risk assessment: hazard identification, inventory of commun ity assets vulnerable to the hazards, hazard events profile, magnitude, history, probability, impacts, flood insurance claims, repetitive losses, and future development trends. The committee decided to utilize the rating system identified in the original 2008 plan. The 2013 Will County Hazard Analysis utilize s a formal, structured procedure to develop mitigation and emergency operation plans. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has developed a process for assessing and evaluati ng hazards. Wi ll County ch ose this process in order to reduce inconsistencies an d promote a common bas e for completing the analysis by defining criteria and providing a scoring system . Four criteria were used to describe a nd assess the potential hazards; the four criteria include: Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 3: All Hazard Risk Assessment Summary November, 2013 Chapter 3 - 2 History - past record of occurrences of the specified hazard. It is a guide of what has occurred in the past but is not a guarantee of what may occur in the future. Vulnerability - pertains to the people that might be killed, injured, or cont aminated and to property that might be destroyed, damaged, or contaminated due to the occurrences of a specified hazard. Maximum Threat - consists of the impacts from a 'worst case' scenario of a specified hazard and is where the greatest impact to people and property is expected and assessed. Probability - refers to the likelihood of the occurrence of a specified hazard. It is expressed as the number of chances per year that an event of a specific intensity will occur. Each of the four criteria is given a weighting factor as on e criterion can be judged to be more important than another: History 2 points Vulnerability 5 points Maximum Threat 10 points Probability 7 points Each of the four criteria were evaluated and given a description of the li kelihood or impact of the event. The descriptive terms used were low, medium, and high. Each of the three descriptive t erms is given a numerical value: Low 1 point Medium 5 points High 10 points The composite score for each hazard is calculated by multiplying the descriptive numerical value assigned to each weighted criterion score. Each weighted score is summed to determine the hazards composite score . The following is a list of the natural, technological, and societal hazards investigated , while a summary of the 2013 Will County Hazard Analysis is shown on the following pages.

The risk to Will County was determined by the history and probability of the hazard in relation to the hazard's vulnerability and maximum threat. Hazard Loss Modeling To supplement the impact analysis and risk determination, a hazard loss model and analysis was performed for select scenarios for natural, technological, and societal hazards . The scenarios selected were based on historical occurrences of disasters, availability of data, and the severity of the hazard risk. The hazard loss analys is process utilized Hazards U.S. - Multi- hazard ( HAZUS -MH) modeling, GIS analysis, and available historical disaster data and information to conduct quantitative analysis to estimate the loss due to the selected natural, technological and societal hazard e vents. HAZUS -MH is a powerful risk assessment software program for analyzing potential losses from floods, hurricane winds and earthquakes. In HAZUS -MH, current scientific and engineering knowledge is coupled with the latest Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 3: All Hazard Risk Assessment Summary November, 2013 Chapter 3 - 11 Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology to produce estimates of hazard related damage before, or after, a disaster occurs. The analysis reports obtained from the HAZUS -MH model includes the following: Estimation of the losses to structures and contents Estimation of the losses to structure use and function Projection of human losses Estimation of the primary direct and indirect loss The HAZUS -MH and GIS analysis was used to determine which individual assets were vulnerable to the largest potential losses; by adding the structure loss, content loss, and function loss for each asset to determine the total loss. This process produced the following: Calculation of the losses to each asset Calculation of the estimated damages for each hazard event Creation of a map that shows a compo site of the areas of highest loss Many of the human- induced hazards provide some unique implications for loss estimation because these events can take place with different magnitudes, in any location, at any time, and under various circumstances. Because the characteristics of many of the human- induced events are not definitive, a generalized loss analysis was conducted. The following scenarios were assessed and analyzed utilizing GIS data and HAZUS -MH modeling. Overbank Flooding Event of Will County Stre am and River Reaches . A F4 Plainfield Tornado. A 5.3 magnitude earthquake in DuPage County. This was the largest historical earthquake in the Chicago area. A hazardous materials release from a large industrial facility . A hazardous materials release from a transportation incident . A terrorist bombing with a similar magnitude of that of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. The Hazard Loss Modeling findings and reports are provided in Appendix B. Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 3: All Hazard Risk Assessment Summary November, 2013 Chapter 3 - 12 Scenario Summaries Overbank Flooding Event of Will County Stream and River Reaches The FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) indicate that a large area of Will County's built environment is within the Base Flood Elevation. The Base Flood Elevation (BFE) is defined as the area that has a 1% chance of flooding in any give n year. HAZUS -MH Flood Risk Module would be utilized for modeling riverine flooding of Will County's stream and river network. F4 Plainfield Tornado GIS Analysis was utilized to determine the impacts of the 1990 Plainfield Illinois F4 tornado that skipp ed through Will County during mid afternoon. Although the track of this tornado was identified, detail ed information on the area damaged could not be determined. Will County GIS data was utilized to determine structures identified within the damage areas . The potential loss of a F4 tornado traveling a similar path as the 1990 F4 tornado was projected based on today's built environment and in today's economy. 5.1 Magnitude Earthquake in DuPage County, Illinois This was the largest historical earthquake in the Chicago area. HAZUS -MH Earthquake Risk Module provides estimates of damage and loss to buildings, essential facilities, transportation and utility lifelines, and population based on scenario or probabilistic earthquakes. In addition, the Earthquak e Risk Module estimates the debris generated, fire, casualties, and shelter requirements following the disaster. Based on consultation with the Illinois State Geologic Survey, the May 26, 1909 earthquake that occurred near Aurora, Illinois is the best sce nario to model with the limitations on available data. Although this earthquake was a 5.1 -magnitude, limitations of the HAZUS -MH model does not provide accurate information for those earthquakes less than a magnitude 5.5. Therefore, this earthquake analy sis assumes that this historical earthquake had a magnitude of 5.5. Due to information constraints on soil types, the analysis of a larger earthquake generated from the New Madrid Fault could not be conducted. Hazardous Materials Release : Fixed Facility The U.S. EPA's ALOHA (Ar eal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres) model was utilized to assess the area of impact for a chlorine release at a large industrial facility located southwest of Joliet near Arsenal Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 3: All Hazard Risk Assessment Summary November, 2013 Chapter 3 - 13 Road and Interstate 55. Chlorine is a common chemical that is used in industrial operations and can be found in either liquid or gas form. For this scenario, moderate atmospheric and climatic conditions with a slight breeze from the west were assumed. The target area of Arsenal Road and I -55, \"Joliet Arsenal Hub\", was chosen due to its large industrial facilities, rail and truck hubs, and the presence of a large number of large quantity hazardous material generators. Hazardous Materials Release: Transportation Incident The U.S. EPA's ALOHA (Ar eal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres) model was utilized to assess a chlorine release from a barge at a large transportation hub southwest of Joliet at US Route 6, Interstate 55, and the Des Plaines River. Rail, truck tankers, and barges commonly haul chlo rine, as well as other hazardous materials, to and from facilities. For this scenario, moderate atmospheric and climatic conditions with a slight breeze from the west were assumed. The target area of the US Route 6, I -55, and Des Plaines River was chosen due to its heavy barge traffic, large rail and truck hubs, as well as the presence of a large number of large quantity hazardous material generators. Terrorist Bombing GIS Analysis was utilized to determine the impacts of a bombing near a critical infras tructure of Will County with a similar magnitude of the April 19, 1995 Oklahoma City Bombing. In the Oklahoma City Bombing, a Ryder rental truck was loaded with approximately 5,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate fertilizer and detonated outside of the Murrah Federal Building. The explosion generated a pressure blast of 50 0,000 psi, destroyed one -third of the Murrah Federal Building, and created a crater thirty feet wide and eight feet deep. The Will County target analyzed in this hazard modeling is the Will County Court House . Limitations The analysis of hazards is complicated by a number of factors including laws, customs, ethics, values, attitudes, political preferences, and complex infrastructures and built environment. A hazard analysis provide s a weal th of valuable information that is essential for identifying goals, prioritizing actions, planning and preparedness, and recovering and mitigating future hazards. The assessment of data and identifying the risk to a community is not a hard science . It is difficult to predict hazard impacts , and conclusions are not absolute. The perception of what constitutes a risk and a Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 3: All Hazard Risk Assessment Summary November, 2013 Chapter 3 - 14 judgment of its impact can differ from individual to individual. The changing natural, built, or societal environments can have a significant affect on each hazard assessment. A hazard risk assessment does provide a guide to evaluate Will County's risks and guide s the Will County E MA to perform t heir mission of protecting the C ounty. For this reason, it is important to periodically up date and improve the County's Risk Assessment with best available data. Regional All Hazards Risk Assessment Project FEMA provides funds to the Illinois -Indiana -Wisconsin (IL -IN-WI) Combined Statistical Area (CSA) under the Regional Catastrophic Preparedness Grant Program (RCPGP). The purpose of the RCPGP is to support preparedness efforts of local jurisdictions, spanning multiple states, in planning for catastrophic events or disasters. An initiative under the RCPGP was the Regional All Hazards Risk As sessment Project. Will County Emergency Management Agency was a member of this subcommittee whose mission was to plan for and mitigate catastrophic and routine incidents. The project completed in July, 2013, provided Will County with two analysis tracks. The first was an assessment of the capabilities of the County to implement the 31 Core Capabilities described in the National Preparedness Goal. The other was software called System -wide Multi -hazard Risk Tool (SMRT) utilized to conduct risk analysis. SMRT was used for the regional assessment of chosen hazards: tornados, extreme heat, pandemic, blackout, and terrorism. The Core Capability assessment and SMRT software tool will enhance the County 's ability to analyze risk and improve planning to addre ss the hazards faced by the County. The SMRT software will be used to re-evaluate the hazard analysis in an effort to obtain consistent and objective data. The Core Capability assessment establishes a baseline for preparedness from which training and res ource needs can be identified and improved. Along with the regional risk assessment completed under the project, the data generated from these tools will help to develop a county- wide Threat and Hazard Identification Risk Assessment (THIRA) which will lea d to improved mitigation planning. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 1 CHAPTER 4: HAZARD PROFILES AND VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT The following profiles include not only natural hazards but also technological and societal hazards that have the potential to affect Will County. The location of Will County is a factor in ma ny of the hazards that face the County. Being located in the Midwest, the County is subject to extreme changes in climate. During the s pring through fall seasons , the County experiences many thunderstorms. These storms can be quite severe and bring with them the damaging effects of wind, lightning, hail, and flood. Will County is also located in the section of the United States that experiences the most tornado activity. The worst tornado to hit the County occurred in 1990. The summer months can also bring high temperatures which may lead to periods of drought and its damaging effect on crops and water supply . As the season s change to winter, the temperature can change to extreme cold and along with this cold often comes snow, ice, more wind, and more flooding. These winter storms can knock down the power supply and bring travel routes to a close. The location of Will County is also the reason for many of the technological and societal hazards that the County may experience. Being proximate to Chicago, Will County is the hub for many transportation systems that lead into the Chicago area. Interstate highways, railways, bus routes, waterways, pipelines, and airports are systems that transport raw materials, finished products, and people in and out of the County. T hese transportation systems encourage the development of business enterprises which bring in materials to produce products utilized throughout the country and the world. Along with these transportation systems and entities of commerce come risks. Some of the chemicals used in manufacturing and agriculture have hazardous effects on people and the environment. As these chemicals are transported or processed, there is the potential for spills, fire, explosion, and harmful contamination. Nucl ear power plants utilize fuel that can have damaging effects for generations should it be released during transportation or a plant accident. Though technological advances have helped to make Will County prosperous, the potential for harm must be addresse d through programs of preparedness. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 2 Again, the location of Will County plays a part in societal hazards. The ease of transportation, the growing job market, and the mix of urban and rural lifestyles attract people to work and live in Will County. The s pread of the Chicago metropolitan area also has an effect on th e County's society as it spills into Will C ounty. As more people come to live in Will County, urban areas develop bringing in more business, manufacturing, retail shopping , and entertainment venues. Growth in urban areas brings with it an increase in potential for civil disturbance and public health issues. Growth in business and housing , along with the proximity to Chicago, increase the potential for terrorist and enemy attack. Nuclear powe r plants, refineries, large entertainment venues, an army training center, and the nearness of Chicago, all make Will County attractive as a target for terrorists and our enemies. An attack in Will County would bring the attention that terrorists seek and produce damage that could impact other areas of our country. Each of the following hazard profiles provide s a summary of their characteristics, the risk that they pose, and the vulnerabilities of the County that require the attention and planning of fi rst responders and supporting agencies to protect the welfare of the public of Will County. Future What the economic future holds for Will County can only be estimated. The Chicago metropolitan area continues to grow outward into the surrounding counties . Of these collar counties, Will County is expected to be the fastest growing. It is forecasted that the area as a whole will grow by 25% while Will County is expected to grow over 50% within the next twenty years. This means that potentially 180 square miles of new land could be developed over this time frame. Most of this land would be used for residential purposes with some used for business and industrial use. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 3 The building of the South Suburban Airport is a factor that will have the greate st effect on the County's growth. If it is built, there will be a large demand for services, infrastructure, workers, housing, schools, etc. to support its function. This additional source for transportation of goods and people will increase the rate of business development. This means there will be more people and property to protect from hazards, more technology and businesses that may present a hazard, and more people and businesses that could attract or be affected by societal hazards. Assessing the risks, planning, mitigating hazards, and preparing for emergenci es will remain essential activities to ensure the safety of Will County's residents. Routine updating of demographic data and careful tracking of hazards will be important and will require a coordinated effort of all agencies and municipalities responsibl e for a proactive approach t hrough mitigation planning within Will County. The information concerning changes in hazards and risks and their impact on the County's population and assets will be critical in maintaining and updating mitigation plans. County Assets Will County's assets lie in its people, institutions, businesses, infrastructure, land, and natural resources. The reason for conducting preparedness plans , such as this mitigation plan, is to evaluate the impact of hazards on these assets and to determine effective methods to protect people and property. The following charts and graphs summarize these assets.

It is visible as a vortex, a whirlpool -like column of winds rotating around a hollow cavity in which centrifugal forces produce a partial vacuum. Conditions leading to tornadoes often result in other dangerous storm activities such as severe thunderstorms, high winds, lightning, ha il, and heavy rain. Tornado formation requires the presence of air layers that differ in temperature, moisture, density, and wind flow. The rotary winds twist and rip at structures and the tornado's central vacuum creates explosive pressure changes. Tor nadoes, one of nature's most violent storms, tend to be short -lived but intensely menacing. They have the potential to destroy everything in their path and pose a significant threat to life. Most tornadoes have a three -stage life cycle where they devel op, mature, and dissipate. The average path of a tornado is approximately one -eighth mile wide and three miles long with a wind speed of forty or more miles per hour; however, tornadoes have been recorded that have traveled a path over one mile wide and a lmost three -hundred miles long. Frequency of tornadoes varies by season, but in Illinois, most occur from April through July during the late afternoon usually when there is warm, humid, and unsettled weather. Of the 1,200 tornadoes that occur in the Unit ed States each year, roughly 3% result in casualties. Improved warning systems have drastically reduced tornado related deaths since the 1950's. Tornado intensities have been measured by the Fujita Damage Scale which rates tornadoes based on damage caused and not size of storm. The scale ranges from F1 to F12; however, no tornadoes have measured over F5. National Weather Service: Chicago, IL Weather Forecast Office Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessme nt November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 9 Weak tornadoes (F0- F1): Represent 80% of all tornadoes with less than 5% of tornado deaths. Their time span ranges from one to over ten minutes long. They can have a path length of up to three miles and a wind speed of 60 to 115 miles per hour. Strong tornadoes (F2- F3): Comprise 19% of all tornadoes with less than 30% of tornado deaths. Their time span is 20 minutes or longer, their path length is i n excess of 15 miles. Their wind speeds range from 110 to 205 miles per hour. Most unusual are the violent tornadoes (F4- F5): They represent 1% of all tornadoes but constitute 70% of all tornado deaths. Violent tornadoes last an hour or longer, have a path length in excess of 50 miles. They have record ed wind speeds of over 200 miles per hour. The Fu jita scale has been in use for 42 years. It has been a useful tool for categorizing tornadoes; however, the scale's primary limitations are a lac k of damage indicators, no account of construction quality and variability, and no definitive correlation between damage and wind -speed. Researchers, building on the original Fujita Scale, developed t he Enhanced Fujita Scale to overcome these limitations. This new scale is still a set of wind estimates (not measurements) based on damage . It uses three -second gust estimate s at the point of damage based on a judgment of 8 levels of damage to 28 indicators. The use of the Enhanced Fujita Scale began in 2007. ENHANCED FUJITA SCALE CATEGORY 3 SECOND GUST (mph) EFFECTS EF0 65 - 85 Light damage. Peels surface off some roofs; some damage to gutters or siding; branches broken off trees; shallow -rooted trees pushed over. EF1 86 - 110 Moderate damage. Roofs severely stripped: mobile homes overturned or badly damaged; loss of exterior doors; windows and other glass broken EF2 111 - 135 Considerable damage. Roofs torn off well- constructed houses; foundations of frame homes shifted; mobile homes completely destroyed; large trees snapped or uprooted; light -object missiles generated; cars lifted off ground. EF3 136 - 165 Severe damage. Entire stories of well - constructed hous es destroyed; severe damage to large buildings such as shopping malls; trains overturned; trees debarked; heavy cars lifted off the ground and thrown; structures with weak foundations blown away some distance. EF4 166 - 200 Devastating damage. Well -const ructed houses and whole frame houses completely leveled; cars thrown and small missiles generated. EF5 > 200 Incredible damage. Strong frame houses leveled off foundations and swept away; automobile - sized missiles fly through the air in excess of 100 m ( 109 yd); high- rise buildings have significant structural deformation; incredible phenomena will occur. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessme nt November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 10 History Statewide, Illinois is ranked high in terms of the number of tornadoes and tornado impacts (damages, deaths, and injuries). In fact, Illinois has experienced some of the worst tornadoe s in U.S. history. The infamous Tri -State tornado occurred on March 18, 1925, passing through southern Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana, leaving 695 dead and 2000 injured. The Mattoon tornado of May 26, 1917, left 101 dead and 638 injured. Will County has experienced sixty tornadoes since 1950 or roughly an average of one tornado per year. Most have been weak tornadoes over this time period, ten have been strong storms, and one was a violent F5. The strong storms that have occurred over the years have al so impacted the lives and property of the County's citizens. Though there are no absolutes and you can see from the table of Impact of Tornadoes on Will County that tornadoes can occur at any time of year, but are more likely to happen between 3PM and 7P M during April, May and June.

Thus, it is important to have an understanding of how tornadoes occur, how to educate and notify the public of the ir impending occurrence, and how to prepare and recover from the storm. The most important mitigating factor is advanced warning which does not prevent property damage but does save lives. The Emergency Alert System (EAS) is a n ational system used by state and local governments to disperse emergency information by connecting the agencies with media and broadcasting stations. Along with the EAS, Will County Emergency Management Agency (WCEMA) also monitors the State EOC's State P rimary station (45.44 MHZ) and Service's (NWS) weather radio (162.425 MHZ) out of Chicago. The NWS monitors atmospheric conditions and issues a Tornado Watch when formation of a tornado is possible. When a tornado is sighted, th e NWS issues a Tornado Warning identifying the tornado's location, direction it is moving, and speed. Will County has outdoor warning sirens and an enhanced emergency alert system used to notify registered public that an emergency exists through email, pag ers, cell phone text message , or voice message on home phone s. These various information sources are used to create a web of redundancy. This system of cross monitoring protects the public should one notification mode fail to forward the information. T ornado preparedness information is listed on the WCEMA website. Because tornadoes are so prevalent within the County, everyone must be prepared for the potential hazard so that they can respond promptly and efficiently.

As early as Thursday morning, November 14, most of central and southeast Illinois was included in the severe weather outlook for Sunday. At that range, areas are highlighted if there is at least a 30% chance of receiving severe weather. The outl ook from late Saturday morning, indicate d a 45% chance of severe w eather over much of the Midwest and a 10% chance of seeing significant severe weather (defined as either tornadoes of at least EF-2 strength, winds of 75 mph, hail of at least 2\" in diameter , or any combination thereof) with in 25 miles of any given point. Will County Emge rncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 17 Around midnight Sunday morning, the outlook from the Storm Prediction Center highlighted eastern Illinois as being in a \"high risk\" of severe weather and by the 7 am update, expanded it f urther west to near I -55. At 8:40 am, Tornado Watch #561 was issued for most of Illinois. SPC declared this as a \"Particularly Dangerous Situation\" (PDS) watch, meaning there was a threat for several intense, long - track tornadoes, potential for many repo rts of large hail over 2 inches in diameter, and damaging wind gusts potentially in excess of 80 mph. The NWS offices in Lincoln, Chicago, Milwaukee, Davenport, and St. Louis participated in a conference call with SPC around 8:30 am to discuss the issuanc e of this watch. Will County Emge rncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 18 The severe storms and tornadoes left significant damage in Diamond and the area from Manhattan to Frankfort. Fifteen Illinois counties, including Will County , were granted federal disaster declarations on November 26, 2013. Local, State and Federal agencies are currently working to assess the damage incurred from the storms.

Before the tornado developed, the severe thunderstorm produced wind gusts in the 80- 100 mph range. The F5 tornado was o n the ground for over 16 miles, touching down first near Oswego and lifting 20 minutes later in Joliet. It killed twenty -nine people, injured 350 people, and caused damages of $250 million. Developing beyond the usual tornado season, this fast forming and deadly storm caught everyone off guard. The storm was a testament that tornadoes can occur any time of year. It also provided valuable information to the County and local agencies allowing improve ment in preparedness, response, and recovery plans. The Plainfield Tornado challenged both meteorologists and citizens in terms of tornado preparedness. Substantial safety measures were enacted in the years following the tornado; among these are frequent and regular tornado drills performed in schools. The de velopment of Next Generation Radar (NEXRAD) contributes greatly to the ability of meteorologists to recognize tornadic activity. NEXRAD contained the ability to detect the wind speed and direction inside the storm. The ability to see rotation inside a stor m on both the microscale (tornadic) and mesoscale (supercellular) measurements has allowed forecasters to issue severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings in more timely fashion and with a higher probability of detection.

Safe rooms were one action item that participants discussed. The expense to retrofit existing structures can be prohibitive, but the County and communities can en courage the construction and use of safe rooms in new construction. Through building codes, wind resistant construction and materials can be encouraged to make structures more resistant to wind storms. Communities adopting international building code standards are listed in Chapter 5 , page 5- 10. Forecasting of severe weather by the National Weather Service (NWS) continues to improve providing timely alerts advising the public to take cover. The County has been working together with the NWS, the U.S. Geological Survey, GIS, web -developers, and others to electronically link monitoring systems and use the latest communication tools to improve forecasting and alert systems in order to provide the public with real -time storm information. The County and communities have been distributing education materials on the dangers of severe weather and how to prepare through websites, social media, newsletters, news media, and community events. Some sources of preparedness materials include FEMA, American Red Cross, Illinois EMA, CDC, and Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH). Risk Characterization A tornado can occur at any time of the year requiring the County to be prepared at all times. Since 1950, Illinois has average d 37 tornadoes per year; however, 105 tornadoes were reported in 1998 and 107 in 1974. At least 24 tornadoes were rep orted during the storms of November 17, 2013. Out of all of the counties within Illinois, Will County has been ranked as one of the top counties in the state affected by tornadoes. Due to the destructive nature of tornadoes and wind, these events impact human life, health, and public safety. Community -wide impacts include: utility damage and outages, infrastructure damage (transportation and communication systems), struc tural Will County Emge rncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 24 damage, and damaged or destroyed critical facilities. Tornadoes can also cause severe transportation problems and make travel extremely dangerous. Impact: High Damage to Buildings Although tornadoes strike at random, making all buildings vulnerabl e, three types of structures are more likely to suffer damage: Mobile homes Homes on crawlspaces (more susceptible to lift) Buildings with large spans, such as airplane hangers, gymnasiums and factories Structures within the direct path of a tornado vortex are often reduced to rubble. However, structures adjacent to the tornado's path are often severely damaged by high winds flowing into the tornado vortex, known as inflow winds. It is here, adjacent to the tornado's path, where the building type and construction techniques are critical to the structure's survival. Tornado impact to buildings is high. Critical Facilities Because a tornado can hit anywhere in the County, all critical facilities are susceptible to being hit. Schools are a particular concer n for two reasons: They have large numbers of people present, either during school or as a storm shelter . They have large span areas, such as gyms and theaters. The 1990 Plainfield tornado was an unfortunate example of this. It struck the Plainfield High School, Grand Prairie Elementary School, St. Mary Immaculate Church, and the gymnasium to the Church's elementary school. Cost to repair the two public schools was estimated at up to $35 million. The cost for the church and its school was $5 million. Ot her large span buildings were also affected in 1990. In addition to the schools and their gyms, hangers at the Aurora A irport and Joliet's Essington Road Fire Station were damaged. Health and Safety The numerous deaths and injuries incurred by tornadoes s ince the 1950's give testament to the threat Will County's population faces from tornadoes. Flying debris, collapsing structures, or being swept Will County Emge rncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 25 away by wind are just a few of the elements that may cause death or injury. Following a tornado, damaged buil dings are a potential health hazard due to instability, electrical system damage, and gas leaks. Sewage and water lines may also be damaged. However, these problems would be localized. Impact upon people is high. Economic Impact The major impact of a to rnado on the local economy is damage to businesses and infrastructure. A heavily damaged business, especially one that was barely making a profit, often has to be closed. The post-disaster damage report stated that at least 50 businesses were destroyed by the 1990 tornado. Infrastructure damage is usually limited to above ground utilities, such as power lines. The 1990 tornado knocked out two 345,000 volt transmission towers, leaving 65,000 Com Ed customers without power. Damage to phone lines left 14,000 customers without service. Damage to utility lines can usually be repaired or replaced relatively quickly. Damage to roads and railroads is usually localized. If it can't be repaired promptly, alternate transportation routes are usually available. Transportation was disrupted when highways were closed during the August , 1990, storm due to high winds and debris. Public expenditures include search and rescue, shelters, transportation systems, and emergency protection measures. The large expenses ar e for repairs to public facilities and clean -up and disposal of debris. Most public facilities are insured, so the economic impact on the local treasury may be small. Clean -up and disposal can be a larger problem, especially with limited Will County Emge rncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 26 landfill capacit y near the damage site. Preliminary damage assessments for public expenditures after the 1990 tornado totaled $4 million, 2/3 of that for debris clearance. Future Occurrences With 60 occurrences of tornadoes in Will County over the last 63 years, the li kelihood of another tornado occurrence is approximately 95% in any given year. Tornadoes, like other climatological hazards, are not bound to a particular path or location; therefore, all jurisdictions within Will County have the same probability of being struck. The 2013 Illinois Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan rates the tornado hazard for Will County as high. TORNADO PROBABILITY Type Number of Occurrences Since 1950 Annual Mean Tornadoes 60 .95 Will County Emge rncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 27 WINTER / ICE STORMS Hazard Characterization The National Weather Service refers to Winter Storms as the Deceptive Killers Six or more inches of snow have fallen within a forty -eight hour period; because most deaths are indirectly related to the storm. Instead, people die in traffic accidents on icy roads and of hypothermia from prolonged exposure to cold. A winter storm is considered to be severe when: A snow storm has produced conditions, such as high winds, leading to proper ty damage, death, or injuries regardless of the amount of snowfall; There i s a glaze storm in which ten percent of the cooperative U.S. Weather Bureau substations in Illinois have reported glaze; or There is a glaze storm in which property damage, deaths, or injuries have occurred. Snow and ice are threats to most of the U.S. du ring the northern hemisphere's winter, which begins December 21st and ends March 21st Ice Storm: Occurs when moisture falls and freezes immediately upon impact. Ice storms occur when cold air at the surface is overridden by warm, moist air at higher altitudes. . During the early and late months of the winter season, snow becomes warmer, giving it a greater tendency to melt on contact or stick to the surface. The beginning and end of the winter season also brings a greater chance of freezing rain and sleet. There are many ways for winter storms to form, but certain key ingredients are needed. First temperatures must be below freezing in the clouds and near the ground. There m ust be a source of moisture in the form of evaporating water. Severe winter storms are fueled by strong temperature gradients and an active upper -level cold jet stream. When you hear the term \"severe winter storm warning\", freezing temperatures, heavy snowfall, or freezing rain come to mind. There are three categories of winter storms: Blizzard: This is the most dangerous of all winter storms. A blizzard combines low temperatures, heavy snowfall, and winds of at least 35 miles per hour, reducing visibi lity to one -quarter mile or less for at least three hours. Heavy Snow Storm: Will produce six inches or more of snow in 48- hours or less. Will County Emge rncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 28 Winter and ice storms can cause widespread damage and disruption. Heavy snow or ice can paralyze transportation systems, cause automobile accidents, strand vehicles, damage building roofs, in terrupt communication and electrical power service, adversely affect business continuity, or cause people to have heart attacks while shoveling heavy snow. Snow, along with high winds and extreme cold, can incapacitate the entire affected area. Temperatu re and wind produce a \"wind chill factor\" which applies only to people and other living things. Wind chill is based on the rate of heat loss from exposed skin. As wind increases, heat is carried away from the body at an accelerated rate that drives down the body temperature. Wind chill measures how cold the wind makes exposed skin feel and helps to predict the likelihood for frostbite or hypothermia. Ice or glazing can also incapacitate an area and damage vegetation, buildings, and communication system s by downing utility lines and poles . Secondary effects of winter/ ice storms are flooding, electrocution from downed power lines, or freezing to death when isolated or trapped by blizzard conditions. These storms also result in extensive damage because t hey can persist over longer periods of time than all other forms of severe weather. Winter/ ice storms cause devastating damage and pose a dangerous threat to life by shutting down normal day- to-day operations. The amount and extent of snow or ice, air temperature, wind speed and event duration are characteristics of a severe winter storm. All of these combine to determine the severity of the storm. Snow Storm: If melted, an inch of snow falling at 32 degrees contains twice the amount of water as an in ch of snow falling at 10 degrees. This relationship determines whether snow will blow and drift with high winds that make conditions hazardous for hours or perhaps days. If the temperature is near freezing when snow falls, it rarely drifts. As the tempe rature falls farther from the freezing mark, then snow is lighter and more prone to blow and drift. Will County Emge rncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 29 Ice Storm: Factors in how much damage will occur are the amounts of rain causing icing to take place, the strength of the wind, and whether or not the stor m strikes an urban or rural area. Will County Emge rncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 30 TERMS USED BY WEATHER FORECASTERS Freezing Rain Rain that freezes when it hits the ground, creating a coating of ice on roads, walkways, trees and power lines. Sleet Rain that turns to ice pel lets before reaching the ground. Sleet also causes roads to freeze and become slippery. Winter Storm Watch A winter storm is possible in your area. Winter Storm Warning A winter storm is occurring, or will soon occur in your area. Blizzard Warning Sustained winds or frequent gusts to 35 miles -per-hour or greater and considerable falling or blowing snow (reducing visibility to less than a quarter mile) are expected to prevail for a period of three hours or longer. Frost/Freeze Warning Below freezing tem peratures are expected.

Federal Emergency Declarations of severe winter storms in Will County have occurred three times: January 16, 1979 with over $58 million in damages throughout Illinois January 8, 1999 with over $40 million in damages throughout Illinois January 17, 2001, with just under $23 million in damages throughout Illinois January 31 - February 3, 2011 , approximately $250,000 damages in Will County One of the worst winter storms to impact the State was on January 26 -27, 1967, when as much as 23 inches of snow fell on Moline (Rock Island County) and the Chicago area, paralyzing O'Hare Internationa l Airport. Travel throughout Northern Illinois was curtailed and areas to the south experienced a glaze of ice which made travel virtually impossible until January 29, 1967. Fifty deaths were directly attributed to this storm. Illinois has experienced a severe winter storm each winter for over a century and experiences an average of five severe storms per year during the November -April period . These storms may be those with only heavy snow, or with snow and ice mixed, or with ice (glaze) only. Although the average number of severe winter storms is five per winter, as many as 18 have occurred in one winter (1977- 1978) and as few as two (1921- 1922). Severe winters are characterized by either extremely cold periods one to two months in duration, or by se vere ice storms or heavy snowfalls occurring repeatedly over a period of six to twelve weeks. Ice storms tend to fill a 50-80 mile band between heavy snows to the north and rain to the south. Being in the northern portion of the state, Will County experiences an annual average of 140 days at or below 32\u00b0F and 36 inches of snow. Average Number of Days with 6 or More Inches of Snowfall Per Winter 1971-2000 \"0.33 days per winter\" means one storm every 3 years, on average \"0.5 days per winter\" means one storm every othe r year, on average Source: Illinois State Water Survey, 2003 Will County Emge rncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 32 Winter Storm - January 8, 1999 Federal Emergency Declaration #3134 Public Assistance - $1,010,500 A winter storm struck portions of the Midwest on January 1 to 3, 1999, prod ucing 9 to 22 inches of snow and northeast winds gusting to over 30 mph in the Chicago area. Soon after the snow ended, record low temperatures occurred on January 3rd and 4th with values of -20\u00b0F or lower. The governor of Illinois declared the entire st ate a disaster on January 4th County and municipalities incurred problems and high costs . The worst impact was the storm's affect on transportation which was either halted or delayed for two to four days and the source of many accidents. Automobiles, trains, airplanes, boats, and snowmobiles were impacted. Issu es that developed as a result of this winter storm included: with snow removal - this proved to be the major share of public assistance . Major vehicle accidents occurred on roadways with deaths (1 in Will County) and injuries . Retail businesses closed, transportation of raw materials and finished goods were delayed, and schools closed . Stranded traveling motorists we re housed in emergency shelters. Vehicles parked on city streets were buried as snow removal equipment tried to clear streets . Blood shortages occurred . Fortunately, the storm was accurately predicted several days in advance allowing communities to prepare , was spread out over a long duration, and occurred on a long holiday weekend. Thos e factors helped mitigate the impact on transportation and commerce. Severe Winter Storm and Snow - January 31 to February 3, 2011 Federal Disaster Declaration #1960 Public Assistance - $2,976,578 Northern Illinois and northwest Indiana were walloped by a powerful winter storm between January 31 and February 2, 2011. An initial period of light accumulating snow occurred from the evening of January 31st into the morning of February 1st, including lake effect snowfall over northeastern Illinois. From the afternoon of February 1st through the early morning of February 2nd, the snowstorm was accompanied by fierce winds, gusting to 50 to 60 mph and higher. The intense winds and heavy snow reduced visibility to near zero at times and produced widespread snowdrif ts of 2 to 5 feet, and a few drifts of 10 feet or more. Will County Emge rncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 33 Up to 18 inches of snow fell in Will County. This storm was classified as a blizzard, with sustained winds or frequent gusts of 35 mph or greater and severely reduced visibility for a prolonged peri od of time. L ightning was observed all across the region on February 1st Will County prepositioned cots throughout the County and anticipated that the assistance provided by the American Red Cross would be limited due to widespread difficult travel conditions. Most shelterees, in excess of 250, were rescued from stranded vehicles. Limited power outages occurred with small numbers of customers affected. The major issue was the clearing of roads being hampered by drifting snow and numerous abandoned vehicles. The 2011 storm was also well forecasted. This allowed the County and communities to alert the public utilizing traditional news media along with website and social media tools. These communication tools were also used to provide the public with winter storm readiness tips. The advanced notice of the storm, better communications and planning, and better snow clearing techniques resulted in far less disruption. As a result, the number of stranded vehicles with this storm was much lower than the 1967 blizzard, but the photos and footage of the stranded vehicles on Lake Shore Drive have left an indelible imprint on the minds of many. A major source for this information comes from the National Climatic Data Ce nter (NCDC) which receives data from the National Weather Service (NWS). Following is the information collected for blizzards, cold/wind chill, extreme cold/wind chill, heavy snow, and ice storm. The following are additional winter events as defined by t he NCDC. and increased in frequency late that night. Cold/Wind Chill Period of low temperatures or wind chill temperatures reaching or exceeding locally/regionally defined advisory (typical value is -18\u00b0F or colder) conditions, on a widespread or localized basis. Will County Emge rncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 34 Extreme Cold/Wind Chill A period of extremely low temperatures or wind chill temperatures reaching or exceeding locally/regionally defined warning criteria (typical value around -35\u00b0F or colder), on a widespread or localized basis.

Jurisdictions that have adopted the International Building Code (IBC) and International Residential Code (IRC) are listed in Chapter 5, page 5-10. Trees and other vegetation cause about 20% of all electric service interruptions. Preventive pruning around aerial power lines is vital to providing reliable electr ic service. ComEd, the electric provider in Will County, has a routine tree maintenance that keeps above ground power lines clear. This program includes tree trimming, tree removal and clearing storm -damaged trees Will County Emge rncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 36 or tree limbs from power lines. Their vegetation management crews are trained in proper arboricultural pruning techniques, which meet the standards set by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). ComEd is also upgrading overhead power lines with new overhead cables. The new cables ar e stronger, have a protective coating and are spaced closer together to help reduce power outages caused by severe weather, trees and wildlife. Additionally, overhead power lines are being replaced in some areas and with underground cable so customers experience fewer power outages. ComEd also employs smart grids that monitor the electric grid and respond to potential problems and interruptions and smart switches that automatically reroute electricity around problem areas so customers experience fewer and shorter power outages. A leading cause of death during winter storms is from automobile or other transportation accidents. Strategies to reduce accidents is planning for adequate road and debris clearing capabilities, using snow fencing to limit blowing a nd drifting of snow over critical roadway segments, and utilizing roadway heating technology to prevent snow/ice buildup. Public education about severe winter weather impacts and how the public can prepare is essential. Will County EMA and communities hav e ongoing public education for severe winter weather preapration through websites, social media, alert systems, traditional news media, and community events. Education outreach continues to improve as technology expands communication tool choices. Will Co unty and the communities work with the American Red Cross to maintain a system of warming centers to protect vulnerable populations and people who become stranded on the roadways. Risk Characterization Impact: High Damage to Buildings Historically, roofs would collapse due to heavy snow loads, but most buildings are now constructed with low temperatures, snow loads , and ice storms in mind. With today's energy consciousness, buildings are much better insulated than they were 50 years ago. Winter storms do not have a major impact on buildings. Impact on buildings is low . Will County Emge rncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 37 Critical Facilities The major impacts of snow and ice storms on property are to utilities and roads. Power lines and tree limbs coated with heavy ice result in disrupted power and telephone service, often for days. Even small accumulations of ice can be extremely dangerous to motorists and pedestrians. Bridges and overpasses are particularly dangerous because they freeze before other surfaces. When transportation is disrupted, schools c lose, emergency services are delayed, some businesses close, and some government services are delayed. Impact on critical facilities is low . Health and Safety Winter storms bring the following two types of safety hazards: Weather -related hazards, including hazardous driving and walking conditions and heart attacks from strenuous activity such as shoveling snow. Extreme cold, from the low temperatures, wind chill, and loss of heat due to power outages . In the United States, the number of deaths peaks in mi dwinter and reaches a low point in late summer, but most deaths are not directly related to the weather. Certain populations are especially vulnerable to the cold, including the elderly, the homeless, and lower income families with heating problems. Abou t 70% of the injuries caused by snow and ice storms result from vehicle accidents and 25% occur to people caught out in the storm. Extreme cold can result in people and animals suffering from frostbite and hypothermia. Frostbite is damage to tissue cause d by the effects of ice crystals in frozen tissue. Extremities (hands, feet, ears, and nose) with more circulation difficulties are most frequently affected. Hypothermia is the lowering of the core body temperature. It is \"clinically significant\" when the body temperature is below 95\u00b0F. Severe hypothermia occurs when the body's temperature drops below 85\u00b0F, resulting in unconsciousness. If help does not come, death follows. Great care is needed to properly re - warm a person, even in mild cases. Health and safety impact is moderate. Will County Emge rncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 38 Economic Impact Loss of power means businesses and manufacturing concerns must close down. Loss of access due to snow or ice covered roads has a similar effect. There are also impacts when people cannot get to work, to school, or to the store. The cost of snow removal for winter events can be significant and difficult to budget for. Economic impact is moderate . Future Occurrences Based on weather patterns and past severe winter storm events, the probability of a winter storm is high for any given year. The 2013 Illinois Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan rates the severe winter storm hazard for Will County as high and considers one -hundred percent of the population at risk from a severe winter storm in the State of Illinois.

They occur anytime of year, but more frequently during the warm spring and summer months. Thunderstorms typically only last thirty to forty minutes. They form when a shallow layer of warm, moist air meets up with a deeper layer of cool, dry air. All thunderstorms follow a three -stage life cycle. The cumulus stage is the development period where the storm consists only of updrafts or upward moving air currents. The updrafts reach heights of 20,000 feet above ground. The mature stage is the strongest and most dangerous stage of the storm cycle. Upward and downward moving air currents collide with precipitation resulting in the downdraft area. As the downdraft reaches the ground, i t spreads out and forms a gust front where damaging winds may develop. In the dissipating stage, excessive precipitation and downdrafts weaken the storm, gust fronts move away depleting the energy of the storm. Will County Emge rncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 40 Thunder storms can fall into four categ ories. Singe -cell storms are typically weak, short -lived, and poorly organized. Multicell cluster storms are the most common type and are a cluster of cells moving as one unit. Multicell line storms are squall lines that have a long line of storms with a continuous gust front from the forward edge of the storm. Supercell storms have a single updraft, are very strong, and produce severe weather. Along with wind that can damage property, lightning also poses a serious hazard causing fire to property that is struck and serious injury or death to individuals who are struck. Severe thunderstorms are most likely to happen in the spring and summer months and during the afternoon and evening hours but can occur year -round and at all hours. Thunderstorms can br ing four hazards: Flooding , Lightning , High winds, tornadoes and microbursts , and Hail. In Illinois , thunderstorms occur when there is a collision of moist, warm air moving north from the Gulf of Mexico with colder fronts moving east from the Rocky Mount ains resulting in cold air overriding a layer of warm air causing the warm air to rise rapidly. Thunderstorms may occur singly, in clusters, or in lines. In the course of a few hours, it is possible for several thunderstorms to affect one location or a s ingle thunderstorm to affect one location for an extended time. Thunderstorms typically are 15 miles in diameter and produce heavy rain anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. Average Number of Thunderstorm Days per Year in the U.S. Source: Nationa l Weather Service Will County Emge rncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 41 Of the estimated 100,000 thunderstorms each year , approximately 10 percent are c lassified severe. Severe storms either produce hail of at least three -quarters of an inch thick, have winds of 58 miles per hour or higher, or produce a tornado. In Illinois, severe thunderstorms are most likely to happen in the spring and summer and fre quently occur in the late afternoon or evening. Thunderstorms can bring heavy rain, strong winds, hail, lightning and tornadoes. Thunderstorms can cause several types of damaging wind. A downward rush of cool descending air from a thunderstorm is a micr oburst. Lightning occurs during all thunderstorms and is an electrical discharge that results from the buildup of positive and negative charges. Lightning appears as a \"bolt\" when the buildup becomes strong with the flash of light occurring between the clouds and the ground. In a split second , the bolt of lightning reaches a temperature approaching 50,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Lightning has killed 29 people and injured hundreds more in Illinois since 1990. In 2001, Illinois ranked second in the United States for lightning fatalities. T hunder is the rapid heating and cooling of air near the lightning. In addition to lightning, a thunderstorm can also produce hail which can be very destructive to plants/crops, animals and propert y causing nationally over a billion dollars in damage each year. Hail can be as small as a pea and as large as a softball. Most hail has a diameter smaller than a dime; however, 1901 -1998 Will County Will County Emge rncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 42 Average a nnual clo ud-to-ground lightning flashes per square mile, 1989 -1996 there are records of hailstones weighing more than a pound. Hail rarely ca uses injuries, but it can cause millions of dollars in damages to crops, vehicles, and buildings. These balls of ice begin as a large frozen raindrop. Super cooled water droplets hit ice crystals and freeze instantly. The hailstones grow as more and more droplets hit these ice balls and freeze as they fall through the clouds. As the hailstones reach the bottom of the clouds the wind updrafts may send the hail back up into the cloud to repeat the process and continue to grow. When the weight of the hailstones becomes too heavy to be supported by the updrafts, they fall out of the clouds. The very largest recorded hailstone was over 5.6 inches in diameter and weighed 26 ounces; however, large hail is usually less than two inches in diameter and most i s smaller than a dime. Will County Average annual precipitation from thunderstorms (inches) and as percent of total annual precipitation Will County Emge rncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 43 History Will County has experienced over 200 severe storm events since 1950. Federal Emergency Declarations of severe storms in Will County have occurred f ive times: June 30, 1981, over $4 million in damages t hroughout Illinois March 29, 1985, almost $8 million in damages throughout Illinois July 25, 1996, almost $259 million in damages throughout Illinois April 23, 2004, almost $6 million in damages throughout Illinois August 23, 2007, over $230 thousand in damages throughout Will County Although they do not receive as much recognition as tornado events, thunderstorm winds cause more damage year -to-year than tornadoes. In 1993 alone, Illinois experienced 38 events of thunderstorm winds which caused a minimum estimate of well over five million dollars in damage, while the 34 tornadoes caused a maximum of just over 1.5 million dollars. Seven severe thunderstorms traversed the State in June of 1993, creating most of this damage, but significant losses occurred in seven other months. In the 10-year period from 1981 to 1990, damage estimates from severe wind equaled or exceeded damages caused by tornadoes in five of the years. In addition, death tolls from severe winds exceeded tornado deaths for six of these ye ars, and the number of injuries caused by severe w ind was greater in three years (data from Storm Data publication, NOAA/NWS). The damages caused by high winds have been relatively consistent from year -to-year. Nationwide it is estimated that 25 million cloud- to-ground lightning flashes occur each year, 1,000 people are injured, and 80 are killed with about $5 billion in economic impact resulting from lightning. According to Mr. Chris Miller, WCM, National Weather Service, Lincoln, IL, \"Illinois experien ces nearly 650,000 lightning strikes each year.\" Illinois ranks high among the 50 states for lightning fatalities. Over the past 40 years, 96 people have been killed by lightning in Illinois. As a result , IEMA and the NWS have recently established the L ightning Safety Awareness Week as a public education project. Hail occurs frequently in Illinois averaging 74 times a year or 3,951 times since 1950. There have been no deaths, but 23 injuries. Hail does extensive damage: property damage over $73 milli on and crop damage over $5 million in the last 53 years. The potential size of hail stones illustrate the damage they can cause. April 23, 1961, several six inch hail stones were reported in Kankakee, IL. While six inches is very unusual, 46 events had hail stones greater than three inches and in the 2 -3 inch range.

Location Date Mag. High Damage to Buildings As with tornadoes, mobile homes are at a high risk to damage from thunderstorms. Wind and water damage can result when windows are broken by flying debris or hail. Lightning can cause direct damage to structures (especially those without lightning protection systems) and can cause fires that damage forests and structures. Straight line winds will damage roofs, overturn or push mobile homes off foundations, push aut os off the road and may destroy attached garages. Straight line winds are the leading cause of wind related damage. Although they do not receive as much recognition as tornado events, high winds cause more damage year -to-year than tornadoes. Hail can i nflict severe damage to roofs, windows and siding, depending on hailstone size and winds. The size of hailstones is a direct function of the severity and size of the storm. Significant damage does not result until the stones reach 1.5 inches in diameter, which occurs in less than half of all hailstorms. Will County Emge rncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 46 Critical Facilities Critical facilities are susceptible to the same damage and disruption from thunderstorms as other buildings. Emergency operations can be disrupted as thunderstorms and lightning affect radio communications and antennas are a prime target for lightning. To date, there is no record of critical facilities having incurred any damages due to severe storms. Damage to critical facilities is considered moderate. Health and Safety No special h ealth problems are attributable to thunderstorms, other than the potential for tetanus and other diseases that arise from injuries and damaged property. Serious burns or death are the common outcomes when lightning strikes a human being. Overall health hazard: Low The threat to life varies by the cause of death. Between 1995 and 2000, the N WS reported 20 people in Illinois were killed by flash floods, wind , and lightning resulting from thunderstorms. Hail rarely causes loss of life. Lighting kills mor e people than tornadoes. Most lightning fatalities and injuries occur outdoors at recreation events and under or near trees. Most of these deaths can be prevented through safe practices. Much information has come out over the last 20 years about lightni ng safety, for example, before 1990, an average of 89 people were killed by lightning each year. By 2000, this number had dropped to 52. Hail occurs frequently in Illinois averaging 74 times a year or 3,951 times since 1950. There have been no deaths, but 23 injuries. Economic Impact Thunderstorms can impact transportation and utilities. Airplanes have crashed when hit by downbursts or lightning. Automobiles and their windshields are subject to damage by hail. Power lines can be knocked out by lightning or knocked down by wind and debris. Lightning can also cause power surges that damage appliances, electronic equipment and computers. However, many buildings have lightning rods and back up power systems that can recover quickly. Cost of clean- up by towns can be extensive . Will County Emge rncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 47 Future Occurrences All counties are susceptible to severe storms. At any one time, it h as been determined that over 25% of the County population might experience severe storms. This determination is supported by Mr. Chris Miller, WCM, National Weather Service, Lincoln, IL, as follows: \"Damage from severe thunderstorms is usually on a much b roader spatial scale in the state of Illinois. The past 49 years of data indicated that more than 11,000 reports of severe thunderstorm damage occurred (approximately 7,000 wind and 4,000 hail reports) in the state of Illinois. Approximately 80% of the s evere thunderstorms are multicellular or a supercell hybrid, which are capable of producing damaging wind and/or large hail over approximately a 400 to 500 square mile area. The remaining severe thunderstorms are squall lines, which can produce damage ove r 100% of the affected counties. Thus, the vulnerability to severe thunderstorms should be high (greater than 25% of the population affected) in each county across Illinois.\" This is reinforced by a study done by Stanley Chagnon of Chagnon Climatologist, in his publication \"Thunderstorms Across the Nation - An Atlas of Storms, Hail, and Their Damages in the 20th Century\" . This study indicated that in an analysis of thunderstorm caused catastrophes, Illinois ranked 4th in the United States in total thunde rstorm catastrophes between 1949 and 1998.\" The 2013 Illinois Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan rates the severe storms hazard for Will County as severe. SEVERE STORM PROBABILITY Type Number of Occurrences Since 19 96 Annual Mean Thunderstorm & High Wind 109 6.4 Lightning 24 1.4 Hail 88 5.1 Will County Emge rncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 48 FLOOD, FLASH FLOOD and ICE JAMS Hazard Characterization Rivers and streams naturally overflow onto th e lands adjacent to them. These lands, or flood plains, act as a natural reservoir and temporary channel for the excess water that dissipates over time. Flooding has only become a problem since people started to occupy the floodplains. The attractivenes s of the level, fertile land of the floodplain has encouraged development despite the flood -prone nature of the area. However, as these lands have become further developed, it has given rise to an increasing public demand for protection from the economic losses caused by the inevitable flooding. Flooding may not always be directly attributable to a river, stream or lake overflowing its banks. Rather, it may simply be the combination of excessive rainfall and/or snowmelt, saturated ground, and inadequate drainage. With no place to go, the water will find the lowest elevations - areas that are often not in a floodplain. That type of flooding is becoming increasingly prevalent, as development outstrips the ability of the drainage infrastructure to properly carry and disperse the water flow. Flooding also occurs due to combined storm and sanitary sewers that cannot handle the tremendous flow of water that often accompanies storm events. Typically, the result is water backing into basements, which damages mechanical systems and can create serious public health and safety concerns. Other cases involve the ponding of waters across roads or in other low -lying areas. Except for fire, the most common hazard in the United States is flooding with thousands of incid ents occurring each year from oceans, rivers, lakes, small streams, gullies, creeks, culverts, dry streambeds or low lying ground. The Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) standard definition of a flood is: \"A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of two or more acres of normally dry land area or of two or more properties (at least one of which is the p olicyholder's property) from: Overflow of inland or tidal waters; or Unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surfa ce waters from any source; or Mudflow; or Will County Emge rncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 49 Collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or similar body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels that result in a flo od as defined above. \" A simpler definition is too much water in the wrong place. Since water circulates from clouds to the soil to streams to rivers to the oceans and returns to the clouds, a scientific definition of a flood is an imbalance in the \"hydrol ogical system\" with more water flowing through the system than the system can draw off. Hydrologic Cycle The hydrologic cycle begins with the evapora tion of water from the surface of the ocean. As moist air is lifted, it cools and water vapor condenses to form clouds. Moisture is transported around the globe until it returns to the surface as precipitation . Once the water reaches the ground, one of two processes may occur: 1) some of the water may evaporate back into the atmosphere or 2) the water may penetrate the surface and become groundwater . Groundwater either seeps its way into the oceans, rivers, and streams, or is released back into the atmosphere through transpiration . The balance of water that remains on the earth's surface is runoff , which empties into lakes, rivers and streams and is carried back to the oceans, where the cycle begins again. Summary of the Hydrologic Cycle Will County Emge rncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 50 There are many factors that contribute to the flooding of a river or stream. These factors are an abnormally heavy rainfall, the melting of packed snow, the simultaneous arrival of f lood crests from major tributaries, the formation of ice jams which block the river flow, inadequately designed storm water systems, and the creation of hydrologic structures (i.e. dams and levees) which are prone to failure and either cause an incident or aggravate an already existing one. Primarily, floods do occur in the springtime but can occur any time of the year. Types of Floods Riverine Floods: Develop slowly, sometimes over a period of days or weeks. Flash Floods: Develop quickly, sometimes in j ust a few minutes. Usually flash floods are the result of intense storms dropping large amounts of rain within a brief period. Ice Jam Floods: Jammed ice creates a dam across the channel over which the water and ice mixture continues to flow causing more jamming to occur. Backwater upstream from the ice dam may rise rapidly and overflow the channel banks. When the ice dam fails, flooding occurs releasing the water stored behind the dam. Overland Floods: Occurs outside a defined river or stream (e.g. p onding in a low lying area). Aquifer Flood: Water is expelled from a subterranean geologic formation to the surface causing flooding in the immediate area. Subterranean Flood: Water floods into tunnels that are normally dry. Structure Failure: Online str ucture or levee fails. Most riverine flooding occurs in early spring and is the result of excessive rainfall and/or the combination of rainfall and snowmelt. Ice jams are also a cause of flooding in winter and early spring and can cause dangerous flash fl ooding to occur if the ice suddenly gives way. Severe thunderstorms may cause flooding during the summer or fall, although these are normally localized and have more impact on watercourses with smaller drainage areas. The effects of a flood can be devasta ting and floods are probably the most pervasive of all natural hazards in the U.S. Between the inundation of water and the force of the current, both lives and property can be lost. People and animals can drown or be injured by the floodwaters and the current -borne debris. This Will County Emge rncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 51 same debris can also cause structural damage to buildings, roads, bridges, and railroads. Sanitary, power, water, and communication installations can be severely damaged and their systems interrupted for long periods of time. Cr ops can be carried away by the current or destroyed by the inundation. Farmlands may be deeply eroded by new channels, resulting in the loss of valuable topsoil. Many low lying areas of the County are also damaged yearly by heavy rains. Although they h ave not been declared disasters, the damage caused by this flooding is extensive. Since the flood plains have been built upon over the years, it would be financially unfeasible to buy all the property that is in the flood zones. Therefore, steps have bee n taken to evacuate homes along rivers and creeks when water is predicted to overflow the river's banks. For low lying areas, some of the flooding has been attributed to poor sewer and run -off tiles, debris, as well as other items that obstruct the natura l flow of the water. Once these problems are corrected, many of the flooding problems will be alleviated. Flood Terms 100-Year Flood Plain: A flood event that statistically has a 1 out of 100 (or one percent) chance of being equaled or exceeded on a spec ific watercourse in any given year. A flood event of this magnitude is often used to determine if flood insurance is either advisable or required on a property. 500-Year Flood Plain: A flood having a 0.2% or greater annual probability of occurring every year. Base Flood: Defined by FEMA as the flood having a 1- percent probability of being equaled or exceeded in any given year; also referred to as the 100- year flood. Flood Stage: The point at which the water level in a stream begins to cause damage to structures. It may be below the point at which the water level in a stream overtops the banks and spreads out onto the floodplain if structures are located in a floodway. Floodplain: The area adjoining a watercourse that may be covered by floodwater durin g a flood. This area, if left undisturbed, acts to store excess floodwater. The floodplain is made up of two sections: the floodway and the flood fringe. Will County Emge rncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 52 Floodway: A flow path (sometimes artificial) that carries significant volumes of floodwaters during a flood. The floodway carries the bulk of the floodwater downstream and is usually the area where water velocities and forces are the greatest. NFIP regulations require that the floodway be kept open and free from development or other structures that wou ld obstruct or divert flood flows onto other properties. Flood Fringe : The areas of a delineated floodplain adjacent to the floodway where encroachment may be permitted. Mitigation: Flood mitigation is any action taken to reduce risk to people or property from flooding and its effects. Nonstructural measures are used to make existing and future development more resilient to flooding or to preserve (or restore) natural floodplain fun ctions so that developed property is not affected. Structural measures seek to prevent the advance of flood waters, usually through an engineered measure such as a dam, levee, or floodwall. Streamflow: Commonly, people interpret the 50- year flood definition to mean \"once every 50 years.\" This is incorrect. Statistically speaking, a 50 -year flood has a 1/50 (2 %) chance of occurring in any given year. In reality, a 50 -year flood could occur two times in the same year, two years in a row, or four times over the course of 50 years. It is possible not to have a 50 -year flood over the course of 100 years. The discharge that occurs in a natural channel. FEMA uses the \"base\" flood as the basis for its regulatory requirements and flood insurance rate setting; it is also the basis for this analysis. The base flood is the 1% chance flood, i.e., the flood Will County Emge rncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 53 that has a 1% (one out of 100) chance of occurring in any given year. The 1% chance flood has also been called the 100- year flood. The \"500- year flood\" ha s a 0.2 % chance of occurring in any given year. While the odds are more remote, it is the national standard used for protecting critical facilities, such as hospitals and power plants. Flooding as a result of levee failure fits the definition of flooding when \"the u nusual and rapid accumulation of runoff or surface waters from any source\" causing the levee to fail . There are several areas in Illinois that utilize levees to protect land from peak flood levels and /or to protect land that is below river lev el. The first type of levee is designed to withstand peak flood levels that are caused by rapid snow melt or intense rain fall within the watershed. The second type of levee is typically d esigned to withstand nominal water levels on a continuous basis as well as peak flood levels. Will County Emge rncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 54 Watersheds Watersheds are an important component in handling the excess water in order to prevent flooding. Watersheds come in all shapes and sizes. Some are millions of square miles, others are just a few acres. Just as creeks drain into rivers, watersheds are nearly always part of a larger watershed. A watershed is a common set of streams and rivers that all drain into a single larger body of water, such as a larger river, a lake, or an ocean . Smaller channels or tributa ries collect runoff from rain and snowmelt and send the water to larger channels and eventually to the main channel which is the lowest body of water in the watershed. As the water runs into the streams and rivers from the surface of a watershed it also f ilters through the soil. These two processes, surface runoff and infiltration are important because they affect water quality. As the water runs off the surface it picks up pollution and deposits the pollution in streams and rivers as it drains the water shed. A flood occurs when a channel receives too much water causing the water to overflow the banks onto the adjacent land. The land and the condition of the land affect what happens to this water: If the terrain is steep more water will run off the land more quickly into streams . If the ground is already saturated from previous rains more water will run off the land into streams and flooding is more likely . If the depression storage areas are filled in with water from previous floods , flooding is more likely. Urbanizing wit h inadequately designed storm water systems during development. Will County Emge rncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 55 Will County Watersheds The County has two principal river basins: the Des Plaines River Basin to the north and west and the Kankakee River Basin to the south and east. Seve ral large tributaries to the Des Plaines River also flow through the County, including the DuPage River and the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. The Des Plaines River flows through the western portion of the County and its watershed covers virtually all of Cook and DuPage Counties and nearly half of Lake County. It has headwater areas in both Wisconsin and Indiana. The drainage area of the Des Plaines River basin within Will County is 478 square miles. The Kankakee River basin area within Will County is 368 square miles. Although the Kankakee River flows throu gh the southwest corner of the C ounty, the majority of the Kankakee River basin in Will County is headwater area composed of numerous smaller streams that drain through Kankakee County before joinin g the Kankakee River. The Kankakee River and the Des Plaines River join to form the Illinois River just outside Will County. For planning purposes, the two basins have been divided into four main watershed planning units. The character of these four water shed planning units varies both in terms of the demographics and the physical conditions. The Des Plaines River, Calumet River, and DuPage River Watersheds have significant urban and suburban components. However, each of these watersheds still has approximately half their land area in agricultural production. Conversely, the Kankakee River Watershed is primarily rural and has over 75% of its land area in agricultural production. There are relatively few lakes in Will County and there is very little data on the lakes that do exist.

The WCSMPC is an advisory body to the Will County Board and is responsible for directing the implementation of Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan and its revision, if necessary. The Stormwater Plan establishes the recommended role of the WCSMPC, which are: Administration and Management: The WCSMPC is composed of half municipal and half County Board representation. The WCSMPC has authority to establish its own committees and to retain engineering, legal, and financial advisors and inspection personnel ; yet, it is planned that County staff will provide these services for the committee as feasible . The committee is required by state statutes to meet, at a minimum, quarterly. Regulation: The WCSMPC is an advisory body to the County Board and is instru mental in developing and maintaining a county- wide ordinance for the County Board and in advising the County Board on issues related to stormwater management in Will County. The committee's recommendations require due consideration and any regulatory enact ments in contravention to the committee's recommendations requires a super majority vote of the County Board. Planning: This is a primary role for the WCSMPC, which is the preparation and maintenance of this plan, the county- wide stormwater ordinance, a nd implementation of the county- wide plan. Maintenance: The Stormwater Management Plan provides authority for the County to ensure maintenance of stormwater facilities and the natural drainage system.

See: http://willcountylanduse.com National Flood Insurance Program For many years, the strategy for reducing flood damages followed a structural approach of building dams and levees and making channel modifications. However, this approa ch did not slow the rising cost of flood damage, and did not provide an affordable opportunity for individuals to purchase insurance to protect them from flood damage. It became apparent that a different approach was needed. The NFIP was instituted in 19 68 to make flood insurance available in communities that have agreed to regulate future floodplain development. As a participant in the NFIP, a community must adopt regulations that: 1) require any new residential construction within the 100- year floodpla in to have the lowest floor, including the basement, elevated above the 100- year flood elevation; 2) require non - residential structures to be elevated or dry flood proofed (the flood proofing must be certified by a registered professional engineer or archi tect); and 3) require anchoring of manufactured homes in flood prone areas. The community must also maintain a record of all lowest floor elevations or the elevations to which buildings in flood hazard areas have been flood proofed. Jurisdiction NFIP# Participation Date Current Effective No Special Flood Hazard Area (All Zone C) M - No Elevation Determined (All Zone A, C & X) Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment Novemb er, 2013 Chapter 4 - 61 In return for adopti ng floodplain management regulations, the federal government makes flood insurance available to the citizens of the community. In 1973, the NFIP was amended to mandate the purchase of flood insurance, as a condition of any loan that is federally regulated, supervised or insured, for construction activities within the 100 -year floodplain. Throughout its 45- year history, the NFIP has provided tens of billions of dollars in claims helping many thousands of home and business owners to recover from the devas tating effects of flooding. As the costs and consequences of flooding increase, it is more important than ever to have access to flood insurance. In 2012, Congress passed the Biggert -Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 (BW -12) to continue and stren gthen the program. BW-12 extends the NFIP for five years, while requiring significant program reform. It requires changes to all major components of the program, including flood insurance, flood hazard mapping, grants, and the management of floodplains. For the NFIP to remain sustainable, its premium structure must reflect the true risks and costs of flooding. This is a primary driver for many of the changes which are designed to make the NFIP more financially stable and ensure that flood insurance rat es more accurately reflect the real risk of flooding. The law calls for the removal of certain subsidies provided to some policyholders and for rates to more accurately reflect risk. Digital Flood Insurance Rate Maps The 1968 National Flood Insurance Act required that flood zones be established to define locations subject to higher probability of flooding. Maps were created that showed the location of the 100-year flood plain, known as Special Hazard Flood Areas (SHFAs).

In the 1980s, digital data began to be used to process and produce the paper FIRMs. GIS came of age in the early 1990s and in 2003, a multi -year billion dollar program called Map Modernization began. This effort is providing reliable digital FIRM data (DFIRMs) to the GIS community and has brought floodplain management into a new age. A Flood Insurance Study of the C ounty prepared by the FEMA was published in January, 1981, pointing out the continuing flooding along the Kankakee River area where yearly ice jams and heavy rains force the Kankakee River to exceed its banks. Since first flood maps, they have been updated multiple times. The last maps for Will County were issued in March of 2003. The Standard DFIRM Database is designed to provide the user with the ability to determine the flood zone, base flood elevation and the floodway status for a particular location. It also has NFIP community information, map panel information, cross section and hydraulic structure information, and base map information like road, stream, and public land survey data. Data locating and characterizing floodplains accurately are vitally important to emergency managers, planners, building inspectors, insurance agencies, and others. D FIRMs have improved the quality of floodplain maps and put information in the hands of people who need it. Over the next 40 years, it has been predicted that the Map Modernization program will save $160 billion. Congress has created a program that directly benefits citizens while mitigating the potential loss of lives and property due to flooding and has also given GIS users in many sectors and Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment Novemb er, 2013 Chapter 4 - 63 industries better quality data that is easier to use. Limited data is available i n Will County for the estimation of structures within the 100- year floodplain. Digital flood data is not available for Will County for incorporation into the County's GIS. DFIRMs for Will County are not expected to be available until 2015.

Riverine flooding is a result of persistent rain and causes a slow rising of water causing it to overflow over several days or weeks. This type of flooding has been previously discussed and is the most typical type of flooding in Will County. Flash floods are a result of torrential rainfall over a short period of time, a sudden release of water from a dam failure, or breakup of an ice jam . These floods occur suddenly with tremendous force. Flash floods can turn calm rivers and streams into a turbulent torrent that is able to carry away boulders, trees, houses, trailers, cars, and people. Flash flooding is a major killer. All flash floods strike quickly and end swiftly. They can be deadly because they produce rapid rises in water levels and have devastating flow velocities. Many flash floods occur a t night when they are difficult to see. Most flash flood deaths are related to vehicles being washed away. People are warned not to attempt driving or walking across a flooded area because as little as two feet of moving water will carry most cars away. Flash floods can occur within several seconds to several hours and with little warning. Several factors can contribute to flash flooding. Among these are rainfall intensity, rainfall duration, surface conditions, and topography and slope of the receiving basin. Most flash flooding is caused by slow -moving thunderstorms in a local area or by heavy rains associated with hurricanes and tropical storms. Although flash flooding occurs often along mountain streams, it is also common in urbanized areas where much of the ground is covered by impervious surfaces. Areas with steep slopes and narrow stream valleys are particularly vulnerable to flash flooding, as are the banks of small tributary streams. In hilly areas, the high -velocity flows and short warning time make flash floods hazardous and very destructive. Flash floods also can be caused by dam failure, the release of ice -jam flooding, or the collapse of a debris dam. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment Novemb er, 2013 Chapter 4 - 65 ICE JAMS Hazard Characteristics Ice jams develop when mild temperatures occur in a location with deep snow cover and totally or partially frozen rivers. The rising water in rivers then breaks the ice layer into large chunks. As these chunks float downriver, they accumulate near obstructions, bridges, and dams. This ice jam then create s a dam across the channel over which the water and ice mixture continues to flow allowing more jamming to occur. Backwater upstream from the ice dam forces the water to overflow, flooding the surrounding area and damaging low -lying areas and municipal st ructures. Flooding moves downstream when the ice dam fails, and the water stored behind the dam is released. At this time, the flood takes on the characteristics of a flash flood, with the added danger of ice flows, that when driven by the energy of the flood -wave, can inflict serious damage on structures. An added danger of being caught in an ice -jam flood is hypothermia, which can kill quickly. The highest percentage of ice jams occur in the month of January, followed by the month of March. There a re generally two types of ice jams: Frazil ice freezes the river and forms a dam. When warm weather and rain break up frozen rivers or any time there is a rapid cycle of freezing and thawing, broken ice floats downriver until it is blocked by an obstructio n such as a bridge or shallow area. Ice jams present three hazards: Sudden flooding of areas upstream from the jam, often on clear days with little or no warning . Sudden flooding of areas downstream when an ice jam breaks. The impact is similar to a da m break, damaging or destroying buildings and structures . Movem ent of ice chunks that can push over trees and crush buildings . Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment Novemb er, 2013 Chapter 4 - 66 History : Flood, Flash Flood, and Ice Jams Will County has always been afflicted by the constant damage and destruction of flooding. Damage caused by the 1974 floods was sufficient to declare the County to be a Presidential disaster area. Once again, a Presidential disaster area would be declared in this area due to the flooding in June, 1981. The DuPage River was declared a St ate Disaster area from the flooding of July, 1983, which included the Will County townships of DuPage, Homer, Lockport, Plainfield, and Troy. Federal disasters were again declared for flooding, including the DuPage River area, occurring in July, 1996; September, 2008; and April, 2013. Mitigation funding of approximately $10.6 million has been spent in Will County from the 1996 and 2008 floods. Severe Storms and Flooding - July 17 to August 7, 1996 Federal Disaster Declaration #1129 Public Assistance - $4,265,671 Individual Assistance - $933,042 (974 referrals) Severe storms and torrential rains began on July 17th and continued intermittently through August 7, 1996. Nearly 17 inches of rain fell in northern Will County on July 17 th and 18th. Flash flooding resulted in widespread power outages, disruption of commuter rail service, and the flooding of thousands of home and hundreds of businesses. Major transportation routes, including interstate highways, city streets, and commuter rail lines were closed du e to the flooding. Damage was widespread throughout Will County with several million of dollars in property damage. Major flooding occurred in the western half of the County in the townships of Lockport, New Lenox, Joliet, Wheatland, DuPage, Homer, Frank fort, Troy, Wilton, Plainfield, Crete, and Channahon. As a result of the Federal declaration, grants and low interest loans were made available to homeowners. Home located along the DuPage River were purchased by the Federal government in Plainfield, Sho rewood, and Channahon. Public assistance helped to rebuild roads and bridges that were destroyed or damaged as a result of the flooding. The Kankakee River downstream of Wilmington is p rone to Ice Jams Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment Novemb er, 2013 Chapter 4 - 67 Severe Storms and Flooding - September 13, 2008 Federal Disaster Declaration #1800 Public Assistance - $667,787 Individual Assistance - $1,438,500 (1,159 referrals) A flood watch was put into effect in the early morning of September 13th and continued into September 15, 2008. A tornado watch also occurred on September 13th Individual Assistance - $4,368,244 (2,385 referrals) . Rainfall amounts varied around the County from 6 to 9 inches with the heaviest amounts occurring in the central and eastern parts of the County. Flooding issues included sewer back -ups, flooded roads, river flooding, and water in basements. Flooding prompted road closures affected approximately 25 arterial streets along with numerous side streets. The DuPage River level rose to 23.86 feet, surpassing the record set in 1996, causing flooding in the Bolingbrook area. Plainfield, Joliet, and Shorewood undertook sandbagging efforts at various locations along the DuPage River with several homes in the Plainfield area evacuated due to rising water. Sporadic instances of motorists becoming trapped attempting to drive through high water occurred. Beecher experienced a partial disruption to its sanita ry sewer system resulting in sewer back- ups in several homes. The Will County EMA website was a source of information for the public on current flood conditions and weather advisories, what to do if their home was flooded, links to river gauges in Will C ounty, and available monetary assistance for flood damaged homes. Along with traditional news media, the County's websites provided an information resource for those seeking assistance available under the Federal and State emergency declarations. Severe S torms and Flooding - April 18, 2013 Federal Disaster Declaration #4116 Public Assistance - $1,238,434 In April, 2013, Will County and other northern Illinois counties experienced a large amount of preci pitation within a short period of time. The rain began on April 17 th and continued into April 19th causing severe flooding throughout the County resulting in damage to roads, businesses, and homes. Rain totals varied from 3\" to almost 7\" across the Count y. Areas along the DuPage River, including western Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment Novemb er, 2013 Chapter 4 - 68 Joliet, Plainfield, and Shorewood generally received the heaviest rainfall amounts. The Kankakee and Des Plaines Rivers did not experience flooding; however all watersheds tributary to those rivers overf lowed. Road closures were experienced in Bolingbrook, Joliet, Naperville, Plainfield, with closures also experienced on state roads and inter -state highways. Limited power outages were experienced. Public safety communications for several fire departme nts in the southwest portion of the County were disrupted due to the flooding of their primary communications tower. Schools were closed in Plainfield, Wilmington, and one elementary school in Joliet. Plainfield temporarily sheltered 12 residents at one of their high schools. Will County hospitals supported Morris Hospital with their evacuation efforts. Thirty- eight counties were declared in a \"state of emergency\" by Governor Quinn with thirty- three counties declared Federal disasters. Mitigation Measur es To address flooding issues within Will County after the 1996 flood, The Will County Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan was developed in 1998. It established the WCSMPC (see p. 4 -59), composed of municipal and County Board members, who was tasked to develop a county -wide Stormwater Management Ordinance. This ordinance has set the minimum standards for flood control issues throughout the County and is adopted and implemented by all municipalities in the County. The WCSMPC identifies flood mitigat ion projects through the recommendations of municipalities, review of available watershed studies, and evaluation of flood incidents. The WCSMPC works with surrounding counties to address flooding issues with watersheds that cross County borders. As an e xample, a list of current and past projects is available from: - http://willcountylanduse.com/stormwater -management -planning- committee/stormwater -projects - http://willcountylanduse.com/sites/default/files/Stormwater%20Project%20List.pdf Many types of flood mitigation measures are available to the WCSMPs and community partners. Some for them to consider are: WCSMPC Projects Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment Novemb er, 2013 Chapter 4 - 69 Maintaining and implementing the Will County Stormwater Management Plan to indentify flooding issues and strategizing methods to address those issues will continue to reduce damages to infrastructure and buildings. Issues to be addressed in the County's watersheds by the WCSMPC include surface flooding, stream maintenance, erosion/sedimentation control, water quality, watershed education, infrastructure maintenance, agency coordination, and property dama ge. The following chart identifies some of the watershed concerns and partner jurisdictions in addressing those concerns. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment Novemb er, 2013 Chapter 4 - 70 Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment Novemb er, 2013 Chapter 4 - 71 Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment Novemb er, 2013 Chapter 4 - 72 Improve WCSMPC planning and project prioritization by conducting watershed studies that provide an analysis of each water shed's function, behavior, physical characteristics, and population/land use distribution. The studies will document the flooding issues in each watershed for development of a flood mitigation project list and provide the WCSMPC with a basis for cost/bene fit analysis, project prioritization, and partner support. The adoption of IBC and IRC building standards (see p. 5- 10 for jurisdictions) and development plans (see p. 5 -9 for jurisdictional plans) have helped to alleviate flooding issues in construction that has occurred post Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) that began to be available in the 1980's. Federal funding after the 1996 and 2008 floods has helped to purchase or retrofit older buildings located in flood plains. A large share of the properties p urchased after the 1996 flood were located along the DuPage River and Jackson Creek. Buyouts after the 2008 were residential in nature and targeted properties located in Plainfield, Channahon, and Crete Townships. Continued Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment Novemb er, 2013 Chapter 4 - 73 buyouts of pre -FIRM structures in special flood hazard areas or retrofitting will help to alleviate issues with repetitive loss properties. Improved technology in monitoring rain and stream gauges allows the NWS and USGS to develop better forecasting models and real -time data that wil l enable government agencies, private institutions, and individuals to make more informed decisions about risk based policies and actions to mitigate the dangers posed by floods. Additionally, improved forecasting and real-time data combined with the latest in communications and alert systems will also mitigate the dangers of floods and help to save lives. Will County Land Use Department and Emergency Management Agency (EMA) continue to partner with the NWX, USGS, and other agencies to improve forecastin g, utilize advanced technology, implement mitigation measures, and maintain planning to ensure the public's safety. Communities within Will County are part of the NFIP by meeting minimum standards. The County and communities could improve flood plain man agement by committing to the NFIP's Community Rating System (CRS) which is a voluntary incentive program that recognizes and encourages community floodplain management activities that exceed the minimum NFIP requirements. Through this program, flood insur ance premium rates would be discounted to reflect the reduced flood risk resulting from meeting the three goals of the CRS: Reduce flood damage to insurable property, strengthen and support the insurance aspects of the NFIP, and encourage a comprehensive approach to floodplain management. Utilize DFIRMS when completed to identify critical facilities located in high flood hazard areas and with GIS to develop and maintain a county- wide database of flood controlled areas, purchased flood plain properties, and flood prone properties to be acquired. Another important mitigation measure is flood risk and mitigation techniques education. Federal and state agencies provide a wealth of information on flood risks and dangers which can be provided to the public in f lood prone areas. Also, it is important to inform the public about the availability of flood insurance. Other education outreach can inform the public about mitigation techniques that they can implement at their homes or businesses. Educational material can be provided to the public through expanding communication technology. Print material can be distributed through traditional methods of brochures, news media, newsletters, or presentations at community events. Websites and the growing social media ar e other educational avenues to reach the public. Smartphone applications (apps) are another effective educational tool. County Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment Novemb er, 2013 Chapter 4 - 74 and communities can continue their public education by adding new and improved communication tools to their outreach efforts.

Flooding raises the water table in wetlands, maintains biodiversity, and replenishes nutrients back into the soil. Additionally, higher water tables allow fish and water plants to re -colonize and may also help to control some invasive species. Flooding, however, becomes a problem in the built envir onment. Drainage systems and city sewers can become overwhelmed, causing raw sewage to back up in basements and onto roadways. Flooding in urban areas can also cause increased runoff, which may carry pollutants through storm sewers into rivers and lakes. Urban runoff can be toxic, as it may contain garbage, fertilizers, oil and other residues from city streets. Riverine flooding has caused displacement, property damage, and impacts on the health of residents. Floods can damage or destroy public and priva te property, disable utilities, make roads and bridges impassable, destroy crops and agricultural lands, cause disruption to emergency services, and result in fatalities. People may be stranded in their homes for several days without power or heat, or the y may be unable to reach their homes at all. Long -term collateral dangers include the outbreak of disease, widespread animal death, broken sewer lines causing water supply pollution, downed power lines, broken gas lines, fires, and the release of hazardou s materials. Flooding is a hazard whose risks are routinely underestimated by the public, who may be inclined to attempt to walk or drive through shallow waters, or to allow their children and pets to play in the water as if it were part of a beach or swim ming pool. Public education is vital so that there is widespread knowledge of the contaminants and germs that floodwaters contain, and a greater awareness of the risks that floodwaters pose to drivers and pedestrians. Drivers need to know that roads and bridges are often weakened and degraded by flood impacts, and that the road they assume is still there under shallow waters may no longer be intact. Floodwaters tend to conceal the presence of open manholes, dangerous debris (such as rusty nails and meta l), and live electrical wires that can cause harmful shocks. Less than a foot of flowing water can cause vehicle s to end up in a ditch or sinkhole, where persons may find it impossible to escape from a submerged vehicle under the pressures exerted by flow ing water. Those who are tempted to walk through floodwaters should be informed that the waters tend to conceal the presence of open manholes and dangerous debris, such as rusty nails and metal, or live electrical wires that can cause harmful shocks. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment Novemb er, 2013 Chapter 4 - 78 Flooding is a major, recurring problem in Illinois. Any buildings in the flood plain are subject to flood damage. Flood damage in Will County results from several different causes. Floods on the Kankakee and Des Plaines Rivers , general ly, are associated wit h spring snowmelt combined with ice jams and frontal rain storms. Flooding is often aggravated by interbasin flow between the Kankakee River and the Des Plaines River, the Kankakee River and Forked Creek, the I and M Canal and the DuPage River, and I and M Canal and Long Run. Floods on much smaller tributaries in Will County are caused by intense thunderstorms which occur in the summer and early fall. New construction near flood plains potentially alters surface water flows by diverting water to new courses or increases the amount of water that runs off impermeable pavement and roof surfaces. This diverts water , if done improperly, to areas previously safe from flooding. Higher risks are associated to areas with increased populations as well as residen tial growth. Per census data, Will County grew in population by 34.9% from 2000 to 2010 to a total of 677,560 people making it one of the fastest growing counties in the U.S. and it continues to grow with an estimated 2012 census total of 682,519. Future plans will continue to keep track of high growth populations and note that they have the potential for higher vulnerability to flooding issues. Impact for Flood: High Damage to Buildings Buildings can be impacted by the velocity of flooding with the force of debris or ice against the exterior damaging the outside walls or pushing the structure off its foundation . Flood waters will deposit sediment and other contaminates. This is a sever e problem when hazardous materials are released into the flood waters. Hydrostatic pressure, the pressure exerted by the water wh en it is at rest, can break walls and floors or even float a structure. Insulation, drywall and other building materials will deteriorate and decompose when wet. Wood will swell from the water and then warp when dried too quickly. Building contents are usually not salvageable after a flood. Any electrical appliances or gas powered engines will be unsafe unless properly dried and cleaned. Will County Flood Loss Estimates (From 2010 IL Haz. Mit. Plan) Total Housing Units 232,007 Median Home Value $154,300 % in Floodplain (Total L and) 11.6 Estimated Damage $830,529,378 Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment Novemb er, 2013 Chapter 4 - 79 Again, wood will warp and split. Upholstered furniture, carpeting, mattresses, and household goods cannot be dried out to useable condition. Dampness, unless mitigated within 24 to 48 hours, will then encourage the growth of mold. Mold spores can germinate and grow in a moist or damp environment, on any surface that contains organic matter. A home that's been flooded can provide ideal conditions for the growth and proliferation of mold. Indoor mold can trigger allergies or allergy -like symptoms affecting the upper respiratory system. Critical Facilities For some activities and facilities, even a slight chance of floo ding is too great a threat. Typical critical facilities include hospitals, fire stations, police stations, storage of critical records, and similar facilities. These facilities should be given special consideration when formulating regulatory alternatives and floodplain management plans. A critical facility should not be located in a floodplain if at all possible. If a critical facility must be located in a floodplain , it should be provided a higher level of protection so that it can continue to function and provide services after the flood. Communities should develop emergency plans to continue to provide these services during the flood. Under Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management, Federal agencies funding and/or permitting critical facilities are required to avoid the 0.2% (500- year) floodplain or protect the facilities to the 0.2% chance flood level. Damage to critical facilities can add to the widespread damage experienced by floods by reducing services they provide to the public . Damage to util ities or pipelines can cause outages. Flooded water or wastewater treatment plants can create serious health hazards. Transportation and communication systems can be limited or shut down. Fires are damaging when areas are inaccessible to fire equipment. Health and Safety It is imperative that people heed warnings during floods. A car will float in less than two feet of moving water sweeping it into deeper waters. Most deaths during floods are a result of people trapped in their vehicles. It is importa nt that people heed travel warnings as road conditions can be easily misjudged. Water on roads can be much deepe r than it appears or sections of road or small bridges can be washed out and the damage not visible. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment Novemb er, 2013 Chapter 4 - 80 Health is affected when drinking water is contaminated with dirt, oil, chemicals, or other debris found in the stormwater runoff. It is important that private wells in flooded areas be tested for contamination and contaminated wells disinfected before resuming well use. As flood waters recede, pools of standing water become a breeding ground for mosquitoes . Wet farm fields negatively impact the planting and harvest seasons and can damage farm equipment. D amp areas of buildings not properly disinfected begin to grow mold or mildew. People may e xperience heart attacks from overexertion or stress. Deaths also occur from electrocution when electrical mechanisms short out and create live current. Floods also have a psychological impact on the people who have lost their home or keepsakes. For those located in floodplain areas, knowledge that their homes could be flooded again causes additional psychological strain. Economic Impact Flood has an economic impact on all residents of the County. P ublic expenditures are expended on flood fighting, sandbags, fire department calls, road closures and repairs, clean -up, and repairs to damaged public property. The public is further impacted when the underfunded NFIP makes payouts for flood claims. The NFIP is meant to be self -supporting, though in 2003 the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that repetitive -loss properties cost the taxpayer about $200 million annually . To cover these costs, the NFIP borrows from the U.S. Treasury when losses are heavy, and these loans are paid back with interes t. After 45 years, flood risks continue and the costs and consequences of flooding are increasing dramatically. As previously discussed, the Biggert - Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 (BW -12) was passed to make the NFIP more sustainable and financially sound. Business losses also occur due to flood damage to the facility structure s and inventory. Customers may not be abl e to reach businesses located in the flood area or raw materials or goods cannot be transported in or out. Additionally, businesses can be impacted by employees who must clean -up their flood damaged homes. Repeated flooding in an area can cause declining property values. In rural areas, flooded fields can mean the loss of the season's crops or food source for livestock. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment Novemb er, 2013 Chapter 4 - 81 Future Occurrence Though flooding can never be eliminated, measures can be taken to lessen the impact of flooding. Among the more not able flood protection measures is the WCSMPC. It is responsible for directing the implementation of Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan and provides the Will County Stormwater Technical Guidance Manual to developers, applicants, and administrators to assist them in complying with the Stormwater Management Ordinance and the technical requirements of a stormwater permit application. The primary purpose of the WCSMPC is to provide county- wide coordination of stormwater management in Will County, to ensur e consistent levels of flood mitigation, and to prevent stormwater related problems throughout the County's watersheds. This provide s for a consolidated county- wide framework. The goals for the Will County Stormwater Program are as follows: 1. Consolidate and coordinate existing stormwater management programs and activities into an effective, unified county -wide structure. 2. Prevent increases in stormwater related problems associated with development, redevelopment and other watershed activities. 3. Remediate existing problems related to improper management of stormwater runoff and encroachment into floodprone areas. 4. Ensure maintenance, management, and sustainable operation of natural and manmade stormwater drainage and storage features. A result of their work is the comprehensive county- wide stormwater ordinance that applies to both incorporated and unincorporated areas. It minimizes any increases in stormwater -related problems and specif ies standards for stormwater drainage and detention, floodp lain management, soil erosion and sediment control, and stream and wetland protection in a single document. To ensure consistency among watershed plans, the committee coordinates watershed projects within the County and with neighboring counties where wat ershed s cross County borders. Since 2009, sixty stormwater projects have been established by the committee . - See: http://willcountylanduse.com/sites/default/fi les/Stormwater%20Project%20List.pdf Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 82 Will County Emgerncy M anagement Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 83 Another flood protective measure has been the increased use of stream gauge moni tors with telemetry that provide real -time information . Stream gauges provide the National Weather Service (NWS), in collaboration w ith many federal, state, and local agencies , with accurate and updated data that improves their river forecasts and warning system for the protection of life and property, and the enhancement of the national economy . NWS data and products form a national information database and infrastructure which can be used by other governmental agencies, the private sector, the public, and the global community.

A sudden motion of the ground that causes surface faulting or ground rupture, ground shaking, and ground failure is the result of an earthquake. The onset of a large earthquake i s initially signaled by a deep rumbling or by disturbed air making a rushing sound. This is shortly followed by a series of violent ground movements. The ground often splits and there can be large, permanent displacements of the earth. Buildings, bridge s, dams, tunnels, and other rigid structures are damaged or collapse when subjected to this stress. In addition to structural problems, water in tanks, ponds, and rivers are frequently displaced. In lakes, an oscillation known as \"seiching\" occurs in w hich the water surges from one end of the lake to the other, causing the water to reach great heights and eventually the lake overflows its banks. Secondary effects are dam failures, fires, floods, and subsidence. Earthquakes can trigger other types of g round failures which could contribute to the damage, such as landslides and liquefaction. In the latter situation, shaking can mix groundwater and soil, liquefying and weakening the ground that supports buildings and severing utility lines. This is a spe cial problem in floodplains where the water table is relatively high and the soils are more susceptible to liquefaction. There are thousands of earthquakes in the U.S. each year, but most are so small in magnitude that they are unable to be felt. Histori cally, the most violent earthquakes have occurred in the central U.S. The old flat-lying, intact bedrock of the central United States behaves as a good \"transmitter\" of the earthquake's energy, and tremors can be felt hundreds of miles away. By contrast, the young, broken up bedrock of the West Coast allows the energy to dissipate quickly, which keeps the effects of the earthquake more localized. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 87 Will County The New Madrid Fault Zone runs from Cairo, Illinois to Memphis, Tennessee. It is the site of the most powerful earthquake ever recorded on this continent. An occurrence in this zone has occurred every 150 to 200 year; thus, it is likely that there will be another major earthquake within the next ten to twenty years. Should an earthquake occur in the New Madrid Fault Zone, Will County would be affected indirectly. The possibility of cracking could occur in plaster and chimneys of older buildings , and transit service would be delayed from the southern portion of the state. The Sandwich Fault Zone is located in t he highly populated northern part of Illinois. It is a narrow belt of high-angle faults that runs from Oregon, Illinois, southeast past Manhattan, Illinois. Knowledge of bedrock geology in this area has been applied in land -use planning. An understanding of the fault zone and associated geologic structures is important in evaluating the potential for underground disposal of waste materials and for underground storage and pipeline transportation of gas and liquid petroleum products. Also, the knowledge c an be used to determine the suitability of sites for construction of major buildings , such as nuclear power plants. Sandwich Fault Zone Map Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 88 Magnitude and intensity are terms used to describe the severity of an earthquake, but they do not mean the same thing. Magnitude is a measure of the seismic energy released from the earthquake. It is calculated from measurements of the ground vibrations recorded by seismographs. Earthquake magnitudes are reported in logarithmic increments. This means that a magnitude 7 earthquake has about 32 times greater energy than a 6 and an increase of 0.2 means twice the energy is released . The Richter Scale is one of several variations of magnitude that are reported, each using a different formula to calculate the magnitude from the recorded vi brations (Bolt, 1993). Earthquakes in Illinois originate within the crust at depths of 1 to 20 km. The vibrations move out away from the point of origin (hypocenter or focus) through the bedrock and then up through the overlying soils on top of the be drock. In the central part of the U.S., the bedrock is flat -lying, old, intact, and strong. Earthquake vibrations travel very far through material such as this in comparison to the young, broken, weak bedrock of the west coast. Because of this difference in bedrock, Central U. S. earthquakes are felt and cause damage over an area 15 to 20 times larger than California earthquakes with similar magnitudes. Intensity is a description of the effects brought about by an earthquake, using the observations of people in the area affected. Intensities are based on descriptive reports, rather than calculated from instrument readings. In general, intensities decrease at greater distances from an epicenter. Intensities are influenced by the soils resting on bedrock. Thick, loose, saturated soils such as in river valleys may amplify earthquake ground motions and thus have higher intensities reported than just outside of the valley. Several formal intensity scales have been proposed for use in different parts of the world. In the U. S., earthquake intensities are reported using the twelve -point Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale Earthquakes in Illinois from 1795 to 2010 Source: 2010 Illinois Hazard Mitigation Plan Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 89 increasing from barely detectable to catastrophic. For any earthquake, there will be multiple intensities, depending on the location of obse rvers - but only one magnitude. History In the United States, the most frequent reports of earthquakes come from the West coast, but the largest earthquakes in the lower 48 states occurred in Missouri in 1811 and 1812 along the New Madrid Faults. The Grea t New Madrid Earthquakes are the benchmarks from which all earthquakes in the Midwest are measured. An important fact is that the earthquakes of 1811 and 1812 were not single events. Rather the earthquakes were a series of over 2,000 shocks in five month s. Six of these quakes were larger than a magnitude of 7 on the Richter Scale and two were near magnitude 8. They totally destroyed the town of New Madrid and caused the land to roll in visible waves. They raised and sank the land as much as 20 feet. The tremors of these earthquakes were no doubt felt throughout all of Illinois, since the quakes are said to have rung church bells in New England. Northern Illinois : Fire at Aurora - One of the largest earthquakes in Illinois occurred in northern Illinois o n May 26, 1909. The exact location of the magnitude 5.1 (estimated) earthquake is not known, but the largest intensities occurred in and near Aurora where many chimneys fell, a stove overturned, gas lines broke, and a fire started. Although considerable excitement ensued, the Aurora fire was quickly extinguished and soon forgotten. It was felt over 500,000 square miles, buildings swayed in Chicago where there was fear that the walls would collapse, houses were jostled out of plumb in Beloit, Wisconsin , and brick walls cracked as far away as Bloomington . A somewhat smaller earthquake occurred nearby in 1912. A magnitude 4.0 earthquake centered in north - central Illinois south of Rockford, near the village of Amboy, woke many Chicago area residents when it Northern Illinois Earthquakes Source: 2010 Illinois Hazard Mitigation Plan Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 90 struck late at night on September 15, 1972. It was felt over a very large area, but the intensity was much smaller than in the 1909 earthquake. Twenty -seven years later on September 2, 1999, a magnitude 3.5 earthquake occurred at nearly the same location as the 1972 earthquake. The greatest intensities were several miles northwest of the epicenter as located by regional seismographs. This same area also experienced a 4.2 magnitude event on June 28, 2004, which was felt in six states. Many of the 364 Illinois earthquakes have very small magnitudes , 2 to 4, that do not cause much damage, but are felt over large areas . Earthquakes occur throughout the state with most in the southern third of the state. Eight percent have occurred in the northern part of the state. Fifteen events have been recorded in Cook, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, and Will Counties since 1804. A 3.8 magnitude earthquake struck on February 10, 2010, about 2 miles northwest of Lily Lake in Kane County. This earthquake was located about 6 miles below the ground surface deep down within the granites.

Larger earthquakes in the New Madrid region have caused more damage in Illinois. The risk of probable damage from future earthquakes can be estimated based on the historical record of past earthquakes. The USGS have created maps for building codes in areas of the largest probable ground shaking that have a low probability of being exceeded over a 50 year period. They have plotted information as numerical values of ground shaking, or accelerations. These values can be converted t o Modified Mercalli Intensities. These USGS maps only show the estimate of shaking on the top of bedrock. Shaking will be modified by the overlying soils. For most of Illinois, the risk is dominated by the possibility of large earthquakes recurring in the New Madrid Seismic Zone, south of Illinois. In this scenario, the maximum accelerations in the southern -most counties of Illinois exceed 60 percent of gravity, or Modified Mercalli Intensity X. Although the risk decreases to the north, there is a 2 % probability during the next 50 years that accelerations greater than 10 percent of gravity, Modified Mercalli Intensity VII, could be exceeded in any of the southern half of Illinois. Because of the current record of minor to moderate earthquakes in nort hern Illinois, occurring west of Chicago, the risk of damaging earthquake motions increases in the western suburbs of Chicago. But if magnitude 4 to 5 earthquakes occur near or South of Chicago, as early events have been located, damage could occur to wea k, old structures through out parts of the city. Earthquakes create numerous risks in people's homes. People can lessen the severity of earthquake damage by identifying hazards that exist in their homes, schools, or places of business and then systematic ally removing or correcting each hazard. This is especially important in the southernmost counties of Illinois where the earthquake risks are the greatest. Some common hazards include: free standing water heaters, stoves, and other gas or electric applia nces which could move or fall during an earthquake; bookshelves or filing cabinets which are free standing or bookshelves with objects stored above head level; water or gas pipes which are not fastened well to walls or ceiling , and large panes of glass whi ch could fracture and fly apart. Some other things that people can do to make their homes more earthquake ready include: keeping a few days supply of food and water available; being sure each home has a fire extinguisher and smoke alarm; Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 92 maintaining a pr operly equipped first aid kit complete with any necessary prescription medication in sufficient quantities to last a few days to a few weeks; organizing and testing a family emergency plan which would help ensure each family member's survival; and having r esidents know how to turn off the gas supply to a building. Should you be involved in an earthquake, remembering a few simple facts can greatly increase your chance of survival and can help to reduce the possibility of serious injury. If inside a buildi ng, stay inside and duck, cover, and hold. Protection inside a building is found next to or under heavy furniture. Do not run outside of a building during the shaking. Falling parts (bricks and glass) of buildings can kill or injure you. Rooms with lots of fixtures (hanging lights within a dropped ceiling) can be dangerous if they fall. Large windows or groups of windows can shatter and shards of glass can fly inward. These areas should be avoided. Large rooms with open -span ceilings or roofs are the most vulnerable to collapse and should be avoided. For over 20 years, IEMA has been involved in the Central United States Earthquake Consortium (CUSEC). During most of these years, an earthquake planner has been employed by IEMA. Part of their duties is to promote earthquake safety awareness. As discussed previously, there are steps individuals can take to make their surroundings more secure during an earthquake which have extensively been promoted. Also, there are earthquake resistant building techniques which can be incorporated into building construction. Unfortunately, the State of Illinois does not have a standard uniform building code. Each jurisdiction adopts and enforces the building code they chose. IEMA has worked to make southern Illinoi s aware of the earthquake risk and encouraged earthquake resistant USGS Earthquake Probability Map Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 93 Typical minor damage (Modified Mercalli Intensity VI to VII) from Lawrenceville, Illinois M 5.0 earthquake. Bricks thrown from Chimney and diagonal masonry cracks in church tower. construction in new buildings. All new schools built with State funds must comply with the 2007 International Building Code. Damage to Buildings Damage to buildings, highways, power lines, pipelines and other structures only partly depend on the amount of energy released during the earthquake. Certain kinds of earth materials resting on the bedrock amplify the earthquake ground motions. In Illinois, structures built on thick, loose sedime nts of river flood plains are more likely to be damaged than structures on glacial till (stiff, pebbly clay) or bedrock. In fact, seismic intensity may increase one or more units on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale, if loose sediments are present. A lso, loose sandy sediments with high moisture content can turn to liquid , quick sand type state - (liquefaction) , when shaken enough. Generally, wood frame buildings and structures on solid ground fare best during an earthquake. Wood frame buildings are f lexible enough to withstand ground shaking and swaying. Evaluations of recent earthquakes found that damage was primarily caused to: Un-reinforced masonry structures Older buildings with some degree of deterioration Buildings without foundation ties Multi- story structures with open or \"soft\" first floors Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 94 At risk in Will County, given the low threat of an earthquake at a Mercalli Intensity of VII or greater, are un -reinforced masonry structures. Most of these structures can be considered to b e historical masonry buildings, built before current building codes. Other areas of potential damage include transportation systems: bridges, pavement cracks or buckles, and misalignment or fissures of rail lines. Utilities could be impacted by downed p ower and communication lines, breaks in water and sanitary sewer lines, and cracking or breaking of natural gas pipelines. Cracks in dams or levees could cause failure. Impact: Guarded Critical Facilities The overall earthquake damage to critical facilities is low. Health and Safety While injury and loss of life are important factors in other parts of Illinois when assessing earthquakes, they are of low concern for Will County. During an earthquake, injuries are expected to be few ; however falling debr is or fires could be a threat . However, should a major earthquake impact southern Illinois, there exists the potential for damage to natural gas pipelines. This would be of greatest concern in the winter in northeastern Illinois. However, the overall impact to health and safely is considered to be low. Economic Impact If any damage was sustained to businesses and infrastructure , the impact of an earthquake would be on the local economy. Public expenditures for repairs to public facilities and clean -up and disposal of Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 95 debris can be high, especially if the structures are not insured for earthquakes. The overall expected economic impact is considered to be low. Future Occurrence The 2013 Illinois Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan rates the earthquake hazard f or Will County as guarded. STATE -WIDE ESTIMATE WITH DEFAULT DATA The Federal Emergency Management Agency sponsored HAZUS (Hazards US) computer loss estimation program comes with default data of building and some infrastructure inventory from various source s including the 2000 census. It uses one type of soil for the entire area. Soils modify the earthquake ground motions that travel through the bedrock and typically amplify the ground motions, increasing shaking at the ground surface as compared to the shaking on the bedrock. The default building inventory contains numbers of structures by construction type per census track and replacement costs for structures are based on an average cost per square foot for 2002. It contains an inventory of essential fa cilities such as: hospitals, medical clinics, schools, fire stations, police stations and emergency operations facilities and high potential loss facilities such as: dams, levees, military installations, nuclear power plants and hazardous material sites. State-Wide Damage for Magnitude 6.3 New Madrid Event HAZUS estimates that 4,453 buildings will sustain at least moderate damage and of those 1,689 will be completely damaged. No essential facilities are expected to be completely damaged and a large percent age will be functional on the day of the event. It is estimated 6,321 households will be without potable water and 3,964 without electricity on the day of the event. Eight of the 22,854 bridges in Illinois are expected to be completely damaged along with two ferry facilities. Debris generated is estimated to be 219,000 tons. Displaced households are 1,882 with 556 requiring shelter. There are 540 casualties and a total direct economic impact of about $920 million. State -Wide Damage for Magnitude 7.7 New Madrid Event HAZUS estimates that 75,272 buildings will sustain at least moderate damage and of those 19,044 will be completely damaged. Forty -two essential facilities are expected to be completely Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 96 damaged including two hospitals and many facilities w ill need a few days to a month to recover to functionality. It is estimated 100,483 households will be without potable water and 25,191 without electricity on the day of the event. Sixty -two of the 22,854 bridges in Illinois are expected to be completely damaged along with two ferry facilities and one airport. Debris generated is estimated to be 3,377,000 tons. Displaced households are 22,468 with 6,556 requiring shelter. There are 7,629 casualties and a total direct economic impact of about $9 billion. Probability Map based on Magnitude 5.0 Will County Area Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 97 DROUGHT Hazard Characterization The basic cause of drought in Will County and the surrounding counties is a prolonged deficiency of rainfall that can happen any time of the year. The effects of the drought vary in diffe rent areas due to such factors as unequal distribution of rainfall, differences in topography and soil, the erratic distribution of drainage features, and the continuing change in the underlying bedrock geology throughout Will County. In certain locations , man's erratic development, alteration, and misuse of natural resources will significantly affect the severity of the drought. Drought devastates crops resulting in low yields and economic losses. Winds blow away topsoil and create dust storms further e roding farm land. Water tables are lowered. Forests and grasslands are susceptible to fire. A drought is defined as the cumulative deficit of precipitation relative to what is normal for a region over an extended period of time. Unlike other natural haz ards, a drought is a non -event that evolves as a prolonged dry spell. Droughts occur when a long period passes without substantial rainfall. A heat wave combined with a drought is a very dangerous situation. When a drought begins or ends may be difficul t to determine. A drought can be short, lasting just a few months, or persist for years before climatic conditions return to normal. There are four commonly used operational definitions: Meteorological Drought : A period of well -below -average precipitati on that spans from a few months to a few years. Agricultural Drought: A period when soil moisture is inadequate to meet the demands for crops to initiate and sustain plant growth. Hydrological Drought: A period of below -average streamflow and/or de pleted reservoir storage (i.e., streamflow, reservoir and lake levels, ground water). Economic Drought: This definition deals with the supply and demand of water. Some years there is an ample suppl y of water and in other years there is not en ough to meet human and environmental needs. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 98 While drought conditions can occur at any time throughout the year, the most apparent time is during the summer months. High temperatures, prolonged high winds, and low relative humidity can aggravate drought c onditions. Because the impacts of a drought accumulate slowly at first, a drought may not be recognized until it has become well established. The many aspects of drought reflect its varied impacts on people and the environment. While the impacts of prec ipitation deficit may be extensive, it is the deficit, not the impacts, that defines a meteorological drought. Primary Effects Crop failure is the most apparent effect of drought in that it has a direct impact on the economy and, in many cases, health (n utrition) of the population that is affected by it. Due to a lack of water and moisture in the soil, many crops will not produce normally or efficiently and, in many cases, may be lost entirely. Water shortage is a very serious effect of drought in that t he availability of potable water is severely decreased when drought conditions persist. Springs, wells, streams, and reservoirs have been known to run dry due to the decrease in ground water, and, in extreme cases, navigable rivers have become unsafe for navigation as a result of drought. Secondary Effects Fire susceptibility is increased with the absence of moisture associated with a drought. Dry conditions have been known to promote the occurrence of widespread wildfires. Tertiary Effects Environmental degradation in the forms of erosion and ecological damage can be seen in cases of drought. As moisture in topsoil decreases and the ground becomes dryer, the susceptibility to windblown erosion increases. In prolonged drought situations, forest root systems can be damaged and/or destroyed resulting in loss of habitat for certain species. In addition, prolonged drought conditions may result in loss of food sources for certain species. In prolonged drought situations the soil surrounding structures subsides, sometimes creating cracks in foundations and separation of foundations from above ground portions of the structure. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 99 The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) is an attempt to compare weekly temperature and precipitation readings over a defined climatic region in order to identify periods of abnormally dry (or wet) weather. These PDSI readings reflect the relative disparity between moisture supply (precipitation and soil moisture) and demand (evapotranspiration, soil recharge and runoff needs) for a par ticular region based upon what is considered normal for the area. The index is used to evaluate scope, severity, and duration of abnormal weather. Based on the PDSI, the State's Hazard Mitigation Plan designates Will County as having a \"guarded\" hazard l evel for drought. Southern Illinois is generally more vulnerable to drought due having to soils that hold less water. The PDSI is an important climatological tool for evaluating the scope, severity, and frequency of prolonged periods of abnormally dry or wet weather. It can be used to help delineate disaster areas and indicate the availability of irrigation water supplies, reservoir levels, range conditions, amount of stock water, and potential intensity of forest fires. Droughts occur when a long period passes without substantial rainfall. A prolonged drought, such as the drought that remained in the Midwest from 1987 to 1991, can have a serious economic impact on a community. Increased demand for water and electricity may result in shortages of resourc es. Moreover, food shortages may occur if agricultural production is damaged or destroyed by a loss of crops or livestock. The 2004 Illinois Hazard Mitigation Plan estimated that the frequency of droughts in the state \"occurs about once every 21 years.\" Extreme heat events have occurred more frequently in Will County. A 15 year overall recurrence for extreme heat and drought is used (annual recurrence of 0.067). History One-month precipitation deficits on a statewide or regional basis do not usually cons titute droughts, although there may be significant impacts on agriculture depending on the time in the growing season and Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 100 on soil moisture conditions. Agricultural and hydrologic droughts have different lag times in relation to the timing of precipitation , and their intensities do not correlate exactly with one another. Agricultural droughts typically trigger the availability of several USDA emergency assistance programs from the Farmers Home Administration (loans), Agricultural Stabilization and conservat ion Service (disaster assistance payments), Natural Resource Conservation Service (formerly SCS, for technical assistance), and Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (loss claims). In September 1983, all 102 counties were proclaimed State disaster areas beca use of high temperatures and insufficient precipitation beginning in mid -June. More recently in 1988, 54 percent of the State was impacted by drought -like conditions, resulting in disaster relief payments to landowners and farmers exceeding $382 million, but no State proclamations. The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) is an attempt to compare weekly temperature and precipitation readings over a defined climatic region in order to identify periods of abnormally dry (or wet) weather. These PDSI readings reflect the relative disparity between moisture supply (precipitation and soil moisture) and demand (evapotranspiration, soil recharge and runoff needs) for a particular region based upon what is considered normal for the area. The index is used to evaluate scope, severity, and duration of abnormal weather. Both the timing and amount of precipitation are responsible for the occurrence of a drought. The mean annual precipitation in Illinois varies from 34 inches in Northern Illinois to 46 inches in the So uth. Annual amounts fluctuate primarily within a 10- inch range of the median. The most severe drought in recent years was 1988, when rainfall was 88 percent of normal. The timing or distribution was also abnormal because 1988 saw less than 50 percent of the April through August normal rainfall. Droughts of this magnitude occur about once every 21 years. A smaller drought occurred in the northern two -thirds of the State (NWS zones 1 -10). Although it only lasted through the month of May 1992, Chicago, Moline and Rockford recorded the driest May on record, and Springfield and Peoria their second driest. Precipitation of less than 88 percent of normal also occurred in all of Illinois in September of 1994, Northwestern Illinois in December of 1994, the northern half of the State in February of 1995, all of the Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 101 Will County State in March, and the northern half again in June of 1995. However, even though precipitation values were below average, none of these were considered drought -like conditions officially. Precipitation values from 54 to 65 percent of normal for the months of February and April of 1996, in northwest and central portions of the State would technically put those areas into the 3 -month or 6 -month precipitation drought categories. However, above average precipitation in May reversed all drought impacts. A severe drought struck Illinois in 2005-06, especially in the northern half of the State. Dry conditions in 2005 reached a historic level of severity in some parts of Illinois and ranked as one of the t hree most severe droughts in Illinois in 112 years of records . The timing of the dryness during the spring and summer, when water demand and use are high, ensured substantial impacts on agriculture and other sectors. The drought also had several unusual characteristics. The drought area was long and narrow, extending from south Texas to the Great Lakes . But within the Midwest, the drou ght had relatively minor impact on states other than Illinois. A record number of remnants of hurricanes and tropical s torms passed through Illinois during July, August and September, substantially ameliorating drought conditions in portions of central and southern Illinois. Crop yields were surprisingly high in parts of the State, perhaps providing evidence of increased drought resistance in modern varieties and the benefits of timely rains. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 102 Risk Characterization All areas in the United States are at risk of drought at any time of the year. The following paragraph was provided by Jim Angel, State Climatologist at the Illinois State Water Survey, to explain the Illinois Hazard Rating Drought Map. \"One of the obstacles to an objective and reasoned reaction to drought in Illinoi s is uncertainty over its definition. One way of measuring drought is through the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), which takes into account both temperature and precipitation in determining the severity of drought. Historically, the 1930s and 1950s were periods when drought was most frequent and troublesome in Illinois. More recently, the 1988 drought was severe but short -lived, lasting from June to October of that year. Based on the PDSI, the risk of drought has historically been evenly distribute d across the State. This is not surprising since drought is partially the result of changes in the large -scale circulation patterns of the atmosphere, for example, the location of a high - pressure dome over the Midwest in summer. Historically, moderate to severe drought occurs about 17% of the time in Illinois. However, Southern Illinois is generally more vulnerable to drought due to soils that hold less water and water supplies that are more likely to rely on shallow groundwater and surface water. \" Impac t: Moderate Damage to Buildings Heat and drought have little or no impact on structures. The impact on buildings is low. Since impact is low, the vulnerability of extreme heat and drought has not been calculated. Critical Facilities Extreme heat and d rought can have an impact on water supply. The demand on electric utilities is elevated. The impact of extreme heat and drought to critical facilities is low. Health and Safety Will County, like most areas of the Midwest, is very vulnerable to extreme heat. Stagnant atmospheric (humid and muggy) conditions and poor air quality can induce heat -related illnesses. IMPACT OF DROUGHT EVENTS ON WILL COUNTY (Source: National Climatic Data Center / WC EMA) September, 1998 August, 1999 September, 1999 October, 1999 November, 1999 Decemb er, 1999 August, 2002 September, 2002 June, 2005 July, 2005 August, 2005 September, 2005 October, 2005 November, 2005 December, 2005 January, 2006 February, 2006 Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 103 Urban areas are exposed more acutely to the dangers of extreme heat due to heat being retained in asphalt and concrete and being released at night. In addition to air quality, concrete and asphalt store heat longer and gradually release the heat at night which produces higher nighttime temperatures , allowing little relief. Young children; the elderly; those who are sick, overweight or have a lcohol problems ; and men in general (because they sweat more and become more quickly dehydrated) are more susceptible to extreme heat. Usually the victims have been overexposed to heat or have over -exercised for their age and physical condition. People a re at risk for heat stroke or sun stroke, heat exhaustion, and dehydration. Impact on people is high. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 104 Economic Impact A heat wave combined with a drought creates a very dangerous environment. Also, a prolonged drought, such as the drought that plag ued the Midwest from 1987 to 1991, can have a serious economic impact on a community. Increased demand for water and electricity may result in shortages of resources. Both of these can be supplied in the municipalities with no economic disruption. In rural areas and villages where water is drawn from shallow wells, rationing or lawn watering bans may be needed. Moreover, food shortages may occur if agricultural production is damaged or destroyed by a loss of crops or livestock. There are no available figures on the cost of drought or heat to Will County. The 1988 drought/heat wave resulted in $382 million in disaster relief payments to landowners and farmers throughout the state. While not the major industry as in the past , agriculture is still impo rtant to the County's economy. A severe drought would have a ripple effect on other sectors, especially in the rural areas. Future Occurrences The 2013 Illinois Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan rates Will County's future risk of drought as guarded . DROUGHT Type Number of Occurrences Since 1993 Annual Mean Drought 9 .06 Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 105 EXTREME HEAT Hazard Characterization Extreme heat for a region is temperatures that hover 10 degrees or more above the average high temperature for several days to several weeks. The definitions do vary by region; however, a heat wave is usually defined as a period of a t least three consecutive days above 90 degrees. Humid or muggy conditions, which add to the discomfort of high temperatures, occur when a \"dome \" of high atmospheric pressure traps hazy, damp air near the ground. Excessively dry and hot conditions can pr ovoke dust storms and low visibility. Prolonged periods of extreme heat and humidity have a deleterious effect on a community, particularly the elderly and those who cannot afford cooling capabilities. The National Weather Service (NWS) has devised the \"h eat index\" to describe how hot it feels when temperature and humidity are combined. When the temperature is above 90\u00ba F and humidity is high, the body is under great stress to regulate the body's normal temperature. Heat waves can cause heatstroke, a me dical emergency, and heat exhaustion. Heatstroke causes high body temperatures and the victim may become delirious, stuporous, or comatose. Heat exhaustion is less severe but can cause dizziness, weakness, and fatigue. It is typically the result of fluid imbalance caused by increased perspiration. Extreme EXTREME HEAT TERMS Heat Advisory Issued within 12 hours of the onset of the following conditions: heat index of at least 105\u00b0F but less than 115\u00b0F for less than 3 hours per day, or nighttime lows above 80\u00b0F for 2 consecutive days. Heat Wave Prolonged period of excessive heat often combined with excessive humidity. Heat Index A number in degrees Fahrenheit (F) that tells how hot it feels when relative humidity is added to the air temperature. Exposure to full sunshine can increase the heat index by 15 degrees. Heat Cramps Muscular pains and spasms due to heavy exertion. Although heat cramps are the least severe of heat related medical problems, they are often the first signal that the body is having trouble with the heat Heat Exhaustion Typically occurs when people exercise heavily or work in a hot, humid place where body fluids are lost through heavy sweating. Blood flow to the skin increases, caus ing blood flow to decrease to the vital organs. This results in a form of mild shock. If not treated, the victim's condition will worsen. Body temperature will keep rising and the victim may suffer heat stroke. Heat or Sun Stroke Heat stroke is life -threatening. The victim's temperature control system, which produces sweating to cool the body, stops working. The body temperature can rise so high that brain damage and death may result if the body is not cooled quickly. Source: Are You Ready?, FEMA, H -34/September, 2002 Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 106 heat can also cause heat syncope, a loss of consciousness, and heat cramps, all brought on by over exercise. Stagnant atmospheric (humid and muggy) conditions and poor air quality can induce heat -related illnesses. Heatstroke and heat exhaustion are more intense in urban areas. Other effects of extreme heat are water shortages, fire hazards, excessive demands for energy, damaged crops, a nd danger to livestock. Roads, bridges, railroad tracks, and other infrastructure can also be damaged by the thermal expansion caused by extreme heat. The NWS offices with responsibility for counties in the State of Illinois will initiate alert procedur es to warn people of the impending danger due to excessive heat. When the heat index is forecast to exceed 105 - 110 degrees for at least two consecutive days, NWS procedures are: Heat Index values will be included in all NWS forecasts \"Hazardous Weather Outlook\" products will highlight any threat of excessive heat for the following 1 to 7 day period \"Excessive Heat Warning\" products will present a detailed discussion of: The extent and expected duration of the hazard, including forecast temperatures and heat index values Who is most at risk Safety rules for reducing the risk State and local health officials will assist in preparing emergency messages prior to and during excessive heat events. Meteorological information from \"Excessive Heat Warnings\" will be included, as well as more detailed medical information, advice, and names and telephone numbers of health officials HEAT INDEX / HEAT DISORDERS Heat Index Possible Heat Disorders for People in Higher Risk Gr oups 130\u00b0 or Higher Heat stroke/sun stroke, highly likely with continued exposure . 106\u00b0 - 130\u00b0 Sun stroke/heat cramps or heat exhaustion likely, and heat stroke possible with prolonged exposure and/or physical activity. 90\u00b0 - 108\u00b0 Sun stroke, heat cram ps and heat exhaustion possible with prolonged exposure and/or physical activity. 80\u00b0 - 90\u00b0 Fatigue possible with prolonged exposure and/or physical activity.

History Severe heat waves have caused catastrophic crop failures, thousands of deaths and widespread power outages due to increased use of air conditioning. The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) has provided information on heat related deaths. Iden tifying the exact number of deaths due to heat is very difficult. Usually heat is not the primary cause listed on the death certificate but an \"underlying cause\". The heat waves of the summer of 1995 caused deaths and injuries previously unseen in the State of Illinois. Throughout the ent ire State, the combination of record or near record high temperatures and high dewpoint temperatures led to heat indices routinely above the 120- degree mark from July 12 -17. The heat index peaked at 125 degrees on July 14 when the air temperature was 98 degrees and the relative humidity was 63 degrees. An approach used by IDPH to identify heat as being responsible for deaths is to look at \"excess deaths\". In 1995, there were roughly 600- 700 excess deaths. IDPH identifies heat as a contributor to the de ath of 600 to 700 people. These figures are slightly higher for 1995 than other figures identified in this section. All of the sources have documented that excessive heat can contribute to death. Conditions such as these create hardships for respiratory and cardiovascular systems of every person, but especially in toddlers and the elderly. The human body is very capable of handling extreme temperatures; however, when high humidity accompanies these conditions, it is often too much for the body to handle (the same is true for the human body with cold temperatures when combined with strong winds, producing dangerous wind chills). Scattered power outages compounded the problem when Commonwealth Edison, the supplier of electricity to virtually the entire C hicago metropolitan area, and other electric IMPACT OF HEAT EVENTS ON WILL COUNTY (Source: National Climatic Data Center / WC EMA) July 12, 1995 June 25, 1997 June 22, 2009 July 21, 1999 July 28, 1999 August 16, 1999 May 23, 2010 May 30, 2011 July 4, 2012 July 19, 20 13 HEAT RELATED DEATHS in ILLINOIS 1990 -2007 YEAR # of DEATHS 1990 7 1991 10 1992 1 1993 12 1994 11 1995 152 1996 10 1997 12 1998 12 1999 174 2000 11 2001 19 2002 22 2003 5 2004 3 2005 10 2006 17 2007 8 Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 108 utilities could not keep up with the record demand. Of the 583 fatalities associated with the 1995 heat waves, 75 death certificates listed heat as the primary cause, and 508 as the secondary cause. In a sampl ing of 134 of the heat victims, 61% were over the age of 65, but only 2 of the 134 fatalities (1.5%) were toddlers. Five -hundred four of the deaths were in Chicago. At the time there was a perception that the numbers were inflated, later studies indicate d the opposite was true and the heat victims were significantly undercounted. Local officials believed that many of the elderly were scared to come out of their apartments because of high amounts of crime in their neighborhoods. Many were found in their rooms with air temperatures in excess of 120 degrees. The City of Chicago has taken a number of steps to mitigate the health hazards in the event of future heat waves, including a program for home visits to check the condition of people indicated as vulne rable. In 1999, the entire Midwest was above normal in temperature for the month of July, with the last ten days consisting of a major heat wave. As a ten -day average, both maximum and minimum temperatures were 7 to 11 degrees above normal. The peak of the heat struck on July 29th and 30 th Chicago had previously experienced deadly heat waves in 1955 when \"large numbers of deaths\" occurred and in 1916 with 535 deaths. In the 1990's , two significant heat waves impac ted Chicago. In the 1995 heat wave, the number of estimated fatalities varies, but most sources agree that the number exceeded 700. Then in 1999, Chicago in most of the Midwest. Minimums exceeded 78 degrees in cities like Chicago, St. Louis and Cincinnati, where many heat related deaths occurred. The maximum temperature exceeded 100 degrees in many of these same citie s, with most of the Midwest recording maximums 10 to 20 degrees above normal. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 109 experienced another heat wave that closely matched the 1995 event, but the death toll was reduced to approximately 100 people. A paper written by Michael Palace and Stanley Chignon, of the State Water Survey, attribute much of the reduction in deaths to mitigation efforts. The efforts included education by the news media and care monitoring procedures for the urban elderly. The September 2005, Chicago All - Hazard Risk Assessment also states the 1999 deaths were lower than 1995 and believed to be the result of the implementation of Chicago's Extreme Weather Operations Plan. Risk Characterization The New York Times article dated August 13, 2002, \"Most Deadly of the Natural Disasters: The Heat Wave\" states that heat waves kill more people in the United States than all other natural disasters combined.\" The article goes on to state that a University of Del aware study indicated that 1,500 American city dwellers die each year because of heat compared with 200 from tornadoes, earthquakes and floods combined. This natural disaster has long been overlooked because there is not visible damage like in a tornado and its impact is greatly understated in terms of human toll because not all heat related deaths are recorded. The current mitigation planning process encourages the State to look at such factors as urbanization, the elderly , and low income. It is imposs ible to ignore these factors when analyzing heat waves. According to historical discussion and the above referenced article, when the Chicago heat wave of July 1995, occurred \"the poor, the old, residents of abandoned and violent neighborhoods who lived a lone, lacked access to transportation and lacked air -conditioning\" were the victims. The time we have until the next heat wave is unknown, but all of the major reports on global warming indicate that an increase in severe heat waves is likely. Chicago is one of the State's most vulnerable areas because of their size and population . Their Risk Assessment predicts 17.8 days a year where temperatures breach the 90 degree mark. Articles all agree that summer heat kills more people than other natural hazards. The National Weather Service (NWS) indicates that in a normal year the number will be 175 Americans. Other sources project the number of deaths to be much higher each year. So not only do we not know when heat waves will strike, we do not have a firm es timate on the number of people who will be impacted. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 110 Impact: Moderate Damage to Buildings Heat and drought have little or no impact on structures. Critical Facilities Extreme heat and drought can have an impact on water supply. The demand on electric utilities is elevated. Health and Safety Heat kills by pushing the human body beyond its limits. Under normal conditions, the body's internal thermostat produces perspiration that evaporates and cools the body. However, in extreme heat and high humidity, evaporation is slowed and the body must work extra hard to maintain a normal temperature. Most heat disorders occur because the victim has been overexposed to heat or has over exercised for his or her age and physical condition. Other conditions that can induce heat -related illnesses include stagnant atmospheric conditions and poor air quality. Extreme heat events can be just as deadly as other natural hazards due to the nature of the event. Extreme heat doesn't immediately impact people when it sets in, instead it is when the periods of extreme heat last for days and weeks that it takes its toll on people. The elderly are at particular risk. Economic Impact Generally, extreme heat impacts agricultural areas in the State. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 111 Future Occurrence Extreme heat events do not have a specific area or size that is usually associated with them. Therefore, all areas located within Will County have a probability of being affected by one or more extreme heat events. The 2013 Illinois Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan rates the extreme heat hazard for Will County as guarded . HEAT/EXCE SSIVE HEAT PROBABILITY Type Number of Occurrences Since 199 5 Annual Mean Heat / Excessive Heat 10 .55 Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 112 INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURE Hazard Characterization Infrastructure failure o f critical public or private utilities results in a temporary l oss of essential functions and/or services. The residents of Will County depend on the public and private utility infrastructure to provide essential services such as electric power, heating a nd air conditioning, water, sewage disposal and treatment, storm drainage, communications, and transportation. Failure of any of these services for an extended length of time would require an emergency management organization response to supply food, water, heating, etc. Failure can occur within a distribution system or be caused by external factors such as severe storms or fire. Codes and standards govern the design, construction, and operation of infrastructures, but they are inadequate to protect agai nst disaster related damage. Electricity failure interrupts the functions of businesses and homes, causes life -threatening situations in medical facilities, creates traffic stoppages, spoils food, and disrupts communication and computer functions. Failure of heating and air conditioning units can threaten lives in extreme cold or hot weather. Disruption of storm drainage can lead to flooding, and inoperable sewage treatment facilities will cause pollution leading to serious public health problems. Infras tructure failure heavily impacts the most vulnerable members of the community, namely the elderly, children, impoverished individuals, and people in poor health. The cost to repair these systems along with the economic and societal damage caused by length y disruption is excessively high. History Utility interruptions have been rare in Will County other than those associated with weather events. Risk Characterization Infrastructure failure may result from natural, technological, or societal hazards along wi th human error, equipment failure, or poor maintenance. The impact of infrastructure failure can be significant depending on the length of disruption and the extent of the affected area. Infrastructure failures can also create serious safety hazards when power lines are down, fire or explosion ensues, or hazardous materials are released into the environment. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 113 Natural hazards include tornadoes and severe thunder or winter storms that may damage utility supply lines. Extreme heat can place a high demand fo r electricity causing an over -demand and failure of power grids. Drought can impact water supplies. Technological hazards can impact infrastructure through fire, pipeline damage, or industrial accidents. Societal hazards include intentional acts of disr uption resulting from terrorist attacks, civil disturbances, or sabotage. Disruptions Electric Utility: Affects the population primarily during winter and summer when the need and demand for heat and air -conditioning are high. Electric disruptions impa ct business when computers, lighting, refrigeration, gas pumps, and other equipment cannot be powered. Telecommunications: Society has become very dependent on our variety of communication devices. When telephone service is disrupted, the use of land or cell phones, internet, or credit cards may be impacted. This can have a negative affect on emergency services and the banking system. Usage overloads of cell phones occur when there are large public events or emergencies. Storms may have an affect on r adio communications. With many forms of communication devices available to us, the unavailability of one type should not affect the use of others. Water Supply: Severe drought can have an impact on water supply causing restrictions on use. Wastewater Services: Damage to wastewater facilities may cause sanitation and biological hazards, overloading of systems causing overflows and pollution, sewage discharge, and economic loss due to cleanup costs. Gas Supply: Damage to gas supply systems ca n cause fire, ex plosion, death, evacuation of affected areas, loss of heat and cooking facilities, and economic losses to business and industry. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 114 Petroleum Distribution: Loss of petroleum supply and distribution networks can result in fire, explosions, death, panic buying of fuel, social disruption, environmental cleanup costs, and economic losses to business and industry. Transportation Systems: Infrastructure losses would cause the loss of traffic signals and damage to roadways, bridges, or waterways due to fire or exp losion resulting in traffic congestion, social disorder, and economic losses. Impact: High Damage to Buildings Damage to buildings due to infrastructure failure is low. The potential exists for water damage when a facility is without heat and pipes free ze causing them to burst. Fire is another hazard when people find alternate sources for heat or light when electricity or heating fuel is disrupted. Explosion can occur from damaged gas lines. Health and Safety Impact on people and pets occurs when heati ng and cooling sources are lost. With extreme cold and heat events, the elderly are generally the first population group to be adversely affected. Injury or death may be possible when fire, explosions, or gas leaks occur. Economic Impact A study characte rizing infrastructure failure interdependencies identified the sectors affected as: HVAC in buildings, effects on water systems, effects on health systems, and effects on road transportation systems. If disrupted by infrastructure failure, all of the sect ors could have a significant impact on businesses and homes in the affected area. Future Occurrence Infrastructure failure may occur individually or in combination with natural or technological hazards. It is estimated that the probability of occurrence a nd effect is low; however, the potential exi sts for widespread effect, particularly as secondary effects from hazards such as tornadoes. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 115 HAZARDOUS MATERIAL - FIXED SITE and TRANSPORTATION Hazard Characterization Will County has many oil refineries, chem ical manufacturers, and other businesses that use hazardous materials in their processing. A dozen facilities are listed on the State Hazardous Sites list. Over three hundred facilities are Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulated and are required to report to the EPA the storage and releases of specific chemicals. This reporting system is guided by the Emergency Planning and Right to Know Act (EPCRA) of 1986 and provides information for hazardous and toxic chemicals. EPCRA establishes requirem ents for federal, state and local governments, Indian tribes, and industry regarding emergency planning and \"Community Right -to-Know\" reporting on hazardous and toxic chemicals. The Community Right -to-Know provisions help increase public's knowledge and a ccess to information on chemicals at individual facilities, their uses, and releases into the environment. States and communities, working with facilities, can use the information to improve chemical safety and protect public health and the environment. EPCRA has four major provisions: Emergency planning (sections 301- 303) Emergency release notification (section 304) Hazardous chemical storage reporting requirements (sections 311-312) Toxic chemical release inventory (section 313) Releases of hazardous or toxic chemicals must be reported which include emission of gases, wastewater releases into rivers and other bodies of water, solid waste disposal in landfills, injection of wastes into underground wells, transfer of wastewaters to public sewage plants, and transfer of wastes to off -site facilities for treatment or storage. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 116 EPCRA CHEMICALS AND REPORTING THRESHOLDS Chemical Covered Section 302 355 Extremely Hazardous Substances Section 304 >1,000 substances Sections 311/312 Approximately 500,000 hazardous chemicals Section 313 > 650 Toxic Chemicals and categories Thresholds Threshold Planning Quantity1 -10,000 pounds on site at any one time Reportable quantity, 1-5,000 pounds, released in a 24 -hour period 500 pounds or TPQ whichever i s less for EHSs; 75,000 gallons for gasoline; 100,000 gallons for diesel and 10,000 pounds for all other hazardous chemicals 25,000 pounds per year manufactured or processed; 10,000 pounds a year otherwise used; persistent bio - accumulative toxics have lower thresholds The chemicals and materials that these facilities use have a wide range of toxicity. A small release of many of these chemicals may have little effect on the surrounding environment; however, the release of some chemicals or radioactiv e materials could have long lasting affects on the environment and injure or kill many people in the affected area. The hazard from these chemicals can be explosive, flammable, combustible, corrosive, reactive, poisonous, toxic, a biological agent, or rad ioactive. Hazardous materials can be spilled or released during the manufacturing or refining process or they can be spilled during transportation to or from these facilities as raw elements or processed goods. Radioactive materials are included with nuc lear sites located in Braidwood and nearby Grundy County. Thousands of hazardous materials are shipped on a daily basis through the County's local communities by all modes of transportation. With the intermodal systems in place in Will County, hazardous chemicals are transported by rail, highway, pipeline, and waterway on a daily basis. An accident within any of these transportation systems could cause an emergency affecting many people. Hazardous materials include corrosives, flammables, toxic materia ls, radioactive substances, explosives, dangerous gases, and poisons. Accidents can affect the immediate vicinity of the accident site or spread to involve a portion of the surrounding community. These types of accidents can usually be handled effectivel y by local emergency services. Large -scale accidents that involve a widespread release of a toxic substance can have severe implications for the surrounding environment and population. Statistically, most hazardous material accidents are caused by some t ype of human error and rarely by mechanical failure of the facility or carrying vessel. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 117 History Numerous spills have occurred along the County's highway and railway systems. Most involve the spill of diesel fuel, but others have involved corrosive and fla mmable liquids. On December 12, 2004, two - thousand gallons of diesel fuel were spilled in Joliet along the BNSF railroad. A spill on July 19, 2001, involved 13,000 gallons of Nalkylene 540 L detergent Alkylate on the Des Plaines River near Channahon. On July 2, 1999, 12,000 lb. of an oil/water mix was dispersed near Channahon affecting 7,500 people, 2,500 homes, and area crops. Risk Characterization Hazardous materia l incidents are intentional and/or unintentional releases of a hazardous material. Each incident's impact and resulting response depends on many variables that include the quantity and specific characteristics of the material, the conditions of the release, the weather conditions in the area of the release, and the ar ea/population centers involved. The effects of the spill could be limited to the incident site or quickly spread by wind or water for many miles. HAZMAT site control and clean- up is a highly technical and expensive process requiring specialized training and equipment. Local fire districts have some limited ability to deal with hazardous material, but area chemical facilities and the Will County EMA also have HAZMAT teams who are specially trained to deal with such incidents. Will County has a diverse mi x of manufacturing and agricultural entities. Both types of entities deal with chemicals that can have hazardous effects. In addition, the agricultural economy can be affected when hazardous chemicals are dispersed by the wind over farm fields or livesto ck. Spills and releases are usually random, but are minimized with regular inspections and maintenance, good housekeeping, IMPACT OF HAZARDOUS MATERIAL - FIXED SITE & TRANSPORTATION EVENTS IN WILL COUNTY (Source: National Response Center) Number of Incidents from 1990 to 2013 Fixed Site Pipeline Vehicle Railroad Railroad - No Release Storage Tank Vessel Unknown Source 946 82 98 57 58 66 96 160 Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 118 effective emergency p lans, readily available fire suppression equipment, proper warning labels, the use of appropriate containers an d storage, and training in proper safety and handling procedures. Impact: High Damage to Buildings Damage can result from contamination, but in most cases damage or destruction occurs from fire or explosion. Critical Facilities Critical infrastructures ca n be damaged or destroyed by fire or explosion. Water supplies can be contaminated when hazardous chemicals enter the water system. Health and Safety Health problems may be immediate, such as skin burns, eye and lung irritation, or delayed, such as cancer and genetic damage. Economic Impact Chemicals released into the environment contaminating soil, ground or surface water, buildings, and crops or affecting the health of the area population can prove costly to contain, remediate, and cleanup to acceptabl e standards. When the responsible party for the spill cannot be identified, it can leave the local and state government in charge of protecting the public and financing the clean -up process. Future Occurrence As the County continues to grow and attract more industrial and manufacturing companies, the potential for future hazardous material spills and release will also grow. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 119 NUCLEAR POWER PLANT ACCIDENT Hazard Characterization There are two nuclear power plants, the Braidwood Nuclear Power Station and Dresden Nuclear Generating Station, which have direct effect on the population of Will County. The areas of risk associated with these facilities are the plume emergency planning zone that encompasses a ten -mile radius of the facility and the ingestion em ergency planning zone that encompasses a fifty -mile radius. Because of the danger of exposure from radioactive materials, plants are sited away from major population centers and are designed with safety systems and back -up safety systems. Nuclear plants are required to have an emergency radiological response plan in effect. Braidwood Generating Station Exelon's newest nuclear power station is located in northeastern Illinois, approximately 20 miles southwest of Joliet and about 60 miles southwest of Chic ago in Will County. The station is built on a 4,457- acre site, and its cooling lake was formed from scarred farming land and an old strip mine. It's Units 1 and 2 began commercial operation in July and October of 1988, respectively. The initial construc tion cost for the station was $5.2 billion. Both of Braidwood's units are pressurized water reactors designed by Westinghouse. Each unit is capable of generating nearly 1,200 net megawatts and together they Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 120 can produce enough power to support the electric ity needs of over two million average American homes. Braidwood has about 885 Exelon employees. The majority of Braidwood's emp loyees live in Grundy and Will C ounties. The station's annual payroll is about $82 million. Additionally, during refuel outages, Braidwood employs several hundred temporary contractors, who boost the local economy during their stay. Exelon pays local real estate taxes totaling about $ 20.7 million every year to support county and township government, area schools, libraries, park districts and other taxing bodies. Dresden Generating Station Located in rural Grundy County, Dresden is home to the nation's first full- scale, privately financed nuclear power plant which began operation in 1960. Capable of generating 210 megawatts of electricity before its retirement in 1978, Dresden Unit 1 is designated a Nuclear Historic Landmark by the American Nuclear Society. Dresden Units 2 and 3 began commercial operation in June 1970 and November 1971, respectively. In October of 2004, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission renewed the operating licenses for both units for an additional 20 years, extending them to 2029 and 2031. Both units contain boiling water reactors designed by General Electric. Each unit is capable of generating nearly 900 megawatts of electricity, which together can produce enough power to support the electricity needs of over 1.5 million average American homes. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 121 Dresden has about 900 Exelon employees. Most of Dresden's employees live in Grundy and Will Counties. The station 's annual payroll is about $74 million. Additionally, during refueling outages, Dresden employs several hundred temporary contractors, who boost the local economy during their stay. Exelon pays local real estate taxes totaling about $ 22.4 million every y ear to support county and township government, area schools, libraries, park districts and other taxing bodies. Generation of Electricity Power plants create electricity by running steam turbines, which are powered either by the fossil fuels coal, oil, or natural gas or by nuclear power. Nuclear technology produces energy by splitting uranium atoms in a process called fission. Fission generates heat that boils water for the steam that runs the turbines, which produce the electricity that we all use making, for instance, toast for breakfast. In a nuclear power plant, pea -sized uranium pellets are stacked inside long, thin fuel rods which are grouped in \"assemblies\" inside a reactor \"core.\" The core is encased in a very thick steel capsule, and the entire reactor is further protected by an airtight ste el and concrete building called a \"containment.\" This complex structure is designed to help ensure the safe utilization of nuclear power . Waste Any fuel used to produce energy also produces waste. By -produc ts of coal -burning include smoke, ashes and slag. Even with the latest technologies, it is impossible to prevent some of this waste from reaching the environment outside the power plant. Nuclear power generation, on the other hand, produces waste primari ly in the form of spent fuel, which is not released into the environment. Besides helping to protect the environment, nuclear energy is also highly efficient, producing vastly more energy for its weight than coal or oil. We would have to burn 120+ gallon s of oil or up to a ton of coal to produce the same amount of energy as that found in a single pellet of uranium. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 122 History Worldwide Three significant accidents in the fifty year history of civil nuclear power generation are: Three Mile Island (USA 1979) The reactor was severely damaged but radiation was contained and there were no adverse health or environmental consequences . Chernobyl (Ukraine 1986) The destruction of the reactor by s team explosion and fire directly killed 4 1 people and had significant health and environmental consequences. Studies continue on the health effects on the impacted population . Fukushima (Japan 2011) Following a major earthquake, a tsunami disabled the power supply and cooling of three reactors. All three cores largely melted in the first three days. There have been no deaths or cases of radiation sickness from the nuclear accident, but over 100,000 people had to be evacuated from their homes. Studies of health effects are ongoing. Will County Nuclear regulatory agencies require testing of groundwater along with emissions from nuclear generation facilities. Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen that produces a weak level of radiation. It is produced naturally in the upper atmosphere when cosmic rays strike atmospheric gases and is produced in larger quantities as a by -product of the nuclear energy industry. When combined with oxygen, tritium has the same chemical properties as water. Tritium can be found at very low levels in nearly all water sources. The area located on the northeast corner of the Braidwood Generation Station property just south of Smiley Road was the location of tritiated water that spilled back in 1998. The highest concentration of tritium in a well from this location showed 230,000 picocur ies per liter in Dec. 2005. As of Dec. 2007, the highest on -site concentration of tritium detected in groundwater has decreased more than 90 percent to 22,800 picocuries per liter. To further expedite the remediation process and ensure increased capture of tritiated groundwater on plant property south of Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 123 Smiley Road, workers at Braidwood Station began pumping water from existing groundwater wells into a pond on Exelon property. \"We continue to see significant progress with our remediation efforts,\" said Tom Coutu, Braidwood Station site Vice -President. \"We believe that the enhanced pumping will help us reduce tritium concentrations more quickly in the area.\" The remediation process involves pumping down a pond adjacent to the plant. As the pond level lowers, the groundwater adjacent to the pond, which contains tritium, flows toward the pond. The water pumped out of the pond goes into the existing underground pipe or blowdown line and is then discharged into the Kankakee River pursuant to federal and Il linois EPA permits. The tritium in the groundwater has not affected any private drinking wells and poses no health or safety threat to the public. The U.S. EPA's drinking water limit for tritium is 20,000 picocuries per liter. Illinois Department of Publ ic Health's (IDPH) Division of Epidemiology reviewed data for Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 124 cancer incidence, childhood mortality, infant mortality, low bir th weight an d congenital anomalies in Will County and Braidwood, IL. These investigations by IDPH found that the pediatric cancer incidence and mortality rates were not significantly different from those for comparison groups. In addition, they found no evidence of an increased cancer incidence rate after the startup of the nuclear power plants. Risk Characterization Essentially, radiation is a form of energy that can travel through the air, just like light, heat or radio waves. Small amounts of radiation are naturally generated by different elements in the environment. Food, water, air and sunlight all expose us daily to tiny am ounts of radiation. Uranium is simply a more powerful source of radiation which, when used properly, can be highly beneficial. Sometimes people are concerned that a power plant reactor will \"blow up,\" but this is virtually impossible. The uranium conta ins only 3 to 4 percent fissionable material, and the fuel is further diluted to slow down the fission process. This low concentration can generate enough heat to boil water but not enough to explode. In short, there is no way for a power plant reactor t o produce a nuclear explosion. Some people also think that they, or the environment, may be accidentally exposed to nuclear radiation by living or being near a nuclear power plant. Although radioactivity can be dangerous, keep in mind that a power plant reactor is designed to contain radiation, protecting the rest of the plant and the surrounding community. To ensure the greatest safety, however, any incident at a power plant that presents the slightest potential for a leak would be addressed with the u tmost care. First, special teams would gather detailed radiation readings at the plant and throughout surrounding areas. Depending on a number of factors, which include the amount of radiation released and weather conditions that would affect movement of the radioactive \"plume\", state officials would recommend a course of action. A significant incident might require people to stay indoors or to evacuate to temporary relocation centers. In any event, you would be instructed in a safe course of action to protect yourself and your loved ones. Accidents occur in three different levels or degrees. The first degree is an accident that is handled effectively within the plant by safety systems. The second is an accident in which the safety systems malfunction and radioactive noble gases and iodine are released into the atmosphere. The third degree is a core meltdown and involves an accident in the cooling system. Three dominant exposure modes people Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 125 experience as a result of a release of radioactive material s are whole body exposure, thyroid exposure, and exposure from ingestion of radioactive materials. Regulations for nuclear power plants are stringent to ensure the public's safety. Nuclear Power Plants (6) in Illinois and the United States are subject to meeting standards established by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the State. These building and construction standards are delineated in each plant's Updated Safety Analysis Report. There are no specific land -use practices in place for area s surrounding a nuclear power plant. However, for the area surrounding each nuclear power plant, a 10- mile Emergency Planning Zone has been established. Detailed plans are established, implemented and trained against to ensure that offsite response organiz ations can effectively manage an accident at a nuclear power plant. The IEMA limits the quantities of radioactive materials a facility can have on hand at any one time. A licensing and enforcement program accomplishes this limitation. For existing nucl ear power plants, utility access controls are in place to prevent unauthorized access to the facility. The IEMA works with shippers of high hazard radioactive material to improve the performance of shipping containers. The basic characteristics of radia tion are fixed by the Laws of Physics and are immutable. IEMA is working with manufacturers of high hazard radioactive materials to improve their basic structural integrity and reduce the probability of release during normal use and accident conditions. The Bureau of Nuclear Facility Safety (BNFS) reviews all licensing issues to ensure the requirements for nuclear power plant protective systems and equipment are maintained. Additionally IEMA's Resident Inspectors routinely inspect these systems for opera bility and maintenance activities. IEMA Response personnel are equipped with appropriate radiological detection and monitoring instrumentation, personal protective equipment, dosimetry, training and procedures to handle a radiological emergency. Nuclear power plants are designed, built and operated with redundant and diverse critical systems and equipment. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 126 Impact: High Damage to Buildings Damage to property is low; however, contamination could have major adverse effects rendering buildings and facilit ies unusable. Critical Facilities Damage or destruction of the nuclear generation station would impact the production and delivery of electricity to the area. Complete shutdown of the Braidwood station could impact electric service to as many as two million homes. The shutdown of Dresden could impact electric service to as many as one and a half million homes. Water and sewer utilities would be unable to function without electricity to power pumps. Health and Safety Radiation is measured in rems or in mi llirems (thousandths of a rem). On average, a person living in Illinois receives about 300 millirem of radiation annually from natural sources and another 60 millirem or so from X -rays and other medical procedures. It takes more than 60 times this much, over 20,000 millirem in a single day, to produce identifiable effects in the body. Federal regulations allow workers to receive up to 5,000 millirem of radiation in the course of a year's work. Economic Impact The partial or complete loss of electric gene ration would have a severe economic impact on Will County and the surrounding area. Homes and businesses would lose the use of utilities necessary for everyday living and business activities. Transportations systems would be impeded since road and railw ays would lose the use of lights and signals necessary for controlling traffic. Fuel would become unavailable without functioning fuel pumps. Most needed services would be impacted. Generating and Relay Stations Major Electrical Transmission Lines Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 127 Future Occurrences There have been t hree major reactor accidents in the history of civil nuclear power: Three Mile Island , Chernobyl , and Fukushima nuclear disaster s. These are the only major accidents to have occurred in more than 1 4,500 cumulative reactor years of commercial operations in thirty -three countries. One was contained without harm to anyone, the next involved an intense fire without provision for containment, and the third severely tested the containment, allowing some release of radioactivity. Extraordinary effort has been put into safety and security issue s to safeguard the public against harmful incidents with stringent regulations enforced by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The risks from western nuclear power plants, in terms or the consequences of an accident or terrorist attack, are minimal. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 128 Major Natural Gas Transmission Lines PIPELINE RUPTURES Hazard Characterization Pipelines are a potential hazard because of the materials conveyed within them. The most common materials carried by pipelines are petroleum, crude oil, propane, ammonia, kerosene, and natural gas. Pipelines range in diameter from 3/8 inch to 3+ feet in diameter with many of the pipes having been laid more than twenty- five years ago. Elements in the soil such as moisture, bacteria, or acids act on the pipes causing damaging exposure. The release of material because of pipe failure due to age or breakage during excavation work can cause explosion, fire, pollution, or loss of communication or power. Pipeline failures can also be secondary to land subsidence, earthquake, fires, or erosion. Pipelines are the saf est method of transporting materials; however, it is not without problems. The results of pipeline failure are injuries, fatalities, and/ or property damage. Pipeline failures are a potential hazard within Will County because of the vast network that tra vels through the County into Chicago. The County is a major hub in the United States natural gas pipeline grid where pipelines from Canada and the Gulf of Mexico meet and then fan out to serve the Midwest. The federal government establishes minimum pipeline safety standards under the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 49 \"Transportation\", Parts 190 - 199. The Office of Pipelin e Safety (OPS), within the U.S. Department of Transportation, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), has overall regulatory responsibility for hazardous liquid and gas pipelines under its jurisdiction in the United States. OPS ins pects and enforces the pipeline safety requirements for interstate gas pipeline operators in Illinois. OPS also inspects and enforces the pipeline safety regulations for both intrastate and interstate hazardous liquid pipeline operators in Illinois. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 129 Operator compliance with state and federal pipeline safety regulations is monitored through a comprehensive inspection and enforcement program. T he Illinois Commerce Commission, Pipelines Safety Section , certification by OPS , is in charge of identifying and c hecking standards of safety within the State of Illinois. They work in partnership with the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) to assure pipeline operators are meeting requirements for safe, reliable, and environmentall y sound operation of their facilities. The program is comprised of field inspections of operations, maintenance, and construction activities; programmatic inspections of operator procedures, processes, and records; incident investigations and corrective a ctions; and through direct dialogue with operator management. PHMSA's 135 federal inspectors and our 375 state partners are responsible for regulating over 3,100 operators who operate 2.6 million miles of pipelines, 129 liquefied natural gas fa cilities, and 6,448 hazardous liquid breakout tanks. Through PHMSA oversight programs, significant pipeline incidents have decreased by 12.5% since 2008. Pipeline safety personnel spend 80 percent of their time conducting safety -related activities, includ ing inspections and incident investigations on the ground, in the lab, and at the office, as well as enforcement and public outreach. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 130 While PHMSA serves as the federal pipeline safety regulator, pipeline operators must know, understand, and manage the ris ks associated with their own pipeline facilities. In addition to PHMSA inspections, operators frequently conduct internal reviews of their procedures, facilities, staff and emergency procedures. History There are numerous causes of pipeline incidents. Alm ost 40% of the national incidents are a result of material failure or corrosion, over 25% are caused by human error or excavation damage, and 6.6% are a result of natural forces such as earth movement or floods. Will County has 814 miles of liquid pipe line and 649 mile of gas pipeline. Twenty incidents involving death, injury, or property damage or combination thereof have occurred in Will County in the last twenty years. In April, 1999, a natural gas pipeline was struck during excavation work injuring 7 people, destroying 34 town homes, and damaging 199 homes out of 394. Reportable Incidents Hazardous Liquids Pipeline Incident: An event or failure in a pipeline system that must be reported to the Office of Pipeline Safety and that results in the release of a hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide and in any of the following: Explosion or fire not intentionally set by the operator Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 131 Release of 5 gallons (19 liters) or more of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide, except that no report is required for a releas e of less than 5 barrels (0.8 cubic meters) resulting from a pipeline maintenance activity if the release is: Not otherwise reportable under this section (i.e., 49 CFR 195.50), Not one described in 49 CFR 195.52(a)(4), Confined to company property or pipel ine right -of-way, and Cleaned up promptly; Death of any person Personal injury necessitating hospitalization Estimated property damage, including cost of cleanup and recovery, value of lost product, and damage to the property of the operator or others, or both, exceeding $50,000 (49 CFR 149.50). Involves a release of gas from a pipeline or of liquefied natural gas (LNG) or gas from an LNG facility and results in Natural Gas Pipeline Incident: An event in the natural gas pipeline system that must be reported to the Office of Pipeline Safety and: Death, or personal injury necessitating in- patient hospitalization; or Estimated property damage, including cost of gas lost, and damage to the property of the operator or others, or both, of $50,000 or more. Result s in an emergency shutdown of an LNG facility. Is significant, in the judgment of the operator, even though it did not meet the criteria of (1) or (2) above (49 CFR 191.3). Risk Characterization As communities and pipelines grow closer together, concerns about protecting people and the environment from risk of pipeline incidents have increased. Community awareness and involvement programs are a key component to safeguarding pipeline safety. By knowing where pipelines are located and how to manage activit ies near them, we can live safely around them. Risks associated with pipeline incidents are explosion, contamination, asphyxiation, and fire resulting in injury, death, and property damage. Leaking pipes can send hazardous liquids into the soil or water or gases into the atmosphere. Fortunately, major incidents are infrequent. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 132 Many transmission lines were laid decades ago through sparsely populated states in the Sun Belt and through West Coast states. These areas are now experiencing rapid population growth, raising concern about increased numbers of people living or working close to pipelines. Moreover, many lines that serve major cities and that run through heavily developed areas were constructed in what were then sparsely populated, rural areas. Few of these areas had extensive land use or zoning regulation in place at the time the lines were laid. Natural gas and petroleum pipelines are relatively secure because the majo rity of pipeline mileage is below ground. Operators generally also have in place security measures to protect pipeline facilities from vandalism or intrusion. This includes the employment of such measures as guards, fences and electronic surveillance around facilities. Operators provide added protection against security concerns by conducting employee background checks, and carrying out communications with residents along pipeline rights -of-way, with police authorities, and with emergency responders in af fected communities.

The Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), along with the Department of Homeland Secu rity and the pipeline industry began looking at ways to enhance the security of our energy pipeline infrastructure thereby ensuring that critical energy transportation was not disrupted. Enhanced communication networks were developed to share information on suspicious activities and potential threats to the pipeline infrastructure and to begin identifying noteworthy and possible enhancements to help assure the security of hazardous liquid and natural gas pipeline systems. Following 9/11/01, OPS undertook several initiatives to help reduce the increased threat of terrorist activity against pipelines: Communications Vulnerability Assessments Developing consensus security guidance with the pipeline industry and states on conducting vulnerability assessments , improving security plans, developing specific deterrent and protective actions, and upgrading response and recovery plans Obtaining executive -level commitment from pipeline operators to implement needed security provisions described in the guidance Devel oping a definition for \"critical pipeline facility\" and a system of recommended deterrent and protective measures that are synchronized with the threat control levels of the Office of Homeland Security's threat warning system Drafting and distributing for review by state and federal officials initial verification audit protocols Soliciting R&D proposals to detect encroachments, continuously monitor rights -of-ways and improve system controls Working with DOE and FERC to address issues related to rapid resp onse and recovery of critical pipeline service in the case of a pipeline disturbance. The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act (PSIA) of 2002 serves to further strengthen regulations regarding pipeline safety and security. Federal pipeline safety regulations require pipeline operators to conduct continuing public awareness programs to provide pipeline safety information to four stakeholder audiences: Affected Public Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 134 Emergency Officials Local Public Officials Excavator s OPS will continue its efforts relative to pipeline security by: Collaborating with pipeline operators, state pipeline safety agencies, and other federal agencies to continue identifying critical facilities using the established definition of \"critical pipeline facility\" Continuing work with the DOE, FERC and other federal agencies, states and the pipeline industry to advance planning for rapid response and recovery of damaged pipeline systems. This will include identifying and resolving barriers to recovery, including the sharing of critical parts and the need for emergency authorities Planning and conducting regional exercises with emphasis on response and recovery Continuing to work with state pipeline safety agencies to verify that pipeline operators have developed and implemented securit y, response and recovery plans for critical pipeline facilities Impact: Moderate Damage to Buildings Pipeline incidents can cause extensive damage to buildings through contamination, fire, or explosion. Critical Facilities The United States currently con sumes about 63 billion cubic feet of natural gas daily, nearly all of which is transported by pipeline and about 19.5 million barrels of petroleum products. Interruptions in pipeline service can cause delays in natural gas production and utilities, and chemical processing plants who utilize the products transported through the pipeline system. Communication systems or electric power can also be lost when underground lines are damaged. Health and Safety Injuries and deaths occur when fire, explosion, or no xious fumes result when pipelines are damaged or fail due to corrosion or material defects. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 135 Economic Impact Being that Will County is a major pipeline hub, a damaged pi peline can cause an interruption in service of that product not only locally but also throughout the region of its transport. This can cause a loss of natural gas needed to heat buildings or petroleum products being sent to refineries or processing center s causing delays in production. Future Occurrence Due to its location, Will County has throughout its borders numerous pipeline systems carrying hazardous liquid and gas products. There is risk of serious incidents due to the nature of these products; however, government agencies and the pipeline industries are working together to promote and improve safety throughout the pipeline systems. PIPELINE INCIDENTS PROBABILITY Number of Occurrences Since 1988 Annual Mean 31 1.2 Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 136 NON- HAZARDOUS MATERIAL TRANSPORTATION Hazard Characterization The transportation sector consists of roads, commuter and freight rail services, regional buses, waterways, and bikeways that transport goods and people. Being proximate to Chicago has led Will County to develop an intricate and varied transportation system for the conveyance of raw materials, finis hed goods, workers, and tourists in and out of Chicago and its metropolitan area. It has developed over decades as a result of public and private investment. The diversity and size of the transportation sector makes it essential to the County's economy a nd security. Regardless of the mode of transportation, accidents can and do occur. Motor vehicles, airplanes, trains, or boats are all subject to the risk of accidents. These accidents can occur anywhere within the transportation system because of the driver's error, mechanical failure, poor weather conditions, or Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 137 sabotage. With the many major highways, rail lines, airports, and waterways, Will County does experience transportation accidents and must be prepared to provide immediate emergency response . Though accidents normally are not considered disasters, the results of an accident can be of severe magnitude and it is these incidents that are addressed in preparedness planning. Multiple car and truck accidents, train derailments, airplane crashes, a nd boat accidents can cause mass injuries or kill many people. Fire and explosions may result from the impact. Property can be damaged or destroyed by the accident. Any incident that slows or shuts down a major transportation route will affect the trave l time of people and the transportation flow of raw materials and goods. To mitigate accidents, laws and regulations require driver training, provide rules for vehicle operation, and regulate vehicle maintenance. Laws and regulations cannot eliminate acc idents, but they can help to lower the incidence of accidents. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 138 History With I -80 and I -55 being major transportation routes, numerous accidents have occurred on these highways. On January 25, 2002, a 15-passenger van was traveling too fast on icy roads. It slid out of control, crossed the median, and was struck b y an on -coming tractor trailer. All eleven passengers in the vehicle were killed. Another highway incident occurred near Braidwood on April 30, 1999 involving a bus. Twenty people were injured and one was killed. Train accidents have also involved man y injuries. On April 6, 1989, fifty- eight people were injured; on March 21, 1988, sixteen were injured; and on July 1, 1987, twenty- eight were injured and one was killed. IMPACT OF NON -HAZARDOUS MATERIAL TRANSPORTATION EVENTS ON WILL COUNTY (Source: National Transportation Safety Board / WC EMA) Date Type Location Injuries Deaths 01/25/2001 Highway I-80 & I-55 0 11 04/30/1999 Highway Braidwood 20 1 04/06/1989 Train Lemont 58 0 03/21/1988 Train 16 07/01/1987 Train Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 139 Risk Characterization Interdependences exist between the various modes of transporta tion as goods are moved in and out of the County between highway, rail, and water. Interdependences also exist between transportation and every other sector of the economy. Consequently, accidents in the transportation sector may impact other industries that rely on it for its transport of raw materials, finished goods, and workers. Impact: Moderate Transportation Modes Airports: The aviation mode has the symbolic value of representing the freedom of movement that Americans value so highly along with the technological and industrial prowess which has made the United States a world power. The nation's aviation system consists of airports/airplanes and the associated assets needed to support their operations and aviation command, control, communication s, and information systems needed to maintain safe use of our national airspace. Will County has six private or general aviation airports that provide business and recreational aerial service to the local area. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 140 Bridges: Vehicular and railroad bridges r epresent choke points and therefore play a very critical role and present unique challenges. Within Will County are major bridges that cross waterways, railways, and connect major interstates that are important links in the transportation system. Should they be damaged or destroyed, emergency response and movement of both commercial and private vehicles would be severely hampered. Highways: The trucking and busing industry is a fundamental component of not only our national but also our County transport ation infrastructure. Without the transportation sector's resources, the movement of people, goods, and services would be greatly impeded. Components of this infrastructure include highways, roads, inter -modal terminals, bridges, tunnels, trucks, buses, and maintenance facilities. Millions of privately owned and commercial trucking vehicles utilize the extensive interstate system that crosses Illinois on a daily basis, and millions of tons of goods are shipped in and out of the state each year. The inte rstate network is vital to the commercial trucking industry for both intra - and inter -state shipments of products. There are three major travel corridors within Will County: first, a northeasterly flow to and from Chicago from the northwestern sections of the County; second, a north -south flow to and from Chicago from the central and eastern sections of the County; and third, a north- south inter -suburban flow between Will and DuPage Counties that provide work commuting routes. The County 's highway system consists of four interstate highways and nine state highways. The interstate highway system is designed as a paved, four -lane, high -speed vehicle travel corridor that allows virtually uninterrupted travel through the Chicago Metropolitan Area and to othe r parts of Illinois and surrounding states. Over one -hundred County highways exist to provide service between interstate and state highways while township roads serve the needs of the farming community and municipal streets serve local and through traffic within the cities and villages. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 141 Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 142 Railroads/ Train Stations: Illinois is viewed as the center of the nation's rail network. Chicago is considered the railroad capital and has established its status as the nation's railroad intermodal hub. There are roughly 7,300 route miles or railroad lines in Illinois and approximately 4,000 of those miles are vital to the transportation of freight and passengers within Illinois. More than 40 railroads are able to provide service from Illinois to every part of th e United States. Trains carry mining, manufacturing, and agricultural products; liquid chemicals and fuels; and consumer goods. The EJ&E Railroad (now the Canadian National) and BNSF Railway Company provide transportation of goods and Metra provides comm uter transportation in and out of Will County. Two new intermodal centers are up and running in Will County. Approximately 454 million tons of freight, or 24.5 percent of the total tons of freight carried, go through Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 143 Illinois. Coal, an essential resourc e for the generation of electricity, composes almost 20% of the freight. Passenger trains transport over 20 million intercity travelers annually, and 45 million passengers use trains and subways operated by local transit authorities. Metra provides commu ter transportation in and out of Will County. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 144 Health and Safety Traffic accidents are influenced by weather conditions, speed of traffic, and the number of vehicles occupying the road. Conditions that lead to accidents include rain, fog, ice, heavy rain, strong winds, high speed, and heavy traffic congestion. Accordingly, people are injured or killed as a result of accidents. Economic Impact Short delays due to slow downs or shut downs in transportation systems are the most common results of accidents. Should a major transportation route be shut down for an extended period of time, people traveling through that area and businesses transporting raw materials and goods could be impacted until that route is repaired. Future Occurrence As the C ounty grows in population and business/manufacturing entities, use of all transportation systems will increase and likely increase in the number of accidents. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 145 FIRE Hazard Characterization Fire is any occurrence of uncontrolled burning which results in major structural damage to residential, commercial, industrial, institutional, or other types of property. In urban areas where buildings are set close together, fire can jump from one building to another, resulting in major conflagration. Embers from these fires can travel by wind to the roofs of other structures setting off secondary fires. Fire can also damage forests and grassy areas. Fire at an industrial site may involve flammable or hazardous materials. Fire may ensue at a gasoline service sta tion or from a damaged pipeline. Fire may result into a serious explosion. Along with property damage, it is a hazard to the County community causing injury or death to its residents. It can damage communication and power lines or force evacuation of the affected area. History Numerous fires have occurred in the history of Will County. Major occurrences include: IMPACT OF FIRES ON WILL COUNTY (Source: WC EMA /Local News Media Reports ) Date Location Type Impact August 14, 2001 Lemont Refinery Fire $25 million damages July 2, 1999 Channahon Propane Explosion 2 Injured April 29, 1999 Romeoville Pipeline Rupture 7 Injured 34 Townhomes destroyed 199 out 394 homes damaged March 17, 1990 Lemont Refinery Fire 1 Injured 65,000 gal.

Urban fires may result in very costly damages. Urban communitie s with newer industrial and business facilities are reasonably secure from potential conflagration. These buildings are generally constructed of fire resistive materials, protected with automatic sprinkler systems, equipped with fire extinguishing and fir e detection systems, and reasonably well separated. Prevention is a simple solution to reduce destructive fires. It is incumbent upon each citizen to prepare and practice fire safety. Good public education programs on fire safety, fire alarms, and fire response are important prevention measures. Impact: Low Damage to Buildings Fires cause serious damage or destruction to buildings. Critical Facilities Critical facilities can be seriously damaged or destroyed by fires disrupting services to business es and household. Health and Safety Fires cause serious burns, injuries, smoke inhalation, and death to individuals inside burning buildings, first responders, and area population when hazardous chemicals are released into the atmosphere as a result of fir e or explosion. Economic Impact Injury, loss of property, and business interruption can have devastating economic impact to individuals, businesses, industry, and populations served by affected businesses and infrastructure. There may or may not be insura nce to cover the cost of structure repair or replacement, injuries, or lost business. Future Occurrence The risk of fire is always a potential but can be mitigated with fire safety practices, fire detection systems, fire suppression equipment, and fire res istive materials. New facilities must meet building codes which are implemented to reduce fire risk for the protection of people and property. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 147 DAM FAILURE Hazard Characterization A dam is built to control water and can be made from earth, rocks, or concr ete. Dams are usually constructed on rivers to store water in a reservoir during times of excess flow and then released as needed. They are important because they provide water for drinking, industrial processes, fishing, recreation, navigation, and transport of raw goods on rivers. The water impounded behind a dam is referred to as the reservoir and is measured in acre -feet, with one acre -foot being the volume of water that covers one acre of land to a depth of one foot. Due to topography, even a small dam may have a reservoir containing many acre -feet of water. Dam failure is an accidental or unintentional collapse or other failure of an impoundment structure that results in downstream flooding. Dams are man -made structures and dam failures are usual ly considered technological hazards; however, dams usually fail as a result of the secondary effects of storms. Dam failures may result from natural events, human -caused events, or a combination thereof. Failure can result in the release of the reservoir contents that include water, mine wastes or agricultural refuse causing a negative impact upstream or downstream or at location remote from the dam. A flood that is caused by the breach of a dam may be of greater magnitude than floods originating from th e runoff of rainfall or snowmelt. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 148 Will County is situated on the Illinois Waterway System, a primary waterway -barge link between the St. Lawrence Seaway, the Great Lakes, the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico. The system follows along the I & M Canal and the Des Plaines River through Will County, providing manufacturers with excellent low -cost barge shipping opportunities for bulk materials. Coal, petroleum products, chemicals, metals and ores, non -metallic minerals, grain, stone, sand, clay, and cement are among the major commodities that travel through Will County on the Illinois Waterway System. Will County is home to the third greatest number of public and private waterway terminals in Illinois. The Illinois Waterway system consists of 336 miles of water from the mouth of the Chicago River to the mouth of the Illinois River at Grafton, Illinois . It is a system of rivers, lakes, and canals which provide a shipping connection from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico via the Mississippi River . The Illinois and Michigan Canal opened in 1849. In 1900, the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal replaced it and reversed the flow of the Chicago River so it no longer flowed into Lake Michigan. The United States Army Corps of Engineers maintain s a 9 foot deep navigation channel in the waterway . A series of seven locks control water flows from Lake Michigan to the Mississippi River system. Two of those lock and dam systems are located in Will County: Brandon Road Lock and Dam and Lockport Lock and Dam. Wilmington Dam Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 149 Brandon Road Lock and Dam Brandon R oad Pool is created by Brandon Road Lock and Dam on the Des Plaines River in Will County, Illinois, and is used for improved navigation purposes. It connects from the Chicago River (connecting to Lake Michigan) to the Illinois River. It was completed in 1933. It is owned by U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. Brandon Road Lock and Dam, also known as Brandon Road Pool , is a gravity dam. The core is homogeneous, earth, concrete, and metal. The foundation is rock. Though originally completed in 1933, the st ructure was modified in 1985. Its height is 40 feet with a length of 14 ,250 feet. Its capacity is 4,500 acre feet. Normal storage is 4,500 acre feet. It drains an area of 1 ,500 square miles. Lockport Lock and Dam This lock and dam is located in Lockp ort, Illinois, within the three -mile lower reach of the Chicago Sanitary Ship Canal which extends from the Chicago River to the Illinois Waterway. The Lockport upper pool is perched 38 feet above the surrounding communities. The lock has a width of 110 f eet and length of 600 feet. It was completed in 1933. Rehabilitation work was completed in 1989.

The Approach Dike is presently under repair with a 300 foot test section of full depth concrete cut -off wall being constructed. If successful, it will lead to 4,300 feet of t he dike receiving a full depth cut -off wall.

Dams are categorized according to the degree of threat to life and property in the breach wave inundation area: Class I Failure has a high probability of causing loss of life or su bstantial economic loss, similar to that of US Army Corps of Engineers High Hazard Potential or USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service Class (c) dams. Class II Failure has a moderate probability for causing loss of life or substantial economic loss, similar to USCOE Significant Hazard Potential or USDA/NRCS Class (b) dams. Class III Failure has a low probability for causing loss of life or substantial economic loss, similar to the USCOE Low Hazard Potential or USDA/NRCS Class (a) dams. The health a nd safety concerns are similar to flooding, but the nature of the breach wave flood creates a higher level of damage to structures and a higher velocity of flow in open areas.

The possibility of dam failure is rare if dams and locks are properly maintained and inspected. Risk Characterization The affected area for dam failure includes the dam and the area impacted by the release of the water in the reservoir. For the most part, there are few people on the dam and the health and safety impacts are negligible. The threat in the area below the dam can be significant. Damages are similar to flooding with increased structural damages due to the higher velocities of flow. Responders will experience the same hazards as in other flood response situations. More than half of the 240 opera tional Corps funded lock chambers in the U.S., which handle over 625 million tons of freight each year, are over 50 years old and have exceeded their economic design lives. The replacement value of our lock and dam facilities has been estimated at more than $125 billion. Owned and operated by the federal government, the system's infrastructure has been recapitalized with an investment at the grossly inadequate level of approximately $220 million annually over the past 10 years, although this trend has beg un to improve in the past few years. Many locks currently in use are too small for today's larger tows . This leaves the dams susceptible to closures and long delays for repairs and unable to deal effectively with lines and wait times that result from th eir obsolescence. On the Upper Mississippi River, for instance, many lock chambers are 600 feet in length. However, the average length of a modern tow (15 barges pushed by a towboat) is 1,200 feet.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reports increasing amounts of scheduled and unscheduled downtime at the locks on Ame rica's inland navigatio n system. In 2005, for example, the Corps reported navigation locks were unavailable (scheduled and unscheduled without ice) for about 110,000 hours (about 4,600 days). Queue delays at congested or unavailable locks cost the industry hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Waterborne transportation is generally out of sight, out of mind. But the inland waterways transportation system binds us together in this country and allows us to turn on lights, eat our cereal in the morning, and drive our cars t o work. It deserves our support and our commitment to nurture it, not neglect it. Impact: Low Dam Failures Dam failures usually occur when the spillway capacity is inadequate and water overtops the dam or when internal erosion through the dam foundation occurs, also known as piping. If internal erosion or overtopping cause s a full structural breach, a high -velocity, debris -laden wall of water is released and rushes downstream, damaging or destroying whatever is in its path. Dam failures may result from one or more the following: Prolonged periods of rainfall and flooding [the cause of most failures Inadequate spillway capacity which causes excess overtopping flows Internal erosion due to embankment or foundation leakage or piping Improper maintenance Improper design Negligent operation Failure of upstream dams Landslides into reservoirs High winds Earthquakes. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 154 For emergency planning purposes, dam failures are categorized as either rainy day or sunny day failures. Rainy day failures involve periods of excessive precipitation leading to an unusually high runoff. This high runoff increases the reservoir of the dam and if not controlled, the overtopping of the dam or excessive water pressure can lead to dam failure. Normal storm events can also lead to rainy day failures if water outlets are plugged with debris or otherwise made inoperable. Sunny day failures occur due to poor dam maintenance, damage/obstruction of outlet systems, or vandalism. This is the worst type of failure and can be catastrophic because the breach is unexpected and there may be insufficient time to properly warn downstream residents. If a dam suffers a partial or complete failure, the potential energy of the water stored behind even a small dam can cause loss of life and great prope rty damage downstream. The following factors influence the impact of a dam failure: Level of failure (partial or complete) Rapidity of failure (sudden or gradual) Amount of water released Nature of the development or infrastructure located downstream Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 155 Damage to Buildings Buildings downstream of a dam failure can be inundated and lost due to flooding. Damages are similar to flooding with increased structural damages due to the higher velocities of flow. Critical Facilities Essential utilities and facilities can be damaged or lost from resultant flooding due to dam failure. Health and Safety Injury and loss of life can occur when a dam fails or water overspills its banks. Damages to the environment are typically less than flooding. Duration of inundation due to dam failure is short. Economic Impact The economic impact from dam failure is s imilar to flooding. The local economy can be affected when businesses and homes are flooded by the overspill of a dam. Dam Failure can have a serious effect on the mov ement of goods through our waterway system that would have an impact beyond our local economic area. Our country's inland navigation system plays a critical role in our nation's economy, moving hundreds of millions of tons of domestic commerce valued at $ 300 billion annually. Additionally, our inland waterways facilitate a significant portion of the $851.5 billion worth of imports and exports to and from the United State each year. Specific data regarding economic impact can be found through IEMA - Economic Impact Multi -Hazards Estimates binder. Future Occurrence With five high hazard dams, Will County is vulnerable to dam failure; however, the likelihood of occurrence is low. DAM FAILURE PROBABILITY Number of Occurrences Since 1990 Annual Mean 7 .44 Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 156 LAND SUBSIDENCE Hazard Characterization Land subsidence is any vertical displacement or downward movement of a generally level ground surface resulting from either natural or man -induced surface or subsurface conditions. Natural subsidence occur s when the ground collapses into underground cavities produced by the solution of limestone or other soluble materials by groundwater. Drought or excessive rainfall can also cause sinkholes. Human - induced subsidence is caused mainly by groundwater withdr awal, drainage of organic soils, and underground mining. Loosely packed materials tend to compact and sink as time passes. In an open field, subsidence presents no real problem. Gradually, depressions make the land marshy and unfit for cultivation. T he problem becomes serious where land has been developed. Subsidence poses a greater risk to property than to life and generally affects very few people. Mine subsidence may take years to become apparent. As subsidence occurs, buildings begin to crack a nd slope to one side. Severe subsidence can result in complete collapse or deterioration serious enough to warrant the building being condemned. Roads can collapse. Gas mains and sewer lines underlying the building may also crack, thus causing secondary problems with explosions, fire, or flooding. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 157 History No history of mine subsidence is available for review in this plan. While over 750,000 acres of the state have been undermined, the occurrence of mine subsidence, statistically, is fairly infrequent . Risk Characterization The southwestern portion of Will County was once the site of shaft coalmines. Most of these mines were abandoned around the turn of the century, but the mined- out areas still exist. Estimates th at were taken Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 158 from the Illinois Geological Survey maps indicate that about one -eighth of the County was undermined. The communities of Diamond, Godley, and Braidwood have extensive underminings. Mine subsidence is affected by three aspects of Illinois geology: Much Illinois coal exists between weak layers of shale, claystone, limestone, and sandstone. These layers form a weak mine roof, allowing eventual collapse between support pillars. The layer under most Illinois coal is a soft clay, providing a poor foundation for mine roof support pillars, which can sink and collapse the mine. Illinois' soft coal tends to deteriorate upon contact with air in the mine. This means that roof support pillars carved out of the coal are prone to crumble and fail. Impact: Low Damage to Buildings Damage to property from mine subsidence can range from mild to severe. The following conditions may indicate a mine subsidence loss, but it is important to note that these conditions are often times the result of normal ground movement due to changes in soil moisture or seasonal temperature changes. Sudden appearance of cracks in the building's foundation, exterior walls, basement or garage floors Foundation, porch or steps appear to pull away from the frame of the house Tilt in the house ; doors start swinging open, or shut, or become jammed Windows start sticking, jamming, or even breaking Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 159 Noticeable separations between walls and floors Water pipes break, resulting in contaminated tap water, loss of water pressure or interior water damage Popping or snapping might be heard as the ground shifts If mine subsidence is the cause, it is likely that several of these problems will develop. Initial damage may occur within a few days or gradually over months. Ground movement from mine subsidence usually continues for years. Future Occurrence It is theoretically possible for an entire mine to collapse. Generally, with mine subsidence, it will not be an extensive area, usually less than 3 acres. Probably the mo st effective way of stopping mine subsidence is to eliminate gravity. Since we can not do that, mine subsidence probably can not be fully stopped. Modern mining techniques, such as those used in Illinois today, minimize the potential for future mine subs idence. The Illinois Mine Subsidence Insurance Fund generally investigates losses caused by older mines, which were mined a generation or two ago. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 160 TERRORIST ATTACK Hazard Characterization The Code of Federal Regulations defines terrorism as \"... an intentional, unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of poli tical or social objectives.\" The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) adds that terrorism can be domestic or international. FEMA's definition of terrorism incorporates the use of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) which would include biological, chemical, nuclear, and radiological weapons; arson, incendiary, explosive, and armed attacks; industrial sabotage and intentional hazardous materials releases; agriterrorism; and cyberterrorism. The intent of these activities is to instill fear into a community a nd cause death or serious injury to people or significant damage to property or information systems. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), there is no universal definition of terrorism, despite decades of debate, and the term can b e interpreted in many ways. Common usage of the term has become a catchall that includes political violence and non -political criminals. Complicating the issue of defining terrorism even further, U.S. statutes do not include terrorism as a crime. Accordingly, terrorists are arrested for elements of their terrorist acts, such as murder or weapons violations. Terrorism Components Description Violence/ Force Violence/For ce only needs to be threatened as long as the act is perceived to be real. Violence is utilized to achieve maximum publicity in order to create psychological effects beyond the immediate physical damage. Victims as Pawns Victims are not necessarily the d irect targets but are used as pawns to cause fear in those who witness the attack. The plight of the victim is intended to frighten onlookers into a course of political or social action. The randomness of the choice of victim increases fear and anxiety. Fear/Terror Psychological techniques are used to bring about conformity of behavior. Fear is the actual agent of change. Fear erodes people's trust in the government to protect them and they push officials to fulfill the terrorist's demands. Observers as Audience Terrorists are trying to gain the attention of society, not necessarily the victim. Those who observe the act are the targets or \"audience\". Media coverage can further the terrorist's cause by broadcasting the act and the terrorist's agenda. Political or Social Change The intention of the act is to generate the public's fear or distrust in the government in order to force change in political, social, economic, religious, or ideological beliefs in order to facilitate the terrorist's desired change. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 161 Definition In order to assess vulnerability to terrorism, a common understanding of what terrorism is must be deciphered. It is probably best to agree that the meaning of terrorism changes over time as political and social settings change. The meaning of terrorism may need to be adaptable just as terrorists are adaptable to events and surroundings in order to further their cause. Most definitio ns studied incorporate the key elements of violence, victims, fear, observers, and political/social causes. By accepting these five elements as a basis for the meaning of terrorism, it will allow us to move forward to assess potential vulnerability to ter rorist acts. Many state and local law enforcement agencies have a broader definition of terrorism than the FBI whose statistics point to low levels of terrorist activity. Unlike the FBI, these agencies recognize right -wing extremists (Neo -Nazi, anti - Semitic, anti -federalist) and identify specific organizations (anti-abortion, animal right, environmentalist) as the most likely sources of terrorism within their commun ities. A broader definition of terrorism at the local level may be a good thing. In the assessment process, a broader definition of terrorism may allow planners to identify a more expa nsive range of potential terrorists, targets, methods, weapons, etc. A wider range of terrorist possibilities requires local planners to prepare a more comprehensive plan to avert or Types of Terrorists Description International Supported by a government, but the terrorism is directed against citizens or agencies of other states. Domestic Local, national acts by individuals or groups acting independently of any government support. Left or Right - wing Left-wing groups strive to reform or overthrow the established government for the greater freedom or well-being of the common man. Their actions tend to be symbolic; rarely do they act to cause widespread, arbitrary casualti es. Right -wing groups endeavor to maintain the power of the state or to preserve the advantages held by a certain group. There is often a religious, racial, or politically paranoid survivalist dimension to their ideas. They can be extremely violent. Special Interests Groups may support \"liberal\" or \"conservative\" issues; like left- wing groups, less lethal in their actions. Special interest groups include those who may oppose legalized abortion or nuclear power, radical environmentalists, and militant animal rights activists. Anarchists Perceives themselves as the purest of terrorists, live to destroy state's authority and strive for complete freedom. Their politics are the most extreme. Neo-Fascists Share characteristics with communism. They are revolutionary, look to overturn the entire order and create a new order of the most far -reaching sort. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 162 mitigate such disasters. Terrorists tend to prefer situations that maximize the element of surprise. A community that has carefully identif ied its most likely targets and instituted protective measures against terrorism is a less desirable victim to terrorists. By having an understanding of the broader range of possible terrorist methods, more expansive methods of detection, aversion, traini ng, response, and recovery can be developed in order to secure the safety of the community and avert the potential of terrorism. Weapons Bombs, firearms, and limited range rockets continue to be the most common weapons used by today's terrorists. These w eapons are easy to obtain, transport, and use. Occurring more frequently is the use of secondary explosives to increase casualties. The concern is the growing use of unconventional weapons. These include chemical, biological, and radiological weapons, m ore commonly referred to as Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). These weapons have increased capacity to kill large numbers of people. The use of WMDs is limited because they are more difficult to obtain and handle. Just the thought of their use creates massive fear and may make the use of such weapons more appealing to terrorists. Targets Terrorists target infrastructure that are more critical to daily operations and are harder to restore to service. Interrupting and disabling services that the public depends on for health, economic, and social activities brings attention and recognition that terrorist groups seek. The impact of the attack is furthered when critical infrastructures are interconnected. With advances in communication and technology, mo re and more critical infrastructures are becoming dependent upon the others. The literature on terrorism shows that some critical infrastructures are targeted more often than others because of the nature of the services they provide. Areas most vulnerabl e to terrorism include transportation systems, industry, utilities, and entertainment/recreation venues. Attacking these critical infrastructures disables important services the public depends on or may cause further damage to the population and structure s surrounding the attack area. History Incidents of terrorism have been minimal within Will County. Two groups are known to operate within Will County. One is the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) whose cause is to support animal rights. ALF is Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 163 described by their founder, Ronnie Lee, as a \"... non-violent guerilla organization, dedicated to the liberation of animals from all forms of cruelty and persecution at the hands of mankind.\" There are many variations within the types of terrorist activities. Whi le natural hazards may be readily identifiable and somewhat predictable, terrorist activities cannot be reliably predicted. Terrorists are not under any one person or nation's control, but identify with various national or international communities, religions, cults, or philosophies. Thus, terrorist type activities can occur anywhere at any time. As a nation, we have experienced occurrences of terrorism. The Boston Marathon bombing, Columbine High School shootings, attacks of 9/11, anthrax mailings, and Washington, D.C. area sniper shootings are examples of how difficult it is to anticipate when and where such random acts of human- caused disasters may occur. As the population of Will County grows and more industrial and sports/ entertainment Activists turned from legal tactics of hunt disruption to illegal tactics of sabotage when they grew weary of being assaulted and jailed and sought more effective tactics. ALF migrated to the U.S. in the early 1980s and is now an international movement in over twenty countries. ALF is a loosely associated collection of cells of people who go underground and violate the law on behalf of animals. They break and enter to rescue animals, and they also destroy property in order to prevent further harm done to animals and to weaken exploitation industries economically. Official ALF guidelines are: (1) to liberate animals from places of abuse; (2) to inflict economic damage to industries that profit from animal exploitation; (3) to reveal the horrors and atrocities committed against animals behind locked doors, and (4) to take all nece ssary precautions against harming any human or nonhuman animals. ALF claimed responsibility for the April, 2003, fire at an exotic meat market located in Lockport. The other terrorist group operating within Will County reported by law enforcement official s is a right - wing white supremacist group. In the recent past, they have staged rallies and demonstrations in support of their ideas. Potentially threatening incidents have occurred that involve transportation sites. These occurrences include photographic surveillance within Will County, bomb threats to locks and dams, suspicious aircraft flights, and suspicious individuals/vehicles identified within Illinois. Risk Characterization Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 164 complexes ar e developed, the threat and incident of a terrorist attack becomes more attractive, more probable. Specific threats of terrorism have not been made against any critical infrastructure within Will County. Federal officials have issued warnings of potential attacks against the chemical, oil and gas, nuclear, electrical power, and agricultural industries. International terrorist groups, such as al Qaeda, attempt to strike at poorly defended targets. They are determined to attack the U.S. homeland and se ek a way to disrupt the country's economic and military base. They most likely would use conventional weapons to cause contamination, disruption, and terror. Environmental activist groups are very active throughout Illinois. They have committed numerous criminal acts including arson and criminal damage to property. Groups, such as the Earth Liberation Front (EL F), target any commercial or industrial venture that would disrupt land, water, or other environmental features. They are highly organized and pr actice leaderless resistance principles. Members are hardcore fanatics some of who are accomplished arsonists, vandals, and saboteurs. Impact: High Damage to Buildings Bombs are terrorists' weapon of choice. Bombs, along with incendiary devices, can cause serious damage or destruction to buildings. Critical Facilities Terrorists are drawn to critical facilities. They are highly visible or vulnerable targets, which can attract attention to the terrorists' cause and instill fear into the public witnessing the act. Terrorists can damage or destroy these facilities with bombs or incendiary devices, but they also can disrupt the function of critical facilities by infiltrating the electronic infrastructure of these facilities. Cyberterrorism threatens the in ter-connected networks that regulate the flow of power, water, financial services, medical care, telecommunication networks, and transportation systems. Health and Safety The threat of harm to the health and safety of human beings is part of the psychol ogy of terrorism. The mere threat of harm may be sufficient for the terrorists to further their cause. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 165 Economic Impact Impairing the economic structure of a society can be the intent of the terrorist act. By damaging the business and critical infrastru cture directly or by threat, the terrorist gain the attention they seek to promote their cause. Future Occurrence Will County is vulnerable to terrorism. Its location in the Chicago metropolitan area and the infrastructure that supports the function of th at metropolitan area make it a potentially attractive target to terrorists. Transportation systems, manufacturing industries, power plants, pipeline systems, and entertainment venues are some of the potential targets that terrorists may to drawn to for pu blicizing their cause. Details of the critical infrastructure that may be at risk by terrorism can be found in the Will County Terrorism Vulnerability Assessment . Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 166 ENEMY ATTACK Hazard Characterization Enemy attack is any hostile action taken against th e United States by foreign forces that result in the destruction of military and/or civilian targets. It is conventional war as seen in WWII that could occur through accident, miscalculation, an irrational act, or a deliberate act. The attacking foreign forces are more clearly defined than in a terrorist attack. Foreign forces are identified as an organized government with military forces rather than a pocket of militants or extremists. The methods of attack could include explosives, nuclear arms, or ch emical or biological weapons. History No occurrence has occurred in the U.S. since September 11, 2001; however, all areas of the U.S. are at risk at any time for direct or secondary effects. Risk Characterization Explosives would be life threatening and damaging to public and private structures. Nuclear weapons would have devastating and far -reaching effects. The blast overpressure, fire, and radioactive fallout could affect millions of lives and completely destroy property and infrastructure. The effects of chemical and/or biological weapons would differ depending on the agent used. Chemical agents include blister, blood gases, lung irritants, and nerve agents. Biological weapons contain living organisms that can cause disease or death, but are d ependent on their ability to reproduce. The threat of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons is worrisome as their development and delivery systems are improved by Third World nations desiring more control. Impact: High Future Occurrence The events of September 11 th are evidence that the threat of enemy attack is real. Local law enforcement must work closely with State and Federal agencies to identify and coordinate response to potential threats from enemies. Local law enforcement must be watchful of individuals or groups who may be: Recording or monitoring activities; Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 167 Trying to obtain information about military operations; Testing security barriers or procedures; Acquiring supplies for use as weapons, uniforms, or other controlled item s; Acting suspiciously or appear ing to be out of place; Attempting dry or trial runs to test their plan of attack; or Deploying assets to be used in an attack. Potential targets within Will County are an army training facility, raceway venue, numerou s manufacturing/refining companies, and nuclear facilities that may draw the interest of an enemy. Careful observance of suspicious activities and coordination with Federal law enforcement may prevent attacks from happening in the future. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 168 PUBL IC HEALTH Hazard Characterization Public health issues typically bring to mind infectious disease epidemics. Up through the early 1900's, there was significant risk from diseases such as tuberculosis, typhoid fever, poliomyelitis, and measles. As the 1 900's progressed, research brought about better sanitation, medical care, immunization, and new drugs that reduced the risks of epidemics. As methods of prevention of serious diseases were discovered, public health services grew. Today, major epidemic s are uncommon but still exist as a threat. The increase in life expectancy during the 20 th century is largely due to improvements in child survival resulting from reductions in infectious disease mortality. Immunizations are the primary impetus for thes e reductions with others being the use of antibiotics, improvements in screening and testing guidelines, and improvements in diagnosis of infectious disease. However, infectious disease remains the major cause of illness, disability, and death in the U.S. Foodborne illness , encephalitis, West Nile disease, hepatitis, tuberculosis (TB), pneumonia, and influenza, among others, are potential threats to Will County's residents. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 169 Public Health Emergencies are defined as incidents that involve a widespread and/or severe epidemic, contamination, or other situations that present a danger to or otherwise negatively impact the general health and well being of the public. Though diseases that were life threatening years ago are now under control, unexpected source s of infection do occur and can spread before the source of the problem can be contained. The Will County Health Department is prepared for potential disease threats and monitors unusual or suspect symptoms. The Health Department and other healthcare providers (hospitals, TB clinic, private labs, etc.) evaluate many factors in its response to a disease threat, including the mode of transmission, the route of entry, and the commonality of victims. Indicators of unusual disease activity include: Rapidl y increasing disease incidence; Unusual increase in the number of people seeking care, especially with neurological, respiratory, dermal, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms; Higher attack rates among persons who had attendance at similar activities or events; Clusters of patients arriving from a single locale; Large numbers of rapidly fatal cases; Any patient presenting with symptoms and/or signs that suggest inhalation, ingestion, or dermal exposure to a toxic chemical agent; Increased utiliza tion of hotlines, such as \"Poison Control\"; Unusual age distribution for common diseases; Unexplained cluster of diseases or dead animals; or Unexplained evidence of disease or toxic exposure to the general environment, such as trees or plants. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 170 History As an example of how infections can spread, outbreaks of West Nile virus began to occur in the New York metropolitan area in the fall of 1999. The virus, transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito, has quickly spread across the country. The West Nile virus was first documented in Illinois in September of 2001. By the end of 2002, Illinois led the country with over 800 confirmed cases of West Nile virus in humans and sixty- three deaths. Eighteen of the confirmed cases occurred in Will County. A West Nile Response Plan was adopted by the Will County Health Department in June, 2002. During the 20th Century, the emergence of several new Influenza A virus subtypes caused three pandemics, all of which spread around the world within a year of being detected. Influenza A viruses still circulate today afte r being re -introduced into the human population in 1977. Both the Asian Flu and Hong Kong Flu pandemics were caused by viruses containing a combination of genes from a human influenza virus and an avian influenza virus. The Spanish Flu pandemic virus app ears to have an avian origin. Despite annual vaccinations, approximately 2,000 deaths occur in Illinois each year. The Spanish Flu [A (H 1N1)], 1918- 1919, caused the highest number of known influenza deaths. More than 500,000 people died in the United S tates, and up to 50 million people may have died worldwide. Many people died within the first few days after infection, and others died of secondary complications.

Fi rst identified in China in late February 1957, the Asian flu spread to the United States by June 1957. The Hong Kong Flu [A (H 3N2 The United States experienced its first wave of 2009 H1N1 activity in the spring of 2009, followed by a second wave in the fall, with the number of people infected peaking at the end of October. The novel influenza virus first caused illness in Mexico and then in the United States. It was not long after those initial reports that the \"swine flu,\" so named because it was related to a respiratory disease in pigs, was reported in Illinois and around the c ountry. Later renamed H1N1 flu, the virus was so prolific in its spread that by June , 2009, the World Health Organization signaled a global pandemic was underway. The first confirmed case of H1N1 flu in Illinois was reported in late April , 2009. Hundreds of cases of H1N1 flu followed and, for a period of time, the state had reported the highest number of cases in the U.S. Unlike seasonal flu, which is usually active in the fall and winter, H1N1 flu continued to circulate in the nation and in Illinois thr oughout the summer. )], 1968- 1969, caused about 34,000 deaths in the United States. This virus was first detected in Hong Kong in early 1968 and s pread to the United States later that year. Peak Month of Flu Activity: 1982 -83 through 2012 -13 Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 172 A second wave of H1N1 influenza began in the fall and the state's H1N1 caseload climbed to more than 2,500 cases and 79 deaths by the end of the 2009. The H1N1 influenza vaccine began arriving in Illinois in early October , 2009, and the state started vaccinations of those identified as most at risk of the novel flu. Complicating the H1N1 flu resurgence in the fall was the threat of seasonal flu, which typically occurs between October and April. Illinois usually records about 2,600 seas onal flu and pneumonia deaths per year, making it the 10th leading cause of death. Will County experienced two deaths from the H1N1 virus. Risk Characterization The common characteristic of most public health emergencies is that they adversely impact, or have the potential to adversely impact, a large number of people. Public health emergencies can be statewide, regional, or localized in scope and magnitude. These emergencies can occur as primary events by themselves, or they may be caused by another dis aster or emergency. Along with infectious diseases, natural, technological, and societal hazardous occurrences can pose secondary hazards that threaten the public's health. Storms, floods, earthquakes, chemical spills, nuclear accidents, and sabotage can damage infrastructure disabling water, power, transportation, and communication facilities. This can lead to contaminated water and food supplies, subject the population to extreme temperatures, expose people to deadly toxins or radiation, delay the receipt of medical equipment or supplies, or prevent the public from receiving information important to their safety. Assessment and planning are needed to identify public health concerns that could occur as a result of a hazard and to prepare mitigating steps to handle such concerns. It is through surveillance and population -based interventions that disease and injury are best prevented. Observation and monitoring systems are used to develop data related to health determinants. This information along with the process of developing policy options and planning are essential to prevent and avert community wide health problems before they spread. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 173 Potential Public Health Events West Nile Virus: Usually spread by mosquitoes, a mild case of this virus will mimic the flu, while a severe case is life threatening. No drugs or vaccines are available to treat West Nile Virus. The virus is present in Will County; however, most people fully recover from it. In more severe cases, intensive supportive therapy is indicated, often involving hospitalization, intravenous fluids, airway management, respiratory support (ventilator), prevention of secondary infections (pneumonia, urinar y tract), and good nursing care. Influenza: On average, 10- 20 percent of U.S. residents will contract the flu by person -to- person contact. This is commonly a result of respiratory droplets released during coughing and sneezing. Some of these influenza cases will be fatal. E ach year, the flu claims 36,000 American lives. Healthy adults are usually not at risk for serious complications. Typically, t he elderly, small children, those with weakened immune systems, and those affected WILL COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT STATISTICS Comm. Health Center Visits Water Supply Inspect.

Though, populations vulnerable to a specific influenza strain will vary. Vaccine is available each year for seasonal flu and vaccination is effective because the type of virus we are exposed to each winter can be reliably predicted. Pandemic: A pa ndemic is a disease that attacks or affects the population of an extensive area. This is sometimes an entire country or continent. Each year, different strains of influenza are labeled as potential pandemic threats. Pandemics occur three to four times a century and can take place any season. An influenza pandemic is a global outbreak of disease that occurs when a new Influenza A virus appears or \"emerges\" in the human population, causes serious illness, and spreads easily among people worldwide. Expe rts predict an infection rate of 25 to 50 percent of the population, depending on the severity of the virus strain. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 175 Pand emics are different from seasonal outbreaks or \"epidemics\" of influenza. Seasonal outbreaks are caused by subtypes of influenza viruse s that already circulate among people, whereas pandemic outbreaks are caused by new subtypes, by subtypes that have never circulated among people, or by subtypes that have not circulated among people for a long time. Pandemic influenza tends to occur in w aves. The reasons for multiple waves of varying impact are not precisely understood, but they probably include adaptation of the virus to its new host, demographic or geographic variation, seasonality, and the overall immunity of the population. P ast influenza pandemics have led to high levels of illness, death, social disruption, and economic loss. A vaccine against pandemic flu may not be available at the start of a pandemic. New types of viruses must be accurately identified, and producing an effectiv e vaccine may take six months. Swine and Pigs may be infected with influenza viruses that are different from human flu Avian Influenza: viruses. Swine flu viruses spread among pigs and - while rare - H5N1 is a highly pathogenic , highly disease causing, avian (bird) flu virus that has caused serious outbreaks in domestic poultry in parts of Asia and the Middle they can spread from pigs to people too. The Centers f or Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is concerned about a new flu virus that has been found in U.S. pigs and has infected people too. This virus is called H3N2v when it infects people. Most cases have happened in people exhibiting pigs at fairs. Expos ure to pigs, especially close contact with pigs, is the main risk factor for infection with this virus. While most illness has been mild, some people have been hospitalized. Avian flu affects birds and is transmitted most commonly to humans by birds or through an intermediate host. Human infections with avian influenza (AI, or \"bird flu\") are rare but do occur, most commonly after exposure to infected poultry (b ird-to-human spread). Limited person -to-person spread of bird flu is thought to have occurred rarely in th e past. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 176 East. Although H5N1 does not usually infect humans, nearly 600 cases of human cases of H5N1 have been reported from 15 countries since 2003. Most human cases of \"highly pathogenic\" H5N1 virus infection have occurred in people who had recent contact with sick or dead poultry that were infected with H5N1 viruses. About 60% of pe ople infected with the virus died from their illness. Unlike other types of flu, H5N1 usually does not spread between people. There have been no reported infections with these viruses in birds, poultry, or people in the United States. You cannot get infect ed with these viruses from properly handled and cooked poultry or eggs. Human infections with a new avian influenza virus, A (H7N9) , continue to be reported in China. The virus has been detected in poultry in China as well. While mild illness in human c ases has been seen, most patients have had severe respiratory illness and some people have died. No cases of H7N9 outside of China have been reported. Most important, however, is that this transmission not be sustained (ongoing). The new H7N9 virus has not been detected in people or birds in the United States. Coronaviruses: The name coronavirus comes from its appearance under the microscope - the viruses have a spiky or crown -like (corona) appearance. Until recently, SARS - CoV was the only member of t he coronavirus family known to cause death or severe respiratory disease in humans. The other viruses in this group cause mild upper -respiratory infections in humans and are associated with respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurologic diseases in animals . One reason that SARS -CoV might have been more lethal than other coronaviruses is that it appears to interfere with an enzyme system in humans that is critical for regulating body fluid balance. Therefore, the virus could disrupt normal functioning of t he lungs by blocking this enzyme system and allowing fluid to leak into the air sacs of the lungs, resulting in severe respiratory illness. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 177 A new member of the coronavirus family emerged in the fall of 2012 in the Arabian Peninsula. The new virus has bee n named Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS -CoV). Although MERS -CoV is distinct from SARS -CoV, the disease caused by the new virus Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is similar to SARS in that it causes a severe respiratory illness that can be fatal in humans. The first and vast majority of cases of MERS have occurred in Saudi Arabia . As of late July 2013, approximately 90 cases of MERS infection were reported to the WHO, with about half of the cases resulting in death. MERS -CoV app ears to spread between people who are in close contact. Hepatitis: A disease affecting the liver that can affect anyone. Hepatitis is usually spread by person- to-person contact. Three types are common to the U.S. - Hepatitis A, B, and C with B and C bein g most prevalent. Hepatitis A (HAV) is a liver disease that can affect anyone. It lasts from a few weeks to several months. It does not lead to chronic infection. Transmission may occur through i ngestion of fecal matter, even in microscopic amounts, from close person -to-person contact or ingestion of contaminated food or drinks. Hepatitis B (HBV) ranges in severity from a mild illness, lasting a few weeks (acute), to a serious long -term (chronic) illness that can lead to liver disease or liver cancer. Transmission is through contact with infected bodily fluids. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 178 Hepatitis C is caused by the Hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV infection sometimes results in an acute illness, but most often becomes a chronic condition that can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. HCV is spread by contact with the blood of an infected person. Foodborne Illness: Each year, 48 million people in the U.S. get sick from contaminated food. Common culprits include bacteria, parasites and viruses. Symptoms rang e from mild to serious. They include Upset stomach Abdominal cramps Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Fever Dehydration Harmful bacteria are the most common cause of foodborne illness. Foods may have some bacteria on them when you buy them. Raw meat may becom e contaminated during slaughter. Fruits and vegetables may become contaminated when they are growing or when they are processed. But it can also happen in your kitchen if you leave food out for more than 2 hours at room temperature or power outages knock out refrigeration units . Contamination: Water sources may become contaminated due to natural hazards. Flood, tornadoes/thunderstorms, ice storms, ice jams or melting ice, etc. can cause contaminated run -off from floods or debris to filter into water sour ces. Because of an extensive flood area and the speed and direction of ground water flow, wells may not be a safe source of water for many months after a flood. The well can become contaminated with bacteria or other contaminants. Using contaminated wate r for drinking, cooking, or bathing can cause severe illness. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 179 Waste water from malfunctioning septic tanks or chemicals seeping into the ground can contaminate the ground water even after well water is tested and found to be safe. It is necessary to ta ke long range precautions, including repeated testing, to protect the safety of drinking water. Bioterrorism: A Bioterrorism attack is the deliberate release of viruses, bacteria, or other germs (agents) used to cause illness or death in people, animals, or plants. These agents are typically found in nature, but it is possible that they could be changed to increase their ability to cause disease, make them resistant to current medicines, or to increase their ability to spread into the environment. Biolog ical agents can be spread through the air, through water, or in food. Terrorists may use biological agents because they can be extremely difficult to detect and do not cause illness for several hours to several days. Surveillance is the cornerstone for Bioterrorism and Pandemic Influenza Preparedness. Early recognition and reporting of any disease outbreak, along with rapid implementation of post- attack prophylaxis (preventive medicine/vaccination), are the two most critical means of reducing losses. In the event of a public health emergency, the Will County Pharmaceutical Distribution Plan provides a multi -jurisdictional response for mass distribution of pharmaceuticals (antibiotic medications) to the entirety of Will County and any other areas of re sponsibility. Agroterrorism: Agroterrorism is defined as \"the deliberate introduction of an animal or plant disease for the purpose of generating fear, causing economic losses, or undermining social stability.\" It represents a tactic to attack the economic stability of the United States. Killing livestock and plants or contaminating food can help terrorists cause economic crises in the agriculture and food industries. Secondary goals include social unrest and loss of confidence in government. Because it lacks the drama and spectacle of more common terrorist violence, such as bombings and murders, agroterrorism has remained a secondary Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 180 consideration, and no documented attacks in the homeland have occurred since 9/11. Within Will County, potential targets for agroterrorism exist through its farming and transportation industry Tuberculosis: Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious and potentially life -threatening disease caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis Surveillance of communicable disease and environmental disease being transmitted through the air. While it can affect any part of the body (such as the brain, the kidneys or the spine), TB usually affects the lungs. Although both preventable and curable, tuberculosis once was the leading cause of death in the United States. Today in Illinois, less th an 30 deaths a year are attributed to tuberculosis and the number of cases in the state has fallen more than 40 percent in the past 10 years, reaching an all -time low of 633 in 2003. Public Health Mitigation: Monitoring systems through schools and hospitals Biowatch, EpiX, and other surveillance tools Inspection of food handling facilities Testing of wells and septic systems Mosquito traps Public education Disease agents Prophylactic interve ntion (anti -viral medication, anti- biotics, and/or immunization if available) Safe food handling Boil water orders Sanitation, good hygiene and other protective measures Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 181 Emergency preparedness plans and resources to address protection, response, and recov ery issues Pandemic Influenza Plan Strategic National Stockpile - Mass Dispensing Plan Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) caches Mutual aid agreements with surrounding health departments and community partners Impact: Low Critical Facilities Critical fa cilities could be impacted because of the loss of people to run them by a widespread infectious agent occurring naturally or intentially/unintentially spread by terrorist, animals/insects, or people traveling the world . Between 15 -35 percent of the U.S. population could be affected by an influenza pandemic. Workers may be unable to work because they are ill, may die from the infection, or may need to care for infected family members. Accordingly, the ability of critical facilities to provide service will be seriously affected due to the severe reduction in workforce capacity. Health and Safety Many scientists believe it is only a matter of time until the next influenza pandemic occurs. The severity of the next pandemic cannot be predicted, but modeling s tudies suggest the impact of a pandemic on the United States could be substantial. In the absence of any control measures (vaccination or drugs), it has been estimated that in the United States, a \"medium -level\" pandemic could cause 89,000- 207,000 deaths, 314,000- 734,000 hospitalizations, 18- 42 million outpatient visits, and another 20 -47 million sick people. Immunizations are a cost -effective method in preventing infectious disease and childhood immunization programs provide a high return on investment. Routine childhood immunization schedule saves 33,000 lives, prevents 14 million cases of disease, reduces direct health care costs by $9.9 billion, and saves $33.4 billion in indirect healthcare costs. Economic Impact Trust for America's Health (TFAH)'s Ma rch 2007 report Pandemic Flu and Potential for U.S. Economic Recession finds a severe pandemic flu outbreak could result in the second worst recession Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 182 in the U.S. since World War II. The U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) could drop over 5.5 percent, leadi ng to an estimated $683 billion loss. Future Occurrence The probability of a widespread public health emergency is every 10 years or less. Minor outbreaks and incidents have the potential to occur more frequently. Will County is a major hub for transport ation of raw materials and products and a potential method for transporting in an infectious agent. New infectious diseases continue to be detected and infectious disease must be studied in a global context because of increased international travel and mi gration, import of foods and agricultural practices, and continued threat of bioterrorism. Public health emergencies typically occur on a regional basis. Sources include infected animals, contaminated food, and improperly prepared food. While the whole C ounty is vulnerable to a public health emergency, the source of the infection may be a farm or restaurant. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 183 CIVIL DISTURBANCE Hazard Characterization Civil disturbances are incidents that intend to disrupt a community to the degree that police interventio n is required to maintain public safety. Civil disturbances can include prison or institutional rebellions, disruptive political gatherings, violent labor disputes, urban protests or riots, demonstrations, or problems at large -scale events resulting in po lice intervention and arrests. Civil disturbances can occur anytime but tend to be more frequent during summer months when the hot, humid weather places a stress on the public. The threat from a disturbance varies by the type, severity, and range of the event. Public welfare and property are at risk along with infrastructure services such as electricity, water supply, public transportation, communications, etc. Government buildings, universities, military bases, nuclear power plants, and correctional f acilities tend to be targeted the most. As the profile of Will County points out, Will County has all of these types of facilities and entities. Thus, preparation to effectively deal with civil disturbances is important. History No documentation of recent civil disturbances is available. Risk Characterization The economic impact to urban areas during civil unrest and following such events can be profound. Direct impacts include looting and smashed windows as well as endangering shop owners and customers. Indirect economic impacts result from the loss of business when potential customers do not approach businesses for extended periods of time. Customer impressions and habits can change from the experience of a single threatening event. Civil Disturbances or Demonstrations can be identified in three (3) categories: P eaceful, Non -Obstructive Demonstrations Non -Violent, Disruptive Demonstrations Violent, Disruptive Demonstrations Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 184 The severity of civil disturbance depends on the nature of the disturbance. A localized civil disturbance involving a small segment of the population, for instance, workers who chose to strike and establish a picket line, or some other small scale demonstration, would have a low severity rating. In the instance of a low severity civil disturbance, police might be called upon to e nsure that protestors did not block traffic corridors or intrude on private property. A moderately severe civil disturbance would be one wherein the protests disrupt nearby businesses and possibl y cause some property damage. In this instance, police intervention would be required to restore order without employing chemical agents or physical force. A severe civil disturbance would involve rioting, arson, looting, and assault. Civil disturbance can, in extreme cases, cause extensive social disruption, loss of jobs, death, and property damage. These may result either from those involved in the action or initiated by those in higher authority in response to what they perceive as a threat to either the status quo or their own authority. In addition, the government may also curtail certain civil liberties even to the eventual imposition of martial law. Looting and general vandalism are the most common activities associated with civil disturbance. Arson is also quite common and can quickly spread due to slow response times of overwhelmed fire departments. Transportation routes can become blocked making it difficult for non- rioters to leave the area and difficult for the emergency response personnel to arrive. Long- term effects may include a local depressed economy, environmental damage, social disruption, and long lasting animosity between the contending groups. Impact: Low Damage to Buildings Buildings and property can be damaged or destroyed by participants of civil disturbances or fire if it ensues. Critical Facilities Disruption of services such as electricity, water supply, public transportation, communications, etc., could result from civil disorder. Health and Safety Injury and loss of lif e can occur as a result of civil disturbance. Will County Emgerncy Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 4: Hazard Profiles & Vulnerability Assessment November, 2013 Chapter 4 - 185 Economic Impact Loss of life and property as well as fear can be a factor and interrupt the normal functioning of a community. The need for increased security for sites vulnerable to civil disorder places dem ands on local law enforcement organizations. Future Occurrence The occurrence of civil disorder is always a possibility, but the likelihood is low. The potential for civil disturbances exists within Will County because of: Large manufacturing enterpri ses and labor organizations that could result in public demonstration over labor disputes; Will County Jail, River Valley Juvenile Detention Center, and Stateville Correctional facilities that could face uprisings due to overcrowding or jail conditions ; Three universities and a junior college that could experience student demonstrations or crowd disturbances; or Radical groups , such as the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) and a right -wing white supremacist group that are known to exist in the count y. Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 5: Mitigation Goals, Objectives, and Strategies November, 2013 Chapter 5 - 1 CHAPTER 5 : MITIGATION GOALS, OBJECTIVES , & STRATEGIES Will County E mergency Management Agency (EMA) , with the collaboration of participating jurisdictions, have identified the expectations of the Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan and the strategies to meet these goals and objectives . The expectations of this planning document are defined as the M itigation Goals and Objectives. The mitigation p lan's goals are broad statements that describe the principles that will guide the suggested mitigation . The objectives are targeted statements that define strategies and implementation procedures to attain the mitigation plan's goals. The Committee developed the goals, objectives, and strategies based upon the findings of the All Hazard Risk Assessment, previously prepared by the County, individual expertise, knowledge of existing and planned county- wide programs and projects, and collaboration with participating jurisdictions . The Mitigation Steering Committee held a workshop on October 10, 2013, with participating jurisdictions to review and update , further define , and finalize the goals and objectives originally established in 2008. Goals and Objectives Goal #1: Protect and secure life and property . Objectives: Increase public education and awareness of all hazards and what they can do to protect and secure their community. Implement effective approaches to protect neighborhoods, buildings, and critical facilities and infrastructure from all hazards. Nurture and support local and r egional organizations that have mission s that fulfill this goal. Increase capabilities to disseminate pre -event and post -event information . Increase readiness of the public and all levels of government within Will County .

Objectives: Incorporate hazard mitigation practices into the activities of other County departments and Will County jurisdictions. Integrate mitigation actions into existing and future opportunities, projects, and developments. Focus on flood hazard mitigation actions that c an increase open space and meet targets for natural environment sustainability. Mitigation Implementation Strategies The Mitigation Implementation Strategies section of this plan addresses the action plan to reduce loss from future hazard events throughou t Will County . The specific projects, responsible agencies, potential funding sources, and priorities are listed in the pages that follow. Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 5: Mitigation Goals, Objectives, and Strategies November, 2013 Chapter 5 - 4 Prioritization Mitigation strategies were defined and prioritized primarily through a formalized workshop with participating jurisdictions . The initial selection and prioritization of these strategies was drafted by the mitigation project planning team , using the following criteria to identify mitigation strategies and actions that: Address the plan's goals and objec tives. Take advantage of opportunities presented by on- going or future initiatives, programs, and activities related to emergency management, public safety, homeland security, planning, growth management, community development, transportation, utilities, a nd other capital improvements, facilities maintenance, code revisions, and other programs to build mitigation opportunities into on -going functions of government to the maximum extent possible. Are within the capabilities of Will County and/or local jurisdiction that find the mitigation strategy and action to be pertinent to their locale to execute the mitigation action. Offer a significant benefit in relation to its cost. Have an identified funding source or sources. Have an identified lead agency with app ropriate jurisdictional authority to coordinate implementation. Have an identified schedule for implementation. The team devised a worksheet (Appendix D ) to organize all mitigation ideas and priorities. The participant s were encouraged to identify mitigat ion strategies that had an all -hazards approach and that targeted select hazards that were determined to have a significant risk to communities in Will County. The participants were persuade d to consider evaluatio n criteria as indicated in the State and L ocal Mitigation Planning How -To-Guides developed by FEMA. These evaluation criteria consist of public support, technical feasibi lity, staffing, funding, maintenance requirements, political support, legal authority, and cost effectiveness. Information fro m these worksheets is incorporated into the matrix shown on pages 5- 13 through 5- 20. Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 5: Mitigation Goals, Objectives, and Strategies November, 2013 Chapter 5 - 5 A detailed benefit -cost analysis (BCA) was not conducted during the mitigation strategy development phase. A detailed BCA will be done at the time that the mitigation action strategy's defined scope of work is developed and supported. Although the benefits of a mitigation action can be determined, an accurate cost c ould not be determined at this meeting because of too many unknown variables. Integrating Mitigation Some of the mitigation strategies suggested are more accurately defined as preparedness, response, and recovery actions. Although the purpose of a hazard mitigation plan is to address mitigation actions, the communities of Will County recognized the importance o f integrating overlapping functions of all phases of emergency management. The preparedness, response, and recovery actions identified support the goals and objectives of this plan. Although FEMA mitigation funds may not be able to fund these actions, th e communities of Will County consider these actions a s important in achieving the overall goal s and objective s of this plan. Will County EMA also recognizes that hazard risks, vulnerabilities, and disasters often transcend beyond political boundaries. Therefore, the plan also addresses strategies for long term planning and coordination purposes as neighboring jurisdictions develop hazard mitigation plans. The results of this plan will be incorporated into ongoing planning efforts for Will County and its jurisdictions. Funding opportunities to implement a variety of the mitigation action items identified in the plan are identified within each mitigation action item found on pages 6 -5 thru 6 -35 in Chapter 6. Funding avenues for these action items varies de pendent on the potential funding opportunities and the identified responsible organizations. The identified Mitigation Action Items and Goals within the Will County All - Hazards Mitigation Plan will be integrated into the following ongoing planning efforts when applicable. Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 5: Mitigation Goals, Objectives, and Strategies November, 2013 Chapter 5 - 6 PLANNING ELEMENTS National Response Framework Establishes the framework for Federal, State, and local emergency planning addressing preparedness, response, mitigation, and recovery efforts.

Mitigation Actions November, 2013 Chapter 6 - 1 CHAPTER 6 : MITIGATION ACTIONS Overview The communities of Will County have numerous natural, technological, and societal hazards that pose a threat to the residents, busine sses, infrastructure, property, and community assets. Identifying and prioritizing mitigation actions are the fundamental component of the Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan . Analyzing mitigation actions that address all or multiple hazards will improve the effectiveness and benefits . However, mitigation actions that address one hazard category (i.e., natural hazards) or a specific hazard ( flooding ) are also identified in this section . A cost -benefit analysis was not developed due to the open scope of many of these items. A cost -benefit analysis based on FEMA's methodology will be developed when the actions are implemented. The cost benefit analysis will help in prioritizing actions by describing appropriate benefit -cost methodologies for evaluating the effectiveness of a range of potential mitigation actions. As a result, mitigation actions are prioritized by whether they address the target hazards identified in the risk assessment or by the number of hazards that they address . To comple ment state initiatives, mitigation actions that address relative \"National Priorities \", as dictated by DHS doctrines, are also identified . The intent of this section is to identify actions that will accurately artic ulate the communities of Will County 's needs for mitigating the consequence of high risk event s and to improve emergency services . Common Themes and Issues Rapid Growth and Urban Sprawl Will County is one of the Nation's fastest growing counties . Between 1990 and 2010, Will County's population grew by 89% or over 320,000 people. Annual estimates and future projections show this rapid growth trend will continue with population totals exceeding 1.1 million people. Currently there is a population of 682,518, which makes Will County's population the fourth largest in the state and the 89th largest in the country. This rapid growth makes Will County the second fastest developing county in Illinois. Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 6. Mitigation Actions November, 2013 Chapter 6 - 2 The nation has witnessed an alarming increase in the number and severity of natural disasters. Experts believe that this trend will continu e, with the potential of larger and more devastating disaster s occurring . While geophysical disasters, such as earthquakes, have remained relatively constant in this country over the past 50 years, weather -related disasters have skyrocketed. In addition, our technological advances have further increased our vulnerabilities and potential for impacts are exacerbated with the growing presence of societal hazards such as terrorism. Population growth and urbanization are major contributors to a community's increase in vulnerability, as well as exacerb ating the potential impacts of a disaster . Urban sprawl and our desire to control our environment with engineered structures have led to more development in high -risk areas. This encouragemen t of developing high -risk areas, coupled with aging infrastructure, makes the potential impact of a disaster even greater. In addition, growing populations combined with increased risks require a greater need for identifying evacuation routes. Larger populations and a higher c oncentration of people living in urban areas will result in disasters that affect a larger number of individuals. One of the Will County's greatest risks is flooding. 'No Adverse Impact Floodplain Management' is a managing principle being offered by the Association of State Floodplain Managers (ASFPM) that is easy to communicate and from a policy perspective tough to challenge. In essence , a no impact floodplain is one where the action of one property owner does not adversely impact the rights of other properties, as measured by increased flood peaks, flood stage, flood velocity, and erosion and sedimentation potentials. While Will County participates in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) guidelines, many structures remain at risk simply because they are in the floodplain. By joining the Community Rating System (CRS), the C ounty : Will reduce insurance premiums of those policy holders located in the floodplain. Would have a process in place to enable the County to tailor future development . Woul d better allow communities to incorp orate environmental concerns in to floodplain management. Digital Flood Insurance Rate Maps (DFIRM) for Will County is expected to be completed in 2015 providing a digital version of the FEMA flood insurance rate maps de signed for use with digital mapping and analysis software. Flood Insurance Studies (FIS) date back to the late 1970's and early 1980's. As a Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 6. Mitigation Actions November, 2013 Chapter 6 - 3 result, the flood elevations associated with various flood events may not be indicative of expected flood inundat ion. This discrepancy , coupled with the current increase in population density, will be resolved when final DFIRMS are available . Similarly, the location and conditions of Will County non -federal dams should be assessed since increased population density downstream of a dam could result in increased destruction during a dam failure. Local and Regional Partnerships Like all emergency management functions, hazard mitigation begins at the local level. Individual properties and businesses can be the most vuln erable to hazards. Therefore, it is important for businesses, industry representatives, and local governments to form partnerships and work together to plan for disasters. This partnership would create a more thorough response and init iate the framework and resources needed for post -disaster recovery. Partnerships will bring mitigation into the forefront. Development of local and regional partnerships was identified by FEMA as a National Priority. Crisis Management vs. Consequence Management Since Septe mber 11th \"Any action taken to eliminate or reduce long -term risk to human life and property from the consequences of natural and human- caused hazards\". Such actions are taken to reduce the consequences of disasters and break the vicious cycle of destruction, repair, , there has been much debate on the roles and responsibilities of emergency management . Although there is a close relationship between crisis and consequence management, there are defined differences. Crisis management is predominately a law enf orcement function and include s measures to identify , acquire , and plan the use of resources needed to anticipate, prevent and/or resolve a threat or act of terrorism. Consequence management is predominately an emergency management function and includes measures to protect public health and safety, restore essential government services, and provide emergency relief to governments, businesses, and individuals affected by the consequence s of an event. For this reason, the hazard mitigation actions are focuse d on alleviating the impacts or consequences of a hazard, whether it is a natural or man- made event. By definition, mitigation actions are: Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 6. Mitigation Actions November, 2013 Chapter 6 - 4 destruction, repair, etc. Mitigation actions are the foundation of a truly effective emergency m anagement progr am.\" Leveraging Available Funds In recent years, the financial resource s for mitigation activities ha ve declined with the reduction in funds for the FEMA Pre-Disaster Mitigation Program (PDM) and the Hazard Mitigation Grant P rogram (HMGP) . However, leveraging Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) initiatives to address natural, technological, and societal hazards, as well as potentially funding mi tigation actions , will ensure effici ency in public funding. The 2005 Emergency Management Performance Grants - Program Guidance an d Application Kit states that \" emergency managers at all levels should leverage all available funding and resources from multiple sources wherever possible...(and)...should not restrict their activities to only Federal funding to achieve the goals outlined within their strategies. Rather, special attention should be given to leveraging relevant funding sources and resources that support\"... mitigation activities.1 1 \"The Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, & Emergency Managem ent Hearing on The National Preparedness Syste m: What are we preparing for?\" April 14, 2005. Additional sources include other Federal preparedness programs, those offered by Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) through CDC, Department of Health and Human Services ( HRSA) , and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; the Department of Agriculture; the Department of Justice (DOJ); the Department of Transportation; FEMA; DHS Science and Technology Directorate; DHS Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate; and other relevant organizations . In addition to federal programs, State homeland security and preparedness programs and resources may be availabl e to meet the objectives outlined in the Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan . Regardless of the mitigation activities and the corresponding jurisdictions and potential funding mechanisms that have been identified, it is not the intent of thi s plan to convey any specific commitment or obligation to carry out a specific project. I t is understood that the completion of mitigation actions identified in this plan are contingent upon further planning and review, specific endorsement or approval from appropriate agencies and governing bodies, and financial, technical, and other necessary resources. http://www.house.gov/transportation/pbed/04 -14-05/04- 14- 05memo.html Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 6.

Problem/Opportunity: Will County is one of the Nation's fastest growing communities. Population growth and urbanization are major contributors to a community's increase in vulnerability, as well as exacerbates the potential impacts of a disaster. Urban sprawl and our desire to control our environment with engineered structures have led to more development in high-risk areas. Implementation Strategy: Support, promote, and expand the development of the Hazard Mitigation Steering Committee into a perm anent component throughout the C ounty. Implement annual workshops and roundtables to educate others on the need for and benefits of mitigation, identify opportunities, and integrate developments into revis ions of the All Hazard Mitigation Plan along with local plans and ordinances .

Mitigation Actions November, 2013 Chapter 6 - 9 Mitigation Action #5: Expand the county- wide public awareness and education programs and promote the understanding of each community's risks, vulnerabilities, what to do during and after a disaster, and how to mitigate the effects of disasters. Goals Addressed: Goal #1 - Protect and secure life and property. Goal #2 - Continue to improve and enhance county- wide emergency management programs and develop relationships county- wide. Goal #3 - Ensure economic stability, preserve cultural resources, and improve quality of life throughout Will County. Goal #4 - Develop, promote, and integrate mitigation actions. Problem/Opportunity: When a disaster occurs, it affect s everyone living in the community. Therefore, it is essential to ensure public awareness of the community's threats and what they can do to prepare and measures they can take to reduce the consequences of a disaster. During and after a hazard event, emergency responders may be either overwhelmed with emergency calls or unable to access some residential areas. It is important that individual households are prepared for a period of self -sufficiency while responders deal with more immediate and life -threat ening situations. Disasters also open a window of opportunity following a disastrous event of local, national or international significance in which citizens will take action to improve their own safety and preparedness. This strategy supports response and recovery. Implementation Strategy: Evaluate existing public education efforts and identify opportunities to expand or develop new programs that present the risks that face the community and measures they can take to prepare and mitigate. Leverage existing forums such as public meetings, universities, and workshops to deliver these programs. Develop and index a mitigation/preparedness packet for the public and for the media to have ready for each type of hazard. Following a disaster, provide rapid information to the public on disaster preparedness and mitigation measures. Follow up with sustained education campaign for the following two months. Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 6. Mitigation Actions November, 2013 Chapter 6 - 10 Develop customized recovery packets for each hazard for delivery to the public and media to have ready for when a disaster occurs. Draft a campaign strategy to deploy the information strategically. Expand current advertising/public service announcements (PSA) outlet information.

Goal #3 - Ensure economic stability, preserve cultural resources, and improve quality of life throughout Will County. Goal #4 - Develop, promote, and integrate mitigation actions. Goal #5 - Take advantage of opportunities of fered by growth while also protecting natural systems and resources. Problem/Opportunity: It is essential to have political and peer support prior to, during, and following a disaster by establishing, cultivating, and maintaining relationships throughout t he County, between communities, local officials and department liaisons prior to an event. In addition, the field of Emergency Management has grown rapidly over the past few decades. The challenges and complexities of the relationship between our environment, global politics and their impacts on our infrastructure, economics, and sustainability have required the need for a vast array of specialty. Implementation Strategy: Continue county- wide emergency management workshops and training for communities, department liaisons and local officials that focuses on their community's risks, vulnerabilities, and opportunities to protect and mitigate. Also, encourage and support emergency management and other related professionals throughout the County to obtain higher education degrees, certifications, and membership in professional organizations.

Goals Addressed: Goal #1 - Protect and secure life and property. Goal #2 - Continue to improve and enhance county- wide emergency management programs and develop relationships county- wide. Goal #3 - Ensure ec onomic stability, preserve cultural resources, and improve quality of life throughout Will County. Goal #4 - Develop, promote, and integrate mitigation actions. Goal #5 - Take advantage of opportunities offered by growth while also protecting natural syst ems and resources. Problem/Opportunity: The flood modeling conducted in this report identified several fire stations and schools that were located within or near the 100 year floodplain. NFIP regulations encourage communities to have critical facilities outside of the 500 year floodplain. FEMA now provides the Standard Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) Database which is a digital version of the FEMA flood insurance rate map that is designed for use with digital mapping and analysis software. Wil l County is expected to receive their DFIRMs in the near future which will allow planners to more accurately identify criti cal facilities located in flood -prone areas. Implementation Strategy: Upon receipt of updated DFIRM database provided by FEMA, c onduc t a detailed study of each facility to evaluate the potential impacts to each facility and identify mitigation options to protect it from future damages and to ensure operations during an event. Conduct a benefit -cost analysis and implement the best mitig ation alternative.

Goals Addressed: Goal #1 - Protect and secure life and property. Goal #2 - Continue to improve and en hance county- wide emergency management programs and develop relationships county -wide. Goal #4 - Develop, promote, and integrate mitigation actions. Problem/Opportunity: Will County communities are increasingly incorporating geospatial technologies and d ata into their daily operations. Geospatial technologies and data have become a valued asset in preparedness, protection, response, and recovery emergency management operations. In the preparedness phase, emergency management planners, as well as responders, need current, accurate, and easily accessible information to ensure the readiness of teams to respond. The mapping and analysis of critical infrastructure vulnerabilities and public health surveillance capabilities is an important component of strat egy development including response and recovery in order to provide a dynamic common operating picture, coordinate and track emergency assets, enhance capabilities, understand event impacts, accurately estimate damage, locate safety zones for quarantine or detention, and facilitate recovery. Through the mitigation planning process, the Will County communities have identified the benefit of integrating HAZUS technology and the benefits of robust, accurate, and detailed data. Implementation Strategy: Continue to e ncourage communities to invest in GIS technology by training staff, obtaining and updating detailed geospatial data, and incorporating GIS technology and modeling programs into community decisions. D ata sharing agreements have been made with twenty -eight communities throughout Will County along with many other tax districts and agencies .

Goals Addressed: Goal #1 - Protect and secure life and property. Goal #2 - Continue to improve and enhance count y-wide emergency management programs and develop relationships county -wide. Goal #4 - Develop, promote, and integrate mitigation actions. Goal #5 - Take advantage of opportunities offered by growth while also protecting natural systems and resources. Problem/Opportunity: Current development is based on outdated BFE's determined in the late 1970's and early 1980's. These outdated flood maps may not adequately represent present flood inundation levels for areas with increased urban and commercial developme nt. Continuing development based on current BFE's may result in an increased negative impact. Additionally, many areas impacted will likely not possess flood insurance due to their expectations of the base flood elevation.

Goal #5 - Take advantage of opportunities offered by growth while also protecting natural systems and resources. Problem/Opportunity: Will County GIS Division is currently working closely with jurisdictions to improve GIS capabilities and develop measures to protect communities from flooding. County -wide GIS capabilities have been steadily increasing; however, there is a limitation in the amount of data available. The County would like to utilize the existing technology and to leverage FEMA's current Risk Map Program initiative to map flood hazards. The Risk Map Program will: Create new maps that take advantage of revised data and improved technol ogies for identifying flood hazards. Create up -to-date maps to support a flood insurance program that is more closely aligned with actual risk, encourage wise floodplain management, and increase the public's flood hazard awareness. Provide local communitie s and various stakeholders desired more timely updates of floodplain maps and easier access to the data. Map Modernization is a cornerstone for helping communities to be better prepared for flood disasters. The NFIP currently serves 4.5 million policyholde rs and provides $650 billion in coverage.

Goal #3 - Ensure economic stability, preserve cultural resources, and improve quality of lif e throughout Will County. Goal #4 - Develop, promote, and integrate mitigation actions. Goal #5 - Take advantage of opportunities offered by growth while also protecting natural systems and resources. Problem/Opportunity: As budgets shrink and the need g rows for managing mitigation and recovery projects within rapidly growing communities, efficiency in managing information on flood prone areas is essential. GIS provides management of data and mapping capabilities that allows analysis of the information f or planning, mitigation, and recovery purposes . Mitigation funding of approximately $10.6 million has been spent in securing repetitive loss properties in Will County from the 1996 and 2008 floods. Data on flood controlled areas, previously purchase d flood plain properties, and flood prone properties to be purchased can be integrated into useable formats for planners. This will improve efficiency in flood plain management projects and maximize limited budgets. Implementation Strategy: Use improved GIS capabilities and completed DFIRMs for Will County when available to integrate flood plain data on flood controlled areas, purchased flood plain properties, and flood prone properties to be acquired. This will allow planners to be more efficient in data a nalysis and budgeting for planning, mitigation, and recovery projects.

Mitigation Actions November, 2013 Chapter 6 - 21 Mitigation Action #15: Continue stormwater management planning and ordinances to improve existing storm capacity and drainage systems . Utilize watershed studies and mapping to identify and prioritize mitigation needs in each wate rshed. Potential projects include r etention , stream maintenance , erosion/sedimentation control , water quality assessment, watershed and flood risks education , infrastructure maintenance , agency coordinat ion, property /infrastructure protection, roadway elevations correction, and data for improved emergency planning/response. Goals Addressed: Goal #1 - Protect and secure life and property. Goal #4 - Develop, promote, and integrate mitigation actions. Goal #5 - Take advantage of opportunities offered by growth while also protecting natural systems and resources. Problem/Opportunity: Current watershed concerns have been identified through existing studies, community recommendations, and past flood incide nt data. There is a concern that some of the drainage systems throughout the County are undersized due to the rapid development within the County from rural farm fields to suburbanized communities. As the County developed, farm field tiles that once cont rolled flooding were abandoned as developments were built on neighboring land. Growing communities increase the need for effective stream maintenance, proper sizing of retention basins and culverts, erosion/sedimentation control, and protection of propert y and infrastructure from flooding. Watershed studies would assist the WCSMPC to identify, prioritize, and address flooding issues; thus, these studies would provide a cost -effective approach to addressing existing and future flood problems. Staffing and funding are obstacles for the development of the studies and implementing recommended flood control measures . Implementation Strategy: Utilize Will County Stormwater Plan and Technical Guidance to: Employ studies by a licensed professional engineer to re-evaluate watersheds and determine the true flood areas and issues causing flooding . Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 6. Mitigation Actions November, 2013 Chapter 6 - 22 Assess problematic areas where field tiles were once the primary method of flood control . Perform an enhancement capability assessment of the stormwater facility to handle the increase of flood waters . Have the stormwater facilities fixed or re -sized to the appropriate capacity .

Mitigation Actions November, 2013 Chapter 6 - 23 Mitigation Action #16: Complete and maintain maps of shallow flooding and urban ponding areas to prioritize stormwater infrastructure improvements. Goals Addressed: Goal #1 - Protect and secure life and property. Goal #4 - Develop, promote, and integrate mitigation actions. Goal #5 - Take advantage of op portunities offered by growth while also protecting natural systems and resources. Problem/Opportunity: Some areas throughout the County are subject to flooding that occurs as a result of poor drainage rather than proximity to a river or stream. Major developments have been constructed in these shallow flooding areas and more are proposed. Flooding can occur well outside of mapped floodplains and the number of flood insurance policy holders outside of identified flood -prone areas demonstrates the need to map shallow flooding areas. Identifying shallow flooding areas would help reduce future problems and future surprises to residents, and provide a prioritized list of needed capital improvements. Tools, such as GIS and Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) maps, are available to identify shallow flooding areas. Implementation Strategy: Identify past occurrences of shallow flooding, urban ponding, and high ground water areas using LIDAR and county- wide aerial photography of historical floods. Incorporate th ese into flood maps to monitor and prioritize infrastructure improvements throughout the County.

Mitigation Actions November, 2013 Chapter 6 - 24 Mitigation Action #17: Increase open space and conservation easements, as well as incorporate natural features, in high flood hazard areas throughout the County. Goals Addressed: Goal #1 - Protect and secure life and property. Goal #4 - Develop, promote, and integrate mitigation actions. Goal #5 - Take advantage of opportunities offered by growth while also protecting natural systems and resources. Problem/Opportunity: Extensive new dev elopment could greatly alter the natural hydrology throughout the County. Each new development adds impervious surfaces, such as sidewalks, driveways, foundations or others. This means that, because less water filters through the ground and into the wate r table, more rain drains more rapidly into stormwater management systems, streams and rivers. This situation increases the risk of flooding, adds sediment and toxins to run off, and slows aquifer replenishment. Furthermore, the cumulative affect of rapi d growth throughout the County degrades environmental quality and increases the risk of flooding. Low impact development (LID) has the potential to alleviate these adverse impacts through the creation of appropriately placed green space, landscaping, gra ding, streetscapes, roads and parking lots. LID can achieve multifunctional objectives and help to reduce stormwater impacts, and provide and maintain the beneficial hydrologic functions of a natural drainage system. Implementation Strategy: Coordinate e xisting Will County Stormwater Management Plan into overall flood hazard mitigation activities. This could achieve several objectives: Ensure coordination of other planning efforts with those of the Will County Stormwater Management Plan Committee. Ensure coordination with the Will County Stormwater Management Planning Committee on issues pertaining to floodplain development, stormwater control, and other related matters. Ensure a wider understanding of and adherence to the Stormwater Management Plan and S tormwater Ordinance. Coordinate and implement efforts to increase open spa ce in high hazard areas through out the County with the Will County Land Use Plan. The use of LID could achieve several objectives: Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 6. Mitigation Actions November, 2013 Chapter 6 - 25 LID measures can result in no net increase in run off thereby maintaining the current flood risk without affecting development potential . It recharges the aquifer. Groundwater supplies at least 95% of the drinking water supply and water critical for commerce in Will County. It supports the hydrologic regime, in turn supporting a healthy ecosystem and demanding less cost for maintenance and energy . It results in open space. Develop county/jurisdiction regulations and guidelines that implement LID objectives to: Minimize impacts to the extent practicable b y reducing imperviousness, conserving natural resources and ecosystems, maintaining natural drainage courses, reducing the use of pipes and minimizing clearing/grading. Recreate detention and retention storage dispersed and evenly distributed throughout a site with the use of open swales, fatter slopes, depressions, storage rain gardens (bio -retention), water use (rain barrels) and others. Maintain the predevelopment time of concentration by strategically routing flows to maintain travel time. Provide eff ective public education and socioeconomic incentives to ensure property owners use effective pollution prevention measures and maintain management measures.

Goal #4 - Develop, promote, and integrate mitigation actions. Goal #5 - Take advantage of opportunities offered by growth while also protecting natural systems and resources. Problem/Opportunity: FEMA is currently updating digital flood maps in Will County that should be av ailable soon . The new DFIRMS will be overlai d onto aerial photographs identify ing structures that are within a flood zone providing information for mitigation opportunities. Implementation Strategy: Identify structures within the flood zones and evaluate these locations for accuracy. Often flood maps do not reflect changes of the site due to new development, new elevations caused by placed fill, or flood control and stormwater infrastructure. Compare the findings of the strategy above to existing inven tory of repetitive loss structures. Educate the public of this risk and promote potential opportunities to mitigate such as buy -out programs, relocation, or elevation.

Goals Addressed: Goal #1 - Protect and secure life and property. Goal #2 - Continue to improve and enhance county- wide emergency management programs and develop relationships county -wide. Goal #4 - Develop, promote, and integrate mitigation actions. Problem/Opportunity: Will County has improved its flood monitoring resources to assist in notifying communities quickly and accurately of a flood threat. A flood warning system may consist of people or machines monitoring water level with stream gauges. Although a flood warning system d oes not provide long term damage reduction, it can alleviate health and safety risk by providing citizens time to remove belongings that could be damaged. Additionally, Will County has successfully issued approximately 800 NOAA weather radios throughout t he County as part of improving the emergency communication system. Implementation Strategy: Continue to expand flood warning system s that monitor water levels of rivers, streams, creeks, and othe r bodies of water that threaten properties throughout the C ounty and incorporate these systems into the county- wide emergency communication strategy .

Goals Addressed: Goal #1 - Protect and secure life and property. Goal #4 - Develop, promote, and integrate mitigation actions. Goal #5 - Take advantage of opportunities offered by growth while also protecting natural systems and resources. Problem/Opportuni ty: The exponential growth throughout the County has resulted in the inadequacies of providing enough shelter space. Community recreational and residential parks, golf courses, and nature preserves do not have adequate shelters for residents during a seve re storm or tornado. Furthermore, many of the public buildings, schools, and critical facilities were built before advancements in shelter construction. Temperature extremes occasionally require the need to provide heating or cooling centers for public use, particularly for populations most susceptible to temperature extremes. Mobile home parks and manufactured home communities are vulnerable to high winds and tornados. Implementation Strategy: Encourage and support the i ncrease of shelters through the constructi on of dual use, multi -hazard shelters in the community's most popular parks, golf courses, and other public venues. Community facilities should incorporate technological advancements for shelter ing purposes and double as heating and cooling cente rs during severe temperatures. Evaluate the existing shelters in public buildings county -wide to determine needs and improvements necessary to adequately shelter inhabitants during a storm or tornado.

Goals Addressed: Goal # 1 - Protect and secure life and property. Goal #2 - Continue to improve and enhance count y-wide emergency management programs and develop relationships county- wide. Goal #3 - Ensure economic stability, preserve cultural resources, and improve quality of life throughout Will County. Problem/Opportunity: Will County has many oil refineries, chem ical manufacturers, and other businesses that use hazardous materials in their processing. Chemicals and materials in use vary in toxicity. There are a large number of known facilities that store large quantities of reportable hazardous materials that are required for their industrial process. Communities should be aware of the hazardous materials being used for industrial processes within their jurisdiction. By working together, industry and communities can coordinate emergency plans to identify the location of facilities, transportation routes of hazardous materials, procedures for immediate response, a community- wide evacuation plan, a public notification plan, facility point of contacts, and a plan for exercising simulations. Implementation Strategy: Continue to s upport efforts to assess and monitor Tier II facility release contingency plans by using geospatial data to help manage information on Tier II facilities, on -site hazardous material types and quantities, site configuration, and compliance sta tus. Implement method s to regulate these facilities and to provide incentive s for facilities to share information on an annual basis. Incorporate Risk Management Plans developed by those facilities that are required by U.S. EPA regulations for sites that manufacture, store, or handle hazardous materials into the community's emergency plan to ensure the safety of the public.

Goals Addressed: Goal #1 - Protect and secure life and property. Goal #2 - Continue to improve and enhance county- wide emergency management programs and develop relationships county -wide. Goal #3 - Ensure economic stability, preserve cultural resources, and improve qual ity of life throughout Will County. Goal #4 - Develop, promote, and integrate mitigation actions. Problem/Opportunity: Post-disaster recovery is an arduous process that can have a heavy toll on communities. Disasters can often destroy the community's fu ndamental markets. Disasters can also create a severe loss of income, unemployment, a disruption of life, a reduction in property values, and cause communities to fail. A quick and orderly recovery process is essential to ensure a community's future. A post disaster recovery ordinance regulates repair activity, generally depending on property location. It prepares a community to respond to a disaster in an orderly fashion by requiring citizens to: 1) obtain permits for repairs, 2) refrain from making r epairs, or 3) make repairs using standard methods. A post disaster recovery plan outlines the roles and responsibilities during the recovery efforts, identifies needs for debris management operations, incorporates pre -identified mitigation measures, and in tegrates other mechanisms to adequately manage the local recovery efforts of a disaster. Implementation Strategy: Educate public officials on the need for a \"Post Disaster Recovery\" ordinance by citing past examples of where lack of ordinances restricted recovery efforts and where ordinances expedited the recovery process. Develop and pass a Post Disaster Recovery ordinance. Develop a county- wide Post Disaster Recovery Plan that integrates other county- wide emergency planning doctrine.

Goal #3 - Ensure economic stability, preserve cultural resources, and improve quality of life throughout Will County. Goal #4 - Develop, promote, and integrate mitigation actions. Problem/Opportunity: If left unchecked, various diseases or environmental conditions can r esult in widespread illness and threats to life. Public health emergencies can occur as a result of natural, technological and societal hazards. Systems for surveillance and communication are required to identify public health emergencies and warn the public of potential threats to life. Along with surveillance, public health programs must be in place to prevent or mitigate occurrences. Partnerships with private and public sectors are necessary to coordinate plans, educate the public, and implement emer gency plan strategies. Implementation Strategy: Maintain and enhance emergency plans that address public health hazards and partnerships with public and private sectors to implement emergency plans that safeguard lives and enhance healthy lifestyles.

Monitoring, Evaluation, and Updating the Plan To assure that the All Hazard Mitigation Plan continues to provide an appropriate path for risk reduction throughout the County, it is necessary to r egularly evaluate and update it. The participating jurisdictions throughout the County would like to make mitigation a more predominant component of emergency management activities. The communities of Will County will call on the Hazard Mitigation Steeri ng Committee to convene on a n annual basis to determine the progress of the Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan. The Committee involved in producing this original plan will be invited to be an active participant in the plan update. As the Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan matures, new stakeholders will be identified to join the existing Committee. Will County EMA is responsible for contacting committee members and organizing the annual meeting. The committee will be resp onsible for: Re-assessing hazards and risks to ensure emerging hazards are identified and addressed. Annually reviewing each goal and objective to determine its relevance to the changing situation . Monitor ing and evaluat ing the mitigation strategies in this plan to assure that the document reflects current hazard analyses, development trends, code changes and risk analyses and perceptions. Assuring the appropriate implementation of the 5- year action plan, described below. The committee will hear progress reports from the parties responsible for the various implementation actions to monitor progress. Creating future action plans and mitigation strategies. These should be carefully assessed and prioritized using benefit -cost analysis (BCA) methodology th at FEMA has developed. More information about FEMA's BCA is provided in Appendix G. Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 7: Mitigation Plan Maintenance November, 2013 Chapter 7 - 2 Assuring a continuing role for public comment and involvement as the mitigation plan evolves. Reassessing the plan in light of any major hazard event . The Committee will convene within 45 days of any major event to review all applicable data and to consider the risk assessment, plan goals, objectives, and action items given the effects of the hazard event. Applicable hazard -dependent action items, which are listed below, should be implemented at that time. Review the hazard mitigation plan in connection to other plans , projects, developments and other significant initiatives . Coordinate with internal departments, neighboring municipalities, and local authorities to incorpo rate regional initiatives that transcend the boundaries of the County. Update the plan eve ry five years and submit to IEMA for FEMA approval. The Five -Year Action Plan This section outlines the imp lementation agenda that the Hazard Mitigation Steering Committee should follow for the five years following adoption of this plan. The mitigation action items summarized in Chapter 5 from pages 5- 7 through 5-12 have been identified based on input from the Committee and other participants . More information about each of the items listed can be found in Chapter 6 and identif ies the risks they address and their potential to reduce loss. The benefit to cost was not done for the mitigation strategies listed in this plan. Rather, this analysis using the Department of Homeland Security / Federal Emergency Management Agency (DHS/FEMA) approved Benefit Cost Methods shall be used at the time of a given strategy's development and implementation. The decision to do the benefit to cost to analysis at the time of a strategy 's development is due to the fact of the unknown variables for each listed strategy. The Hazard Mitigation Steering Committee will consider the following an action plan for the 5- year planning cycle. Criteria for Evaluation In addition to implementing t he action plan described above, the Hazard Mitigation Steering Committee will be responsible for evaluating the plan. One of the first tasks of the committee will be to determine the criteria to be used for evaluation of the plan. Included among these cr iteria should be: Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 7: Mitigation Plan Maintenance November, 2013 Chapter 7 - 3 Are the goals and objectives still relevant? Is the risk assessment still appropriate, or has the nature or magnitude of the hazard and/or vulnerability changed over time? Are current resources appropriate for implementing this plan? Have lead agencies participated as originally proposed? Have outcomes been adequate? What problems have occurred in the implementation process? Have member s of the public been adequately involved in the process? Are their comments being heard? Implementatio n through Existing Programs The communities of Will County have recognized the importance of incorporating hazard mitigation practices within existing plans, projects, and programs. The Committee will strive to involve all jurisdictions and departments , as well as local non-participating jurisdictions and neighboring counties to find mitigation opportunities with existing or planned projects and programs . To execute this, Will County EMA will provide strategic outreach to coordinate activities and impleme nt mitigation actions that meet the goals and objectives identified in this plan. Some of the mitigation strategies suggested are more accurately defined as preparedness, response, and recovery actions. Although a hazard mitigation plan is to address miti gation actions, participating jurisdictions recognize the importance of integrating overlapping functions into all phases of emergency management. The preparedness, response, and recovery actions identified support the goals and objectives of this plan. Emergency management agencies throughout the County recognize that DHS/FEMA mitigation funds may not be used to fund these actions. However, these actions are considered important in achieving the overall goal s and objective s of this plan. In recent years , the financial resources for mitigation activities ha ve declined with the reduction in funds for the Pre -Disaster Mitigation Program and the hazard mitigation grant program. The jurisdictions of Will County intend on leveraging DHS initiatives into mitig ation actions in order to ensure efficiency in public funding. The 2006 Emergency Management Performance Grants - Progr am Guidance and Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 7: Mitigation Plan Maintenance November, 2013 Chapter 7 - 4 Application Kit states that \"emergency managers at all levels should leverage all available funding and resources from m ultiple sources wherever possible...(and)...should not restrict their activities to only Federal funding to achieve the goals outlined within their strategies. Rather, special attention should be given to leveraging relevant funding sources and resources that support\"... mitigation activities. 1 Impl ement the National Incident Management S ystem and National Response Plan DHS' Interim National Preparedness Goal (INPG) lends itself the opportunity to be integrated into Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan. The seven national priorities as identified by DHS consist of: Expand regional collaboration Implement the Interim National Infrastructure Protection Plan Strengthen information sharing and collaboration capabilities Strengthen interoperable comm unications Strengthen CBRNE detection, response, and decontamination capabilities Strengthen medical surge and mass prophylaxis capabilities In addition to these priorities, DHS also initiated an additional national priority which was a result of 2005 Hurr icane Katrina. Strengthen emergency operations planning and citizen capabilities. Continued Public Involvement Although the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 requires local governments to only address natural hazards, the County thought it was imperative t o address all hazards, including technological and societal hazards . Despite the security issues, public involvement is critical to the success of any strategic planning process, including hazard mitigation. It is important for hazard mitigation plans to target concerns, comments, and perception of risk as factors in the creation of mitigation strategies. To facilitate the goal of continued public involvement in the planning process, the Committee will assure that the following steps are taken: 1 \"The Su bcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, & Emergency Management Hearing on The National Preparedness System: What are we preparing for? \" April 14, 2005. http://www.house.gov/transportation/pbed/04- 14-05/04- 14- 05memo.html Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Chapter 7: Mitigation Plan Maintenance November, 2013 Chapter 7 - 5 The publi c will be directly involved in the update and review of the plan as members of the All Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee .

The model allows users to characterize flood levels and estimate the expected amounts of damage to buildings and infrastructure as well as the amount of displaced population, shelter requirements, and a variety of other outputs. The FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) indicate that most of Will County 's built environment is outside of the Base Flo od Elevation area. The Base Flood Elevation (BFE) is defined as the area that has a 1% chance of flooding in any given year. Overbank flooding of Will County was modeled using FEMA's GIS -based HAZUS -MH risk assessment application. The flood hazard mod eling was based on areas that are potentially vulnerable to flooding as i ndicated on the digital flood maps provided by Will County . Review Existing Information Existing maps were used to identify the areas of study. Will County has digitized copies of the hardcopy FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMS) . Hydrologic analysis was performed for all reaches identified in the Will County flood GIS data. Analysis The HAZUS -MH Flood model can be used in a variety of ways for the purpose of predicting flooding and assessing the impacts of that flooding. Model options range from having HAZUS perform all necessary hydrologic and hydraulic calculations based solely upon a user provided digital elevation model to integrating selected output from other flood models for the purpose of developing what are typically more accurate flood depth grids. The analysis conducted for Will County used two different approaches that took advantage of the capabilities of the HAZUS model. In both cases, we studied the potential impacts of overbank flooding along the Calumet River which were based upon the Base Flood Elevation (BFE) defined on the flood maps for that area. The BFE is defined as the area that has a 1% chance of flooding in any given year. For the first type of analysis we applied a level 2 methodology which used discharges from the Will County FEMA Flood Insurance Study, Revised March 2003. This study utilized discharges for streams studied in detail. For the second type of HAZUS -MH analysis , a Level I methodology was applied for the remaining flood prone stream segments. A Level I methodology performs the entire hydrologic and hydraulic analysis based upon a user provided digital elevation Will County Emergency Management Agency Count y-Wide All-Hazard Mitigation Plan Appendix B - Hazard Modeling November, 2013 Appendix B - 3 model. For this project we used the elevation model obtained from Will County. This digital elevation model consists of elevation points at approximately 1 meter intervals. Assumptions: HAZUS generates a combination of site specific and aggregated loss estimates depending upon the analysis options that are selec ted and upon the input that is provided by the user. Aggregate inventory loss estimates - which include building stock analysis - are based upon the assumption that building stock is evenly distributed across census blocks. Therefore, it is possible that overestimates of damage will occur in some areas while underestimates will occur in other areas. With this in mind, total losses tend to be more reliable over larger geographic areas than for individual census blocks. Site specific analysis is based u pon loss estimations for individual structures. Analysis of site specific structures takes into account the depth of water in relation to the structure. It also takes into account the actual dollar exposure to the structure for the costs of building reco nstruction, content, and inventory. However, damages are based upon the assumption that each structure falls into a structural class - for example, small versus large hospitals - and that structures in each class will respond in similar fashion to a speci fic depth of flooding. Site specific analysis is also based upon a point location rather than a polygon and therefore the model does not account for the percentage of a building that is inundated. These assumptions suggest that the loss estimates for si te specific structures as well as for aggregate structural losses need to be viewed as approximations of losses that are subject to considerable variability rather than as exact engineering estimates of losses to individual structures. Results The total economic loss is included in Table 1 and depicted by census block in Figures 1 and 2. The majority of the estimated building losses, 88%, were related to flooding of residential structures. As expected, the majority of the flood damage occurs in the we stern half of the county in the urban areas near the City of Joliet. Figures 3, 4, and 5 include five flood prone areas with orthophotos the HAZUS -MH calculated flood boundary (in red), Will County d igitized flood map boundary (in blue), and census block outlines (in black) shown . These census blocks have the highest calculated economic losses. These 9 census blocks had estimated total losses exceeding $6 million each . The two census blocks in Figure 3 are located near Route 59 in the Village of Plainf ield, and are impacted by flooding from the DuPage River.

Tornado Hazards Submitted by: The Polis Center at IUPUI 1200 Waterway Blvd., Suite 100 Indianapolis, Indiana 46202 Phone: 303 East Suite 600 Will County , Illinois 60601 -5276 January 9, 2006 Will County Emergency Management Agency Count y-Wide All-Hazard Mitigation Plan Appendix B - Hazard Modeling November, 2013 Appendix B - 12 GIS a nalysis was utilized to determine the impacts of the 1990 Plainfield , Illinois F4 tornado that skipped thro ugh Will County during mid afternoon. Although the track of this tornado was identified, detail ed information on the area damaged could not be determined. HAZUS -MH data, updated with GIS data provided by Will County, was utilized to identify structures w ithin the damage d area. The pot ential loss from this event was projected based on today's built environment and in today's economy. Review Existing Information GIS analysis was used to determine the potential impacts of an F4 tornado similar to the 1990 tornado, the path of which was determined from a map provided in the 2003 Will County Hazard Analysis. The tornado path is shown in Figure 1. This analysis used tornado widths determined by the Fujita -Pearson Tornado Rating scale. These tornado widths w ere based on guidelines developed by Impact Forecasting, a wholly owned subsidiary of Aon Corporation. It should be noted that these numbers and descriptions are just guidelines and are based on conceptual wind speeds, path widths, and path lengths. Ther e is no guarantee that every tornado will fit exactly into one of these six categories. Table 1 is a recreation of the Fujita- Pearson Number table developed by Impact Forecasting. Figure 1: Historical tornado path Will County Emergency Management Agency Count y-Wide All-Hazard Mitigation Plan Appendix B - Hazard Modeling November, 2013 Appendix B - 13 Table 1: Fujita -Pearson Tornado Ratin g Fujita -Pearson Number Estimated Wind Speed Path Width Path Length Description of Destruction 0 (Gale) 40 -72 mph 6 - 17 yards 0.3 - 0.9 miles Light damage, some damage to chimneys, branches broken, sign boards damaged, shallow -rooted trees blown over. 1 (Moderate) 73 - 112 mph 18 - 55 yards 1.0 - 3.1 miles Moderate damage, roof surfaces peeled off, mobile homes pushed off foundations, attached garages damaged. 2 (Significant) 113 - 157 mph 56 - 175 yards 3.2 - 9.9 miles Considerable damage, entire roofs torn from frame houses, mobile homes demolished, boxcars pushed over, large trees snapped or uprooted. 3 (Severe) 158 - 206 mph 176 - 566 yards 10 - 31 miles Severe damage, walls torn from well - constructed houses, trains overturned, most trees in fores ts uprooted, heavy cars thrown about. 4 (Devastating) 207 - 260 mph 0.3 - 0.9 miles 32 - 99 miles Complete damage, well -constructed houses leveled, structures with weak foundations blown off for some distance, large miss iles generated. 5 (Incredible) 261 - 318 mph 1.0 - 3.1 miles 100 - 315 miles Foundations swept clean, automobiles become missiles and thrown for 100 yards or more, steel-reinforced concrete structures badly damaged. Analysis According to the Impact Forecast methodology, a F4 tornado wil l have a width of 0.3 to 0.9 miles. The Fujita -Pearson scale describes the impact as \" Complete damage, well- constructed houses leveled, structures with weak foundations blown off for some distance, large missiles generated. \" Once the historical path was digitized, two buffers were created. The first was 0.3 miles in width (the yellow buffer) and the second was 0.9 miles in width (the orange buffer).The buffers are depicted in Figure 2. The 2000 Census Block layer that is provided with HAZUS was then added to ArcMap. For each of the two buffers, HAZUS -MH data consisting of the 2000 Census Block layer, the building count layer, and the building dollar exposure were \"clipped\" thus creating two new layers, each one the same geometric size and shape as the b uffer. For each of these new layers, the shape's area field was updated. A field was added to the table to denote the percentage of each Census Block that fell inside the buffer. To populate this field, the area of each clipped Census Block was divided by the area of the original Census Block. The percentages were then multiplied by the original building count, exposure, and population values. Will County Emergency Management Agency Count y-Wide All-Hazard Mitigation Plan Appendix B - Hazard Modeling November, 2013 Appendix B - 14 Assumptions: It was assumed that all buildings and population were evenly distributed across each census b lock. Thus, if 50% of a census block fell within the buffer area, it was assumed that 50% of the structures and populati on also fell within that area. Figure 2: F4 tornado path and buffer Results The results of the analysis are depicted in Table s 2, 3, and 4. The figures for exposure are an estimate of building replacement costs and assume the buildings are completely destroyed. Table 2 shows the estimated building damage by type and dollar loss within 0.3 miles of the tornado path. An estimated 2, 413 buildings would be damaged, totaling over 574 million. Of the buildings damaged, 2,368 are residential structures, totaling almost 486 million. Table 3 shows the estimated building damage by type and dollar loss within 0.9 miles of the tornado path. An estimated 6,718 buildings would be damaged, totaling almost 1.6 billion. Of the buildings damaged, 6,590 are residential structures, totaling over 1.3 billion. Will County Emergency Management Agency Count y-Wide All-Hazard Mitigation Plan Appendix B - Hazard Modeling November, 2013 Appendix B - 15 Table 4 shows the estimated number of people affected. Within 0.3 miles of the tornado pa th, there would be almost 9,000 people. Within 0.9 miles of the tornado path, there would be over 23,000 people. It is important to note that these estimates are based on an area weighted analysis. In this analysis it was assumed that all buildings and population were evenly distributed across each census block. Thus, if 50% of a census block fell within the buffer area, it was assumed that 50% of the structures and population also fell within that area. In reality, the actual number of buildings and p eople could be much higher or lower than estimated.

Submitted by: The Polis Center at IUPUI 1200 Waterway Blvd., Suite 100 Indianapolis, Indiana 46202 Phone: 600 Chicago , Illinois 60601 -5276 January 6, 2006 Will County Emergency Management Agency Count y-Wide All-Hazard Mitigation Plan Appendix B - Hazard Modeling November, 2013 Appendix B - 19 Introduction The CTE team contacted Dr. Robert Bauer of the Illinois State Geological Survey (ISGS) to obtain existing geological information and recommendations for earthquake scenarios. Three earthquake scenarios were developed to provide a reasonable basis for earthquake planning in Will County. These included one deterministic scenario based upon input from the ISGS. A deterministic scenario is bas ed on a specific event without explicit consideration of the probability of its occurrence. The scenario for this study was based on the June 26, 1909 5.1 magnitude Aurora, Illinois ( 41.6N 88.1W ) earthquake. According to the ISGS web site, this earthqua ke has been related to the La Salle anticline in the Illinois Basin. During the earthquake, many chimneys fell, a stove overturned, and gas line connections broke at Aurora. Several chimneys were downed at Forreston, Naperville, Streator, Triumph, and Troy Grove, and one fell at Waukegan. Brick walls cracked at Bloomington, and sidewalks cracked and many chimneys were damaged at Freeport. At Platteville, Wis., about 130 km northwest of Chicago, an old building was cracked; houses were jostled out of plumb at Beloit, Wisconsin about 240 km northwest of Chicago. Additionally, the analysis included two different types of probabilistic scenarios. These types of scenarios are based on ground shaking parameters derived from U.S. Geological Survey probabilist ic seismic hazard curves. The first selecte d probabilistic scenario was a 500 year return period scenario. This scenario evaluates the average impacts of a multitude of possible earthquake epicenters with a magnitude that would be typical of that expec ted for a 500 year return period. The second probabilistic scenario was one that allowed us to calculate an annualized loss. The annualized loss analysis in HAZUS-MH provides a means for averaging potential losses from future scenarios while consideri ng their probabilities of occurrence. The HAZUS -MH earthquake model evaluates 8 different return period scenarios including those for the 100, 250, 500 750, 1000 1500, 2000, and 2500 year return period earthquake events. It then calculates the probabiliti es of these events as well as the interim events, calculates their associated losses, and sums these losses to calculate an annualized loss. These analysis options were chosen because they are useful for prioritization of seismic reduction measures and fo r simulating mitigation strategies. Earthquake hazard modeling scenarios performed consisted of: A 5.3 magnitude earthquake in Aurora, Illinois (deterministic scenario) 500 year return period event (probabilistic scenario) Annualized Earthquake Loss (pr obabilistic scenario) Review Existing Information The ISGS team desires to model a large magnitude earthquake from the New Madrid fault in order to ascertain the potential impact on high rise structures in the Will County area. However, it was determined that such a model could not be run for the following reasons. Will County Emergency Management Agency Count y-Wide All-Hazard Mitigation Plan Appendix B - Hazard Modeling November, 2013 Appendix B - 20 First, HAZUS -MH will not model earthquakes whose epicenter occurs greater than 200 kilometers from the study region. While it is possible to provide ground motion maps to HAZUS which can the n model the impact of such an earthquake event on the exposed inventory, such maps are not available for the Will County region at this time. Second, while this study did include updating of selected inventory components; additional detailed building dat a would be required to model these structures since the default HAZUS building mapping schemes assume all buildings are low -rise (1 -3 stories) structures, distributed according to a default classification of structural materials (wood, concrete, steel, etc .) and designed to code. Because of the lack of detailed building data, HAZUS will likely assume greater damage to high rise structures than will realistically be produced given that it will assume that the maximum height of the structures is 3 stories an d that the entire assumed exposure to the structures will be contained within that part of the structure Given the limitations described above, the ISGS recommended modeling a magnitude 5.0- 5.5 earthquake at the location of a historic magnitude 5.1 epice nter in Aurora, Illinois that occurred in 1909. The coordinates of this earthquake were 41.6N 88.1W longitude as shown in the figure 1 below. Figure1 . Earthquakes in Northern Illinois Analysis To model a deterministic scenario, such as the historical event based in Aurora, Illinois , the user must input a variety of parameters. The parameters include the following: One of the most critical sources of information that is required for accurate assessment of earthquake risk is soils. Unfortunately, N EHRP (National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program) soil classification maps only exist for the southern portion of Illinois . NEHRP soil classifications portray the degree of Will County Emergency Management Agency Count y-Wide All-Hazard Mitigation Plan Appendix B - Hazard Modeling November, 2013 Appendix B - 21 shear -wave amplification that can occur during ground shaking. Because of the lack of soils data, the analysis used a default scenario with D class soils. Dr. Bauer indicated that Will County and the surrounding area do not have a map for liquefaction potential that could be used by HAZUS -MH. However, according to literature, hi storical (moment magnitude 5.1 -5.5) earthquakes should not generate liquefaction and therefore it was determined that no additional effort would be put forth to assess liquefaction potential for this study. Will County has seasonal water table depths of 2 to 3 meters. These probably should not matter since liquefaction should not be expected with earthquake magnitudes below magnitudes of about 6.5. For the analysis we use d a depth to water table of 3 meters. ISGS recommended a n earthquake depth of 5.0 kilometers for the deterministic Aurora earthquake. The historical earthquake depths identified by ISGS ranged from 5 to 10 km. HAZUS -MH also requires the user to define an attenuation (amplitude of the waves) function unless ground motion maps are suppl ied. Because Will County has experienced smaller earthquakes, ISGS made the decision to use the Toro et al. (1997) attenuation function for c alculation of ground motion . Assumptions: The probabilistic analysis and the annualized loss analysis do not require user input of the variables listed above. The assumptions of the annualized loss analysis are as follows: Census tract -based analyses with the assumption that all aggregate inventory is concentrated at the centroid of the census tract for purposes of p erforming loss analysis HAZUS uses USGS probabilistic hazard maps Default soft soil (NEHRP Class D) conditions No ground failure effects 2000 demographic information 2002 square footage data for building occupancies 2002 Means Data for Building Replacement Cost Building -related economic losses only . Losses to lifelines not included Long term or indirect losses not considered HAZUS -MH is a planning tool. The application is not intended as a substitute for detailed engineering analysis. The estimates of social and economic impacts contained in this report were produced using HAZUS loss estimation methodology software which is based on current scientific and engineering knowledge. There are uncertainties inherent in any loss estimation technique. Therefor e, there may be significant differences between the modeled results contained in this report and the actual social and economic losses follow ing a Will County Emergency Management Agency Count y-Wide All-Hazard Mitigation Plan Appendix B - Hazard Modeling November, 2013 Appendix B - 22 specific hazard event. These results can be improved by using enhanced inventory data and hazard information . 5.3 Magnitude with an Epicenter in Aurora, Illinois HAZUS -MH Earthquake Risk Module provides estimates of damage and loss to buildings, essential facilities, transportation and utility lifelines, and population based on scenario or probabilistic earthq uakes. In addition, the Earthquake Risk Module estimates the debris generated, fire, casualties, and shelter requirements following the disaster. Based on consultation with the Illinois State Geologic Survey, the May 26, 1909 5.1 magnitude earthquake tha t occurred in near Aurora, Illinois is the best scenario to model with the limitations on available data. Results: The results of the initial analysis, the 5.3 magnitude Earthquake with an Epicenter in Aurora, Illinois are depicted in Table 1 and 2 and Figure 1. Table 1 identifies the calculated number of damaged buildings by general occupancy classification. HAZUS estimates that about 12,369 buildings will be at least moderately damaged. This is over 8.00 % of the total number of buildings in the reg ion. There are an estimated 405 buildings that will be damaged beyond repair. Table 2 represents building economic losses in millions of dollars. The losses include capital losses as well as income losses. A description of the losses is included in the table. The total building -related losses were 1,137.82 (millions of dollars); 6 % of the estimated losses were related to the business interruption of the region. By far, the largest loss was sustained by the residential occupancies which made up over 81 % of the total loss. Figure 1 represents the building economic losses by census tracts in thousands of dollars . Analysis of this figure indicates that the most substantial damage would occur in the north part of the county. This is consistent with th e area that is currently developed in the county. Essential Facility Losses Aurora Event The HAZUS analysis calculated no essential facility losses for this event. Essential facilities include police stations, fire stations, schools, medical care facilit ies, and emergency operation centers and are analyzed on a site by site basis.

It then calculates the probabilities of these events as well as the interim events, calculates their associated losses, and sums these losses to calculate an annualized loss. Results: The results of the annualized analysis are depicted in Table 5 and 6 and Figure 3. Table 5 indicates identifies the average annual estimated numbe r of buildings at risk to be damaged by general occupancy classification. HAZUS estimates that about 1,202 buildings will be at least moderately damaged. This is over 1.00 % of the total number of buildings in the region. There are an estimated 1 buildin gs that will be damaged beyond repair. Table 6 identifies the average annual estimated economic risk in millions of dollars. The risk include s capital losses as well as income losses. A description of the Will County Emergency Management Agency Count y-Wide All-Hazard Mitigation Plan Appendix B - Hazard Modeling November, 2013 Appendix B - 28 losses is included in the table. The total bu ilding -related losses were 0.25 (millions of dollars); 27 % of the estimated losses were related to the business interruption of the region. By far, the largest loss was sustained by the residential occupancies which made up over 55 % of the total loss. Figure 3 represents the average annual estimated building economic risk by census tr acts in thousands of dollars. As expected the losses reflect the same distribution as the 500 year probabilistic analysis. Essential Facility Losses Annualized The HAZUS analysis calculated no essential facility losses for this event. Table 5.

ALOHA is a computer program designed especially for use by people responding to chemical accidents, as well as for emergency planning an d training. Chlorine is a common chemical used in industrial operations that can be found in either liquid or gas form. Rail, truck tankers, and barges commonly haul chlorine, as well as other hazardous materials, to and from facilities. For this scenar io, moderate atmospheric and climatic conditions with a slight breeze from the west were assumed. The target area of Arsenal R d and I -55 was chosen due to its large industrial facilities, rail and truck hubs, and the presence of a large number of large qu antity hazardous material generators. Review Existing Information The 2000 Census Block boundaries and population figures, as well as the values for building counts and building replacement cost were extracted from the HAZUS -MH provided inventory. The ge ographic area covered in this analysis is depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1: Location of Chlorine Release Will County Emergency Management Agency Count y-Wide All-Hazard Mitigation Plan Appendix B - Hazard Modeling November, 2013 Appendix B - 33 Analysis In terms of the atmospheric conditions, ALOHA was setup with a wind speed of 5 mph at a westerly direction. The temperature was set for 68 \u00b0 F with a medium level of humidity and partly cloudy skies. In terms of the source conditions, a horizontal, cylindrical -shaped tank was selected. The diameter of the tank was set to 9 feet. The length of the tank was set to 66 feet. These settings cr eated a tank with a volume of 31,409 gallons. At the time of this release, the tank was estimated to be 80% full. The chlorine in this tank is in its liquid state. This release was based on a leak from a hole, a little less than \u00bd\" in diameter and 12 inches above the bottom of the tank. Using the settings above, approximately 20,450 pounds of material would be released. The image in Figure 2 depicts the plume footprint generated by ALOHA. As the substance moves away from the source, the level of conce ntration of that substance decreases. Each color -coded area depicts a level of concentration. These concentrations are measured in parts per million, or ppm. Figure 2: Plume Footprint Generated by ALOHA Will County Emergency Management Agency Count y-Wide All-Hazard Mitigation Plan Appendix B - Hazard Modeling November, 2013 Appendix B - 34 The area in red, at 20 ppm, would extend no m ore than 1,647 yards out from the point of release. The area in orange, at 3 ppm, would extend no more than 2.6 miles out from the point of release. The area in yellow, at 1 ppm, would extend no more than 4.6 miles out from the point of release. The gray area depicts what ALOHA refers to as \"uncertainty lines\", which means that within the confines of the entire plume footprint, the ALOHA model is 95% confident that the release will stay within this boundary. The 2000 Census Block layer was added to ArcM ap and overlaid with the plume footprint. The 2000 Census Block layer was then clipped against each of the four footprint areas. Clipping could be defined as the process of extracting features from one layer, in this case the 2000 Census Block layer, bas ed on the boundary of another layer, in this case one of the four footprint areas. Figures 3 and 4 depict the 2000 Census Block areas before and after the \"clipping\" process. Figure 3: The 2000 Census Block Areas before the \"Clipping\" Process Will County Emergency Management Agency Count y-Wide All-Hazard Mitigation Plan Appendix B - Hazard Modeling November, 2013 Appendix B - 35 Figure 4: The 2000 Census Block Areas after the \"Clipping\" Process A field was added to the table to denote the percentage of each Census Block that fell inside each of the four footprint areas . To populate this field, the area of each clipped Census Block was divided by the area of the original Census Block. The percentages were then multiplied by the building count and exposure values. Assumptions: For this analysis it was assumed that all buildings and population were evenly distributed across each cens us block. Thus, if 50% of a census block fell within the buffer area, it was assumed that 50% of the structures and populati on also fell within that area. Will County Emergency Management Agency Count y-Wide All-Hazard Mitigation Plan Appendix B - Hazard Modeling November, 2013 Appendix B - 36 Results By summarizing the results of each of the four footprint areas, the GIS analysis estimates that as many as 1,783 buildings could be exposed. The inventory data upon which these estimates are based was obtained from the HAZUS -MH provided dataset . This dataset was compiled through a combination of 2000 Census data and info rmation compiled by Du n and Bra dstreet for the HAZUS -MH application. Based on population figures from the 2000 Census, approximately 5,427 people would be affected. As noted earlier, it is important to note that these estimates are based on an area weighted analysis. In this analysis it was assumed t hat all buildings were evenly distributed across each census block. Thus, if 50% of a census block fell within the buffer area, it was assumed that 50% of the structures and population also fell within that area. In reality, the actual number of buildings could be much higher or lower than estimated. The results of the analysis are depicted in Table s 1 through 6. Table 1 summarizes the results of the four footprint areas in terms of buildings counts and replacement costs. Tabl e 2 summarizes the results of the four footprint areas in terms of population.

EPA's ALOHA (Arial Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres) model was utilized to assess the area of impact for a chlorine release from a barge traveling on the Des Plaines River near US Route 6 and I-55. ALOHA is a computer program designed especially for use by people responding to chemical accidents, as well as for emergency planning and training. Chlorine is a common chemical used in industrial operations that can be found in either liquid or gas form. Rail, truck tankers, and barges commonly haul chl orine, as well as other hazardous materials, to and from facilities. For this scenario, moderate atmospheric and climatic conditions with a slight breeze from the west were assumed. The target area of the US Route 6, I -55, and the Des Plaines River was c hosen due to its heavy barge traffic, large rail and truck hubs, as well as the presence of a large number of large quantity hazardous material generators. Review Existing Information The 2000 Census Block boundaries and population figures, as well as the values for building counts and building replacement cost were extracted from the HAZUS -MH provided inventory. The geographic area covered in this analysis is depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1: Location of Chlorine Release Will County Emergency Management Agency Count y-Wide All-Hazard Mitigation Plan Appendix B - Hazard Modeling November, 2013 Appendix B - 42 Analysis In terms of the atmos pheric conditions, ALOHA was setup with a wind speed of 5 mph at a westerly direction. The temperature was set for 68\u00b0 F with a medium level of humidity and partly cloudy skies. This scenario was setup as a direct release at a rate of 50 tons per hour fo r a period (i.e., duration) of 60 minute s. The source height for this release was set to 0. Using these settings, approximately 100,000 pounds of material would be released at a rate of 1,670 pounds per minute. The image in Figure 2 depicts the plume fo otprint generated by ALOHA. As the substance moves away from the source, the level of concentration of that substance decreases. Each color -coded area depicts a level of concentration. These concentrations are measured in parts per million, or ppm. Figure 2: Plume Footprint Generated by ALOHA Will County Emergency Management Agency Count y-Wide All-Hazard Mitigation Plan Appendix B - Hazard Modeling November, 2013 Appendix B - 43 The area in red, at 20 ppm, would extend no more than 2.2 miles out from the point of release. The area in orange, at 3 ppm, would extend no more than 6 miles out from the point of release. The area in yello w, at 1 ppm, would extend more than 6 miles out from the point of release. The gray area depicts what ALOHA refers to as \"uncertainty lines\", which means that within the confines of the entire plume footprint, the ALOHA model is 95% confident that the rel ease will stay within this boundary. The 2000 Census Block layer was added to ArcMap and overlaid with the plume footprint. The 2000 Census Block layer was then clipped against each of the four footprint areas. Clipping could be defined as the process o f extracting features from one layer, in this case the 2000 Census Block layer, based on the boundary of another lay er, in this case one of the four footprint areas. Figures 3 and 4 depict the 2000 Census Block areas before and after the \"clipping\" proces s.

To populate this field, the area of each clipped Census Block was divided by the area of the original Census Block. The percentages were then multiplied by the building count and exposure values. Assumptions: For this analysis it was assumed that all buildings and population were evenly distributed across each census block. Thus, if 50% of a census block fell within the buffer area, it was assumed that 50% of the structures and populati on also fell within that area. Results By summa rizing the results of each of the four footprint areas, the GIS analysis estimates that as many as 8,205 buildings could be exposed. The inventory data upon which these estimates are based was obtained from the HAZUS -MH provided dataset . This dataset was compiled through a combination of 2000 Census data and info rmation Will County Emergency Management Agency Count y-Wide All-Hazard Mitigation Plan Appendix B - Hazard Modeling November, 2013 Appendix B - 45 compiled by Dun and Bra dstreet for the HAZUS -MH application. Based on population figures from the 2000 Census, approximately 27,722 people would be affected.

In the Oklahoma City Bombing, a Ryder rental truck was loaded with approximately 5,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate fertilizer and detonated outside of the Murrah Federal Building. The explosion ge nerated a pressure blast of 500,000 psi, destroyed one -third of the Murrah Federal Building, and created a crater thirty feet wide and e ight feet deep. The target analyzed in this hazard modeling is the Will County Court House . This identified target is consistent with Will County's Infrastructure Security Buffer Zone P rotection Plan, which utilizes the Carver Scoring system to identify high- profile targets. Review Existing Information The 2000 Census Block boundaries and population figures, as well as the values for building counts and building replacement cost were ex tracted from the HAZUS -MH provided inventory . The geographic area covered in this analysis is depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1: Location of the Will County Court House Building Will County Emergency Management Agency Count y-Wide All-Hazard Mitigation Plan Appendix B - Hazard Modeling November, 2013 Appendix B - 54 Analysis Buffers were created at 100 feet, 200 feet, 350 feet, 650 feet, an d 1,150 feet, using the Will County Court House as the point -of-origin. These distances were selected based on the diagram in Figure 2. The distances listed above are where 5,000 pounds of explosives intersect the incident overpressure curves. Figure 2: Damage Impact as a Function of Distance and Weight Each incident overpressure curve represents the amount of blast pressure emitted from an explosive device. The area between each curve represents the amount of damage that can b e expected. As the incident overpressure increases (stated in pounds per square inch or PSI), so too does the amount of damage. For each level of potential damage, a percentage was applied when calculating the number of buildings damaged and replacement cost. Those percentages are depicted in Table 1. Table 1: Percent Damage Factor per Amount of Damage Damage Type Percent Damaged Description Severe Damage 100% Total destruction of most buildings Heavy Damage 75% Over 50% of major structural and se condary Unrepairable Damage 50% Sections of structure may collapse or lose structural capacity Repairable Damage 25% Minor to major structural and non -structural deformation Minimal Damage 5% No permanent deformation, minor damage Will County Emergency Management Agency Count y-Wide All-Hazard Mitigation Plan Appendix B - Hazard Modeling November, 2013 Appendix B - 55 As stated above, buff ers were created at 100 feet, 200 feet, 350 feet, 650 feet, and 1,150 feet, using the Will County Court House as the point -of-origin.

September, 2012, FEMA released the Benefit Cost Analysis Tool version 4.8 which is available to be used to demonstrate cost -effectiveness for FEMA's HMA grant programs. A link is provided below to download the software. Due to the size of the toolkit, the installation files are separated into three separate .ZIP files. Tool available from: http://www.fema.gov/benefit- cost-analysis#0 Training in the Benefit Cost Analysis process is available online from: http://training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/IS/courseOverview.aspx?code=IS -276 Onsite training in the Benefit Cost Analysis process is available from the Eme rgency Management Institute with more -Cost%20Analysis%20Entry- Level%20Training%20Apr22- AND PRACTICES for Retrofitting Flood-Prone Residential Structures ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES APPENDIX B Understanding the FEMA Benefit-Cost Analysis Process The Stafford Act authorizes the President to establish a program to provide technical and financial assistance to state and local governments to assist in the implementation of hazard mitigation measures that are cost effective and designed to substantially reduce injuries, loss of life, hardship, or the risk of future damage and destruction of property. To evaluate proposed hazard mitigation projects prior to funding FEMA requires a Benefit-Cost Analysis (BCA) to validate cost effectiveness. BCA is the method by which the future benefits of a mitigation project are estimated and compared to its cost. The end result is a benefit-cost ratio (BCR), which is derived from a project's total net benefits divided by its total project cost. The BCR is a numerical expression of the cost effectiveness of a project. A project is considered to be cost effective when the BCR is 1.0 or greater, indicating the benefits of a prospective hazard mitigation project are sufficient to justify the costs. Although the preparation of a BCA is a technical process, FEMA has developed software, written materials, and training to support the effort and assist with estimating the expected future benefits over the useful life of a retrofit project. It is imperative to conduct a BCA early in the project development process to ensure the likelihood of meeting the cost-effective eligibility requirement in the Stafford Act. B.1 Risk Risk is defined in terms of expected probability and frequency of the hazard occurring, the people and property exposed, and the potential consequences. To estimate future damages (and the benefits of avoiding them), the probabilities of future events must be considered. The probabilities of future events profoundly affect whether a proposed retrofit project is cost effective. For example, the benefits of avoiding flood damage for a building in the 10-percent-annual-chance of flooding floodplain will be enormously greater than the benefits of avoiding flood damage for an identical building situated at the 0.001-percent-annual-chance of flooding level. In addition to the probability of the future flood events, it is just as important to consider the consequences associated with said event on a building. Estimated flood damages for a one-story building will typically be greater than that of a multi-story building or a building with a closed versus open foundation. The damages sustained by existing buildings exposed to flood hazards include site damage, structural and Contents APPENDIX B.

B-5B-2 ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES for Retrofitting Flood-Prone Residential StructuresAPPENDIX B UNDERSTANDING THE FEMA BENEFIT-COST ANALYSIS PROCESS nonstructural building damage, destruction or impairment of service equipment, and loss of contents. These types of damage, along with loss of function are avoided if buildings are located away from flood hazard areas and/or built to exceed the minimum requirements. Many people may not be aware of the hazards that could affect their property and may not understand the risk they assume through decisions they make regarding their property. Property owners must understand how the choices they make could potentially reduce the risk of it being damaged by natural hazards. Property owners often misunderstand their risk; therefore, risk communication is critical to help them understand the risk that they assume. One common misperception is the 1-percent-annual-chance flood, or 100-year flood. There is a 1-percent chance each year of a flood that equals or exceeds the 100-year flood event elevation. Many property owners believe that being in the 1-percent-annual-chance floodplain means that there is only a 1-percent chance of ever being flooded, which they deem a very small risk. Or, they may believe that the 100-year flood can only happen once every 100 years. Unfortunately, these misperceptions result in a gross underestimation of their flood risk. In reality, over the course of a 30-year mortgage, a residential building within the Special Flood Hazard Area has a 26-percent chance of being damaged by a flood, compared to a 10-percent chance of fire or 17-percent chance of burglary. The discussion of risk with the homeowner can be difficult. It is important to find methods to convey the natural hazard risks for a site and how those risks may be addressed by retrofitting the building. The best available information should be examined, including FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), records of historical flooding, and advice from local experts and others who can evaluate flood risks. B.2 Benefits The benefits considered in a retrofitting measure are the future damages or losses that are expected to be avoided as a result of the proposed mitigation project. Benefits cannot be determined exactly because the precise number and severity of future flood events is unknown. As a result, benefits are estimated based on experienced or hypothetical flood events of various magnitudes. Benefits for flood retrofit projects typically fall into the following categories: Building: reflect damages to the structure and are typically estimated using a depth damage function (DDF) and the building replacement value or historical damage records (e.g., flood insurance claim data); Figure B-1 illustrates that as floodwaters rise, more damage is done to the structure. Content: reflect damages to the contents within a building and are typically estimated using a DDF and the contents value or historical damage records (e.g., flood insurance claim data). Displacement: reflect the extra costs incurred when occupants of a residence are displaced to temporary housing due to a flood event. Displacement costs may be incurred for residential, commercial, or public buildings. Displacement occurs only when damages to a structure are sufficiently severe that the structure cannot be repaired with occupants in place. NOTE A depth damage function (DDF) is an estimation of direct damage to the building based on a depth of flooding calculated as the percent damage to structures. DDFs are compiled from a variety of sources, including FEMA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). DDFs typically vary based on the building type (i.e., one-story versus two-story), foundation (i.e., open versus closed), and occupancy type (i.e., residential versus commercial). B-3 ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES for Retrofitting Flood-Prone Residential StructuresUNDERSTANDING THE FEMA BENEFIT-COST ANALYSIS PROCESS APPEN DIX B Figure B-1. The graph on the left illustrates how increases in flood depths increase the value of the DDF. The DDF is a relationship between the flood depth and the finished floor elevation of the building and not the elevation of the adjacent ground. Loss of Business or Rental Income: reflect the impact that may occur when damages are severe enough to result in a temporary closure of a business operating within a facility and estimated based on the net income lost during that closure. Value of Service: reflect the loss of function of a facility and quantify the service typically provided from the structure. Typical services include public services like law enforcement, fire rescue, medical, general government administrative operations, and public library, as well as utilities like electricity and water treatment. Other: reflect damages that are not usually estimated in the previous categories. Some typical benefits may include debris removal costs and emergency management costs. B.3 Estimating Benefits The calculation of benefits for a proposed mitigation project entails estimating the present value of the sum of the expected annual damages over the useful life. The process takes into consideration: probabilities of various levels of flooding events and associated damages; useful lifetime of the mitigation project; and time value of money.B-4 ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES for Retrofitting Flood-Prone Residential StructuresAPPENDIX B UNDERSTANDING THE FEMA BENEFIT-COST ANALYSIS PROCESS Some helpful terms to consider when estimating benefits are: Expected annual damages are the damages per year expected over the life of the structure or useful life of the mitigation project. \"Expected annual\" does not mean that these damages will occur every year. Scenario damages indicate the estimated damages that would result from a single flood of a particular depth at the building under evaluation. For example, the scenario damages for a 3-foot flood are the expected damages and losses each time a 3-foot flood occurs at a particular site. Scenario damages do not depend on the probability of floods at that location. Historical damages are based on actual recorded damages (versus being estimated) and typically associated with a flood frequency to help estimate the probability of occurrence. The scenario (or historical) damages and the expected annual damages before mitigation provide, in combination, a complete picture of the vulnerability of the building to flood damage before undertaking a mitigation project. Expected annual damages will generally be much smaller than scenario or historical damages because they are multiplied by the probabilities of occurrence. A building with high expected annual damages means that not only are scenario damages high, but also that flood probabilities are relatively high. If expected annual damages are high, then there will be high potential benefits in avoiding such damages. Damages after mitigation depend on the effectiveness of the mitigation measure in avoiding damages. The expected annual damages and losses after mitigation also depend very strongly on the degree of flood risk at the site under evaluation. For some mitigation projects, such as acquisition, the scenario damages and expected annual losses after mitigation will be zero. For other mitigation projects, such as elevation or flood barriers, scenario damages, and expected annual losses after mitigation will be lower than before mitigation, but there is always some chance of flooding so the after mitigation damages cannot be zero. The expected annual benefit for a project is given by Equation B-1. EQUATION B-1: EXPECTED ANNUAL BENEFIT EAB = EADBefore Mitigation - EADAfter Mitigation where: EAB = Expected annual benefit EADBefore Mitigation = Expected annual damages before mitigation EADAfter Mitigation = Expected annual damages after mitigation In order to compare the future benefits to the current cost of the proposed mitigation project, a discount rate is applied over the life of the project to calculate the net present value of the expected annual benefits. For FEMA-funded mitigation projects, the discount rate is set by the Office of Management and Budget. Equation B-2 shows how to calculate the project benefits using the annual discount rate.B-5 ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES for Retrofitting Flood-Prone Residential StructuresUNDERSTANDING THE FEMA BENEFIT-COST ANALYSIS PROCESS APPE NDIX B EQUATION B-2: PROJECT BENEFITS where: B = project benefits EAB = total expected annual net benefit r = annual discount rate used to determine net present value of benefits T = estimated time the project will be effective, Project Useful Life To evaluate cost effectiveness, a project's total net benefits are divided by its total project cost, resulting in a project BCR, as shown in Equation B-3. A project is considered to be cost effective when the BCR is greater than or equal to 1.0, indicating the benefits are sufficient to justify the costs. EQUATION B-3: BENEFIT-COST RATIO where: BCR = benefit-cost ratio Project Benefits = total project net benefits Project Costs = total project cost B.4 FEMA BCA Software FEMA's BCA program is a key mechanism used by FEMA and other agencies to evaluate certain hazard mitigation projects to determine eligibility and assist in Federal funding decisions.

Review with each jurisdiction of their plans and ordinances Provision to each jurisdiction of website link to the draft plan update for final review by jurisdict ion and public comment. Target Expertise Input and Correspondence Summaries HAZUS Installation and Integration For the original plan, t he Mitigation Project Team held a working meeting with Will County EMA and Will County GIS Division. The Polis Center i nstalled and implemented the HAZUS -MH software on Will County equipment. To validate the installation and demonstrate the HAZUS -MH capabilities, the Mitigation Project Team performed an Earthquake risk assessment using the HAZUS -MH default data. Following the validation, the Mitigation Project Team demonstrated the software, data, and HAZUS -MH risk assessment reports to the staff. Correspondence with FEMA on Past Disaster Declaration Information For the original plan, t he Mitigation Project Team contacte d FEMA Mitigation Officer to provide input and data on past declarations in Will County. The Mitigation Project Team was soliciting information on the type of disaster, eligible federal costs reimbursed, types of Public Assistance project categories, and other pertinent information for this project. FEMA could not readily access this information and requested the Mitigation Project Team to contact IEMA. Correspondence with IEMA on Past Disaster Declarations for Will County For the original plan, t he Mitig ation Project Team contacted IEMA Mitigation Officer to provide input and da ta on past declarations in the C ounty. IEMA provided data on all state declarations by County, the type of federal assistance received, and the federal costs. IEMA also provided weather data of past events. Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Appendix E - Public Involvement November, 2013 Appendix E - 11 For the update of the plan, information on past declarations was obtained from the IEMA Hazard Mitigation Plan and FEMA's website: http://www.fema.gov/disasters . Correspondence wi th US Army Corps of Engineers For the original plan, t he Mitigation Project Team contacted the US Army Corps of Engineers to obtain information on hazardous material that is transported through the County via U.S Waterways, Harbors, and the Great Lakes. The US Army Corps of Engineers provided detailed historical information, type of materials, and insight on the County 's busiest waterways. For the update of the plan, much of this information is now available online through various websites of the US Army Corps of Engineers and National Transportation Safety Board. GIS Integration Working Meeting and Correspondence For the original plan, t he intent of this meeting was to provide a brief tutorial on HAZUS -MH to Will County GIS Division staff and to identify County GIS data that will be incorporated into the HAZUS -MH model and GIS Analysis. The Polis Center provided the strategy of updating and integrating County GIS data and the data documentation that will be required. A review was conducted of each attrib ute (field) in the databases and identified the attributes that will be updated. The attributes are of four major types listed below. Mandatory for HAZUS to run correctly (i.e. building classes) Required for reports (i.e. number of beds) Not required (i. e. American hospital Association (AHA) ID) Data and information will come from another source (soil type from Illinois Geological Survey) Will County Stormwater Management Committee Coordination For the original plan, a coordination meeting was held with representatives of the Will County Stormwater Management Committee. This meeting was lead by a Mitigation Steering Committee member who is also a member of the Will County Stormwater Management Committee. A brief overview of FEMA's Mitigation Program an d the requirements of the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 were provided. An overview of the All -Hazard Mitigation Plan was discussed, outlining the goals, strategies, and progress of the Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan. The Mitigation Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Appendix E - Public Involvement November, 2013 Appendix E - 12 Project Team solicited guidance from the Will County Stormwater Management Committee on what their greatest risks were and requested their input. For the plan update, Mr. Derek O'Sullivan, Assistant Director of the Will County Land Use Department and membe r of the Stormwater Management Planning Committee, provided technical assistance in the review and update of the Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan. Email and Telephone Correspondence with Dr. Bauer (Illinois State Geologic Survey) For the original plan, t he Mitigation Project Team began correspondence with Dr. Bauer with the Illinois State Geologic Survey to identify and quantify the risk of an earthquake to the communities of Will County. Dr. Bauer provided a plethora of input on the impa cts of an earthquake originating from the New Madrid fault system, the Des Plaines impact structure, or the assorted fault traces in Northern Illinois. Dr. Bauer also provided input on the hazard modeling scenario most likely to occur and what would truly represent an event that would significantly impact the County. Great Lakes Partnership (GLP) Coordination and General Meeting Attendance For the original plan, t he Mitigation Team held periodic meetings with representatives of the Great Lakes Partnership and attended their annual conference in October of 2005. GLP's mission is to bring business and government leaders together for cross -sector collaboration to address critical infrastructure interdependencies and related homeland and economic security chal lenges. Their goal is to proactively promote business continuity planning through the use of best practices, information sharing, and innovation. The Mitigation Team attended the Great Lakes Partnership's General Meeting on October 20, 2005. The GLP Gene ral Meeting had the theme \"Sustainable Preparedness\" and was a day -long session attended by subject matter experts and representatives of the private and public sector. The Mitigation Project Team solicited input, recommendations, and ideas from private a nd public sector professionals, as well as subject matter experts. Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) Solicitation Will County EMA solicited input from the Will County LEPC and extended invitations to attend the Committee Meetings. The Will County LEPC is an organization of industrial, governmental and citizen Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Appendix E - Public Involvement November, 2013 Appendix E - 13 groups whose purpose is to provide a forum in which the local community and facilities can discuss issues related to hazardous substances. Launch of a New Public Will County EMA Website To ma intain public interest and to update them on the latest development in emergency management, Will County EMA updated their web -site in time for the 2006 Severe Weather Preparedness Season. Will County EMA provided a link to the latest development of the h azard mitigation project. Since then, Will County EMA has maintained their website and added the social media Facebook tool to provide the public and response partners with information on the hazards, preparedness, weather alerts, special needs registry, and other valuable information to inform the public. Utilization of websites and social media has become an everyday tool for educating public about the hazards that face Will County and for the public to provide input on emergency management issues. Wil l County EMA has also participated in the Chicago Regional Catastrophic Planning Team's public information campaign called Gear Up/Get Ready which has provided the region with a wealth of emergency preparedness education materials and public activities.

It is important for hazard mitigation plans to target public concerns, comments, and perception of risk as factors in the creation of mitigation strategies. To ensure consensus with the public, the Mitigation Team developed several mechanisms to secure sensitive information and to still reach out to the public to participate in the Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan. Public input was incorporated into the plan through various efforts. Will County EMA held a public meeting to allo w the public to participate in the 2008 Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan . This public meeting enabled the community to learn about their hazards and the mitigation planning process. Will County Emergency Management Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Appendix E - Public Involvement November, 2013 Appendix E - 16 Public Survey For the plan update, t he Mitigation T eam developed a public survey to gauge the concerns of the public, as well as provide feedback to help guide the Committee in identifying potential mitigation actions. The questionnaire target ed the public's thought on what their and their community's gre atest risk is, what they have done to mitigate their home, and what they would do when a disaster strikes. This questionnaire was made available on the Will County EMA website ( http://www.willcountyema.org ) and Facebook page along with jurisdictional websites . This allowed the public to communicate their concerns, comments, and ideas on what their community and/or Will County can do to mitigate from all hazards.

The Will County Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee reviewed, analyzed and commented on every section of the 2008 Plan. Edits and comments were ma de to the introductory and profile sections. The Committee used Census 2010 data, where available, or the most current information in updating the demographics and land use in Will County for the profile section. Upon review of the introductory and overv iew sections of the risk assessment, the Committee decided to keep the same hazards in the 2008 Plan as no new hazards had affected the area that were not considered in 2008. Occurrence and probability data was updated as part of the plan's risk assessment . For the vulnerability assessment, critical facilities, building counts and losses were updated to reflect changes over the past five years. The overall goals and objectives of the 2008 plan were reviewed and it was determined that a number of the same objectives and goals would remain in the Plan Update. Plan maintenance procedures were also reviewed and updated to reflect current changes in staff and annual/bi annual meetings. A review of the mitigation actions by the Planning Committee was conducted on the actions identified in the 2008 Plan and any amendments thereto and provided an analysis as to whether each action is ongoing, has been completed or should be deleted from the Plan Update. A status of each has been provided in the update. The following factors were taken into consideration when reviewing the 2008 Plan: Whether the goals address current and expected conditions; If the nature/magnitude of risk s have changed; If there are current resources appropriate for implementing the Plan; Whether implementation problems, such as technical, political, legal or coordination issues hinder development; If outcomes have occurred as expected; and How communities , agencies and partners participated in the implementation process.

The res ult of the workshops and update of these Goals, Objectives, and Mitigation Actions is summa rized in the following table. Mitigation Success Stories Will County endeavors to improve planning and implement effective mitigation actions for the safety of the public it serves and for the development of an inviting and successful place to live, work, and play. Will County Emergency Managem ent Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Appendix F - Updates to 2008 Will County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan November, 2013 Appendix F - 3 County and local jurisdictions have come together to develop and implement the mitigation actions identified in the 2008 Will County County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan . Progress is being made daily with jurisdictions coming together to iden tify and address the identified issues. Highlights include: Flood Mitigation County -Wide Stormwater Management Ordinance and plan were updated in 2010 and supplemented with the Technical Guidance Manual for County -Wide Stormwater Ordinance . The ordinanc e was adopted by all communities within Will County, with twenty- nine communities meeting requirements to be delegated responsibilities for ordinance enforcement. Property Buyouts of approximately $10.6 million have resulted with funding from the 1996 and 2008 flood mitigation grants. This allows the County and communities to implement open space planning for areas in commercial and private developments with repetitive flooding. With a common ordinance and planning guidance, sixty- one stormwater projects have been identified and are being addressed by the WCSMPC. Flood Monitoring has improved as a result of the installation of additional stream gauges. Jurisdictions works with the National Weather Service to utilize the data to anticipate flooding issues and safeguard the public. See tools developed with NWS and Efforts The RCPGP has been an important initiative being several collaborative projects to the County which include the development of plans for a regional hub that includes mass care and evacuation elements, citizen prep aredness through the GearUp!GetReady! Program, regional assessment of capabilities and an all hazard risk assessment plan, logistics and resour ce management planning, and animal sheltering projects. Will County Emergency Managem ent Agency County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan Appendix F - Updates to 2008 Will County -Wide All Hazard Mitigation Plan November, 2013 Appendix F - 4 Participants from the IL -IN-WI CSA came together to participate in Whole Community conferences that provided training and opportunities to discuss issues. WC EMA and local jurisdictions have been very active in the RCPGP program. Training and Public Awareness NIMS training has been an important tool in promoting professional development in emergency management throughout the County. Since 2009, thirteen people have obtained or renewed their IPEM and e ight people have received their CEM designation. Public education has increased with the use of websites, Facebook pages,newsletters, and video/radio PSAs. WC EMA has implemented and supported a speaker's bureau and county- wide PIO group as outreach for public education. The WC EMA Public Preparedness Group and local jurisdictions are active in community events for public education and utilize the RCPCP's GearUp!Get Ready! Program. GIS Use GIS is an important tool that is being integrated county- wide f or planning, response, and recovery activities. Upon receipt of the updated DFIRMS, additional floodplain management projects will be implemented using this technology. Storm Ready and Weather Radios The County has adopted the StormReady program and has e ncouraged local jurisdictions to also participate. StormReady is a nationwide community preparedness program to help community develop plans to handle all types of severe weather through the implementation of guidelines that improve their hazardous weathe r operations.
