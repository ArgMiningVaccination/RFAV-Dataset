It can give you energy or send you crashing. It can lift your mood or fill you with guilt. It can enhance digestion or rush you to the bathroom. Something this powerful should not be taken lightly, yet little attention is paid to what foods are best for your health and why. Many whole foods help reduce inflammation, fight against oxidative stress, decrease risk of cancer, enhance immunity or even help detoxify the body. Amazingly, one particular family of vegetables does all of these. It's time to welcome the Brassica family into your home! The Brassica vegetables are better known as the cruciferous vegetables. They include: Arugula, Land cress, Shepard's purse and Watercress Kale, Mustard Bok choy and Kohlrabi Broccoli and Cauliflower Brussels and Daikon radish Rutabaga and Turnip Horseradish, Brown mustard seed and Yellow mustard seed Each member of this family is high in vitamins and minerals such as vitamins A, C, E, K, folic acid, several B vitamins, iron, magnesium, potassium, zinc and more. They are also high in protein, fiber and omega 3 fats. These nutrients alone help reduce inflammation, fight oxidative damage and enhance immunity. Additionally, the Brassica family is very high in phytonutrients, specifically isothiocyanates and one of its precursors called glucosinolates. These two groups of phytonutrients have been found to be powerful health promoters. Glucosinolates and Isothiocyanates: Deactivate potential cancer-causing substances before they can damage DNA. Alter communication between cells to prevent them from becoming cancerous. Neutralize carcinogens and stimulate their removal from the body. Inhibit cancer cells from multiplying and induce apoptosis (cell death). Regulate the inflammatory system by decreasing the inflammatory response. May prevent damage to blood vessels in people with chronic blood sugar problems. May prevent bacterial overgrowth of Helicobacter pylori. Increase detoxification of toxins that may increase cancer risk. Increase Phase II detoxification while regulating Phase I detoxification. As you can see, the Brassica family tree is truly the Tree of Life! By adding cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli into your daily meals you can optimize health and detoxify the body. Here are some other great detoxifying foods to add to your week: Beets increase phase II detoxification Pomegranate regulates phase I detoxification Artichoke has liver protective effects Flax seeds and psyllium husk powder help bind toxins for elimination Green tea increases both phase I and II detoxification Essential fatty acids from cold water fish and flax seed oil assists with detoxification Fresh fruits and vegetables replenish glutathione, a necessary compound for phase II detoxification Turmeric also increases glutathione levels High quality protein such as free range eggs and meat provide amino acids necessary for all detoxification pathways Hopefully, this three-part series has helped you understand where toxins hide in your life and how to reduce your exposure. If you decide to perform a more intense liver detox, please contact a local holistic nutritionist, naturopath or holistic physician to ensure you know the safest way to remove toxins. But, through small, consistent changes to your environment and diet you can still begin to remove toxins from your life and lead a path to better health! Happy Spring Cleaning!
