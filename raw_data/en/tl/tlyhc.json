How Long Does It Take For Seizure Medicines To Reach The Bloodstream? - A dose of medication will reach a peak, or maximum, level in the blood 30 minutes to 4 or 6 hours after it is taken. The peak time varies for different drugs. - The time between taking the medication and reaching the peak level depends on the specific medicine and what form it is in, for example a liquid, tablets, capsule or slow-release form. - In general, liquids are absorbed quickly. - Medications in slow-release forms are absorbed gradually over hours and produce the steadiest levels in the blood. These slow-release forms can be taken less often, once or twice a day. - Eating before a dose may also affect how long it takes to reach a peak level. I Have Heard The Term \"Half-Life\" Used To Talk About Medications. What Does This Mean? - A medicine's half-life is the time it takes for its level in the blood to be reduced by one-half. - The half-life of each seizure medicine depends on how quickly it is broken down and gotten rid of from the body. - How often a medicine should be taken depends on the drug's half-life. What's the difference between a medicine that has a short half-life and one with a long half-life? - If a medicine has a short half-life, the amount in your blood may quickly become too low to control your seizures. Medicines with short half-lives ideally should be taken several times a day. Then you can take a smaller amount each time and your blood level will stay more stable. - Medicines with long half-lives have more stable levels over a number of hours. This let's the medicine be taken less often. When are seizure medicines most likely to work? Seizure medicines work best when the amount in your system reaches a steady state or constant amount. - To keep this steady or constant amount, the medicine needs to be taken on a regular basis. The amount you take in needs to equal the amount your body gets rid of. - Just because a medicine has reached a steady state doesn't mean that it will control seizures. Only by taking the medicine for a while (usually a number of months) can you tell if the drug is going to work for you. Is It Normal For Blood Levels Of Seizure Medicines To Fluctuate? - Yes, even when someone has been taking the same medication for a long time the amount in your body will change over the course of the day. - Missed doses can also be a reason for why medicine levels change. - Dose-related side effects are more likely to occur at times of the highest (peak) levels and a seizure is more likely to occur at times of the lowest (trough) levels.
