MARK FREILICH If you are intently reading or just skimming through the chapters of this book, the assumption is that your child or a child you know was recently or at some time in the past diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder. At this point you have hopefully, to one degree or another, started to come to terms with the diagnosis and what it means for your child, for you, and for your family. You are now ready to enter the Autism Superhighway, inch by inch, or at full speed. In either case, it is now time to gather your team of co-navigators who will assist you in putting together a GPS system with the appropriate approaches, methods, and interventions. These should all be based on your child's unique and individual profile. This profile is essential in guiding the course of treatment. For any child with autism, determining a course of treatment using only information you have read in a book or researched on the Internet is ill-advised. One needs a qualified team of specialists to properly evaluate, diagnose, prescribe, and monitor your child's strengths and areas of need. This book is intended to provide an overview of a variety of approaches, methods, and interventions that alone or in combination may help place a child on the road to recovery from autism. It needs to be said that at this time there is no cure for autism. There are many children, however, who have received timely and comprehensive interventions and no longer meet the diagnostic criteria for an autism spectrum diagnosis. No matter the severity of manifestations, significant benefit can be gained by the child, the family, or both, with early and intensive interventions. However, if any clinician, specialist, or intervention approach promises a cure, be very leery and scrutinize carefully the validity of these claims. Your primary pediatric care provider should be knowledgeable about the various medical, developmental, and behavioral issues that children with autism spectrum disorders may encounter. They should be aware of the available treatment options and the specialists in your area to whom you need to be referred. They need to be open minded to ALL treatments, whether they are based on a Western medicine approach or an alternative/complementary medical philosophy. Most importantly, there needs to be close collaboration and communication between your family, your specialists/therapists, and your child's primary care pediatric physician. Unfortunately a common etiology for autism has not been discovered. Each child may broadly share common general manifestations but the triggers and causes for these manifestations may vary greatly from one child to another. It appears that the way parents and professionals view autism today is in transition. Although many continue to view it as strictly a psychiatric or a neurologic disorder, newer viewpoints are being embraced. Autism is increasingly being viewed as a disorder with multifactorial etiologies defined by its behavioral manifestations. These include impairments in communication and social interactions, repetitive behaviors, and sensory processing and regulatory issues. Therefore, autism needs to be considered a spectrum disorder that not only is impacted by issues in the brain and nervous system but one that is impacted by dysfunction in the immune, gastrointestinal, and metabolic systems. Since the etiology as well as the manifestations of autism are influenced by a variety of multiple factors, a cookie-cutter or a one-size-fits-all approach to treatment and intervention programming is steering you onto the wrong road. Creating an individual profile is therefore essential to navigating the Autism Superhighway. This profile must include an assessment of the child's present developmental level. It needs to analyze the child's individual medical, genetic, behavioral, sensory processing, and regulatory profile. Consideration of parenting skills, cultural beliefs, and expectations need to be factored in. The child's profile should and will change over time. The key to successful outcomes is establishing a cohesive team approach, with ongoing monitoring of progress to ensure treatments remain relevant and goals are always current and realistic. One cannot promise that the Autism Superhighway your child and your family will be travelling on will offer a smooth or detour-free trip. There will be bumps, curves, and forks in the road. Remember, this is a long journey, not a short road trip. There will be many moments when you think are we there yet? but there will also be many scenic road stops and enjoyable attractions. Be sure to take the time to enjoy the major highlights along the way. \u2014MARK FREILICH, M.D. THERAPIES 1 ALLERGIES, THEIR ROLE AND TREATMENT IN AUTISM BYDr. MARVIN BORISe9781616080259_i0002.jpg Marvin Boris, MD, FAAP, FAAAIA, FACA Autism Associates of New York 77 Froehlich Farm Boulevard Woodbury, NY 11797 (516) 921-3456 Associate Clinical Professor Of Pediatrics, New York University School of Medicine Defeat Autism Now! doctor Fellow, American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Fellow, American Academy of Pediatrics The American Academy of Environmental Medicine Author of over fifty scientific papers Allergy and immunology clinical practice Autism is a complex developmental neurological disease of sensory, behavioral, communication, cognitive, and speech deficits. Many of these symptoms are mediated through inflammatory, autoimmune, and metabolic mechanisms. It has been repeatedly published that children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have marked alterations and elevation of cytokines, the mediators of inflammation and autoimmunity. Many factors may produce alterations in inflammation and autoimmunity, including toxins, pesticides, heavy metals, foods, chemicals, infections, drugs, vaccines, radiation, stress, and allergens. A basic tenet of medicine is to eliminate the underlying cause of the disease, however in many instances the damage has already been done and this is not feasible. As an example, dietary manipulation of foods has, through elimination diets, benefited many children with ASD. Avoidance of most airborne allergens is difficult. Under these circumstances allergy immunotherapy is the method of choice. Allergens affect every cell in the body, since all cells react to the allergen immunoglobulins, especially IgE and IgG. Our interest in children with ASD does not lie with the usual respiratory symptoms of allergy, but in how it affects all the other organ systems. Our group performed and published a study, Pollen Exposure as a Cause for the Deterioration of Neurobehavioral Function in Children with Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder. The effects of pollen exposure were highly significant in producing neuropsychological regression, hyperactivity, and obsessive behaviors in these groups. This illustrated well the neurogenic effects of allergen exposure and not only that the pollens produce the typical itchy eyes, runny noses, and respiratory symptoms. Over the years, one thing I have frequently observed was that many children had behavioral problems when they returned to school in the fall. The school officials said it was psychological. However, when the child was removed from the recently painted, sprayed, or chemically cleaned environment, the symptoms and behaviors disappeared. So obviously these exposures precipitated the adverse behaviors and functioning of the children. Allergy immunotherapy is an effective way to alleviate and prevent many of the environmentally precipitated variations in behavior in children with ASD. Several different modes of testing and treatment are currently available. The conventional standard method utilizes prick or intradermal skin tests to determine if a person reacts to a particular antigen at a predetermined concentration. On the basis of this testing the person is administered buildup allergy injections to the positive results. The usual course requires increasing weekly injections over a period of four to six months to reach a therapeutic level. Here I note several comments about and problems with the standard immunotherapy method. It is the effective method utilized by almost all the allergists in the United States. However this may cause several problems in the autistic population. Bringing the child to the allergist's office for these weekly injections often interferes with the child's educational and therapeutic programs. The time required to achieve an optimal dose is many months. The allergy extracts contain preservatives of phenol or glycerin, which many of the ASD children cannot tolerate. Specific dose therapy is the allergy treatment used in our office. Physicians in the American Academy of Environmental Medicine often treat their patients through this mechanism. The extracts are made in our office from the pure basic ingredient and contain no preservatives. In order to determine the specific antigen dose, serial endpoint testing is performed on the patient. This takes two to three hours. EMLA (Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics) cream is initially applied to the child's upper arms as a local anesthetic, in order to make the treatment more comfortable for the child. A small dose of the allergy extract (e.g., dust, molds, mites, pollens, or animal extract) is injected under the skin and a wheal forms. This wheal is measured, timed for seven to ten minutes, and then measured again. It is considered positive if it grows by more than 2mm in ten minutes' time. This strongest dose that does not produce a significant increase in the size of the wheal is the treatment dose. This is the dose of that antigen that will be placed in the allergy extract. This process is repeated for all the allergens to be tested. All the tested allergens at their specific nonreactive dosage are placed in the individual's specific extract. Since the allergy extract contains the nonreactive dose of the allergen, it is administered at home. Our policy is to give the allergy extract either as a nasal spray or an injection, whichever is easier for the family to administer to the child. The extract is administered on a daily basis. It is supplied in a thirty-dose vial, which has to be refrigerated since there are no preservatives in the vial. Responses to the specific dose therapy are often observed in two to six weeks, not requiring the four- to six-month buildup necessary with standard immunotherapy. The most frequently observed benefits are improvement in behavior, decreased hyperactivity, improved sleeping habits, and better socialization, along with the loss of deterioration during allergy exposures. Serial endpoint testing may be performed to help determine and possibly treat food allergies. Elimination diets are the standard and most effective process to address food sensitivities. Blood test evaluations of food allergies have inconsistent results, and I therefore do not rely on blood testing results. Food testing is utilized on individuals who have difficulties with elimination diets and who need more information on specific foods, or to whom desensitization to foods would be beneficial. Serial endpoint testing is also a provocation test, since many people may exhibit symptoms to the food being tested, providing additional information. Unlike inhalants\u2014where several inhalants may be tested at one time\u2014the foods must be tested one at a time due to the possible provocation reaction. If the food shows a high sensitivity on the testing, it is recommended that it be avoided. The foods with moderate reactions can be placed in a food extract, similar to the inhalants, in order to desensitize the person to those foods. Again, the food extract may be administered using a nasal spray or injection. Using this food desensitization treatment, I have observed over the years that many ASD children could tolerate foods which previously had adverse behavioral effects on them. This can make life more pleasant for the child and for the parent. In summary, ASD is a biomedical disease in which both inhalant and food allergies may precipitate adverse behavioral symptoms. Testing through serial endpoints, both for inhalants and foods\u2014with treatment based upon these results\u2014may improve children and adults with ASD. 2 ANIMAL-ASSISTED INTERVENTIONS AND PERSONS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS BYDr. AUBREYFINEe9781616080259_i0003.jpg Aubrey H. Fine Ed.D. Professor Department of Education CA Poly University 3801 W. Temple Ave. Pomona, CA 91768 ahfine@csupomona.edu Psychologist Dr. Aubrey Fine has been in the field of Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT) for over twenty-five years. He is the editor of the most widely accepted book on the subject, The Handbook on Animal-Assisted Therapy, has had a featured monthly column in Dog Fancy magazine on the human-animal bond entitled The Loving Bond. He has also been a guest on numerous national TV and radio shows including on programs on ABC, Animal Planet, KTLA, and CNN. His newest book, Afternoons with Puppy, released by Purdue University in December, 2007, is a heartwarming account about the evolving relationships and outcomes among a therapist, his therapy animals, and his patients over the course of over two decades. Over this period, he has applied AAT with a variety of children with diverse forms of etiology and has witnessed many moving outcomes as a result of incorporating animals as therapeutic agents. An active faculty member at California State Polytechnic University since 1981, he was awarded the prestigious Wang Award in 2001 for exceptional commitment, dedication, and exemplary contributions within the areas of education and applied sciences. His mother always wanted him to have a dog, but wasn't quite sure how he would react. That is when I got the call. I decided that Magic\u2014a very gentle, calm, and attentive four-year-old golden retriever who seems very comfortable working with all children\u2014would be his best match. She always approaches those with whom she interacts very slowly, giving them ample time to get acclimated to her presence. When they first met, Bob was apprehensive and used poor eye contact. He also mumbled his speech and spoke with a pedantic flair. That didn't seem to be an obstacle for Magic. She moved close to Bob, waiting for him to pet her. Their relationship was just beginning. Over the following weeks, not only did he become more comfortable with her presence, he also began to speak up and with more clarity to everybody. Puppy love and companionship may have been the initial goals, but Bob's family would quickly learn that animal-assisted interventions have much more to offer. Introduction The unique bond between humans and animals and its powerful impact on human well-being have been documented over hundreds of years (Wells, 2009). It is apparent that in most cases, pets fill a void in owners' lives. Instead of coming home to an empty house, people come home to the greetings of happy, loving animals, such as dogs or cats. Our pets provide companionship and unconditional love as well as providing friendship to those who may lack social contact. Within this chapter, attention will be given to explain the value of the human-animal bond, and describe how animal-assisted interventions can be a viable alternative to persons with any autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Before specifically discussing the roles that animals can have with people who have ASD, we'll first explore the value of the human-animal bond and the field of animal-assisted interventions (AAI). Understanding the Human-Animal Bond The American Veterinary Medical Association's Committee on the Human-Animal Bond defines the human-animal bond as, a mutually beneficial and dynamic relationship between people and other animals that is influenced by behaviors that are essential to the health and well-being of both (JAVMA, 1998). Data from the American Veterinary Medical Association (2007) points out that there are about seventy-two million dogs owned in the U.S. As one can imagine, many people in this country spend a great deal of their discretionary funds on their beloved pets. For example, according to American Pet Products Association (2009) $17.4 billion are spent yearly for pet food, and about $12.2 billion are spent on veterinary care. The sense of being needed and of having a purpose in life has been researched by numerous scholars as one of the many reasons why such a bond is established. Some also believe that our relationships with animals provide social supports in vulnerable times, as well as opportunities for healthy interactions. McNicholas and Colis (2000 and 2006) suggest that animals maybe more forgiving than their human counterparts and are more accepting than fellow humans of those who may have awkward social and communication skills. Numerous research studies and papers have also been written over the past few decades that illustrate the unique physiological benefits that animals foster. The roots of these findings go back to the pioneer works of Friedmann, Katcher, and Lynch, (Friedmann et al., 1990) who demonstrated the value of caressing an animal on cardiovascular health, and decreased anxiety because of physical contact with the pet. Since that time, there have been other researchers who have unearthed other specific physiological outcomes that are enhanced due to the bond, such as an increase in oxytocin and other healthy neurotransmitters as a consequence of gently stroking and petting dogs (Odenthal and Meintjes, 2003; and Dayton, 2010). The researchers have found that petting and interacting with the dogs also caused a decrease in cortisol levels (stress hormones). In essence, the research leaves us with an understanding that interacting with animals may be similar to a welcoming spa treatment that promotes a relaxed state. A good synthesis on this literature can be found in a paper written by Wells (2009). Finally, Dayton (2010) also reports on the research of Headey and Grabka that attempted to quantify the health correlates of pet ownership using national survey data in Australia, Germany, and China. Their results suggested that compared with those who didn't have pets, those who live with other species benefit from better overall health, get more exercise, sleep better, take fewer days off work, and see their doctors less. Defining Animal-Assisted Interventions The reputation of AAI has blossomed in the past several decades, ever since Boris Levinson coined the term pet therapy (Levinson, 1969). As a clinician, Levinson suggested that animals could provide a calming effect in therapy. Ever since that time, numerous terms have been used to explain the therapeutic use of animals. Terms such as animal-facilitated counseling, animal-assisted therapy and activities, pet-mediated therapy, and pet psychotherapy have been used interchangeably. Nevertheless, the most widely used terms are animal-assisted therapy and animal-assisted activities. Both could be classified under the rubric of animal-assisted interventions. The Delta Society's Standards of Practice for Animal-Assisted Activities and Therapy defines animal-assisted therapy (AAT) as an intervention with specified goals and objectives delivered by a health or human service professional with specialized expertise in using an animal as an integral part of treatment (Delta Society, 1996). On the other hand, but equally valuable, animal-assisted activities (AAA) occur when specially trained professionals, paraprofessionals, or volunteers accompanied by animals interact with people in a variety of environments (Delta Society, 1996). In AAA, the same activity can be repeated for many different people or groups of people; the interventions are not part of a specific treatment plan and are not designed to address a specific emotional or medical condition; and detailed documentation does not occur. In previous articles (Fine, 2000, 2006), the author has identified several other tenets that he believes are some of the major purposes of incorporating animals as an aspect of therapy. Briefly, two of the tenets are as follows: Tenet 1: Animals as a social lubricant As stated earlier, this tenet has been the primary force behind AAI. The animals act as a social lubricant and ease the stress of therapy by being comforting. The animals also act as a link in conversation between clinician and client, helping to establish trust and rapport between patient and clinician. The mere presence of an animal can also give clients a sense of comfort, which further promotes rapport in the therapeutic relationship. In regards to persons with ASD, the literature does suggest a similar outcome. For example, Martin and Farnum (2002) noted several improvements in children with ASD when they interacted with therapy dogs. It appears that including animals in therapy promoted more playful moods and better attentiveness in the youngsters who participated in the project. Martin and Farnum concluded that these changes in their behavior were a direct consequence of being around the dogs. They also explained that animals are believed to act as transitional objects, allowing children to first establish bonds with them and then extend these bonds to humans (Martin and Farnum, 2002). Tenet 2: Animals as teachers Perhaps one of the strongest outlets for applying AAI is how clinicians have often utilized animals for teaching as well as for role models. This is one of the greatest advantages of incorporating animals into therapy. Teaching animals and supporting their growth can also have therapeutic benefits for the clients. There have been many clinicians who have used the bonding relationship with the animal as a method to enhance developmental skills. For example, in a study with a child with autism, Barol (2006) used the relaxed atmosphere that the dog promoted to teach skills that were normally avoided by the young boy. Prior to the onset of her study, Barol met with the therapeutic team to discuss what sorts of activities they would offer the child, using the therapy dog as a motivational tool. For example, when asked to cut things in occupational therapy, traditionally the boy would often become uncooperative, squeal, and whine. However, when asked to do a similar task when cutting up bacon-like dog treats, he seemed more willing to cooperate. In addition, the speech and language therapist worked with the child to say Here, Henry when he gave the dog the treat. In essence, the responsibility of taking care of the animal seemed to be the impetus for his actions. Pet Companionship and AAI: Suggestions for Applications It is clear that there has been a recent interest in the roles that animals have in the lives of persons with ASD. In fact, in this book, there are separate chapters that highlight the value of service animals as well as that of equine therapy. Both these options also take their roots in the area of the human-animal bond, and are aspects of AAI. The author will not cover these therapies specifically, but would like to reiterate that there is some strong evidence demonstrating the value of both. There also have been a handful of studies in the last decade demonstrating that AAI could be useful in supporting persons with ASD with many of their developmental needs. Ming-Lee Yeh (2008) suggested several interesting outcomes from her three years of research on evaluating a canine animal-assisted therapy (AAT) treatment for children with ASD in Taiwan. She reported significant improvements for the children on the social skills subscale and total score on the VABS (Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale; VABS, Chinese version). She also reported that after interacting with dogs, children revealed significant improvements in various dimensions of communication and language, as well as increasing their on-task behavior. Grandin, Fine, and Bowers (in press) have suggested several reasons why AAI may be more appropriate for some people with ASD, while others may react indifferently. One argument that was made pertains to the fact the some people may respond negatively to their interactions due to sensory oversensitivity. For example, one person with ASD may not be able to tolerate the smell of a dog, while another may have auditory oversensitivity and may not be able to tolerate the sound of a dog barking. The impact of sensory oversensitivity is extremely variable and can have a very strong effect on an interaction. For instance, when Bob first met Magic, he seemed very conscious of how she smelled. Attention was given to bathing her right before his visits with a very neutral-smelling shampoo. On the other hand, a barking dog or a squawking bird may not bother some, while others will find it extremely aversive and offensive. Simply put, some people with various levels of ASD may avoid animals because they have extreme sensitivity to either sound or smell (it may not have anything to do with the animal specifically). One needs to carefully consider this point prior to introducing an animal. On the other hand, some believe that persons with ASD may respond differently to animals due to their differences in cognitive problem solving. For example, Grandin and Johnson (2005) hypothesize that one of the reasons why some children and adults with ASD relate really well to animals is due to sensory-based thinking. They suggest that there may be some similarities in the way that both people with ASD and companion animals process information. In essence, animals do not think in words. They believe that dogs' cognitions are filled with detailed sensory information and their world is filled with pictures, smells, sounds, and physical sensations. Grandin et al. (in press) summarized their impressions about some of the safeguards to consider when utilizing animals in therapy, with the following conclusions. Table 1 summarizes these perceptions. Additionally, AAI can also be applied with individuals who have a milder version of ASD. Perhaps one of the greatest benefits has been how the animals have supported companionship and friendship in the lives of people who have felt very isolated and lonely. In Afternoons with Puppy (2007), Fine and Eisen discussed several cases of youths with Asperger's syndrome and autism and the roles that animals had in their lives. One case that clearly stands out was that of a teenage boy diagnosed with high-functioning autism who had tremendous social skill difficulties. Unfortunately, the boy led a very isolated life until he developed an interest in the birds in my office. Eventually he adopted a bird, and it provided him with compassion and joy. He often would sit next to the bird when he was anxious and upset. The bird seemed to provide him with a blanket of warmth that helped him regulate his anxiety. He also realized the importance of handling the bird gently. They seemed to become protective of each other and enjoyed one another's company. Table 1 Concluding Remarks George Eliot in Mr. Gilfil's Love Story from her book Scenes of Clerical Life (1857), once stated that Animals are such agreeable friends\u2014they ask no questions, they pass no criticisms. Her comments seem very apropos in our concluding remarks for this paper. The love and unconditional regard received from a pet or from a therapy animal may represent a catalyst for emotional and psychological growth. A well-trained therapy animal working alongside a seasoned therapist may be a viable team when used to promote various developmental and functional skills. On the other hand, families may want to consider adopting an animal for companionship. However, one must realize the importance of selecting a compatible pet and the need for effective training. Provisions need to be thought through to support not only the welfare of the person but also the animal. Although AAI shouldn't be unrealistically viewed as a panacea, one should not overlook the power of our connection to animals. We may find some significant benefits derived from this relationship. 3 ANTHROPOSOPHICAL CURATIVE EDUCATION AND SOCIAL THERAPY BY DR. MARGA HOGENBOOM Hogenboom has worked for seventeen years as a general practitioner and school medical officer in The Camphill Medical Practice in Scotland. She specialises in Anthroposophic medicine. The Camphill School Aberdeen has ninety pupils and is accredited by the Autistic Society in the U.K. She is co-author of the books Autism: A Holistic Approach and Living with Genetic Syndromes Associated with Intellectual Disability.e9781616080259_i0006.jpg Paula Moraine, M.Ed. pmoraine@gmail.com Paula Moraine has been an educator for thirty-five years, working with children and adults in classrooms, residential homes, and universities. She is currently the Director of the Community Outreach Center for Literacy and Tutoring Program in Bel Air, Maryland. History: In 1924, when attitudes toward people with special needs were radically different than they are today, Rudolf Steiner gave a seminal course of lectures to a small group of teachers and doctors, forming a fundamental basis for the Anthroposophically inspired curative work for individuals with special needs. Many decades later, the Anthroposophical curative movement has grown enormously, with more than six hundred centers and homes around the world for both children and adults. These day and residential schools practice curative education, an approach which combines education, therapy, and medicine with a strong emphasis on daily experiences of nature and the seasons of the year. In the centers for adults this curative approach is often referred to as Social Therapy. In these homes and schools, more than 50 percent of the children or adults will have autistim spectrum disorder (ASD), ranging from high-functioning autism to individuals who are dependent on others for their everyday care. This mix of disabilities and abilities is welcomed by the many Anthroposophical Curative Education and Social Therapy centers, and is viewed as a special strength that enhances social interaction. Philosophy The thought underlying Anthroposophical Curative Education and Social Therapy is that every human being has an eternal, healthy individuality. At birth, a human being incarnates into a physical body and an individual life, merging the eternal individuality with the earthly incarnation. The Anthroposophical basis of Curative Education and Social Therapy is guided by fundamental principles of Anthroposophy that includes the understanding of the human being as having a body (physical body), soul, and spirit that express through a fourfold organization of physical body, etheric body (life forces), astral body (feelings and emotional forces), and ego (the sense of I). As a child develops, he or she begins to feel at home in the body through a full spectrum of sense experiences that goes beyond the usual five senses, extending to twelve senses as described by Rudolf Steiner: the senses of touch, life (well-being), self-movement, balance, smell, taste, sight, warmth/temperature, hearing, language, concept, and ego. Children with atypical development\u2014caused by genetic factors, birth trauma, illness, neglect, or abuse\u2014will have difficulties fully integrating in their bodies. It is not known what causes ASD, despite intensive research. Each child on the autism spectrum will be unique and different, but may manifest similar difficulties in the twelve senses. The ASD child will often have increased sensitivity in the sense of touch, which provides us a feeling of our self or safety. They can be oversensitive to touch and even ticklish, but normal touch can be difficult for them. Curative education approaches this sensitivity therapeutically, through massage, applying etheric oils to the children, surrounding the children with natural materials, and helping the children to experience the natural world through touch. For children with ASD, the sense of well-being is often disturbed. The child may sleep poorly, have irregular bowel movements, strange eating habits, or can look pale and uncomfortable. Curative education emphasizes improvement in the sense of well-being through an ordered, rhythmical day, gentle sense impressions, limited exposure to media, frequent outdoor activities, and healthy natural food. Parents often notice the first area of improvement for the ASD child in a curative home is a regular sleeping rhythm. The well-developed sense of movement and balance appears in children with Kanner's autism. These children can balance on a fence, can run, and have agility for a variety of activities. On closer observation it is clear that those are not free movements; the child cannot express his or her personality through these movements. In a curative school, there will be many opportunities throughout the day to replace these compulsive movements with outdoor play, clapping games, folk dancing, sports, horseback riding, or swimming. We relate to the world around us through what we taste, smell, see, and through feeling warmth. All this information helps us to make sense of the world. The child with ASD often finds these normal sensory experiences overwhelming, painful, and confusing. Sounds can be distorted and too loud, visual impressions are disconnected, and taste is so acute their food intake will be limited. Those overwhelming sense impressions limit the possibility to really experience what happens in the world, and the child closes off from the world. The child with ASD does not seem to feel well in their physical body, and indicates they are overwhelmed by sensory input. So how can curative education help these children? Through working with the twelve senses, within an organized and consistent approach, the child with ASD can gradually lean to relax, deal with their sense impressions more effectively, and eventually recognize others as separate from themselves. This is the beginning of the experience of self as a separate individuality. The schools for Curative Education are based on the principles and practices of Waldorf Education, as established by Rudolf Steiner in 1919. Waldorf Education is based on the principle that the body, soul, and spirit of the individual child can be guided and educated through carefully balancing the education of the child's thinking, feeling, and will. This is accomplished using an articulated curriculum based on insights into the development of the child, and an evolving engagement of the developing thinking, feeling, and will of the child. The education in Anthroposophical curative schools is based on the Waldorf curriculum, adapted to support children with a variety of special educational needs. Therapies form an integral part of daily life in the curative schools that might include play therapy, music therapy, art therapy, movement therapy, massage therapy, color/light therapy, baths and aroma therapy, and horseback riding therapy. Daily life for each child will be a mixture of educational and therapeutic activities that work together to bring about an integration of the child's physical, cognitive, and sensory capacities. Each child is allowed to develop along an individual path, so teachers and therapists are trained to be intuitive, responsive, and diagnostic with each child. The integrated approach to education, therapy, and medicine makes Anthroposophical Curative Education and Social Therapy interdisciplinary and multimodal. Collaboration among teachers, doctors, therapists, social workers, and parents is developed to a high degree in curative homes and schools. In the curative home, the element of the family setting is added to the school day and to therapeutic hours. The child relies on consistency in all parts of their day, and the curative home is organized to provide smooth, seamless transitions between the various areas of the child's daily experience. The same is true for curative homes for adults, though the daily schedule is adapted in respect for the adults' maturity. Best-case scenario James, an eight-year-old boy, attends the Camphill School as a boarder. He is a very oversensitive child on the autism spectrum, he has poor sleep, no speech, and exhibits obsessive behaviour. His parents are exhausted and describe a difficult home life due to his many needs. Ten years later, he is a young man with reasonable speech, using full sentences, and engaging in simple conversations. His speech is still developing, he has learned many practical skills, remembers people, and relates to people. Although his progress is impressive, he still needs a protected environment. Parents often note important changes in their very disabled children. Although these children may never learn to speak, and though they will need life-long care, the parents notice that their child recognizes them and appears more peaceful in general. Worst-case scenario Camphill Schools integrate children of all abilities and do not have closed units. Some children with ASD can have unpredictable, or even dangerous behaviour, which can put frail children at risk despite close supervision. The Camphill Schools are not a viable option for these children. Students with high-functioning autism often progress through the curative school acquiring adequate skills and capacities for work in other settings. These children often live at home or in groups with others, and engage in various work settings. Training and Research There is currently no substantive research available for the effect of the Anthroposophical Curative Education approach to children with ASD or pervasive developmental disorder (PDD). There is, however, a BA in Curative Education available through the University of Aberdeen, Scotland, offered to the teachers and therapists working in the Scottish Camphill curative schools. By paying special attention to these senses and creating specific experiences throughout the day to protect and enhance these senses, Curative Education takes on a quality of healing that supports the person with autism. There is also training in curative education available in the U.S. through the Camphill centers in Pennsylvania. Although empirical research is not available, there is a wealth of experience and practice that informs the ongoing work in curative schools, and could help form future research to reveal the effects of integrating education, therapy, and medicine in addressing the special challenges and opportunities presented by ASD. A full description of these twelve senses and how they are incorporated into education, therapy, and medicine can be found in the book, Autism: A Holistic Approach (2001) by Bob Woodward and Dr. Marga Hogenboom. A full description of how these principles are implemented is given in this book. In Holistic Special Education, edited by Robin Jackson, the practice of creating a therapeutic education and experience for the children in curative schools and homes is described.

Frye received his medical degree from Georgetown University. He completed his pediatric residency training at University of Miami and child neurology residency training at Children's Hospital Boston. Following residency, Dr. Frye completed a fellowship in behavioral neurology and learning disabilities at Children's Hospital Boston. Dr. Frye completed a Ph.D. in physiology and biophysics at Georgetown University and a MS in biomedical science at Drexel University. Dr. Frye is board certified in Pediatrics and in Neurology with special competency in Child Neurology. Dr. Frye is also funded by the National Institutes of Health to study brain function in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. Dr. Frye is the medical director of the University of Texas medically based autism clinic. The purpose of this unique clinic is to diagnose and treat medical disorders associated with autism, such as mitochondrial disorders and subclinical electrical discharges, in order to optimize remediation and recovery. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have many applications in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). These include the control of seizures and epilepsy; treatment of epileptic encephalopathies such as Landau-Kleffner syndrome, electrical status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep and subclinical electrical discharges; behavioral and mood regulation; migraine headaches; and periodic leg movements during sleep. When a child has more than one of these medical disorders, it is possible to select an AED that will treat several conditions simultaneously. Some of the more recently introduced AEDs such as felbamate have not gained wide enough use in ASD to determine whether they are efficacious in ASD. Seizures Syndromes: Individuals with epilepsy related to a specific epilepsy syndrome, such as tuberous sclerosis, should be treated with AEDs that are effective for treating the specific underlying epilepsy syndrome. Emergency Seizure Treatment: Rectal diazepam is very effective to treat prolonged seizure activity and should be prescribed to individuals with epilepsy or seizures that are at risk for such a prolonged seizure. Epileptic Encephalopathy: AEDs have been more extensively studied for the classically recognized epileptic encephalopathies, specifically Landau-Kleffner syndrome and electrical status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep, than the less well-characterized syndromes such as subclinical electrical discharges. In general, the same medications appear to be just as effective for the all the epileptic encephalopathies. Valproate has efficacy in some cases and may be the initial treatment choice. Occasionally, oxcarbazepine may be helpful for very focal electrical discharges. Immunomodulatory treatments, specifically steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin, may also be helpful adjunctive treatments for these syndromes. For electrical status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep, diazepam prior to sleep has also been used. Behavior and Mood Regulation: Valproate and lamotrigine are particularly effective in mood regulation, while topiramate appears to be effective for reducing impulsivity and aggressive behavior. Migraine Headaches: Valproate, gabapentin, and topiramate have been very effective in treating migraine headaches, with topiramate being particularly effective. Periodic Leg Movements During Sleep: Gabapentin can be useful for treating period leg movements during sleep, especially if there is trouble with sleep initiation. AEDs were originally developed to control the abnormal electrical activity in the brain association with seizures and epilepsy. Other applications of these medications have been developed, including the use of AEDs in migraine headaches, sleep disorders, and mood stabilization and behavioral regulation in psychiatric disorders. Given their success in psychiatric and neurological disorders, they have been applied to individuals with ASD for similar indications. Success is variable and depends on the indication for treatment. In some cases, dramatic results occur with AED treatment. It is best to select the most likely medication for the indication that will produce minimal side effects based on the profile of the patient. Poor results with AED treatment should lead to the consideration of alternative therapies, or to prompt the investigation of underlying medical disorders that have not been investigated. For example, poor success for behavioral control with an AED might prompt the investigation of gastrointestinal symptoms that are not obvious, or a trial of psychoactive medications. Seizures-like events that do not respond to AEDs should be reviewed carefully. If a video electroencephalograph has confirmed an electrographic correlate to the clinical behavior, more extensive metabolic or neuroimaging investigations might be indicated. Side effects of AEDs highly depend on the medication. In general, newer AEDs (lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, levetiracetam) have fewer older AEDs (phenobarbitol, phenytoin, primidone, carbamazepine). The exception to this is valproate, which appears to have good efficacy for many indications that affect children with ASD. The side effects profiles have not been studied in ASD specifically, so it is not known whether children with ASD have a higher incidence of side effects than other populations of children. In general, almost all AEDs can cause neurological side effects (ataxia, tremor, nystagmus), behavioral side effects (hyperactivity, agitation, aggressiveness), gastrointestinal side effects (abdominal pain, nausea), and an allergic reaction which can be severe in some cases. As discussed below, the incidence of side effects varies with the specific AED used, and the more serious side effects can be avoided with careful monitoring. Thus, it is best to have a practitioner with experience in these medications prescribe the AED and monitor the patient. In general, it is best to avoid older AEDs (phenobarbitol, phenytoin, primidone) that have a high incidence of cognitive and neurological side effects, as such side effects can exacerbate behavioral and cognitive abnormalities associated with ASD. Care should also be taken when using multiple AEDs. Since almost all AEDs elevate the rate of birth defects, it is important to carefully consider the choice of AEDs in potentially sexually active females. There are specific side effects that every practitioner should be aware of and should communicate to the patient when prescribing AED medication: Valproate: Valproate can result in serious side effects. However, valproate has remained one of the most widely used AEDs for ASD due to its efficacy, the relatively low incidence of serious side effects, and the ability to detect serious side effects with careful monitoring. The most serious side effects are hepatotoxicity, hyperammonemia, and pancreatitis. Several precautions can be taken to prevent these side effects from occurring. In general, a complete blood count, liver function tests, and amylase and lipase should be monitored during the initial period of starting the medication, and if the patient experiences gastrointestinal symptoms. Once a stable dose has been selected, the patient can be monitored approximately every three months. Hepatotoxicity is believe to be more prevalent in children under two years of age, so it is best to avoid prescribing valproate to very young children. Carnitine can help with the metabolism of valproate and may mitigate hepatotoxicity. Thus, cotreatment with carnitine is recommended. Common side effects of valproate include weight gain and thinning of the hair. The latter is believed to respond to selenium (10-20 mcg per day) and zinc (25-50 mg per day). Long-term use of valproate has been linked to bone loss, irregular menstruation, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Lamotrigine: Lamotrigine has a low incidence of serious side effects and is generally well-tolerated. The most serious side effect of lamotrigine is a life-threatening rash known as Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Increasing the lamotrigine dose slowly toward the target dose can reduce the risk of this reaction occurring. Any parent or patient should be alerted to look for this adverse reaction. Steroids: Common side effects include weight gain, edema, mood instability, and insomnia. Serious side effects include hypertension, immunosuppression, gastrointestinal ulceration, and glucose instability. Anyone on steroids should be closely monitored, especially if steroids are used for an extended period of time. Intravenous Immunoglobulin: Common reactions include rash, headache, and fever, requiring prophylactic pretreatment for these side effects in some patients. This treatment is contraindicated in individuals with kidney or heart problems and should be administered by a practitioner familiar with the treatment. Oxcarbazepine: Hyponatremia can develop in some individuals. Topiramate: Common side effects include weight loss and cognitive and psychomotor slowing. Topiramate is minimally metabolized by the liver and is excreted mostly unchanged by the kidneys. Topiramate can cause a metabolic acidosis, nephrolithiasis, and oligohidrosis. Thus, this medicine should be avoided in individuals with kidney disorders, and parents and patients should be careful in hot weather. Glaucoma has occurred in rare cases, so any vision symptoms should be considered carefully. Levetiracetam: Overall, levetiracetam has a low incidence of serious side effects and has minimal effects on liver metabolism. The most prevalent side effects are behavioral, and include agitation, aggressive behavior, and mood instability. Levetiracetam has been linked to suicide in a few individuals without ASD. Preliminary reports suggest that cotreatment with pyridoxine helps mitigate behavioral side effects. Diazepam: The most common reaction is drowsiness. Respiratory depression can occur if given at high doses. Vigabatrin: Vigabatrin is associated with a progressive and permanent visual loss. Thus, its use is usually restricted to control of seizures in tuberous sclerosis. Children with ASD have a high incidence of medical disorders that may guide the practitioner to choose a particular AED. 5 ANTIFUNGAL TREATMENT BY DR.

Overview. The reduction in amount of fungi in the digestive tract is part of a larger group of interventions commonly called biological therapies. In this review, we will focus on the evidence for fungal involvement in the symptoms of autistic children, discuss the ways in which the amount of fungi in the gut can be reduced, and review the evidence that exists to support these practices. Autism and Digestive Difficulties Children diagnosed with autism do have considerable digestive difficulties. In 2003, Rosseneu studied eighty children diagnosed with autism who also had digestive symptoms, finding that 61 percent had abnormal gram negative endotoxin-producing bacteria, 55 percent had overgrowth of Staphylococcus aureus and 95 percent had an overgrowth of Escherichia coli. He did not find abnormal amounts of fungus. Candida Overgrowth The main fungal culprit implicated in autism is Candida albicans (Edelson, 2006). Generally this fungus is kept under control by the bacteria that live within the gut. However, exposure to antibiotics can kill these bacteria resulting in a proliferation of Candida. It lives on the moist dark mucous membranes which line the mouth, vagina, and intestinal tract. Ordinarily it exists only in small colonies, prevented from growing too rapidly by the human host's immune system, and by competition from other microorganisms in and on the body's mucous membranes. When something happens to upset this delicate natural balance, Candida can grow rapidly and aggressively, causing many unpleasant symptoms to the host. Vaginal yeast infections present the most common case in point. High levels of Candida are thought to release toxins which are absorbed into the bloodstream through the blood, thereby causing difficulties. Edelson links an overgrowth of Candida to confusion, hyperactivity, short attention span, lethargy, irritability, and aggression. He further cites headaches, abdominal pain, constipation, excess gas, fatigue, and depression as linked to Candida overgrowth. Support for the Candida overgrowth theory is often sought in the observation that people treated for Candida become worse for two to three days before becoming better. This worsening is supposed to relate to die-off of the yeast. As the fungi die, their cell walls open, releasing the intracellular contents into the gut. Some components of this intracellular material are thought to be cause symptoms in humans. Further proof is offered in the form of organic acid analysis of the urine. When organic acids are found in the urine that are only produced by yeast, presumably the yeast are releasing these acids into the gut to pass through the gut wall into the bloodstream to be removed by the kidneys. Popular books on Candida include William Crook's The Yeast Connection Handbook. Organic acid urine testing is performed at The Great Plains Laboratory in Overland Park, Kansas. Many children afflicted with autism have had frequent ear infections as young children and have taken large amounts of antibiotics. These are thought to exaggerate the yeast problem. Other possible contributors to Candida overgrowth are hormonal treatments; immunosuppressant drug therapy; exposure to herpes, chicken pox, or other chronic viruses; or exposure to chemicals that might upset the immune system. Another reported reason for fungal overgrowth is a faulty immune system. A relationship between autism and immunity was proposed over forty years ago based on the detection of autoimmune conditions in family members of children diagnosed with autism (Money et al., 1971; Ashwood et al., 2004. Pardo and Eberhart, 2007). Numerous scientific reports of immune abnormalities in people with autism have been published (Ashwood and Van de Water, 2004, Hornig and Lipkin, 2001). These include defects in antibody production, imbalances between the different parts of the immune system, and higher rates of infections in children diagnosed with autism. The production of lymphocytes has been found to be decreased (Stubbs & Crawford, 1976). A year later, Stubbs (1977) supported an altered immune response among five of thirteen autistic children who had undetectable titers despite previous rubella vaccine, while all control children had detectable titers. This finding of undetectable titers in autistic children suggests these children may have an altered immune response. Children diagnosed with autism do not always respond to vaccination, having no evidence of being immunized a year after a rubella vaccine was given. In one study, 46 percent of families of children diagnosed with autism have two or more members with autoimmune disorders such as type I diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, hypothyroidism, and lupus (Pardo & Eberhart, 2007). Antibodies have been found in children diagnosed with autism against their own nerves and their myelin covering, nerve receptors, and even brain parts (Jepson, 2007). The commonly recognized clumsiness of many autistic children has been linked to antibodies attacking the Purkinje cells in the cerebellum (Rout and Dhossche, 2008) which are the cells that control coordinated movements. Inflammation has been found in the brains of children with autism (Vargas et al, 2005). Once we eliminated barley malt and all other malted products (maltodextrin, malted barley flour, and so on), vinegar, and yeast, the improvement was dramatic. We began to see the light at the end of the tunnel, but little did we know how long that tunnel was. Reaching the end of the tunnel is still a goal, although after more than eight years, we are much closer. Eight years ago, simply decreasing Avi's headaches to once a week or once every two weeks, and seeing his behavior improve and his autistic symptoms decrease, were major victories. We had turned the tide before we lost Avi altogether. He was coming back to us, very, very slowly. It took two more years, and much more experimentation, to completely eliminate Avi's debilitating headaches. Another two years of experimentation eliminated Avi's eczema and itching. Oxalic Acid and Yeast Oxalate and its acid form oxalic acid are organic acids that are primarily from three sources: the diet, from fungus such as Aspergillus and Penicillium and Candida (Fomina et al, 2005, Ruijter et al, 1999; Takeuchi et al, 1987), and from human metabolism (Ghio et al, 2000). Researcher Susan Owens discovered that the use of a diet low in oxalates markedly reduced symptoms in children with autism and PDD. For example, a mother with a son with autism reported that he became more focused and calm, that he played better, that he walked better, and had a reduction in leg and feet pain after being on a low-oxalate diet. Prior to the low-oxalate diet, her "}
