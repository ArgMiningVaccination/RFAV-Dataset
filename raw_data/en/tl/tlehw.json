Helps to cleanse and fine-tune the energy body. In order to have the best possible result, we must work comprehensively on the soul-mind-body, which is why I include in addition to homeopathic and energy therapy. During the first consultation, which usually lasts 120 minutes, we will discuss your health history and everything about your health so far. \"Capturing a case\" means that I will review your symptoms, health history, diet and habits and other topics that at first glance seem strange to those unfamiliar with homeopathy. The reason for this way of working is that we - as homeopaths - need a complete information picture to find the source of the condition and prescribe adequate treatment tailored to you and your needs. In addition, I will add the appropriate energy treatment to suit your needs. The re-examination is done about 3 months (\u00a3 180.00) after treatment is prescribed. Depending on the patient and his condition, it can be performed earlier. The consultation lasts 90 minutes, during which we will discuss and review changes in your condition and symptoms during treatment. The number of consultations varies and depends on individual needs and factors such as age, condition and previous treatments. What do I promise? - To dedicate this time entirely to you - To be honest and as useful as possible - Confidentiality - All information remains between us and the Creator. What do I want from you? - Accuracy - My time is priceless. My schedule is full months ahead, and if you're late, you're hurting yourself. Please be accurate! - To be ready for a positive change - I give home and specific actions that will lead you to the desired result - I reserve the right to refuse to work with you if you do not make enough zeal for the desired change. It is important for me that you are healthy "}
