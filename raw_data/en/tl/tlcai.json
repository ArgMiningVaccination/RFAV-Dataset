I enjoy managing the complex interplay of cardiac disease, anesthetic technique, and the child's response to surgery, ensuring safe outcomes and a rapid return to pain-free, baseline activity.\" - - Dr. Latham is thorough, kind and gentle with kids. We've had Dr. Latham as our anesthesiologist for two consecutive surgeries and he's warm, friendly and easy to talk to. It's nice to see a face you recognize, that your child recognizes from heart surgery to oral surgery. He's been fabulous to work with and have as a member of my son's medical team. Bryton and I thank you Dr Latham! - - Award Name Award Description Awarded By Award Date Teacher of the Year Award Unanimous selection by 2016-2017 pediatric anesthesia fellows, Seattle Children's Hospital July 2016 - 2017 Golden Seed Award Univerisity of Washington Department of Anesthesiology 2011 - 2012 Dean's List 1995 Undergraduate Summer Research Grant University of Kansas School of Medicine 1994 The Annual Undergraduate Cancer Research Award Kansas State University.
