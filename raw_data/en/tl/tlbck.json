Happy? Relaxed? You probably already know that aromas can have a major impact on your mood. Aromatherapy takes this a step further and uses scents to affect a person's physical and mental health and well-being. Aromatherapy is a natural treatment system based on the use of aromatic essential oils. Essential oils are extracted from flowers, fruits, leaves, bark, and roots by methods such as steam distillation. Specific oils are used based on each individual's needs. He or she may dilute these essential oils and massage them into the skin, put them in diffusers so that the vapors can be inhaled, or prepare them in a solution designed for ingestion. Below are a few symptoms that appear when a Spleen/Stomach disharmony is present. If you say yes to a few of these, you may want to look into using some of these aromatherapy oils to support your Spleen/Stomach, and possibly also schedule an acupuncture tune-up: Essential oils that support the Spleen and Stomach include: Caraway: Strengthens the Spleen yang energy, and promotes the flow of qi in the Stomach and Intestines. This helps to alleviate spasms in the digestive tract to aid digestion, and facilitates the transformation of fluids to prevent the formation of damp and phlegm. Cardamom: Stimulates the movement of Stomach Qi to relieve any digestive upset, and strengthens the Spleen Qi to help with lethargy, poor appetite and loose stools. Cardamom is also good for concentration, overthinking and worry. Coriander: Stimulates the movement of Qi-energy in the Stomach and intestines to relieve any digestive upset. Coriander also strengthens the Spleen Qi and invigorates the Intellect (Yi), which makes it helpful for mental fatigue and nervous exhaustion. Fennel: Stimulates the flow of Qi in the Stomach and Intestines to relieve indigestion, bloating, nausea, belching and flatulence. Fennel also frees the Intellect (Yi) so that we can express ourselves with words and feelings rather than churning over them inside. Ginger: Well known to help relieve nausea and painful digestion, Ginger does so by stimulating and strengthening the yang Qi of the Spleen and Stomach. Lemon: Clears dampness and phlegm by strengthening the Spleen Qi, thus acts as a lymphatic decongestent to detox the body and support the immune system. Lemon uplifts the Intellect (Yi) and so sharpens the focus of consciousness, disperses confusion and eases worry. Patchouli: Strengthens the Spleen Qi to assist people suffering from fatigue, loose stools and bloating. Harmonises the Earth element and the Intellect (Yi), therefore grounding those who tend to overthink and worry. Peppermint: Stimulates the flow of Qi in the Stomach and Intestines, and is one of the most effective oils for relieving symptoms of the digestive system. Peppermint also invigorates the mind and the Intellect (Yi) to enhance concentration and the absorption of new ideas and impressions. I hope this has provided you with some inspiration into how to support your body and mind naturally. If you have any questions or comments, please leave them below.
