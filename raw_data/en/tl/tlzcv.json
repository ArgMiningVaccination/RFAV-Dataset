There were seventeen provers (14 women and 3 men). Introduction For those homeopaths familiar with Edward Bach's flower essences Holly is very well know. When I started out in general practice, treating children and animals more frequently than adults, Holly was one of my mainstays alongside polycrests such as Nux vomica, Pulsatilla and Natrum mur. As you will doubtless know the indication for Holly rest upon it's capacity to reconnect the sufferer with the light , turning hate to love, for instance when the subject is f eeling jealous, envious, suspicious, bitter and angry. How astonishing then, that homeopathic Materia medica's have so little to teach us. Boericke who has more to say than most, comments: Intermittent fever. Marked eye symptoms. Spleen pain. All symptoms better in winter. Infiltration of cornea; staphyl oma; nightly burning in orbits, rheumatic inflammation of eye. Pilosis. A few years back I collected both male and female flowers, placing them under vodka in a medicine bottle. To this I added three partly crushed burrs. While crushing these I split the mortar. The pestle's blows focused by the hard wood of the gall cracked the bowl. I had not taken the extreme density of the slow growing wood into account. The wood of Holly was used in joinery, cabinet making, engineering, the making of mathematical instruments, wood engraving and veneering , and was fashioned to provide bobbins for the cotton mills of Lancashire. Below is the source substance the homeopathic proving was derived from 30c potency of burr wood and flowers : Following th e taking of the proving substace the provers did a meditation, during the meditation Mani had an image of someone coming into the room, a stranger. He asked them what they saw. 'They see a green leaf in the middle of the room, it is large and it is sha ped like a dragon. Strong and powerful. Dragons fly and they breath fire '. The mythical dragon is an interesting metorphor for Holly as they are depicted as brave, strong and defient, yet at the same time calm and carfree - they do as they please and have a se nse of independence. Yet they are solitary creatures, living alone - detached. Often there is something precious they are protecting and that they will defend with anger and violence. These ideas are all key themes of the proving. Myths & Legends of the Holly Tree The Holy holly at Glastonbury, Somerset, with prayers hung on its bows. Because the fruit of the Holly Ilex aquifolium is largest & brightest in winter, & the sharp leaves are evergreen, the holly has always been associated with wint er magic. Throughout Europe holly was believed to repel evil, & this belief lingers to the modern day. An old tradition of bringing holy boughs into one's house in winter, as a place for good fairies to play, is echoed down to our own era, when holly wre aths are brought indoors for Christmas, to await the arrival of the winter elf king Santa. It was long regarded as unlucky to leave these holly wreaths up after Twelfth Night, so it was consigned to the fireplace on New Year's Eve. Others felt that good l uck could be obtained by keeping a sprig from a holly wreath that had been used as a Yuletide decoration within a church, hence the wreathes would be cut to pieces to divide among church members. The Celts of the British Isles & Gaul believed the Holly Ki ng ruled over death & winter, whereas the Oak King ruled life & summer. This ancient (conceivably originally Druidic) belief was preserved into medieval times in mummers' plays, & has modernly been adapted to the Druidic revival & other pagan systems of fa ith. The Holly King was a warlike giant who bore a great wooden club made of a thick holly branch. He found his way into Arthurian Legend as the Green Knight, who challenged Sir Gawain during a Yuletide feast, baring as his weapon \"a solitary branch of hol ly.\" It is also noteworthy that in the art of heraldry holly represents truth. The Holly speaks to the fierce capacity of the human soul to take the descent into the underworld, bringing inner light into darkness. Thus we can understand the signature of the tree, with its ability to germinate without sunlight, favoring dark, moist conditions that are more strongly related to the downward earth pole. Its stiff, pointed leaves are not unlike thorns or \"spears.\" The Holly yields a hard, white cl ose- grained wood that imparts a quality of solidity and impermeability, as it stands in the depths of winter, impervious to cold and darkness with its somber evergreen color. Of all the trees in the Ogham, the Holly and the Oak are most primordial \u2014they are viewed as two \"kings\" who exchange leadership on a yearly basis by engaging in symbolic battle. The Gaelic name for Holly \u2014Tinne\u2014 is related to the word, tanist, meaning \"dark twin.\" The Oak King rules from the time the light begins its ascent in December u ntil the summer solstice in June. Holly is the \"dark twin\" who reigns during the waning light of the year, until winter solstice. In Scandinavian mythology the Holly belonged to Thor & Freya. Holly's association with Thor's lightning meant that it could p rotect people from being struck by bolts. Norsemen & Celts would plant a holly tree near their homes specifically to take lightning strikes & protect a house & its inhabitants. The crooked lines of the holly leaves probably gave rise to the association wit h lightning, as well as the fact that hollies do conduct lightning into the ground better than most trees, with the least injury to the tree. So too Freya or Frigga had authority over weather, & if Thor was the lightning, Freya was the thunder. The Grimms' Fairy Tale of \"Mother Holly\" (or \"Frau Holda\") is a recollection of Frigga compounded with an even more ancient Earthmother named Hulta \"Elderberry\". In the charming tale of Mother Holly, her troublemaking cat sets off all sorts of bad weather by gettin g into Mother Holly's things. He then eats Mother Holly's corn. When Mother Holly discovers the mischief the cat has done, she doesn't punish the cat, because the corn caused the kitty's stomach to rumble as with thunder, a sound that pleased her. Althoug h Mother Holly of the Grimms' tale is a winter hag or witch associated with the holly because it is a winter fruit -baring tree, she also had a maidenly spring & summer aspect, when she was associated with the Elderberry Tree which flowers in spring & fruit s in summer. As Frau Holda, then, she is identifiable not just with Teutonic Frigga, but with the Scandinavian goddess Hulda or Hulta. Much of Freya's holly mythology at a more archaic level regarded Hulda's two aspects of maidenly life-giving (with the edible summer- fruiting Elderberry) & crone death -bringing (with the poisonous winter -fruiting Holly). That Holly should be sacred to a God & a Goddess is natural enough when the trees themselves are of two sexes. An old Germanic tradition has it that when t he household's Christmas wreath is made of a \"he- holly,\" that indicated that for the coming year, the husband would rule the house. But if it were a she- holly (& for sake of the berries, it usually was a she -holly), that meant the wife would rule the house. As wives usually do! In Shinto mythology the Japanese holly ( I. crenata ) held a similar position as that of the holly in Europe. When the Sun -goddess Amaterasu withdrew into her cavern & refused to come out, the erotic clown -goddess Uzume hung a sacred jewel & a sacred mirror in the branches of a holly, & began to dance about the black -fruited holly tree in a humorously sexy manner to attract the attention of Amaterasu & draw her out of the cavern so that Spring would begin. A luck -charm is down to the present day sold in Japan, consisting of a glass ball etched with holly lea ves, symbolic of Amaterasu's mirror, jewel, & tree. A New Years charm popular in Japan consists of a holly leaf & skewer. This represents the Buddhist monk -god Daikoku. Once when he was about to be attacked by an oni devil, the rat that dwelt with Daikoku as a friendly companion hurried into the garden to fetch the monk a holly branch, bringing it to him in the nick of time, since an oni devil will not go near holly. To this day, there lingers a rustic Japanese tradition of hanging a holly sprig on th e door to the house to keep away devils, not at all unlike numerous holly- related beliefs in Europe. Holly myths occurred everywhere, usually but not exclusively associated with winter. Chinese households were decorated with I. chinensis during February N ew Years festivals. Even in North America before the coming of the whites, the American Holy (I. opaca) was symbolic of courage & defense. It was encouraged to grow around Indian encampments & homes to protect the tribe, & sprigs of holy would be attached to warshields. In the American southeast & southwest, yaupon holly (I. vomitoria) was used in mystic cultic practices, overimbibed to induce vomiting & hallucination as a purification ritual. Archeologists have found ritual shell -cups with the evaporated holly residue dating to 1,200 BCE. There are only intimations of what the yaupon holly myths within this ancient cult may have been, but it was sacred to the Cherokee & Creek at least into the 1930s, so I wouldn't be at all surprised if the traditions are still known by some First Peoples who don't share their religious practices with over -curious anthropologists. In South America, the Guarada people tell the tale of the bearded god Pa -i-shume who taught many things to mortals, including how to make the stimulating & health- giving mate beverage from the leaves of the Paraguay holly tree (I. paraguayensis). Considering how widespread holly mythology is, the Romans may have independently regarded the holly as sacred, but it is more likely they coopted its ritualistic use from the Celts, hanging winter sprigs upon images of Saturn during winter's violently erotic Saturnalia. Later still Roman Christians coopted the holly into Christian lore. Holly was believed formerly to have been deciduous, until Herod's soldiers came to slay the baby Jesus. At Mary's request, the holly tree regained its leaves in winter so that her infant could be hidden in the foliage. Another Christian holly legend states that the berries had once been white, until touched by the blo od of Jesus when a holly wreath served as his martyr's crown. The Holly is notably absent from Jewish & Islamic tree lore, as it was not native to Israel or Arabia, is not legitimately referred to in Torah or the Koran, & had strong European pagan associa tions. But early Christians brought holly mythology full circle when following Rome into the British Isles. The tree's association with druidry or elves was easily transfered to the new religion, so that the sacredness of the much- legended Holly stands uni nterupted even to our modern age with its association with the birthday of Jesus & with Santa Claus, himself an elf king dwelling in the coldest most deathly & distant part of the earth. Toxicity Holly can contain caffeic acid , caffeoyl . Holly berries can cause vomiting and diarrhea. They are especially dangerous in cases involving accidental consumpt ion by children attracted to the bright red berries. Ingestion of over 20 berries may be fatal to children. [24][25] Holly leaves if eaten might cause diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and stomach and intestinal problems. Holly plants might be toxic to pets and livestock. Leaves of some holly species are (or were) used by some cultures to make daily tea. These species are Yerba other species, such as gallberry ( I. glabra) are bitter and emetic. In general little is known about inter- species variation in constituents or toxicity of hollies. The Bach Flower Essence Holly holds a c entral position among the Bach Flower Remedies, because it embodies love - the highest energy quality through which we all live, and which is our greatest healing power. The desire for love is programmed into every cell of our being, and when we are going with the stream of love we live in a state of grace. However, when the need to give and receive love is denied, the negative Holly state emerges. The personality will experience such extreme disappointment that love is expressed as its opposite - in jealousy, hatred, envy, resentment, malice, and a desire for revenge. While everyone experiences these emotions at some time, in the negative Holly state they are prevalent, and can form the emotional basis for serious physical illness. While even the negative Holly personality longs for love, it is unable to let it flow forth, and thus often repels that which it seeks through jealously. Even when finding someone with whom to share that love, uncertainty and fears predominate and it lives in fear of losing that love. When jealousy becomes \"morbid\" the n love can be extinguished. In an extreme negative Holly state, an individual becomes suspicious, is super sensitive to real or imagined slights, feels rage and anger, experiences violent bouts of ill -humour, and, understandably, feels unloved and unworthy of love. Temporary states that can benefit from treatment with this Bach Flower Remedy arise from understandable jealousy - such as shown in a fist born child when a second child comes into the family. Also, dogs who have been the \"only child\" can also be come jealous when displaced in their families' affections by a newborn child. Holly will help both the child and the dog overcome their jealousy and extend their own love to the newborn. When describing this Bach Flower Essence , Edward Bach said: \"Holly protects us from everything that is not Universal Love. Holly opens the heart and unites us with Divine Love.\" The soul quality of Holly is that which we all desire - the ideal human state. In its positive state, individuals are able to live in inner harmony, taking pleasure in the achievements and successes of others, freely accepting and feeling love that flows toward them, and having a sense for the and having a sense for the Divine scheme of things.

He then extremely rudely and aggressively said \" You can get through there with you sodding great big 4x4\" something in me switched and all my life in situations like this I end up saying nothing and thinking afterwards about all the things I could have said bu t didn't. This time it all came out in an instant, I was calm & controlled but articulate, firm and I felt extremely proud of myself because that is the way I've always wanted to be able to handle conflict. P10 30 09:10 NS Apart from worrying about my sist er I'm feeling calm, positive etc. Able to focus. P1 35 14:00 RS My dog has gone to the vets today to have a lump removed which will be tested for cancer. Actually thinking about it I'm shockingly calm and again the word detached comes to mind. My dog is like one of the children and I think normally in this situation I'd be very upset and worried but I'm totally taking it in my stride. P10 14 14:31 NS someone said how calm I was. Feeling calm. I had related a stressful story. I have a lot on my plate at the moment but am not feeling stressed about anything. Feeling chilled. Am not worrying about a work deadline. I have missed the deadline by two days. I always have work in before a deadline. I am never normally late. Not bothered. Feeling so chilled. Won dering whether I will even complete the work. Received an email asking me when the company might receive my work. That was unusual because I was told there was no hurry despite having missed the deadline. P3 7 18:00 NS Refreashed, calm, at ease, as have be en more since the weekend of the proving than the last couple of months; but still slightly more \"back to my usual state\" - a calmer state than what's normal for me, but still more normal than the completely -at-ease state. P11 11 09:00 AS On my way to yog a: Mindful. In the now. Not in any future/past stress, just with a calm mind that is not thinking of anything really, just being. Very refreshing and calming state. P11 20 18:45 AS I expressed my non- satisfaction with the tasks that I have had put on me in addition to my main responsibiliy, and kept insisting that I did not want it in my contract that I have responsibility for running the tasks in the office that no one else wants to do. I am happy to do my part, and thereby expect credit for it, but I do n ot want it in my contract so that if it is not done then I get blame for it. Especially when the boss is pushing it on me, in the same way she pushes her employees around if everything is not to her liking. Then, even though terrified by the thought, I voi ced that I would like to know when the time and place is for discussing my salary - and by doing so ended up with a raise. I feel like I accomplished a lot more than I had even hoped with the meeting - and that I was surprisingly calm and strict with what I wanted to get through; as if it was the way I always am. P11 33 12:00 NS My mind is calm; I leave things more in the back of my mind/ in the background than usual; instead of having many thoughts fighting to catch my attention. P11 6 16:30 AS Happy to se e my boyfriend but interaction seemed to aggravate the headache P7 5 00:30 NS Not feeling as stressed out about staying with someone else when traveling for the school weekend. Though barely having time to get my stuff together and run out the door; get a gift for my host and og by the pharmacy to buy contact lense solution, I was still not bothered/stressed by the thought of missing my train; and at the airport I was almost carefree when the security stopped my bag for the food that I had brought, which would normally have bothered me/stressed me: The scenario of having to wait for them to go through my bags would usually make me really self -conscious, and stressed; but I was just waiting in my not -bothered state. P11 28 19:00 AS detached- not paid for car parking as app not working, don't care P9 34 10:30 RS No care about what others think when I deleiver bad news P13 12 XX.XX NS I suddenly had clarity of mind and finished my homework in less than an hour after struggling with it for 5 days. P10 26 20:20 NS wanting to take a year off school and have some time for things to just flow, realising i have constantly raced with life and now i know where i am going i dont need to race so fast and coould/would allow some time to just enjoy life so when i get back to homeopathy school there will be no life at school, life at home and constant split between homeowrks and enjoyiment but they will be flowing all in one...feeling very calm about my decision, feeling rather spontanious and young and freee, i dont need r eassons be there position or negative, for and against..i just am me and my choices are all in one, i am not catching/missing any trains...i am the train and i stop and go as i please and life is fun. P14 20 20:00 NS I keep thinking that I am a bit more my own person now. I have landed within myself - more than feeling the need of resonnating off other people, or seeking to be magnetised in other's company by using them as a guide to how I should behave/be in that particular setting; in order to feel secure . I am more confident within me, but still feel like this is new to me to an extent that I need to \"practice\" how I am; want to be; is natural for me to come across. P11 31 14:30 RS feeling confident and calm around people that i used to lose it , et upset or feel uncomfortable P14 12 20:00 NS confused dream of a glass building of some sort and I feel I am having a religious experience, I turn to my left and recognise a divine being, dream is very unclear but just a feeling of being touched by a spiritual feeling P9 33 02:00 NS Content, happy. Not stressed. A bit confused about what I think/feel about a guy I am dating, but in a relaxed way - wait and see, rather than stress and obsess about it. P11 36 14:00 RS desire to listen to slow music P8 3 18:15 NS Desire to walk in the open air - walked allthe way from the school to tesco and back with a friend. P8 32 18:30 NS want to draw and doodle all day. Embellishing notes with bits that will stand out P3 2 XX:XX NS I dreamt that my grandfather had dementia and t hought he was George Harrison; I was lying on a bed by his side, and I was trying to remind him who he really was; he seemed so happy to tell me he had written all those nice songs like \"Here comes the Sun\". I felt very happy near him. (Note: in real life, he passed away last April) P5 38 07:15 NS about to go on an airplain but i am at the back in the airport, lots of metal structures ans some women working, keeping everything in order are there, with white dust on their face..i think to myself that i might not earn so much but i adore my job and i am so happy P14 14 04:00 NS Spoke to ex yesterday am before college. Good call, started nervously for both, defensive and hurting both. He crying because feeling left out. I hurt. But relaxed and able to share our news. When he shows me the mountains I know he is ok. So he did, then he was relaxed. He is Nat mur complete and spends the time pushing and pulling us all away. An emotional roller coaster. My life is calmer, but less fun. Which is sad. I miss him and am feeling like a right plonker for still loving the rat! Avoiding heart by being pragmatic. Ok so dream was about him. We are on a journey driving having sex, somehow simultaneously! An Ariel shot (he drew Ariel shots well, and skydives) of us on one road but with a fork of two roads comes in sight. Sex is satisfying for him o nly, whilst I am somewhat cheesed of at this! The road forks, he takes one way, and I take the other, I wonder where he is. I wake up. Well, there you go that just about somewhere up how it all ended so selfishly and unfinished. P4 30 XX:XX OS felt better out and walking on own P9 7 13:16 NS felt very calm and collected when my sister rang me full of woes, empathised but did not get emotional, seemed total opposite to emotion earlier - a bit removed, distant P9 16 17:00 NS Watched an accident happeni ng in the rear view mirror of the car and I was calm about it; I thanked God that I could have been involved in it as well if something hadn't made me move my car forward at that moment. It was a major accident with air bags bursting in the cars and the ro ads were closed for 3 hours. P8 6 16:15 NS speak to my supervisor and she helps me to clarify the grief issue - feel quite calm and blessed for going through this experience P9 37 17:30 NS totally creative idea in relation to seminar going to give this even ing- feel as though it was a gift from somewhere P9 33 07:44 NS Company made me very happy - stayed with them longer than I was meant to P8 13 19:30 IOS Feel very home -centred since day 15. Covered some chairs. Finished knitting a jumper. Want to bake cakes (but don't!). I've been lighting the wood burner to have homely feel (even though weather quite warm). P1 19 09:00 RS Have been very laid back with Daughter, feel very laid back at home, almost as if I can't be bothered but in a nonchalant, friendly way. P4 2 08:15 NS We were at my partner's parents, and I hardly felt stressed or anxious, whereas I usually do and feel like I want to run away P5 21 09:00 NS once again staying up late at some point it was like a cloud got lifted from my head, like some broke n connection was repaired P7 13 02:00 NS Woke up feeling more rested but still as if in a haze. Did only the absolutely necessary and spend most of the time looking outside the window with an empty head; went for a walk outside, the green helped but it was as if I could not pull my mind together; this is not unusual but usually i put a lot of effort in trying to focus and do whatever it is i have to do and even beat myself up about it but this time there was nothing of the sort; i just surrendered to the se nsation, it wasn't an unpleasant sensation just not a productive one; there is a sense that there are things happening on another level that need me to sort of stand still to allow them to take place and not follow usual patterns P7 9 09:00 NS Relaxed (even knots in upper back and back of my neck that have been there for the past couple of months and definitely there before we started the process), mind relaxed (as opposed to hyper but not focused) empty, clear not alert but not in a zombie stat e. Tired. Heavy feeling from top of head coming down, eyelids heavy. Desire to sleep, keep to myself. Went on for the rest of the evening but a bit lighter. P7 1 00:10 NS I was in an unknown palce, and suddenly found myself talking to someone who was a fri end of my parents, I haven't seen him for a very long time in real life. We were talking merrily, and I said things that really cheered him up; I felt very glad and relieved for him (in real life, he suffers from alcoholism and depression) P5 5 07:45 NS Still more acting, less thinking, going with the flow, make things easier for me not perfect. In a couple of hours got a pair of shoes I needed, an outfit for my partner's birthday party tonight and some accessories (usually shopping is an ordeal for me, i t ake forever to decide as nothing fits exactly with what i have in my head and i end up exhausted and frustrated; none of the things were exactly right but it was fast, easy and i felt very content as they were more than good enough) Did not get any time to rest but somehow it did not end up ruining my evening at the party. P7 37 XX:XX NS 2- I was on the beach with children my own and others, I kept walking into the sea as the sand was spongy and soft on my feet no stones, and I marveled at how nice it was, it pleased me to be so easy on the feet, I wondered why the children were not coming in too but didn't feel moved to invite them. I held a small baby, premature size, and it had trouble with the water as I went in deeper as it reached my chest the baby took the water in and couldn't deal with it, but I made no attempt to help it or move it out of the way. I just looked on with out feeling any need to cause change. P2 1 02:52 NS I am driving along day after our group share on the proving. I am back in my lif e after a 3 days away in the school studying, and I am feeling the contrast of how I feel and how my life fits, I have a day dream of how I am as the visual 'there is a structure frame that is holding me in a place that does not bend or be swayed but stays true to my desires. Within this frame i have an image of everyting settling down, like sand through water. The frame gives me the stability for the 'emotional' stuff inside to settle, and as lay settle the feelings can be experienced and felt. Its a lovel y warm feeling i have, maybe because the feeling good and of being present with my loved ones. P2 31 04:48 NS Have been thinking that I would like to go for a run and that I could manage it! P1 35 14:00 RS Felt very joyful, had the impression that my room mate was walking around our bedroom like a fictional creature, such as an elf or an imp; really felt like laughing; the feeling then faded away P5 30 21:30 NS The dream came in two parts: 1) I was on a toilet seat, wiping myself although there was nothing to wipe; I was totally spaced out, blissful, floating; one of my aunts came and told me I had used too much toilet paper (she said she was observing me from a camera); she talked to me as if talking to a child, I told her I had been smoking a lot of cannab is, but didn't feel guilty, I felt totally laid back. 2) I came into a flat (which was mine) with a big bag of weed and was trying to hide it somewhere, but it kept falling all over the floor and I was trying to put it back in the bag, when someone came an d asked me what on Earth I was doing; I didn't feel guilty at all, just totally laid back, not a care in the wolld. (Note: I know what dried cannabis leaves feel like in real life, but in the dream, they were long ears, like wheat). P5 10 08:05 NS My partn er and I were running around, looking for something (I don't know what), at one point I went down a big long slide, I was lying down on my back. The whole dream was accompanied by a song I had been listening to earlier in the day; it seemed a bit like in a film; I felt spaced out and didn't really know what was going on P5 3 01:30 NS A beautiful friend of mine who is very lovely held my hands and said dance, she was very smiley and light, I did and felt the light happiness it was very nice, and free. I was daring to be. P2 9 13:12 NS Althoug its been a big full day and I have not got any work done, the house is feeling nice I have been present with the children all day cleaned and cooked dinner cakes and am not feeling stressed. P2 38 04:48 NS During meditation I get the imagine of golden threads connecting us all and going up the the ceiling in a large cone. P13 1 XX:XX NS Settled at home, daughter gd day at school, myself settled now, early night after fish pie and apples from parents orchard. Happy at home. P4 25 08:30 NS My father and I went to my partner's parents, and I felt very happy, not stressed at all, even the fact that my partner doesn't talk to his father didn't bother me P5 42 18:00 NS We went to get our cat from the cattery, and I felt e ver so happy; a warm wave went all over my body, and I had a vibration in the pit of my stomach; the bond was found again, the rope relaxed P5 22 17:00 NS When disclosing the proving experience/symptoms, I got a really hot sensation from my neck and up to the top of my head; a warm hotness, not boiling, just very hot - but without any perspiration. Usually get an emotional response of feeling awkward and insecure when speaking out in group -settings like that, but I actually felt quite calm and at ease in th is instence; so it is as if what is usually an emotional response to awkwardness/anxiety/insecurety was instead espressed at the physical level. P11 31 16:30 AS noticed a spot on my side then I saw it was actually an insect. Indifferent. I really wasn't bo thered about it. Perhaps curious. I was aware that I would usually be fearful of the insect but I was observing myself in a detached sort of way. I went back to sleep. (I sometimes have hallucinations about spiders on the ceiling and have to wake my husban d to get rid of them but this was new) P3 8 03:00 NS Insights about myself: had a strong sense that at times I am playing a role, like I am stuck in who I think I am and act accordingly. And indeed I may very well have been that person but somehow I got the idea that I might not be that person anymore. The s ensation was as if a light was switched on, a connection repaired and things became clearer. Not unusual especially in my psychotherapy sessions but the sensation was more intense; usually it comes in bits and pieces but this was like my perception was sharper, wider, the realisation came all at once and there was no prior intellectual processing. P7 3 12:00 NS Insights continue during our conversation yet difficulty in concentrating/focusing on other mental work. They have to do with who i am and how i rel ate to the people around me, how much space i have and how much i need, how much i allow them to occupy. [Feeling of having been playing a role continues, playing a role in the family, supporting emotionally, holding the family together (with all the tensi ons from current events everyone is tensed and exhausted and often not very understanding of the others' condition, i am there in that sense for everyone), it is really exhausting and there is no room for my sadness, my anger, my fear, my frustration, my e xhaustion. Even in my relationships with friends and partners i tend to shape around them; the focus is so much on the relationship that i respond to what i feel they need regardless of what i need as apparently the relationship is what i need.] Again, th e sensation of lights switching on in my mind and connections being repaired is quite strong or curtains being lifted (within me as opposed to the curtain between me and others). It was not the first time i was considering those things but before it was li ke \"oh, so this is what i am doing, this is who i am\" now it was \"this is what i am doing, but is this who i am? is this who i want to be?\" P7 3 XX:XX NS Laid back P8 22 12:10 NS Some parts of my dream I can still remember: I was close to a lake with a lot of fish in it; I remember being very excited about seeing so much fish breaking the water -surface, and really wanting to og fishing. But I don't think the people I were with saw them. Then I went out on the floating -thingies where there are boats; this one was really high above the water, with ladders going down into the water, and the material was weird; white, kind of soft to walk on, plastic- ish; not the usual wooden. And when I apporached where the ladder was to have a swim, my uncle (who didn't really look like my uncle in real life, but it was my uncle) was swimming with my aunt, and they were approaching the ladder to get out of the water. He was disabled from having an acci dent at the same place as he was now enjoying himself; his legs, I think - he couldn't use them, and I remember I felt sad nostalgia for him and wondered how he would get up the ladder. When they were up there were more of us there; my brother, and I don't remember who else; I asked my uncle if it was difficult to be there, in the same place where he had been in the accident, but I don't remember his reply. I didn't feel any strong emotions, just a kind of polite curiosity with the slight sadness. I wallked back towards \"land\" where also the lake was, and was talking to my brother, who \"suddelny\" (I don't think I had been aware) was talking all about his ailments; he had a list of many of his ailments, apart from being stiff and struggling to walk at a norma l pace (so he apologetically, and sadly, couldn't join me for fishing); and I felt sad for him - and frustrated because I thought \"I can help with homeopathy!!\", but he didn't seem like I could appoach him with it. On his list was stuff like Crohn's disease, and there was other bowel -diseases, and I thought about sharing my own positive experiences with changing my diet. *** I don't remember much more, apart from at that point I was walking off somewhere on my own, with a mixture of calmness in a slight agi tated atmosphere; as if the atmaosphere around me was high -wired in the build- up to something happening; and I felt apprehension, and nostalgia for my brother. The mood/atmosphere, and maybe some of the images of the dream, seemed familiar to me, though no t the \"events\". P11 9 06:00 OS Have been very light -hearted, easy -going, without letting stress get to me - even today on the day of my travels back to the country/city I live in, which usually drains me quite a bit. Happy, smiling to people spontaneously for no reason, and people seem to respond in the same way to me. My travels usually drain me, and I get worn down by the stress. P11 4 06:30 AS Lighter body and breath when walking up the hills to where I have my run; less breathless, and a lighter sensation in my body than usual, when running - felt like it was easier to push myself, and that I had more energy. P11 5 16:30 AS I'm in love with the kittens. Feeling very tender towards them - their vulnerability, dependency etc. Plus they are beautiful and funny. P1 27 07:20 RS it is very loving and different, we constantly want each other...continues for a week P14 18 20:00 NS the mountains are making me so calm, so beautful...like giving me a cuddle P14 46 XX:XX NS My central body feels different, my walk and tummy area, something that has been affected by the osteopathy, the work on my back and shoulder is really changing how my whole body works. It feel more at ease, I am using my body in a more sponteinious way, rather than having to think before i move. P2 21 04:48 RS Brother bought a house unexpectedly - felt shocked that he didn't tell us about his plan but less angered with my brother and Mother - shed a tear or 2 and slept - Calmer than I would normally be in the situation P8 32 23:00 NS I have just had my morning coffee, and realised my arm is able to move in a free full circle, I can hold it up straight and it touches the side of my face, something I haven't been able to do. I feels free and able, with some tenderness in the muscles around the shoul der but movement is not restricted. I feel great and excited. P2 20 12:57 RS I heard \"there's 160 remedies\" in my head, then woke up; again, no particular emotions, atmospheres or sensations P5 2 03:50 NS As I turned around I was with a firend of mine who incidentally has the same name with my cousin and we were on a tiny wooden boat going down a river. When we got to where we were going i asked her \"what about the boat we can't just leave it here\" and she said don't worry we will just leave it at the bar a nd as she picked it up i noticed the wood was quite worn out. Apparently I had been before to this place i was taking her and we entered a kind of a street market. At some point she realised she was missing her bag and went to find her, i told her she was going the wrong way and showed her the way we had just come from, decided to follow her to make sure she doesn't get lost. We found notes and books from her bag and the bag itself a bit further, picked everyhting up and continued on our way. We found o urselves on a beach, i pointed out that it would be nice ot have a swim but we agreed that there were too many people and the water didn't seem really clear and moved on. As we were coming back we saw these huge creatures like giant igouanas swimming real ly close to shore and as they were opening their mouths they were swallowing people (not chasing them, just as they were doing their thing). As i looked at one more closely i saw his head was opening and closing sideways instead of up and down and had two \"tops\" (eyes, nose, upper jaw; instead of lower jaw there was another top jaw nose and set of eyes). Then as i walked in a building i saw a couple of them stuffed each in one room where they could barely move (they were huge so no room for them to move), covered in a white powder. There were no emotions in either of the dreams. P7 30 XX:XX NS No pain in left knee at all walking normally, can kneel down with pressure on knee also. P4 22 XX:XX NS I am feeling very relaxed and sleepy, like I just want to let go of everything, I have no worries at all. P2 12 07:40 RS I didn't know all the lyrics for the Christmas concert I was doing with the Exeter choir the next day, but I didn't mind at all, no worries whatsoever, I didn't even bother to look some up on the Internet P5 50 20:30 NS Daughter walks in with a posse of friends, probably for support (don't blame her!) whilst they upstairs, she and I talk about what happened. Realise disorganised. I still don't accept my responsibility wholeheartedly, cannot accept that the calm bellied a storm! We hugged, and so did the girls hug me which was great and sweet. I didn't realise till now but I needed that. P4 6 16:40 AS Not feeling so worried by the lump, as I have forgot it mostly and got on with things as it doesen't hurt. I have a general concern, but trusting it is part of the proving, maybe a good thing to get expressed. I am thinking of going to show a doctor for another opinion. P2 12 03:21 RS driving home. Traffic jam. Not bothered. Usually avoid traffic and fee l flustered, anxious. Instead, I am looking at the jam and feeling relaxed. It is time to spend on my own. P3 3 18:00 NS at my parent's house. My brother facetimed to wish my mum a happy birthday. My mum wouldn't let me stand next to her to say hi to my br other. She told me to 'p --- off'. I wasn't upset. Not bothered. My dad came down the stairs and told me that I looked pregnant and started laughing at me. I was indifferent. Normally I would have been offended. P3 6 11:30 NS I didn't feel nervous at all wh ile singing on the stage, even if I missed some words; usually, I'm worried in anticipation P5 51 14:00 NS time not registering when I look at clock, think it means midnight at 00.59 P9 35 00:59 RS Loquacious with partner.

P14 3 10:00 NS I am on a high up coastal road, its small and single track with a cottage. I love it its just seems to be my ideal place to live, I say to myself this is the place, it has pathways going down off to the sea. There is a family living in it, I think that's a shame how can i get them out, but only in a humorous way. I go to one room at the end and see its open and they have a sort of makeshift bar for holiday makers Its all a bit old and out of date, but warm and friendly and i stay for a while. I feel very happy and at peace. P2 15 10:48 NS Suddenly Feeling really peaceful after the meditation, a few animals, black and red, symetr ical and it opens up, like a flower but its not.

I move without a thought as if i was young and fit. P2 30 09:36 RS I dreamt that I was pregnant, but instead of giving birth to a baby, I gave birth to two toy calves (like you find in Play Mobile); I was absolutely stunned, but at the same time, very joyful and light in my body, as if I was a helium balloon; I asked my partner why he thought I had calves and no baby, and he said: \"Because our relation is a bit hip- lally\". I laughed and asked him what he meant and he said \"strange\". (Note: don't even know whether it's an English word or whether I invented it in my dream). P5 18 05:45 NS In spite of all the difficulties at work, I managed to have a lovely evening out with my partner. Usual ly all the work related things sort of take over our entire lives but this time I managed to remain at the present and enjoy my night out, I realised how important it is for me to be able to do this in spite of everything, for me personally as well as for my relationship. P7 44 XX:XX NS Delighted to see my sister (who has broken her leg. I've come down to help out for a few days). Feeling patient with her loquaciousness. Very happy to be here. Chilled. Relaxed.

Usually I can not bear it for a whole day: enjoy it for a while, but then need to 'escape' out into the fresh air - be around/see people, even if I don't talk to anyone. But today I was completely fine with just being in my own company; didn't feel any overwhelming lone liness or restlessness (just slightly, but not so much), and thought that it was fine to postpone the lovely feeling of fresh air and moving my body to tomorrow. (I was tired from a fun evening/night before, but usually even then I need to get out of the f lat!) I allowed myself to rest, and it felt good. P11 13 20:00 AS 1 - I was in an old part of a town, with a row of little units that had old sellers, crafts, unusual stuff, portabella road market style. All the venders were clearing out, I watched in a pa ssive mode, I knew it was sad and upsetting for the people but wasn't emotional. There were going to be new large shinny glass steel building to replace these ones. P2 1 XX:XX NS I do feel like I am more present in my own body/whole being, and that I am mo re comfortable in my own skin. It is the same calmness and at -ease- ness that I have been experiencing, as well as feeling more stable in a way - less moved by who I am with and where I am - less changeable - which makes me feel more secure within myself. P11 29 14:15 AS time went slowly again whilst cycling home P9 20 23:30 RS I dreamt that my partner and I had gone into a world of tiny people; we were tiny too, my whole body felt warm and comfortable, I could run everywhere; I felt in a very joyful and pl ayful mood; I woke up being very close to my partner P5 13 22:30 NS tranquilised and sedated P8 21 11:00 NS My Yoga teacher said it felt as if I was unmovable, she was wondering 'how am I going to get her to move' I felt very happy and peaceful. Unemotional rather than unmovable. Detached P2 5 00:00 NS I see the RSPCA come but they are dressed like riot police I am not worried I know there is not evidence and feel completely calm about it. I have triumphed over evil and that was more important so I was cool about everything. P9 29 XX:XX NS then an old school friend of my sisters turned up and he started to build something to entertain the children on the wall, it was like an interconnecting apparatus that would mean a ball or water could drop down through it. It was very good and my grandaughter thought it was very funny so I thought he could be trusted to babysit P9 5 XX:XX NS then there was half time in the service and my sister took me to one of the handyman's rooms and all the tools were gone, s he wanted to show me an idea for a quiz called 'tree of life' and each question you got correct, you got given a leaf to stick on the tree. the overall feeling of this dream was happy that everything had worked out for everyone P9 9 XX:XX NS When I looked down from the landing it was as though the room was floating and the space all around had been cleared and I looked down and there was a military camp in khaki and an airstrip P9 22 XX:XX NS when I was half way down the street I realised I was on my own an d went back for him as I wanted him to come with me, general feeling happy and contented P9 NS on a train journey with a four wheeled upright suitcase, it is running very smoothly over the ground and I am very happy with it P9 3 05:00 NS No one helps me and I have a lot of things to gather up - I am disorganised and try to carry everything in my arms without folding them or putting them in bags. There is a table lamp, flex, clothes and I am trailing them all but I'm not worried . I know I'm still ok to cat ch the train. I go down the drive and all the old people are watching me but I think they do not care less as they do not offer to help. Still not worried though. P9 35 XX:XX NS I was in America, with a member of my staff, to visit a colleague who is the h andyman at work. He and his wife had moved there to start a business, caf\u00e9 or restaurant, it was a very run down place that needed a lot of work. He was very happy as he would be very busy and was telling me he quit work and would not be back P9 9 02:16 NS I dreamt I was in a very high room probably about 9 meters and on all walls there were bookcases up to the ceilings, I was in awe of all the beautiful books, the height of the room and the bookcases looked so solid and high and I decided this is where I w ant to stay P10 2 07:25 NS I wished them well and got in the car to drive to Kennedy Airport, I was using the sat nav and it was dark, but I was pleased the handyman had left and was happy as it gave me some opportunities back at work too. P9 9 XX:XX NS My Mum sat on the table and I asked her to look after the youngest grandaughter as the adults were just sitting around talking, my Auntie then said I've come to go again you can say good bye to me and I went out of the door and there was a long corridor like in a hotel and I waved her goodbye, she seemed happy, she walked away smiling and waving. P9 9 XX:XX NS I feel like I am warmer than I usually am; ususally I am chilly and prone to temperature changes, or changes in my activity- level (being stil:cold, m oving:warm), but I seem to be more stable, and this morning even quite warm - even without breaking a sweat. P11 16 06:00 AS I wanted to give my Dad Aur, because he has had it before and I think he would do good on another one - though my family knows noth ing about/haven't been too open to homeopathy. I approached him about it, and he was open for taking another dose - I don't know if it was to please me or because he genuinly wanted to take it, but I was happy all the same. *** I was talking to my family ( ?) and there was suddenly a puppy there - looking like the puppies our dog had many years back, but not quite; and then I saw that there was a labrador mother (?) and many puppies. I was excited and wanted to play with them, and cuddle with them, and make sure they had everything they needed. P11 31 08:00 RS About water, or rather with water involved. A dream after a day of stress, mainly financial but fuelled dreadful melancholy and furious temper again, felt very sad and frustrated all day. Angry with mys elf for being disgruntled and angry and upsetting my daughter over this. We get on and both have a good day but it could have been better since we bickered on and off. So went to bed exhausted. My dream was of water which to me is always sign of emotion fo r me. Myself and a young woman at the beach, has taken us a while to get there but we are there loving the fresh air and freedom. We are sitting very high up on a wall, and we don't know if we can hear it first or see it. But a huge tsunami of water is com ing. It's energy is overwhelming. I say come on we Gotta go, she won't budge. I pursuade her to come with me, and run. As we come up the beach I have noticed a thin old looking man who has been watching us but secretly from behind. Not joining in but bein g there, he is familiar. But he's fallen asleep. He hadn't bothered us but I wanted to help him. He wouldn't wake up. So I picked him up and slung him over my shoulders like a sack of potatoes. We ran, as fast as we could. We always had the threat of the w ater behind us but I weaved us through the back streets that were familiar but seemed to be taking us back in time but always uphill, and always sort of behind the scenes. We came across a fun fair, which was deserted, but then realised it was because we w ere inside the structures. There was water but only rainwater that had collected. The water from the tsunami was nearer, deafening. We jumped clambered, ran climbed and all the time through familiar yet back stage. We got to an circle of escalators and ran backwards up them when the doors opened at the top we had reached the end. The tsunami had hit and we could see people running, there was a small white dog and I was reaching for it trying to rescue it, but I just couldn't reach it. The people ran over it , there was blood, it didn't look real. I was more sad for the dog than any of the people. We had passed so many who hadn't listened to the warnings. After a time of exhaustion from the panic escape, we starting going back to see what had happened. People were back at the funfair but we're looking at us weirdly, where had we come from. Telling us we weren't allowed to join in the fun, we didn't want to we were just passing. When we got back to the beach, we found people had chained and locked themselves to railings, and we're still there living normal lives but chained down. There was music playing. We were sitting at a beach bar. I wanted to dance, so started to tap my feet, by this time I was chained too, and limited in my ability. I seemed to be content to be semi dancing, but knew I could really dance. Then this fella came over he was unchained!! And started to rock n roll with a short skirt on in front of me, he wanted to dance and took my hand. I stepped of the beach bar stool to dance, bit nervous but collapsed to the ground. My body danced and my feet but my legs just didn't work anymore. I was exhausted. After all the panic, escape, rescuing going back in time and finally finding some kind of normal I couldn't go on and was in a state of collapse. Woken up feeling well rested, calm, very busy with 2 part dreams however. P4 2 07:40 NS don't want to go to work. Can't be bothered, don't care.

P4 28 XX:XX NS Forceful, sure, brave and strong Feeling stronger and not restricting myself, sure within myself, and also standing up for myself, indifference .

Essence about time passing very fast. Of me Rushing about. On my favourite beach, running at high speed, flying across ground virtually, li ke I have an engine in me.

Also dream of taking out a male urine Catheter, which is connected to this almighty water pipe, I go through the whole speech pre procedure and take it out!! This follows by seeing a friend also on the be ach but dressed in a trouser suit, realising he doesn't want to be doing shirt stuffy work but hang in the water and at the beach, so he does. I last see him kneeling in the water allowing it to rise up over his head, and recede back down with the tide, an d then again up and over and down.

When I was struggling to get away, the two guys bumped into each other - and they were both in flames, and came after me. Even though I made an effort to get away from the m, it was not in a panicking way, but more of a sensible intention of escaping the flames. P11 30 07:30 NS Desiring recognition for the things I have done - wanted my name on the FB photo that I had taken P8 28 15:00 NS Desiring spontaneonity and don't wan t to commit to arrangements - don't want to book anything P8 30 07:00 NS desire to open doors and windows P8 29 08:10 OS Maura is reuniting with someone from her past. This is a surprise organised by Q. She seems amazed and delighted but her and the friend don't embrace. They stand apart until C, my brother, comes and brings them both together into an emotional hug with him. P1 12 04:00 RS Have a general excited buzz about my body P2 1 XX:XX NS felt brave and caught the wasp in a glass and let it out of the room - generally I look for shoes to kill P8 32 07:45 NS Intolerant to any contradiction; what I say is right and please don't argue about it - forceful P8 53 19:30 NS Not restricting myself - feeling free from the restrictions - doing what I want to do P8 32 20:05 NS Still feeling attractive!

P1 13 11:30 RS Stubborn feeling - wanted to camp despite storm and felt better for being outside despite howling noises from wind in the trees. Lay in wind blown tent really happy. P9 29 21:00 NS Thinking of the film 'All is Lost' as I wake up. Thing s looming out of the fog - a liner, a tiny boat, boat being hit, sinking. Huge immovable force, looming above me. Helpless in the face of it. I'm nothing. It doesn't even see me. A tiny speck, molecule, nothing. P1 18 07:15 RS I had to force myself out of bed, I feel very ill, P10 22 10:30 NS I feel almost at ease enough to speak my mind in class; share my thoughts/opinions out loud, which I never do. Whether I think it's a good thought or an okay question, no matter - I never voice stuff out loud (apart from very rare occasions). Today I felt like I was almost at ease enough to do just that - share my thoughts on the case analysis out loud. Not quite confident enough, but almost; which was in a way a bit frustrating. Less timid; but not quite brave enough. P11 29 14:00 AS Out of frustration and a nagging feeling that have been with me all weekend since my boss cornered me, I sent a txt to my boss and the controller in the firm asking to have a meeting with them - referring to the talk that my boss had with me on the previous Wednesday. I sent the text the moment my plane landed in Oslo, to make sure that I would not wimper out on it. A bit nervous about it, but a lot less than I would have imagined. P11 32 14:00 NS River Avon in Bath is flowing backwards. I'm with old friend and she watches as I show her my new exciting game and get her to join in - flinging myself into the river and being swept down to the weir.

I have evidentl y just missed it (not a large jam before it). I am very calm. I would normally be panicky. I wasn't. This is more time to be alone. I am detached from the situation. I would normally worry for the people involved which would make me feel panicky but I am n ot bothered about the people or the situation. I am not feeling their pain or acting out the accident in my mind as I normally do. P3 3 18:40 NS Of laughing a lot with Stuart Maconie (the 6 Music radio DJ) P1 4 03:25 OS Busy energy all day.

It didn't even occur to me that I had; before after the lecture went on, and then I was a bit amazed - almost taken aback. And, a fellow stuent in the group was the next person to speak out - we are the two most quiet ones in the group when it comes to participating verbally in the lectures.

Danger because there are massive cliff -like waves with sheer sides suddenly appearing in the sea and the liner will fall off the cliff of the wave. Very exciting beca use I'm surfing the same waves. I have to be daring and hold my nerve. I'm with P and we are encouraging each other. Exhilerating and scary. Huge ocean.

My own youngest child is having to re -learn to walk after breaking her leg age 2.

P2 11 XX:XX ns I arrive home, and am extreamly rightous with my Ex partner who has been in my house looking after the children all weekend. I a m angry he has to be in my house, and try to explain how his uncooparitiveness towards me is not exceptable when dealing with the children, he tries to tell me whats wrong with me, i wont get into a fight and make him leave. (while away he would not speak with me about the children or disscuss things, i felt scared and out of control of the children and worried he would do someting dangerous and risk thier safety) P2 30 00:00 RS My aunt had a laparoscopic surgery yesterday and my mum who was out of town with my father called and asked us to visit in the hospital (sometimes it is like we are kind of an extension of herself and she naturally assumes that we will do things on her behalf and share her views of what it means to be there for everyone in need, whic h used to infuriate me and i would either do it while boiling with anger or react and not do it even if it was something i would like to do for myself, which naturally left me angry). It was 20.00 and i was still at the office exhausted from a very intense day with an hour's drive to get home; gave my aunt a call to check up on her and see if she needed anything, all was well so i went home. When my mum called and was clearly disappointed, i very calmly explained to her that my aunt was well taken care of a nd indeed it would have been nice to go and just keep her some company for a while but my need to take care of me was greater than that. She was free to exhaust herself while taking care of others but that was not my way of doing things and would set my own terms in my relationships with family and friends. It was not the first time we had this conversation but it was always intense and emotional with me feeling frustrated and misunderstood and my mum disappointed, this time it was different, i did not feel detached but was very composed, centered, no anger or guilt. There were no labels, no uncaring, insensitive person or disappointing daughter, it was just me being me (very much like not \"good\" or \"bad\" people, just people in Day 3).

No panic or grief. Feeling normal.Able to cope. Not overwhelmed. Feeling continues all day and evening. P1 32 12:00 RS Feeling steady, hopeful, not stressed. P1 33 08:00 RS Before the weekend my boss \"cornered me\" and told me that she would li ke me to take on some of the tasks that she doesn't know who else to give to: preparing lunch, and making sure the cafeteria -area looks clean and nice. I tried to express that I prefer to stick to my main tasks of accounting, but she was not very easy to speak to - she likes to have her way and quickly retaliates if she experiences resistance. So, I sat down to look at my contract this morning: with suggestions to changes, and with my terms for staying in the position at the firm. I feel like I should get p aid more for doing the stuff nobody else wants to do, and also be clear that although I want to be flexible - I will not succumb to all my boss' \"demands\" just because I am timid and don't dare to speak against her. This is slightly out the normal -zone for me; I might be tough/brave enogh to ask to maybe discuss it a bit further, but picking my contract to pieces with the aim of having a meeting where I \"voice my terms - and maybe even go as far as saying okay, then I'm not right for this firm and vice vers a\", is pretty drastic for me; I might have thought about it - and maybe even looked at the contract - but actually being in a mindset to carry this through is new and exciting, and I feel like I am in a justified and strong position to do so. P11 28 12:00 AS trowing things to my partner P14 44 XX:XX NS I dreamt that my partner and I were travelling by plane, but that we weren't supposed to do so, having no passports. Still, we managed to get through the customs and meet my father, my aunt and my uncle; I knew the police was searching foh us, but I didn't feel worried at all, everything was easy, flowing, I was in a perfect mood P5 53 04:45 NS Colleague from work in a house like Hawkwood, I was trying to get something organised P6 23 02:00 RS trying to speak my mind - being able to represent myself P8 25 10:30 NS I met his wife but realised he was lying to me as I knew his wife was Japanese and this lady was not, when I spoke to my staff member about it she said she knew and I did not believe her, thought she was lying too. P9 9 XX:XX NS I sawed off my hands and wrists, and a couple of fingers (index fingers?) - and there were more people doing it too(?). Uncomfortable - but in a fascinating way. We had to be careful putting them together again; let them get at tached so that they could grow back together properly - and carefully fold the skin back in place so that it wouldn't loosen from everything underneath. Eventually I asked my grandfather for advice (he was an acknowledged plastic surgeon) - he thought that everything looked good, that I had done a good job with it. *** It was my brother's birthday; I gave him a table that I had gotten from my mum and dad and wanted to get rid of, and some baskets/basket -making -kit, that I know would have suited his girlfrie nd a lot better. (My brother and his girlfriend broke up two days ago - after 6 years together.) This took place in our family's house, where my Mum had rearranged the kitchen somewhat so that there was so much room - it was wonderful! The huge \"corner fri dge\" taking up so much space with all the food that just rots in there uneaten (a source of frustration to me) was removed, and my Mum said she doesn't eat that much anyway. *** From years back; secondary school?; hanging out with one friendly girl, and on e very stuck up and shallow one who only ignored me - just like it felt like a lot of the time in secondary school. My principal at the current school and I were sneaky and jumped ahead in the lunch queue, after I had walked a while right behind two study -friends from university. P11 27 06:50 NS I helped out even though I was on a day off, but that evening there was still smoking and disrespect going on in all areas and I asked to see the manager, she walked past me and said I had to make an appointment but I did not know how. P9 16 XX:XX NS made a gianduja tart for my boyfriend's godmother (excellent cook and hostess). Usually I am very particular about following instructions to the letter, and if things don't turn out the way they should I get frustrated d isappointed and many times i don't even present whatever i have made but this time i just went along with my boyfriend (who is exactly the opposite: just get it done) It didn't feel natural to me but wasn't as hard either to get over all the things that were not as they should have been (not even close!) and to just take the tart and go and enjoy our visit. P7 16 XX:XX NS I wrote a written complaint to my boss - as a response to what I experience as unprofessional and unpleasent leadership -skills and treatm ent of employees. Basically, I critisised her leadership -style; especially the way decisions are made and how employees are adressed/spoken to; and at the same time wtihdrawing my confirmation about coming to the Christmas party. And, I withdrew from the l unch arrangement at my work place, which is part of the way she prefers to \"dictate\". I was quite upset with the way I was treated by her yesterday, and also happy with the way I am handling it - and responding to it rather than hiding away from it; though it is unpleasant. P11 41 08:00 RS we went down some dark wet corridors to a room and I asked him to tell me clearly what the issue was, it seemed we had had a client who had taken the work camera away and was holding it to ransom for some reason but I st ill could not understand why. And told him so, he stormed off. P9 5 XX:XX NS there was a big steel barge and we were painting it and tricking someone into the way we wanted it done against the design or will - very vague P9 22 03:00 NS I was working in a ne w job as an assistant manager and it was a restaurant which seemed to be in a huge concrete type warehouse building. I did not feel welcome as I was disapproving of the hygiene standards and the fact that the customers were smoking and there did not seem a ny concern for me as a new member of staff. My live -in rooms were just a section of the warehouse screened off at the end and I asked that at least the area outside my room was non -smoking so that I did not have to breathe it in whilst I was off duty P9 16 05:30 NS some children were being naughty and I was trying to work and live in a tiny room - so tiny my sofa was on the landing where the children passed. I was giving lectures P9 22 05:00 NS he had not noticed, but an old colleague of mine was there who h ad done child psychology and she started analysing me. I went up to him and said I may call you S occasionally but do not worry about it. I suggested we went home as I was a distance from home and needed to get a train and we needed our bikes out of the sh ed. I got mine and rode off P9 6 XX:XX NS I then decided to get my nail file back and retrieved it from the girl like it was a small victory. Somehow in the middle of the shop there was a car, an old banger, which I got into and drove out of the shop. The shop had nothing to sell and was very dark. P9 8 XX:XX NS we carried it from the office down to the car on the way we came across a 'free Wednesday ' sale where there was a big hall with lots of items being given away. There were shirts and rugby world cup socks and I suggested my daughter could get things for Christmas presents, she turned her nose up and said her partner would not wear them, but she would look for anything that may be useful for their wedding P9 8 XX:XX NS when I got back to work ther e was a church service going on and everyone was complaining that they had not been able to get in the previous day and I knew this was because the handyman had left but I did not tell them what I knew as I was going to offer them some extra rooms and char ge them more as they had been asking for this. P9 9 XX:XX NS Because we apparently were close to the water, I rolled out into the water where there were floating sharks just under the surface. I was almost a bit apprehensive, but because I was really sure that they were dead I was not scared. When I swam/waded towards the shore there were so many dead fishes everywhere - floating upside down in the surface. I was disturbed by it: worried, concerned, and though they were a bit discusting so I tried to avoid touching them too much, but also concerned that them rotting might produce disease. On my way back again, by land, I tried to get some photos on my phone of all the dead fishes - I don't know if it was to show someone out of concern, or if it was to reveal whatever was going on seemingly unnoticed. Awoke from a dream. Looking after a couple in an outdoors nursing home, but they are middle aged, they are living apart in place. It is a park or a woods, with seats and areas of their choice but outside. The y are both intellectuals, but he's worse than she in so far as isolating himself, she. Sociable but hurt somehow, she smokes, watches everyone but doesn't mix much. Then flips to an inside place as if from a previous time, much younger, young adults 20 som ethings. Place is a mess, all out doing something fab, it's a student type place, one bloke there telling us of how they came to get him. About extraterrestrials or something evil, not sure, but lad is saying get ready they coming for you all. He shows me there footprints, he knows he's about to go, or be taken. I'm back with these older people, and tell them of something coming and there are ways to help ourselves and save ourselves. The young lad showed me what I needed. I brought back supplies of stuff, and showed masses of people what to do. Managed to convince everyone who got on with getting ready for whatever these things were. I got the older man ready who was still insisting on being apart and ruffed and selfish I thought to not help his slightly in firm and crippled wife, as it happened. I felt burdened but got on with it. She didn't seem bothered but I got her ready. Then was seemingly taking so long for myself, I didn't notice everyone just filing out of now an enclosed outside!!to like an airport corridor, where I could see mysterious tall dark figures with flowing gowns coming towards the outside building! I was saying why are you all just going towards them? Why aren't you using your tools and things I'd been given to stop them take you away. I w as shocked, upset and this sent me into realising I wasn't ready and I couldn't organise myself in time either. The old woman looked at me and got up and walked out!! Despite being in a panic and upset I knew I'd try and use the things given to me, if only....I woke up!! Went to Glastonbury yesterday too,just occurred to me may have picked up some strange energies from there for sure! P4 14 07:12 NS guys who were very smart and doing front office development left the company, I somehow managed to get that role, then they come back in a month or so and were very surprised that I was doing that.

Don't want to be here. I don't want to be in the company of anyone. I am finding people's energy too close to me. I need a bigger personal space around me. People are encroaching into my space.

P10 7 08:00 NS I have suddenly realised listening to the others in the class talking about sexual themes I have suddenly realised that I have had no interest in sex this month.

I have to wait to be invited. That's how it works. It's the law (like the liner, the law doesn't make exceptions for individuals, it ploughs through). I know this in my heart. Observing them. Outside looking in. They're all having a great time together. I'm excluded. A very young, child -like feeling - about 5 -9 years old.

Feel free, excited, reaching my potential when flying - and adventurous with the camping gear with me on my back. But when I can't fly the frustration and irritation brings me into a gloomy mood, and when I'm suddenly at the campsite and my brother and his girlfriend is in the tent with me, but still far awa y in the other part of the tent, I don't want anything to do with them and don't say anything; I keep to myself. (RS: because of the way that I have kept to myself, not able to reach out to my family - not even my brother, who I haven't really had any issues with, but who is part of the familiy and thereby some of my grievances...) P11 3 06:00 RS I dreamt that I was in a homeopathic clinic; the homeopath was telling about a case of a young woman who, when she was a teenager, threw a baby (her little sister) through the window while her mother was driving; I later realised that woman was a dear friend of mine; it was such a shock for me that I never wanted to be in the same room as her again P5 51 04:30 NS picking up the mood at work with everyone being ill a nd wishing i am somewhere fullfilling my purpose P14 24 15:00 NS It was a similar \"inside -environment\" as the dream inside the shopping centre - though it was not the same place, and the word that comes to mind is more of a hospital hallway, though: it was in a wildlife national park, with wild animals (it may be that it is similar to a dream from the pre -porving, but I am not sure). There were wildlife everywhere; my brother was there, I think, and our parents were somewhere around too but had left us to f end for ourselves at that time (no specific feelings about that, positive nor negative, we were simply on our own); There were wildlife trying to close in on me: lions, and some others I cannot remember; I tried to outsmart them but it wasn't easy, and I w as bitten in my arm and almost taken by them.

P14 13 09:00 NS A thought occured to me; that it is as if my body is catching up with all the rest that it hasn't managed to get for a long time - as if I have been una ware of not getting the rest I need because of all the mental stress. And now that my mind is quieting/stressing down; and I am managing to allow my emotional state to work through all the tough stuff in a more soothing and gentle way than before, rather t han bottle it all up; it's as if my body can finally be allowed to function - both in terms of being up for all the physical activity I enjoy, but also when it comes to relaxing/sleeping/recharging the energy storages. P11 15 23:00 NS Had a call from my su pervisor who was annoyed and felt I was relying too much on her for filling in the diary; I felt like I was told off, like a little 5 -year- old girl who's done wrong and is waiting for a punishment; I felt like crying, but couldn't; on the other hand, the a dult part of me felt it was unfair, and I wanted to defend myself; the end of the conversation, fortunately, was much warmer and I felt much lighter, like there was a resolution to a festering problem P5 19 20:45 NS I noticed at school all day and now that I really don't want to engage with the other students much, I want to keep myself to myself and I don't want to hug the way I usually do.

Then i noticed large plant and was complelled to take a acutting, i didn't ask, but just did it and felt bad afterwards or a little awkward.

And what does good and bad really mean. And those people at the office who i thought were \"good\", on our side and then went and got an injunction behind our backs to freeze the company's assets and turned \"bad\", perhaps they are not good or bad they are just people, people looking out for themselves in a way that maybe i wouldn't. But then again how sure can i be of that? What if i had children to feed? Maybe i would still not do it but maybe i would. And how am i supposed to relate to them now? It is as if i have been relating without any boundaries (with the \"good\") or not at all (with the \"bad\"). Black and white are easy but what am i supposed to with the 50,000 shades of grey?

Him and his wife ask me how I am but regretfully they have to leave as a car is waiting P9 32 XX:XX NS arriving with a car to some place and my cousin is there...she is pregnant....i look at her big tummy and touch it around and think aloud maybe i will catch it...it looks like a small city neighbourhood, with buildings but still play areas and green( never seen it before) and we go into a deserted building up the elevator to hide and smoke( her and i used to hide a lot of naughty things we did when we were young) and an ex boyfriend is there...i sa w him reently actually...there is no other feeling but that of his sexual attraction to me...he pulls me to sit on his lap, i am ok there but then i remember my partner and feel guilty about it...i shy away...we have to go...baby is coming...we have to get back in the elevator but i have so much stuff...i try to collect my things...i have my partners jacket and jumper?!! and my things...i carry it all and things keep fallowing off...we get to it at the end....contractions begin and now we are in some apartm ent...but it is a very old friend who i have not seen for over ten years and he is giving birth...i cuddle his head and tell him how amazing he and his partner are( as i saw them on facebook) and it is all very freindly and kind and then i ask him why is he giving birth but not hsi parnter and he says she had an operation and she cant have hildren, so he does it for them...and now she is on a holiday as she is a little sad she couldnt do it P14 25 04:00 NS a friend's mother had died and I was comforting h er, I did not recognise her and she was a pretty blonde girl a bit like a TV actress. The following week I went back to see her at her sisters house and a another friend of mine, a male, came in to see us too, I spoke to him bit did not really look up at h im, it wasn't until the friend said 'wow, that's amazing' that I looked up and saw he had hair (he has alopecia in real life) he was tossing his head around really pleased with his shoulder length locks. P9 6 06:40 NS was at work but in the previous low bungalow with one room, my Duty Manager came in but would not look me in the eye, but was saying lots of problems to me by his tone of voice, I tried to placate him but realised as I could not understand what he was saying I had to ask him for a translation P9 5 06:00 NS the next day I was on a day off but because I lived on site I came to see there was a lot of alterations being made the tables were all being moved and there was going to be new smoking rules, I had not realised there was a do wnstairs and this was where the Capoeira was going to be ( this is a sport that happens at my real workplace) so I thought ' this is their other work -out place, they will vouch for me with the Manager when they come as they know me. P9 16 XX:XX NS Moan to anyone and everyone about the proving. Wouldn't usually carry on like this to just anyone (save it for close friends). Also laugh and joke with the group as usual. But this felt as though I was swinging from one state to another. P1 29 11:30 NS Focus, energy and action Highly Productive, getting lots done. Vitality increased, massive creative fix- it energy, busy, achieved many things. Feeling motivated, with good brain power. Meeting deadlines, creating order. Feeling social, focused, energetic. No need to sleep, cannot sleep, or disturbed sleep. Aware of having a headache all night, occipital edge behind both ears, feels like a bolt passing through , same as in meditation. P4 2 09:50 NS Woke with astounding new energy, despite a broken sleep. Hopp ed out of bed into clothes got to work early. P4 7 06:05 NS Felt wide awake, and with a good energetic level, when getting up, even though I didn't sleep well. Normally, after such a restless night, I would have felt less refreshed and quite drained/tired. P11 32 05:30 AS see both clocks as saying 06:37 so get up and rush around P9 31 05:37 NS I am noticing when I get agitated by things and get a deisre for addicted substance, cigarette, choc or treat I am just noticing it then only a very short while and they thoughts subside. The intensity is much less. P2 34 02:24 NS Extra half day at work, teaching new staff. Volunteered for this. Because of huge energy last week, of organising and 'seeing' what's needed for staff. Great day. Better arvo cuddling dog and reading! P4 26 XX:XX NS Better concentration and more organised in doing the case work assignment P8 52 19:00 NS Heavy- short -breath -ish; as if I don't breath deep enough on the subcounsious level, so I have to make a conscious effort to breath deep e nough: With a feeling of pressure/something taking up space in my stomach region, blocking the way the breath usually expands/distends the stomach. P11 11 17:00 RS I really can't be bothered to do anything today, the focus and determination seems to have left me. I did get some work done but I did have to force myself to move. P10 21 09:30 OS I was in a pickup truck with someone who works in our company, in the branch office in Patras (not particular relationship with him good or bad) and we reached a big iron gate with a chain and padlock. I was wondering how we were going to get through but he said \"don't worry\" and just drove through breaking the chain. We were on a dirt road and big rusty storage spaces (not just in some places, the entire structures were this orangy rusty color) were on the sides. Noone was around, it was very quiet, deserted. The sun was shining and as the bright sun shine fell on the rusty surfaces i thought the contrast of the deserted, decaying (no sense of filth or ro tting or dark just of the effect the passing of time had on the metal structure, old) structures with the brightness and vividness of the sunshine as well as the orange in the rust would make very nice photos. P7 3 XX:XX NS I called my cousin from last ni ghts dream and she said she had a very bad night sleep and packed her children and left her husband called her again in few days and they were back together and all is well...P14 17 10:00 OS Concentration better; took more notes in class than usual P8 33 14:00 NS A very strong dej\u00e0 -vu, when sitting on the bed undoing some of my crocheting, while my friend is looking for a travel itinirary on her computer; especially the coulours of the walls (pink) and the lighting in the room (warm but dim) felt very fam iliar to me. P11 3 22:54 OS I was in my friends big shinny landrover, she asked me to drive I had to reverse it, I was having trouble to reach the pedals and was not incontrol, as I reversed it out of its space there was parked cars behind that I knew I w as too near too or felt I was but couldn't see clearly so was unsure. I hit something there was loud smashing sounds, expected to have caused a big gash. When i got out there was a tressle table with lots of old glass ware on , that had made the noise, the landrover was untouched. An old lady on the stall was shocked put milked the situation, for more sympathy. The night befor this dream we had picked up the landrover from a friends dad who had done some repairs on it, the vehical has had lots done to it , this uncle looks dubious, & dodgy, we meet in a pub at 9pm to exchange cash for a scrap of paper outlining his work, quite a lot of money was asked, we get into the vehical and i won't start, he has left in a flash and nowhere to be seen. The friend of t his uncle comes from a similar background to me, I recongnise my interest in the contrast between dodgy chancer style of working to clear dependable honest. The friend with the car, has been a great friend and i've conciously recognised her as honest trusw orthy and dependable to do the right thing, P2 13 00:14 NS Dosed off on the sofa in the middle of the day; I was in deep sleep - could not hear phones ringing or the door bell. I woke up fresh and the headache had gone. P8 36 14:00 NS Dream - Dog trying to escape from the open main door and I'm trying to catch him P8 5 04:35 RS Feel more energetic after 2 glasses of red wine P1 6 20:00 RS have sense since proving that the energy of the Rx is still in the room. > going outside into cool. Come inside and Sx return. Thought of the energy of Rx in the room is making me feel anxious about going into the room or being in the room (this continued to the next month and became phobic) P3 2 XX:XX NS Loads of great energy, got a lot done creatively. >>>outside o r door flung open of house. Love being outside walking briskly. P4 3 XX:XX AS It's as if the last couple of days have been \"the quiet before the storm\", with the ease/calmness I have experienced; while today I have felt alert, as if a tangible experience of hyper -stimulation of my being, not just mind but mind and body and jellowy- lump combined. Still I feel like I have good energy, and am not drained from the efforts, but my mind is more busy than the last couple of days. P11 7 20:00 AS I started to do h ousework and felt very energetic, as if I was on a stimulant; I did quite a lot whereas I usually hate doing housework and get tired very quickly P5 35 08:30 NS I felt absolutely delighted because my efforts weren't vain in applying for a grant in France, I was chosen among 20 people to get the money and pay for my studies P5 5 10:00 OS Apparently I have more energy than I thought. We slept at 7 in the morning, woke up 12, cleaned up most of the stuff from the dinner and dancing party of 55 guests, got so me rest, visited some friends, went to a charity dance, slept at 1 in the morning. P7 38 XX:XX NS Excited because my sister in law sold her house (in the dream) P6 28 02:00 RS We had to get a plan ready and start laying people off and suspending others. Even though we don't really have any other choice right now it is still very hard for me to put that nail in the coffin. It still feels wrong and unfair and all the pain and grief and tears started coming up but because we were at the of fice and really needed to get this done if we wanted to have a chance with the new partnership i focused on the task at hand and kind of suspended emotional response. P7 43 XX:XX NS We had a meeting with our new partner and he started bringing up several legal issues that would arise from our future cooperation and how it was a lot of trouble for small gain and how we needed to figure out how to minimize the risk. It did sound for a moment as if he was about to back out. Normally i would collapse as basica lly everything is hanging on this cooperation but i just observed myself being very focused on the practicalities of the matter and suggesting different ways to go about them. At the end we came up with a solution with my brother and he agreed to consider it and look for other alternatives as well. P7 49 XX:XX NS Still in the same mode. Also more independent and in charge. Somehow I ended up having to make plans for a night out and gather everyone. Usually, I have no particular opinion as far as the place is concerned and just tag along so now that I was stuck with the planning and coordinating in the begginning i was quite upset; thoughts about how i didn't know where to book and having to contact and coordinate all those different people and how i didn't have the energy or the will to do it as i had enough things at the office to take care of, filled my head. Once i moved the focus from what everyone else might want to do and where to go and how to best accomodate everyone, to where i thought it would be n ice to go everything became much simpler. My partner decided he had something better to do and did not join even though we rarely get to go out with friends, which would normally have ruined my evening but today i decided i really needed to have some fun w ith friends and enjoy myself and i was not going to let anything get in the way and was going to take care of this another day. We had a great time out. P7 36 XX:XX NS Woke up from that dream laughing, because it seemed so absurd, especially that word, \"h ip-lally\". I still felt light in my body and mind, but less of a helium balloon. I felt a bit tired, but much more energetic than the previous days P5 18 05:45 NS The \"get things done\" mode continued. Got up feeling vital, went to the office, made a list of all the things that needed to be dealt with, had a meeting with my brother, insisted about looking into them straight away (usually I hold a more supporting role, he sets the pace and sometimes end up just hanging around until he is free so we can do wh atever we need to do) as i had things of my own to do and wanted to leave (usually it is work first and ends up taking over our lives but not today). I went home, had a quick bite and went to a beauty care exhibition even though time was really tight (usua lly when there is not ample time i just don't do whatever it is i want to do), bought a few things i needed in no time (extremely unusual), returned home, changed and went to my dance lesson. I usually spend more time thinking about things i have to do and less on actually doing them and consequently have a much much slower pace. At the end of the day i was feeling more vital even though i had been running non -stop all day. P7 18 XX:XX NS woke up feeling more vital, feeling like myself again. P7 13 08:00 N S Got up and felt very energised, on top of th world; did some housework, then my energy suddenly dropped down, I felt terribly tired, like I needed to go back to bed; then I had a chat with my mother and I felt very energised again, like lifted up; then it balanced for the rest of the day P5 14 08:05 AS Very relaxed, focused, extremely still in a grounded and stable way, with a blank and still/quiet mind that made it easy to stay in a meditative state and keep completely still. Empty - but clear -headed. P11 1 00:07 NS Everything seems more slow than usual; usually I'm working at a high -speed tempo with an alert but busy and high -wired mind; today my mind is focused, but relaxed, and more slow - but in a calm and comfortable way. P11 6 13:00 AS Feeling p ositive, focussed, relaxed, optimistic. Continues for rest of day. P1 34 08:00 RS Still feeling positive, focussed, relaxed, optimistic. P1 34 14:50 RS Still feeling positive, focussed, relaxed, optimistic. P1 36 13:00 RS Energy feels much better today. Got down to mental work easily and was focussed P1 7 09:00 RS Feeling full of energy, focused & determined P10 4 09:00 OS After class instead of my usual reading a nice book or meditating I watched all the homework videos and a video on cancer as I still felt focused and determined P10 2 19:00 OS I write my proving diary for the first time in 4 days! Feel focussed and able to concentrate on it. P1 32 09:00 RS I feel unusually calm and focused about the work I need to be getting on with rather than my usual overwhelmed by everything feeling P10 2 08:30 OS Energy returns as soon as I get home. Am able to focus on mental (light) and practical housework type tasks. P1 17 17:00 RS A bit difficult to focus on tasks and get them done. P1 33 1 2:00 RS Manage to do and finish focussed work with colleague (write journal proposal) . > thinking togetherP1 33 16:30 RS More able focus on intellectual work tasks e.g. analysis of homeopathy case,and get something done. > thinking/talking with other people P1 33 12:00 RS I had a talk with my Mum after work and after a run; I laid my heart out to her, have tried to do so a couple of times in the last four years since she had her first stroke and our close relationship was suddenly non - excistant, whic h I know has been sad and hard for both of us to deal with. I think this time it will not just be \"one of those talks that don't lead to anything after all\", because I am quite decided on not just pretending everything is alright anymore (after the very ha rd, difficult, emotional summer), and because she is really working hard with herself after the stroke she had in July - she is now getting the follow -up she should have gotten four years ago, and I think it is a good time for our, in my opinion slightly -broken - and-in-a-crisis -family, to work through some issues; babysteps. I cannot do it all in one go; my Dad feels a bit left out because I invited only my Mum, it has been mostly my Dad I have seen more of the two, because things have been awkward with my M um; but my Dad has needed so much support the last year with his cancer, which he is now finished treatment with successfully, but he is not being a support himself - and I cannot continue my \"giving -support -and-pretending -everything -is-okay -with -me\" -thing. I have talked to my Mum, and I will talk to my Dad, and when I see him, also my brother; but in a pace that isn't to draining (I don't want to end up as the same emotional wreck again as I was during the summer, even though I miss being close to my fami ly). (So: in a place where I have the capacity to work on difficult emotions and realtionships, after having been incapable - and been unable do do anything but avoid them - as soon as I knew my Dad was done with his treatment and my Mum had the follow -up she needed. Then I had room for my own first real heart -break from the beginning of July to surface, which felt like it would really have suffocated me, if it hadn't been for me finally seeing my homoeopath (as I am not good at sharing with my friends, and couldn't manage to relate to my family at that point) and get to air it out and talk about my depression. P11 5 18:00 AS I have now also had a kind of \"heart to heart\" with my brother too; being open about everything going on with our parents, and with e ach other - as I have initiated with my Mum and Dad recently too. P11 35 18:00 RS It was time to put away summer clothes and bring down winter clothes but rearranging the closet always felt like a huge task and i had managed to avoid it so far. With the w hole dripping thing and half my stuff already out i just decided it was time to do it. Still felt huge nevertheless, i just got started and then little by little i am getting it done. Again the tendency was to get it done and not get it done perfectly. P7 19 XX:XX NS Felt good to be back in my body, outside, feeling muscles work. P1 36 08:00 RS Feeling again I have made a great day, choose to organise play dates for kids with nice people, arranged a dinner with someone else and again cooked dinner made ca kes and had other kids over, feeling calm pleasant and present with the kids. P2 39 07:12 RS Noticed absence of hot flushes today. A day of and spent a great deal of it running around outside and in car doing shopping n mum taxi service. >>>outside >>>fre sh air. P4 6 XX:XX OS Very impatient to cause change. P2 4 01:00 NS Feeling a little impatient and agitated, taking a day being gentle with my skedule. P2 32 09:07 RS Inability to focus P8 19 16:15 NS trying to get my hair done and no matter how I try I see lack of hair on my head, looks awful. Hair does not cover head and you can see through patches of bold scalp. P12 36 XX:XX NS laugh at self as realise the noise irritation is the wind in the ensuite moving the bath panel and making it squeak li ke the floorboards! P9 14 07:00 NS Many thoughts but abstract, unable to focus and actually sort them out and put them down. Tried studying but unable to focus. (not very unusual but the intensity and duration are quite unusual) P7 4 11:00 NS Doing tax a ccounts and feeling \"I'm back on top of things, I can do this\" P2 4 11:16 NS Thinking about orange on and off for the last few days. P1 17 10:00 RS When I woke up I had a deep, vibrant orange in my mind. P1 6 04:00 NS Lying flat on my back in bed: palpi tations, can feel my heart beating strongly and forcefully, so that I can feel my body move/pulse into the mattress. Feel like my body is in a state of stress, though my mind is at ease and not worried. (Have had it since 2010 to some degree - and it used to worry me, because it was during a time when I was unwell. Don't have it much anymore, but now and then, and usually in connection with a stressor of some kind - and it's not worrying, just something I observe and take as a sign to stress less.) P11 12 0 7:00 RS Palpitations - pretty strong, can feel the palpitations echoing through my chest, from my heart; strong thumps, making me aware of my breathing, kind of unnerving, and I feel like it will be tiring in the long run. P11 7 15:00 RS Palpitations. Th ough surprisingly calm considering everything going on with regard to my workplace. P11 43 20:00 RS Seemed to get a great deal sorted out today, took a day of from work, refusing to work through poor pay actually and to sort out clinic space instead. So p roductive. P4 32 XX:XX NS Woke up and couldn't get back to sleep until gone 5. My mind was racing with all the things I need to do and I felt completely overwehlmed. P10 22 02:38 NS Continuation of the above: I still have enough energy to unpack, hand in some work, update my proving diary, and also meet up for a social gathering later this evening - after 9 hours of travel. This is a higher energy -level than I usually operate at, and I find it refreshing. Normally I would feel in a rush to get the unpacki ng out of the way, because it's something that needs to be done anyway, and it will churn around in my head if I don't do it; this time it was no effort, and I still felt like I had energy left for the rest of the evening. P11 4 16:00 AS saw myself doing repetitive mouth movements like pouting in train window reflection P9 1 02:01 NS felt better as recovering from acute condition accelerated. Feel more energy, less inflammation and more sense of well being P12 1 16:XX CS I have also noticed throughout the proving my eyes/sight has been a lot worse especially in the mornings, my vision seems to clear up late morning. P10 46 11:20 NS My sense of smell is so keen that I could smell the breath of the osteopath as he gave me some treament. It was n't unpleasant, it smelled of him but I have never noticed this before. P2 12 04:48 RS Feeling very positive, sociable, less shy than I usually am at Hawkwood with 4th years. Feeling more myself, uninhibited, playful P1 0 21:00 RS Feeling very sociable > company P1 33 19:00 RS Not too worried about speaking to people; ususally I am really self -aware in groups of people; I've got my guard up and am really contained, not opening up and relaxing, even if I want to. Today I was effortlessly talking to other s, not stressed or constantly having a voice in my head analysing what I am saying - how people respond to me - and how I might be perceived in the situation; which usually drains me quite a lot, and keeps me on the alert/tensed up. P11 29 12:00 AS I've been told that I was putting my right hand up to my nose and mouth while talking about something either funny or qute intense; I never used to do that before. Also, I started to realise I was doing many more things with my left hand whereas I'm right -handed P5 43 18:00 NS Yoga: More strained and muscles tired easily; usually I get worn out from the effort of the poses, but today it was more intense/more present - as if my body was more closely wired to my head than usual. P11 7 18:00 AS We went to my part ner's parents, and I only felt stressed and emotional by the end of the afternoon; usually, I feel stressed as soon as we get in the house P5 34 08:30 NS Time moving quickly, yet what I had achieved was so little, it felt like. Yet, not really. I was/am a mazed at how much I squeeze into a day, and yet feel I achieve very little. P4 6 14:55 NS time passes too quickly at home; but normal outside of home P8 44 14:00 NS time passes too quickly P8 18 15:00 NS triangles, thinking a lot about triangles...and how when two becomeclose the thrid one is pushed further...the children around me keep fighting when they are 3 together and makes me think about triangles P14 14 16:00 NS unable to do multitask and have to focus on one subject at a time P 8 54 19:00 NS Unable to express my thoughts - marked P8 20 13:15 IOS Even though I set the washing machine I still do not register that I am up an hour earlier than I need to be until I come to leave the house P9 31 06:10 NS I was on holiday and using a sun lounger with metal legs they were all covered with calcium build -up (scale) and I was going to treat it by dipping the lounger in a vat of acid type fluid P9 20 05:00 NS I go for a bus and in the road I drop something an stop to pick it up, I am nearly run over, I get on the bus and start to do some knitting, I am making a shopping bag, someone sits down next to me a bodges the needles making me drop stitches this happens several times. Feeling of dream is frustrated, but also inspires me to ma y be knit something! P9 13 XX:XX NS I am on holiday, here where I am (Mallorca) and cycling on a hire bike, I realised it was getting dark and decided to invent disposable bike lights. They would look like normal lights but be full of chemicals and when you shake them they last for four hours for emergencies if you forget your lights. I thought I was very clever P9 6 04:00 NS the builders moving the furniture were able to give me a set of plans and when I opened the book they were the history of the sit e in video as though filmed from the top of a bus, I watched this closely and told the builders where to put everything P9 16 XX:XX NS When I go back to the table where I put my stuff I realise I am hogging a table that is huge and need to move it as the re are now a lot more people around P9 32 XX:XX NS woke up wet...the duvet was wet P14 43 XX:XX NS Less sense of unease as I wake. I'm eager to see how the kitten is. Relieved to see him eat a bit and drink. P1 32 07:00 NS Woke up at 2:30 and couldn't g et back to sleep until nearly 5am. My mind is very productive, I managed to write an article I've been meaning to write for some time P10 20 02:35 OS Woke up at 2:45 and couldn't get back to sleep until bearly 5am. But that time awake was very productive I wrote something in my head that I've been trying to write for 8 months.

Moaning & complaining, Powerlessness, Desire to withdraw, feeling miserable. Coldness and indifference. Cried in the arms of a collegue at work; something I don't do. I have let the people at work know, in a more \"factual/informative\" way, about grievances in my personal life d uring the summer - but not at all revealing my emotions, or crying, in front of any of them. That I only do in solitude. When crying in my collegue's embrace at work I felt relief, security, comfort. (AS: because of the opening up in a very unusual way for me; as I don't even open up that much/make myself vulnerable/share things on a very deep level wtih close friends even) P11 3 03:00 AS A friend calls.

It was so huge that at a point we took a bus to get to where we were going. Who I was with is a bit vague. But at some point during the bus ride I was with some friends of mine. When we came to our destination, it was at a friend of a friend's place - which I relate to a place where this same friend of a friend has a fun festival -event every summer. I have never managed to go to this festival. Everyone were crying because of my friend; I am not sure why, but they were all crying over her. And when they were all finished crying, i t was 'my turn' to cry. The tears poured from my eyes in constant streams - and they were of a whitish colour, as if a high -concentration salt -solution, or a washed - white colour as if having rinsed a paintbrush with white paint in the water. One of my frie nds was eyeing me with some concern and wonder, because of the intensity and the character of my crying. It was a weird, but at the same time liberating, experience - the crying and flow of tears in the company of my friends; but without anyone actually addressing it. Before I woke up we were getting something to eat. I don't eat bread, and there was only bread there; I didn't mind, because I didn't feel like there was a need to make any fuss. *** The atmosphere/sensations in the dream are kind of familiar to me, though I cannot put my finger on what it is - the atmosphere/mood/energy in the air is kind of anticipatory; at the verge of something, but at a standstill too; this kind of tense but relaxed feel; A change of some sort is to occur - an event? a moo d? don't know if positive or negative - but at the moment it is at a standstill, and could \"break out at any minute\".

Grief for two children I lost - one termination and one ectopic pr egnancy. The lecture is about sentience and lucidity and it comes to me that I have two grandaughters after I myself lost two daughters ( a medium told me they were both girls and that they were with my mother, a different medium told my daughter - she kne w nothing about the losses I had or what the medium had told me - that she would be given a baby that her grandmother had ready for her, when the time was right).

During the lunch break I have a real sob - this is similar to the last two Sundays at the same time. I feel that it will pass within an hour or so as it has each of the previous weeks, but it is more inte nse. P9 30 13:00 RS We were out for a nice evening, and met a friend of ours without his wife; he told us she was in a bad mood and that they were about to divorce.

I tried to hang out with the guy who broke my heart in July, as just friends; i t was sad: I miss him, but I don't want to be pushy or involve myself when he doesn't want me to. (After having played the game we enjoyed playing when we started dating, with the guy I have been seeing a bit recently?) *** First in the dream: I was in my family's house: Surrounded by water/the sea; some walls covered by something similar to the protective plastic shields they use at building sites when there are no windows - I thought \"they will have to do something about this soon\".

Always a wall of emotion confronting me, that I have to deal with. Me rescuing every one, and always finding a way, and being successful at this. Up to a point. The state of collapse at the end is me now. I feel like I am struggling, that there is no joy, which makes me sad. I don't feel confident or able to do what makes me dance. I recog nise that this dream is about how sad I feel at being here. How sad I feel for my daughter and with whom I have a different relationship with as a result of all the recent past. Also, that sometimes we cannot find our way with each other, and, that taking control like I have has led us through to a barren, wasted joyless place. Alone. My perception ,is not hers. I feel affected by the weather right now. I really absolutely hate wet, cold weather. It reminds me of my own sad childhood, wanting to be free whe n it rained. I didn't want to bring up my child in this weather but here we are. I came for so many reasons, to keep my marriage going and our family together, rescuing them. For my parents to help them, but they never call. They made it so difficult to ig nore there struggles, and the age difficulties, when I called them from My old home. I felt so guilty. But I'm here and at first they pushed me away and made me feel dreadfully guilty, for imposing. So I moved to where it would be good for me. Now I know t hey appreciate me, but I feel I have to always go there, but worse that I am stuck and I shall not be able to leave until they aren't here anymore. Which is dreadful not only to imagine I'm placing life on hold for this but that I'm almost keeping a secret from them. More important than this, my daughter. She and I. I realise I am putting my own self in front of her. This is not the proving but it's how I feel. P4 46 07:30 OS My eyes are very blurred despite wearing my glasses.

It was similar to in the caf\u00e9 yesterday. We had a very peaceful Saturday easy & calm no rushing out to school or anything. I did some house jobs, I played with the childre n we did some ball games, girly hair stuff. Then i realised something i had let go a few days ago had bothered me and i got very angry. Its not something i feel is necassarily unusual, but the difference i feel is that i can see it happen very clearly and why its happening. The thing was that i had bought something i wanted to try to help my youngest to walk, but it wasn't right so i planned to return it to the shop, and not wast money. My older daughter 4 year old, wanted to assemble all the attachments an d i said no becuase they would not come off again and i would not be able to return it. Later in the day i saw they had been put on, and today as i tried to box it up and get it ready i realised my mis -managing it,i had let the situation go how i did not w ant it too. i should have put it away in the begining.

I have stopped meditating and spent that time watching and rea ding the news and Facebook instead for some bizaar reason. I feel very angry and irritated and I just want this all to end now. I don't like feeling like this and being angry at the flick of a switch. I want to delete myself from Facebook and remove myself from the civilised world but some of my most treasured and oldest friends from other countries are on FB and it's the easiest way to keep in touch. I feel powerless, there's so much I want to do and can't seem to do it. Whether that is my homework, my fut ure career, things with my children and relationship, Syria, how I spend my days, there is a complete and utter feeling of powerless. P10 46 02:00 NS Sudden outburst of rage whilst driving. Screamed at the top of my voice at the man driving in front of me (for very slight reason) so long and hard that it hurt my throat.

Angry with myself for being disgruntled and angry and upsetting my daughter over this. We get on and both have a good day but it could have been better since we bickered on and off. So went to bed exha usted. My dream was of water which to me is always sign of emotion for me. Myself and a young woman at the beach, has taken us a while to get there but we are there loving the fresh air and freedom. We are sitting very high up on a wall, and we don't know if we can hear it first or see it. But a huge tsunami of water is coming. It's energy is overwhelming. I say come on we Gotta go, she won't budge. I pursuade her to come with me, and run. As we come up the beach I have noticed a thin old looking man who ha s been watching us but secretly from behind. Not joining in but being there, he is familiar. But he's fallen asleep. He hadn't bothered us but I wanted to help him. He wouldn't wake up. So I picked him up and slung him over my shoulders like a sack of potatoes. We ran, as fast as we could. We always had the threat of the water behind us but I weaved us through the back streets that were familiar but seemed to be taking us back in time but always uphill, and always sort of behind the scenes. We came acro ss a fun fair, which was deserted, but then realised it was because we were inside the structures. There was water but only rainwater that had collected. The water from the tsunami was nearer, deafening. We jumped clambered, ran climbed and all the time th rough familiar yet back stage. We got to an circle of escalators and ran backwards up them when the doors opened at the top we had reached the end. The tsunami had hit and we could see people running, there was a small white dog and I was reaching for it t rying to rescue it, but I just couldn't reach it. The people ran over it, there was blood, it didn't look real. I was more sad for the dog than any of the people. We had passed so many who hadn't listened to the warnings. After a time of exhaustion from the panic escape, we starting going back to see what had happened. People were back at the funfair but we're looking at us weirdly, where had we come from. Telling us we weren't allowed to join in the fun, we didn't want to we were just passing. When we got back to the beach, we found people had chained and locked themselves to railings, and we're still there living normal lives but chained down. There was music playing. We were sitting at a beach bar. I wanted to dance, so started to tap my feet, by this ti me I was chained too, and limited in my ability. I seemed to be content to be semi dancing, but knew I could really dance. Then this fella came over he was unchained!! And started to rock n roll with a short skirt on in front of me, he wanted to dance and took my hand. I stepped of the beach bar stool to dance, bit nervous but collapsed to the ground. My body danced and my feet but my legs just didn't work anymore. I was exhausted. After all the panic, escape, rescuing going back in time and finally findin g some kind of normal I couldn't go on and was in a state of collapse.

Fear but also relief at thought of death. P1 21 07:00 RS Our dying dog was in my grandmother's house (who lived next door to us). In my opinion, and feeling, it was too sick to be kept alive rather than mercifully put to sleep. I needed to find my Mum and Dad and tell them, so that they too could realise how much suffering our dog was going through, and how it was time for us to take it to the vet/all ow it to be comfortable in the last moments. Because it was clearly in pain. *** I got associations with our dog, who had to be put to sleep at the end of this summer due to a tumour in her bowels - that we didn't discover before it was too late. I was the one who took care of her the most when I was home, and I got the feeling that some of the neglect for our dog - that I have been frustrated about - was also present in the dream, when I was desperately looking for my parents to make them see how much pain the dog was in.

When i got to her she was in a bit of a state and i told her that she had to tell him what she had done, she started crying and said she couldn' t but then i told her that keeping stuff like that inside is what might have caused her current condition (she has been struggling with aplastic anaemia for about 7years, she is a person who has extreme mental control and deals with everything in that way even her illness both the physical aspect (she sort of wills herself to get better) as well as the emotional one) and then she said she would do it and we went off to somewhere.

Sitting facing me, with him kneeling on ground performing cutting into vein to insert a very large canulae . Abnormally large, almost archaic. Would have been hideously painful. But she was stro ng , stoic and calm. Tourniquet in place, he cut in and found the vein.( There is a part in venapuncture when one searches for the vein it is -I feel - very painful and uncomfortable. Subsequently I do not take bloods at work makes me feel sick and cringe I feel for the poor patient. But in the dream I was looking upon quite placidly and horrifyingly interested.) He obviously mislaid the vein and went into an artery. Her arm south of the tourniquet blew up into a large extremitie. Then, a dusky earthen col oured blood oozed yet pumped out slowly. Everything went slow motion. We all watched from afar. Like a silent horror.( I woke unafraid but repulsed because it amazes me I just cannot take pathology) the feeling behind the dream is the emotion of strength g uidance and calm from Janet. Kneeling to learn from her 'son'. And our collective disaffected detached horror, also the colour and quality of the blood was strange and significant.

I have noticed it many times lately, as compared to now and then (once a month? every three months??) usually. I think that it is mostly/only outdoors, especially if the air is very fresh and crisp. P11 26 13:00 AS Cough up yellow mucus P10 13 19:30 OS Cough up yellow mucus P10 14 07:45 OS yellow discharged after getting flue/cold P12 43 08:20 RS Yellow- y coryza after a walk outdoors, cleared quickly P6 23 18:00 RS Very painful, scratchy and dry, with watery eyes, and right running nostril P4 10 08:30 NS I feel quite ill with a cold, it has finally arrived properly during the day too. P10 46 08:30 RS Coryza, bland, from both nostrils P1 51 09:00 NS Lumps, bumps Bulge, lump, spot, bite, jelly, squidgy An almost ache in my throat - a lump sensation in the back of my throat/when swallowing; a cotton -like sensation, as of a layer of cotton being pressed towards the sides of my throat, below the jaw. P11 15 08:00, RS The jelly -lump in my abdomen/solar plexus area is still there; and today I was consious of it actually being \"activated\" or \"turned on\" when I have this apprehension towards speaking out loud, or in any way placing myself in other people's attention. I have not been aware of this \"activation\" of it before; but in a way it made sens e to me, though I can't explain it; to me it is kind of a physical manifestation of the mental/emotional apprehension and stress/anxiety that I have, and so when I was having the urge to say something out loud in the group - and I felt my jelly -lump kind o f being energised - it made sense for it to do so... Though I have not noticed this connection before, and I think it has to do with the experience that I had of the jelly- lump being worked on by me in the state that I am. It is as if expressing some frustration over not voicing/sharing my thoughts which would usually feed into the jelly- lump and stay there - but which is now actually more interactive with the jelly lump; more of a process than locking stuff up. P11 29 14:00 AS lumps start to appear along jaw line, itchy P9 1 04:50 NS bitten on right arm itching P9 7 16:13 NS bitten on inside right ankle P9 9 11:47 NS A \"bobble -sensation\", as of a lump of jelly, just behind my sternum and heart - and it felt like the lump was going to hicchough. (Altered because: it doesn't usually feel like it's going to hicchough; it is present as a heavy straining lump, that feels like it is a bit in the way of my breathing; taking up some of the space where there would otherwise be more space when inhaling.) P11 2 14:30 AS coldsore, (with a head i squized it) P14 32 08:00 NS Two growths are growing between my legs and reach down to my knees. One is thin and lined with knobbly growths and blisters. The other is much thicker: pink and covered in skin - looks a bit more like a penis. I'm embarrassed and in denial. I find it very difficult to talk about them although they're so obvious that other people notice them. I fob them off and say I will go to the doctor some time to see about them. Want people to stop mentioning them. P1 16 06:30 RS Had sensation of a bulge in left temple, as if you're rolling a sleeve up; it then went to my right temple, then stopped altogether P5 1 19:30 NS itchy spots, have to scratch them to stop itching...i had them in my teenagerhood and have been returning in the past year and now slighty different P14 16 10:00 AS further spots similar to day 16 on nose and left cheek, slightly itchy - last 3 days P9 19 19:00 NS I noticed two spots on the upper part of my left buttock; t hey were itching as from tic or mosquito stings, but my partner later checked and saw no tic there, just redness; they lasted for more than a week, gradually going down in size and itching less and less P5 47 17:30 NS coldsore, itchy P14 34 09:00 NS bite on left foot instep, really itching, scratching made worse P9 6 04:00 RS bite on arm itching needed to get up and put something on it P9 9 03:09 RS The jellowy lump in my chest is taking up a lot of space today, so that it is harder to catch a full breath - as if not enough space for the air in my lungs, because the lump is protruding into the lungs' normal space. P11 7 07:45 AS Bowels filled up with air, accompanied by a light (floaty?) sensation in the solar plexus -area (behind lower part of sternum, just above abdominal cavity), where I usually have a more of a jelly -lump -sensation; so my previous sensation was alleviated. The jelly -lump usually feels like it is constricting my breathing, and is therefore a bit straining; the more floaty sensation fee ls like it relieves the heaviness/strain somewhat. P11 1 00:07 OS After yoga: Feels as if I'm breathing around the jelly -like lump; as if my body is now tackling it from all around it, trying to get a sense of it, and work its way through it. P11 7 19:30 AS Lump on my left side is still there and feels a little more solid, same size. It feels uncomfortable if I move it or press it, but doesnot hurt on its own. P2 12 02:52 RS I found a \"squidgy\"soft moving bulge on my left side, as I raised my arms it showed, by my ribs about where my bra would be. I feels as though its in -between my ribs. P2 1 08:57 NS A painful \"lump\" under the right side of my left heal, painful to step on, as if stepping on a pole protruding through my heal - or a continuation of my leg- bone through the sole of my foot, or about to go through. P11 6 07:22 OS I can feel a sensation in my abdomen that is triggered by me not speaking out in class; I am holding back my own contributions to that group discussion - as I usually do - and I do think that this \"constraint\", with not \"letting it out\" (which I remember from as early as primary school, where I sat there knowing some answers or thinking I had a good question to ask without voicing it). It is as if this mental barrier of hold ing back is also running through the rest of my system, and mostly bottling up in the area of the jelly -lump in my lower chest/abdomen. I think it always has, but now that the jelly -lump is \"being worked on\" and in a way partly being allowed to get free of its barriers, I am more aware of it. Before I saw the jelly lump as a white lump of jelly, with a clear bluish white consistency like soap bubbles - now I see it as consisting of the same matter, but \"activated\"; it is glowing slightly, with a red -orange- ish glow that is neither warm nor cold, it is just continuously glowing slightly and activated. P11 29 15:00 AS The lump on my right index finger is still there, though I have not been aware of it lately. I noticed it again when I became aware of fidgeting with it. P11 28 21:00 RS The lump on my right index finger is barely noticeable compared to last night. I can feel it when running my finger over it, but I am not inclined to fidget with it as I was yesterday. P11 29 14:30 AS A tiny skin -lump on my right index finger, on the most proximal part of the phalange. It is the size of a tiny bead, and I noticed it when I started picking on it - it is not painful, it is just there. (Tiny wart?? If so - an OS) P11 17 19:00 NS I awoke very peaceful & quiet showered, lump still on my left side the same. Very happy in my own space, kind of like I've taken a drug. A mild mushroom, warm glow. I did dream but for once not able to remember it P2 2 09:00 NS feeling nauseous as lump of sick in throat P3 2 XX:XX NS Pimple just above the left corner or my mouth. P11 2 07:30 RS Puffy underneath P1 8 XX:XX RS I notice that I haven't had rosacea on left side of nose since proving started.

P2 32 08:38 NS burn throat with microwaved food right down in side my oesophagus P9 32 15:39 NS I am on a transporter, going across re the the great canal, a huge canyon. Out side there are huge stone walls, the canyon walls, stretching up endlessly with every shelf covered in red sand. Inside the transporter is like a cross between a large train and a cheap plastic m otel bar. Everything is made to last, it is utilitarian, shining. A very un- human place to hang out for a journey that is going to last weeks. There are not even enough seats for everyone. People are lying on the floor, or standing in small huddles. Those new to the transporter look refreshed, alive, well made up. Those that have been travelling a few days look tiered, dishevelled, smelly and hungry. There is a buffet, but no one is staffing it, there is food but no one knows how long it has been there. No one dares to eat it for fear of food poisoning. I have been on the transport for a few weeks, I feel slightly unsafe, everyone is on edge, this is not a safe way to travel. There are guards that are very unfriendly and that stop you moving around. I have a pack of processed pre -sliced cheese, like the stuff you put on burgers. Plastic cheese, I eat a slice a day to keep me going. P13 2 00:03 NS There has been a cat theme in this proving, so I though I should mention I have bought my cat a big stock of food, I've been meaning to for a while find a cheaper supply and found the new large store was doing a special deal and so have come back with about 2 months suppply of this favourite yummy food.& treats.

He had brought the bread I make for myself (seeds, no grains or flour), so that when it was my turn t o get bread, he dug into the pile of bread -slices and handed me my bread with a kind of cheeky and playful grin. It was a humourous moment. (RS: I had the feeling of this part with the bread being related to the previous dream, with the part of us having b read, and me not eating bread..)

Me and R have just moved into a house. The roof is leaking (our roof at home is actually leaking) and water is coming through the ceiling. Then there is a lot of poltergeist activity, w ith ghosts appearing, objects moving through the air and people being able to move objects through the air through telekinesis. All very creepy.

He's very friendly to me - this is very good after all the shame. He hugs me goodby and as he does I notice blood on his shirt. More and more blood and we can't see where it's comin g from on his body. Take off his shirt and look. PANIC rising. Blood seeping out of what looks like bullet holes from his back and side, but as soon as I touch the skin the hole disappears and yet he's still bleeding profusely. PANIC! He will bleed to death!!! I've got to sort it out. No one else around. I'm responsible. But the task is beyond me. I get a duvet cover and try to wrap him up very tightly to stop the bleeding. Blood seeps thought the material. I wake. I'm feeling very anxious as I wake up and don't know why - I can't remember the dream.

I don't like the way in which she demands things without there being a true dialogue, and the way she is micro -controlling everything to meet her personal preferences rather than everyone having a say in matters that actually d o affect everyone. If she doesn't like what I have to say, then I will resign and find another place that is working better in terms of the management of things and the leader's style/skills. I feel a bit scared by the concept of \"demanding\" this kind of t alk, because it is out of my comfort -zone, but at the same time I feel like I have to in order to rid myself of a stressor in my everyday life.

P11 31 12:45 AS A fellow student commented that I hadn't been croucheting at all during the wekend so far; usually I am crocheting during lectures if there isn't anything particular that I want to write in my notes, and in the evenings when we are sitting and chatting. Usually the crocheting is solely an enjoyment and part of me ralaxing and having a calm and nice time, either with friends or while watching telly; but at the school weekends it kind of occured to me that it might have been more to do with distracting myself from the social awkwardness/anxiety I experience with being with people I don't fully know - and that the crochet can act as an activity to quiet/distract from that a bit. Not doing so much of it this weekend s eems to be connected to me being more at ease and comfortable within me, without all the mental stress about how I am connecting to/getting on with everyone else - and adapting to the setting/people around me.
