Syn- onyms for the word rant include shout, wild, fulmi- nate, vociferate, diatribe, sound off, spout, pontificate, bluster, tirade, yell , and bellow. Who wouldn't feel better after all of that is said and done? At the BCMJ we review all sorts of submissions for publication. I re-main in awe of authors who put them-selves out there and take the time to craft a scientific paper, letter, or opin-ion piece. Risking rejection, the cre-ative individuals writing scientific papers design and complete studies, analyze the data, organize it into a pa-per with a discussion and conclusion, and support it all with references. I appreciate the time, effort, and en-ergy this process requires. However, there are certain things that drive us crazy at the BCMJ Editorial Board, and I hope that by ranting about one of them, change will follow. I think I have night terrors about acronyms. For some reason many authors feel they must use acronyms wherever possible. I addressed this issue in a previous tongue-in-cheek editorial (www.bcmj.org/editorials/ do-abbrs-bother-u) in the hope of eradicating this trend. Alas, little changed after my editorial's publica - tion (cementing my conviction that readership of my editorials consists more of family members than BCMJ authors). I am asking, pleading, and begging on behalf of the Editorial Board for authors to cease and desist. Numerous acronyms in a manu- script make it difficult to read and de-tract from its message. I'm not talking about commonly used acronyms we all understand like DM for diabetes mellitus or CAD for coronary ar - tery disease. I am talking about the obscure ones that not even the most scholarly readers understand. On brief perusal of last month's manu-script submissions I found RB, ICC, LIC, CAS, , YLL, YLD, DAD, ERAT, SBIRT, HDSA, and CMHA. Perhaps I'm not up to speed, but I don't think this list contains any generally accepted fre-quent flyers. It is much better to use the actual words than an acronym be-cause surely the objective is to con-vey meaning, not save space in the BCMJ or avoid the nuisance of typ- ing? Also, for the love of everything holy, please don't use an acronym for a two-word phrase such as FD for family doctor or ED for emergency department (most of us middle-aged men think ED stands for something else anyway). Finally, to prevent me from having a hypertensive stroke, don't create an acronym for a phrase if is only used once in a manuscript. I'm not trying to deter prospective authors, but I am striving to reduce the total number of Editorial Board member facial tics that develop each time another unnecessary acronym is used. Remember that at the BCMJ we really do appreciate and look forward to the submissions that we receive, so keep up the good work. For my next rant perhaps I will focus on low response rate survey studies? \u2014DRR, FD, EDeditorials www.johnson.ca/doctorsofbcI have night terrors about acronyms. 186 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 4, may 2018 bcmj.orgIf you have ever ordered a pneu- moencephalogram, administered an aminophylline drip, cross-eyed stereo-viewed a cerebral angiogram, or used Tensilon to convert paroxys-mal atrial tachycardia, then you are likely retired or in the retirement-contemplative stage. So it is with me. After 40 years in medicine it's time to retire and also step down from my 10-year membership on the BCMJ Editorial Board, which of all the com-mittees I've served on has been my favorite. The membership of the Editorial Board is composed of a diverse group of talented physicians and staff who, while not always like-minded, have always been able to achieve consen-sus on which articles would be of val-ue and interest to BC physicians. The fact that the BCMJ is celebrating its We serve our patients, not our com - puters. No technology will ever re-place our care. There are also political, econom- ic, and societal pressures that will change the way we practise medi-cine. For instance, our role in being accountable to only our own patients is increasingly being challenged. We must be cognizant of the provincial government's frustration that despite huge financial expenditures there is a perception that collectively we sit on the sidelines while patients are un-able to access timely medical care. In Quebec this has resulted in draconian incursions into physician autonomy by the introduction of Bill 130, which includes physicians having to guar - antee availability of service. While in BC we may feel that we are doing enough by collaborating with govern-ment on initiatives such as the Gen-eral Practice Services and Specialist Services committees, there are many poorly accessible services. We must vigorously promote and publicize our collaborative engagements, and barri-ers when they exist, \"in matters relat - ing to public health, health education, environmental protection, legislation, function, and improvement of health services.\" 1 Just as I never envisioned retir - ing from medicine, someday, if you are lucky, that day will arrive for you. It might seem far away for some, but it's not. Plan for it just as diligently as you planned your career. Ask your - self, aside from medicine, what gives you the joy, excitement, and purpose that will fuel your retirement years. I have been very privileged to have been part of this Editorial Board. Thank you. \u2014WRV 1. Canadian Medical Association. CMA code of ethics (2004): 42. Responsibilities to society.

It is always interesting to reflect on one's past view of the future, ver - sus today's reality. For instance, I never saw the coming of plastic wa-ter bottles, Starbucks coffee, yoga, or that being tattoo-positive did not equate with being MSP-negative. I've always believed that patient autono-my and self-determination would ex-tend to the end of life, and am relieved that medical assistance in dying has finally been decriminalized. I never saw the value of medical marijuana, but never saw the harm in decriminal - izing marijuana, even if I don't like the smell of a skunk. For many de-cades my dream was to have a fully functional integrated EMR complete with lab and diagnostic imaging re-sults, patient scheduling, data track-ing, and prescribing software. Many years and dollars later I came to sym-pathize with the builders of the Tower of Babel. I'm hopeful for the day that all physicians can truly say that their EMR has resulted in delivery of safer and more efficient care. If I may also reflect on the future of medicine, I see it as promising, exciting, and somewhat daunting, particularly with regard to technolog-ical changes that will challenge most physicians' ability to remain current. Advances in laboratory medicine, genetics, diagnostic imaging, and in-formatics are staggering, but in all its marvels we must remember that tech - nology is our servant, not our master.

Many health authorities have developed no-refusal policies for the extremely ill, and this is a cru-cial requirement if we are to develop a truly patient-centred health care sys-tem. But it still takes too long to find an accepting hospital, delaying trans-fers in a dangerous way. The second problem is access to and availability of the proper mode of transport and the personnel to physi-cally move the patient from point A to B. Our ambulance system works extremely hard with the resources it has, but there aren't enough planes in the right places, enough helicop-ters, or enough ground ambulances to move all the patients quickly and effi-ciently. We also don't have enough of the right paramedics and other trans-port personnel in the right places at the right times. A review published by the Ap- plied Policy Research Unit at UBC analyzed best practices and generated suggestions for an evidence-based re-organization of the system. The work was supported by the Rural and Re-mote Division of Family Practice and the Rural Coordinating Centre of BC, both of which are funded through Doctors of BC and the Ministry of Health. Several ongoing projects arose from this work, one with North-ern Health and BC Emergency Health Services, and a Rural Patient Trans-fer and Transport Working Group that reports to the Ministry of Health Select Standing Committee on Popu-I like to travel. I like to drive and I like to fly. From the airplane I like to look down on snow-covered mountain peaks, deep valleys, moun-tain passes, and little winding roads. But travel isn't always reliable. Bad weather can be notorious for causing flights to be canceled or road condi-tions to be treacherous. For me, the worst that can happen in these situa - tions is that I need to cancel a meeting or event, or I arrive late. But what if the journey is time-sensitive\u2014a life or death situation? What if we we're talking about the challenge of moving a critically ill or injured patient from a location that can't provide definitive care to one that can? All of a sudden the terrain isn't a beautiful view from above, but rather a transportation chal-lenge where travel delays aren't just inconvenient, they're possibly fatal. Red transfers are classified as those involving life or limb-threatening con ditions. In rural communities the issues and processes around red trans-fers have been identified as some of the biggest stressors that rural physi-cians face. Dealing with any serious illness or severe trauma is stressful for most physicians, but particularly so when you practise in a low-resource environment and such cases are in-frequent. The basic approach is the same\u2014assess, resuscitate, stabilize, and arrange for definitive care. But the last item on that list generally involves a journey by either ground or air am-bulance to a tertiary care hospital, and this is where we run into trouble. Identifying the preferred destina- tion and convincing them to take your patient is only the first step, and of-ten there is a major impediment. We all know our hospitals are constantly overcapacity. Most often this overca - pacity isn't due to very sick patients, but rather those who can't go home It's not about the destination, it's about the journey. Or is it? lation Health Services. The Community Paramedicine Program is an-other program designed to address some of these needs. So while much work is in pro gress, only time will tell if the commitment to changing and improving the system in BC produces visible results. Trauma and extreme illness are unpredictable. Too much of our health care planning involves implementing resources and personnel to the bare minimum required. It is done because of cost constraints and because in our publicly funded system we have a re-sponsibility to account for the spend-ing of taxpayer money. But in health, ultimately, this is a false economy. Timely initial treatment is crucial for potential recovery. The slower our re-sponse and the more delays in treat-ment, the more it costs us in actual health care dollars and in human suf-fering downstream. When it comes to patient care, the journey needs to be seamless, skilled, and efficient, be-cause the destination matters if we are to provide the right care at the right place at the right time for all citizens in British Columbia. As this is my last BCMJ Presi - dent's Comment, I want to say that the job of president has been an amazing journey. I want to thank you all for giving me the opportunity to travel with you this year. Together we can make these journeys for our patients better and work to transform the health care system in BC to one we can all be proud of. \u2014Trina Larsen Soles, MD Doctors of BC President Issues and processes around red transfers have been identified as some of the biggest stressors that rural physicians face.188 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 4, may 2018 bcmj.orgletters to the editor Re: Two-for-one private health care: A Canadian compromise I would disagree with Dr Kotaska's opinion that charging double the cost for medically necessary treatment is a justified social policy. If medical care is a right and not a privilege, then im-posing financial barriers of double the actual cost to subsidize a failing pub-lic system is mercenary. With com-petition and a market economy, costs approach value. Circumventing the Supreme Court's decision that pro-hibiting necessary care is unethical with a scheme to charge double the actual cost for medically necessary care is illegal because the Canada Health Act prohibits extra billing. Charging double is also unethical since it runs counter to the prime dir - ective and first order of the Doctors of BC Code of Ethics (www.doctorsof bc.ca/code-ethics) to \"Consider first the well-being of the patient.\" Any financial policy that delays treat - ment and prolongs suffering for an individual patient because they are unable to pay twice what the service is worth violates this edict. It's also very optimistic to imagine a 100% tax would generate a net payoff. It's like doubling down on a losing hand with stolen money. \u2014Mike Figurski, MD, CPHIMS Big Whitear Re: Two-for-one private health care: A Canadian compromise. Author replies Dr Figurski says that I suggest impos- ing financial barriers that would de-lay treatment and impose suffering on patients. I do nothing of the sort. I propose offering affluent patients expedited service for an additional fee that will be specifically applied to providing services for patients with lesser means. This is the fundamen-tal basis of a progressive taxation sys-tem. The net result will be additional capacity and shorter waiting lists for procedures undersupplied by the pub-lic health care system. The approach is ethically sound and improves the well-being of all patients compared with the status quo. With competi-tion, market forces will indeed come to bear. For the system, private facili - ties may increase efficiency. For pa - tients, as the service in economy class gets faster, fewer will choose to fly first class. Dr Figurski seemingly defends and derides the Canada Health Act, yet does not appear to understand the conflict with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms that engendered my suggestion in the first place. The Su-preme Court has not doubled down on the Canada Health Act: it has declared it unconstitutional. Free health care is not enshrined in the Charter. As the growing myriad of current violations demonstrate, the Canada Health Act is on life support. Some would hap-pily see it die; however, I believe that most Canadians would prefer a mea - sured compromise to the Wild West of unregulated private health care. \u2014Andrew Kotaska, MD Yellowknife, NWTWe welcome original letters of less than 300 words; they may be edited for clarity and length.

New York: Penguin Life, 2017. ISBN-10: 0735219796. Paperback, 224 pages. For as long as I can remem-ber, running has been a part of my life. I chose to re-view this book, Running with Mind - fulness, thinking it would improve my running\u2014in particular, getting into \"the zone\" and being surprised when reaching my destination without rec-ollection of pain, exhaustion, or the environment. However, that would be mindless running. Mindful running is just the opposite and focuses on the immediate present. In order to review this book I solicited the opinions of a few of my colleagues who are more conversant with mindfulness therapy. The author is a psychotherapist who, based on his own life struggles, developed a program to improve low-mood, anxiety, stress, and depression. It is aimed at anyone who is feeling stuck and is interested in exploring self-awareness through exercise, ei-ther alone or preferably with a partner. The first part of the book includes a useful review and description of mindfulness. The start of one's ses-sion (or run) begins with a four-stage grounding exercise. The reader is di-rected to focus on a question to ex - plore during the physical activity: \"moving with intention.\" Finally, the reader is to make notes. Although this book is labeled running with mindfulness, I think it might better be labeled exercising with mindfulness. The techniques in the book can readily be applied to any exercise that leads to the achievement of \"flow,\" a state of complete absorp-tion in the activity. The author encourages the reader to find a suitable partner willing to un-dertake the journey and to be a non-judgmental listener. This would not work for everyone, but could be use-ful for some. After the first three chapters on the basics, the book is divided into chap-ters on anxiety, depression, anger, relationships, and decision making. Each chapter has several questions to explore while exercising, along with space to record one's thoughts and conclusions. The author encourages note-making as being therapeutic. I particularly enjoyed the chapter on parents and kids. It gave me some conversation ideas to explore when running with my grandchildren. I enjoyed this book, which rein- forced what I already know about the benefits of running. It also gave me ideas to focus on during runs, rather than being mindless. Given the beneficial effect of ex- ercise on the mind, the incorporation of mindfulness therapy makes this an even better resource to recommend to patients who are struggling with anxiety, depression, and relationship issues, and it may eliminate the need for medication. \u2014WRV News continued on page 190 Call at 1-800-663-6729 or visit www.physicianhealth.com.

My involvement has been as both the IH Facility Engagement physician li-aison and chair of the Kelowna Gen-eral Hospital Facility Engagement working group. As of 2018, 20 fa - cilities across IH have initiated more than 200 Facility Engagement activ-ities. In short, the initiative at Interior Health is flourishing. When I think about where we started only a few years ago, I'm very excited to see that our sites are brim-ming with enthusiasm, particularly since there are a wide variety of proj-ects underway, and the physician en-gagement among the groups continue to be excellent and growing. Facility Engagement (www.facility engagement.ca) is a provincial initia - tive that originates from the 2014-19 Physician Master Agreement. It aims to strengthen relationships, commu - nication, and collaboration between health authorities and facility-based physicians to improve the physician work environment and the delivery of patient care. To me, one of the positive impacts of this project has been the interdivi-sional and interdepartmental opportu-nities to regularly collaborate, such as pediatrics meeting with emergency or radiology meeting with surgery; these cross-collaborations are new. Getting physicians together to discuss com-mon issues is very positive step. Interior Health has committed to supporting Facility Engagement, both with my liaison position and with Dr Harsh Hundal as an executive medi-cal director who has this initiative as an important part of his portfolio. Last December, physician rep- resentatives from each IH facility, health administrators and executives, and representatives from HEABC and the Specialist Services Commit-tee (SSC) met for the Interior Health Facility Engagement Symposium. The event was an excellent opportu-nity for learning and dialogue, to ex-change ideas, to build relationships, and for everyone to get a feel for the initiatives underway at other IH sites. While all Facility Engagement projects are unique and vary in length, they share a common theme, which is to give physicians a meaningful voice to address issues that affect them. For example, the Lillooet hospital physi-cian group has increased mental health care access for children and youth with mental health issues. Initiated by Dr Nancy Humber, the project has physi-cians working together with local and regional Interior Health representa-tives, along with schools, Indigenous counselors, and other community members. Two child and youth psy-chiatrists provide outreach clinics to Lillooet and surrounding area. At Vernon Jubilee Hospital, Dr Jason Doyle expressed concerns about redundant laboratory testing. In collaboration with the Vernon Jubilee Hospital Physician Society, they ex-amined laboratory utilization and de-veloped recurrent laboratory testing guidelines for inpatients. As a result of the changes, we hope that patients will experience less anxiety and dis-comfort and avoid unnecessary tests, and that cost savings will be realized. These are just some of the many impressive projects happening across the health authority and I am ecstatic that IH is using the Facility Engage-ment Initiative to improve areas in need . \u2014John Falconer MD, FRCPC Interior Health Facility Engagement Physician Liaison Chair, Kelowna General Hospital Facility Engagement Working Group speech technology specialists for 18 years speakeasysolutions.com 1-888-964-9109 CONT ACT US TODA Y!

As of 2016, an estimated 564 000 Canadians live with dementia (ex - pected to rise to 937 000 by 2031). The combined health care system and out-of-pocket costs of dementia is es-timated at $10.4 billion\u2014estimated to increase by 60% to $16.6 billion by 2031. The laboratory of Drs Patrick and Edith McGeer is renowned for 30 years of work in neuroinflamma-tion and neurodegenerative diseases, particularly AD. A paper detailing the McGeer's most recent discover - ies (\"Alzheimer's Disease Can Be Spared by Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflam-matory Drugs\") was published in the Journal of Alzheimer' s Disease. In 2016, Dr McGeer and his team announced that they had developed a simple saliva test that can diagnose AD, as well as predict its future on-set. The test is based on measuring the concentration of the peptide amyloid beta protein 42 (Abeta42) secreted in saliva. In most individuals, the rate of Abeta42 production is almost exact - ly the same regardless of sex or age. However, if that rate of production is 2 to 3 times higher, those individuals are destined to develop AD. Abeta42 is a relatively insoluble material made everywhere in the body but deposits of it occur only in the brain, causing neuroinflammation, which destroys neurons in the brains of people with AD. Dr McGeer's team demonstrated that the peptide is made in all organs of the body and is secreted in saliva from the submandibular gland. As a result, with one teaspoon of saliva it is possible to predict whether an indi-vidual is destined to develop AD. This allows the opportunity to begin tak-ing early preventive measures such as consuming nonprescription nonste-roidal drugs such as ibuprofen. Knowing that the prevalence of clinical Alzheimer disease commenc-es at age 65, Dr McGeer recommends that people get tested 10 years prior, at age 55, when the onset of AD would typically begin. If they exhibit ele-vated Abeta42 levels then, that is the time to begin taking daily ibuprofen to ward off the disease. news News continued on page 193 bcmj.org Find articles fast, share them easilyWatch for a new website coming in June Professional Cycle DELIVERING MORE AT EVERY STAGE.Updates to the Federal Government's Proposed Tax Changes Understanding the Impact on Your Practice Sweeping federal tax rule changes and proposed changes could signi cantly change how you plan your tax strategies to maximize your practice.

Lee Alumni Centre, UBC193 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 4, may 2018 bcmj.orgnews The importance of expediency in writing the APS An attending physician's statement (APS) is a common requirement for insurance underwriting. Insurers will order an APS as part of standard age and coverage amount requirements or to explore information received from an applicant's telephone interview or paramedical testing. The insurer's underwriting vendor will generally contact a physician's office to verify that the applicant is a patient, then send a request for file information. The vendor will follow up regularly by email, fax, or phone, as long as the APS remains outstanding. After several follow-ups, the insurer will contact the insurance advisor, and perhaps the applicant, to request their intervention with the physician. If an APS remains outstanding, the insur - ance application may be closed. Underwriters can usually expect to wait a minimum of 2 to 3 weeks to receive an APS. Wait times can be influenced by factors such as a physi-cian's patient volume or absence from the office. A delay in receiving the APS can significantly lengthen insurance un-derwriting time. It is not uncommon for a motivated applicant to com-plete the underwriting requirements within 2 to 3 weeks and then spend an additional 6 weeks waiting for the physician to provide the APS. The un-derwriter must then review the APS and may need to request further infor - mation from the original physician or another source, adding another wait period to the process. Longer underwriting can increase expense to the insurance applicant. For instance, if applicants are obtain - ing term life insurance to replace an existing policy that has renewed at higher rates, they must continue pay-ing to maintain that coverage until they are approved for a less-expensive replacement policy. Even a month of delay may mean thousands of dollars in renewal premiums for insurance that could otherwise have been can-celed sooner. Further, a delay in underwriting may impact an applicant's ability to qualify for insurance. When signing for an approved individual insurance policy, the applicant must disclose any personal health changes since the date of the application. Even a seem - ingly benign event may cause the un-derwriter to postpone settlement of coverage and conduct a review. If the applicant has had a routine physical or visited her family doctor with flu symptoms, the underwriter will seek details on any recommended follow-up. Our administrators see multiple cases each year where a member ap-plies for insurance, submits under - writing requirements and is approved for coverage, then advises during pol-icy delivery that the applicant sought treatment for indigestion, chest pain, or a minor injury. Each additional week of underwriting is another week in which the applicant may slip on icy pavement or suffer a heart attack, and the consequences for an insurance ap-plication can range from further de-lay in settling coverage to withdrawal of the insurer's offer. If the member does obtain coverage, it may then be more expensive or have significant restrictions. In a worst-case scenar - io the member may be declined for coverage altogether and will remain uninsured. Efficient underwriting, with all requirements including the APS promptly supplied, reduces the member's risk of becoming uninsur - able while waiting for insurance to be approved. \u2014Laura McLean Client Services Administrator, Doctors of BC Continued from page 191 194 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 4, may 2018 bcmj.orgPrescription, over-the-counter, herbal, homeopathic, and street drugs can have known and un- known side effects that can be drug or individual specific. For individuals who dive for recreation or for work, the unique nature of the hyperbaric en-vironment can add complexity to the side effects experienced. Changes in ambient pressure, temperature, or gas levels can lead to changes in physi-ological mechanisms in the body at depth or on resurfacing. As well, the diver's gas mixture, which might dif-fer from ambient air, could be a factor. You should be aware of these poten-tial effects on your diver patients. In a recent WorkSafeBC case, a commercial diver, who also works in a restaurant, injured his back. Through his rehabilitation process he noted to his general practitioner that he used high levels of marijuana daily for rec-reation and to control his pain. In ad-dition, he was taking synthetic opioids and NSAIDs. His family physician de-clared him fit to return to work without considering the diving environment in declaring fitness. Because he was unfit for diving work, the worker's certificate of medical fitness to dive was revoked by WorkSafeBC until he could demonstrate that he was no lon-ger using marijuana or opioids, and a dive physician assessed him. (A list of Potential effects of drugs on divers This article is the opinion of WorkSafeBC and has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board.worksafebc physicians with training and expertise in dive/hyperbaric medicine can be found on www.worksafebc.com.) Several commonly used over- the-counter medications can impair a diver's ability to interact in their envi-ronment. For example: Antihistamines, particularly older-generation ones, can cause drowsi-ness and reduced secretions that could be compounded under water. Hydration is important to minimize effects of hyperbaric changes in ox-ygen saturation, bubble formation, and nitrogen narcosis. Decongestants can cause vasocon-striction leading to reduced blood flow, which can compound diving injuries. In addition, certain de-congestants, including those that contain pseudoephedrine, can have a \"rebound effect\" resulting in re-verse changes leading to problems on ascent. Others can have adren-aline-like effects that can have ad-verse effects on congestion. Anti-motion-sickness preparations can cause drowsiness. Analgesics and anti-inflammatories can alter hemodynamics. Any medication that affects hy- dration, blood pressure, blood flow, or sedation should be avoided while diving. Consider the active half-life of any medication and, if necessary, explore alternatives. If certain medi-cations are required to control a con-dition, the diver would have to forgo medical certification to dive until the medication is no longer required. Many cardiac, neurological, and psychiatric drugs can have a variety of effects on the surface, which can be compounded at depth. Alcohol and street drugs are strictly prohibited in diving because they can impair judg-ment, cognition, and alertness. Before supporting the use of any medication by a recreation or com-mercial diver, please consider the condition or illness the medication is being used for; side effects that may affect consciousness or decision mak-ing, or may impair physical or mental function; and the complex relation-ship between medications, drugs, the individual, and the individual's envi-ronment. Also, please test the medi-cation on land and under controlled conditions to ensure that no undesired or potentially dangerous side effects occur. Counsel diver patients that us-ing any form of recreational or street drug is contraindicated in diving. For more information If you are ever concerned about a medication or medical condition that may affect a patient working as a di-ver or an individual's ability to dive safely, please consult one of the dive physicians listed on www.worksafe bc.com, a medical advisor in your nearest WorkSafeBC office, or Dr Steve Martin at Steve.Martin@work safebc.com 704-4226. \u2014Steve Martin, MD, CCFP, MScOH, FCBOM, DipSportMed Figure. 195 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 4, may 2018 bcmj.orgcouncil onhealth promotion Water, water everywhere but not a drop to drink! the causes of clean-water insecurity for the Indigenous peoples of Canada. Imagine living in a state of uncer - tainty about whether your drinking water is contaminated, whether this essential source is safe for you or your loved ones to use. This is the reality for many Indigenous commu-nities across Canada. Clean-water security consists of access to sufficient clean water and safe waste-water management. Ac-cess to clean and affordable water should be a basic right for every Ca-nadian, regardless of heritage, skin hue, or address. Why is this access not possible for every Canadian? The effects of clean-water insecurity are myriad and well documented and in-clude infections, mental and physical stress, diabetes, and dental caries. 1 Canada is called a first-world country, but within Canada parity in living standards does not exist. Within this first world, many subpopulations of Indigenous peoples live in a fourth world. 1 This fourth world is defined as a place where subpopulations of a de-veloped country live, in marginalized and substandard living conditions, similar to that of a developing coun-try. Bradford and colleagues state that provincial water regulations, such as they are, do not apply to Indigenous communities, and that the complex interdepartmental regulatory struc-ture hinders safe delivery of clean water, as well as forcing local com-munities to pay 20% of the costs for infrastructure, operations, and main-tenance, including monitoring water safety and assuring availability of trained personnel. 2 It is estimated that people living on reserve are 90 times more likely to lack running water than other Cana-dians. 3 Boyd notes that the \"disparity between water quality on and off re-serve in Canada has been criticized by the UN Committee on Economic and Social and Cultural Rights, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples and the Auditor General of Canada.\" 4 Boyd also comments that there are no national standards for drinking water in Canada; rather, there are guidelines for provinces to apply as they see fit. 4 Because of the Canada Labour Code, Health Canada has installed water treatment systems for their employees (sent to provide health care for local peoples) so that they can have access to safe drinking water in, ironically, Indigenous communities with poor water quality. 4 Poor infrastructure and poverty are seminal causes of clean-water insecurity. Many Indigenous commu-nities are in remote and isolated loca - tions. Sarkar, Hanrahan, and Hudson found that in remote Indigenous com-munities, people often rely on bottled water even though it is expensive and sporadically available, because the potable water dispensing units are often broken, the chlorine needed for processing the water has run out, and This article is the opinion of the Environ- mental Health Committee, a subcommit-tee of Doctors of BC's Council on Health Promotion, and is not necessarily the opin-ion of Doctors of BC.

The health effects of clean water insecurity are another example of the marginalization of Canada's Indigenous peoples. It is time to en-sure everyone in Canada has access to clean, safe drinking water. \u2014Charuka Maheswaran, MD References 1. Sarkar A, Hanrahan M, Hudson A.

ABSTRACT Background: Lymphogranuloma ve- nereum (LGV) is a sexually transmit-ted infection with potentially serious sequelae. We sought to describe the epidemiology of this infection in BC and explore reasons for the doubling of cases seen when data from 2015 were compared with data from 2011 to 2014. Methods: All cases of LGV report- ed in BC from 2011 to 2015 were identified through surveillance and laboratory databases. The charac-teristics of cases, including patient risk factors, and the positivity rate for LGV test results in 2011 to 2014 and 2015 were assessed using de-scriptive statistics. Results: From 2011 to 2015, 125 cases of LGV were reported in BC. The characteristics of cases report-ed in 2011 to 2014 and in 2015 were not significantly different, except for a decrease in cases involving pa-tients self-identifying as Caucasian (62% in 2015 versus 76% in 2011 to 2014).

The positivity rate for LGV test results in 2011 to 2014 was similar to that of 2015 ( P = .78). Conclusions: Lymphogranuloma ve - nereum cases continue to increase in BC, likely in part because of in-creased awareness and testing. Pri-mary care providers should consider this infection in the differential diag-nosis and screen for LGV in high-risk subpopulations.197 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 4, may 2018 bcmj.orgLymphogranuloma venereum in British Columbia, 2011 to 2015: Epidemiology and risk factors Background Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) serovars L1, L2, L2b, and L3. target lymph tissues, often leading to symp-toms more severe than those presented by non-LGV chlamydia. Clinical presentation of LGV may include genital ulcers, inguinal lymphadenop-athy, and hemorrhagic proctitis. Left untreated, LGV may serious sequelae as lymphatic ulcerations, abscesses, or colorectal strictures and fistulae. LGV is endemic in many tropical and subtropical countries, but gener - ally rare in Canada. Local transmis-sion of LGV was first reported in Canada in 2003 and in BC in 2004. Over the past decade, LGV has be-come increasingly common in North America 1-3 and Europe4-7 among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM). These epidem-ics were caused almost exclusively by the L2b serovar. 8,9 Since 2004, there have been 144 LGV cases (probable and confirmed) reported in BC ( Figure ). From 2004 to 2010, 2.7 LGV cases, on aver - age, were reported each year. Dur - ing this time, LGV serovar testing was performed only at the request of a clinician. Since July 2011, rec-tal specimens positive for chlamyd-ia were routinely forwarded to the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) for LGV serovar testing in an effort to increase detection of LGV . In addition, since 2012, clinics operated by the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC), some of which serve MSM patients predominantly, have been routinely screening for chlamydia from pharyngeal and rectal sites when patients report behaviors that may put them at risk for infections at these sites. From 2011 to 2014, there were 83 cases of LGV reported (mean, 21 cases per year). However, in 2015, re-ports of LGV doubled to 42 cases. Given the substantial increase in LGV cases reported, we sought to characterize LGV cases in BC since 2011 when the current LGV serovar testing process was implemented, and explore possible reasons for the in - crease in LGV observed. Methods A confirmed case of LGV is defined as one with a specimen testing posi - tive by DNA sequencing for C. tra-chomatis or L3. In Canada, testing is performed by the NML. 10,11 A prob- able case of LGV is defined as one with a positive nucleic acid amplifi-cation test (NAAT) or culture for C. trachomatis either proctitis, in-guinal or femoral lymphadenopathy, a suspicious lesion, or reports of a sexual partner confirmed or likely to have LGV or with clinical symptoms consistent with LGV and reports of a sexual partner confirmed or likely to have LGV .Case-finding and data collection All genital chlamydia diagnoses, in-cluding LGV , are reportable under the BC Public Health Act and recorded in the provincial STI Information Sys-tem (STI-IS). Since July 2011, rectal specimens that test positive for chla-mydia in BC are routinely forwarded to the NML for LGV serovar testing via the BCCDC Public Health Lab-oratory (PHL), regardless of which laboratory performed the chlamydia testing. All LGV cases diagnosed in BC are followed up by public health nurs-es located at the BCCDC. These nurs-es notify the patient and/or the testing clinician and collect demographic and behavioral information using an enhanced case report form and docu-ment findings in the STI-IS. All confirmed and probable cases of LGV recorded in the STI-IS from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2015 were included in the study. Labora-tory data from the BCCDC PHL dur - ing this period were also reviewed for cases that may have been missed. 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 LGV probable 0 0 7 4 0 0 0 0 0 1 5 2 LGV confirmed 1 2 3 0 0 0 2 22 17 16 22 40 =144 Rectal chlamydia 11 33 47 42 29 54 36 71 274 253 484 587 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 Number of reported rectal chlamydia cases Number of reported LGV cases Routine rectal screening of men who have sex with men (MSM) begins at BCCDC-operated clinics Routine LGV testing of all positive rectal chlamydia cases begins } Figure.

Characteristics of 83 lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) cases reported in British Columbia in 2011 to 2014 and 42 cases reported in 2015.Data analysis Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic, clinical, and behavioral characteristics of LGV cases in two reporting periods: 2011 to 2014 and 2015. Changes in characteristics of LGV cases were assessed using the chi-square test or Fisher exact test for categorical vari-ables and the Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables. LGV positivity rate was calcu- lated as the number of LGV cases (probable and confirmed) over the LGV test volume each year. LGV test volumes were defined as the number of specimens sent to NML for LGV testing in the BCCDC PHL database. Differences in positivity rates were assessed using a two-sided propor - tion z test. Data were analyzed using R-Studio 3.2.1 (RStudio Inc, Boston MA). A P value of < .05 was considered sta-tistically significant. This study was undertaken to un- derstand the provincial epidemiol-ogy of LGV , which falls under the BCCDC public health mandate. Thus, institutional ethics review was not re-quired. Data for this study are under the stewardship of the BCCDC and BCCDC PHL. Results All 125 cases of LGV identified from 2011 to 2015 involved men who have sex with men. Table 1 describes the characteristics of 83 LGV cases re-ported in 2011 to 2014 and 42 cases reported in 2015. Characteristics and risk factors of LGV cases diagnosed in both periods were similar, with the exception of ethnicity. When comparing the two periods, 76% of patients (63 of 83) self-identified as Caucasian in 2011 to 2014, while only 62% of patients (26 of 42) self-identified as Cauca - sian in 2015 ( P = .004). An increas-199 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 4, may 2018 bcmj.orgLymphogranuloma venereum in British Columbia, 2011 to 2015: Epidemiology and risk factors ing proportion of LGV cases involved asymptomatic patients and patients residing outside of Vancouver Coastal Health, although these increases were not statistically significant. Over one-third of cases involving recreational drug use in 2015 (11 of 31 cases) re-ported administration by rectal route. Data for this were not collected previ-ously, however, so a comparison with past years was not possible. The positivity rate for LGV was highest at 51.2% in 2011, the same year routine LGV testing of positive rectal chlamydia samples was imple-mented, then fell to 6.4% in 2012 to 2014 ( Table 2 ). Overall, the positiv- ity rate for LGV in 2011 to 2014 was similar to that of 2015 (P = .78), and the difference between rates for 2012 to 2014 and 2015 was not statistically significant (P = .27). Conclusions In 2015, the number of LGV cases re-ported in BC reached an all-time high of 42. The C. trachomatis serovar identified in all LGV cases was L2b, consistent with LGV cases reported for MSM in other jurisdictions. 1,2,4-7 Characteristics and risk factors for LGV cases reported in 2011 to 2014 were similar when compared to those of cases reported in 2015, with the ex-ception of ethnicity. The proportion of cases reporting an ethnic identity other than Caucasian was higher in 2015 than in 2011 to 2014. This pat-tern mirrors the epidemiology data of both infectious syphilis 12 and HIV13 in BC, which may be the result of increased testing in non-Caucasian populations, a greater proportion of ethnic minorities engaging in higher- risk sexual behaviors, 14,15 or tight- ly interconnected sexual networks of same-ethnicity partners among non-Caucasians. 16 The positivity rate for LGV was highest in 2011 when routine LGV testing of rectal chlamydia samples was implemented, but fell in 2012 when routine screening for rectal STIs commenced. Since 2012, the increase in LGV diagnoses has generally fol - lowed the increase in LGV testing, suggesting that increased screening for rectal STIs may be the reason for the greater number of cases reported. This is consistent with a lack of change in the characteristics of LGV cases in recent years, and an increase in the proportion of asymptomatic cases. The increase in LGV cases among MSM mirrors increases in other STIs in BC. While the reason for these in-creases is not definitively known, increased awareness and regular screening may be increasing detec-tion of STIs. Changes in sexual prac-tices in response to reduced anxiety about HIV transmission and acqui-sition with the availability of highly effective antiretroviral therapy (i.e., HIV treatment optimism) may also be increasing STI transmission. 17,18 A substantial proportion of cases in 2015 involved rectal use of rec-reational drugs. Other jurisdictions have reported similar findings. 19,20 This practice may have a synergis-tic effect on STI transmission, with the presence of drugs in the rectum causing trauma to the rectal muco-sae or condom breakage that can lead to an increased risk of transmitting or acquiring LGV . Sexual practices such as anal enema use, anoreceptive sharing of sex toys, and being fisted may also cause damage to the rectal mucosae. 21,22 Almost two-thirds of patients in LGV cases were co-infected with HIV . This may be due to higher screening rates for LGV (and other STIs), but given the fact that most LGV infec-tions are symptomatic, it is more like - ly that people living with HIV have a higher risk of acquiring LGV . HIV infection has been shown to affect the innate immune response. 23 Also, the practice of serosorting (choosing sexual partners with the same HIV status) may lead to reduced condom use, 24 thus increasing the transmission of other STIs.25 While there is concern that LGV may increase the transmis-sion of HIV , the vast majority of LGV patients co-infected with HIV in our study population had undetectable viral loads, likely making the risk of HIV transmission low. Nevertheless, the presence of mucosal inflamma-tion from concomitant STIs such as LGV may alter the risk of HIV trans-mission, even with virologic sup-pression. 26 Further study is needed to understand LGV trends among HIV-positive MSM, who are dispropor - tionately affected by LGV LGV tests requested LGV cases identified Positivity rate 20112014 totals 994 83 8.4% 2011 43 22 51.2% 2012 257 17 6.4% 2013 217 17 7.8% 2014 477 27 5.7% 2015 totals 529 42 7.9%Table 2.

One limitation is that only individuals diagnosed with LGV were included in the study, which may mean that popu-lations more likely to be screened (e.g., MSM who are \"out\" to their health care providers or people living with HIV) are overrepresented in the LGV case counts. Another limitation is that only rectal chlamydia speci-mens were routinely sent for LGV serovar testing, which may mean that LGV infections from other body sites have been missed. Lastly, the risk fac-tor information collected was subject to recall or social desirability bias and may be inaccurate. Summary As in other jurisdictions, reports of LGV have been increasing in BC over the past decade. In 2015 there were 42 cases reported, twice the mean num - ber of cases in the previous 4 years. However, the characteristics of LGV cases have generally been consistent from 2011 to 2015. The positivity rate has also been stable during this period, suggesting that the increase observed in 2015 is likely due to in-creased awareness and case-finding. While the majority of cases are symptomatic, the proportion of asymptomatic cases has increased re-cently. Primary care providers should offer routine STI screening for sex - ually active patients and consider LGV in the differential diagnosis for patients in a high-risk group, such as MSM living with HIV . More study of recreational drug use, particularly around the time of sex or to enhance sex, is warranted to better understand the potentially synergistic effect of this practice on STI transmission.

There is rarely another time in a patient's life when she is so motivated to achieve a health care goal. This is even more the case with infertility patients. Often by the time a woman reaches my office she has done hours of research, taken supple-ments, consulted her primary care doctor many times, and perhaps even spent thousands of dollars on alterna-tive medicine. During the years of trying for a baby, couples endure an emotional rollercoaster of monthly optimism at ovulation followed by the crash that comes with menses confirming that \"it didn't work.\" Be-cause of the stigma attached to infer - tility, many patients do not share their struggles with friends and family. The Internet offers forums, blogs, and chat groups that can be both helpful and harmful. Unscrupulous websites prey on women at this vulnerable time, of-fering fertility treatments not founded on scientific evidence or even physi-ological plausibility. As doctors we know we cannot change the fact that infertility exists. What we can change is the sense that our patients with in-fertility are alone. Part of helping our patients means simply starting the conversation. The other day, waiting in the op- erating room lounge, I overheard two male surgeons talking about prostate specific antigen testing. One said, \"Yeah, I am a little young to worry about PSA I guess, but I had mine checked last year. You know, might as well.\" The other responded, \"Sure. Makes sense. Mine was high a few years back so . . . had to deal with that.\" It was a normal, casual con-versation, and it struck me that we should strive to make conversations about infertility as commonplace. For example, as doctors we (and our spouses) are particularly susceptible to infertility simply because we take so many years to complete our edu-cation before we start a family. What if we talked about our anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone results the same way my fellow surgeons casually discussed PSA? Seems simple, but it would require a brave candidness to admit that women, doctors, and even wom-en doctors are concerned about their future fertility. I have had the privilege of treat - ing medical colleagues for infertility. Most of them do not tell each other they have gone through treatment. My hope is that we, as physicians, can lead the way in adjusting how we think about infertility\u2014that we can strip away the stigma so that the sin-gle, female surgical resident freezing her eggs does not feel she has to con-ceal the fact that she is thinking about one day, maybe, being a parent. \u2014Caitlin Dunne, MD, FRCSC Co-Director at the Pacific Centre for Reproductive Medicine This article has been peer reviewed.Dr Caitlin Dunne 203 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 4, may 2018 bcmj.orgCaitlin Dunne, MD, FRCsC Infertility: Testing and diagnosis for the community physician The workup for couples who fail to conceive should include confirmation that ovulation is occurring, measurement of hormone levels, hysterosalpingography, and semen analysis. ABSTRACT: Infertility is a condition commonly encountered by family physicians in the community. Timely diagnosis and treatment of infertility can help to mitigate the clinical and emotional consequences for the pa-tient and her partner. Investigations for infertility should be initiated af-ter a year of trying without pregnan-cy, although a community physician would be advised to order testing before a year of trying in four com-mon clinical situations: female age over 35 years, presence of oligomen-orrhea, presence of risk factors for tubal disease, and suspicion of male factor infertility. Standard investiga-tions include ovulation testing such as cycle tracking, use of ovulation predictor kits, basal body tempera-ture charting, and serum progester - one measurement. Ovarian reserve testing should be undertaken to assess the monthly cohort of hor - mone-responsive (pre-antral and antral) follicles. The most common endocrine ovarian test involves mea-suring follicle-stimulating hormone levels on day 3 of the menstrual cy-cle. Additional ovarian reserve tests such as anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone as-say and/or antral follicle count (done by ultrasound in a fertility clinic) can improve sensitivity, specificity, and convenience. Uterine-tubal evalua-tion may be undertaken with hystero-salpingography while hysteroscopy or sonohysterography can be used to further investigate the endometrial cavity as needed. Semen analysis is a fundamental part of the workup because the male factor accounts for approximately 35% of infertility. Infertility investigations should start after 6 months of trying for women over 35 years, and for women over 40 years investigations should be initiated immediately. Consultation with a gynecologist or fertility spe-cialist is covered by provincial health insurance and should be considered for couples with abnormal test re-sults and for couples who fail to con-ceive despite normal test results. Infertility is defined as the failure to achieve a pregnancy after 12 months of unprotected intercourse. It is a prevalent condition that affects about 15% of couples 1 and is com- monly encountered by family physi-cians in the community. The majority of couples conceive within the first 3 months of trying, after which time the chances of pregnancy decline sub-stantially. 1 After 1 year, 85% of cou- ples will have achieved a pregnancy, while after another year only an ad-ditional 5% to 8% of couples will be-come pregnant. 2 Peak fecundability occurs during the fertile window, which encom-passes the 6 days up to and including the day of ovulation. 1 In a study of 221 couples, similar pregnancy rates were achieved with daily intercourse (37%) and intercourse every other day (33%). 1 When frequency of sexual Dr Dunne is a co-director at the Pacific Cen- tre for Reproductive Medicine and a clini-cal associate professor at the University of British Columbia.

This article has been peer reviewed.204 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 4, may 2018 bcmj.orgInfertility: Testing and diagnosis for the community physician intercourse was reduced to weekly, the pregnancy rate fell to 15%.3 Preg- nancies were recorded with sperm as old as 3 days, although the highest chances of conception were seen with intercourse 2 days before ovulation and on the day of ovulation itself. 1,3 Sperm has been found to survive for up to 7 days in the cervical mucus and to retain the ability to fertilize a human egg in vitro after 5 days. 4,5 Following ovulation, an egg may be ready for fertilization within 20 minutes and re-mains usable for 12 to 24 hours. 6 In the fertility clinic, we often tell patients that \"The sperm should be waiting for the egg.\" A period of abstinence lon - ger than 5 to 10 days can have detri-mental effects on sperm motility and concentration. 7 Conversely, normal sperm counts can be maintained even with daily ejaculation. 7 Patients can therefore be advised that intercourse every day or every other day during the late follicular phase will optimize their chances of conceiving. Coital position does not affect the chances of conceiving and women can be safe-ly reassured that they do not need to remain supine for any length of time after intercourse. 8 Sperm have been found within the cervical canal within seconds and in the fallopian tube with-in minutes of ejaculation. 8 Thereafter, the cervix may serve as a reservoir for sperm and fertilization will remain possible in the following days. Detecting ovulation The surest sign of ovulation is a regu-lar menstrual cycle of 21 to 35 days. However, many women choose ad-junctive methods to help them detect ovulation in order to better predict the most fertile time of each month. Numerous devices and products are available for detecting ovulation. However, if a patient finds the process stressful she should be reassured that ovulation tracking is not a require- ment for conceiving and be directed to simply have regular intercourse around mid-cycle. Cycle tracking Cycle tracking, otherwise known as the calendar method, is one of the old-est ways to determine when ovulation is likely to occur. A review of the nor - mal physiology of the corpus luteum (CL) permits a better understanding of this method. The granulosa cells of a dominant follicle\u2014the cells responsible for making estradiol in response to fol-licle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in the follicular phase\u2014undergo several important changes around the time of ovulation. First, they acquire luteiniz - ing hormone (LH) receptors in the late follicular phase to enable them to re-spond to the mid-cycle LH surge and ovulate. Second, they become vascu-larized and therefore capable of trans-forming cholesterol into the principal steroid of the corpus luteum: proges-terone. 6 Peak production of progester - one is achieved approximately 8 days after ovulation; at this moment the CL is one of the most vascular areas of the body. 6 The luteal phase usually lasts 14 days from the time of the LH surge. Therefore, unless the CL receives on-going stimulation in the form of beta- human chorionic gonadotropin from a pregnancy, progesterone production ceases and menses ensues. The calen - dar method assumes that if you count backwards 14 days from the first day of menses you can estimate the date of ovulation in retrospect and use this information to predict future cycles. Some smart phone apps allow a wom-an to record her menses and then use this information to predict her fertile window using a personalized monthly average cycle length. Use of ovulation predictor kits Ovulation predictor kits (OPKs) available from pharmacies and online can be used to detect a high amount of luteinizing hormone in a urine sam - ple. Follicle rupture occurs 34 to 36 hours after the onset of the LH surge at mid-cycle and LH is generally de-tectable in the urine for most of this time. 9 Patients are advised to test mor - ning urine, which is the most concen-trated. The LH surge is responsible for maturation of the oocyte through resumption of meiosis (from prophase I to metaphase II) and for release of the oocyte from the dominant fol-licle. 6 Digital ovulation kits purport to have increased accuracy by adding daily detection of a urinary metabol-ite of estrogen, estrone-3-glucuronide (E3G). Some brands use a smiley face to indicate when E3G levels are high (correlating with a growing dominant follicle) to identify the fertile win-dow leading up to the LH surge and ovulation. The surest sign of ovulation is a regular menstrual cycle of 21 to 35 days.205 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 4, may 2018 bcmj.orgInfertility: Testing and diagnosis for the community physician Basal body temperature charting Basal body temperature (BBT) chart- ing requires that a woman measure her temperature orally each morning before rising and before eating or exercising. The thermometer should be capable of detecting 0.1 \u00b0C in-crements. Daily temperature can be charted on a preprinted graph (many are available online) or using a smart phone app. A biphasic monthly tem-perature pattern indicates ovulation. Typically, a rise in body temperature of 0.5 \u00b0C can be seen after ovula-tion owing to the production of pro-gesterone. Although this rise in BBT means a woman's most fertile days have passed, she can use this infor - mation to predict ovulation in future cycles. Around the time of ovula-tion a woman may also observe egg white cervical mucus that thickens and turns yellow after progesterone is produced. In mid-cycle some wo-men experience mittelschmerz, one- sided lower abdominal pain associ-ated with ovulation. Serum progesterone measurement In the mid-luteal phase (day 21 to 23 of a typical cycle) a serum progester - one level greater than 10 nmol/L is evidence of ovulation. Because pro-gesterone is released in response to pulsatile stimulation by LH, which in turn is influenced by progesterone exposure at the level of the hypothal - amus, values can fluctuate throughout the luteal phase. 6,10 Patients are thus encouraged not to dwell on the abso-lute value of a progesterone measure-ment as long as it is above 10 nmol/L. Investigations for infertility In addition to confirming ovula - tion, the basic workup for infertil-ity includes ovarian reserve testing with a follicle-stimulating hormone test, uterine-tubal evaluation with hysterosalpingography, and semen analysis ( Box). It is generally recommended that investigations for infertility be initi-ated after a year of trying without a pregnancy. There are, however, four common clinical situations where a community physician would be ad - vised to order testing before a year of trying: female age over 35 years, presence of oligomenorrhea, presence of risk factors for tubal disease, and suspicion of male factor infertility. Advancing female age is becom- ing an increasingly prevalent cause of infertility. British Columbia has the highest age of first birth in Canada at 30.5 years versus 30.3 years in On - tario. 11 Over the past 3 decades the in- dustrialized world has seen a dramatic increase in the age of first birth. 12,13 According to Statistics Canada, 2010 marked the first time in our history that more women in their 30s were having children than women in their 20s. 14 In 2011, there were 52.3 babies born per 1000 women age 35 to 39, compared to 45.7 per 1000 women age 20 to 24. 15 In BC, the percentage of live births to women age 35 years and older rose from 11% in 1990 to 23% in 2011, while the percentage of live births to women age 20 to 34 fell from 83% to 74% over the same period. 16 By far the most common reason women reported for not pursu-ing childbearing earlier was lack of a partner. 13 The consequences of delaying childbearing are increasing rates of infertility, embryo aneuploidy, and miscarriage. These are largely at - tributed to aging oocytes with failing meiotic spindles and other ooplasm deficiencies such as mitochondrial dysfunction. Oocyte aging and the re-sulting chromosomal errors explains why miscarriage rates in natural preg-nancies for women younger than age 30 are only 7% to 15% and become marginally higher for women age 30 to 34 at 8% to 21%. By age 35 to 39 the rate is 17% to 28%, and over age 40 the rate is 34% to 52%. 6 According to a computer simulation model, 32 is the maximum age at which couples should start trying to conceive in or - der to have a 90% chance of having a one-child family; for a two-child fam-ily the maximum age is 27; and for a three-child family the maximum age is 23. 17 For women age 35 to 40, fer - tility investigations are indicated af-ter 6 months of trying and for women over 40 years they should be initiated immediately. 1 When to investigate by female age: After 1 year for patients < 35 years. After 6 months for patients 35-40 years. Immediately for patients > 40 years. Clinical factors warranting earlier investigation: Female age > 35 years. Oligomenorrhea. Tubal risk factors. Male infertility risk factors. Most common causes of infertility: Male factor. Ovulatory dysfunction. Tubal/pelvic disease. Advanced female age. standard investigations: Ovulation confirmation (serum progesterone > 10 nmol/L). Cycle day 3 follicle-stimulating hormone (< 7-10 IU/L) + estradiol (< 200 pmol/L). Hysterosalpingography. Semen analysis. ovarian reserve testing with anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMh) assay: AMH reported in pmol/L in Canada and ng/mL in the US. Testing can be done on any day of the cycle. Patients must pay privately ($70).Box. Workup for infertility206 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 4, may 2018 bcmj.orgInfertility: Testing and diagnosis for the community physician Oligomenorrhea warrants early investigation for infertility because it is almost always the result of anovu-lation. If a woman's intermenstrual interval is greater than 35 to 40 days, she may be ovulating infrequently, unpredictably, or not at all. The most common causes of oligomenorrhea are polycystic ovary syndrome, peri-menopause, endocrine disturbances such as thyroid disease, and endo-metrial pathology such as polyps, fi-broids, or hyperplasia. Ovarian reserve testing Ovarian reserve testing aims to esti-mate the number of oocytes a woman has remaining. It is more accurately termed functional ovarian reserve testing because we cannot actually count the number of nongrowing primordial follicles in vivo. 18 There- fore, contemporary ovarian reserve tests assess the monthly cohort of hormone-responsive (pre-antral and antral) follicles to obtain a more ac-curate reflection of the true ovarian reserve. 19,20 Female age is still one of the best predictors of oocyte quality and quantity. A female attains her life-time maximum of oocytes (6 to 7 mil - lion) at around 20 weeks gestational age in utero. 6 By the time she is born that number has already dropped to 1 million and by the time she reaches puberty it is less than half that. 18 Oo- cyte number declines throughout life, dropping more rapidly after age 35 until the menopause threshold, when approximately 1000 oocytes remain. 18 Follicle-stimulating hormone measured on day 3 of the menstrual cycle is the most common endocrine ovarian test. FSH is a gonadotropin produced by the anterior pituitary and it acts on granulosa cells in women to stimulate folliculogenesis and estro-gen production. 6 Elevations in FSH were first described as a marker of ovarian aging over 40 years ago.21 As follicular growth progresses in the early menstrual cycle, production of estradiol and inhibin B results in a negative feedback loop with the pitu-itary, and FSH secretion declines. 6 For this reason, it is customary to avoid falsely reassuring results when mea-suring day 3 FSH by checking that the estradiol level is low (less than 200 pmol/L, approximately) and FSH is not being suppressed. At meno-pause, when the follicular pool is de-pleted, FSH is no longer suppressed by estradiol and inhibin B and there-fore remains indefinitely elevated. When FSH is high (above 20 IU/L) it is a reliable indicator of severely diminished ovarian reserve or peri - menopause. A day 3 FSH level in the normal range (less than 10 to 15 IU/L) is not specific. While some research-ers have reported on FSH thresholds, there is no level of FSH that can be considered definitively reassuring for confirming fertility potential. In a study of 3519 subfertile women, FSH levels above 8 IU/L were asso-ciated with a reduced probability of spontaneous pregnancy in the next 12 months (HR 0.93 per IU/L). 22 In cy - cles of in vitro fertilization (IVF), the live birth rate was maximal when the FSH level was less than 7 IU/L at all ages, and the live birth rate was below 2% when the FSH level was above 18 IU/L. 23 Measuring FSH can be incon- venient for patients since levels must be obtained on cycle days 2 to 4 and are prone to intercycle fluctuations. For this reason, offering additional ovarian reserve tests such as anti- M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) assay or antral follicle count (done by ul-trasound in a fertility clinic) can im-prove sensitivity, specificity, and convenience. Anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone has been called the \"holy grail\" of ovar - ian reserve testing. 24 The hormone was initially described in the 1940s regarding its role in sexual differen-tiation of the male embryo. 25 Spe- cifically, AMH production by testis Sertoli cells in the late first trimester was shown to result in regression of the M\u00fcllerian ducts, while persistence of the Wolffian ducts was shown to re-sult in formation of the internal male structures (epididymis, seminal ves-icles, and vas deferens). 6 In 2002 it was discovered that AMH is closely correlated with the number of oocytes retrieved during an IVF cycle. 26 This led to a huge resurgence of interest in the hormone for assessing women's reproductive physiology. Although AMH is a functional ovarian reserve test, it represents a very accurate as-sessment of a woman's remaining egg number. 20 A blood sample is required for an AMH assay, and in BC this test is not covered by provincial health insur - ance. The cost per assay is typically $70, which is paid to the collecting outpatient laboratory. AMH can be measured on any day of the menstrual cycle because it is only produced by the pre-antral and antral follicles, not the dominant to-cycle variability of AMH does oc-cur, but it is not significant enough to warrant repeated measurement. 28 One study found that AMH was 19% low-er in users of the oral contraceptive pill compared with nonusers. 29 Other patient characteristics and lifestyle factors associated with lower AMH levels include pregnancy, African-American and Hispanic ethnicity, and obesity. 30-32 Interestingly, smoking has been consistently associated with earlier menopause but not with low-er AMH values. 33,34 Research studies have incorporated AMH to improve menopause forecasting but the wide confidence intervals and marked vari-ation between women make it diffi-cult to use clinically. 35 The principal 207 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 4, may 2018 bcmj.orgInfertility: Testing and diagnosis for the community physician utility of AMH is in assessing ovar - ian reserve and predicting a woman's response to controlled ovarian stimu-lation for an IVF cycle. AMH mea-surement has also been used to record ovarian reserve before and after treat - ments known to damage the ovary, such as chemotherapy, radiation, and ovarian surgery. The normal values of AMH are highly age-specific and require care - ful interpretation. It is also impor - tant to note that Canadian labs report AMH in pmol/L, which can be mul-tiplied by 0.14 for conversion to the American units of ng/mL. Although there is no universal definition of high AMH, a level above 21.0 pmol/L (3.0 ng/mL) is considered by many as a risk factor for hyper-response to IVF stimulation. 36 There is no upper level of AMH that is diagnostic of poly-cystic ovary syndrome. AMH levels below 8.0 pmol/L (0.7 to 1.1 ng/mL) are considered low and can be a mark-er for poor egg yield during the IVF process. 36 Uterine-tubal evaluation Estimates suggest that tubal and pel-vic disease cause 35% of infertility. 6 In BC the most readily available test for tubal patency is hysterosalpingog-raphy (HSG), which involves trans-cervical and use of fluoroscopy to visual-ize the internal contour of the uterus and the spill of fluid through the fal-lopian tubes into the pelvis. HSG is generally scheduled in the follicu-lar phase to avoid interfering with a pregnancy. Many facilities require the patient to phone for an appointment when a menstrual period begins and to perform a pregnancy test the day before HSG. For women who do not have a regular menstrual cycle, ex-ogenous progestin can be used to in-duce a withdrawal bleed (e.g., 10 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate PO for 10 days). If the patient has risk fac-tors for postprocedure infection such as hydrosalpinx or previous pelvic inflammatory disease, then antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended (e.g., 100 mg doxycycline PO, twice daily for 3 to 5 days, beginning the day be-fore the procedure ). 37 HSG is a good test for ruling out tubal pathology such as obstruction or hydosalpinx. One meta-analysis reported 65% sensitivity and 83% specificity for tubal obstruction. 38 HSG is less specific for endometrial pathology such as polyps, submucous fibroids, and adhesions. Diagnostic tests in the form of hysteroscopy or sono - hysterography can be done to further investigate the endometrial cavity as needed. When a hysterosalpin-gogram suggests bicornuate uterine configuration, imaging of the uterine corpus must be done to differentiate between septate and bicornuate M\u00fcl-lerian anomalies. This can be done with 3D ultrasound, magnetic reson-ance imaging, or concurrent hystero-scopy with laparoscopy. Some studies have reported an increase in spontan-eous pregnancy rates following HSG with water-based contrast medium, 39 although historically this benefit has been attributed to oil-based contrast HSG. 40 A recent study followed over 1000 infertile women randomly as-signed to undergo HSG with water-based or oil-based contrast. 41 There were significantly more live births in the oil-based group (39% versus 28%, OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.17-1.64). The underlying mechanism for this possible benefit may involve dislodg-ing of mucus plugs and endometrial or immunomodulatory effects. 41 In BC hysterosalpingography is usually performed with water-based contrast. The gold standard for tubal and pel-vic evaluation is laparoscopy with chromopertubation. Because of the inherent risks of surgery and long wait times, however, it is not commonly performed for tubal assessment with-out other indications for surgery. Semen analysis Semen analysis is a fundamental part of the workup because the male factor accounts for at least 35% of infertil-ity. 6 The process of spermatogenesis takes approximately 70 days and con-tinues throughout a man's lifetime, al-lowing many men to maintain fertility in perpetuity. 6 Once a spermatozoon is deposited in the vagina, it must sep-arate itself from the seminal fluid (a product of the seminal vesicles and prostate gland) and swim through the cervical mucus and endometrial cav-ity to wait for the oocyte in the fallop-ian tube. A complex set of activities in the sperm is required for successful fertilization, including capacitation and the acrosome reaction, which al-low for penetration of the cumulus oophorus and zona pellucida (egg shell). 6 Once the sperm head fuses with the oolemma it will undergo nuclear decondensation to form the male pronucleus and eventually fuse with the female pronucleus to create an embryo. 6 An optimal sample for semen analysis is obtained after 2 to 5 days of abstinence and processed for analysis after 15 to 30 minutes of observed liquefaction. The nor - mal values for semen parameters in the current World Health Organiza-tion (WHO) laboratory manual (5th edition) were obtained from a retro-spective examination of fertile men whose partners conceived within 12 months. 42 The lowest fifth percentile was used as a cutoff. A semen analysis uses one-sided lower limits for refer - ence: volume (1.5 mL), concentration (15 M/mL), total sperm count (39 M), total motility (40%), progressive mo-tility (32%), vitality (58%), and mor - phology (4%). 43 For fertility, the chief 208 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 4, may 2018 bcmj.orgInfertility: Testing and diagnosis for the community physician prognostic parameters are sperm con- centration and motility, with mor - phology being of lesser importance. Sperm concentration can vary sub-stantially from sample to sample in both fertile and infertile men. 42 When the concentration is lower than 15 M/mL fertility is reduced, while increas-es above this level are not consistent - ly associated with better pregnancy rates. 42 Sperm motility can be affect - ed by many factors, including dura-tion of abstinence, age, health status, length of time to processing, and ex-posure to heat or toxins. 42 An abnor - mal test result warrants repeat testing, allowing a break of at least 2 to 3 months for any intervention aimed at improving sperm quality. Assessing morphology involves examination of at least 200 sperm under 400x or 1000x magnification to consider the head, mid-piece, and tail according to the Kruger criteria. 42 The first edition of the WHO laboratory manual re-quired 80.5% normal-shaped sperm; over subsequent editions this was re-duced to 50.0% (2nd edition), 30.0% (3rd edition), and 15.0% (4th edition). It is important when counseling pa-tients to reassure them that even 0% normal sperm morphology does not preclude a pregnancy. 44 Summary Infertility is a prevalent condition that affects about 15% of couples. In BC women are delaying childbear - ing longer than anywhere else in the country. This makes our patient popu-lation particularly susceptible to age-related infertility. For women over 35 years, infertility investigations should be initiated after 6 months of trying to conceive, and for women over 40 years, investigations should be initiated immediately. The basic workup for infertility includes con-firmation of ovulation, measurement of follicle-stimulating hormone level, hysterosalpingography, and semen analysis. Measurement of day 3 FSH should be ordered in conjunction with measurement of estradiol to confirm appropriate timing. Physicians should be aware that because FSH is a late marker of diminished ovarian reserve, there is no level of FSH considered reassuring. AMH is an accurate and convenient test, but interpretation is highly age-specific. HSG is a useful test to rule out tubal obstruction; how-ever, any uterine abnormality should be investigated further with hyst-eroscopy with laparoscopy or sono-hysterography. Semen analysis is a key component of the basic infertil-ity workup, with sperm concentration being the most important predictor for fertility. Consultation with a gynecol - ogist or fertility specialist is covered by provincial health insurance and should be considered for couples with abnormal test results and for couples who fail to conceive despite normal test results .

ABSTRACT: The clinical presenta- tion of polycystic ovary syndrome is widely variable, en-compassing oligomenorrhea, infer - tility, obesity, hirsutism, endometrial cancer, and diabetes. Community physicians caring for reproductive-age women will invariably encounter this reproductive and metabolic dis-order resulting from ovarian hyper - androgenism and insulin resistance. While community physicians should be aware of the diagnostic criteria for polycystic ovary syndrome, it is more important to have a thorough understanding of symptom manage-ment and prevention of long-term complications. Historically, clo-miphene citrate has been used to address infertility by inducing ovu-lation, with more recent evidence supporting the use of letrozole as first-line therapy for ovulation induc-tion. These and other mainstay treat-ments may be needed to address anovulation, obesity, and hirsutism. Patients should also be monitored for endometrial cancer and type 2 diabetes.Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent repro-ductive and metabolic disorder with variable phenotypes and an un der- lying pathophysiology that is still not completely understood. While the earliest description of the polycystic ovary dates back to the 17th century, 1 the characterization of the present-day disorder known as PCOS was first detailed by Irving Stein and Michael Leventhal in 1935. 2 In a seminal pa- per, the two prominent gynecologists described a case series of seven wom-en with enlarged ovaries associated with oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, sterility, and clinical hyperandrogen-ism. Histopathologic determination of the disorder was undertaken by wedge biopsy of the ovaries. The surgical procedure that led to characterization of the disorder also serendipitously led to the first therapeutic intervention for infertile women with PCOS. Five of the seven women subsequently conceived after normalization of their menstrual cycles. One woman who did not conceive was affected by male factor infertility and the other woman was lost to follow-up. As a result, Stein-Leventhal syn-drome was the term used for more than 50 years for the heterogeneous clinical features of the disorder now known as polycystic ovary syndrome. In 1990 the first international defini-tion of PCOS was developed, which has since been revised by various professional bodies. The lack of con-sensus in the definition of PCOS fur - ther highlights the uncertainty about the pathophysiology of the disorder. However, for the practising physician a thorough understanding of symptom management and prevention of long-term complications is more important than an understanding of the different diagnostic criteria for PCOS. Pathophysiology The abnormal findings in PCOS are a result of ovarian hyperandrogenism 3 Dr Havelock is a co-director of the Pacific Centre for Reproductive Medicine and a clinical assistant professor in the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infer - tility at the University of British Columbia. He is also the former program director for the subspecialty residency in Gynecologic Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at UBC. This article has been peer reviewed.211 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 4, may 2018 bcmj.orgPolycystic ovary syndrome and insulin resistance.4 Evidence sug- gests that the ovarian hyperandrogen- ism in PCOS is a result of primary ovarian dysfunction and is second-ary to disordered gonadotropin activ - ity. While not included in diagnostic criteria for PCOS, the elevated level of serum luteinizing hormone (LH) in affected patients due to inappro - priate secretion has long been recog-nized. 5 LH is the ligand for the LH receptor on the ovarian theca cells responsible for ovarian androgen pro-duction. Genome-wide association studies conducted on hyperandro-genic subjects with PCOS revealed genome-wide significance for a locus mapping to chr 11p14.1 in the region of the hormone beta polypeptide (FSHB). 6 This sin- gle-nucleotide polymorphism was associated with LH levels that result in the elevated LH:FSH ratios often seen in PCOS, providing further sup-port for the hypothesis that dysregu-lated gonadotropin secretion in PCOS leads to secondary hyperandrogen-ism. This gonadotropin imbalance favors an exaggerated intraovarian androgen environment under the in-fluence of LH, and impaired follicu-logenesis resulting in anovulation due to a relative FSH deficiency. Evidence also suggests that the ovarian hyperandrogenism seen in PCOS is primary, with abnormal ovarian steroidogenesis through over - expression of the CYP17 gene being responsible for androgen biosynthe-sis, as well as increased expression of the LH receptor, which would po-tentially render the ovarian theca cells more sensitive to LH stimulation. 7,8 The ovarian hyperandrogenism ap-pears to play a role in the appearance of the polycystic ovary on ultrasound and the follicular arrest and anovula-tion that is prevalent in PCOS. The ovarian phenotype may result from either endogenous or exogenous an -drogens, as demonstrated in the simi-lar ultraosonographic findings and gene expression profile studies on the ovaries of women with PCOS and the ovaries of androgen-treated female-to-male transgender individuals. 9 Evidence for the role of insulin resistance in the pathophysiology of PCOS and ovarian hyperandrogen-ism is demonstrated indirectly by the findings of hyperandrogenism in female subjects with type A insulin resistance syndrome, a disorder char - acterized by a mutation in the insulin receptor gene. 10 Insulin contributes to the biochemical and clinical hyperan-drogenism by directly enhancing the-ca cell ovarian androgen production in concert with LH, 4 and indirectly by lowering sex hormone-binding globulin, the carrier protein respon-sible for reducing circulating free testosterone levels. 11 The high preva- lence of impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes in women with PCOS has led researchers to consider the role of insulin sensitizers in treat-ing PCOS. Diagnostic criteria Three sets of diagnostic criteria for polycystic ovary syndrome are used commonly ( Table 1 ). All require the exclusion of other known disorders. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) conference on PCOS in 1990 led to the first internationally accept - ed diagnostic criteria. The two criteria (clinical and/or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism and menstrual dysfunction) were based on expert opinion solicited through a question-naire. In 2003 the Rotterdam criteria developed by the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embry-ology and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ESHRE/ASRM) allowed for the inclusion of polycystic-appearing ovaries on ul-trasound. This was defined as 12 or more follicles measuring 2 to 9 mm in at least one ovary, or an ovarian volume greater than 10 mL in the absence of a dominant follicle. The ESHRE/ASRM diagnostic guidelines only required meeting two of three criteria (clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, oligomenorrhea and/or anovulation, and polycystic ovaries). 12 Most recently, the experts contributing to the Androgen Excess Society (AES) diagnostic guidelines required meeting two criteria (clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogen-ism and either ovarian dysfunction or polycystic ovaries). 13 National Institutes of health criteria (1990) Must meet both criteriaEuropean society for human Reproduction and Embryology and American society for Reproductive Medicine Rotterdam criteria (2003) Must meet two of three criteriaAndrogen Excess society criteria (2006) Must meet both criteria Clinical and/or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenismClinical and/or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenismClinical and/or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism Menstrual dysfunction Oligoovulation or anovulation Ovarian dysfunction or polycystic ovaries Polycystic ovaries Exclusion of other known disorders is required as well.Exclusion of other known disorders is required as well.Exclusion of other known disorders is required as well.Table 1. Diagnostic criteria for polycystic ovary syndrome.212 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 4, may 2018 bcmj.orgPolycystic ovary syndrome The Rotterdam criteria are the most widely used for PCOS diagnosis, and like the more liberal AES criteria they allow for different phenotypes of the disorder. Prevalence estimates for PCOS obtained using the Rotter - dam and AES criteria (12% to 18%) were up to twice that obtained using the NIH criteria (9%). 14 NIH-defined PCOS is the most common pheno-type, and women with this phenotype are most at risk of developing repro-ductive and metabolic abnormalities, specifically type 2 diabetes. Women with the Rotterdam PCOS phenotype without hyperandrogenism are least at risk of reproductive and metabolic abnormalities. 15 Evaluation As PCOS is ultimately a diagnosis of exclusion, other endocrinopathies that have clinical features similar to those of PCOS must be considered. If ovulatory dysfunction exists, or - dering tests to rule out causes such as thyroid dysfunction and hyperprolac-tinemia (e.g., thyroid-stimulating hor - mone, prolactin assay) is imperative. Considering the possibility of other more serious causes of androgen ex - cess, such as nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (confirmed with an elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone level) and androgen-producing tumors (confirmed with total testosterone levels twofold above upper-normal), is also recommended. In the presence of oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, measurement of serum FSH and es-tradiol may be warranted to rule out insufficiency or hypogonado-tropic hypogonadism (hypogonadism of hypothalamic or pituitary origin). The most common clinical feature of hyperandrogenism is hirsutism: the growth of excessive hair in a male-type pattern caused by the conversion of vellus hair to terminal hair under androgen effect on the pilosebacous unit. Hirsutism is most commonly as-sessed using the modified Ferriman-Gallwey scale to quantify the amount of hair growth on various androgen-dependent body areas. However, race and ethnicity play a significant part in hirsutism. 16 Additionally, the Ferriman-Gallwey scoring system can be somewhat impractical in ev-eryday clinical practice, and will be affected by a patient's recent waxing, shaving, or other depilation. Practi - cally, hirsutism remains largely a self-reported symptom. In the absence of hirsutism, acne may be considered a clinical marker of hyperandrogenism. A strict definition of biochemical hyperandrogenism in PCOS does not exist. A free testosterone index and a free androgen index are thought to be the most sensitive markers of bio-chemical hypernadrogenemia by the authors of the Rotterdam criteria. 12 However, the assay methods are vari-able and have significant limitations. Total testosterone is not a sensitive marker of androgen excess, but mea - surement may be useful if an andro-gen-secreting neoplasm is suspected. Irregular or absent menstrual cy- cles are the most common clinical finding of PCOS and are usually iden-tified during history taking. 13 Menstru- al cycle intervals longer than 35 days are often anovulatory. If menstrual cycles are absent because of ovarian insufficiency this will be indicated by a finding of significantly elevated FSH levels. In PCOS, which is character - ized by euestrogenic chronic anovula-tion, menstrual withdrawal bleeding can typically be induced by a 5-day to10-day course of progesterone or progestin. This provides further sup-port for anovulation being secondary to PCOS and not being the result of ovarian insufficiency or hypogonado-tropic hypogonadism. In women with less severe menstrual disturbance, se-rum progesterone can be measured in the mid-luteal phase (day 21 to 23) of the menstrual cycle. If ovulation has occurred, the level will be 10 nmol/L or higher. A diagnosis of PCOS rarely re - quires the use of ultrasound to con-firm polycystic-appearing ovaries. As symptom management is the focus in PCOS, ultrasound adds little clinical value. However, ultrasound may be warranted for investigating a pelvic mass, infertility, or pelvic pain. It is important, when possible, that the ul-trasound be performed with the use of an endovaginal ultrasound probe. Furthermore, obtaining an antral follicle count in each ovary (all fol-licles 2 to 9 mm) is important since the ultrasound diagnostic criteria for PCOS were established by repro-ductive endocrinologists rather than radiologists. Finally, there is a signifi-cant overlap between the diagnoses of polycystic-appearing ovaries and normal ovaries, with 30% to 50% of women younger than 30 having 12 or more follicles per ovary. 17 This indi - cates that a polycystic-appearing ova-ry is not pathognomonic of PCOS. Management In addition to infertility caused by an-ovulation, women with PCOS are at risk for obesity, hirsutism, endometrial cancer, and type 2 diabetes and should be managed accordingly ( Box). Anovulation While anovulation can lead to long-term health consequences such as endometrial cancer and hyperplasia, most PCOS patients will present in-itially with infertility. It is reasonable to begin by ruling out male factor infertility with semen analysis and to complete fallopian tube assessment if the patient has risk factors for tubal factor infertility (prior ectopic preg-nancy or gynecologic surgery, rup-tured appendix, history of recurrent or 213 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 4, may 2018 bcmj.orgPolycystic ovary syndrome severe pelvic inflammatory disease). Ovulation induction is the simplest and least expensive infertility therapy. For years, clomiphene, a selec- tive estrogen receptor modulator first shown to induce ovulation in 1961, has been the mainstay of ovulation induction for PCOS. More recently, letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, has been used off-label for ovulation in-duction, as first described in 2001. 18 A large, multicentre RCT comparing both medications in PCOS patients with anovulatory infertility demon-strated superior live birth rates in the letrozole arm (27.5%) compared with the clomiphene arm (19.1%), with similar twin pregnancy rates (3.9% vs 6.9%). 19 While letrozole for ovula- tion induction in the setting of PCOS still remains off-label use, the recent discontinuation of clomiphene pro-duction in Canada, along with the superior clinical outcomes with le-trozole, has made this the first-line therapy for women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility. Typically, therapy with either agent is initiated on cycle day 3 of a spontaneous or progestin-induced menstrual bleed ( Table 2 ). As insulin resistance is a common feature of PCOS, the use of insulin sensitizing agents, particularly metfor - min, for treatment of anovulatory in - fertility is physiologically reasonable. Early studies demonstrated ovulation rates of up to 90% in women treated with metformin and clomiphene, 20 and ovulation rates of 75% in women who remained anovulatory on clomiphene single-agent therapy. 21 However, the Pregnancy in Ovary (PPCOS I) trial 22 comparing metfor - min plus clomiphene found metfor - min alone was inferior to clomiphene alone and to metformin plus clomi - phene. Metformin plus clomiphene outperformed clomiphene alone in ovulation rate, but with pregnancy and live birth rates that were similar. Thus, there appears to be no role for metformin as a single agent for ovula-tion induction in PCOS, and a limited role for metformin as adjuvant treat-ment for ovulation induction. Obesity Obesity is prevalent in 50% to 80% of women with PCOS. 15 Both the PP- COS I trial22 and the PPCOS II trial23 comparing letrozole and clomiphene demonstrated live birth rates approxi-mately twofold higher for women with a BMI less than 30 kg/m 2 than for women with a BMI greater than 35 kg/m 2 (PPCOS I) and 39 kg/m2 (PPCOS II). While both studies defin-itively demonstrated that a high BMI has an adverse effect on response to ovulation induction with oral agents, evidence of a positive effect for weight loss in women with infertility second-ary to anovulation was lacking until recently. Now a trial of obese women with anovulatory infertility who were randomly assigned to either a life-style intervention (exercise and diet for 6 months) or no lifestyle interven-tion has found a significant improve-ment in live birth rates for women in the lifestyle intervention group (number needed to treat with lifestyle intervention to result in 1 additional spontaneous live birth without fertil - ity therapy = 6). 24 Subjects in the life - style intervention group lost 4.4 kg on average during the 6-month pre - fertility treatment intervention.25 Diet and exercise as first-line therapy for Table 2.

In addition to infertility caused by anovulation, women with PCOS are at risk for obesity, hirsutism, endometrial cancer, and type 2 diabetes. Off-label use of letrozole for ovulation induction (2.5 mg, 5.0 mg, and 7.5 mg daily, from cycle days 3-7 or 5-9) has been found to be safe and effective. Clomiphene citrate, the drug commonly used in the past for ovulation induction, may be difficult to obtain because the only manufacturer in Canada has stopped production. Oral contraceptive use remains the first-line therapy for hirsutism and has demonstrated a reduction in risk of endometrial cancer. Metformin use and lifestyle interventions have been found to reduce risks associated with type 2 diabetes. 214 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 4, may 2018 bcmj.orgPolycystic ovary syndrome anovulatory infertility in obese wo- men with PCOS is supported by both common sense and well-designed clinical research. Hirsutism Hirsutism is the result of elevated cir - culating free testosterone acting on the pilosebaceous unit to convert vellus hair to terminal hair. Removal of un-wanted hairs by electrolysis or mech-anical depilation will be a temporary solution if the underlying endocrine disorder is not treated. The androgen effect responsible for hirsutism can potentially be reduced by decreas-ing androgen production, increasing androgen-binding capacity to reduce circulating levels, or reducing andro-gen action at the androgen receptor. However, individuals with hirsutism must be counseled to be patient, as response to endocrine therapy takes at least 3 to 6 months in concordance with the hair growth cycle. The oral contraceptive pill (OCP) remains the first-line therapy for hir - sutism because of its effect on andro-gen production. 26 First, the estrogen component of the OCP increases sex hormone-binding globulin levels, re-sulting in greater androgen-binding capacity, and reducing circulating free testosterone levels. Second, the progestin component suppresses pi-tuitary LH production, reducing the stimulation of theca synthesis under LH stimula cyproterone acetate function as androgen receptor antago-nists, and have a theoretical advantage over other progestins. OCP use of-fers the additional benefit of reducing acne, if present, and provides protec - tion against endometrial cancer and menstrual cycle irregularity. Women with hirsutism who do not respond adequately to OCP treatment may benefit from other anti-androgen therapies such as spironolactone or finasteride. Spironolactone is a min-eralocorticoid antagonist that also functions as a weak androgen recep - tor antagonist. As well, spironolac-tone reduces the activity of 5-alpha reductase (the enzyme responsible for converting testosterone to the more potent dihydrotestosterone), and re-duces testosterone biosynthesis. Daily doses of spironolactone (100 mg) for at least 6 months have been shown to reduce hirsutism. 27 Finas - teride, a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, has a theoretical role in management of hirsutism, but clinical trial results have been inconsistent. 28 When OCP use alone is ineffective, it is prudent to use anti-androgen therapies in con-junction with OCP due to the poten-tial teratogenic effects of these agents in the case of inadvertent pregnancy. Endometrial cancer Endometrial cancer prevalence is documented to be significantly higher (by 2.7-fold) in women with PCOS. 29 However, it is difficult to determine whether PCOS is an independent risk factor for endometrial cancer because many of the common presenting fea-tures of PCOS (obesity, infertility, diabetes, unopposed estrogen/irregu-lar menstrual cycles) are independent risk factors for endometrial cancer. Regardless, heightened awareness and monitoring for endometrial can-cer in women with PCOS is war - ranted, and risk-reduction strategies should be undertaken. While weight loss and exercise are recommended for managing PCOS in obese women, evidence for these as effective ther - apy for protection against endomet-rial cancer is lacking. Oral contraceptive use has consis- tently been found to reduce risk of en-dometrial cancer. OCP use appears to provide a risk reduction of approxi-mately 50%, and the protective effect seems to last up to 20 years after stop-ping OCP use. 30 Additionally, rela- tive reduction of endometrial cancer risk seems to be approximately two-fold lower in women who have used the OCP for 12 years compared with women using it for 4 years. 31 Some women with PCOS and ir - regular menstrual cycles and anovula-tion resulting in unopposed estrogen may not tolerate OCP therapy, or OCP use may be contraindicated. Cy-clic progesterone therapy (e.g., 200 mg Prometrium PO daily for 10 to As PCOS is ultimately a diagnosis of exclusion, other endocrinopathies that have clinical features similar to those of PCOS must be considered. 215 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 4, may 2018 bcmj.orgPolycystic ovary syndrome 14 days per month, 5 to 10 mg me- droxyprogesterone PO daily for 10 to 14 days per month) may be a reason-able option for inducing cyclic menses and unopposed estrogen. Alterna-tively, a progestin-releasing intrauter - ine contraceptive device may provide similar, noncontraceptive benefit. 32 While all of these therapies represent off-label use, they are generally ac-cepted as appropriate therapy in the circumstances. Type 2 diabetes When controlling for other risk fac - tors, PCOS remains an independent risk factor for developing impaired glucose tolerance (RR 2.5) and type 2 diabetes (RR 4.0). 33 Although manage- ment of diabetes is beyond the scope of this article, it is possible to recommend exercise and weight loss to reduce the risk of progression from impaired glu-cose tolerance to diabetes. 34 Metformin use may also be considered, given that it is known to have a modest effect de-spite being less effective than lifestyle intervention in reducing diabetes risk. Patients with PCOS should be mon-itored for diabetes if they have a BMI greater than 30 kg/m 2 (or greater than 25 kg/m2 for Asian patients) or have a family history of diabetes, acanthosis nigricans, or hyperandrogenism with anovulation. 29 Summary Polycystic ovary syndrome remains a prevalent reproductive and metabolic disorder with variable phenotypes and an underlying pathophysiology that is not completely understood. Mak-ing a diagnosis of PCOS is beneficial but not essential. Therapy remains focused on managing symptoms (in - fertility caused by anovulation, obes-ity, hirsutism) and reducing long-term health risks (endometrial cancer, type 2 diabetes) .

Roberts, MD Fertility preservation for young cancer patients Subfertility and gonadal failure are possible after childhood exposure to chemotherapy, making future reproductive function a growing survivorship issue that must be addressed. ABSTRACT: Recent advances in cryopreservation are providing ef-fective fertility preservation op - tions for young Canadians requiring chemotherapy for cancer. Both fe-male and male patients can opt to freeze gametes before undergoing treatment. Embryo, oocyte, and ovarian tissue freezing are possible for females, and sperm freezing is possible for males. The decision to proceed with fertility preservation is made by taking into account the patient's age, diagnosis, oncology treatment plan, fertility status, and personal/social situation. Manage-ment should include surveillance of ovarian reserve, counseling on fertil-ity and sexual health, and provision of egg and embryo banking in cas-es where the patient's reproductive lifespan is likely to be significantly reduced. Barriers to fertility preser - vation include a lack of awareness and the high cost of these services. A multidisciplinary approach to care, education of oncology professionals and patients on issues related to re-production, and better funding can help ensure that cancer patients re-ceive timely counseling and appro-priate fertility preservation services. Modern chemotherapeutic protocols are highly effec-tive at destroying malignant cells, but also damage ovaries and testicles in the process, leading to infertility in a sizable percentage of patients. This is a challenging survi-vorship issue faced by fertility spe-cialists and cancer specialists alike. Most young cancer survivors desire future pregnancy, and the psycho-logical impact of infertility can be greater than the effects of the cancer itself, with overt PTSD seen in some cases. 1 Fertility preservation treat- ments can increase the likelihood of future pregnancy. More importantly, they can also provide patients with hope and a positive distraction dur - ing a very negative time in their lives. Young patients often have a limited understanding of their own reproduc-tion and what options exist through modern assisted reproductive tech-nology (ART), and are unlikely to seek advice on fertility preservation; therefore, referral to a fertility spe-cialist with the ability to discuss and deliver these services is critical. Ovarian reserve testing Ovarian reserve (the pool of primor - dial follicles) and reproductive poten-tial both decline as women age. 2 The reduction in natural fertility with age is mirrored by the lower pregnancy rates with medical fertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization (IVF). Chemotherapeutic agents acceler - ate the age-related loss of primordial follicles through an increase in re-cruitment of ovarian follicles (burn - out theory), apoptosis of supporting granulosa cells, and disappearance of eggs. 3,4 The toxicity of chemothera- peutic treatments varies according to the specific agents administered, dose, and protocol, and the reproduct-ive potential of the patient at the time of treatment. 5-8 Primordial follicles are not mitotically active, so they are still sensitive to alkylating agents (a mainstay of most combination chemotherapy), which are cell cycle-independent drugs that can cause dir - ect DNA damage.

He is past-president of the Canadian Fertility and Andrology Society. He also serves as president of the board for Fertile Future, a charitable organization dedicated to reduc-ing costs for fertility preservation services for those with cancer. This article has been peer reviewed.218 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 4, may 2018 bcmj.orgFertility preservation for young cancer patients The clinical measure of reproduc- tive toxicity has traditionally been ovarian failure rates, which range from less than 20% to over 80%. Re-gardless of the type of chemothera-peutic agent administered, at least a portion of the ovarian reserve will be lost, even if this is not immediately apparent clinically. 9,10 Ovarian failure occurs when a woman's follicle popu- lation drops to a point where hormone fluxes are inadequate to maintain a normal menstrual cycle. In terms of the capacity to conceive with her own eggs, a patient is rendered sterile at this point. Normal menstrual function can be sustained with less than 10% of ovarian mass, making ovarian failure a very late measure of reduced fertil - ity. Even if a patient is deemed to be at minimal risk for premature ovarian failure, it is safe to assume that her reproductive lifespan will be short-er despite the resumption of regular menstrual cycles. 4,11-15 A survey of 2532 cancer survivors between the ages of 18 and 40 showed that infer - tility rates were higher than rates of acute ovarian failure, highlighting the fact that the impact on fertility can be underestimated if the focus is simply on menstrual disruption. 10 For breast cancer, which is the most common cancer in reproductive-age women, chemotherapy likely advances repro-ductive age by at least 10 years. The decision to proceed with fer - tility preservation treatments requires taking into account the patient's age, diagnosis, oncology treatment plan, fertility status, and personal/social situation. Even if not undergoing go- nadotoxic treatments, all reproduc-tive-age women now have the option to improve on the prospects of future pregnancy through ART, and the de-cision-making process is largely the same, albeit less urgent. In the case of breast cancer, plans must account for the 2-year period of recurrence observation following completion of chemotherapy and the lengthy delays possible when adjuvant hor - mone therapies are employed. It is important that the oncology team be consulted prior to initiating fertility preservation treatment. Careful coor - dination of the fertility preservation protocol is required to allow for the timely delivery of the cancer treat-ment, with a clear understanding that cure takes precedence. Ovarian reserve testing is impor -tant for tailoring a woman's ovarian stimulation protocol and for provid-ing a reasonable estimate of her like - lihood of pregnancy in the future. All measures of ovarian reserve are af-fected by chemotherapy, and patients with a history of chemotherapy expo-sure appear to have a lower potential for pregnancy. 16 A cycle day 3 follicle- stimulating hormone serum level has been the standard way to evaluate ovarian reserve for many years, with anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) level now proving to be a better predictor of reproductive outcomes and a more convenient option, as it can be per - formed at any time in the menstrual cycle. Unfortunately, AMH testing is not an insured service in BC, cost-ing approximately $70. In combina-tion with patient age, the AMH level is also useful for quantifying the ef-fects of chemotherapy in individuals, for predicting response to ovarian stimulation, live birth rates, and for ovarian reserve surveillance. 17,18 A transvaginal pelvic ultrasound with antral follicle count is an essential part of the basic fertility assessment of these patients, and is as predic - tive as the AMH level for ovarian re-sponse to gonadotropins. 19 In vitro fertilization and embryo freezing The mainstay of fertility preservation in female patients is the freezing of egg and embryos generated through the IVF process. 20,21 It is important to minimize any delay of cancer treat-ments and to maximize the number of eggs without causing undue discom - fort for the patient or complications such as ovarian hyperstimulation syn-drome or ovarian torsion. With con-current use of aromatase inhibitors, gonadotropins can be administered to maximize embryo yield while mini - mizing the normally elevated estro-gen levels encountered during these For breast cancer, the most common cancer in reproductive-age women, chemotherapy likely advances reproductive age by at least 10 years.219 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 4, may 2018 bcmj.orgFertility preservation for young cancer patients treatments, which can be particularly important for the breast cancer pa-tient. IVF protocols are principally defined by the methods used to block the surge of luteinizing hormone. In-hibiting the ovulatory process allows for the precise timing of the egg re - trieval procedure and prevents pre - mature luteinization of the uterus to allow for transfer of fresh embryos. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist protocols provide the most flexibility for ovarian stimula-tion. These treatment cycles tend to be shorter, require less gonadotropin medication (which reduces costs), and can virtually eliminate the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome when a gonadotropin-releasing hor - mone agonist (GnRHa) is adminis-tered to trigger final maturation of eggs for harvest. 22 The ultimate goal is to maximize the number of eggs retrieved, while minimizing any risks and delay of cancer treatments. Cryopreservation of embryos has remained the principal fertility pres-ervation treatment for decades. It is employed by all IVF clinics for the banking of supernumerary embryos generated through IVF and for situ-ations when pregnancy is ill-advised for medical reasons or is being delayed for social reasons. The likelihood of future pregnancy depends on the pa - tient's age, the number of embryos obtained, and the number of IVF cy-cles performed. Of great importance is the growing body of evidence that demonstrates higher pregnancy rates and better perinatal outcomes when a frozen embryo transfer rather than a fresh embryo transfer is used. 18,23-27 A recent exciting advance in the tech-nology is the use of embryo biopsy techniques for choosing embryos for use, by screening out aneuploidy (comprehensive chromosomal screen-ing) and single gene defects (preim - plantation genetic diagnosis). 28 Oocyte and ovarian tissue freezing For women wanting reproductive autonomy, or those without a male partner, oocyte cryopreservation has become the standard method of preserving fertility. Historically, the technique has been beset by lower pregnancy rates compared with em - bryo cryopreservation, but improve - ments have been seen with recent advances in vitrification, the flash-freezing technology now being of-fered by most Canadian IVF clinics. The poor outcomes of the past were related to several technical challen-ges inherent in freezing and thawing of oocytes, the largest human cells. Mature (meiosis II) eggs provide the best chance for pregnancy, but have several characteristics that make them susceptible to cryodamage, including large size (low surface area to volume ratio) and high water content, which makes the egg vulnerable to ice crys-tal formation, rupture, and limited permeability to cryoprotectant solu-tions. Recent studies have found pregnancy rates with frozen eggs ap-proaching those of fresh. 29,30 Despite the potential obstacles, clinical and neonatal outcomes to date attest to the safety of this technology, and it is now recognized by the Canadian Fertility and Andrology Society as a standard of care. 31 Reports of reduced amenorrhea rates in young women using adjuvant gonadotropin-releasing hormone ag-onists throughout chemotherapy have prompted research into the protective properties of GnRHa for the ovary. Proposed mechanisms of action in- clude hypogonadotropism-induced ovarian quiescence, reduction of ovarian blood flow, and agonistic ef-fects on ovarian receptors for gonad-otropin-releasing hormone. Although not presently endorsed by the most recent guideline of the American So-ciety of Clinical Oncology (2013) as a standard method of fertility preser - vation, 7 two large RCTs suggest that a reduction in the risk of premature menopause is approximately 50% in patients undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer. 32,33 GnRHa adminis- tration prior to and during chemother - apy is presently used widely in BC. Since the first experiments with ovarian transplantation in animals, steady advances have been made in human subjects. 7 Patients receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy that For women wanting reproductive autonomy, or those without a male partner, oocyte cryopreservation has become the standard method of preserving fertility.220 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 4, may 2018 bcmj.orgFertility preservation for young cancer patients targets the ovary can be considered candidates for ovarian tissue cryo-preservation, particularly if they are undergoing abdominal surgery. At an appropriate time after completion of the patient's cancer therapy, the tis - sue is thawed and transplanted ortho-topically or heterotopically within the pelvis. The major barrier for this tech - nology is survival of the transplant. With fewer than 100 documented live births from transplanted ovar - ian tissue, the potential for reseeding of metastatic disease, and the surgi- cal risks inherent in undergoing two procedures, ovarian transplantation is considered experimental and gener - ally reserved for cases where oopho-rectomy is already planned. Sperm freezing For men, fertility preservation typ-ically involves cryopreservation of ejaculated sperm. 7 Rarely, surgical collection directly from the epididy-mis or testicle is required. The testicle is very sensitive to even low doses of systemic chemotherapeutic agents. Additionally, cancer patients com-monly present with reduced sperm counts secondary to their illness. Re-duction of spermatogenesis results from effects on the epithelium. Ley-dig function is typically unaffected, so testosterone deficiency is uncommon. Oligospermia and azoospermia rates range from 70% to 98% depending on the follow-up period. Spermato - genesis can recover at variable times, so long-term sperm testing is rec - ommended. 34 Some patients are ren- dered azoospermic for life, and one study found cancer survivors were 50% more likely to be infertile. 34,35 Importantly, fetal malformation rates are elevated for up to 2 years follow-ing chemotherapy, so sperm should be banked prior to treatment for both fertility preservation and the health of any offspring. 36 The amount of sperm required for banking will depend on the clinical scenario, timeline to treat - ment, and availability of the patient. Preserving fertility in children and adolescents Cure rates for childhood cancers ex- ceed 80% for most types. Despite the larger ovarian reserve of most young patients going into treatment, subfertility and gonadal failure are possible after childhood exposure to chemotherapy, making future repro-ductive function a growing survivor - ship issue for these patients as they transition into adulthood. The Child-hood Cancer Survivor Study, which compared patients exposed to chemo-therapy with randomly selected sib-lings, found a thirteenfold increase in the rate of ovarian failure in female cancer survivors. 37 Children and adolescents with cancer are frightened, but their ability to understand the impact that medical treatments will have in future should not be discounted. They typically lack knowledge about their own reproduc-tion and existing technologies for as-sisting with fertility, but do eventually want children. 1 Assuming that fertility preservation procedures are technical-ly possible, all fertility preservation techniques are available to these pa - tients. There are no legal restrictions in Canada to the application of assist-ed reproductive technology in pediat-ric cases, so long as the reproductive material is reserved for the patient. Decisions on proceeding with treatment need to respect the patient's level of understanding of the medical issues, as well as the risks and ben-efits of the technologies. For girls, challenges with vaginal procedures can often be addressed with the use of transabdominal pelvic ultrasound for monitoring of ovarian stimulation and general anesthesia for harvesting of eggs. For boys, sperm recovery will depend on their stage of sexual development. Masturbation and ex-posure to pornography present ethi-cal concerns, but for the most part is the only feasible approach. Obtaining appropriate consent is critical before employing invasive techniques such as testicular sperm retrieval and elec - troejaculation. As well, a fair estimate of the probability of obtaining mature sperm is needed. In terms of reproductive health, transition to adulthood is poorly ad-dressed by our medical system. Ad-equate management should include ovarian reserve surveillance, coun-seling on fertility and sexual health, and provision of egg and embryo Children and adolescents with cancer are frightened, but their ability to understand the impact that medical treatments will have in future should not be discounted. 221 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 4, may 2018 bcmj.orgFertility preservation for young cancer patients banking in cases where a woman's reproductive lifespan is likely to be significantly reduced. All patients must be made aware of the fact that pregnancy is possible in the vast ma-jority of cases, irrespective of gonadal function, through the use of egg and sperm donation technologies. In the event of premature ovarian failure, patients should be counseled on the use of hormone replacement. Barriers to services Recent advances in cryopreservation are providing effective fertility pres-ervation options for Canadians, yet barriers to services exist for cancer patients. A multidisciplinary approach to care and education of oncology pro-fessionals and patients on issues relat-ed to reproduction are both required. More work is needed to increase awareness in BC and to ensure that patients receive appropriate fertility preservation counseling and services in a timely manner. The high cost of these services must also be addressed. Presently, only Ontario and Quebec provide funding for egg, sperm, and embryo banking. Fertile Future, a national charity that is committed to making these treatments affordable for cancer patients, currently provides up to $3000 toward clinical costs for female patients and $350 for male pa-tients. The pharmaceutical companies that manufacture gonadotropins used in IVF have been providing compas-sionate medications for many years. No area of our profession is more in need of public support and we will continue to lobby provincially and federally for these critical services. Summary While modern chemotherapeutic protocols are highly effective at de - stroying malignant cells, they also lead to infertility in a sizable percent - age of patients. This is a challenging survivorship issue for fertility spe - cialists and cancer specialists alike. Fertility preservation for males usu - ally involves freezing sperm, and for females involves ovarian reserve sur - veillance and freezing of embryos, oocytes, or ovarian tissue. Young pa-tients with cancer should be referred to a fertility specialist with the ability to discuss and deliver these services . Competing interests None declared. References 1. Schover LR.

This change is a result of a federally coordinated bulk-purchasing process in which all Canadian jurisdictions participate, and the term for the new contract will be for up to 3 years. As is RV1, the RV5 is a live oral- ly administered vaccine with simi-lar contraindications. Both rotavirus vaccines are recommended for use by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization, without a prefer - ential recommendation for one or the other. Both have been used globally in national immunization programs. Comparable vaccine effectiveness (VE) for the two has been observed in postmarketing surveillance evalu-ation for outcomes of hospitaliza-tion, emergency department visits, and outpatient visits. In low rotavi-rus mortality countries such as Can-ada, for RV1, median VE was 84% (range, 19%-97%) in 13 studies, and for RV5, median VE was 90% (range, 63%-100%) in 20 studies. 1 The main difference for the BC program will be the schedule of im-munization: for RotaTeq, is is three doses, at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, whereas for ROTARIX, it was two doses at 2 and 4 months of age. The series can be started as early as 6 weeks of age, but Canadian recom- bc centre for disease control Transition to a three-dose rotavirus vaccine in BC mendations are for series completion by 8 months and 0 days of age; these parameters are common to both prod-ucts and are based on potential asso-ciation with intussusception. Based on BC immunization registry data for participating health authorities (all but Vancouver Coastal), rotavirus vaccine 2-dose series completion rates have increased by 12% since the first year of the program. By year of birth, these rates are 70% for 2012, 75% for 2013, 79% for 2014, and 81.8% for 2016. 2 In moving to the RotaTeq product, how - ever, providers will need to increase their efforts to achieve on-time im-munization through use of reminders and recalls based on current comple-tion rates for the coadministered DPT-containing vaccine. For infants born in 2016, while 87.6% received 2 doses of DPT-containing vaccine by 8 months of age, only 76.6% have completed 3 doses of DPT-containing vaccine by this milestone; 14.3% never started a series of rotavirus vaccine. BC health units will be working with physician providers as they tran-sition from RV1 to RV5, as the timing of this change will vary depending on remaining RV1 inventory at the local level. The two vaccines are not con-sidered interchangeable and, ideally, infants who commence a series with RV1 should complete the second dose with that product. Those who must transition to RV5 after starting RV1 should receive a total of 3 doses of ro-tavirus vaccine. In several prior surveys of BC par - ents, concern about vaccine safety has been the most frequently cited reason for refusal of vaccines. Both approved rotavirus vaccines have demonstrated high levels of safety and are well toler - ated. While intussusception had been observed at a rate of about 1 in 10 000 recipients with a prior rotavirus vac-cine approved in the USA in the 90s, this adverse event has not been con-sistently observed in all countries and studies using the RV1 and RV5 vac - cines. At present and based on a large number of studies in different global settings, the generally accepted ex-cess risk of intussusception is 1 to 2 cases per 100 000 vaccine recipients, mainly associated with the first dose. 3 This risk, however, has not been de-tectable in the Canadian population using administrative data on hospital - ized intussusception among infants, and in that study there was no increase in the rate of intussusception follow-ing introduction of rotavirus vaccine. 4 Finally, it is important for provid- ers to be aware that administering the rotavirus vaccine prior to injectable vaccines given at the same visit has been demonstrated to provide compa-rable analgesic effect to that of orally administered sucrose solutions. 5 Both rotavirus vaccines contain similar quantities of sucrose 6,7 and this analge- sic effect is expected with use of RV5 given prior to injectable vaccines, of which up to three injections are rec-ommended for coadministration at the 2, 4, and 6 month visits, respectively.

Continued on page 224224 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 4, may 2018 bcmj.orgobituaries It is with much sadness I write of the passing of my friend, a long-time col-league, Dr W.R.J. (Bill) Martin on 26 December 2017. Bill passed away peacefully in his home on Galiano Island surrounded by his beloved family. He was predeceased by his wife, Gwen, and leaves his four chil - dren, Shelley, Sandy, Craig, and Scott and their families. He also leaves two surviving siblings and numerous nieces and nephews. Bill practised ophthalmology in Burnaby for over 30 years in conjunc-tion with a long-term partnership with Drs Jack Siddall, Sam Gibson, Don Matheson, and later Drs Bill Pratt and Larry Daitz. Bill always put the inter - est of his patients first and practised medicine with a high degree of skill and integrity. Bill and Gwen were active in the medical community in Burnaby, and Bill was given a long-term service medal by Burnaby Hos-pital in recognition of his many years of service to that institution and the community. Bill was born and raised in Burn- aby. He and his siblings grew up dur - ing the Great Depression when money and work was scarce. Nevertheless, after the war, Bill attended the Univer - sity of Oregon and UBC where he met and married the love of his life, Gwen, a romance that lasted over 60 years. Bill was a member of the first graduating class of the medical school at UBC in 1954. He did a few years of practice with his boyhood friend, Dr Hugh Pontifex, mostly in Merritt. He loved the challenges of bringing modern medicine to what was then an isolated community.Bill took his eye training at Van- couver General in the late 1950s, and during his residency, he was instru-mental in assisting the new profes-sor of ophthalmology, Dr AJ Elliot, in modernizing and expanding the de-partment at Vancouver General Hos-pital and UBC. Bill and Gwen retired to Galiano Island in 1991 and quickly adapted to island life. Bill spent a few years as a consultant in ophthalmology for the Workers' Compensation Board. He and Gwen traveled widely, and Bill indulged in his lifelong passion of woodworking producing many beau-tiful grandfather clocks and guitars, which are now family treasures. Bill lost his beloved Gwen in 2011. His health began a slow decline and he left us gently in the last days of 2017 in his 91st year. Bill was a man of high intelli- gence, great kindness, and integrity. He adored his family, and his family adored him. His was a life well lived. Rest in peace, my friend. \u2014D.C.
