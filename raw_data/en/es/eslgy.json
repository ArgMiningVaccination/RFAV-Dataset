Yoga was part of my curriculum in school, so my yoga journey began when I was just a child. In addition to [practicing yoga](https://www.myyogateacher.com/articles/) in school, I was very into sports. I represented India TWICE in international throwball tournaments. I'm proud to say that I won both tournaments! My Master's is in Management & Finance and I've worked for multinational companies, a total of 10 years of professional experience. Yet . . . I always had this thought running in my mind . . . that I should do what I love the most! And that is dancing! So, initially, I threw myself into Zumba and became a certified instructor. But this was just a hobby as I kept my job at the multinational company. And then I became a mother . . . My focus completely shifted from my job and moved towards my passion. I made a return to Yoga in addition to teaching Zumba. Since I had a decent amount of practice during my school days, this seemed like a natural thing to do. I completed my [Yoga teacher](https://www.myyogateacher.com/signUp) certification in Bangalore. With my yoga practice, I could see a lot of changes in myself. I was inspired to continue my education and completed a certification in [Ashtanga Yoga](https://www.myyogateacher.com/) of Mysore style from Mysore and a certification to teach advanced yoga. Initially, I just taught classes at gyms and fitness centers, but I knew yoga could do more. I began to teach personal classes for medical patients to help reduce their stress level with Yoga. During my yoga journey, seeing my clients become better in mind, body and spirit has inspired me to teach Yoga and spread Yoga to every community for a Healthy & Happy mind!
