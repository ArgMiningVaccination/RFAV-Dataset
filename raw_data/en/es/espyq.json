What our customers are saying about Balance Dance Studios I have always been impressed by how you have run your businesses, but this response to the COVID-19 situation has deeply impacted me. I appreciate how you are taking detailed steps (proactively and reactively) to this situation. I appreciate how the communications have been clear, complete, and very comfortable to read. I can imagine how exhausting that this situation has been for such a large organization with so many moving parts to it. You and your staff have handled it so well. I am proud to be a part of the Balance Dance family. Dana' Washington 2021-11-08 Both my daughters go and enjoy! S.

I haven't been in over a year because I moved out of state but I have not found any studio remotely close in adult dance options and quality of instructors.
