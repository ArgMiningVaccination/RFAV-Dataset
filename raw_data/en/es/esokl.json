Subpart B - Applicability The applicability subpart determines the production and handling operations that must be certified under the NOP. In general, the NOP provides for many exemptions and exclusions from certification. The applicability subpart also includes recordkeep ing requirements and a broad list of prohibited substances. \u00a7205.100 What has to be certified. 1. Requires all organic production and handling operations to be certified unless they are exempt or excluded from certification. 2. Provides for continuation of certification if the production or handling opera tion is certified by an accredited certifier prior to October 21, 2002. 3. Specifies that knowingly selling a product as organic that is not in compliance with the NOP may result in a $10,000 civil penalty. \u00a7205.101 Exemptions and exclusions from certification. Exemptions 1. Producers that sell less than $5,000 worth of organic products are exempted from organic certification requirements. 2. Handlers that sell less than $5,000 worth of organic products are exempted from organic certification requirements. 3. Organic products from exempt producers and handlers may not be used in processed organic food products. 4. Organic products from exempt producers and handlers may be sold at farmers markets and retail stores as organic. 5. Retail food stores are exempt from organic certification requirements. 6. Processors that produce products with less than 70 percent organic ingredients are exempt from organic certification requirements. 7. Processors that produce products that limit their orga nic claims to the information panel are exempt from organic certification requirements. Exclusions 1. Handlers that only sell packaged organic food products are excluded from organic certification requirements. This exclusion would include produce and grocery distributors. 2. Retailers that have in-store bakeries, delicatessen, salad bar or ready to eat food are excluded from the organic certification requirements. \u00a7 205.102 Use of the term, \"organic.\" USDA National Organic Program Rule Summary Organic Farming Compliance Handbook Specifies that agricultural products sold, labeled, or represented as \"100 percent organic,\" \"organic,\" or \"made with organic ingredients\" must be pr oduced and handled in accordance with the National Organic Program standards. \u00a7205.103 Recordkeeping by certified operations.

Subpart C - Organic Producti on and Handling Requirements \u00a7205.200 General Specifies that organic production practices (for crop and livestock operations) must maintain or improve the natural resources of the ope ration, including soil and water quality. \u00a7205.201 Organic production and handling system plan. This section requires all producers and handlers to ha ve an organic system plan that must include: 1. A narrative or descriptive format that identifies the practices and procedures performed. Practices include the method for applying manure, fertilizers, or pest control materials; mechanical and biological methods used to prepare and combine ingredients; methods used to package finished products; and measures taken to exclude pests from a facility. Examples of procedures include protocols established for locating commercially ava ilable organic seeds, and procedures to inform neighbors about the organic status of the fields. 2. The plan must include a list of all materials that will be applied to the land or within the handling facilities. The plan must also address how the application of these materials meets other requirements of the NOP (e.g. how their plan will prevent an y manure applications from contributing to water contamination). 3. The plan must include a description of the monitori ng practices used to evaluate the effectiveness of the organic plan. Monitoring practices could include soil tests to monitor effectiveness of plan for maintaining or improving soil quality; production objectives such as pounds of product produced per acre; or number of organic apples distributed; or results of pesticide residue tests. 4. The plan must include a description of the recordk eeping system used to track a product from harvest through sale; or receiving through shipping; or identifying each animal in production. 5. Split operations must describe the management practices and physical barriers that have been established to prevent commingling or c ontamination of organic food products. 2 USDA National Organic Program Rule Summary Organic Farming Compliance Handbook 6. Certifying agents may require additional items to be included in the plan to determine if an operation meets the organic requirements. Crop Production \u00a7205.202 Land requirements. 1. Requires organic crops to have had no prohibited mate rials applied within three years of harvest of the crop. 2. Requires distinct boundaries and adequate buffer zones to prevent drift. The NOP does not specify a minimum buffer zone requirement. \u00a7205.203 Soil fertility and crop nutrient management practice standard. 1. Standards require organic producers to select tools (e .g., tillers, plows) and practices that maintain or improve soil quality and minimize soil erosion. 2. Producers are required to utilize crop rotations, c over crops and plant and animal materials to maintain or improve soil organic matter content in a manner that does not contribute to contamination of crops, soil, or water. 3. Prohibits the use of raw manure unless it is incorpor ated into the soil more than 120 days prior to harvest for products whose edible portion is in direct contact with the soil. 4. Prohibits the use of raw manure unless it is incorpor ated into the soil more than 90 days prior to harvest for products whose edible portion does not have direct contact with the soil. 5. Defines compost as material that has an initial C:N ratio of between 25:1 and 40:1. Requires compost to reach specific temperature parameters for specific time periods. 6. Allows use of uncomposted plant materials. 7. Allows mined substances of low solubility. 8. There are many questions about allowable materials for managing soil fertility. \u00a7205.204 Seeds and planting stock practice standard. 1. Requires annual transplants to be organically grown from seed. 2. Requires perennial transplants to be-organi cally grown for one year prior to harvest. 3. Requires use of organic seeds unless organic seeds are commercially unavailable. Producers have to choose an \"equivalent\" organic seed variety that w as commercially available. The term, \"equivalent,\" indicates that two seed varieties have similar perfo rmance attributes, such as resistance to drought and insects, and production traits, including yield, size, and shape of the commodity. 4. If organic seeds are unavailable, requires use of untreated seeds. 5. If untreated seeds are unavailable, only allows use of seeds treated with a substance included on the National List. There are currently no allowed seed treatments on the National List. Thus, the NOP currently prohibits the use of tr eated seeds under all circumstances. \u00a7205.205 Crop rotation practice standard. Crop rotation is required. There is a requirement fo r cover crops and/or habitat required in perennial crops to provide for pest management. \u00a7205.206 Crop pest, weed, and disease management practice standard. The producer must use practices to prevent crop p ests, weeds, and diseases. These practices include crop rotation, sanitation measures, and cultural practi ces. Producers may use other preventative practices including beneficial insects and natural habitat e nhancement. If the preventative practices are not adequate to prevent or control pests the producer may use materials allowed under the National List. \u00a7205.207 Wild-crop harvesting practice standard. 3 USDA National Organic Program Rule Summary Organic Farming Compliance Handbook Wild crops harvested from non-agricultural lands can be sold and labeled as organic as long as no prohibited materials have been applied to the land for 3 years and the harvest of the crop is not destructive to the environment.

Ce rtifiers must apply to renew their accreditation at least six months prior to the expiration date of their accreditation. Subpart G - Administrative 12 USDA National Organic Program Rule Summary Organic Farming Compliance Handbook The National List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances The National List within the NOP is constructed very differently than most organic materials lists (e.g Organic Material Review Institute's Generic and Br and Name Lists). Under the NOP all nonsynthetic substances (= natural materials) are allowed to be used unless they are specifically prohibited. Conversely, all synthetic substances are prohibited unl ess specifically allowed. The difficulty with this approach is that it is often difficult to determine whether a material is natural or synthetic. In addition, many materials that are approved for use in organi c crop production are not included on the National List because they are nonsynthetic (= natural). The NOP definition of synthetic is \"a substance that is formulated or manufactured by a chemical process or by a process that chemically changes a substance extracted from naturally occurring sources, except that such term shall not apply to substan ces created by naturally occurring biological processes.\" It may be difficult to determine whether materials su ch as calcium chloride, humic acid, fish emulsion and mined materials are synthetic or natural under this defi nition. The NOP has left a lot of materials open to interpretation. Who will determine whether a material is synthe tic or natural? It appears that the NOP has given that discretion to the certifying agent. 205.600 Evaluation criteria for allowed and prohibit ed substances, methods, and ingredients. The criteria for adding a synthetic substance to th e National List for use in organic crop production or for adding to processed organic food is: 1. The substance cannot be produced from a natural source. 2. The substance's manufacture, use and disposal does not have an adverse effect on the environment. 3. The nutritional quality of the food is maintained when the substance is used. 4. The substance's breakdown products do not ha ve an adverse effect on human health. 5. The substance's primary use is not as a preservative or to recreate flavors lost during processing. 6. If used in food, the substance is listed as generally regarded as safe (GRAS) by FDA. 7. The substance is essential to the handling of organic food products. 205.601 Synthetic substances allowed for use in organic crop production. 1. This section contains a list of synthetic materials allo wed to be used for pest control, weed control, disease control and soil management. 2. The Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI) Generic Materials List includes allowed non- synthetic and prohibited synthetic substances, as we ll as substances that appear on the National List. 3. The only inert ingredients allowed on the National List are List 4 Inert Ingredients (Inerts of Minimal Concern). Many currently approved brand name materials will be prohibited because they contain List 3 inerts. Manufacturers of these materials will need to either a) reformulate their products; b) expedite the review of the List 3 inerts to List 4 status, or c) petition the NOSB to have the material added to the list of appr oved synthetic substances. 205.602 Nonsynthetic substances prohibited for use in organic crop production. This section contains a list of natural materials prohibited for use as pest control substances or soil amendments. The prohibited natural materials list in cludes strychnine, sodium fluoaluminate (cryolite), tobacco dust (nicotine), arsenic, and ash from manure burning. This section also includes restrictions on the use of sodium nitrate (only for up to 20% of nitrogen inputs) and potassium chloride (mined sources only). 205.603 Synthetic substances allowed for use in organic livestock production. 13 USDA National Organic Program Rule Summary Organic Farming Compliance Handbook This section contains a list of synthetic materi als allowed as feed additives, feed supplements, parasiticides, disinfectants and medicines in organic livestock production. 205.604 Nonsynthetic substances prohibited for use in organic livestock production. This section contains a list of natural materials that are prohibited for use in organic livestock production. At the present time, only strychnine appears on the list. 205.605 Nonagricultural (nonorganic) substances allowed as ingredients in or on processed products labeled as \"organic\" or \"made with organic (specified ingredients or food group(s)).\" 1. Many food products contain both agricultural and nonagricultural ingredients. Nonagricultural ingredients include substances such as salt, pectin, baking soda and citric acid. Under the NOP, nonagricultural ingredients and processing aids must be listed in this section in order to be used in an \"organic\" food (more than 95% organic ingredients) or \"made with organic\" food (more than 70% organic ingredients). 2. Approved natural nonagricultural ingredients a nd processing aids include citric acid, non GMO enzymes, sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), nutritional and baking yeast. 3. Approved synthetic nonagricultural ingredients and processing aids include ascorbic acid, lecithin, and pectin. 205.606 Nonorganically produced agricultural pro ducts allowed as ingredients in or on processed products labeled as \"organic\" or \"made with organic (specified ingredients or food group(s)).\" Requires agricultural ingredients used in an \"organic\" food (more than (95% organic ingredients) to be organically produced unless the ingredient is not commercially available in organic form. 205.607 Amending the National List. This section states that any person may petition the National Organic Standards Board to add materials to the National List. State Organic Programs The NOP provides four options for States. 1. A state may be a state certifying agent. States that currently run state certification agencies include Washington, Idaho, Texas, Maryland, L ouisiana, Nevada, Iowa, and Kentucky. 2. A state may have a State organic program. The State of California is a good example of a State with a State organic program that does not provide certification services. The California Department of Food and Agriculture enforces California's Orga nic Food Products Act and obtains money for enforcement through registration fees. 3. A state may be a state certifying agent and have a State organic program. 4. A state may choose to not have a State organic program or be a state certifying agent (e.g. Wyoming, New York, Arkansas, Kansas) 205.620 Requirements of State organic programs. 1. Specifies that any State may establish a State organic program . 2. Specifies that State organic programs must meet the NOP requirements. 3. Allows a State to have more restrictive requireme nts because of environmental conditions or specific production or handling practices. 4. Requires a State organic program to assume enforcement obligations of the NOP. 5. Requires a State organic program to be approved by the USDA Secretary prior to implementing its state program. 14 USDA National Organic Program Rule Summary Organic Farming Compliance Handbook 205.621 Submission and determination of proposed State organic program s and amendments to approved State organic programs. This section includes the details of the information that must be submitted by a State in order for a State organic program to be approved under the NOP. 205.622 Review of approved State organic programs. Specifies that NOP must review State organic programs at least once every five years. Fees Sections 205.640 and 205.641 205.642 These sections specify the costs for accreditation. Accreditation costs for initial accreditation (until August 2002) will be $500 plus travel and per diem char ges for site visits. There will be no hourly rate charged for the initial accreditation. After August 2002, an hourly rate will be charged for site visits (Note: the current hourly rate is $42/hour). 205.642 Fees and other charges for certification. 1. Certifiers are required to charge reasonable fees for the certification services they provide. 2. Certifiers are required to publish their fee schedul es, provide justification for any nonrefundable fees that are charged. Compliance The NOP compliance proceedings are similar to administrative procedures of many states. 205.660 General This section specifies that the NOP may conduct in spections or initiate revocation proceedings against a certified operation or a certifying agents accreditation. 205.661 Investigation of certified operations. Allows certifying agents and State organic programs to investigate complaints of noncompliance with the NOP regulations. 205.662 Noncompliance procedure for certified operations. Specifies the procedures that certifiers and State organic programs must take for any compliance action. The procedures provide due process for certified operations. The procedures outline notification procedures, resolution options, proposed suspension or revocation notices, and procedures for willful violations. 205.663 Mediation. This section specifies the procedures for a mediated settlement of noncompliance proceedings. Mediation is not mandated but offered as an option fo r settlement of a noncompliance proceeding. 205.665 Noncompliance procedure for certifying agents and 205.668 Noncompliance procedures under State organic programs. These sections specify the procedures for noncomp liance proceedings against certifying agents and State organic programs respectively. 15 USDA National Organic Program Rule Summary Organic Farming Compliance Handbook 205.670 Inspection and testing of agricultural product to be sold or labeled \"organic.\" 1. Organic food products must be available for sampling for pesticide residues. 2. State organic programs or certifying agents may require preharvest or postharvest testing when there is reason to believe that the product has come into contact with a prohibited substance or has been produced using genetically modified ingredients. 3. Sampling may only be conducted when there is reason to believe that there may be residues present. This may require the SOP's and state certification agencies to only sample producers where there is a risk of pesticide drift, residual soil contamination, or misapplication of prohibited substances. On the other hand, it could probably be demons trated that in all situations there is a reason to believe that the product may have come into contact with prohibited substances. 4. Sampling must be done by qualified inspectors and must maintain chain of custody. 5. Chemical analysis must be done by official methods of analysis. 6. Results of all analyses must be provided to the Na tional Organic Program and must be available for public access. 205.671 Exclusion from organic sale. 1. The NOP establishes an organic tolerance level at 5% of the Environmental Protection Agency's tolerance levels for registered pesticides. 2. The NOP establishes the FDA action level as the organic tolerance level for pesticides that are no longer registered (e.g. DDT, dieldrin, chlordane). 3. When residues are detected that exceed these levels the products must not be sold, labeled or represented as organic. 205.672 Emergency pest or disease treatment. 1. Allows a prohibited substance to be applied to a certified organic operation as part of a Federal or State emergency pest or disease control program. 2. Prohibits any crop or product that has come into c ontact with a prohibited substance to be labeled, represented or sold as organic. 3. This section protects consumers by prohibiting any organic crops from having prohibited substances applied to them while also protecting the organi c producer from losing their organic certification due to an emergency pest control program outside of their control. Adverse Action Appeal Process \u00a7205.680 General and \u00a7205.681 Appeals. This section describes the appeals process for person's that believe that they are adversely affected by a noncompliance decision of the National Organic Program, a State organic program, or a certifying agent. The primary difference between the NOP app eal process and the current state process is that appeals would be appealed to a U.S. District Court rather than a State court. This section is currently the subject of an appeal by an accredited certification agent.
