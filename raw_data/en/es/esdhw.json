The IOM committee uncovered no evidence of major safety concerns associated with adherence to the childhood immunization schedule, which should help to reassure a diverse group of stakeholders. Rather than exposing children to harm, following the complete childhood immunization schedule is strongly associated with reducing vaccine-preventable diseases.

Adverse Effects of Vaccines: Evidence and Causality August 25, 2011 The Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academies The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) asked the IOM to assess the risk of specific adverse events associated with eight vaccines - varicella zoster, influenza (except 2009 H1N1) hepatitis B, HPV, MMR, hepatitis A, meningococcal, and those that contain tetanus, and evaluate the scientific evidence about the event-vaccine relationship. Using epidemiologic and mechanistic evidence, the committee developed 158 causality conclusions and assigned each relationship between a vaccine and an adverse health problem to one of four categories of causation: - Evidence convincingly supports a causal relationship - Evidence favors acceptance of a causal relationship - Evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship - Evidence is inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship The IOM committee found that evidence convincingly supports a causal relationship between some vaccines and some adverse events\u2014such as MMR, varicella zoster, influenza, hepatitis B, meningococcal, and tetanus-containing vaccines linked to anaphylaxis. Additionally, evidence favors rejection of five vaccine-adverse event relationships, including MMR vaccine and autism, and inactivated influenza vaccine and asthma episodes. However, for the majority of cases (135 vaccine-adverse event pairs), the evidence was inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship. Overall, the IOM committee concluded that few health problems are caused by or clearly associated with vaccines.

The committee provided independent, non-biased advice to vaccine policy-makers, as well as healthcare practitioners and the public. This eighth and final report of the IOM's ISR examines the hypothesis that vaccines, specifically the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and thimerosal-containing vaccines, are causally associated with autism. The committee reviewed the published and unpublished epidemiological studies regarding causality and studies of potential biologic mechanisms by which these immunizations might cause autism. The committee concludes that the body of epidemiological evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism. The committee also concludes that the body of epidemiological evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. The committee further finds that potential biological mechanisms for vaccine-induced autism that have been generated to date are theoretical only. The committee does not recommend a policy review of the current schedule and recommendations for the administration of either the MMR vaccine or thimerosal-containing vaccines. The committee recommends a public health response that fully supports an array of vaccine safety activities. In addition, the committee recommends that available funding for autism research be channeled to the most promising areas. The committee makes additional recommendations regarding surveillance and epidemiological research, clinical studies, and communication related to these vaccine safety concerns.

The committee provided independent, non-biased advice to vaccine policy-makers, as well as healthcare practitioners and the public. The Immunization Safety Review committee reviewed the data on influenza vaccine and neurological conditions and concluded that the evidence favored acceptance of a causal relationship between the 1976 Swine Influenza vaccine and GBS in adults. The evidence about GBS for influenza vaccines of other years is not clear one way or the other (that is, the evidence is inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship). The committee concluded that the evidence favored rejection of a causal relationship between influenza vaccines and exacerbation of multiple sclerosis. For the other neurological conditions studied, the committee concluded the evidence about the effects of influenza vaccine is inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship. The committee also reviewed theories on how the influenza vaccine could damage the nervous system. The evidence was at most weak that the vaccine could act in humans in ways that could lead to these neurological problems.

The committee provided independent, non-biased advice to vaccine policy-makers, as well as healthcare practitioners and the public. The Immunization Safety Review committee reviewed the evidence regarding the hypothesis that multiple immunizations increase the risk for immune dysfunction, with a focus on evidence related to risk for infections, the autoimmune disease type I diabetes, and allergic disorders. The committee found that evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between multiple immunizations and increased risk for infections and for type I diabetes. They also found that epidemiological evidence regarding risk for allergic disease, particularly asthma, was inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship. The committee recommended continued attention in the form of policy analysis, research, and communication strategy development to inform those concerned about these issues and to encourage parents to vaccinate their children.

In Immunization Safety Review: Thimerosal-Containing Vaccines and Neurodevelopmental Disorders, the IOM committee carefully examines this issue. The committee found no proof that vaccines with thimerosal do or do not cause the disorders of autism, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, and speech or language-delay.

Annals of Internal Medicine This was a very large, nationwide cohort study of all children born in Denmark to Danish-born mothers from January 1, 1999 through December 31, 2010. The study results strongly support that MMR vaccination does not increase the risk for autism, does not trigger autism in susceptible children, and is not associated with clustering of autism cases after vaccination. It adds to previous studies through significant additional statistical power, and by addressing hypotheses of susceptible subgroups and clustering of cases.

Pediatrics Concerns about vaccine safety have led some parents to decline recommended vaccination of their children, leading to the resurgence of diseases. Reassurance of vaccine safety remains critical for population health. This study systematically reviewed the literature on the safety of routine vaccines recommended for children in the United States. Study authors found evidence that some vaccines are associated with serious adverse events; however, these events are extremely rare and must be weighed against the protective benefits that vaccines provide.

Vaccine After performing the meta-analysis of five cohort studies and five case-control studies, the authors of this research found no evidence of a link between vaccine receipt and risk of developing autism or autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). This conclusion stands when the authors looked at specific MMR vaccines, cumulative mercury dosage, and thimerosal exposure, and any connection to ASDs.

PLoS One The presence of measles virus (MV) RNA in bowel tissue from children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances was reported in 1998. Subsequent investigations found no associations between MV exposure and ASD but did not test for the presence of MV RNA in bowel or focus on children with ASD and GI disturbances. Failure to replicate the original study design may contribute to public concern with respect to the safety of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The objective of this case-control study was to determine whether children with GI disturbances and autism are more likely than children with GI disturbances alone to have MV RNA and/or inflammation in bowel tissues and if autism and/or GI episode onset relate temporally to receipt of MMR. This study found strong evidence against association of autism with persistent MV RNA in the GI tract or MMR exposure. Autism with GI disturbances is associated with elevated rates of regression in language or other skills and may represent an endophenotype distinct from other ASD.

Pediatrics The purpose of this work was to estimate the pervasive developmental disorder prevalence in Montreal, Canada, in cohorts born from 1987 to 1998 and evaluate the relationship of trends in pervasive developmental disorder rates with: (1) changes in cumulative exposure to ethylmercury (thimerosal) occurring through modifications in the immunization schedule of young children and (2) trends in measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination use rates and the introduction of a 2-MMR dosing schedule during the study period. The authors concluded that the prevalence of pervasive developmental disorder in Montreal was high, increasing in recent birth cohorts as found in most countries. Factors accounting for the increase include a broadening of diagnostic concepts and criteria, increased awareness and, therefore, better identification of children with pervasive developmental disorders in communities and epidemiologic surveys, and improved access to services. The study's findings ruled out an association between pervasive developmental disorder and either high levels of ethylmercury exposure comparable with those experienced in the U.S. in the 1990s or 1- or 2-dose MMR vaccinations.

Pediatrics A link has been suggested between measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and a form of autism that is a combination of developmental regression and gastrointestinal symptoms that occur shortly after immunization. This hypothesis has involved 3 separate claims: 1) that there is new phenotype of autism involving regression and gastrointestinal symptoms, 2) that this new variant is responsible for the alleged rise of autism rates, and 3) that this phenotype is associated with biological findings suggestive of the persistence of measles infection. We tested the first of these claims. If this new \"autistic enterocolitis\" syndrome had some validity, then 1 or several of the following 6 predictions should be supported by empirical data: 1) childhood disintegrative disorder has become more frequent, 2) the mean age of first parental concern for autistic children who are exposed to MMR is closer to the mean immunization age than in children who are not exposed to MMR, 3) regression in the development of children with autism has become more common in MMR-vaccinated children, 4) the age of onset for autistic children with regression clusters around the MMR immunization date and is different from that of autistic children without regression, 5) children with regressive autism have distinct symptom and severity profiles, and 6) regressive autism is associated with gastrointestinal symptoms and/or inflammatory bowel disorder. The study found no evidence to support a distinct syndrome of MMR-induced autism or of \"autistic enterocolitis.\" These results add to the recent accumulation of large-scale epidemiologic studies that all failed to support an association between MMR and autism at population level. When combined, the current findings do not argue for changes in current immunization programs and recommendations.

International Archives of Allergy and Immunology Volunteers were vaccinated with three doses of yeast-derived hepatitis B vaccines at monthly intervals and compared with plasma derived vaccines. Before and four weeks after immunizations, blood samples were tested for presence of IgE or IgG antibodies against yeast antigens related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans, respectively, as cross-reactivity exists between the two genera. No rise in IgE antibodies against Saccharomyces cerevisiae antigens nor in IgG antibodies against Candida albicans antigens was found.

Journal of Infection The antigen used in the yeast-recombinant hepatitis B vaccine is derived from a culture of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (common baker's yeast) and trace quantities of yeast protein exist within the product. As such, there is a theoretical concern that administration of a vaccine prepared in yeast might induce allergic reactions to yeast proteins. Researchers tested the sera of 133 persons before and after receipt of the recombinant vaccine for anti-yeast antibodies. One-hundred percent of individuals had anti-yeast IgG in both pre- and post-vaccination samples, presumably from exposure through eating bread. Levels fluctuated after receipt. Adverse reactions were not more frequent in persons with rises in yeast antibody titers.

The New England Journal of Medicine The introduction of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) into the U.S. childhood immunization schedule in 2000 has substantially reduced the incidence of vaccine-serotype invasive pneumococcal disease in young children and in unvaccinated older children and adults. By 2004, hospitalizations associated with pneumonia from any cause had also declined markedly among young children. Because of concerns about increases in disease caused by nonvaccine serotypes, this study was used to determine whether the reduction in pneumonia-related hospitalizations among young children had been sustained through 2009 and whether such hospitalizations in older age groups had also declined. The study found that declines in hospitalizations for childhood pneumonia were sustained during the decade after the introduction of PCV7. Substantial reductions in hospitalizations for pneumonia among adults were also observed.

JAMA This study was conducted to determine whether receipt of Tdap vaccine during pregnancy administered in close intervals from prior tetanus-containing vaccinations is associated with acute adverse events in mothers and adverse birth outcomes in neonates. The study findings suggest that relatively recent receipt of a prior tetanus-containing vaccination does not increase risk after Tdap vaccination in pregnancy.

Pediatrics Pertussis is poorly controlled with the highest rates of morbidity and mortality among infants. Although the source of infant pertussis is often unknown, when identified, mothers have historically been the most common source of transmission. This study examined whether infant source of infection (SOI) has changed in the United States in light of the changing epidemiology. The study authors found, in contrast to previous studies, that data suggests that the most common source of transmission to infants is now siblings. While continued monitoring of SOIs will optimize pertussis prevention strategies, recommendations for vaccination during pregnancy should directly increase protection of infants, regardless of SOI.

PNAS Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder. Some anecdotal reports suggest that ASD is related to exposure to ethyl mercury, in the form of the vaccine preservative, thimerosal, and/or receiving the measles, rhesus macaques receiving thimerosalcontaining vaccines (TCVs) following the recommended pediatric vaccine schedules from the 1990s and 2008, researchers examined behavior, and neuropathology in three brain regions found to exhibit neuropathology in postmortem ASD brains. No neuronal cellular or protein changes in the cerebellum, hippocampus, or amygdala were observed in animals following the 1990s or 2008 vaccine schedules. Analysis of social behavior in juvenile animals indicated that there were no significant differences in negative behaviors between animals in the control and experimental groups. These data indicate that administration of TCVs and/or the MMR vaccine to rhesus macaques does not result in neuropathological abnormalities, or aberrant behaviors, like those observed in ASD.

Vaccines Are Not Associated With Autism: An Evidence-Based Meta-Analysis of Case-Control and Cohort Studies May 9, 2014 Taylor et al. Vaccine After performing the meta-analysis of five cohort studies and five case-control studies, the authors of this research found no evidence of a link between vaccine receipt and risk of developing autism or autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). This conclusion stands when the authors looked at specific MMR vaccines, cumulative mercury dosage, and thimerosal exposure, and any connection to ASDs.

Continuing Increases in Autism Reported to California's Developmental Services System January 1, 2008 Schechter and Grether. Archives of General Psychiatry Previous analyses of autism client data reported to the California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) have been interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that autism is caused by exposure to the preservative thimerosal, which contains ethylmercury. The exclusion of thimerosal from childhood vaccines in the United States was accelerated from 1999 to 2001. The Immunization Safety Review Committee of the Institute of Medicine has recommended surveillance of trends in autism as exposure to thimerosal during early childhood has decreased. The study looked to determine whether trends in DDS autism client data supported the hypothesis that thimerosal exposure is a primary cause of autism. The study authors found that the DDS data did not show any recent decrease in autism in California despite the exclusion of more than trace levels of thimerosal from nearly all childhood vaccines. The DDS data do not support the hypothesis that exposure to thimerosal during childhood is a primary cause of autism.

New England Journal of Medicine This study assessed the association between current neuropsychological performance and exposure to mercury during the prenatal period, the neonatal period (birth to 28 days), and the first 7 months of life. This study does not support a causal association between early exposure to mercury from thimerosal-containing vaccines and immune globulins and deficits in neuropsychological functioning at the age of 7 to 10 years.

American Journal of Medical Genetics To determine whether mothers of children with autism are more likely to be Rh negative (Rh) or to have received RhIg preserved with thimerosal, which is 49.6% ethyl mercury, we surveyed families of children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) ascertained through a Universitybased autism clinic considered free of ascertainment biases related to type of autism or severity. Between 2004 and 2006, 305 mothers of 321 children with an ASD agreed to participate in a telephone interview. Analysis of complete records including the blood group status and RhIg exposure of 214 families showed that Rh status is no higher in mothers of children with autism than in the general population, exposure to antepartum RhIg, preserved with thimerosal is no higher for children with autism and pregnancies are no more likely to be Rh incompatible. This was also true for autism subgroups defined by behavioral phenotype, gender, IQ, regressive onset, head circumference, dysmorphology, birth status, essential, or complex phenotype. These findings support the consensus that exposure to ethylmercury in thimerosal is not the cause of the increased prevalence of autism.

Pediatrics It has been suggested that thimerosal is a risk factor for the development of autism. The authors examined whether discontinuing the use of thimerosal-containing vaccines in Denmark led to a decrease in the incidence of autism. The study found that the discontinuation of thimerosal-containing vaccines in Denmark in 1992 was followed by an increase in the incidence of autism.

December 2019 Bi et al. Human Vaccines and Immunotherapy In this randomized study, the authors evaluated the efficacy and safety of an adjuvanted-HPV 16/18 vaccine in more than 32,000 Finnish adolescent males and females over a 6.5-year period by comparing those who received HPV vaccine to those who received hepatitis B vaccine. The HPV vaccine adjuvant was composed of monophosphoryl-lipid A plus aluminum salts. The incidence of new-onset autoimmune diseases was similar in both vaccine groups. Similarly, those receiving HPV vaccine during pregnancy did not have an increased risk for spontaneous abortion or congenital anomalies.
