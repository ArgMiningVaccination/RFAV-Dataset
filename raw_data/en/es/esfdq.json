Keywords: Indoor air pollution, lung diseases, solid fuel, biomass fuel 3 Introduction The main activities that contribute significantl y to indoor air pollution in low and middle income countries are the use of solid fuels for residential energy, ac tive and passive smoking inside the house, oil mists and fumes from cooking, smoke from burning mosquito coils during the summer and incense st icks during religious rituals, and keeping pets and animals in the same dwelling where individuals live. Globally, over 3 billion people, approximately half of the world's population, rely on the use of biomass (wood, crop residues, twigs, shrubs, dried dung and charcoal) and coal, collectively known as solid fuels, to meet their basic domestic energy de mands for cooking, lighting and heating [1, 2]. The proportion is even more staggering in rural parts of Africa, Central and South America, and Asia, being over 90% [3]. The majority of the solid fuels are burnt in inefficient traditional cookstoves located in places without adequate ventilation, a lthough in Sub-Saharan Africa burning in the open environment is not uncommon [4, 5]. A large variety of harmful substances are released during combustion of solid fuels and remain in the indoor environment at very high levels for a number of hours after cooking and heating has stopped, because of the lack of adequate room ventilation. Most people spend approximately 90% of their time indoors, even more in the case of women, children, elderly and those with ill health. Cooking in de veloping countries is often done by women; and mothers tend to keep their young children, especially infants and toddlers, close by during cooking therefore placing women and children at risk of both acute and long term ill health from emissions of solid fuel combustion. The degree of risk is relate d to the levels of exposure which, in turn, are determined by a number of factors. For instance, kitchen type and the design of living areas in dwellings in developing countries can increase expos ure to indoor air pollutants by several fold through natural (but inadequate) ve ntilation and lack of flues [6, 7]. Seasonality is also important as exposures to indoor air pollutants during the winter are several times higher than in the rest of the year as people spend more time gathering around fires to keep warm. 4 Use of Solid Fuel as Household Energy Access to clean energy (e.g. electricity, natu ral gas) is low in developing countries1, but the situation is even worse in the least developed countries1 and in Sub-Saharan Africa1 (Figure 1), where 82% and 89% of the populations, resp ectively, rely primarily on solid fuels for domestic purposes compared to 56% in developing countries [8]. Variation also exists within these countries. In the least developed countries, as high as 97% of rural population have access only to solid fuels, compared to 73% am ong the urban dwellers. The difference is even more marked in Sub-Saharan Africa (95% vs.58 %) [8]. Most of the solid fuel users do not limit themselves to a single type of fuel but rather combinations of different types depending upon availability. Worldwide, wood is the mo st common biomass used, although coal is predominantly used in China while dried cow du ng is used by a smaller fraction of the rural South Asian populations. 1 Based on the classification by the United Nations Development Programme. There are 140 developing countries, of which 50 are the leas t developed countries and 45 are Sub-Saharan Africa countries. Thirty-one countries belong to both least developed countries and Sub-Saharan Africa categories. 5 Figure 1: Total population using solid fuel s in percentage (with permission from WHO) Trends in biomass fuel use Although the total population in absolute numbers primarily re lying on the use of biomass as residential energy will increase from 2.68 bill ion in 2009 to about 2.77 billion in 2015, and probably remaining at that level until 2030 [9], the proportion of the total population from developing countries will decrease from 54% in 2009 to 51% in 2015, with further reductions to 44% in 2030. In China the population relying on biomass fuel is readily on the decline and is estimated to fall to 19% by 2030. It is antici pated that this trend will be followed by India after 2020 [9] such that by 2030 just 54% of th e Indian population and 52% of other Asian countries will be using traditiona l biomass fuels. Increase in the price of kerosene and bottled gas in the developing countries is one of the main reasons for th is slower transition to cleaner 6 fuels. However, the pace of decline in Sub- Saharan Africa will be much lower compared to other developing countries. Factors preventing the use of clean fuel The influence on the choice of fuel used is mu ltifactorial, but cost and socio-economic status appear to be the main drivers (Figure 2). Less well-off households spend most of their income purchasing food and clothes and for medical expenses. Depending upon the availability of biomass fuels and the distance required to travel to acquire these fuel s, those living in the least developed countries can spend on averag e 2-3 hours weekly in collecting biomass, leaving little or insufficient time for educati on [2] and work, thus making it very difficult for these families to improve their socio-economic st atus. In rural areas of developing countries, poor families often receive subsidy on clean fuels. However, many switch back to biomass when they cannot afford even the subsidised fuel, making them reliant on the cheaper but dirtier alternatives. The other important factor is the unavailability of clean fuels in rural areas, because of the lack of a sustainable supply-chain mechanism and/or the necessary infrastructure to deliver clean fuels. Consequently, clean fuel is not available at all or the demand for clean fuel cannot be met consistently , forcing rural dwellers to continue their dependence on biomass fuels. 7 Characteristics and toxicity of solid fuel use Traditional stoves burning solid fuels have a very low energy conversion efficiency ranging from 12% to 25% depending upon the types of fu els (Figure 2). Approximately 8 to 10 % of the solid fuels undergo partial combustion, ofte n due to inadequate oxygen supply [10]. As a result, one of the main components of bioma ss smoke is carbon (5-20% of wood smoke as particulate mass) which is found in the particul ate fraction of the smoke and is present across a range of particle sizes. Biomass smoke also contains more than 250 organic compounds, varying mainly by the type of fuel burnt and the combustion conditions [11]. Partial oxidation of organic matter generates high levels of carbon monoxide (CO), as well as hydrogen cyanide, ammonia, and nitrogen oxides. In addition, a large number of other toxic and carcinogenic compounds such as polycycli c aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (e.g. benzo[a]pyrene), aldehydes, and free radicals [11] have been demonstrated in biomass smoke. While biomass fuels tend to have low le vels of halogenated compounds, they may be Figure 2 : Energy ladder (ada pted from [2] and [10]) 8 contaminated by chemicals such as pesticides, or mixed with plastics . Certain varieties of coal, particularly in China, have partic ularly high fluoride or silica content [12]. Consequently, burning of these specific fuel s may lead to production of toxic halogen compounds, such as hydrogen chloride, phosgene, dioxin, chloromethane, bromomethane and other halocarbons [13-15]. 9 The toxicity of biomass smoke has been studied extensively in the laboratory. Rats exposed sub- chronically to wood smoke at concentrations of 1 to 10 mg/m3 over weeks showed reduced CO- diffusing capacity and increased airway resistance. There were also mild chronic inflammation and squamous metaplasia in the larynx, alveolar of the alveolar septae [16]. Wood smoke can cause great er levels of DNA damage in lymphocytes than exposure to liquefied petroleum gas combustion products [17] and can both impair macrophage function and be mutagenic [11]. Wood smoke condensates may damage the lens in ra ts, causing discolouration and opacities, probably through oxidation by polycyclic aromatic compounds and metal ions [18] while chemicals such as aldehydes and acrolein found in biomass smoke can cause eye irritation. Biomass smoke is pro-oxidant and burning of biomass fuel may generate high redox active components. In one study from India the oxidative potential of PM from cow dung cake smoke was found to be increased using an in vitro technique involving a synthetic model of the respiratory tract lining fluid [19]. Inadequate combustion of biomass releases CO th at binds with haemoglobin producing carboxy- haemoglobin due to high affinity of haemoglobin to CO (200-250 times) compared to oxygen [2]. Potentially this can reduce oxygen transport to key organs and the developing foetus which may result in low birth weight and perinatal death [20]. In human, acute exposure to sulphur dioxide, often released during biomass burning, can increase bronchial reactivity in normal individuals and cause broncho-constriction in asthmatic individuals at levels of around 100 parts per b illion (ppb). Longer term exposure may increase susceptibility to viral infections of the lung [21]. 10 A few studies have looked at the toxicity of biomass smoke in exposed populations in developing countries. In chronically biomass smoke exposed Indi an women, activation of circulating platelets, neutrophils and monocytes has been reported with hi gh levels of leukocyte-platelet aggregates [22]. As a number of studies on ambient air pollution suggest that particulate pollutants increase fibrinogen levels, thus enhancing blood coa gulation [23], it is plausible that biomass smoke exposure could be a risk factor for cardiovascular events. There have been very few controlled biomass smoke exposure studies [24] in human but there is a suggesti on that exposure at levels of around 250 \u00b5g/m3 is associated with an increase in circ ulating Factor VIII and serum amyloid A, both of which confer an elevated cardiovascular risk. The inherent toxicity of the smoke from biomass burning differs by the type of fuel, implying differential health risks conferred by different fu els. Airborne endotoxin concentrations in homes burning different types of biomass fuels in Nepal a nd Malawi [25] have been reported to be higher than those found in occupational settings [26, 27] and in the indoor environment in developed countries [28]. The median value of endotoxin (in EU/m3) was greatest in households burning maize crop residue (1609 EU/m3) followed by cow dung (365 EU/m3) and wood (113 EU/m3) all values being much greater than 40 EU/m3 [29], a health-based guidance limit recommended in the Netherlands for an 8-hr time weight ed average occupational exposure. Improved cookstoves The most effective way of eliminating exposure to smoke from solid fuels is to switch to cleaner fuels such as electricity but this opti on is not always feasib le. The most realistic alternative would be to redu ce the exposure levels by switching to more efficient improved cookstoves. Major projects to produce and disseminate improved cooking stoves in the developing world have been ini tiated in the last decade. The aims were two-fold. First, by reducing the levels of indoor air pollutants, it was hoped that the health burden would be reduced. Second, by improving burning efficiency, fuel use could be economised to help slow 11 down deforestation and desertif ication. While there is no un iversal definition, generally speaking all improved cookstoves are characte rised by a higher efficiency in thermal conversion, a higher heat transfer ratio, and a more complete combustion (and therefore a lower emission of smoke and other pollutants), co mpared with the \"traditional\" counterparts. Tests (water boiling, kitchen perf ormance and controlled cooking) have been developed and recommended to monitor the performance a nd efficiency of the improved cookstoves Improved cookstoves could be classified on the basi s of (i) the types of fuel used (operable on one single or multiple fuel types), construction materials (made of a single or a combination of materials), portability (fix ed or portable), and end use a pplications (mono-function for cooking only, or multi-function for cooking, room heating, etc.) [30]. The choice of stove should be customised for the target users, ta king into account of local cooking requirements, and affordability and availability of fuels. Lo cal availability of construction materials and maintenance are important keys to long term self-sustainable projects. In areas where improved cookstoves are not available, certain modification of the cooking environment and practices, such as improving ventilation, or even avoiding cooking indoors where possible could be helpful in reducing the smoke exposure. At present, approximately 27% of the tota l population using solid fuels (or 38% of the population in developing countries) have acce ss to improved cookstoves - more than two- thirds (70%) in China, 9% in India and 4% in other South Asian countries. However, in Sub- Saharan Africa and the least developed countries , the figures were as low as 5.8% and 6.6%, respectively [3]. Exposure monitoring Particulate matter (PM) 12 PM is classified on the basis of its aerodynamic diameter (AD) which is a function of particle size, mass and shape. Most of the studies wh ere actual biomass smoke exposures have been measured (as opposed to a simple exposed/ non-exposed classification) have reported exposures as PM 10 (with AD <10 \u00b5m), although more recently PM 2.5 (with AD <2.5 \u00b5m) has been used as a PM metric reflecting the likelihoo d that greater toxicity resides in the smaller size fraction. PM can be measured either by gravimetric techniques or by photometric devices. Gravimetric techniques give an aggreg ate of exposure concentrations over a period of time but photometric techniqu es are gaining popularity as they measure real time PM concentrations in a repeated manner which provi des information on the variation of particle concentration over time and in re lation to different activities. Th e down side of this technique is that measurements need to be calibrated against gravimetric results in the environment where exposure monitoring is to be done as the light scattering method often tends to overestimate PM concentrations [31]. Previous work has shown 24-hr indoor concentrations of PM 10 generated from solid fuels in different settings to be in the range 300-3000 \u00b5g/m3 with peaks reaching as high as 20,000 \u00b5g/m3 during cooking [4, 32-35]. In a wood-using community in Nepal, the 24-hr average PM 2.5 was found to be 680 \u00b5g/m3 (range 616 -744 \u00b5g/m3) [31] similar to other studies from Guatemala (22-hr average = 520 \u00b5g/m3) [4] and China (24-hr average = 489 \u00b5g/m3) [36]. All these reported concentrations are several fold higher than the WHO global ambient air quality guidelines, which recommend that the 24-hr and annual mean PM 10 concentration should not exceed 50 \u00b5g/m3 and 20 \u00b5g/m3 respectively with PM 2.5 not exceeding 25 \u00b5g/m3 and 10 \u00b5g/m3 respectively [37]. These result are several folds higher when compared to the results from the United Kingdom (12-34 \u00b5g/m3) [38] for PM 10 and 35 \u00b5g/m3 or less for total suspended dust in the United States[39]. 13 Carbon monoxide (CO) CO has been suggested as a cheaper but surrogate me asure of indoor air pollu tion caused by burning biomass fuel. CO is measured by using either co lour changing diffusion tubes or electro-chemical monitors. Diffusion tubes can only measure total exposure over time and the CO concentration is indicated by the stain inside the tubes when in contact with CO. More recently, small electro-chemical devices (e.g. HOBO CO loggers, EL-USB-CO l oggers) have been used to measure CO concentrations. These devices are cheaper, smaller and require less power to operate over extended time periods. Bruce et al. (2004) [40] reported 24-hour CO concentrati on in homes using an improved stove of just over 3 parts per million (ppm) compared to 12.4 pp m with open fires while unreported data from Nepal found broadly similar levels (18 ppm), but with substantial increases to around 200 ppm during cooking, while results from Guatemala ( average 5.9 pp m) were similar [41]. The concentration of CO will depend upon the efficiency of fuel combustion and the moisture content of the fuel [42], wet wood fuel generating more smoke and thus more CO due to inco mplete oxidation of the carbon content. WHO recommended time-weighted av erage guidelines for CO are 87 ppm (100 mg/m 3) for 15 min, 52 ppm (60 mg/m3) for 30 min, 26 ppm (30 mg/m3) for 1 hr and 9 ppm (10 mg/m3) for 8 hr [43]. Health effects from exposure to solid fuel smoke It is estimated that 1.9 million people die prem aturely due to exposure to smoke from solid fuel burning [44]. According to the WHO, exposure to smoke from solid fuel burning is ranked as the top environmenta l risk factor worldwide bein g responsible for 3.3% of all mortality and 2.7% of all disability adjusted life years (DALYs) per year [45]. Long term exposure to solid fuel smoke is clearly associat ed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), increased risk of acute respiratory infections/pneumoni a, lung cancer, tuberculosis and cataract [46-52]. The evid ence is weaker for endpoints such as asthma, adverse 14 pregnancy outcomes, cancer of the upper aero-d igestive tract, interst itial lung disease and ischaemic heart disease. More research both fr om animal and human studies are needed to establish the causal association between these health effects and exposure to biomass smoke. Some of the health effects a ssociated with solid fuel smoke exposure are acute and include oxygen desaturation [53] and acu te lower respiratory infect ion (ALRI)/pneumonia [54]. Here we discuss in detail the respiratory health effects associated with smoke from solid-fuel burning. Respiratory Health Effects The epidemiological data on biomass use coming fr om Asia (most of them from South Asia), Sub-Saharan Africa, Central and South Amer ica have provided substantial evidence to suggest that there is an associ ation between exposure to biom ass smoke and COPD in adults and ALRI/pneumonia in children. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases (COPD) COPD, once regarded as a dis ease of developed countries, is now recognised as a common disease in developing countries. COPD is the fourth leading cause of all deaths, around 3 million people dying from the condition in 2004, of which 90% were from low and middle income countries [55]. While the main contribu tory factors to COPD are cigarette smoke and occupational causes, exposure to solid fuel smoke is a major contributory factor in developing countries. Accord ing to WHO estimates, appr oximately 700,000 out of the 2.7 million global deaths due to COPD could be at tributable to indoor air pollution from solid fuels [56] particularly in wo men. However, the purported link between exposure to solid fuel smoke and COPD has often been based on surro gate measures of exposure and no studies have shown a relationship between direct m easurement of biomass smoke exposure and the incidence or prevalence of CO PD. Lower socio-economic status increases the risk of developing COPD although which component factors (e.g. poor housing, poor nutrition, low 15 income, no/poor education) are the most important in influencing COPD and to what extent is unclear. Nevertheless, one indicator of low soci o-economic status, the use of solid fuel, has been suggested as a key causal factor [57- 59]. Although the underlying mechanisms for the development of COPD among non-smokers expos ed to biomass fuels are still unknown, some human challenge [60] and toxicological studies [19, 61] have reported that biomass burning produces chemicals with high oxidative potential and have imp licated that oxidative stress and DNA damage might be one of th e underlying mechanisms responsible for the pathogenesis of COPD [62, 63] in thos e exposed to biomass smoke. Rivera et al [64] compared the lung morphology in COPD secondary to cigarette and biomass smoke and reported that smokers with COPD had larger extent of emphysema and goblet cell metaplasia than women exposed to biomass smoke, but th e latter presented more local scarring and pigment deposition in the lung parenchyma and mo re fibrosis in the small airways. In contrast, Moran-Mendoza et al [65] found that wood smoke exposed non-smoking women had histo-pathological findings (dyspnoea, airw ay obstruction, air trap ping, hypertension) similar to smokers. Studies on solid fuel use and COPD are often observational, small in sample size with insufficient statistical power to show a clear relationship, w ith relevant confounding factors often inadequately addressed. A further issue is the use of non-standard definitions of COPD or chronic bronchitis. Therefore, the findings across studies are open to some caution as the published estimates may be either under- or over-estimates of the true burden. A systematic review and meta-analysis [ 46] identified 23 studies, 10 reporting COPD based on both physician diagnosis and spirometrical definiti ons, 11 reporting chroni c bronchitis based on 16 respiratory questionnaire data and 2 reporting both COPD and chronic bronchitis. The pooled effect estimate for lung function diagnos ed COPD (OR = 2.96, 95% CI 2.01, 4.37) was greater than those diagnose d by doctor in hospital (OR = 2.29, 95% CI 0.70, 7.52) with a combined pooled effect estimate of 2.80 (95% CI 1.85, 4.23) for COPD (Figure 3). Similarly, the pooled effect estimate for chronic bronchi tis (Figure 4) was 2.32 (95% CI 1.92, 2.80). The findings, published in 2010 [46] are similar to a recent meta-analysis [66] published for both chronic bronchitis (OR = 2.52, 95% CI 1.88, 3.38) and COPD (OR = 2.40, 95% CI 1.47, 3.93). Figure 3: Forest plot showing risk of COPD in populations exposed to solid fuel smoke [46] . 17 Figure 4: Forest plot showing ri sk of chronic bronchitis in populations exposed to solid fuel smoke [46] . 18 It is likely that exposure to biomass smoke from an early age will have been important in retarding lung growth. In a study from Nepal where lung function was compared between a biomass smoke exposed population and a non-exposed population [67], the absolute values for various indices of lung function were significantly lower in both men and women in the biomass smoke exposed group, the difference being evident even in the youngest age gr oup studied (16-25 years). This suggests an effect of biomass smoke exposure on lung growth in additi on to any effect on rate of decline of lung function in later years. The prevalence of airflow obs truction (defined by forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) / forced vital capacity (FVC) < 0.70) in the biomass smoke exposed group was almost doubled compared to non-biomass exposed (20% vs 11%). Overall, there is good evidence that exposure to biomass smoke is associated with airflow obstruction and an at least doub ling of the risk of COPD, th e effect being detected by young adulthood. Asthma There is a wide variation in the prevalence of ast hma worldwide [68]. Asthma has been less widely studied in the developing countries compared to the developed countries and understanding of the very different set of risk factors in these countri es associated with its deve lopment, notably indoor environment and lifestyle, is limited. There is evid ence that growing up in an agricultural environment is associated with a reduced risk of developing ast hma, perhaps mediated by exposure to endotoxin [69] so it might be expected that exposure to bi omass, largely occurring in rural communities, might not be associated with development of asthma per se but could be associated with exacerbations of existing asthma or with respiratory symptoms which might lead to a mistaken diagnosis of asthma. Some studies in developing countries have consider ed possible associations with biomass/solid fuel pollutant exposures [70-72]. Samuelsen et al [73] studied allergy adjuvant effect of particles from wood smoke and road traffic in laboratory animal s and found that particles generated from wood burning had about the same capacity to enhance allergic sensitization as road traffic particles, but less 19 than diesel exhaust particles. Acute exposure to biomass smoke causes bronchial irritation, inflammation and increases bronchial reactivity possi bly responsible for exacerbation of asthma [20]. Table 1 : Studies of the relationship between biom ass exposure and asthma prevalence.

All these studies adopted different techniques to determine asthma and none measured actual biomass exposure levels. While this limits the ability to compare th e studies, all show positive associations between indoor air pollution and asthma at least in children. A case-control study in Nepal assessed the home envir onment of school children in relation to asthma, using the International Study of Asthma and Alle rgies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire [74] and found that passive smoking and use of biomass fuels was separately associated with an increased risk of asthma in boys only but keepi ng animals in home was associated with lower risk (OR=0.2, 95% CI 0.1, 0.5) of asthma. This finding is supported by a similar case-control study from Kenya [75] which found that dampness in the child's sleeping area, indo or air pollution and presence of rugs or carpets in child's bedroom were strongly associated with asthma (ORs 2.0 to 4.9) and by a study from Guatemala in relation to asthma symptoms in 4 to 6 year old children [68]. In contrast, a study from 20 Malaysia only found an association of asthma with environmental tobacco smoke and exposure to mosquito coil smoke [76]. A meta-analysis on the above four studies showed that exposure to indoor air pollution approximately doubles the risk of developing asthma in children (OR = 1.96, 95% CI 1.29, 2.99) but some caution needs to be taken in interpretation as the methodolog y was imperfect in some way in all studies. Only one study has considered biomass smoke expos ure and asthma in adults [68]. Using a simple approach to defining asthma (a positive response by the head of household to the question: \"Does anyone listed suffer from asthma?\" ) the study found that people living in houses using biomass as a domestic fuel and being an active smoker had a si gnificantly higher risk of asthma. Although this study found that asthma in elderly men and women (> 60 years) is associated with use of biomass fuel, the exposure was based on a crude yes/no response and there is a high possibility of misclassifying asthma. In summary, the evidence possibly supports a role for biomass exposure being causally related to asthma in children but formal, well designed studies are needed to confirm this possibility. In particular methods should ensure as tight a diagnosis of asthma as possible (perhaps including measures of bronchial reactivity e.g. using mannitol challenge or exercise) to determine whether these findings simply reflect a pattern of asthma-like symptoms or true asthma. Acute respiratory infection (ARI) ARI can be divided into two types - upper re spiratory tract infections (URI) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRI) which can in turn be categorised on clinical conditions, aetiology and markers of severity[59]. Though there are clinic al and epidemiological criteria to separate URI from LRI, worldwide there are no uniformly accepted definitions used in epidemiological research. The lack of a unifo rmly accepted definition of ARI may cause bias 21 that would contribute to the he terogeneity in reporting across different studies. The possible mechanism related to respiratory infection from acute exposure to pa rticulate matter from biomass burning might be due to reduced mu cociliary clearance and long term exposure increasing susceptibility to bacteria l and viral lung infections [20]. LRI are major causes of morbidity and mortality leading to over four million deaths per year worldwide, approximately 69% of which occu r in developing countries [77, 78]. After neonatal deaths, ARI (17%) is the second leading cause of de aths in children under 5 years and the fourth leading cause of death in the world where 7.4% wo men and 7.1% men die annually due to respirator y infections [78]. In low-income countries respiratory infection is the leading cause of deaths (11.2%, 2.94 million) [78]. Mortality due to respiratory in fection is higher in the under 5 years and 60 years or above age groups. Young children exposed to solid fuel smoke have two to three times more risk of serious ARI than unexposed childr en [59]. Deaths due to respir atory diseases are highest in African countries followed by eastern Mediterranean and then south-east Asian countries [78] where most of the people are of low socio-ec onomic status. More than 70% of the population in these areas use solid fuels for domestic purpos es and respiratory deaths from respiratory tract infections could well be attributed to the high exposure from the burning of biomass/solid fuel. Exposure to air polluta nts might increase the incidence of ARI by adversely affecting specific and non-specific defences of the respiratory tract against pathogens [79]. It is important to emphasise that death due to ARI is mainly associated with lower respiratory infection rather than upper respiratory infection. 22 A longitudinal study in rural Kenya studied ARI and acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI) in children under the age of 5 years [ 5, 80]. The study measured biomass exposure as PM 10 and found a dose-response relationship between PM 10 and the increase in ARI and ALRI frequency. The rates of ARI and ALRI were higher for exposures of PM 10 below 1000- 2000 g/m3 but the rate of increase declined where exposure con centrations were above 2000 \u00b5g/m3. A longitudinal study (1984-1985) in Nepal of children under 2 years showed a possible relationship between ARI and average number of hours spent in the kitchen (OR = 2.2) reported by the mother [81]. A suggestion of a dose-response relationshi p was found in this study but the exposure assessment was not validated. A case-control study from urban Nigeria did not find significant associations between age, nutritional status, environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposur e, location of cooking and crowding with ALRI [82]. Mishra (2003) studied acute respiratory inf ection in pre-school children (under 5 years) in Zimbabwe and found that approximately 16% of the children had ARI [83] at the time of their survey. The study reported that, after adjusting for a ppropriate confounders, child ren in households using biomass were more than twice (OR = 2.2) as lik ely to suffer from ARI as children from households using clean fuel for domestic purposes. A one year cohort study carried out in 500 Gambian children under 5 years [84] reported that parental smoking appeared (non-significantly) to increase the risk of ALRI. However, the risk of ALRI was 6 times higher in girls than in boys, perhap s due to the fact that girls are carried on mother's back more often than boys during cooking and hence are exposed more to biomass exposure. A meta-analysis of 24 studies relating to pneumoni a in children under 5 years exposed to smoke from solid fuels showed the exposure to solid fuel sm oke approximately doubles the risk of pneumonia (OR 23 = 1.78, 95% CI 1.45, 2.18) [85]. There is thus c onsistent evidence that biomass smoke exposure is associated with an increased risk of ARI/pneumonia in children. Tuberculosis (TB) There is inconsistent evidence that exposure to biomass smoke increases the risk of TB [86, 87]. The proposed mechanism is that biomass smoke compromises the respiratory system's ability to resist infection by M. tuberculosis or to resist development of active TB in already infected persons [88]. There is enough evidence to support the belief that current and/or former smoking is associated with TB [87, 89- 93] and some evidence to suggest that passive smoking is also a risk factor [94, 95] acting via a range of potential immune mechanisms. Similarly, biomass exposure interferes with th e mucociliary clearance [96] and decreases several antibacterial properties of lung macrophages, such as adherence and phagocytic rate [97, 98] providing theoretical mechanistic reasons to support the possibility that biomass smoke might be a risk factor for TB. The available data suggest ( Table 2 ) that there might be a causal link between exposure to biomass smoke and either an increased risk of acquiring TB or progression of TB to clinical disease. There are very few studies that have explored this link and there is heterogeneity in design, measurement of outcome and the magnitude of risk estimates which n eed to be explored further to come to a firm conclusion. Most of the studies related to biomass us e and TB suggest that prevalence of TB is higher in communities with poor sanitation and lower socio-economic status and these communities primarily uses solid fuel for domestic purposes. A meta-analysis on the 10 studies mentioned in Table 2 revealed a pooled effect estimate (OR) of 1.55 (95% CI 1.11, 2.18) suggesting that individuals exposed to solid fuel smoke are 55% more likely to get tuberculosis compared to a non-solid fuel 24 smoke exposed group. While there was significant heterogeneity among the studies (I2= 70%, p<0.001), no significant publication bias was reported.

While smoking is the major risk factor, as many as a quarter of cases are not attributable to tobacco use [102]. Lung cancer in never smokers is more common in women than men although there is considerable regional vari ation in the proportions of non-25 smoking females with lung cancer; for instance, in East and South Asia, up to 83% of female lung cancer cases are never smokers, compared to 15% in the United States [102]. Emissions from combustion of solid fuels have been s hown to have high concentrations of PAHs, benzo[a]pyrene and PM 2.5, which in turn have been asso ciated with high lung cancer rates [102]. A meta-analysis of 28 studies re lating to lung cancer exposed to solid fuel smoke showed a greater effect of coal smoke on lung can cer rates (OR = 1.82, 95% CI 1.60, 2.06) with biomass smoke, predominantly wood, (OR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.17, 1.94) and mixed biomass fuel smoke (OR = 1.13, 95% CI 0.52, 2.46) showing lesser effects. The higher risk of lung cancer in coal users was not surprising as combustion products obtained from in-home coal burning contain a range of PA Hs classified as Group 1 carcinogens [103]. The general mechanism emerged from PAHs such as o[a]pyrene (BaP) is genotoxicity where BaP metabolises to electrophilic form that a dducts to DNA. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified combustion products from biomass (primarily wood) use as probably carcinogenic to human s (Group 2A) for lung cancer due to \"limited evidence\" in humans and e xperimental animals [103]. One methodological issue in such analyses is the use of appropriate comparison populations. The pooled effect size obtained from st udies using population (OR = 1.83, 95% CI 1.51, 2.21) based controls (carrying 56% weight) were greater than those using hospital (OR = 1.63, 95% CI 1.34, 1.97) based controls (39% wei ght). This suggests the evidence of the carcinogenicity of biomass smoke is still not conclusive, supporti ng the IARC evaluation. Cigarette smoking [104, 105] has been widely iden tified as the main contributory factor for lung cancer worldwide but no objective measurem ent of smoking was car ried out in any of 26 the studies included here. However, all studies included in this review either adjusted for smoking or studied a population of non-smokers . While it is accepted that self-reported smoking history is the best that can be achie ved when considering life-long smoking details, objective measurement of smoking, su ch as salivary cotinine, is becoming more easily usable in field studies and at least provides information on current smoking and will help reduce slightly exposure misclassification. Almost 75% of the studies included in this me ta-analysis did not adjust for ETS but studies dealing with coal smoke exposure and with ETS adjusted (OR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.13, 1.91) had lower pooled effect sizes compared to those where ETS was not adjusted for (OR = 1.74, 95% CI 1.60, 1.89). Only one study out of 8 relate d to biomass smoke exposure adjusted for ETS and had effect size higher than the other that were not adjusted for ETS. Thus, ambiguity regarding the combined effect of smoking, combustion products of solid fuel and ETS exposure still prevails and future studies need to address this issue. There is evidence from occupational studies that sm oking and some occupational ex posures (e.g. asbestos, PAHs) have a multiplicative rather than simply an a dditive effect on lung can cer risk [106, 107] and it is therefore possible that such a potentiating e ffect may be seen with respect to smoke from solid fuel burning, especially that from coal. Most of the cooking in developing countries is done by women who are more likely to be exposed to indoor air pollution than men. The pool ed effect size shows that the risk of lung cancer is greater in women (OR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.54, 2.12) compared to men (OR = 1.16, 95% CI 0.79, 1.69), similar to that reported in a limited earli er meta-analysis [108] for women only (OR = 1.83, 95% CI 0.62, 5.41). 27 There may be an effect on cell type as the pooled effect size for squamous cell carcinoma (OR = 3.58, 95% CI 1.58, 8.12) was greatest followed by adeno-carcinoma (OR = 2.33, 95% CI 1.72, 3.17) and unspecified lung cancer type (OR = 1.57, 95% CI 1.38, 1.80). Squamous cell lung cancer is more commonly associated with cigarette smoking [109] although reported series of lung cancers have recently shown an increase in the proportion of adeno-carcinomas which is thought not to be simply an issue of changes in classifi cation/grading [110]. Indoor air pollution from other sou rces and associated health effects There are number of other sources that contri bute to the worsening of indoor air pollution in developing countries and may t hus contribute to ill-health. Cooking oil fume Cooking emissions Cooking is the treatment of food under heat. High temperature initiates volatilisation as well as a number of chemical reacti ons in the food ingredients, generally involving decomposition of lipids and amino acids [111]. The resulti ng emissions have been found to contain PM [112], volatile organic compounds (VOCs) [ 113] and other including PAHs [114] and heterocyclic amines [115] , some of which are potent mutagens and carcinogens. The types and levels of po llutants in cooking em issions are highly heterogeneous and depend on food ingredients [ 116-119]. For example, beef steak fried with margarine generated significantly higher levels of PM and aldehydes than when rapeseed oil, olive oil or soybean oil was used under the sa me cooking procedures [116]. On the other hand, Chiang and colleagues analysed emi ssion samples in Taiwan and reported non- significant variations of levels of PAHs [118] and aromatic amines [119] using different 28 types of cooking oil. In a controlled environment, Fullana et al. reported higher levels of acetaldehyde and acrolein emissions from heated canola oil and olive oil and suggested this might be related to their difference in fatty acid composition, where canola oil contains a higher proportion of linolenic acid and a small pr oportion of oleic acid than that in olive oil [117]. The same report also provided evidence th at the levels of po llutants are positively correlated with heating time and temperature [117]. Not surprisingly, different methods of cooking, such as frying (pan-, stir-, deep-fryin g), grilling, baking, can a ffect the levels of emission. For instance, when st ir-frying meat the concentrat ion of benzo[a]pyrene (2.64 \u00b5g/100 m3) can be 4 times as high as that when it was boiled (0.65 \u00b5g/100 m3) [120]. Chinese cooking appears to be of particul ar concern because the techniques involved generally require high temperatur e cooking with oil, such as in stir-frying and deep-frying. This is supported by a study in Taiwan, which found the annual rate of PAH emission was highest from Chinese restaurants compared with Western, fast food and Japanese restaurants, after taking into account of a number of factors including cooking oil consumption and cooking methods [121]. A study in Singapore compared the concentrations of PM 2.5 and PAHs in three ethnic food stalls and found the levels both pollutants to be highest in Malay, followed by Chinese and Indian stalls. The differe nce in the levels could be explained by the frying processes predominantly used at the Mala y (deep-frying) and the Chinese (stir-frying) stalls, whereas simmering (at lower temperature) was mostly used at the Indian stall [122]. Respiratory effects Compared to the wealth of knowledge on the resp iratory effects of biomass and solid fuels, far fewer studies have been dedicated to c ooking related emissions. Of those that did, the majority focused on lung cancer. A recent m onograph from IARC identified 17 case-control 29 studies exploring the associati on between exposure to cooking emissions and lung cancer and all were conducted exclusively in the Chin ese population [103]. Am ong these 17 studies, only four allowed the cooking-rela ted effects to be distinguished from those related to fuels [123-126]. In a group of non-smoking women in Hong Kong, Yu et al. found an escalating dose-response relationship between cumulativ e exposure (frequency a nd duration, in dish- years) and lung cancer risk, w ith a relative risk of a bout 3 for 101-150 and 150-200 dish- years exposure, and over 8 for >200 dish-years (referent exposure being 50 dish-years) [124]. In the two studies from Shanghai, those women who stir-f ried most frequently were 2.6 [126] and 2.3 times [123], respectively as like ly to have lung cancer compared with those who performed least often. Similarly the study in Gansu reported a relati ve risk of 2.2 [125]. These findings might explain the observed high non-smoking lung can cer incidence in Chinese women, which could be attributed to their high cumulative exposure to cooking emissions. However, confounding by cooking fuel could not be ruled out because of the history of using biomass or solid fuels in the st udy populations in the latt er three studies. In addition, recall and other forms of bias that ar e found in case-controls could be operating and contributed to the positive findings in some of these studies. Therefore, the causal relationship has not yet b een totally confirmed. There are few data on respiratory diseases othe r than lung cancer and none were derived from developing countries. A survey of 239 kitchen workers from 67 restaurants and found a four- fold and two-fold increase in risk of dyspnoea for females and males respectively compared with the controls [127]. However, the results could have been confounded by combustion products although relatively clean fuel (gas) wa s used in these restaurants. Assessing the possibility of acute responses, the lung func tion of 12 healthy volunteers were monitored over 30 a 24-hour period with and wit hout exposure to cooking fumes for two and four hour but found no significant changes in spirometry [128]. Burning of incense sticks Incense is regularly burnt in homes and offi ces for religious or ceremonial rituals and fragrance, particularly in de veloping countries. Incense is available in various forms including sticks, joss sticks, cones, coils, pow der, rope, rocks/charcoal, and smudge bundles. The substances widely used to produce incense are resins (such as frankincense and myrrh), spices, aromatic wood and bark, herb seeds, ro ots, flowers, essential oils, and synthetic substitute chemicals used in th e perfume industry [129] . Burning of incense releases different air pollutants such as PM, VOCs, carbonyl compounds, CO, nitrogen oxides, methane, non- methane sulphate, sodium, a mmonium and potassium ions) depending on the types of incense sticks and aroma used, the concentration bei ng much higher during the peak burning time of incense sticks [129-131]. The types of compounds present in the smoke released after burning incense suggest that they can cause number of acute and chronic health impacts. Although number of studies have suggest ed that smoke released from burning can cause respiratory health effects [132, 133], lung can cer [134-136], dermatological a llergic reactions be mutagenic and or genotoxic [137-139], the ev idence is inconsistent, with some studies finding inverse relationships for l ung cancer [140, 141] and COPD[142]. Burning of mosquito coil Annually, 45 to 50 billion mosquito coils are used by approximately 2 billion people worldwide [143], particularly in rural and se mi-rural communities of developing countries to prevent from mosquito bites. Liu et al. estimated that burning a mosquito coil can release mass concentration of PM 2.5 equivalent to burning of 75- 137 cigarettes depending upon the 31 types of base material used to make the mos quito coil and release formaldehyde equivalent to 51 cigarettes [144]. The smoke released fr om burning mosquito coil contains carcinogenic PAHs developing countries tend to burn mosqu ito coils during the summer nights and are therefore regularly expo sed to the smokes released for about 6-8 hours daily. Inhalation of the smoke has been reported to cause breathing difficulties, eye irritati on, bronchial irritation, itching, cough and as thma [144, 146, 147]. 32 Table 3: Research priorities on health effects/ exposure/ interventions of solid fuel smoke (adapted from [20]) Research Priorities Sub-groups Types of studies Health effects Basic studies Genetic susceptibility to various health effects Comparative studies on exposure to solid fuel smoke, tobacco smoke, passive smoking and traffic pollutions Studies on different types of health outcomes associated w ith exposure to solid fuel smoke but with little evidence Epidemiological studies Relationship between exposure and health outcomes Different health outcomes such as cervical cancer, visual impairment, lung growth in children, asthma in children Studies on acute health effects of exposure to solid fuel smoke Dose-response curve of health effects Studies on toxicity of fuel types Studies on health effects of other contributor to indoor air pollution (oil mist, deep frying, mosquito coil, etc.) Clinical Mechanisms of health outcomes related to solid fuel smoke Characterisation and early di agnosis of health outcomes Histopathological differences between inhalation of biomass and tobacco smoke Exposures Measurements Standardisation of cross-sectional and longitudinal monitoring of exposure Better data and more focussed on personal monitoring of exposure Modelling of personal exposure to better estimate the exposure data Monitoring of intervention of improved cookstoves in terms of exposure and their performance in the long-term Equipment Research and development on types of equipment such as cost, size, weight, power supply and resistance to extreme conditions for developing countries Interventions Improved cookstoves Types of stoves (multiple stoves, multiple fuel scenario s, multiple types of food cooked and different cooking practices) New biomass stove technology better combustion and efficiency and less pollutants emissions Social intervention Impact of massive educational programs on raising the awar eness of health effects of exposure to biomass smoke Acceptance of health interv entions/health promotions Resistance to stove/health intervention programs Fuel types Research on inexpensive but cleaner fuel types or source of heat such as production of briquettes and charcoal from agricultural wastes Effects Impact of improved cookstoves programs on the health outcomes 33 Conclusion The available evidence suggest s that despite heterogeneity among published studies there is sufficient evidence and consiste ncy among published studies to conclude that exposure to solid fuel smoke is a risk factor to COPD in adults and pneumonia in children particularly those less than 5 years of age. Although th e field has been hampered by methodological weaknesses, such as exposure not being meas ured directly and in adequate accounting of possible confounding factors, the overa ll data is sufficient to be sure that the effects size for COPD is around a three-fold risk for those expos ed and around a two-fold risk for ALRI in children. The available evidence also suggests that exposu re to coal smoke is a risk factor to lung cancer whereas the evidence from biomass smok e exposure on lung cancer is not conclusive. As for asthma, there remains uncertainty as to whether biomass smoke does increase the risk of developing asthma in childhood and tight er methodological studies are needed to determine any true causal asso ciation. While ther e is limited information suggesting that deep pan frying, using incense and mosquito co il are risk factors to respiratory problems, these risk factors should be rega rded as suggestive only at this stage and need to be explored further (Table 3).34 References 1.
