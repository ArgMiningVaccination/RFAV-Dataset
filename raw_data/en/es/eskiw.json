This outbreak of pandemic Covid-19 all over the world has disturbed the political, social, economic, religious and financial structures of the whole world. There are currently no approved medications or vaccines that can cure or prevent the resulting illness, COVID-19. At present, prevention is the best measure.Various research institutes and all available systems of medicine around the world, trying hard to work out the possible ways to fight with this dreadful issue. We belong to Ayurveda - \"The great science of life\". Ayurveda explains the concept of Immunity to prevent the diseases and to fight with the disease causing pathogens when a person get encountered with it, also the recovery of body and mind after coming in contact with them.The preventive aspect of our immunity function is majorly related to the overall balance of body functions of systems, tissues, digestion, and elimination. Hence as per Ayurveda if one has strong immune system, will be able to prevent the disease and can fight any pathogen. RECOMMENDED SAFETY MEASURES: FIRST THING IS TO MAINTAIN PROPER HYGIENE - Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water or with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. - Keep your hands and fingers away from your eyes, nose, and mouth. - Avoid close contact with people who are infected. - Stay at home, maintain social distancing. - Separate yourself from other people, who have any of above said symptoms. - Wear a Facemask when around other people. - Cover your coughs and sneezes with tissue paper or cloth. - Avoid sharing personal household items. - Clean all \"high-touch\" surfaces everyday with alcohol based cleaner or soap. HERBAL MEDICINES For the symptomatic relief for an infected person we recommend products as follow: FLUCOMUNE - Is the most potent supplement to boost your immunity. Along with Flucomune we advise to take Ashwagandha DS - for strength and Rx Cold\u2014 to deal with the respiratory symptoms. Also light diet, more fluids (warm water) and plenty of rest helps to fight with symptoms. TO BUILD A STRONG IMMUNE SYSTEM We recommend everyone to have Flucomune, for building up strong immunity to stay protected against the virus infection. FLUCOMUNE: have strong immune-supportive. ADHATODA VASICA Develops immunity against infections and have antimicrobial activity. OCIMUM SANCTUM Ocimum Sanctum is one of the most important medicinal plants mentioned in Ayurvedic literature for its antibacterial and antiviral properties. It is an very potent agent for effective control of viral infections. TINOSPORA CORDIFOLIA It is widely used in Ayurveda since ages for the treatment of various infectious diseases and is also proven to be an immune system modulator. GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA Glycyrrhiza Glabra contain glycyrrhizin, as antioxidant, antiviral, anti-infective and anti-inflammatory properties. It have a positive effect on the treatment of high-prevalence diseases related to immune system. HALDI Haldi as a potent modulator of the immune system also has anti - inflammatory / antibiotic like activity. BAHEDA Baheda has astringent qualities and is best known for its use in treating all cough cold related problems, immunity and digestive problems. TRIKATU Trikatu for its digestive support, thereby enhancing the bio availability of herbal compounds and nutrients in the digestive tract. MODE OF ACTION: All the herbs in the Flucomune's formulation makes it very potent against the viral and bacterial infections and makes it (Flucomune) a perfect RASAYANA to strengthen and nourishing the immune system. NOTE: All the herbs in Flucomune are immunity enhancer and their synergistic combination in a particular ratio along with best bioavailability, is the strength of this formulation. People ask that they are already taking rasayana herbs (immunity enhancer) like Amla ,Guduchi , Tulsi - Haldi etc then \" Why Flucomune \"? There is no doubt that these herbs have immunity boosting potential. But there are few factors which come to play, when we talk efficacy of medicine like: What is the dosage per day? Is the herb enough potent? What is the quality of herb? Do you know, it is not contaminated with heavy metals? What is the right Anupan? Processing of herb can change its bioavailability. Among all above dosage and potency of herbs are most important. \"Because here we are not talking about the any common cold, cough rhinitis or bronchitis etc which one can manage with Tulsi tea, zinger -honey, having warm water or zinger tea etc. Here we are talking about a life threatening viral infection, so we need strong immunity enhancer like Flucomune. SUGGESTED USES For an healthy individual to boost immunity - Flucomune-1 Tablet twice or Thrice a day. For a person with symptoms we recommend - Flucomune- 2 Tablets Twice or Thrice a day.
