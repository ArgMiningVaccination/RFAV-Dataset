OB/GYNs can: Communicate with patients about COVID -19 vaccination in ways that make them more likely to get vaccinated. Learn about becoming a COVID -19 immunization administrator or vaccinator, which follows a different process than other immunizations. Start thinking about COVID -19 vaccination as a potentially long -term element of clinical practice. \"More than 80% of people say they would turn to their doctor or to another health care professional who cares for them to actually make a decision about whether or not they should get a vaccine.\" -Vice Admiral Vivek H. Murthy, MD, MPH, U.S. Surgeon General, 2021 ACOG Annual Clinical and Scientific Meeting20 83% say the most trusted source of COVID- 19 vaccine information is their own doctor.21 ObstetGynecol July 2021;138: e16- 21 Article LinkACOG Committee Opinion #829 OB/GYNs have an ethical obligation to promote protection from infectious diseases among their patients and society in general. oKnowledgeable about current clinical guidelines regarding vaccines, including indications, benefits, and risks Counsel patients about vaccination in an evidence -based manner that allows patients to make an informed decision. OB/GYNs should recommend routine vaccination in accordance with CDC and ACOG guidelines. 22 Article LinkACOG Committee Opinion #829 If a patient continues to be unsure after counseling, OB/GYNs should inquire about the reasons for this hesitation and help to address questions and concerns. oIf the patient declines, informed refusal should be respected. oDocument discussion in medical record. oAt subsequent visits, address ongoing questions and offer vaccination again if the patient seems amenable. Counsel pregnant and lactating patients about the safety and efficacy and recommend needed vaccines. OB/GYNs have an ethical obligation to be vaccinated unless they have a recognized medical contraindication. 23 Article Link24Safety & Efficacy and Tips for Effective Conversations with Family Planning clients LaTanya Hines, MD, FACOG Assistant Clinical Professor of OB-GYN, Kaiser Permanente Bernard J. Tyson School of Medicine Assistant PIC (Physician in Charge), Baldwin Hills, Crenshaw Medical Offices #ThisIsOurShot Health Care Hero Hierarchy of Information Needs Safety: How will the vaccine affect me? What side effects can I expect? Efficacy: Do the vaccines work? If I already had COVID -19, why do I need to get the vaccine? Development Process: How were the vaccines developed so quickly? Access : Do I need insurance? 25As those undecided navigate the decision-making process, safety is the most important consideration. Key Messages for COVID-19 Vaccine Efficacy & Safety During Pregnancy COVID -19 vaccines during pregnancy is effective and safe Does not increase risk of miscarriages or adverse pregnancy outcomes Prevents hospitalizations and severe disease in pregnancy Has the same side effect profile as non- pregnant persons Protective antibodies pass through the placenta and breastmilk Mounts a better response than natural infection 26 COVID-19 Vaccines & Pregnancy 27Getting COVID -19 during pregnancy increases your risk of:ICU admission 6-fold Intubation 14-fold Death 15-fold A person who gets COVID- 19 during pregnancy is more likely that a non- pregnant person to have:ICU admission Death 1.7-fold Getting COVID -19 you more likely to have pregnancy- complications:Preeclampsia 4-fold Preterm birth 4-fold Gestational diabetes 2-fold Low birth weight 2-fold How do we know that vaccines are safe in pregnancy? Multiple tracking mechanisms in place, and decades of vaccine safety data Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS): A long -standing mechanism to track all vaccine adverse events V-Safe: COVID -specific tracking mechanism o160,000 pregnant persons who received COVID -19 vaccine in pregnancy o5,000 enrolled in pregnancy registry Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD): Network of health systems who share vaccine data 28 \"COVID- 19 vaccines are not safe for pregnant women.\" Available data shows vaccination during pregnancy has been safe and effective among the women who have received a COVID -19 vaccine in the U.S To date, there has been no connection to any increased risk of complications after getting a COVID -19 vaccine during pregnancy. Getting infected with SARS -CoV -2 during pregnancy is much higher than any risk associated with COVID -19 vaccination. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal -Fetal Medicine recommend COVID- 19 vaccination for pregnant and breastfeeding women.Common Concerns Among Family Planning Clients 29Common Concerns Among Family Planning Clients \"COVID- 19 vaccines cross the placenta.\" When a vaccine is administered, it works in the muscle where the vaccine is given \u2014It does not cross to the baby directly. The body then recognizes the vaccine and generates a response in the form of antibodies, which cross the placenta via the bloodstream to the baby or enter the breast and are passed on to baby through breastmilk. This process is not unique to COVID -19 vaccines. Influenza and pertussis (whooping cough) are recommended vaccines during pregnancy. Vaccination during pregnancy has been found to be very effective for protecting newborns from these diseases. 30\"Breastfeeding women should wait to get a COVID -19 vaccine.\" Breastfeeding women can get a COVID -19 vaccine and still breastfeed if they have already been vaccinated. According to research about vaccination during pregnancy , protective antibodies stimulated by the vaccine can be passed through breastmilk and help protect a baby from harmful viruses.Common Concerns Among Family Planning Clients 31\"The vaccine causes infertility\" Many medical studies have shown no differences in pregnancy success rates in people who are vaccinated versus people who have not received the vaccine. Over 170,000 pregnant women have been monitored by the CDC v -safe system with no concerns about their pregnancies. A major study of over 35,000 pregnant women showed that the COVID -19 vaccine \" did not show obvious safety signals among pregnant persons who received mRNA COVID -19 vaccines.\"Common Concerns Among Family Planning Clients 32\"COVID- 19 vaccines can make pregnant women sick. \" Pregnant women have not reported different side effects from non -pregnant individuals after getting a COVID -19 vaccine. During pregnancy, women are more vulnerable to infections and viruses due to changes to their immune system. They tend to get sicker than people who are not pregnant. This is the case for influenza and also COVID -19.Common Concerns Among Family Planning Clients 33\"I'm worried about long- term effects of the vaccine\" Historically, adverse effects of all vaccines almost always happen within 6 weeks of receiving a vaccine dose. Billions of people have received COVID 19 vaccines with no \"long term\" side effects noted (after almost a year and more than a year for trial participants). \"Long haul COVID\" has been described extensively in adults and children but studies of prevalence in children are ongoing. If families are worried about long term effects, the vaccine is far safer than the effects of COVID disease.Common Concerns Among Family Planning Clients 343-5-3 Methodology 353 Steps Post- Conversations5 Key Messages 3 Steps to Initiating Conversations 3 Steps to Initiating Conversations with the Vaccine Curious1.
