Standard medicine refers to treatments that have been tested in science studies and found to work. These have been approved by the FDA. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) are different from standard medicine. They include these 2 types of therapy: - Complementary medicine. This is any form of therapy used with standard medicine. These types of therapy may be used to ease symptoms. They may improve quality of life. They may ease side effects caused by standard treatment. For example, using guided imagery may help pain relief during cancer treatment. - Alternative medicine. This is another approach to healing. It's also called alternative therapy. This is treatment used instead of standard medicine. These are often not tested in science studies or proven to work. Talk with your healthcare provider before using alternative medicine. It can delay the use of proven methods. Or it may cause you harm. What are the different types of CAM? There are many types of complementary and alternative medicine. Some of them overlap in how they work.

This is a practice that combines alternative and standard medicine. Body Touch has been used in medicine since the early days of medical care. Healing by touch is based on the idea that illness or injury in 1 part of the body can affect all parts of the body. These methods use hands-on therapy: - Chiropractic - Massage - Body movement - Tai chi - Yoga Diet and herbs A healthy diet can include lean meats, fruits, vegetables, and grains. But our diets often have lots of unhealthy fats, oils, processed foods, and simple carbohydrates. Both nutritional excess and deficiency are problems. Both can lead to long-term (chronic) diseases. Many dietary and herbal treatments try to balance the body's nutritional well-being. These treatments include: External energy This therapy uses external forces (energies) from objects or other sources to affect a person's health. One type of external energy therapy is electromagnetic therapy. Mind Studies have found that people heal better if they have good emotional and mental health.
