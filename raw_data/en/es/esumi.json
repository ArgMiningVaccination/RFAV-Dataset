Babineau, MD President and Chief Executive Ocer Lifespan Lawrence A. Aubin, Sr. Chairman Lifespan Board of Directors Message from the President and Chief Executive Ocer and the Chairman of the Board Fiscal year 2015 was another year of significant change in health care, not only for Lifespan but for hospitals and health systems across the country. The pace and degree of change remains unprecedented. Three years ago, we began laying the foundation to reorganize and center care around each patient's needs, when we selected and started building a new electronic health record system. The conversion to that system was a tremendous achievement that included all doctors, clinicians and employees across the Lifespan system. In March of 2015 our new EHR was launched throughout Lifespan, better positioning us to partner with other organ - izations, to organize our care to not only meet but exceed our patients' expectations, and to find innovative ways to benefit patients. Last year saw continued focus on our physician partners\u2014particularly with the growth of Lifespan Physician Group and our primary care IPA. We also continued to advance new payment models with various partners as we continue to move away from fee for service towards more value-based reimbursement. We continued to formalize partnerships with like-minded organizations that share our values of patient-centered, high value care. And we continued to recruit world-class physician and executive talent from around the country to help us lead Lifespan into the next decade. As the leading health care system in the state and the region, we take our responsibility to help transform the health care delivery system seriously. We strongly endorse the move to value-based care, even as we are challenged to transform a business model that has been built over the last several decades in an excruciatingly short period of time. We strongly endorse putting the patient at the center of everything we do. And we absolutely recognize that our system is only as good as the people that come here to work each and every day. Lifespan includes thousands of outstanding and committed employees and caregivers, and they deserve our gratitude for their commitment to patients and to each other. Timothy J. Babineau, MD President and Chief Executive Officer Lifespan Lawrence A. Aubin, Sr. Chairman Lifespan Board of Directors 4The Lifespan system comprises teaching hospitals, a community hospital, ambulatory care centers, and mental health services for the state of Rhode Island and its surrounding communities. Rhode Island Hospital and its Hasbro Children's Hospital, The Miriam Hospital, and Bradley Hospital together form Lifespan's academic medical center, and Rhode Island Hospital is the principal teaching hospital of The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University. In addition, Newport Hospital serves a growing community's health care needs, and Gateway Healthcare provides a diverse array of outpatient mental health care throughout the state of Rhode Island. Lifespan's three teaching hospitals - Rhode Island Hospital and its Hasbro Children's Hospital, The Miriam Hospital, and Bradley Hospital - are closely affiliated with The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University and train about 600 residents and fellows every year in more than 70 programs. An additional 200 residents and fellows who are based at other academic med - ical institutions also do their specialty training at our hospitals. These three teaching hospitals receive more than $80 million in research funding annually from the National Institutes of Health. Lifespan and its affiliates are charitable organizations and rely on community and institutional support for programs and services.

Each year it provides $1.5 million of free care to Rhode Islanders in need through its residential, outpatient and community-based programs. Gateway's affiliates include The Autism Project, Capital City Community Centers, and FRIENDS WAY. Gateway Healthcare joined the Lifespan system in 2013. Visit www.gatewayhealth.org for more information. Gateway Healthcare Newport Hospital Richard Leclerc President Crista Durand President Thomas McGue, MD Vice President Orla Brandos, DNP, MBA, MSN, RN, CPHQ, NEA-BC Vice President Chief Nursing Officer 14 The Comprehensive Spine Center opened at Rhode Island Hos- pital in a newly renovated space on the first floor of the George Building, representing a consolidation of spine services at one convenient location. This new center offers the most complete range of advanced spine care services in the region, including outpatient interventional pain management, spine-specific physical evaluations, interventional procedures, minimally invasive and other surgical techniques, and physical and occupational therapy. Patients benefit from the combined expertise of a multidis- ciplinary team, who work together toward the goal of long-term pain management and improvement in each patient's function and quality of life. The team could include pain medicine physi- cians, neurosurgeons, neurologists, interventional radiologists, orthopedists and physical and occupational therapists, and other specialty-trained providers. If surgery is the best option, our patients can be treated by the most highly experienced neurosurgeons in the region, whose skill and reputation draw patients from across New England and the nation, as well as from outside the United States. Our location within the region's largest acute care hospital and academic medical center gives patients access to the most advanced technology. And as part of the department ofneurosurgery, the center is also part of the Norman Prince Neurosciences Institute (NPNI), which is dedicated to engaging in world-class research in the neurosciences. Rhode Island Hospital opened a new inpatient rehabilitation unit on the seventh floor of the main building. The unit provides specialized rehabilitative therapy for patients recovering from serious neurological, orthopedic, or musculoskeletal impairment and from vascular disease or injury. Therapists work closely with a patient's physicians to ensure that the rehabilitation process is fully integrated into each patient's total care plan throughout treatment, rehabilitation and recovery. The multidisciplinary team may include a physiatrist, physician specialists, registered nurses, certified nursing assistants, physical and occupational therapists, speech language pathologists, a social worker, a dieti- tian, and a neuropsychologist. Rehabilitation begins immediately after a patient is released from a critical care unit or the dedi- cated stroke unit, and the patient is able to remain in one facility for the duration of their recovery, ensuring continuity of care. Rhode Island Hospital's department of ophthalmology welcomed a board-certified neuro-ophthalmologist, who will treat patients who experience visual problems due to disease of or injury to the brain or optic nerve, resulting from trauma, tumors, infections, inflammation or toxicity.Clinical Services 13 To meet the ever growing and changing needs of the commu - nities we serve, Lifespan is always augmenting and improving the range of care we provide. During fiscal year 2015, Lifespan opened new clinics and services throughout the region, and expanded services at existing locations. This past year also saw the addition of some of the most current and innovative treat - ments and advanced technology. Rhode Island Hospital also added new cutting-edge technologies this year. The hospital opened a new Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Center at the West River Center in Provi- dence. Transcranial magnetic stimulation provides patients an innovative and noninvasive treatment option for major depression, while avoiding the possible side effects associated with antide - pressant medication. The Comprehensive Cancer Center's radia - tion oncology department added two new sophisticated treatment modalities: Align RT and BrainLab. Align RT is a three-dimensional, video-based, image-guided radiation therapy th at tracks a patient's movements to ensure the patient is correctly positioned to receive treatment. The technology uses optical surface tracking during breath-hold radiation techniques so there are no markers on the skin, no discomfort, and patients do not receive unnecessary radiation. And BrainLab works with existing technologies to form a powerful radiosurgery system that features very high dose delivery rates, so treatments can be delivered rapidly, while avoiding harm to nearby healthy tissue. Lifespan continued to make strides in efforts to fully inte - grate mental health and substance abuse treatment with primary medical services, making mental health care services even more accessible. Lifespan Outpatient Psychiatry and Urgent Care opened a new clinic in Lifespan's Ambulatory Care Center in East Greenwich, bringing together Gateway Healthcare's trained behavioral health professionals with other Lifespan clinicians to provide prompt urgent care services for behavioral health needs, in addition to offering outpatient appointments. The broad range of medical and psychotherapy treatments available include medication management, individual psychotherapy, group therapy, couples and marital therapy, and family therapy. This past year, Lifespan physicians also broke new ground in offering advanced surgical techniques. Rhode Island Hospital opened its second endovascular hybrid operating suite. The suite's unique design enables vascular surgeons to perform both traditional open and catheter-based surgeries simultaneously, translating to safer, less invasive procedures, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery times for patients. At The Miriam Hospital, the Minimally Invasive Urology Institute (MIUI) added two new highly effective treatment options. UroLift, one of the newest surgical treatments available for men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), is an outpatient procedure that relieves symptoms of BPH by restoring urinary function. The Miriam Hospital is also now the only hospital in the state to offer blue light cystoscopy to diagnose and treat tumors in the bladder. Surgeons with the MIUI use an optical imaging agent that binds to cancerous areas and highlights them, making them visible to the eye. The benefits of blue light cystoscopy include better visibility of the tumor, increased chance of complete removal, and decreased rates of tumor recurrence. Hasbro Children's Hospital has the only pediatric urology program in Rhode Island that offers laparoscopic and robotic surgery for urologic procedures, including pyeloplasty for ureteropelvic junction obstruction, vesicoureteral reflux, and duplicated systems. The non-invasive procedures provide the benefit of shorter hospital stays and reduced recovery time, as well as less scarring and pain. Fiscal year 2015 also afforded the opportunity to open new clinics and programs that allow Lifespan to bring more highly specialized care to local communities, providing many patients the comfort and convenience of treatment close to home. Several of the new clinics and programs also focus on identifying disease at the earliest stage possible, using new technologies to diagnose illness before symptoms are evident. The Cardiovascular Institute at Rhode Island, The Miriam and Newport hospitals added a cardio-oncologist to its staff to work with patients and their oncology care teams to prevent cardiac toxicities associated with cancer therapy and to treat toxicities if they occur. The field of cardio-oncology developed in response to emerging data that indicates that both traditional and targeted cancer treatments can affect the heart. The Cardio - vascular Institute's Genetics Clinic at Rhode Island Hospital became the first in the state to offer evaluation and genetic counseling for cardiac conditions. Approximately 20 to 40 percent of common heart problems are inherited. Early diagnosis and treatment of inherited cardiac conditions via genetic testing and family screening can prevent catastrophic events and significantly improve and prolong a patient's life. The Comprehensive Cancer Center opened the Lung Can - cer Screening Clinic at Rhode Island and The Miriam hospitals and will soon open the clinic at Newport Hospital. Early and accurate diagnosis is essential for positive outcomes in the treat- ment of lung cancer. To help begin treatment as soon as possible, the clinic uses the most advanced diagnostic imaging technology to accurately interpret low-dose CT scans for people at a higher than normal risk for developing lung cancer.The Women's Medicine Collaborative introduced a program that offers comprehensive evaluations and treatment plans for women at higher than normal risk of developing breast cancer. This includes women with a family history or fibrocystic breasts with multiple prior biopsies, especially women who have had precancerous changes but have not been diagnosed with breast cancer. Working with the Women's Medicine Collaborative's genetics, gynecologic oncology, and cancer survivorship pro - grams, the new program brings together a team of specialists to evaluate a woman's lifetime risk for developing breast cancer. The Women's Medicine Collaborative also established a program for pelvic floor disorders. At least one in four women experience the symptoms of a pelvic floor disorder at some point in life. Common causes for pelvic floor disorders are child - birth, obesity, hysterectomy, aging, and activities that increase pressure on the abdomen, resulting in weakness of or injury to the ligaments, connective tissue, and muscles of the pelvis. Symptoms include incontinence, constipation and pelvic pain, 16 15 among others. Pelvic floor disorders are often very difficult to talk about. The Women's Medicine Collaborative program offers a multidisciplinary team of clinicians who treat these symptoms with expertise and sensitivity. The team includes a gastroenterologist, gynecologists, a colorectal surgeon, a clinical dietitian, behavioral medicine professionals and physical thera - pists who work collaboratively to meet patients' needs and improve their quality of life. The incidence of tick-borne diseases, particularly Lyme disease, has risen dramatically in the Northeast over the past decade, and reported cases of Lyme disease in Rhode Island alone rose fourfold over the past six years. To address this grow - ing health problem, Lifespan opened the Lifespan Lyme Disease Center at Newport Hospital. The first of its kind in the state, the center unites academic and clinical infectious diseases experts who are highly experienced in treating patients with acute Lyme disease, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis and other tick-borne diseases, with particular expertise with patients who are coping with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, sometimes called chronic Lyme disease. In collaboration with specialists in neurol- ogy, rheumatology and other fields, the multidisciplinary center offers an innovative, multi-faceted approach to treatment that includes diagnosis and testing, management of symptoms, and customized treatment plans that include carefully evaluated antibiotic therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, nutrition consultation, and complementary therapies such as yoga and acupuncture. Lifespan also expanded a number of existing programs, allowing its affiliates to provide services to more people in the region. Bradley Hospital's Center for Autism and Developmental Disabilities (CADD) opened a partial hospitalization program. The first of its kind in the nation, the highly specialized day treatment program is for children and adolescents ages 5 to 18 who have autism or developmental disabilities with a co-existing emotional or behavioral disorder. The primary goal of the CADD partial hospitalization program is to help children and adolescents remain safely at home while they and their families work on clinical, emotional, and behavioral problems. Bradley Schools opened another new location\u2014the first Bradley School in Connecticut. The New London Regional makes Bradley Schools' innovative model and decades of experience available to Connecticut families. The newly renovated building accommo - dates up to seven classrooms, and the property includesa play - ground and a playing field. Newport Hospital re-launched or expanded several service lines, including women's health, physiatry, pulmonary medicine, general surgery, behavioral health and family medicine. The hos- pital added more than 20 new physicians and nurse practitioners this year, including two obstetrician/gynecologists and a nurse midwife; four family medicine physicians and two family medi- cine nurse practitioners; two pulmonologists; two physiatrists; and three general surgeons. Gateway Healthcare expanded its reach in providing men - tal health care through the opening of the 18-bed Caritas Acute Residential Services Program in Cranston, the only facility in Rhode Island that provides treatment for children ages 12 to 17 who have both mental health and substance abuse problems. Gateway Healthcare's FRIEND's Way, Rhode Island's only child bereavement center, provided support, assistance, and grief intervention services to more than 200 families.Rhode Island Hospital opened its second endovascular hybrid operating suite. The suite's unique design enables vascular surgeons to perform both traditional open and catheter-based surgeries simultaneously, translating to safer, less invasive procedures, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery times for patients. 17 18 20 19 In 2015, Lifespan's operational excellence department, OpX, in collaboration with risk management and patient safety, opti- mized workflows in SafetyNet - the incident reporting system we selected three years ago - to facilitate the review and investi- gation of events and potential unsafe conditions entered in the system. SafetyNet enhances patient safety by enabling us to use the data entered in the system to identify and correct potential causes of problems before they occur, so we can correct them at their source and prevent patient harm. Many people are involved in the care of each patient: nurses, physicians, lab technologists, radiology technologists, therapists and more, so communication and accurate documen - tation are crucial to the safety of every patient. LifeChart, Lifes- pan's new Epic-based electronic health record system, has added a powerful capability to monitor our performance on several quality and safety measures and pinpoint any opportunities for improvement, focusing on the present rather than reviewing data after a problem manifests itself. As a result, performance on key clinical outcome measures at Lifespan hospitals has improved since the LifeChart implementation. We also saw continued improvement across key quality focus areas as a result of system-wide quality realignment that began early in the fiscal year. The quality functions of Operational Excellence, Clinical Excellence, Patient Experience, Patient Safety, Accreditation & Regulatory Readiness, and OpX Informatics are now each overseen by a system director with responsibility for assigned functions across the system. This focused system view better enables us to organize our efforts around a specific area of quality and safety, and ensures we leverage and spread best prac - tices across the system. During 2015, 10 Lifespan Six Sigma certifications were awarded: eight Green Belts and two Black Belts. A new Lifespan Patient Experience Council was formed in 2015 as well, and it initially focused on key strategies for three distinct phases of LifeChart implementation: pre-go-live, go-live, and post-go-live. Subsequently, the council has worked to focus and align patient experience improvement efforts across the Lifespan system and has developed a plan to promote staff, physician and management engagement in efforts to improve service excellence and the patient experience. As we develop new Lifespan services and facilities, our OpX experts collaborate with key service leaders, physicians and staff, first to develop quality performance and measurement plans, and then partner with key stakeholders in each new area to identify and address opportunities. Our ongoing efforts to enhance quality and safety continue to bring sustainable success, and we will continue to strengthen our protocols with new technologies, by sharing best practices, and by continuously measuring our performance. Patient Safety and Quality of Care Lifespan is committed to providing care of the highest quality, emphasizing patient safety as its top priority. We involve employ - ees, sta, and physicians at all levels of the organization in quality and safety processes. We continuously monitor and evaluate our systems, procedures, and processes so we can identify and mitigate potential problems before they ever reach a patient. Ongoing cancer research at Rhode Island Hospital benefited from a five-year, $5.8 million grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to fund the third phase of research at the hospi- tal's Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) Center for Cancer Research Development (CCRD). The CCRD previously received two NIH grants of $8,617,015 and $10,853,821 for the first two phases of research activity, which worked to uncover the cellular and molecular pathways leading to cancer arising in the liver, intestine, pancreas and colon. The new grant will support the CCRD as it launches several pilot programs and focuses on sustaining its research programs beyond this third phase. The Division of Surgical Research at Rhode Island Hospi- tal successfully renewed funding for its trauma and inflamma - tion research training fellowship from the NIH. The $600,000 award will support clinician-scientists studying trauma-related diseases\u2014a leading cause of death and disability in the United States. The study of traumatic injury and inflammation, which initiate a wide variety of responses within the human body, can advance understanding of all types of diseases and reactions outside of normal conditions. HIV/AIDS is a leading cause of death in the world; approx - imately four million new infections occur each year. Researchersat The Miriam Hospital continue to be at the forefront of efforts to discover and employ ever more effective treatments for the disease, especially in developing nations where it is most prevalent. An infectious diseases physician at The Miriam Hospital and a biostatistics professor at Brown University's School of Public Health were awarded a $3.5 million grant from the NIH to fund HIV treatment optimization work, including opti- mizing the effectiveness of HIV treatment in areas of the world where resources are limited. The majority of HIV-infected patients live in developing countries, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and South and Southeast Asia, where HIV-infected patients have limited access to medication and treatment moni- toring options. The combination of limited treatment options and resource constraints elevates the risk of treatment failure. The goal of the project is to address these constraints and develop methods for better use of limited resources to improve HIV patient care in developing countries. The Miriam Hospital was also part of a research collabora - tion that has received a $20 million grant from the NIH, from which The Miriam Hospital received $1.2 million to study per- ceptibility, acceptability and adherence issues related to using microbicidal intravaginal rings to prevent the spread of AIDS.Groundbreaking Research Lifespan's research enterprises received approximately $80 mil - lion in fiscal year 2015 from external organizations, including the National Institutes of Health and many other sources, attesting to the innovation and importance of the academic and clinical research conducted at Lifespan. Our scientists and physicians excel at research in brain disorders, cancer, heart disease, and mental health and developmental disorders\u2014some of the nation's most common and most debilitating conditions. 22 21 And the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) at The Miriam Hospital received a $2.4 million grant renewal to support the hospital's continued efforts in research and new treatments for HIV and AIDS. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Diseases\u2014part of the National Institutes of Health\u2014awarded a $1.3 million research grant to The Miriam Hospital and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center to use advanced monitoring technology to examine behavioral, psychosocial and environ - mental predictors of weight loss following bariatric surgery. In this study, wristwatch-like sensor devices and smartphones will be used to measure factors such as eating and physical activity behavior, mood, hunger and cravings in approximately 100 bariatric surgery patients at The Miriam Hospital, as well as at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, a second data collection site for the study. Researchers will collect information about environmental factors, such as foods available to patients and support from family and friends, to assess which factors predict weight loss. At Hasbro Children's Hospital, the Injury Prevention Center conducted a research study that examined concussion standards and protocols in youth sports. The Centers for Dis- ease Control and Prevention estimates that of the estimated 7.7 million children and adolescents who participate in organ - ized sports each year, between 1.6 million and 3.8 million sus- tain sports-related concussions. To address this danger, Rhode Island passed the School and Youth Programs Concussion Act in July 2010, which outlines both mandatory and recommended provisions for managing student athletes with a suspected concussion. The law applies to Rhode Island Interscholastic League members. The Injury Prevention Center study assessed compliance with this law among high schools and community league organ - izations. It found that compliance with mandated provisions in youth sports concussion laws is high among high schools in the Rhode Island Interscholastic League, but that compliance with recommended concussion protocols is limited. In light of this finding, researchers urge the public to encourage schools and community sports organizations to follow all recommendations in the concussion law. A study conducted by researchers at Hasbro Children's Hospital, Boston Children's Hospital, Fairfax County Public Schools (in Fairfax, Virginia), and the University of Colorado School of Medicine has found that nationally mandated protec - tive eyewear results in a greater than threefold reduced risk of eye and orbital injuries in high school girls' field hockey players without increasing rates of concussion. The study examined injuries among high school field hockey players ages 14 to18 for two seasons prior to and two seasons following the National Federation of State High School Associations' implementation of a national mandate requiring the use of protective eyewear for all players. Researchers found that the incidence of eye and orbital injuries was significantly higher in states that did not comply with the mandate than in states that did comply. After imple - mentation of the mandate, severe eye and orbital injuries were reduced by 67 percent and severe or medically disqualifying head and face injuries were reduced by 70 percent. The results of the study support a policy change regarding mandatory protective eyewear in field hockey at all amateur levels, in both practice and competition. A Hasbro Children's Hospital researcher led a study that found children who were exposed to an adverse childhood experience (ACE) were more likely to develop asthma. Asthma is one of the most common chronic childhood conditions, currently affecting seven million, or 9.5 percent, of children in the United States. The researchers analyzed data from nearly 100,000 children and teens in the 2011-2012 National Survey of Children's Health and compared parent or guardian reports of a child having asthma to whether a child had experienced an ACE at home. An ACE is considered to have happened if the child had ever lived with a parent or guardian who experienced divorce, death, or incarcera - tion. An ACE could also include living with anyone who was mentally ill or suicidal, severely depressed for more than a couple of weeks, or had a problem with alcohol or drugs, or witnessing domestic violence. The findings showed that children exposed to one ACE had a 28 percent greater risk of developing asthma compared to those with no ACEs. These rates increase with each additional ACE, with children exposed to four ACEs having a 73 percent increase in reported asthma. The study, published in the Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, suggests that psychosocial factors may contribute to pediatric asthma. The lead researcher explains that psychosocial stressors activate the sympathetic nervous system, which controls our \"fight or flight\" responses to stressful situations. The increased activity of this system releases cortisol, a stress hormone that has been shown to affect the activity of immune cells. Occasional increases in these hormones are protective, but excessively high or prolonged exposures, such as those experienced by children exposed to ACEs, can be harmful. The study seeks to highlight the complex causes of asthma, enabling clinicians to better target preventive medications and other interventions. The Bradley Hasbro Children's Research Center received a $2 million grant to study the efficacy of a drug use intervention for court-involved, non-incarcerated girls who use illicit sub - stances. The study, funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, compares the gender-responsive program's effect on reducing drug use and sexual risk behaviors relative to other community-based services that girls are typically referred to by the court. The study will enroll 200 girls between the ages of 12 and 18 who are involved with the Rhode Island Family Court in either a gender-responsive drug use treatment program called VOICES, or into other community-based services. The research team will monitor both the short-term (three months) and long-term (12 months) effects of the program on the girls' drug and alcohol use, HIV/STD risk behaviors, psychiatric symptoms, and recidivism. Researchers hope that the findings from the study can imme - diately affect the way that practitioners help girls in the court system. The Women's Medicine Collaborative received a $2.7 million grant from the NIH to study the impact of sleep apnea and other sleep disturbances on placental function.The study will recruit women with obesity in the early weeks of preg - nancy who snore, and assess them for the presence of sleep apnea. Those with sleep apnea will be enrolled in a trial that will test the effect of a device used to treat the disorder on various markers secreted by the placenta. Researchers hope to determine whether treatment for sleep disorders benefits pregnancy-specific organs or outcomes. 24 23 Delivering health with care. In four succinct words, this is Lifes - pan's mission. And we fulfill that mission by striving at all times to ensure that our patients can have confidence in the expertise of our physicians and sta; the sophistication of our treatments and technology; and the breadth and quality of services we oer. Our determination to remain true to our mission is reflected in the many recognitions, awards and certifications that Lifespan and its aliates routinely receive. This past year we were honored with the following acknowledgments. Distinctions Newsweek , in conjunction with Castle Connolly Medical LTD, publisher of America's Top Doctors, included several Lifespan physicians on their list of the nation's Top Cancer Doctors 2015. William Cioffi, MD; David Wazer, MD, were named among the best cancer doctors. And Time magazine named \"Ebola Fighters\" as Persons of the Year 2015, including Rhode Island Hospital physicians Adam Levine, MD, and Michael Smit, MD. Dr. Levine was also invited to light a Hanukkah candle at the annual White House lighting ceremony. Newport Hospital and The Miriam Hospital were both recognized as top hospitals for 2015-2016 in Rhode Island and the Providence metro area by U.S. News & World Report. New - port Hospital was recognized for high performance in the areas of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart failure, and The Miriam Hospital for its high performance in gastroenterol- ogy, gastrointestinal surgery and geriatrics. Lifespan Pharmacy at Rhode Island Hospital earned the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (URAC) Specialty Pharmacy Accreditation, becoming the only URAC-accredited specialty pharmacy in Rhode Island and one of only six in New England. The pharmacy was recognized for its commitment to quality management, patient safety and monitoring, and 26 25 prescriber and consumer communications. Becoming a specialty pharmacy allows Lifespan Pharmacy to provide a high level of clinical care to patients with complex pharmaceutical needs for conditions such as cancer, hepatitis C, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and organ transplant. Rhode Island Hospital was recognized by The Joint Com - mission as a Disease-Specific Care Comprehensive Stroke Center (CSC), which means it joins an elite group of providers focused on complex stroke care. Of the 5,000 hospitals in the United States, Rhode Island Hospital is one of 82 health care organiza - tions to earn this designation. CSCs are required to have dedi- cated neuro-intensive care unit beds for complex stroke patients; advanced imaging capabilities; coordinated post-hospital care; and a peer-review process to evaluate and monitor care; and must participate in stroke research. They must also meet strict requirements for providing care to patients with a diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage; perform endovascular coiling or surgical clipping procedures for aneurysms; perform emergency retrieval of clots lodged in brain arteries; and administer IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)\u2014often called a \"blood clot buster.\" The Stroke Center at Rhode Island Hospital also received the Get With The Guidelines-Stroke Gold-Plus Quality Achieve - ment and the Target: Stroke Honor Roll awards from the Ameri- can Heart Association/American Stroke Association. The quality achievement award recognizes the hospital's commitment and success in implementing a higher standard of care by ensuring that stroke patients receive treatment according to nationally accepted guidelines. And the honor roll recognizes hospitals achieving 50 percent or higher door-to-needle times within 60 minutes in applicable stroke patients for one calendar quarter. Rhode Island Hospital is the only hospital in the state that has achieved both these distinctions and the CSC certification. For the sixth time, The Miriam Hospital was designated by The Joint Commission as a Primary Stroke Center. The advanced certification recognizes The Miriam Hospital Stroke Center, which cares for over 650 patients a year, as providing the highest quality stroke care. And for the fifth time, The Miriam Hospital achieved the Magnet recognition for excellence in nursing\u2014the highest honor an organization can receive for professional nurs- ing practice. The Pulmonary Hypertension Center at Rhode Island Hospital became one of the nation's first centers of its kind to be accredited by the Pulmonary Hypertension Association (PHA), and is the only PHA-accredited pulmonary hypertension center in New England. Accreditation assures patients with pulmonary hypertension and their providers that they have access to the most advanced care available in the country. Newport Hospital's Vanderbilt Rehabilitation Center received re-accreditation from the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF), the most important accredit- ing body in the rehabilitation field. The accreditation was the result of a two-day on-site visit during which the CARF team evaluated all aspects of the Vanderbilt Rehabilitation Center, including leadership and care provided.The Comprehensive Cancer Center of Rhode Island Hospi- tal, The Miriam Hospital and Newport Hospital is the only Rhode Island health system on Becker's Hospital Review's 2015 list of \"100 Hospitals and Health Systems with Great Oncology Programs.\" Hospitals and cancer centers on the list stand out in terms of quality patient care, clinical outcomes, and research achievements. The center also received a three-year accreditation with commendation from the Commission on Cancer (CoC), a program administered by the American College of Surgeons. To earn this designation, the center had to meet or exceed 34 quality care standards, agree to be evaluated every three years, and maintain levels of excellence in the delivery of comprehensive patient-centered care. The Comprehensive Cancer Center at Rhode Island Hospi- tal received the Midyear 2015 Outstanding Achievement Award from the CoC. Rhode Island Hospital is one of only 23 health care facilities in the nation\u2014and the only in Rhode Island\u2014to receive this national honor for excellence in providing quality care to cancer patients. The 35th Telly Awards for excellence in video and television named the Center for Prisoner Health and Human Rights at The Miriam Hospital a 2014 Online Video Bronze Telly Award winner for the piece, \"Staying Alive on the Outside.\" Funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the 19-minute instructional video on how to prevent, identify, and respond to opioid overdose was part of an intervention for individuals within 30 days of release from incarceration who reported using drugs and/or hav - ing family or friends who are active drug users. The individuals were provided naloxone at release. Drug overdose is the primary cause of death in people released from incarceration, and the risk is highest in the first few weeks after release. The research team worked with a docu - mentary filmmaker, former inmates, and family and friends of overdose victims. The video is currently being used to accompany an intervention in several prisons and jails, and is publicly avail- able online at prisonerhealth.org and other websites focused on promoting harm reduction. The video teaches viewers how to protect themselves and others by recognizing the signs of over- dose and learning how to administer naloxone to reverse it. The Women's Medicine Collaborative primary care team was designated a Level 3 Patient-Centered Medical Home by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA). Level 3 is NCQA's highest designation, recognizing medical homes that include after-hours and online access; shared decision-making and team-based care; patient engagement on health and health care; and lower costs related to reduced emergency department and hospital use. For the third time, Bradley Hospital earned the distinction of Top Performer on Key Quality Measures from The Joint Com - mission, the leading accreditor of health organizations in the United States. One of only four facilities in New England to receive distinction for psychiatric services, Bradley Hospital was recognized for attaining and sustaining excellence in accounta - bility measure performance for inpatient psychiatric services. Becker's Hospital Review 001Hospital and Health Systems withgreatoncologyprograms 28 27 Bruce M. Selya Award for Excellence in Research Annual Milton Hamolsky Outstanding Physician Award Charles C.J. Carpenter, MD Outstanding Physician of the Year 30 29 Bradley Hospital's director of child and family psychiatry, Gregory Fritz, MD, was named president of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Citing a shortage of psychiatrists along with the negative stigma associated with mental illnesses as barriers to accessing appropriate care, Dr. Fritz plans to focus on integrated care as his presiden - tial initiative. Newport Hospital again attained the distinguished Magnet designation by the American Nurses Credentialing Center, based on the hospital's continued adherence to rigorous national stan - dards of nursing practice. And Neil Ead, RN, MSN, CPNP, a pediatric advanced practice surgical nurse at Hasbro Children's Hospital, received the 2015 Founders Award from the American Pediatric Surgical Nurses Association. The award is presented annually for a significant contribution to the advancement of the care of pediatric surgical patients. In addition to the many recognitions Lifespan received from external organizations, Lifespan also presents its own pres- tigious awards to honor its most outstanding physicians. This past year, Lifespan honored Rami Kantor, MD, an infectious diseases expert, with the Bruce M. Selya Award for Excellence in Research. The award is presented annually for outstanding biomedical research among Lifespan partner hospitals. Dr. Kantor is an internal medicine and infectious diseases physician at Rhode Island and The Miriam hospitals, as well as an associate professor of medicine at The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University. Major themes of Dr. Kantor's research include HIV diversity, treatment monitoring, and the evolution of drug resistance. The medical staff of Rhode Island Hospital awarded Thomas M. Drew, MD, a cardiologist with the Cardiovascular Institute, the Annual Milton Hamolsky Outstanding Physician Award. Dr. Drew was honored for his dedication to ethical prac - tice, outstanding clinical skills and commitment to medical edu - cation. The award is the highest honor the medical staff bestows on one of its own. The Miriam Hospital awarded the Charles C.J. Carpenter, MD, Outstanding Physician of the Year Award for 2015 to Jeffrey Burock, MD, division director of psychiatry. The annual recogni- tion distinguishes a physician, nominated by his or her peers, for outstanding contributions to the field of medicine. Dr. Burock is a geriatric psychiatrist specializing in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, delirium and post-stroke complications to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and addictive disorders.Delta Dental of Rhode Island awarded a $350,000 grant to the Samuels Sinclair Dental Center at Rhode Island Hospital for new equipment and renovations that will help the center accommo - date up to 4,000 more patient visits annually. The grant is intended to improve access to affordable dental care for those with limited resources for dental care, especially children who otherwise may not receive needed care. A collaboration between Bradley Hospital and Hasbro Children's Hospital, the Medical Psychiatric Program completed expansions of both its inpatient unit and its partial hospitaliza - tion program to accommodate an increased demand for integrated medical and psychiatric care for children and adolescents. Recent years have seen a growing need, both locally and nation - ally, for this type of care, with the program at Hasbro Children's Hospital receiving patients from medical centers throughout the nation. Staffed by a multidisciplinary team of pediatricians, child psychiatrists, psychologists, advanced practice psychiatric nurses, social workers, pediatric nurses, mental health workers and nutritionists, the newly renovated inpatient unit provides optimal treatment for children and adolescents with both psy - chiatric and medical illnesses, and provides staff and families a greater opportunity to collaborate. In addition, the Hasbro Chil- dren's Partial Hospital Program, the only day treatment program in New England for children with combined medical and psy - chiatric illness, also expanded capacity from 16 patients to 24.The Bradley Hospital Foundation Board of Trustees raised more than $1.3 million to help create additional space for Bradley Hospital's outpatient services and the Pediatric Anxiety Research Center (PARC). The Ruggles Building was expanded and transformed into a colorful, open and inviting space that features larger group rooms; two occupational therapy rooms specifically for children with sensory integration difficulties, a therapeutic kitchen for children with speech and feeding prob - lems, an improved waiting area, outpatient therapy rooms, and space to accommodate PARC. Thanks to the philanthropy of many generous individuals, the children and families helped by Bradley Hospital's outpatient services now have a safe and comfortable space for treatment and healing. Newport Hospital completed a renovation of its Noreen Stonor Drexel Birthing Center, just in time for the center's twen - tieth anniversary. New artwork has also been added, and there is a dedicated area for special pieces that have been donated to the birthing center over the years. Newport Hospital also renovated office space to accommodate new providers and service lines, including spaces in the Borden Carey Building for the Lifespan Lyme Disease Center, and renovation of spaces in the Alletta Morris and Turner buildings and at 23 Powel Avenue for physia - try, pulmonary medicine and general surgery. Infrastructure As Lifespan's aliate hospitals and satellite locations continue to oer more services and serve more patients, physical space must be developed and improved. Our goal is to anticipate and address the evolving needs of our community in ways that oer patients greater convenience and allow comprehensive and seamless delivery of care. The Rhode Island Hospital department of neurology opened in a new location on the fifth floor of the Ambulatory Patient Center, centralizing the department's programs and services in one modern space. The new location improves access for patients and their families, and facilitates greater collaboration among clinicians. 32 31 At Lifespan we are committed to sharing our expertise beyond our hospitals and centers, into our wide and diverse community. We serve between 25,000 and 30,000 southern New Englanders annually through our community programs, which are often oered free or at a reduced cost. We believe that, as a health care system, we must work to safeguard health and prevent disease as well as provide medical care. Our hospitals' community-based clinics provide care for those suering from or at risk for disease, while helping people stay healthy by providing free screening and referral services. And recognizing that health is directly related to education and income levels, Lifespan's broader mis - sion includes educational programs and workforce development. Lifespan in the Community The Lifespan Community Health Institute (LCHI) complements and extends the services Lifespan offers the community by pro - moting primary prevention, offering programs that foster healthy communities, and partnering with community organizations and groups to address the full spectrum of condi- tions that affect health. Over the past year, the name change\u2014 from Lifespan Community Health Services to Lifespan Community Health Institute\u2014reflects a new focus on the root causes of poor health and lifestyle diseases. During fiscal year 2015, LCHI offered programs that bene - fitted over 14,000 people. LCHI organized more than 20 confer- ences and workshops with a total attendance of more than 1,600 adults. Events included Avenues of Healing (annual breast cancer educational conference), Conferencia Temas Familiares (annual parenting conference with all sessions delivered in Spanish), four Speaking of Kids evening workshops, and seven Community Health Ambassador lunch-time presentations. As an American Heart Association Community Training Center, LCHI held over 1,400 classes to train a total of 9,183 people how to perform car- dio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use an automated exter- nal defibrillator (AED). For children ages 11 to 14, LCHI offered 26 SafeSitter classes to teach older children how to safely care for themselves and others. Instruction covered CPR and first aid, as well as how to prevent choking and manage emergencies.LCHI offered health screenings and adult immunization clinics. In 2015 the Centers for Disease Control recognized Rhode Island for having the highest influenza vaccination rates in adults age 18 and older. LCHI held 29 free flu clinics for unin - sured and low income adults, resulting in 702 people vaccinated, 90 percent of whom were from Providence, Pawtucket, Central Falls and Woonsocket\u2014core cities with the highest rates of child poverty in Rhode Island. LCHI also offered six clinics for MMR (measles, mumps and rubella), varicella (chicken pox), tDap (tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis), and Twinrix (Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B) vaccinations, as well as nine blood pressure and cholesterol screenings for 214 adults, with appropriate referrals for those requiring medical care. LCHI also offered cancer screening programs. The See, Test & Treat program provided free breast and cervical cancer screen - ing to 45 uninsured women, who received same-day results and free follow-up treatments, as needed. The Sun Smarts program provided free melanoma screening to 433 adults and children at five Rhode Island beaches, resulting in 73 referrals and treatment for previously unidentified cases of melanoma. In addition to funding the activities of LCHI, Lifespan has been a leader in the effort to revitalize south Providence, one of our state's most economically depressed communities\u2014commit- ting $5 million over ten years as the anchor tenant in the Prairie 33 34 35 Avenue Revitalization Initiative. Lifespan also continued to revi- talize buildings in the Allens Avenue neighborhood for its expanding workforce, benefitting the city with new jobs, safer streets, and more buildings on the tax rolls. Lifespan continues to support The Institute for the Study and Practice of Nonviolence, which sponsors men and women to go into Providence neighborhoods that are blighted by violence and build relationships, help resolve conflicts before they become violent, and work with families affected by violence. Lifespan invests in education, both to promote greater awareness about health and wellness, and to open doors to careers in health care. Lifespan's Stepping Up program sup - ported more than 175 entry-level Lifespan employees to return to school to pursue careers in nursing and other health care pro - fessions, and the summer youth employmentprogram provided area teens the opportunity to experience a variety of health care careers through the paid, eight-week program. Lifespan also continued to support Year Up, a program dedicated to training disadvantaged youth in areas such as information services so that they qualify for high paying jobs at the end of a six-month internship. Over the past several years, Lifes- pan has committed more than $600,000 to this program, trained more than 30 young adults and hired more than 20 graduates of the program into full-time jobs. This past year, Lifespan took a different approach to interacting with the public about health concerns. Lifespan and the Rhode Island chapter of the Alzheimer's Association collaborated with the local art world to present a curated, multimedia art exhibit highlighting life with Alzheimer's disease. The exhibition, entitled \"Interstice: Memory, Mind and Alzheimer's Disease,\" opened on July 16, 2015 at the Cohen Gallery in the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, and ran through September 9. The exhibit led people through the process of understand - ing the fear and uncertainty a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can cause those afflicted and their families and to raise public awareness of the disease. The first-of-its-kind exhibit, featuring all Rhode Island-based artists, used mixed media to guide viewers through an emotional process that is marked by isola - tion and uncertainty, but also by altruistic acts, hope, progress and love. Sponsors included Lifespan; Creative Arts Council, Brown University; Norman Prince Neurosciences Institute, Rhode Island Hospital; Brown Institute for Brain Sciences; The Depart- ment of Cognitive, Linguistic & Psychological Sciences of Brown University; The University Neurology Foundation and the Alzheimer's Association. Lifespan affiliates have a long history of service to the community, extending the scope of the care and resources they provide through programs, conferences, presentations, and sup - port groups. For many years, Rhode Island Hospital has offered free clinics to the uninsured and underinsured, and Hasbro Children's Hospital's free programs include car-seat safety checks and Dream Night at the Zoo. Several new programs were made possible through highly effective partnerships with other health care organizations. This past year Rhode Island Hospital partnered with Boston Medical Center (BMC) and CVS Health and other local community pharmacies for a demonstration project of pharmacy-based naloxone rescue kits to help reduce opioid addiction and over- dose death in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. BMC received a $1.3 million grant from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality for the study. Drug overdose is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. The study recognized the potential of pharmacies to expand the reach and impact of critical public health interventions. Pharmacists are being educated about opioid addiction,overdose risk and the benefits of appropriate use of naloxone. Researchers from BMC, The Miriam Hospital, and the University of Rhode Island College of Phar- macy developed protocols for pharmacies to supply, order and provide naloxone to patients. The study will track and analyze data from the participating pharmacies throughout the two states to develop best practices for a national pharmacy-based naloxone rescue kit program. The Bradley Hasbro Children's Research Center (BHCRC) partnered with Adoption Rhode Island to develop a mental health clinic serving adolescents in the child welfare system. Funded through a $64,665 pilot grant from the Rhode Island Foundation, the COMPASS Clinic offers integrated clinical care that addresses the behavioral health needs of youth in foster care in Rhode Island. In this yearlong pilot project, adolescents in foster care experiencing mental health issues such as depression or anxiety will be paired with a mental health clinician from either Bradley Hospital or Adoptio n Rhode Island. Clinicians are cross-trained in best-practice inter- ventions for delivering adoption-competent and trauma-informed mental health treatment. The project aims to develop a model that can be sustained as an ongoing treatment clinic for youth in the child welfare system. Bradley Hospital renewed a contract with Boston Children's Hospital to continue providing inpatient psychiatric care to chil- dren served by Boston Children's. Now entering its second year, the partnership allows Bradley Hospital to help more children and teens in the greater Boston area who need mental health care, as well as to increase capacity to help children locally. Through its Capital City Food Pantry, Gateway Healthcare distributed more than 98,000 pounds of food to an average of 303 children and adults each month, amounting to almost 70,000 meals over the course of the year. Located at the TavaresCommunity Center in Providence, the pantry provides canned and frozen food products, meat, fish, and fresh produce to low- to-moderate income people in surrounding neighborhoods. The operation of the Food Pantry is made possible through generous donations from United Natural Foods, Inc.; The Rhode Island Foundation; Hasbro, Inc.; and many generous individual contributors. Lifespan's efforts to inform the public about health issues and healthy lifestyle prac - tices included a number of educational events. Bradley Hospital and the Lifespan Community Health Institute presented the 25th annual Parenting Matters conference. Over the past quarter of a century, more than 16,000 professionals and community members have attended the annual confer- ence that offers parents, childcare providers, social workers and teachers a unique oppor- tunity to learn from top child development and behavior professionals. Gateway Healthcare pro - vided or arranged for the provision of Mental Health First Aid training to almost 500 individuals in Rhode Island. The Total Joint Center at The Miriam Hospital offered a free interactive session for the public to learn about hip, knee, and shoulder pain and ways to relieve it. The two-hour event featured a hip and knee specialist, a shoulder specialist, and two members of The Miriam Hospital rehabilitation team. And The Minimally Invasive Urology Institute (MIUI) at The Miriam Hospital offered a bladder cancer awareness program in recogni- tion of Bladder Cancer Awareness Month. Experts from the MIUI answered questions about bladder cancer during the free,interactive session, which featured presentations on bladder and kidney health and nutrition tips for good urological health. Rhode Island has the highest per-capita rate of bladder cancer in the United States. Newport Hospital launched a free, monthly community lecture series, featuring clinicians speaking on health topics, including exercise and cardiac health; tips on managing medications; Lyme disease pre - vention and treatment; the controversy over childhood vaccinations, and more. Lectures are accompanied by free blood pressure screening and refreshments. Through its Frederick Henry Prince Memorial Fund, Newport Hospital awarded $75,330 to several local grant recipients to help fund innovative programs that increased the physical activity and health of Newport County children and families. Programs for 2015 ranged from biking, ballet, soccer, rugby, and trail-guiding to courses that teach pet care and how to design, build and row a boat. 36 Since 2013 Lifespan has focused much of its information tech - nology attention and resources on evaluating, selecting, learn - ing, validating, customizing, training and implementing a state-of-the-art electronic health system. This extraordinary eort came to fruition in fiscal year 2015 with the launch of our Epic-based Lifespan EHR, LifeChart. Information Technology 38 On March 29, 2015 at 2:18 a.m., Lifespan - which had set up fully staffed command centers at each hospital and in the infor- mation technology building in Providence - officially converted hundreds of thousands of medical records to the single Epic sys- tem, a process known in the industry as \"going live.\" Leadership, clinicians, and IT experts were among the hundreds of Lifespan staff in the command centers to ensure that the conversion went smoothly and to manage issues and questions as they arose. All clinical inpatient and outpatient departments at all Lifespan hospitals and physician practices, as well as departments involved in the revenue cycle and patient records, participated in the conversion to LifeChart. Far more than seeing a new screen or flipping a switch, the LifeChart go-live in March was a mile - stone in the larger process of clinical, administrative, and research transformation inherent in a system of this scale. In the ensuing months LifeChart experts in Lifespan IS and in clinical and administrative operating departments continue to support employees and medical staff as they gain skill and confidence in their use of LifeChart.Having now moved from the post-live stabilization phase to the optimization phase of our LifeChart journey, we shift focus to new features and improvements in LifeChart that will bring measurable benefits to users and the organization as a whole. This phase is an ongoing process of refining the system through both configuration changes made by Lifespan IS and application upgrades developed by Epic and implemented every 18 to 24 months. In these upgrades, Epic will provide thou sands of enhancements to our LifeChart system, including severalnew modules, a streamlined user interface for easier and more effi- cient use, and more. Users will be able to more quickly find the information they need, zero in on the most recent patient information, and know who made the most recent changes through a new identifier function. A key element of our LifeChart optimization is the gover- nance by clinical and operational leaders to prioritize the areas on which to focus our available time and resources. As we proceed on our LifeChart optimization journey, our clinicians will see benefits in use, patient safety, and efficiency. 37 Lifespan is a comprehensive, patient-centered health care delivery system and an academic medical center that supports groundbreaking centers such as the Norman Prince Neuro - sciences Institute, the Orthopedics Institute, and the Cardiovas - cular Institute, among others. This sophisticated enterprise requires the expertise of leaders in their fields. Lifespan recruits leadership from among the best and this year was pleased to bring more outstanding clinicians and professionals into leadership roles. Promotions and Recruitment First, we wish to acknowledge one of our most accomplished and inspirational physicians. More than 25 years after joining Rhode Island Hospital, Michael Ehrlich, MD , orthopedic surgeon and chairman of the department of orthopedics, recently stepped down as department chairman. We are deeply grateful to Dr. Ehrlich, who built an exceptional clinical program, developed a renowned academic program, and leaves a legacy of groundbreaking research.
