The national preparedness architecture encomp asses the full spectrum of prevention, protection, response, and recovery efforts to prepare the Nati on for all hazards - whether terrorist attack or natural disaster. Homeland Security Presidential Dire ctive-8 (HSPD-8) of December 17, 2003 ( \"National Preparedness\" ) directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop a national domestic all- hazards preparedness goal. As part of that e ffort, in March 2005 the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released the Interim National Preparedness Goal. Publication of the National Preparedness Guidelines (Guidelines ) finalizes development of the national goal and its related preparedness tools. The Guidelines , including the supporting Target Capabilities List, simultaneously published online, supersedes the Interim National Preparedness Goal and defines what it means for the Nation to be prepared for all hazards. There are four critic al elements of the Guidelines : (1) The National Preparedness Vision, which provides a concise statement of the core preparedness goal for the Nation. (2) The National Planning Scenarios, which depict a diverse set of high-consequence threat scenarios of both potential te rrorist attacks and natural di sasters. Collectively, the 15 scenarios are designed to focus contingency planning for homeland security preparedness work at all levels of government and with the private sector. The scenarios form the basis for coordinated Federal planning, traini ng, exercises, and grant investments needed to prepare for emergencies of all types. (3) The Universal Task List (UTL), which is a menu of some 1,600 unique tasks that can facilitate efforts to prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from the major events that are represented by the National Pla nning Scenarios. It presents a common vocabulary and identifies key tasks that s upport development of e ssential capabilities among organizations at all levels. Of c ourse, no entity will perform every task. (4) The Target Capabilities List (TCL), which defines 37 specific capabilities that communities, the private sector , and all levels of government should collectively possess in order to respond effectively to disasters. The Guidelines reinforce the fact th at preparedness is a shared responsibility. They were developed through an extensive process that invo lved more than 1,500 Federal, State, and local officials and more than 120 national associations . They also integrate lessons learned following Hurricane Katrina and a 2006 review of States' and major cities' emergency operations and evacuation plans. iii Protecting America requires constant vigilance and innovation. These Guidelines will shape and support preparedness activities in the months and years ahead, wh ile growing and evolving with the Nation as it strengthens prepar edness at all levels of government and within the private sector. -- Michael Chertoff Secretary of Homeland Security September 2007 iv TABLE OF CONTENTS PREFACE...................................................................................................... iii 1.0 INTRODUCTION.................................................................................... 1 2.0 VISION................................................................................................. 1 2.1 The Guidelines Are the Umbrella for a Range of Readiness Initiatives........................ 2 2.2 The Guidelines Are All-Hazards....................................... ............................. 3 2.3 The Guidelines Are Risk-Based..................................................................... 3 2.4 The Guidelines Are a Call to Action................................................................ 3 3.0 CAPABILITIES....................................................................................... 4 4.0 PRIORITIES.......................................................................................... 11 4.1 Expand Regional Collaboration.................................................................... 12 4.2 Implement the National Incident Mana gement System and National Response Plan...... 13 4.3 Implement the National In frastructure Protection Plan......................................... 14 4.4 Strengthen Information Shar ing and Collaboration Capabilities.............................. 15 4.5 Strengthen Interoperable and Operable Communications Capabilities....................... 17 4.6 Strengthen CBRNE Detection, Response, and Decontamination Capabilities.............. 18 4.7 Strengthen Medical Surge a nd Mass Prophylaxis Capabilities................................ 19 4.8 Community Preparedness: Strengthening Planning and Citizen Capabilities............... 20 5.0 A NATIONAL PREPAREDNESS SY STEM SUPPORTS THE GUIDELINES........... 22 6.0 MANAGEMENT AND MAINTENANCE...................................................... 23 APPENDIX A\u2014 Letter of Instruction.................................................................... 26 APPENDIX B\u2014 Capabilities-Based Preparedness 31 APPENDIX C\u2014 Terms and Definitions.................................................................. 41 APPENDIX D\u2014 Acronyms and Abbreviations.......................................................... 46 LIST OF FIGURES Figure 1: The Guidelines in Context........................................................................ 2 Figure 2: Capabilities......................................................................................... 4 Figure 3: Elements of Capability............................................................................ 5 Figure 4: Capabilities and Outcomes....................................................................... 6 Figure 5: National Priorities and Associated Capabilities..............................................11 Figure 6: National Preparedness System................................................................. 22 Figure B-1: National Planning Scenarios..................................................................32 Figure B-2: Capabilities-Ba sed Preparedness Process...................................................34 v Questions, comments, and suggested improvements related to this document are encouraged.

For more information on HSPD-8 implementation, go to http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/odp/assessments/hspd8.htm vi 1.0 INTRODUCTION On December 17, 2003, the President issued HSPD- 8. HSPD-8 established national policies to strengthen the preparedness of the United States to prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from threatened or actual terrorist attack s, major disasters, and other emergencies within the United States. HSPD-8 directed the Secret ary of Homeland Security to develop a national domestic all-hazards preparedness goal in coor dination with the heads of other appropriate Federal departments and agencies and in consulta tion with State, local, tribal, and territorial governments. The National Preparedness Guidelines (Guidelines ) finalize development of the national preparedness goal and its related preparedness tools. The purposes of the Guidelines are to: \u0083 Organize and synchronize national (i ncluding Federal, State, local , tribal, and territorial) efforts to strengthen national preparedness; \u0083 Guide national investments in national preparedness; \u0083 Incorporate lessons learned from past disast ers into national preparedness priorities; \u0083 Facilitate a capability-based and risk-b ased investment planning process; and \u0083 Establish readiness metrics to measure progr ess and a system for assessing the Nation's overall preparedness capability to respond to major events , especially those involving acts of terrorism. The Guidelines include a vision, capabilities, an d priorities for national preparedness. In order to support a consistent nationwide a pproach to implementation, the Guidelines establish three capabilities-based preparedness tools and a Natio nal Preparedness System - all of which are discussed in the sections that follow. 2.0 VISION The vision for the National Preparedness Guidelines is: A NATION PREPARED with c oordinated capabilities to prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from all hazards in a way that balances risk with resources and need. This vision is far-reaching. It recognizes that preparedness requires a coordinated national effort involving every level of government, as we ll as the private sector, nongovernmental organizations, and individual citizens. It addr esses capabilities-based preparedness for the full range of homeland security missions, from prevention through recovery. States, communities, and the Federal Government have worked together for decades to manage natural disasters and technological emergencies, partic ularly with regard to response and recovery. However, they have far less experience with terrorist attacks, particularly with regard to prevention and protection. The Guidelines address all hazards and place h eavy emphasis on events at the catastrophic end of the risk con tinuum, especially terrorist att acks, which would require rapid 1 and coordinated national action. The vision acknowledges that th e Nation cannot achieve total preparedness for every possible contingency a nd that no two jurisdictions possess identical capability needs. We must weigh the relative risk of catastrophic events when determining the resources available to address each conti ngency and the unique needs of each community, determine how to best address needs in light of the risks, and thereby achieve optimal and reasonable levels of preparedness. 2.1 The Guidelines Are the Umbrella for a Rang e of Readiness Initiatives HSPD-8 is one of several presid ential directives that address how the Nation should prepare to prevent, protect against, respond to, and rec over from major incident s. Other presidential directives address the evolvi ng threats posed by terrorist at tacks and natural disasters. The Guidelines are umbrella documents that collate many plans, strategies, and systems into an overarching framework, the National Preparedness System. Plans and systems will be implemented and requirements will be matched with resources, consistent with applicable law and subject to the availa bility of appropriations. Figure 1: The Guidelines in Context 2 2.2 The Guidelines Are All-Hazards As directed by the President in HSPD-8, the Guidelines adopt an all-hazards approach to preparedness. An all-hazards approach addres ses capabilities-based preparedness to prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from terrorist attacks, major disasters, and other emergencies. 2.3 The Guidelines Are Risk-Based The Guidelines establish a risk-based approach to prep aredness. Risk is a function of three variables: threat, vulnerability, and consequence. Both threat a nd vulnerability are influenced by the probabilities of events that ar e highly uncertain. In order to compensate for that uncertainty, the Guidelines provide a set of National Pl anning Scenarios that represent a range of threats that warrant national attention. The National Planni ng Scenarios establish common assumptions to guide planning nationwide regarding potential vuln erabilities and conseque nces (or impacts) of major incidents. Analysis of the range of poten tial impacts is essential for defining capabilities in terms of both capacity (i.e., how many are needed) and proficiency (i.e., how well must they be able to perform). These capab ilities must be reflected in em ergency operations plans (for the near-term) and in preparedness strategies (for the long-term). Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial officials supplement th is approach with risk assessme nts that provide additional data on their specific threats, vulnerabi lities, and consequences. As a re sult, officials can tailor their approach according to differences in risk across the Nation. 2.4 The Guidelines Are a Call to Action Preparedness is the foundation of successful National Incident Management System (NIMS) implementation. The NIMS places responsibility on i ndividual Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial governments and agencies for establ ishing a preparedness cycle in advance of an incident and for including the private sector , non-governmental organizations, and individual citizens, as appropriate. The cycle of prepar edness for prevention, protection, response, and recovery missions may be summarized as follows: \u0083 Plan \u0083 Organize and Staff \u0083 Equip \u0083 Train \u0083 Exercise, Evaluate, and Improve Preparedness is the responsibility of every le vel of government, every department, and every agency consistent with its aut horities. This includes coordinating preparedness activities among partners operating within their jurisdictional borders, as well as across jurisdictional and geographic borders when dictated by identified threats and risk assessments. Preparedness 3 should be coordinated across the same multi-agency coordination entities as described in the NIMS. This is the basis for implementing the Guidelines , particularly the national priority to Expand Regional Collaborati on (see Section 4.1). Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial governments, in c ooperation with the private and non- profit sectors, each have a unique role in s upporting the preparedness framework established by the Guidelines . All levels of government should integr ate into their preparedness and response plans the capacity of communit y, faith-based, and other nongovern mental organizations. This integration includes engaging such organizations in the planning process, providing necessary training and credentialin g of their personnel, providing necessary resource support for involvement in a joint response, and incorporating the organizations in training and exercises. Of highest importance is the de velopment of mechanisms for coordination of the volunteers, goods, and services available through these organizations. The Guidelines provide a national framework for a capab ilities-based preparedness system and are designed to be measurable so that progress can be determined and specific improvements can be made. Specific metrics and standards are und er development for jurisdictions to use when conducting preparedness assessments. Additionall y, a process is being established to measure the Nation's overall preparedness. (Guidance on institutionalizing the Guidelines is provided within the Secretary's Letter of Instruction in Appendix A.) 3.0 CAPABILITIES The Guidelines establish a capabilities-based approach to preparedness. Simply put, a capability provides the means to accomplish a mission. The Guidelines address preparedness for all homeland security mission areas: prevention, prot ection, response, and recovery. Capabilities are presented alphabetically be low by mission area for ease of reference (see Figure 2). Some capabilities cut across all mission areas and are therefore placed in a Common Mission Area. Figure 2: Capabilities Common Mission Area Respond Mission Area Communications Animal Health Emergency Support Community Preparedness and Participation Citizen Evacuation and Shelter-in-Place Planning Critical Resource Logistics and Distribution Risk Management Emergency Operations Center Management Intelligence/Information Sharing and Dissemination Emergency Public Information and Warning Prevent Mission Area Environmental Health CBRNE Detection Explosive Device Response Operations Information Gathering and Recognition of Indicators and Warnings Fatality Management Intelligence Analysis and Production Fire Incident Response Support Counter-Terror Investigations and Law Enforcement Isolation and Quarantine 4 Protect Mission Area Respond Mission Area (continued) Critical Infrastructure Protection Mass Care (Sheltering, Feeding, and Related Services) Epidemiological Surveillance and Investigation Mass Prophylaxis Food and Agriculture Safety and Defense Medical Supplies Management and Distribution Laboratory Testing Medical Surge Onsite Incident Management Emergency Public Safety and Security Response Responder Safety and Health Emergency Triage and Pre-Hospital Treatment Search and Rescue (Land-Based) Volunteer Management and Donations WMD/Hazardous Materials Response and Decontamination Recover Mission Area Economic and Community Recovery Restoration of Lifelines Structural Damage Assessment Source: Target Capabilities List, as of September 2007 A capability consists of the combination of elem ents required to delive r the desired outcome. Capability elements are consistent with the NIMS (see Figure 3). Figure 3: Elements of Capability Planning Collection and analysis of intelligence and information, and development of policies, plans, procedures, mutual aid agreements, strategies, and other publications that comply with relevant laws, regulations, and guidance necessary to perform assigned missions and tasks. Organization and Leadership Individual teams, an overall organizational structure, and leadership at each level in the structure that comply with relevant laws, regulations, and guidance necessary to perform assigned missions and tasks. Personnel Paid and volunteer staff who meet re levant qualification and certification standards necessary to perform assigned missions and tasks. Equipment and Systems Major items of equipment, supplies, facilities, and systems that comply with relevant standards necessary to perform assigned missions and tasks. Training Content and methods of delivery that comp ly with relevant training standards necessary to perform assigned missions and tasks. Exercises, Evaluations, and Corrective Actions Exercises, self-assessments, peer-asses sments, outside reviews, compliance monitoring, and actual major events that provide opportunities to demonstrate, evaluate, and improve the combined capab ility and interoperability of the other elements to perform assigned missions and tasks to standards necessary to achieve successful outcomes. 5 Any combination of elements that delivers the desired outcome is acceptable (see Figure 4). Figure 4: Capabilities and Outcomes (Listed in Alphabetical Order) Common \u0083 Communications Outcome: A continuous flow of critical information is maintained as needed among multi-jurisdictional and multi-disciplinary emergency responders, command posts, agencies, and governmental officials for the duration of the emergency response operation in compliance with the NIMS. In order to accomplish that, the jurisdiction has a continuity of operations plan for public safety communications including the consideration of critical components, networks, support systems, personnel, and an appropriate level of redundant communications systems in the event of an emergency. \u0083 Community Preparedness and Participation Outcome: There is a structure and a process for ongoing collaboration between government and nongovernmental organizations at all levels; volunteers and nongover nmental resources are incorporated in plans and exercises; the public is ed ucated, trained, and aware; citizens participate in volunteer programs and provide surge capaci ty support; nongovernmental resources are managed effectively in disasters; and there is a process to evaluate progress. \u0083 Planning Outcome: Plans incorporate an accurate threat analysis and risk assessment and ensure that capabilities required to prevent, protect against, res pond to, and recover from all-hazards events are available when and where they are needed. Plans are vertically and horizontally integrated with appropriate departments, agencies, and jurisdicti ons. Where appropriate, emergency plans incorporate a mechanism for requesting State and Federal assistance and include a clearly delineated process for seeking and requesting assistance from appropriate agency(ies). \u0083 Risk Management Outcome: Federal, State, local, tribal, territorial, and pr ivate-sector entities id entify and assess risks, prioritize and select appropriate protection, prev ention, and mitigation solutions based on reduction of risk, monitor the outcomes of allocation decisions , and undertake corrective actions. Additionally, Risk Management is integrated as a planning construc t for effective prioritization and oversight of all homeland security investments. \u0083 Intelligence/Information Sharing and Dissemination Outcome: Effective and timely sharing of information and intelligence occurs across Federal, State, local, tribal, territorial, regional, and private sector entities to achieve coordinated awareness of, prevention of, protection against, and response to a threatened or actual domestic terrorist attack, major disaster, or other emergency. Prevent Mission Area \u0083 CBRNE Detection Outcome: Chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and/or explosive (CBRNE) materials are rapidly detected and characterized at borders and ports of entry, critical locations, events, and incidents. \u0083 Information Gathering and Recogni tion of Indicators and Warnings Outcome: Locally generated threat and other cr iminal and/or terrorism-related information is identified, gathered, entered into an appropriate data/retrieval system, and provided to appropriate analysis centers. 6 \u0083 Intelligence Analysis and Production Outcome: Timely, accurate, and actionable intelligence/info rmation products are produced in support of prevention, awareness, deterrence, resp onse, and continuity planning operations. \u0083 Counter-Terror Investigations and Law Enforcement Outcome: Suspects involved in criminal activiti es related to homeland se curity are successfully deterred, detected, disrupted, in vestigated, and apprehended. All coun terterrorism-related cases are aggressively prosecuted. Protect Mission Area \u0083 Critical Infrastructure Protection Outcome: The risk to, vulnerability of, and consequen ce of an attack on critical infrastructure are reduced through the identification of critical infrastructure; conduct, documentation, and standardization of risk assessments; prioritization of assets; decisions regarding protective and preventative programs; and implementation of protective and preventative plans. \u0083 Epidemiological Surveillance and Investigation Outcome: Potential exposure to disease is ident ified rapidly by determining exposure and mode of transmission and agent; interrupting transmission to contain the spread of the event; and reducing number of cases. Confirmed cases are reported im mediately to all relevant public health, food regulatory, environmental regulatory, and law enforcement agencies. Suspected cases are investigated promptly, reported to relevant public health authorities, and accurately confirmed to ensure appropriate preventive or curative counterm easures are implemented. An outbreak is defined and characterized; new suspect cases are identified and characterized based on case definitions on an ongoing basis; relevant clinical specimens are obtained and transported for confirmatory laboratory testing; the source of exposure is trac ked; methods of transmissi on identified; and effective mitigation measures are communicated to the publ ic, providers, and relevant agencies, as appropriate. \u0083 Food and Agriculture Safety and Defense Outcome: Threats to food and agricultural safety are prevented, mitigated, and eradicated; affected products are disposed of; affected facilities are decontaminated; public and plant health are protected; notification of the event and instructions of approp riate actions are effectively communicated with all stakeholders; trade in agricul tural products is restored safely; and confidence in the U.S. food supply is maintained. \u0083 Public Health Laboratory Testing Outcome: Chemical, radiological, and biological agents causing, or having the potential to cause, widespread illness or death are rapidly detected and accurately identified by the public health laboratory within the jurisdiction or through network collaboration with other appropriate Federal, State, and local laboratories. The public health labo ratory, working in close partnership with public health epidemiology, environmental health, law enforcement, agriculture and veterinary officials, hospitals, and other appropriate agencies, produc es timely and accurate data to support ongoing public health investigations and the implementat ion of appropriate prev entative or curative countermeasures. Respond Mission Area \u0083 Animal Disease Emergency Support Outcome: Foreign animal disease is prevented from ent ering the United States by protecting the related critical infrastructure and key assets. In the event of an incident, animal disease is detected 7 as early as possible, exposure of livestock to foreign diseases is reduced, immediate and humane actions to eradicate the outbreak are implemented, public and animal health and the environment are protected, continuity of agriculture and related business is safely maintained and/or restored, and economic damage is minimized. Trade in agricultural products and domestic and international confidence in the U.S. food supply ar e safely maintained or restored. \u0083 Citizen Evacuation and Shelter-In-Place Outcome: Affected and at-risk populations (and co mpanion animals to the extent necessary to save human lives) are safely sheltered-in-place or evacuated to safe refuge areas. \u0083 Critical Resource Logistics and Distribution Outcome: Critical resources are available to incident managers and emergency responders upon request for proper distribution and to aid disaster victims in a cost-effective and timely manner. \u0083 Emergency Operations Center Management Outcome: The event is effectively managed thro ugh multi-agency coordination for a pre-planned or no-notice event. \u0083 Emergency Public Information and Warning Outcome: Government agencies and public and private sector entities receive and transmit coordinated, prompt, useful, and reliable informat ion regarding threats to their health, safety, and property, through clear, consistent information-de livery systems. This information is updated regularly and outlines protective measures that can be taken by individuals and their communities. \u0083 Environmental Health Outcome: After the primary event, disease and injury are prevented through the quick identification of associated environmental hazards, including exposure to infectious diseases that are secondary to the primary event as well as secondary transmission modes. The at-risk population (i.e., exposed or potentially exposed) receives the appropriate counter measures, including treatment or protection, in a timely manner. The rebuilding of the public health infrastructure, removal of environmental hazards, and appropriate decontamination of the environment enable the safe re -entry and re-occupancy of the impacted area. Continued monitoring occurs thro ughout the recovery process in order to identify hazards and reduce exposure. \u0083 Explosive Device Response Operations Outcome: Threat assessments are cond ucted, the explosive and/or hazardous devices are rendered safe, and the area is cleared of hazards. Measures are implemented in the following priority order: ensure public safety; safeguard the officers on t he scene (including the bomb technician); collect and preserve evidence; protect and preserve public and private property; and restore public services. \u0083 Fatality Management Outcome: Complete documentation and recovery of hum an remains and items of evidence (except in cases where the health risks posed to personnel out weigh the benefits of recovery of remains). Remains receive surface decontamination (if indica ted) and, unless catastrophic circumstances dictate otherwise, are examined, identified, and released to the next-of-kin's funeral home with a complete certified death certificate. Reports of missing persons and ante mortem data are efficiently collected. Victims' family members receive updated information prior to the media release. All hazardous material regulations are reviewed and any restrictions on the transportation and disposition of remains are made clear by those with the authority and responsibility to establish the standards. Law enforcement agencies are given a ll information needed to investigate and prosecute the case successfully. Families are provided incident-specific support services. \u0083 Fire Incident Response Support Outcome: Dispatch and safe arrival of the initial fire s uppression resources occur within jurisdictional 8 response time objectives. The first unit to arri ve initiates the Incident Command System (ICS), assesses the incident scene, communicates t he situation, and requests appropriate resources including any necessary mutual ai d or cross-discipline support. Fi refighting activities are conducted safely and fire hazards are contained, controlled, extinguished, and investigated, and the incident is managed in accordance with emergency response plans and procedures. \u0083 Isolation and Quarantine Outcome: Individuals who are ill, exposed, or likely to be exposed are separated, movement is restricted, basic necessities of life are available, and their health is monitored in order to limit the spread of a newly introduced contagious disease (e.g ., pandemic influenza). Legal authority for those measures is clearly defined and communicated to a ll responding agencies and the public. Logistical support is provided to maintain measures until danger of contagion has elapsed. \u0083 Mass Care (Sheltering, Feeding, and Related Services) Outcome: Mass care services, including sheltering, feeding, and bulk distribution, are rapidly provided for the population and companion animals within the affected area. \u0083 Mass Prophylaxis Outcome: Appropriate drug prophylaxis and vaccination strategies are implemented in a timely manner upon the onset of an event to prevent the development of di sease in exposed individuals. Public information strategies include recommendat ions on specific actions individuals can take to protect their family, friends, and themselves. \u0083 Medical Supplies Management and Distribution Outcome: Critical medical supplies and equipment are appropriately secured, managed, distributed, and restocked in a timeframe appropriate to the incident. \u0083 Medical Surge Outcome: Injured or ill from the event are rapidly and approp riately cared for. Continuity of care is maintained for non-incident related illness or injury. \u0083 Onsite Incident Management Outcome: The event is managed safely, effectively, and efficiently through the common framework of the ICS. \u0083 Emergency Public Safety and Security Response Outcome: The incident scene is assessed and secured; access is controlled; security support is provided to other response operations (and related critical locations, facilities, and resources); emergency public information is provided while protecting first responders and mitigating any further public risks; and any crime/incident scene preservation issues are addressed. \u0083 Responder Safety and Health Outcome: No illnesses or injury to any first responder, fi rst receiver, medical facility staff member, or other skilled support personnel as a result of preventable exposure to secondary trauma, chemical/radiological release, infectious disease, or physical and emotional stress after the initial incident or during decontamination and incident follow-up. \u0083 Emergency Triage and Pre-Hospital Treatment Outcome: Emergency Medical Services (EMS) resources are effectively and appropriately dispatched and provide pre-hospital triage, treatment, transport, tracking of patients, and documentation of care appropriate for the incident, while maintaining the capabilities of the EMS system for continued operations. 9 \u0083 Search and Rescue (Land-Based) Outcome: The greatest numbers of victims (hum an and, to the extent that no humans remain endangered, animal) are rescued and transferred to medica l or mass care capabilities, in the shortest amount of time, while maintaining rescuer safety. \u0083 Volunteer Management and Donations Outcome: The positive effect of using u naffiliated volunteers and unsolicited donations is maximized and does not hinder response and recovery activities. \u0083 WMD/Hazardous Materials Response and Decontamination Outcome: Any hazardous materials release is ra pidly identified and mitigated; victims exposed to the hazard are rescued, decontaminated, and treat ed; the impact of the release is limited; and responders and at-risk populat ions are effectively protected. Recover Mission Area \u0083 Economic and Community Recovery Outcome: Economic impact is estimated; priorities are set for recovery activities; business disruption is minimized; and individuals and families are provided wi th appropriate levels and types of relief with minimal delay. \u0083 Restoration of Lifelines Outcome: Lifelines to undertake sustainable emergency response and recovery activities are established. \u0083 Structural Damage Assessment Outcome: Accurate situation needs and damage assessments occur. The full range of engineering, building inspection, and enforcement services ar e implemented, managed, and coordinated in a way that maximizes the use of resources, aids emergency response, and implements recovery operations. Mitigation projects to lessen the impact of sim ilar future events are identified and prioritized. Source: Target Capabilities List, as of September 2007 The challenge for government officials, work ing with the private sector, nongovernmental organizations, and individual citizens, is to determine the best way to build capabilities for bolstering preparedness and achieving the Guidelines . The \"best way\" will vary across the Nation. In order to assist o fficials in that effort, the Guidelines establish a Capabilities-Based Preparedness process and three planning tools: the National Planning Scenarios ; the Target Capabilities List (TCL); and the Universal Task List (UTL), which are discussed in detail in Appendix B. The National Planning Scenarios are designed to identify the broad spectrum of tasks and capabilities needed for all-hazards pr eparedness. The TCL is a comprehensive catalog of capabilities to perform homeland security missions, including performance measures and metrics for common tasks. The UTL is a librar y and hierarchy of task s by homeland security mission area. Capabilities-Based Preparedness encourages flexibi lity and requires collaboration. More importantly, it helps to ensure that opera tions planners and program managers across the Nation can use common tools and processes wh en making planning, trai ning, equipment, and other investments, and can produce measurable results. For more information on how the Guidelines contribute to the developmen t of specific homeland security capabilities, please refer to Appendix B. 10 4.0 PRIORITIES HSPD-8 directs that the Guidelines establish measurable readine ss priorities and targets. The Guidelines include a series of nationa l priorities to guide prepare dness efforts that meet the Nation's most urgent needs (see Figure 5). Th e priorities reflect major themes and recurring issues identified in national strategies, presidential directives, State and Urban Area Homeland Security Strategies, the Hurricane Katrina Repor ts, and other lessons-learned reports. The priorities will be updated or refined over time as we implement the Guidelines or encounter changes in the homeland security strategic environment.

They are also required to provide information on specific, concrete actions that will demonstrate progress in achieving these priori ties in their annual program guid ance. A brief discussion of the national priorities follows, incl uding examples of major Federa l programs that support each priority. 11 4.1 Expand Regional Collaboration National Priority: Standardized structures and processe s for regional collaboration enable entities collectively to manage and coordina te activities for opera tions and preparedness consistently and effectively. Discussion: Regional collaboration is critical to improving preparedness and achieving the tenets set forth in the Guidelines. As used in this document, a \"region\" generally refers to a geographic area consisting of contiguous Federal, State, local, tr ibal, and territorial jurisdictions. Major events often have regi onal impact; therefore, preven tion, protection, response, and recovery missions require extensive regional coll aboration. It is vital to enhance efforts by Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial entities to communicate and coordinate with one another, the private sector, nongovern mental organizations, and individu al citizens. The intent is to identify geographic regions that work be st for achieving and su staining coordinated capabilities and mutual aid agreements. Federa l departments and agenci es should foster those regional groupings through planni ng and Federal preparedness assi stance. Formal arrangements among geographic regions will enable the Federal Government, working with States, territories, local, and tribal governments and other partners, to coordinate prepare dness activities more effectively, spread costs, pool resources, disburse risk, and thereby increase the overall return on investment. One example of an initiative that supports this priority is the Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI) managed by DHS. This initiative focuses on a limited number of high-threat urban areas. The UASI also includes multi-jurisdictional metropo litan regions identified by States that do not have a designated urban area. Another example is the Cities Readiness Initiative (CRI), led by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in collaboration with the Un ited States Postal Service. This initiative focuses on selected cities to help them prepar e to provide life-saving interventions through the timely delivery of medicines and medical supplies during a large-scale pub lic health emergency. The Emergency Management Assistance Compac t (EMAC), a State-to -State partnership coordinated by the National Emergency Management Association (NEMA), also supports this priority. The EMAC was congressi onally ratified in 1996 to provide a fast and flexible response system through which States send requested personnel and equipment to help disaster relief efforts in other States. All 50 St ates, the District of Columbia, Pu erto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have enacted legislation to become members of the EMAC. During Hurricane Katrina, EMAC provided interstate mutual aid in th e response effort by deploying more than 67,000 personnel to Louisiana and Mississippi. Additional information on Homeland Security Grant Programs such as UASI can be found online at: http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/odp/grants_programs.htm Additional information on the Cities Readiness Initiative can be found online at: http://www.bt.cdc.gov/cri/ Additional information on the EMAC can be found online at: http://www.emacweb.org 12 4.2 Implement the National Incident Manageme nt System and National Response Plan National Priority: The National Incident Management Sy stem (NIMS) and National Response Plan (NRP) are fully implemented nationwide and support the coordinated development of capabilities. Discussion: Homeland Security Presidential Directive -5 (HSPD-5) (\" Management of Domestic Incidents \") of February 28, 2003, mandate d the development of the NIMS and the NRP. The NIMS, released in March 2004, provides a consiste nt framework for government entities at all levels to work together to manage domestic inci dents, regardless of cause , size, or complexity. The NIMS includes a core set of guidelines, standards, and protocols for command and management, preparedness, resource mana gement, communications and information management, supporting technologies, and c oordination and maintenance to promote interoperability and compatibility among Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial capabilities. The NRP, using the template established by th e NIMS, was released in December 2004. The NRP is an all-discipline, all-hazards plan that establishes a single, comprehensive framework for the management of domestic incidents. It provides the structure and mechanisms for evolving or potential incidents requiring a c oordinated Federal response. Th e NRP is always in effect. However, the NRP coordinating st ructures and processes are flexible and scalable and can be activated at different levels depe nding on the nature of the threat or incident. Actions range in scope from ongoing situational re porting and analysis, throug h the implementation of NRP Incident Annexes and other supplemental Federal contingency plans, to full implementation of all relevant NRP coordination mechanisms. In May 2006, DHS published a Notice of Change to the NRP in order to address a limited number of issues requiring amendm ents prior to the official review of the NRP. The alterations, or in some cases, clarifications, were based on lessons learned from exercises and real-world events. The modifications in the Notice of Ch ange strengthened national doctrine and operating concepts for incidents requiring a coordinated Federal response. All Federal departments and agencies, and other NRP signatori es, are required to implement and operate under the concepts of the NRP. Since then, DHS has worked clos ely with stakeholders to revi se the National Response Plan (NRP). Because the issues are complex and require national-level policy decisions, DHS is working on an updated document that addresses the roles and responsibilitie s of stakeholders and incident management structures. DHS will release the new draft of the NRP once stakeholders have been able to review and comment on the doc ument. In the meantime, the structures and mechanisms of the original NRP, with modifications from the May 2006 Notice of Change, are still intact and should be used for any hazard or threat occurring prior to the approval and release of the revised NRP.

Discussion: The Homeland Security Act of 2002 directs DHS to ensure the protection of the Nation's critical infrastructure and key resources (CI/KR). Homeland Security Presidential Directive-7 (HSPD-7) (\" Critical Infrastructure Identification, Prioritization, and Protection \") of December 17, 2003, directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish a national plan, working closely with other Federal departments and agencies, State, local, tribal, and territorial governments, and the private sector, to unify th e Nation's efforts to protect CI/KR. The NIPP is the comprehensive risk management framework that clearly defines critical infrastructure protection roles and responsibilities for a ll levels of government, private industry, nongovernmental agencies, and tribal partners. The NIPP lays out the plan for setting requirements for infrastructure protection, which will help ensure our government, economy, and public services continue in the event of a terrorist attack or other disaster . The NIPP was released on June 30, 2006. The purpose of the NIPP is to \"build a safer, more secure, and more resilient America by enhancing protection of the Nation's CI/KR to prevent, deter, neutralize, or mitigate the effects of deliberate efforts by terrorists to destroy, incapacitate, or exploit them; and to strengthen national preparedness, ti mely response, and rapid recovery in the event of an attack, natural disaster, or other emergency.\" Achieving that national priority requires m eeting a series of objectives that include: understanding and sharing information about terrorist threats and other ha zards; building security partnerships; implementing a long-term risk ma nagement program; and maximizing the efficient use of resources. Measuring progress towa rd implementing the NIPP requires that CI/KR security partners have the following: \u0083 Coordinated, risk-based CI/KR plans a nd programs in place addressing known and potential threats; \u0083 Structures and processes that are flexible a nd adaptable, both to incorporate operational lessons learned and effective practices, and also to adapt quickly to a changing threat or incident environment; \u0083 Processes in place to identify and address de pendencies and interdependencies to allow for more timely and effective implementation of short-term protective actions and more rapid response and recovery; and \u0083 Access to robust information-shar ing networks that include re levant intelligence, threat analysis, and real-time incident reporting. The NIPP details actions to accomplish the following: 14 \u0083 Implement a risk management framework to guide CI/KR protection programs and activities; \u0083 Strengthen linkages between physical and cyber, as well as domestic and international CI/KR protection efforts; \u0083 Enhance and sustain information ector coordination; \u0083 all-hazards environment; \u0083 Integrate CI/KR protection as part of the homeland security mission; \u0083 Maximize efficient use of resources for CI/KR protection; and \u0083 Achieve an effective and efficient nationa l CI/KR protection progr am over the longer term. Sector-Specific Plans (SSPs) detail each sector 's specific approach for executing the NIPP risk management framework, including setting sector s ecurity supporting goals, inventorying assets, assessing risks, prioritizing assets, implemen ting protective programs, and measuring progress toward CI/KR protection.

Discussion: This national priority focuses on the Intelligence and Information Sharing and Dissemination and the Counter-Terror Investigati ons and Law Enforcement capabilities outlined in the TCL. It is also closel y linked to the national priority to Strengthen Interoperable and Operable Communications Capabilities (see Se ction 4.5). A common ope rating picture can only be achieved through a national information ma nagement system supported by an operational interoperable communications network. The Intelligence and Information Sharing and Di ssemination capability refers to the multi- jurisdictional, multidisciplinary exchange and dissemination of information and intelligence among entities at all levels of government, as well as nongovernment al organizations, the private sector, and citizens. Intelligence is derive d by gathering, analyzing, and fusing relevant information from a wide range of sources on a continual basis. Succe ssful homeland security efforts require a national information manageme nt system that provides an effective and seamless capability to gather, analyze, dissemi nate, and use information regarding threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences to support prevention and response efforts. As the response to 15 Hurricane Katrina demonstrated, prompt and e ffective information sh aring and reporting is essential for response activities. Successful re sponses are dependent upo n real-time, accurate situational awareness of both th e facts from the disaster area and ongoing response activities. Strengthened information sharing and collaboration capabilities will enable a more accurate situational awareness and allo w development of a real-time common operating picture. To support these efforts, government departments and agencies need a single reporting system (or system of systems) to ensure critical informa tion reaches the appropriate decision-makers and the public in a timely manner. The Law Enforcemen t Investigation and Operations Counter-Terror Investigations and Law Enforcem ent capability contributes to su ccessful deterrence, detection, disruption, investigation, and apprehension of suspects involved in terrorism and related criminal activities. Law enforcement and other appropriat e personnel must be part ners in the Intelligence and Information Sharing and Dissemination capability to conduct successful investigations. The President and the Congress have directed the creation of an Information Sharing Environment (ISE) to provide a nd facilitate the mean s for sharing terrorism information among all appropriate Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial governments, as well as private sector entities, through the issuance of policy guidelines and technol ogies. A number of Federal initiatives support this national priority, in cluding the following: \u0083 Establishment of an ISE Program Manager pos ition in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. On November 16, 2006, the Director of National Intelligence delivered the ISE Implementation Plan to th e Congress. The report provides a vision, strategy, and roadmap for developing a comprehensive implementation plan and outlines the activities to be undertaken by the ISE Program Manager, Fede ral departments and agencies, State, local, tribal, and territorial governments, a nd private sector entities. \u0083 Establishment of the Information Sharing a nd Collaboration Office within DHS to serve as the DHS focal point for information sh aring policy, coordination, and implementation both within DHS and with the Department's partners to achieve effective information sharing and collaboration. \u0083 Embedding intelligence and operational personnel from the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis in State and local fusion cen ters. These deployed professionals will facilitate the flow of timely, actionable, all-hazard information across State and local governments as well as the national intelligence and law enforcement communities. \u0083 Expansion of the Homeland Security Information Network, managed by DHS, to strengthen the real-time, collaborative information flow among homeland security partners. \u0083 Establishment of the Law Enforcement Info rmation Sharing Program, which provides data exchange services that enhance th e information-sharing capabilities of the Department of Justice (DOJ). One component of that capability is provided by the Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTF), led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The JTTF enhances communication, coordinati on, and cooperation among agencies at all levels of government representing intelligen ce, law enforcement, defense, diplomatic, public safety, and homeland security discip lines by providing a point of fusion for terrorism intelligence. Another component of this capability is provided by the Anti- 16 Terrorism Advisory Councils led by the U.S. Attorneys, which also facilitate information sharing among law enforcement organizati ons at all levels of government. Additional information on the Homeland Security Information Network can be found online at: http://www.dhs.gov/xinfoshare/programs/gc_1156888108137.shtm Additional information on FBI and related DOJ efforts in this area can be found online at: http://www.fbi.gov/terrorinfo/count errorism/waronterrorhome.htm Additional information on the ISE can be found online at: http://www.ise.gov 4.5 Strengthen Interoperable and Operable Communications Capabilities National Priority: Interoperable and operable communicat ions capabilities are developed to target levels in the States, tribal areas, territori es, and designated urban ar eas that are consistent with measures and metrics established in the TCL. Discussion: This national priority focuses on the communications capability from the TCL. Communications interoperability is the ability of public safety ag encies (including police, fire, EMS, etc.) and service agencies (including public works, transpor tation, hospitals, etc.) to talk within and across agencies and jurisdictions vi a radio and associated communications systems; exchange voice, data, and/or video with one an other on demand; and do so in real time, when needed, and when authorized. Prior disasters and emergencies, as well as Stat e and Urban Area Homeland Security Strategies and status reports on interope rable communications, have show n persistent shortfalls in achieving communications interoperability. These shortfalls dem onstrate a need for a national framework fostering the identification of comm unications requirements and definition of technical standards. State and local authoritie s, working in partnership with DHS, need to establish statewide interoperable communications plans and a national interoperability baseline to assess the current state of communications interoperability. Achieving interoperable communications and creating effective mechanis ms for sharing information are long-term projects that require Federal lead ership and a collaborat ive approach to planning that involves all levels of government as well as the private sector. DHS recently established the Office of Emerge ncy Communications (OEC) to integrate and coordinate the Department's interoperable co mmunications programs. OEC now manages the Interoperable Communications Technical Assi stance Program (ICTAP), the interoperable communications policy development component of SAFECOM, and the Integrated Wireless Network (IWN) program. ICTAP provi des direct technical assistance to State, local, tribal, and territorial emergency responders and public safety officials in coordination with the UASI grant program (see section 4.1 above). ICTAP leverages and works with other Fe deral, State, local, tribal, and territorial interoperability efforts to enhance the overall capacity for agencies and individuals to communicate. SAFECOM promotes, coordinates, and provides assistance to the efforts of Federal, State, local, tribal, and te rritorial public safety agencies to strengthen 17 interoperable communications capabilities. SAFECOM emphasizes a practitioner-driven approach in addressing communicat ions interoperability. IWN is a collaborative effort by the Departments of the Treasury, Justice, and Ho meland Security, to pr ovide a consolidated nationwide Federal wireless commun ications system with integrat ed services (voice, data, and multimedia) in support of first responder and homeland security missions. The Nationwide Interoperable Communications Ba seline Survey and Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan initiatives confirm that succe ssful interoperability li es in the development of governance structures, standard operating pro cedures, training and exer cises, and well-defined usage of interoperable communications.

Discussion: This national priority focuses on th ree capabilities from the TCL: CBRNE Detection; Explosive Device Response Operat ions; and Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) and Hazardous Materials Response and Decontamin ation. The National Security Strategy issued in March 2006 notes that there are few threats greater than a terrorist attack with WMD. CBRNE materials can be used as WMD to produce thousands of casualties in a single attack. The Nation's capability to detect and respond to such incidents is imperative. Because the potential number of terror ist targets is large, and the threats and means of delivery are varied, the Nation must develop a layered defense agai nst WMD. An effective CBRNE detection infrastructure will ensure CBRNE materials are ra pidly detected, identified, and safely managed at borders, critical locations, events, and incide nts. By their nature, CBRNE materials differ in detection and characterization methodologies. CBRNE response in cludes activities to address the immediate and short-term actions to preserve life, property, and the en vironment, as well as the social, economic, and political structure of th e community, State, and Nation. It is critical that all levels of government c oordinate the development of inte ragency response protocols prior to the deployment of detection technology. Additional response activ ities are required post- 18 release/detonation. The ability to rapidly decont aminate large numbers of affected persons is critical in preventing injury or death. This national priority leverages efforts throughout government to develop capabilities to detect, neutralize, contain, dismantle, and dispose of CBRNE materials, and decontaminate exposed personnel and property. State, local , tribal, and territori al agencies and thei r hazardous materials response teams are key players in early detection, response, and decontamination. At the Federal level, different departments and agencies are key players for aspects of CBRNE detection, response, and decontamination. These include the following: the Departments of Defense, Justice, Agriculture, Health and Human Se rvices, Energy, and Homeland Security; the Environmental Protection Agency; and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Additional information on the NRP as it re lates to CBRNE can be found online at: http://www.dhs.gov/nationalresponseplan 4.7 Strengthen Medical Surge and Mass Prophylaxis Capabilities National Priority: Medical surge and mass prophylaxis cap abilities are developed to target levels in the States, tribal areas, territories, a nd designated urban areas that are consistent with measures and metrics established in the TCL. Discussion: This national priority focuses on th e Medical Surge and Mass Prophylaxis capabilities outlined in the TCL. The Medica l Surge and Mass Prophylaxis capabilities are the first lines of response to biote rrorism, pandemic influenza, and other public health emergencies. The Medical Surge capability is prioritized because of the urgent need to enable our healthcare system, particularly hospitals, to handle large numbers of patie nts requiring immediate hospitalization following any type of incident. The ability to triage and provide decontamination when necessary is essential. Emergency-ready hospitals and other hea lthcare entities must be able to work collectively to handle different types of injuries, including physical and psychological trauma, burns, infections, bone marrow suppression, or other chemical- or radiation-induced injuries. Finally, in anticipa tion of a mass casualty incident that exceeds the aggregate surge capacity of local hospitals, th e community of medical providers must have provisions in place to immediatel y accommodate an influx of supplemental healthcare assets from mutual-aid partners, Stat es, and the Federal Government. The Mass Prophylaxis capability requires public health departments to organize and direct a mass prophylaxis campaign within an extremely short timeframe, should one be needed to prevent illness and/or death in the face of a potential or actual mass casualt y incident. A mass prophylaxis campaign would require more staff than what is normally available at a public health department to fulfill all functional roles. Therefore, it is critical to i nvolve other staffing sources (e.g., first responders, nongovernmental organizations, and volunteers) in the campaign. Th e Cities Readiness Initiat ive is a pilot project to assist cities in increasing th eir capacity to deliver medicines and supplies for mass prophylaxis during a large-scale public health emergency (see Section 4.1). HHS provides many Federal programs that support this priori ty. Two of the 12 HHS readine ss objectives for State and local public health emergency preparedness support this priority. The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 addresses the need to enhance public 19 health and healthcare readiness for bioterrorism and other public health emergencies. The Nation needs emergency-ready public health and healthcare services in every community as a first line of response to such threats. Also, as envisioned in the NRP and \" Biodefense for the 21st Century ,\" the Nation needs to strengthen Federal capabilities (such as the Nation al Disaster Medical System and the Strategic National Stockpile) to assist and augment State, local, tribal, and territorial emergency response efforts as necessary, especially in responding to mass casualty in cidents. Within HHS, the Office of the Secretary administers the Nationa l Bioterrorism Hospital Preparedness Program. This program enhances the ability of the Nation' s hospitals and the healthcare system to prepare for and respond to bioterrorism and other public health emergencies. The CDC administers the Cooperative Agreement on Public Health Prepar edness and Response for Bioterrorism. CDC funds are intended to upgrade Stat e and local public health jurisdictions' preparedness for and response to the priorities identifi ed in authorizing legislation. Additional information on HHS readine ss priorities can be found online at: http://www.hhs.gov/ophep/npgs.html Additional information on Medica l Surge can be found online at: http://www.hrsa.gov/bioterrorism/ Additional information on Mass Prophylaxis can be found on the CDC Coordinating Office of Terrorism Preparedness and Emergency Response website at: http:// www.bt.cdc.gov 4.8 Community Preparedness: Strengthenin g Planning and Citizen Capabilities National Priority: Planning and citizen preparedness capabilit ies are developed to target levels in the States, tribal areas, territo ries, and designated urban areas that are consistent with measures and metrics established in the TCL. Discussion: This national priority focuses on the Planning, Citizen Evacua tion and Shelter-in- Place, Mass Care (sheltering, feeding, and rela ted services), and Community Preparedness and Participation capabilities from the TCL. Hurri cane Katrina demonstrated not only the need for renewed emphasis on planning capabilities, especially emergency operations planning, but also on citizen preparedness. In a speech from Jackson Square in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, President Bush highlighted emergency pl anning as a \"national secu rity priority.\" The Nation's homeland security system is highly complex, with multiple objectives, partners, and needs. Plans help make sense of this comple x homeland environment. Planning is a methodical way to think through the entire life-cycle of a potential crisis. G ood planning repays the investment of time and effort in development a nd rehearsal by shortening the time required to gain control over an incident and by providing favorable cond itions for rapid and effective exchange of information about a situation, its analysis, and alternative responses. Planning helps Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial governments reorient capabilities and resources to be more agile and ensures organizational structures , processes, and procedures effectively support the intended strategic direction. As stakeholders learn and practice their roles, they can reduce 20 uncertainty, expedite response, a nd improve effectiveness during th e critical initial stages after an event. This effort is a key to succe ss in protecting people and property in crises. The DHS Appropriations Act of 2006 directed DH S to complete a comprehensive nationwide review of catastrophic planning, including planni ng for mass evacuations, sheltering, and related services. DHS completed the Nationwide Plan Review in June 2006. The first phase of the effort included analysis and reporting from St ates, territories, and urban areas regarding the status of their plans, including when their plans were last upda ted and their confidence in the plans to manage a catastrophic even t. The second phase involved a peer review, validation of the self-assessments, determination of requirements for planning assi stance, and identification of initial conclusions for strengthening plans for cata strophic events. The Nationwide Plan Review was an initial step in establishing a shared co ntingency planning process to develop sound plans that describe in detail how Federal, State, and local governments will jointly accomplish their respective missions and employ the full range of capab ilities at their disposal to achieve overall national objectives. As uniformed emergency responders constitute le ss than one percent of the total U.S. population, it is clear that citizens must be better prepared, tr ained, and practiced on how best to take care of themselves and assist others in those first, crucial hours during and after a catastrophic incident. Citizens can reduce th e demand for emergency assistance during catastrophic incidents through preparedness measures a nd actively contribute to the Nation's response capability by participating in response and rec overy activities. A trained and involved p ublic will provide the Nation with a critical surge capacity to augment government efforts in a catastrophic incident. During Hurricane Katrina, many c itizens exercised appropriate precautionary and response actions and many citizens volunteered to support the response and r ecovery efforts. In February 2006, the White House released \" The Federal Response to Hurricane Katrina: Lessons Learned,\" which emphasizes that \"citizen and co mmunity preparedness are among the most effective means of preventing terrorist attack s, as well as protecting against, mitigating, responding to, and recovering from all hazards. . . .[i]f every family developed their own emergency preparedness plan, they almost certainly would reduce the demand for outside emergency resources.\" Through the Ready Campaign and the nationwide network of State and local Citizen Corps Councils, DHS will focus on strengthening citizen pr eparedness capabilities, particularly for special needs and socially vulnerable populations.

The System must also incorporate the private sector, nongovernmental organizations, faith-based groups, and communities, including individual citizens.\" - The Federal Response to Hurricane Ka trina, Lessons Learned, February 2006 The National Preparedness System provides a wa y to organize preparedness activities and programs pursuant to the National Preparedness Guidelines (see Figure 6). The desired end- state of our National Preparedness System is to achieve and sustain c oordinated capabilities to prevent, protect against, respond t o, and recover from all hazards in a way that balances risk with resources. Figure 6: National Preparedness System The National Preparedness System provides oppo rtunities for all levels of government, the private sector, nongovernmental or ganizations, and individual ci tizens to work together to achieve priorities and capabilities outlined in the Guidelines . Many actions will be concurrent. They are described below in order of sequence: \u0083 Policy and Doctrine involves ongoing management and maintenance of national policy and doctrine for operations and preparedness, such as the NIMS, NRP, NIPP, and the Guidelines . 22 \u0083 Planning and Resource Allocation involves application of common planning processes and tools by government officials, worki ng with the private s ector, nongovernmental organizations, and individual citizens to iden tify requirements, allocate resources, and build and maintain coordinated capabilitie s that are prioritized based upon risk. \u0083 Training, Exercises, and Lessons Learned involves delivery of training and exercises and performance evaluation to identify less ons learned and share effective practices. \u0083 Assessment and Reporting involves assessments based on established readiness metrics and reporting on progress and effectiveness of efforts to achieve the vision of the Guidelines . 6.0 MANAGEMENT AND MAINTENANCE Because the Guidelines will be implemented over time through a wide range of preparedness programs and activities, they do not include spec ific implementation instructions (guidance on institutionalizing the Guidelines is within the Letter of Instru ction at Appendix A). Guidance on Guidelines implementation will also be supported by changes in requirements for receiving Federal preparedness assistance, annual Federal program guidance, and Federal regulations, to the extent permitted by law. Many programs and activities are already consistent with the Guidelines and simply need to be implemented in closer coordination. Other partners might need to initiate or reorient programs and in itiatives (along with m easurable objectives) to implement the Guidelines . Implementation and partner feedback will inform future refinements to the Guidelines . DHS will coordinate the establishment of a national-level structure and process for the ongoing management and maintenance of the Guidelines . This will be closely coordinated with similar structures and processes for the NIMS, NRP, NIPP, and other elements of the National Preparedness Syst em in order to help ensure national policy and planning for operations and preparedness are mutually supportive. DHS is committed to working with its homeland security partners in updating and maintaining the Guidelines and related documents as part of a uni fied National Preparedness System, which will help ensure coordinated strategies, plans, procedures, policies, training, and capabilities at all levels of government. Implementation of the National Preparedness System is well under way. It is building on assessments of risk, deve lopment of management policies and strategies, identification of specific missions and supporting ta sks in comprehensive plans, and matching of capabilities against requirements to execute these policies, strategies , and plans. Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial govern ments will participate in assessmen ts of readiness on a regular basis. The National Preparedness System will em phasize feedback and periodic reassessment to ensure the current state of prepar edness is based on readiness metric s and is used as the basis for policy and programmatic decisions. HSPD-8 requi res the Secretary of Homeland Security to provide to the President annual status reports on the Nation's le vel of preparedness, including State capabilities, the readiness of Federal civil response assets, th e utilization of mutual aid, and an assessment of how Federal preparedness programs support the Guidelines . These reports will contribute to updates of the Guidelines . 23 THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK 24 APPENDIX A - LETTER OF INSTRUCTION The National Preparedness Guidelines ( Guidelines) are formally established upon issuance and supersede the Interim National Prepare dness Goal issued on March 31, 2005. The Guidelines provide an overarching vision, to ols, and priorities to shap e national preparedness. The Guidelines do not include an implementation plan; implementation will occur over time through a wide range of Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial prep aredness programs and activities. For example, Federal program offices will develop detailed plans that describe how their programs support Guidelines implementation in consultation w ith their stakeholders. Those details must be reflected in annual program guidan ce, in the form of meas urable objectives and requirements. DHS will monitor those efforts an d advise program offices and DHS leadership on progress and opportunities to improve synchr onization. Implementation and feedback will inform future refinement of the Guidelines. Requirements This section outlines roles and responsibilities of Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial governments, nongovernmental organi zations, the private sector, and citizens in implementing the preparedness framework outlined by the Guidelines . Specifically, this section provides examples of potential activities for the purpose of outlining the way forward. Guidelines implementation will also be supported by changes in requirements for receiving Federal preparedness assistance, annual Federal program gui dance, and Federal regul ations to the extent permitted by law. Many programs and activities are already consistent with the Guidelines and simply need to be implemented in closer coordi nation. Nothing in HSPD-8 alters or impedes the ability of government officials to pe rform their responsibilities under law. Department of Homeland Security As the lead for implementation of the preparedness framework outlined by the Guidelines , DHS shall do the following: \u0083 Coordinate the establishment of a management and maintenance structur e and process for the Guidelines , including the Capabilities-Based Prepare dness tools and the assessment system; \u0083 As outlined in HSPD-8, coordinate consistency with the Guidelines among Federal departments and agencies associated with the following: - Federal preparedness assistance; - First responder equipment standards; - Preparedness research and development activities; - Federal training programs; - National Exercise Program; - Interagency planning processes; - Performance measurements for national preparedness; - Relevant Federal regulat ory requirements; and - Federal assets in support of State, local, territorial, and tribal government operations. 25 \u0083 Address other HSPD-8 requirements, as appropriate. State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial Gov ernments and Nongovernmental Organizations State, local, tribal, and territorial governments and nongovernmental organizations are encouraged to do the following: \u0083 Participate in the development and implement ation of the management and maintenance structure and process for the Guidelines , including the Capabilities- Based Preparedness tools and the assessment system; \u0083 Participate in Guidelines implementation by ascertaining th eir capability levels and their respective requirements, and by consulting in the developm ent of program plans and guidance documents; \u0083 Adopt a step-by-step capability preparedness process similar to that described in Appendix B to ensure that their respective homeland secur ity programs are administered in a manner that is consistent with the Guidelines and enhance the National Priorities; \u0083 Participate in regional initiatives to identify a nd synchronize the availa bility of existing and future capabilities that may be access ible through mutual aid agreements; \u0083 Define appropriate support roles for employees to perform as emergency staff to fulfill capabilities, and support the development and ma intenance of an inventory of capabilities; and \u0083 Address other HSPD-8 requirements as appropriate. Private Sector As stated in HSPD-8, appropria te private sector entities are encouraged to do the following: \u0083 Incorporate the safety and secu rity of people and assets into business plans and corporate strategies; \u0083 Participate in the development and implement ation of the management and maintenance structure and process for the Guidelines , including the Capabilities- Based Preparedness tools and the assessment system; \u0083 Participate in Guidelines implementation by determining requirements and achieving capabilities, and by consulting in the de velopment of program plans and guidance documents; \u0083 Participate in State, local, tribal, territoria l, and regional planning and assessment processes to comply with the Guidelines and TCL; and \u0083 Address other HSPD-8 requirements as appropriate. As stated in HSPD-7, private sector entit ies are encouraged to do the following: 26 \u0083 Work with the relevant Sector-Specific Agenci es to identify, prioriti ze, and coordinate the protection of critical infrastr ucture and key resources in conformance with the National Infrastructure Protection Plan; and \u0083 Share information about physical and cyber thre ats, vulnerabilities, incidents, potential protective measures, and effective practices. Federal Departments and Agencies To support the Federal role in implementing the preparedness framework outlined in the Guidelines , Federal departments and agencies (i ncluding DHS) shall do the following: \u0083 Support and participate in the management and maintenance structure and process developed for the Guidelines, associated tools, and Capabil ities-Based Preparedness process; \u0083 Initiate or re-orient programs and initiatives (along with measurable objectives) to implement the Guidelines . The following step-by-step proce ss is suggested for use by Federal departments and agencies to ensure that their respective homeland security assistance programs are administered in a manner that is consistent with the Guidelines and enhances the National Priorities. This process descripti on will be refined over time with user feedback and supplemented with specific instructions, if necessary and if requested. This process is not intended to substitute or impede depart ment or agency autonomy for determining how individual programs and initiatives will be modified to help implement the Guidelines : o Step 1: Analyze the Guidelines and Identify Applicable Programs - Review the Guidelines to understand the intent, direc tion, and requirements for national preparedness. Identify preparedness pr ograms - including initiatives to address Hurricane Katrina Lessons Learned - that are applicable to the Guidelines . A program or initiative is applicable to the Guidelines if its objectives support any of the National Priorities or the capabilities identified in the TCL. Applicable programs and initiatives may consist of grants, training, exercises, e quipment, technical a ssistance, and response capabilities to Federal, State, local, tribal, terr itorial, nongovernmental, or private sector entities. Departments and agencies will periodically update a nd communicate to DHS (as requested) this inventory of programs a nd initiatives, along with their status in supporting the Guidelines . This information will be used for the Annual Report to the President on National Preparedness; o Step 2: Assess Program and Guidelines Consistency - Assess the services provided by each applicable program or initiative to determine th eir consistency with the Guidelines . Details on relevant programs and initiatives should be shared and coordinated with DHS and the Homeland Security Council (HSC) to ensure an integrated approach and action plan for Guidelines implementation. The HSC is re sponsible for coordinating the development of national homela nd security policy. DHS, with oversight from the HSC, is responsible for coordinating the deve lopment and implementation of homeland security program plans and annual program guidance among Federal departments and agencies. Compliant Federal programs sha ll define interconnected and complementary objectives, timelines, and requirement s designed to synchronize with the Guidelines ; 27 o Step 3: Align Guidelines Implementation with Budget and Program Schedules - To the greatest extent possible, Federal department s and agencies should modify applicable program plans and policies to be consistent with the Guidelines . Federal departments and agencies should notify DHS of program reforms that cannot be completed in the upcoming budget cycle and shoul d begin the process for implementing reforms in future- year budget cycles in a manner that compor ts with their overall mission priorities; o Step 4: Modify Applicable Programs - Each applicable program should conform its operations to be consistent with the Guidelines . Conformance with the Guidelines may warrant reforms to the administration, goals, objectives, accompanying guidance, published materials, permitted uses, application process, award criteria, and other components of the applicable program. Conformance will also necessitate the integration of quantifiable preparedness and performance measures outlined in the TCL within relevant applicable programs - includ ing applications, award criteria, and project evaluations - to monitor the progress of the program and its beneficiaries to advance the Guidelines . Federal departments and agencies should modify application and award processes to adopt the Capabilities-Based Preparedness process (S ee Appendix B) and to monitor and report the applic ation of applicable home land security programs in furtherance of the priorities a nd capabilities set forth in the Guidelines and TCL; o Step 5: Notify Stakeholders - As soon as it is practicable, notify all appropriate partners and beneficiaries of the applicable preparedness and response programs about the reforms and their corresp onding relationship to the Guidelines , TCL, and national initiatives. Such notice may also include a solicitation of comments and suggestions for future changes to the Guidelines and TCL; o Step 6: Maintenance - Monitor the administration of th e applicable programs to ensure that they support the Guidelines. Participate in the DHS management and maintenance process by submitting suggestions and comme nts to DHS. Comments may include any function of reforming applicable programs to the Guidelines and should specifically identify inconsistencies with other ongoing initiatives, implementation difficulties, and recommended modifications to the TCL to en sure that it represents the most current means of measuring national prep aredness. Agencies should identify how relevant data on program priorities, performance measur es, and capability assessments will be collected and integrated with national reporting efforts; \u0083 Support the development and maintenance of an inventory of Federal programs that support capabilities outlined in the Guidelines ; and \u0083 Address other HSPD-8 requirements as appropriate. 28 Citizens As directed in HSPD-8, DHS will work w ith all levels of government, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector to encourag e active citizen participation and involvement in preparedness. DHS along with Federal, State, lo cal, tribal and territorial governments, and private and nonprofit sectors should focus on efforts to accomplish the following: \u0083 Integrate and institutionalize citiz en participation in all homela nd security efforts nationwide; \u0083 Support a culture of preparedness by fostering collaboration and integration of all community resources (citizens, nongovernmental organi zations, private sector, and faith-based organizations) with preparedness efforts at all levels of government through mechanisms, such as Citizen Corps Councils, to conduct awar eness and outreach campaigns to deliver the message of personal responsibil ity to \"prepare, train, and vo lunteer,\" and to motivate all Americans to take action to reduce their vulnerability and increase resilience; \u0083 Encourage citizen training and volunteer opportu nities through program s such as Community Emergency Response Teams, Medical Reserve Corps, Fire Corps, Volunteers in Police Service, Neighborhood Watch, Citizens' Acad emy, Ready Kids, and Ready Business; \u0083 Focus on special needs populations, such as people with disabilities, language and cultural differences, economic barriers, and age-related issues and concerns; \u0083 Develop standards, recognition in centives, and assessment and ev aluation criteria for citizen preparedness and participation; \u0083 Share lessons learned and effective practi ces from communities around the country; and \u0083 Identify Cabinet Secretaries and other prominen t public figures to serve as spokespersons to promote citizen and community preparedness. 29 APPENDIX B - CAPABILITIES-BAS ED PREPAREDNESS OVERVIEW The National Preparedness Guidelines (Guidelines ) are supported by a capabilities-based approach to planning for major ev ents. Capabilities-Based Preparedness is a form of all-hazards planning. This Appendix provides an overview of Capabilities-Based Preparedness and outlines a process that Federal, State, regional, and local prepare dness programs can utilize as Capabilities-Based Preparedness is adopted and ins titutionalized nationwide. It is organized into three sections: 1. Definition 2. Planning Tools Referenced in the Guidelines 3. Capabilities-Based Preparedness Process 1. Definition Capabilities-Based Preparedness is defined as: ...preparing, under uncertainty, to provid e capabilities suitable for a wide range of challenges while working within an economic framework that necessitates prioritization and choice. Capabilities-Based Preparedness is a way to make informed choices about how to manage the risk and reduce the impact posed by potential th reats. It focuses decision making on building and maintaining capabilities to prevent and protect against challenges (e.g., intelligence analysis, critical infrastructure protection, etc.) and to respond and recover when events occur (e.g., onsite incident management, medical surge, emergenc y public information, and economic recovery). The process rests on a foundation of multi-disc iplinary, cross-governmental, and regional collaboration to determine measurable capability ta rgets, to assess current levels of capabilities, and to find ways to close the gaps. As entit ies make choices in preparedness programs and activities, they will be able to improve their own preparedness , focus available assistance on areas of greatest need, and co llaborate with others using a common reference framework. Capabilities are defined as providing: ...the means to accomplish a mission or function and achieve desired outcomes by performing critical tasks, under specified co nditions, to target levels of performance. The 37 capabilities referenced in the Guidelines span the full spectrum of homeland security missions. While the listing does not yet encompass every function that must be accomplished to prevent, protect against, res pond to, or recover from a major event, it nonetheless offers a comprehensive starting point for planning. Each cap ability is described in detail in the Target Capabilities List (TCL), which accompanies the Guidelines . The description includes a definition, outcome, preparedness and perfor mance activities, tasks, and measures. 30 2. Planning Tools Referenced in the Guidelines The National Preparedness Guidelines utilize and reference th ree Capabilities-Based Preparedness tools: the National Planning Scen arios, the TCL, and the Universal Task List (UTL). National Planning Scenarios While preparedness applies across the all-haza rds spectrum, the 2002 National Strategy for Homeland Security attaches special emphasis to preparing for catastrophic threats with \"the greatest risk of mass casualties, massive propert y loss, and immense social disruption.\" To illustrate the potential scope, magnitude, and complexity of a range of major events, the Homeland Security Council\u2014in part nership with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), other Federal departments and agencies, and St ate, local, tribal, and territorial governments\u2014 developed the National Planning Sc enarios. The 15 Scenarios include terrorist attacks, major disasters, and other emergencies. They are listed in Figure B-1. Figure B-1: National Planning Scenarios National Planning Scenarios Improvised Nuclear Device Major Earthquake Aerosol Anthrax Major Hurricane Pandemic Influenza Radiological Dispersal Device Plague Improvised Explosive Device Blister Agent Food Contamination Toxic Industrial Chemicals Foreign Animal Disease Nerve Agent Cyber Attack Chlorine Tank Explosion All levels of government can us e the National Planning Scenarios as a reference to explore the potential consequences of major events and to ev aluate and improve their capabilities to perform their assigned missions and tasks. Planners are not precluded from developing their own scenarios to supplement the National Planning Scenarios. DHS will maintain a National Planning Scenario portfolio and update it periodi cally based on changes in the homeland security strategic environment. The current version is available on the Office of Domestic Preparedness (ODP) Secure Portal ( https://odp.esportals.com ) and the Lessons Learned Information Sharing system ( https://www.llis.dhs.gov ). Use of specific National Pl anning Scenarios in federally funded training and exercises will be addressed in program guidance. Target Capabilities List The TCL identifies and defines capabilities that the Nation may need to achieve and sustain, depending on relevant risks and threats, in order to be prepared. A capability may be delivered with any combination of properly planned, organi zed, equipped, trained, and exercised personnel that achieves the desired outcome. Entities are expected to develop and maintain capabilities at levels that reflect the differing ri sk and needs acro ss the country. 31 Each capability includes a description of the majo r activities performed with in the capability and the critical tasks and measures associated with the activity. Critical tasks are those tasks that must be performed during a major event in orde r to minimize the impact on lives, property, and the economy. Critical tasks may require coordi nation among Federal, State, local, tribal, territorial, private sector, and/ or nongovernmental entities during their execution. They are essential to achieving the desired outcome and to the success of a homeland security mission. The critical tasks are derived from the tasks f ound in the UTL. Critical tasks, when linked to operating conditions and performance standard s, provide the primar y source of learning objectives for training and exerci ses and provide input to planni ng and performance evaluation. Operating conditions are variables of the environment, such as the terrain, weather, presence of an adversary, and complexity of multi-agency relationships, that may affect performance. The TCL includes measures and metrics that are quan titative or qualitative levels against which achievement of a task or capability outcome can be assessed. Planners at all levels of government can use th e TCL as a reference to help them design plans, procedures, training, and exercise s that develop capacity and proficiency to perform their assigned missions and tasks in major events. The TCL was developed with Federal, State, and local subject-matter experts and drew on existing sources wherever possible. It will be updated periodically in conjuncti on with the UTL. The current vers ion is available on the ODP secure portal ( https://odp.esportals.com ) and the Lessons Learned Information Sharing system (https://www.llis.dhs.gov ). Universal Task List The UTL provides a menu of tasks required to prev ent, protect against, respond to, and recover from major events represented by the National Pl anning Scenarios. Most tasks are common to many, if not all, of the Scenarios, as well as ot her events not covered by the Scenarios. The UTL serves as a common language and reference sy stem that will support efforts to describe operational tasks, so that personnel from across the Nation can work together effectively when required. No single entity is exp ected to perform every task. The UTL was developed with Federal, State, lo cal, tribal, territorial , private sector, and nongovernmental subject-matter experts and drew on existing sources wherever possible. The UTL will be updated periodically in conjunction with the TCL. The current version is available on the ODP secure portal ( https://odp.esportals.com ) and the Lessons Learned Information Sharing system ( https://www.llis.dhs.gov ). 3. Capabilities-Based Preparedness Process The Capabilities-Based Preparedness process (see Figure B-2) invol ves homeland security partners in a systematic and prioritized effort to accomplish the following: \u0083 Convene working groups; \u0083 Determine capability requirements; \u0083 current capability levels; \u0083 Identify, analyze, and choose options; 32 \u0083 Update plans and strategies; \u0083 Allocate funds; \u0083 Update and execute program plans; and \u0083 Assess and report. The process emphasizes collaboration to identify, ach ieve, and sustain target levels of capability that will contribute to enhanci ng overall national levels of prep aredness. This simple, step-by- step sequence illustrates how processes and tools are combined to identify and prioritize measurable preparedness targets in assessing cu rrent capabilities, then allocating available resources and emphasis to the most urgently needed capabilities based on risk. DHS will refine this description over time with user feedback and supplement it with sp ecific instructions in annual program guidance. Figure B-2: Capabilities-Based Preparedness Process 33 Step 1: Convene Working Group The preparedness process should begin with form ation of a chartered, representative working group. It is strongly encouraged that, wherever possible, previously established working groups be used for this process. The working group should be multi-disciplinary, multi-agency, and multi-jurisdictional. Where appropriate, working groups should include the private sector and nongovernmental partners. The intent is to bri ng together regional practitioners from across disciplines so that they can be effective advisors to the senior decisi on-makers who formulate strategies, set pr iorities, and allocate funds. Step 2: Determine Capability Targets The working group will determine risk-based target levels for each capability by reviewing the TCL and conducting risk analysis. Such target levels must bala nce risk with resources - both resources that are currently available and those th at can realistically be acquired through regional collaboration. The TCL provides a series of examples of how capabilities may apply to jurisdictions of different sizes. These examples are intended to provide guidance on how the target levels listed in individual capabilities vary based on the regi on and implementing agency. It is important to keep in mind that any combination of elements (or resources) that delivers the desired outcome is acceptable. The TCL is not intended to direct specific resource requirements for every agency or jurisdiction for each year, nor is it descriptive of all of the resources neces sary for every type of scenario. Step 3: Assess Current Capability Levels The core of the Capabilities-Based Prepare dness approach is the comparison of current capabilities with risk-based ta rget capability levels. The working group will coordinate an assessment of the current levels of capability. Capability assessments measure the current level of capability against the target levels of capability from the TC L applicable to the respective level of government. Comparisons will re veal \"gaps\" (implying outcomes cannot be accomplished with current capabilities), \"exces ses\" (unnecessary redundancies or no longer needed capabilities), and \"deficienc ies\" (an existing capability that is insufficient to provide a reasonable assurance of success agai nst a specified scenario). Some of the required capabilities and expertise will not be present in the Stat e or jurisdiction. Many will be secured through regional multi-agency coordination (i.e., mutu al aid, acquisition through contracting, and resources from nongovernmental and private sector partners). Step 4: Identify, Analyze, and Choose Options Capabilities-Based Preparedness al so involves selecting methods to address capability gaps and deficiencies. This step involves translating a capability gap or defi ciency into specific needs and determining a combination of resources to fulfill the need. Analytical processes using comparative, trade-off, and risk analyses are ap plied in this step. Recognizing that there is usually more than one resource combination that can address a capability gap or deficiency, the analysis includes identifying, analyzing, and choosing options, using the recommended resources identified in the TCL as a guide. This analysis provides senior decision- makers with alternative 34 combinations of resources or solution sets for each capability gap or deficiency. Analysis components are described below. Identify Options. The range of options identified should be kept to a manageable number, but solutions should be framed in terms of the elements required to implement a capability. A capability may be delivered with any combination of properly planned, organized, equipped, trained, and exercised personnel th at achieves the desired outcome. In reviewing options, the effectiveness of applying mutual aid among geog raphic regions and levels of government should be considered. Analyze Options. Once a range of options has been identified, each option should be analyzed and prioritized against a standard set of criteria. The analysis will determine the combination of resources that could provide the desired capabilit y or capabilities and will appropriately address risk. Examples of criteria include the following: \u0083 Ability of the identified approaches to provide the desired capability. Due to prior investments, it may not be necessary to invest in all six elements (see Figure 3 on page 5 of the Guidelines ) at one time in order to achieve a capability; \u0083 Ability of the approaches to deliver the total capability. If an approach cannot deliver the total capability, evaluate how much of the capability can be met; \u0083 Delivery time frame; \u0083 Relative improvement in capability level provi ded by the approaches as compared to the existing capability; and \u0083 Cost to develop, procure, and su stain the approaches versus th e cost to sustain the existing capability. Choose Options. The results of the analysis are pres ented to senior decision-makers for consideration. Risk determinations are embedded in the decision-making process. Risk determinations will consider the range of capab ility gaps, excesses, and deficiencies; issues identified during analysis (as id entified in the analyze options component crit eria); and strategic concerns and implications. Risk determin ations will also consider the following: \u0083 Can the capability outcome be accomplished and provide a reasonable assurance of success? \u0083 What are the potential costs compared to ot her options? Are the costs and time required appropriate for the benefit gained? \u0083 What is the impact on planning? Is the soluti on compatible with other solutions available through assistance programs, and can mutual ai d be applied to meet the requirement? By applying known constraints a nd examining all capabilities, a preferred solution set can be selected. The results can then be consolidated into a prioritized, balanced portfolio across all relevant capabilities. 35 Step 5: Update Plans and Strategies Once options are chosen, working groups can up date their emergency operations plans and preparedness strategies. The stra tegies should be aligned with the National Preparedness Guidelines and support and facilitate re gional cooperation and mutual aid. Strategies are multi- year planning vehicles supported by specific an nual work plans that describe each year's approach to meeting the longer term strategy. Regional mutual aid agreements should be updated or revised, funding request s should identify prioritized resource needs, and existing resources should be reallocated, as appr opriate, to close capability gaps. Step 6: Allocate Resources Decision-makers will lead a review of budgets, existing resources, and funding requests and map these to current or potential sources of fundi ng. Using Capabilities-Based Preparedness, their aim is to produce an effective and regionally coordinated preparedness portfolio within each jurisdiction and, as a consequen ce, across the Nation. Ultimate ly, balancing the preparedness portfolio will contribute to a more prep ared Nation by accomplishing the following: \u0083 Maximizing the return on preparedness inve stments and resources in compliance with homeland security strategies and in coordination with the National Preparedness Guidelines ; \u0083 Providing clarity in resource allocation decisions based on consisten tly applied criteria and decision-making frameworks; and \u0083 Encouraging a regional and/or mutual aid partner approach to national preparedness. Step 7: Update and Execute Program Plans The strategies and plans previously devel oped and/or updated are implemented through the execution step. All relevant stakeholders carry out annual work plans. Execution focuses on the following: \u0083 Administering programs; \u0083 Conducting planning and coordination; \u0083 Purchasing equipment in accordance with docum ented needs and specified standards, as well as preparing and maintaining such equi pment to be readily available as needed; \u0083 Developing and conducting training to fill capability gaps; and \u0083 Developing and conducting exercises to demonstrate performance. The following example describes how Step 7 applies to Training and Exercises. 36 Capabilities-Based Preparedne ss for Training and Exercises \u0083 Review relevant strategy and policy to identify priority TCL capabilities to be trained for and exercised against \u0083 Develop a Multi-Year Training and Exer cise Plan and Schedule for intended training and exercise activities \u0083 Per the Multi-Year Schedule, carry ou t planned training ac tivities oriented toward augmenting priority TCL capabilities \u0083 Conduct exercises that apply and evalua te the priority TCL capabilities developed through training \u0083 Use a \"building-block cycle\" of es calating exercise complexity (e.g., tabletop exercise, followed by a drill, followed by a full-scale exercise) to incrementally build priority TCL capability levels \u0083 Evaluate capabilities test ed in exercises using Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program Exercise Evaluation Guides linked to each TCL capability \u0083 Update Multi-Year Plan annually to re flect new priority capabilities and lessons learned from exercises For more on Capabilities-Based Preparedness Planning for training and exercises, see Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program Volume I: Overview and Exercise Program Management ( http://hseep.dhs.gov ). Step 8: Assess and Report An assessment process provides a continuously validated baseline fo r preparedness. Capability, compliance, and performance assessments provide the basis to determine preparedness of individual partners and levels of government, the synthesis of which produces a national assessment of preparedness. Capability assessmen ts are discussed in Step 3. Other types of assessments include performance and compliance assessments. Performance and compliance assessments serve to validate levels of capability. Compliance assessments will provide insight into conformance with requirements (e.g., NIMS and other national programs). Performance assessments are conducted through exercise programs. Assessments are performed on a regular basis. Information from these assessments provides comprehensive indicators for how effectively capa bilities are achieved and maintained within the assessed region. The results of these assessments will be presented to relevant decision-makers for use as a mechanism to develop subsequent gu idance. Analysis from assessments will enable 37 relevant decision-makers to ensure the appropria te balance of resources allocated to strengthen specific capabilities. The synthesis of analyses will help to develop a comprehensive \"snapshot\" of preparedness. In addition to State and local efforts, overall pr ogress towards increasing the national level of preparedness will be documented and communi cated through a national reporting cycle and Annual Status Report. The desired end-state is to implement th e vision of preparedness defined in the National Preparedness Guidelines and to coordinate homeland security capabilities across jurisdictions and disciplines. Information from Capabilities-Based Preparedness will be used by preparedness programs at all levels of government to refine pr ogram structures and stra tegies. This requires understanding capability need s at the national level th rough analysis of data collected nationwide. Results will be used to update the national priorities in the Guidelines and to provide enhanced strategic direction for the Nation. Achieving national preparedness hinges on using a flexible, all-hazards process that provides common objectives, priorities, a nd standards.

(Source: Community-Based Mass Prophylaxis - A Planning Guide for Public Health Preparedness, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, August 2004) Measures and Metrics. Performance measures of quantitative or qualitative levels against which achievement of a task or capability outcome can be asse ssed. They describe how much, how well, and/or how quickly an action should be performed and are typi cally expressed in way that can be observed during an exercise or re al event. The measures and metrics are not standards. They serve as guides for planni ng, training, and exercise activities. However, nationally accepted standards of performance, benchmarks, and guidelines are reflected, if applicable. (Source: Target Capabilities List, March 2007) Mitigation . The activities designed to reduce or elim inate risks to persons or property or to lessen the actual or potential effects or consequen ces of an incident. Mitigation measures may be implemented prior to, during, or after an incide nt. Mitigation measures are often informed by lessons learned from prior incidents. Mitigat ion involves ongoing actions that reduce exposure to, probability of, or potential loss from hazar ds. Measures may include zoning and building codes, floodplain buyouts, and analysis of hazard-related data to determine where it is safe to build or locate temporary facili ties. Mitigation can include efforts to educate governments, 41 businesses, and the public on measures they can take to reduce loss and injury. (Source: NIMS, March 2004) National. Of a nationwide character, including the Fe deral, State, local, tribal, and territorial aspects of governance and polic y. (Source: NIMS, March 2004) Preparedness. The range of deliberate, critical tasks and activities necessar y to build, sustain, and improve the operational capabil ity to prevent, protect agains t, respond to, and recover from domestic incidents. Preparedne ss is a continuous process. Prep aredness involves efforts at all levels of government and coordination among government, private-sector, and nongovernmental organizations to identify threats, determine vul nerabilities, and identify required resources. Within the NIMS, preparedness is operationally focused on establishing guidelines, protocols, and standards for planning, training and exer cises, personnel qualific ation and certification, equipment certification, and publication ma nagement. (Source: NIMS, March 2004) Prevention. Actions to avoid an incident or to in tervene to stop an incident from occurring. Prevention involves actions taken to protect lives and property. It involves applying intelligence and other information to a range of activities that may include such countermeasures as deterrence operations; heightened inspections; improved surveillance and security operations; investigations to determine the full nature and source of the threat; public health and agricultural surveillance and testing processe s; immunizations, isolation, or quarantine; and, as appropriate, specific law enforcement operations aimed at deterring, preempting, interdicting, or disrupting illegal activity and apprehendi ng potential perpetrators and bri nging them to justice. Under HSPD-8, the National Preparedness Guidelines do not address more general and broader prevention efforts to deter, disrupt, or thwart terrorism by Federal law enforcement, defense, and intelligence agencies. (Source: NIMS, March 2004; HSPD-8, December 17, 2003) Protection. Actions to reduce the vulnerability of cr itical infrastructure or key resources in order to deter, mitigate, or neutralize terrorist atta cks, major disasters, and other emergencies. It requires coordinated action on the part of Federa l, State, and local governments, the private sector, and concerned citizens across the country. Protection also includes continuity of government and operations planning; awareness elevation and understanding of threats and vulnerabilities to their critical facilities, systems, and functions ; identification and promotion of effective sector-specific prot ection practices and methodologies ; and expansion of voluntary security-related information sharing among private entities within the sect or as well as between government and private entities.
