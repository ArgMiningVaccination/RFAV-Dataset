Good Vibrations, and Writings on the Wall: Hip-Hop in the GDR as a Case of Afro-Americanophilia Leonard Schmieding, Georgetown University As one of the last youth and pop cultures entering the world of socialis m from the West, hip-hop found holes in the Iron Curtain and, starting in 1983, began to sprea d throughout the German Democratic Republic (GDR). When, five years af ter the release of the first rap song 'Rapper's Delight' by the Sugarhill Gang in 1979, West German radio stations like Sender Freies Berlin (SFB, Radio Free B erlin), Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR2, Northern German Broadcasting), and Bayerischer Rundfunk (B R2, Bavarian Broadcasting) played rap music in their charts, they could also count on numerous East German youngsters being in their audience, given the failur e of the GDR to jam airwaves coming from the West. Tuning into the new world of sound that hip- hop created, these members of the audience were fascinated by rhythm s, mixes of old and new, and lyrics. Similarly, breakdance performances by the Roc k Steady Crew and the New York City Breakers on West German TV shows hosted by Thomas Gottschalk and Hans-Joachim Fuchsberger helped many subsequent East German b-boys pick up their first moves. The latter enthusiastically took part in the cultural transfer of rap, b- boying (also more commonly known as breakdance), deejaying, and graffiti into the GDR, creating their own world of hip-hop east of the Iron Curtain. After Harry Belafonte's movie Beat Street (1984) premiered in the GDR on 14 June 1985, only a year after its release in France, Great Britain, and West Germany, the local hip-hop Schmieding Second Culture PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 2 scene really started to flourish.1 The cultural transfer of hip -hop was enabled by diverse strands of Afro - Americanophilia. On the one ha nd, officials from the Socialist Unity Party (the SED, a.k.a. Communist Party) and the State's cultural functionaries who sought to monitor, control, and organize youth culture, expressed a certain appreciation f or African American culture. In their view, the black population in the USA in the 1980s still belonged to the oppressed and exploited working class, with whom the GDR ought to show political and cultural solidarity. The reaction of authorities t o hip -hop thus resembled earlier German leftist patter ns of perceiving African American culture. As Uta Poiger points out in her study Jazz, Rock, and Rebels , communists in Weimar Germany protested against black artists performing for bourgeois audie nces, and suggested that their performances should criticize colonial exploitation and feature rebellion instead (2002: 21). In the immediate postwar years jazz w as met with suspicion, in both West and East Germany. Under the influence of 'jazz pope' Joachim - Ernst Berendt, jazz was de -coupled in the West from its e arlier racist associations with racial degeneration, primitiveness, and feminization and became a respectable music of modernity in the 1950s (Poiger 2002: 142; Hurley 2009 ).2 In East Germany, racist connotations continued to persist, at least in relation to some jazz. The Leipzig sociologist Reginald Rudorf distinguished between commercialized forms of jazz like swing and bebop on the one hand, which he called degenerate and regarded as par t of Cold War American imperialist strategies, and 'authentic' jaz z on the other hand, like blues, spirituals, and Dixieland, which he understood as true express ions of African American folk culture, and which he deemed as conducive to stimulating the evolution of a new socialist German dance culture (Poiger 2002: 150 -53). In this vein, the cultural and political authorities made the African American singer Paul R obeson their role model for the interpretation of 'true' folklore, anti -imperialist resistance, and communism. He served as the opposite of rock 'n' roll, which, for the socialist state, held no positive value at all and was seen as the harbinger of a new world war in the 1950s (Rauhut 2011: 96 -100; Poiger 2002: 158). Although the discussion of African 1 For the influence of Beat Street on the development of hip -hop in the GDR, see Schmieding (2011; 2012 ). For a discussion of the early r eception of hip -hop culture in West Germany, see Ege and Hurley's second jointly authored survey essay in this special issue, and the scholarship they refer to. 2 This process was highly ambivalent given that Berendt appr eciated bebop and cool jazz as high culture, but looked down upon swing as working -class culture (Poiger 2002: 145). Refer also to Hurley 's paper in this special issue where he discusses Berendt's ambivalen t feelings towards 'Swingheinis.' Schmieding Second Culture PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 3 American music lost some of its fire during the reign of Erich Honecker, the advent of hip-hop revived public interest and forced the regime to react to the new est black cultural import. Somewhat removed from these public debates, East German teenagers were fascinated by the innovative, creative, and playful techniq ues they found in hip -hop culture's constituent elements of b -boying, graffiti, rap and deejaying. With these practices, they not only found new modes of expressing themselves in a way that the controll ing agencies could not decipher, but they also imagine d themselves to be in New York City, thus taking a temporary break from the constraints of the GDR. Simi lar to the authorities who sought to control them, the East German hip -hoppers' appropriation of black culture was also rooted in a distinctly German hi story of dealing with African American culture. Members of the Youth culture found allies in Afri can Americans, as Poiger has shown in her discussion of the movie Blackboard Jungle (1955) and its resonance among West German viewers. This affinity suggested that Germans could see themselves as victims \u2014of displacement, economic hardship, and the occupying forces (2002: 88). East German adolescents found traces of their African A merican allies in the blues, since this music projected 'authenticity,' promised ' pure emotion' and symbolized historical suffering: 'The blues became an escape, ideal ized as a counter - world to the GDR system of social tutelage' (Rauhut 2011: 105 -107). Analogous to the young blues fans of the previous generation, hip -hop heads make thei r escape by way of breakdance, graffiti, deejaying and rap. In order to do so, many of them 'became black,' I argue, referring t o Moritz Ege's study Schwarz Werden about Afro -Americanophilia in West Germany around 1968 (2007). I follow his definition of Afro -Americanophilia as a cultural theme: the appreciative appropriation and perception of cultural forms encoded as 'black' and the a nalogous relationship felt towards black people and/or representations of them. Becoming black, then, as a heuristic term for analysis, means an imaginary and symbolic identification with African Americans (Ege 2007: 11 -12). Consequently, my central question is: What was Afro -Americanophilia in the GDR during the 1980s? In order to answer my question, I will, in the followin g, analyze three individuals' love of African Americans and black culture: a cultural critic expl aining hip -hop for cultural functionaries; a radio host running a black music program in East B erlin; and a young Schmieding Second Culture PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 4 graffiti writer in Dresden. In all three case s I focus on the cultural work that their interpretation and/or practices of hip -hop did, and I detail how that work facilitated the emergence and development of a hip -hop scene amongst young East Germans. In the first case, I scrutinize how the cultural c ritic Erhart Ertel used Marxist -Leninist theory to perceive hip -hop as 'second culture,' and how this favorable representation paved the way for hip -hop to be embraced by socialist cultural organizations. My analysis a lso elaborates the shortcomings in thi s Marxist -Leninist interpretation, which not only excluded race as an explanatory category, but also failed to develop a s ocialist vocabulary to grapple with aspects including graffiti, rap and deejaying. T he second case study zooms in on the radio host Lutz Schramm and his program 'Vibrationen' [Vibrations] for the State -run Jugendradio DT64 [Youth Radio DT64]. By looking at both Schramm's moderation and the music he played, I analyze his ambi valent role as an actor on behalf of the State: He worked as an employee of the State -run radio in East Berlin, a socialist mass medium that intended to educate socia list youngsters and instill in them an aversion against capitalism. However, in the process, he also fed rap -hungry teenagers the American music they desi red, information about the hip -hop scene in the United States, and songs they could use in their own practice of hip -hop. Lastly, I give a case study of the graffiti 'writer,' Simo, from Dresden. This case study shows how Simo imagined himself into New Yor k, the mecca of hip -hop, how he fashioned himself as a black writer, and how he connected with the hip -hop scene all over the GDR. Hip-hop as second culture: Official perspectives on blackness in East Germany Four months after Beat Street premiered in Eas t German movie theaters in June 1985, the periodical Informationen der Generaldirektion beim Komitee f\u00fcr Unterhaltungskunst Sub -Committee for the Entertainment Arts] published an essay about hip -hop culture by the cultural cri tic Erhart Ertel, a Professor for Theater and Performance Studi es in East Berlin (Ertel 1985). Under -hop in the USA by referri ng to the Marxist -Leninist term second culture. He ended his essay by fashioning hip-hop as a desirable practice for socialism and recommending its inc orporation into the official cultural landscape of the GDR. While his perspecti ve on hip -hop expressed a general appreciation of African American culture, it, ironicall y, disregarded black cultural achievements and traditions. Instead, it focused on aspects of capitalist Schmieding Second Culture PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 5 exploitation, discrimination, and oppression \u2014thus preferring a mode of explication that was based on class and not on race and/or ethnicity. Ertel explicitly distinguished breakdance from other dance fashions such as rock 'n' roll and the twist. In fact, the term 'dance' was inaccurate, sinc e it ignored breakdance's artistic and aesthetic qua lities as well as its sociocultural meanings. He aimed to l ook behind the commodification of breakdance, and analyze its original context , shape, and function as a form of second culture: ' Er ist ein produktives Beispiel der [It is productive example of the emergence of a 'second culture' (Lenin) in l ate bourgeois society, and a specific form in the performing arts , highly attractive and socially engaging] (1985: 2).3 Whilst his contemporary audience was familiar with Lenin's concept of second culture, today's readers need an to Lenin's Kritische Bemerkungen zur nationalen Frage [Critical Remarks on the National Question ], Ertel's major theoretical reference, there are two cult ures in each nation, a hegemonic bourgeois one and a socialist -democratic one: ' [D]enn jeder Nation ' [For in every nation, there is an exploited working class, whose living conditions unavoidabl y create a democrati c and socialist ideology ] (1980: 13) . Under the ideology of the 'internationalen Kultur des Demokratismus und der Arbeiterbewegung der ganz en Welt ' [international culture of democratism and the global labor movement], second culture is the Gegengewicht zu [counter -weight bourgeois culture, and to every nation's bourgeois nationalism] (1980: 14). East German historian J\u00fcrgen Kuczynski , Ertel's second authority on the theory of culture, de velops Lenin's concept to provide a task to the ruling Socialist Unity Party: to politicize the working class on the basis of Marx's and Engels's writings and to thus form a second culture, a working class culture (1982: 242). Kuczynski sees the main diff erence between bourgeois and working -class culture \u00fcber die Natur der gesellschaftlichen Beziehungen ' [alternative ideas 3 Unless otherwise noted, all translations are mine . Schmieding Second Culture PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 6 about the nature of social relations] (1982: 228). His conception of cultu ral history intends to ' die the partial or fully extant forms of realization of these ideas in the practice of life] (1982: 282). The meaning of second culture , then, has a strong political implication: 'Die Die Arbeiterklasse ' [Second culture is the culture of the working class, it is a part of this class's struggle for power. Culture is not only a means to seize power, it i s much rather power in itself, it is the seizure of power and its maintenance. With the growth of a second culture, the power of the w orking class increases ] (1982: 229). Furthermore, Kuczynski follows a holistic approach to culture, in the Marxist sense o f appropriating the world, and he underscores the importance of differentiating between the disempowered practice of copying hegemonic culture and the empowering practice of creating working class culture. Based on these Marxist -Leninist concepts of natio n, the working class, and culture, Ertel evoked a specific image of 'America.' In his view, the working class consisted primarily of exploited and oppressed African Americans, and in New York City, of Puerto Rican immigrants too. In order to render these m inorities' everyday working - class life, he referred to Beat Street and to two travelogues, one from Denmark, the other from East Germany. The first travelogue was America] (1984). Holdt was a Danish pastor's son who had hitchhiked his w ay through the USA from 1970 to 1975 and had met the poorest of the poor in the pr ocess. He documented his encounters and experiences in letters and about 15,00 0 photographs taken during his five years on the road. In 1977 he published this collecti on in West Germany, and in 1980 the book was also became available in East Germa ny as a licensed copy. In his chapter ' Weihnachten in New York' [Christmas in New York] , Holdt included all boroughs of the city but focused on the marginalized: poor pe ople, drug addicts, and the homeless, the majority of whom were Africa n American. His photographs of heavy demolition machinery in the Bronx, poised to tear down the ruins of arson -damaged houses, of housing projects containing abominable poverty, and of Schmieding Second Culture PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 7 crack dens, demonstrated the ghetto existing in the USA's largest metropolis. Documenting how 'the other half' lived, these pictures decried capital ist America's inequality. F or the East German State and for SED officials, Holdt's book r epresented an authentic accusation against their class enemy. The fact that Holdt prefaced his book with a quote by the Cuban hero, Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, and dedicated it to 'the miracle,' Fidel Castro, m ade it all the more suitable. Hence it comes as no surprise that Ertel used Holdt to speak about t he ghetto and the ghettoization of African Americans. Aber Harlem ist nicht das einzige in Brownsville sah ich zwei Morde und h\u00f6rte am sel 5) [But Harlem is not the only ghetto in New York, and i t's by far not the worst. In the Bronx, there are areas where nine out of ten people di e an unnatural death \u2014because of hunger, an overdose of heroin, rat bites (newborns), or murder. Also, the Brooklyn ghetto is bigger than Harlem. I witnessed two murders in Brownsville and heard of four more on the same day; I haven't been there since.] This text directly follows a series of color photographs that depict ghetto graffiti, both in the Latin American mural tradition, and in the new hip -hop style (1984: 150 -160).4 Since Ertel did not tire from mentioning the ghetto, mass unemployme nt, and Afri can Americans in his account of hip -hop, it is likely that Holdt's pictures, along with his observations and judgment of the USA, were the former's major influenc e when writing about the phenomenon's emergence in New York City. Holdt's work clear ly lent it self well to Marxist -Leninist interpretations of African American culture as second c ulture. The second travelogue that Ertel used as a source was the East -German journalist of a Big City] (1983). Fischer's book has less pictures but makes up for the lack of visual information with dramatic descriptions of New Y ork's unemployment, violence and crime. Chapter headings like 'Die unregierbare ' Verbrechens ' [The World's Crime Capital] suggest a narrative of death and decay (1983: 137 -152). In particular, Fischer extensively quotes everyday voices worried about unemployed young people: Boredom is a breeding 4 The photographs document writers' 'tags' and 'pieces' on su bway carriages, and are most likely the first depictions of hip -hop graffiti available in Europe. Schmieding Second Culture PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 8 groun d for 'die Anziehungskraft der Gangs' find a home in them, to overcome ha rdship with their help, and maybe to get rich. And if not rich, then at l east famous!] (1983: 149, as cited in Ertel 1985: 5). By focusing on Fischer's point about the proble m of boredom, Ertel emphasizes the nexus between unemployment and the loss of an occupa tion, which deprives individuals of the ability to self -actualize and self -validate. The gang is one way out of this situation, another is hip -hop: Die sich hier in der and patterns of behav iour which express themselves here in a tendency towards crime are not dissimilar to those which manifest themselves elsewhere in breakdance, which comes as no surprise, because they are rooted in the same social circumstances, after all .] Ertel locates hip-hop culture in a specific image of the USA \u2014one characterized by capitalist exploitation, marginalization of African Americans, a nd mass unemployment in the metropolitan ghetto. In this context, hip -hop, as an interplay of breakdance, graffiti and rap, is second culture that emerges from the living conditions of young African Americans and Puerto Ricans in New York City (Ertel 1985: 4). Explaining hip -hop as second culture foregrounds economic aspects, and therefore the terms labor and production are c entral to Ertel's analysis. He looks first at breakdance and then at graffiti and rap. According to his analysis, unemployment and exclusion from production \u2014both high in the non -white population \u2014have two effects. First, traditional modes of self -actualizat ion are not possible and trigger the search for new ones. Second, the structural difference between work and leisure col lapses, which has an impact on how people view, perceive, and receive art. In capitalist society, Ertel argues, over -consumption can num b people and thus render them incapable of engaging with art. I n breakdance, however, African American teenagers have overcome the danger by attaining a new mode of self -actualization, one that protests against social conditions in a practical way. Ertel c oncludes: ' erf\u00e4hrt ' [The anti tendency of such a movement can be clearly identif ied in this approach, just as it is confirmed in the Schmieding Second Culture PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 9 concrete practice of breakdance] (1985: 4) . In other words, hip -hop is not only the culture of the working class, but as second culture it actively joins the class struggle. This function can also be ob served in graffiti, as Ertel continues: ' In \u00e4hnlicher Weise ist [sic] ' [In the field of visual arts, the graffiti movement has to be understood in s imilar terms. It is not by coincidence that it gained a similarly high level importance in t he South Bronx, and that it is sometimes p racticed by artists who are simultaneously b -boys] (1985: 6) . As political and social messages, graffiti deconstruct hegemonic str ategies and occupy the public urban space. Graffiti 'pieces' on subway trains have even becom e moving art exhibitions, challen ging traditional systems of communication. Like breakdance, then, graffiti is ' kultureller Widerstand und Ausdruck eigenen Lebenswillens ' [cultural resistance and an expression of the will to live one's own life] (1985: 7). The general absence of Marxist -Leninist vocabulary in this interpretation of graffiti is conspicuous, however. It anticipates the official helplessness the State fa ced when trying to come to terms with graffiti in East Germany. Not only were the individual symbols difficult to decode, bu t it proved impossible to translate graffiti's social and cultural functions into socialism. But then how could one find a place for practices that occupied public space and deconstructed hegemonic discourse within a political system that r elied on control ling the public and did everything to guard its ruling discourse. The role of public space is central to rap as well, Ertel e xplains. Young African American rappers' lyrics refer to their experiences in the me tropolis. As with breakdance, rappers play wit h their reality so as to alter and deconstruct it: F\u00fcr Rap 8) [In rap and in breakdance, it is striking how [the artists] use the constituents of their metropolitan culture so rigorously and creatively, a cultur e which they know primarily through the media ... This active use of cultural constituents is to be understood in terms of [the rappers expressing] sovereignty, deconstruction, and re -ascribing meaning. Here, we find active protest against a culture, which already through its inescapable presen ce has a raping effect. This raping and thus dominating situation is reversed in rap.] Schmieding Second Culture PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 10 Ertel thereby identifies the potential for protest in rap. As wi th graffiti , however, he does not use Marxist -Leninist vocabulary to interpret the cultural function of rap. It is telling that in his elaborations about hip -hop in the GDR he only engages with breakdance and its possible functions in socialist terms. Moreover, i t is astonishing that the development of hip -hop in East Germany actually came to mirror his discourse. That is, while cultural functionaries successfully disciplined, controlle d, and instrumentalized breakdance, which Ertel analyzed for them in Marxist -Lenini st terms, they were unable to grasp graffiti, deejaying and rap, for which he had no vocabulary. In his commentary on hip -hop Ertel predicts that breakdance lacks the potential to grow into a mass movement in the GDR. Pointing to Beat Street 's appeal to a teenage audience, he states: ' Auch die in our film programs of ... Harry Belafonte' s movie 'Beat Street' will not trigger its practical emulation, although it will invigorate the enthusiasm for breakdance] (Ertel 1985: 9). He appreciates that breakdance might be appro priated in the GDR because hip -hop, as second culture, is working -class culture, and he even argues that interested teenagers should be supported in their endeavours, since breakdancing is to be preferred to more passive cultural acti vities (1985: 9). (Eve n in the socialist cultural landscape, he admits, most forms of le isure rely on passive reception, and thus fall into the spurned category of consumption.) Overal l, breakdance has an activating character, and it should therefore be supported. In order to corroborate his argument, Ertel analyzes how breakdance changes its s ocial function within the process of cultural transfer: course, will only fully emerge and realis e the social functions mentioned above in its original societal circumstances ... In socialism, breakdanc e is ultimately only partially seized upon, rather than in its full comple xity. Naturally, the process of appropriation occurs s poradically rather than on the basis of conceptualized reflection. And this sporadic development is Schmieding Second Culture PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 11 unproblematic precisely because it is imprinted by the operation of a l ife context that is tailored to a socialist society.] (1985: 9) With the absence of unemployment in socialism, other realities wi ll inform breakdance. The essential difference between breakdance in capitalism and bre akdance in socialism, according to Ertel, is the following: In the f ormer, breakdance is the only form of self - actualization available, whereas in the latter, it is just one of many such forms from which to choose, which, in turn, have positive repercussions for social ism (1985: 9f). The way Ertel fashioned breakdance as a desirable cultural practice paved the way for its swift incorporation into the cultural mainstream of State socialism. Dutifully following Marxist -Leninist ideology, he focused on the capitalist mechanisms of economic exploitation in the USA, regardless of race. In the process, he ignored the rich cultural heritage of African American practices dealing with the experience of racist discrimination. Hip -hop, as a derivative of blues and jazz, was thus severed from African American cultural production. In hi s attempts to decode the semiotics of hip - hop culture, Ertel inscribed new meanings on it by prioritizing economic explanations over aspects of race or ethnicity.5 Whilst his interpretation may have been partly enabled by the polysemiology of contemporary (black) popular culture, his reading of hip-hop owed much to the rigid ideology of Marxism -Leninism, which ignored race and racism as analytic categories. It thus ultimately illustra ted another German uncertainty about just how to respond to African Americ an cultural products. Hence, 'areas of uncertainty,' which Kusmierz has diagnosed within the West German r eception of Spike Lee movies and hip -hop culture, also characterized official GDR attitudes \u2014the State's Afro -Americanophilia \u2014towards hip -hop, albeit ways (2002: 168). Good vibrations: Lutz Schramm's black music radio on DT64 The Jugendradio DT64 program 'Vibrationen' [Vibrations] contributed heavily to spreading hip -hop across East Germany. Hosted by Lutz Schramm, it ran as a ' black music' broadcast and featured rock steady, ska, and African music in additi on to hip - hop. On its first program on 13 January 1988, there were eleven rap songs, ten of which 5 It is important to note that inscribing new contents into existing texts is usually the strat egy of practitioners involved in the transfer of a cultural practice. For the West German case of hip -hop, see Ribbat (2000) and Kusmierz (2002). Cultural scholars in the GDR, however, applied this strategy deliberately, serving the aims and ends of the di ctatorship: contributing to a hegemonic discourse in order to maintain cultural and political authority. Consequently, thi s difference between East and West calls for an awareness concerning the use of Cultural Studies ' terminology \u2014key terms like power, pl easure, and freedom are imbued with different meanings, which have to be historicized. Schmieding Second Culture PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 12 were from the USA, and one from the GDR (Schramm 1988b).6 Schramm maintained this ratio b etween dominant American hip -hop and East German productions until the program was terminated in September 1991. Lutz Schramm acted on behalf of the State. He nevertheless helpe d the evolving East German hip -hop scene to tune in to the transnational commu nity of hip -hop. As he had done with other musical subcultures in earlier programs, he functioned here as a 'trailblazer of the underground' (Rauhut 2002). By playing US rap tunes and talking about the performers, he mediated hip -hop knowledge to his liste ners, and in the process they became a participating audience (Schmieding 2012). As a radio host, he delivered aural versions of 'America' to his audience, and then contextualized these sounds by reference to an interpretation of hip -hop culture.7 The fact that hip -hop was officially understood as a form of second culture and hence mandated an expression of sol idarity with its anti -capitalist American practitioners certainly made it easier for Schramm to create his program. But his role was that of a 'trick ster' (Hyde 1998). For the cultural functionaries' ears he communicated perspectives on hip -hop that were officially accepted, and even called for. For his young audience, however, he played the music they appreciated, which he could do precisely because h e accompanied his musical selections with ostensibly 'socialist' interpretations. In additi on, Schramm functioned as a relay for information regarding the activities of the local s cene. He announced events, interviewed artists and presented their productio ns, sometimes even as live -recordings from recent concerts. 6 The US tracks included, for example, 'Funk Jam Party' by Africa and 'He's DJ, I'm the Rapper' by DJ Jazzy Jeff . 7 'Vibration en' was neither the first nor the only program Lutz Schramm hosted on DT64 . By this time he he had won the trust of his superiors such that he had carved out a re latively free space in which to create his shows. Concerning censorship, he stated in 1987: Ich spiele das, was ich verantworten kann. Das meint was meinen als an den inhaltlichen. (cited in Larkey 2007: 1 74) [I play whatever I can account for. That is, what I can t ake the responsibility for vis -\u00e0-vis my bosses and what I can live with myself. I have a certain political at titude and set limits for myself , and I have to constantly be aware of the fact that this is radio in the GDR , a medium with a certain political program. But I also play songs which are ... extreme, musically speaking. If a song cannot be played, it's usually because of our technical limit s, not because of explicit content]. (my translation) Schmieding Second Culture PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 13 The conditio sine qua non for Lutz Schramm's multifaceted role was that, as a black music special, ' Vibrationen ' belonged to DT64 's innovations in the 1980s, which meant that he had substantial fr eedom with his programming. In the following discussion, I provide an overview of the program's history up to the end of 1989 and then f ocus on one specific broadcast from 21 September 1988, in which he presented Public Enemy 's current release, the LP It takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (Schramm 1988c). 'Vibrationen ,' which as we have seen was devoted to 'black music' more broadl y, had run 78 episodes by the end of 1989. Schramm curated about a third of them, 22 episodes in all, as special hip -hop programs, playing (mainly US) rap, as well as reporting on the local scene, and interviewing East German hip -hop artists. The format proved so successful in its first year that at the beginning of 1989, Schramm was permitted to broadcast ' Vibrationen ' every Thursday, rather than twice a month. One program per month would now be devoted to hip -hop. 'Vibrationen ' had a dual impact. First, Party and State officials adjudged whether the program fulfilled its educational purpose, but as they could only do so on the basis of easily accessible information, they probably only took Schramm's spoken m oderation into account, and did not inquire independently into the English -language lyrics of the US tracks. Schramm made this task easy for them in the sense that his moderation paraphrased the lyrics, thus providing a kind of translation, and that he glossed the US artists' understanding of rap and hip -hop culture. He presented their productions as a protest against capitalism, consumer culture, and racism in the USA.8 His interpretation thereby fashioned hip -hop as second culture in the sense that Erhard Ertel analyzed it, and therefore would have been appreciated by the cultural functionaries controlling the program. Thus mediated, the music itself, which made up for most of the show, could sound inconspicuous and harmless, regardless of what the sometimes incompr ehensible English lyrics might be saying.9 Schramm's young audience tuned into his program precisely because it could hear US hip-hop on it. As a soundtrack for b -boy routines or as raw material for deejays and 8 Schramm thus continued the state radio's tradition of featuring African American artists for their criticism of capitalism, voices against racist oppression, an d authenticity (Larkey 2007: 126). 9 Edw ard Larkey points out that lyrics might not have been as i mportant as they might have been, given that they no longer were subject to political assessment (ce nsorship) and teenage listeners cared more about the sound than the text (2007: 173). Schmieding Second Culture PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 14 rappers to use in their mixes and rhymes, ' Vibrationen ' offered an up -to-date repository of sounds and texts with which to practice hip -hop. Recorded off the air onto tape and suitably edited, they wer e soon ready to be played loudly on the hip -hoppers' boom boxes, as they rambled through the cities of East Germany.10 As b -boy Salli of the dem Potenzial, f\u00fcr k then it (Vibrationen) was the program with the most potential, for us as da ncers it was the program to get music] (Salewski 201 2b). Testifying to the intensity with which they followed the program, he adds: Also bei mir war es ja so, das das Tanzen wichtiger wa r, als die Rapper, die ich sovi el man ja an den einzelner \"Vibrationen\" so dancing was more important than the rappers who contributed the music. Of course, music of good quality was always welcome, so we also listened to several radio programs in the GDR. When feasible, we sat in front of the radio or set a self-made clock timer to record the program so that we would neither miss the program nor practice or p erformance. The next day, we cut the recordi ng to the music we needed. For our rappers \u2014you can see that in the commentaries \u2014 'Vibrationen' was the NONPLUSULTRA. They were really int o this music scene and knew the material much better than we dancers, and they used t hese programs regularly.] Ironica lly, once Schramm's moderation was edited from the music, his show s were now impossible to distinguish from the sounds emanating from the radio stations of the 'class enemy' in West Germany and Western Europe more broadly. In addition to this vital supply of musical material, Schramm's young audience learned about the newe st developments of hip -hop culture in the USA, since Schramm's presentations went beyond socialist readings of individual songs to also narrate hip -hop history and explain special techniqu es like rapping and deejaying, thus meeting written requests from his listeners (Schramm 1988a). In sum, then, ' Vibrationen ' transported sounds, knowledge, and ideas about hip -hop through the Iron Curtain. In the process, it accommodated the 10 This appro priation of 'Vibrationen' seems to have been standard practice among hip-hop heads, as it figures prominently in the personal interviews I conducte d with former b -boys, deejays, and rappers (see, for example, DJ Opossum 2005; DJ Gambler 2008; TJ Big Blaste r Electric Boogie, Andy K, Tommy, 2008). Schmieding Second Culture PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 15 different ma nifestations of Afro -Americanophilia held by both the official State audience and the grass roots scene. The episode broadcast on 21 September 1988 illustrates how the ambiguitie s of 'Vibrationen ' played out. In this episode Schramm reviewed Public Enemy' s second record, It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back , which had been released on 14 April, 'mit einem ganz speziellen Hip -hop program] (Schramm 1988c). He interpreted the track, 'Don't Believe the Hype,' as a charge not to believe the record industry's promises, and this motif served as a cue for his ensuing characterization of the group: Die Aufforderung, sich nicht gutgl\u00e4ubig dem preiszuge ben, was Radio und Musikpresse (und nicht nur die) so in h\u00f6ren. F\u00fcr bei de hat es vor 4 Jahren i n einer New Yorker College -Station begonnen, wo sie die to not naively believe what radio, music journalism, and other media are stuffing into their young consumers' heads is very seldom heard from a pop band. Chuck D. and Flavor Flav of Public Enemy preach this whiteness [sic; this could also mean Weisheit , that is, wisdom] not only as musicians but also as former radio DJs. Both started their careers 4 yea rs ago at a college station in New York, where they used their nine hours of hip -hop airplay per weekend to also communicate their political views to the audience.] To the ears of socialist functi onaries, commending politically active musicians for criticizing capitalist consumer culture must have sounded like second c ulture. Teenagers, however, had just enjoyed listening to 'Don't believe the Hype' and wer e not necessarily susceptible to official political indoctrination via hip -hop. If they had been, the message they heard might also have been not to listen to the ideologi cally charged 'hype' of the socialist mass media! Notwithstanding that ambiguity, the young hip -hop heads were probably more in terested in the second part of the announcement, anyway. Here they were informed that the two rappers had worked as deeja ys and could spin records for an enviable nine hours per weekend. Compared to the one hour of 'Vibrationen ' per month, which came with a lot of commentary that they were not necessarily interested in, such a story fed into their fantasy im age of New York City as a hip-hop paradise. Another of Schramm's announcements described Public Enemy 's political beliefs, class struggle, their anti -racism, and sounds as something like second culture. It may well Schmieding Second Culture PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 16 have been more accommodating to the authorities, again, than to his young audience: Als gutgl\u00e4ubige Moslems und Bef\u00fcrworter der Black Panther -Bewegung sehen sie die Situation der Farbigen in ihren Statements anprangern...] Das Ziel von Public die Lauter als Bomben! ' (Schramm 1988c)11 [As followers of Islam and advocates of the Black Panthe r movement, they don't regard the situation of colored people in the USA as settled. I n their statements, Public Enemy dec ry the State's ignorance and patent racism ... It is Public En emy's goal to get their listeners to understand these problems. And they do that with their raps ... Louder than bombs!] As legitimate as it was to foreground ideology when talking about such a politically active group as Public Enemy , this kind of representation seems politically overcharged at the expense of adequate commentary on their musical achievements. Schramm concluded his review of It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back with only a few remarks on their practice of rapping and deejaying, too few given that his teenage audience was more interested in the music than in ideology: Musikalisch sind Chuck D , Flavor X immer noch D, Flavor Flav, and their D J, Terminator X, still offer the toughest that hi p-hop currently has to offer. Their arrangements are partly, and quite minimally, based on Chuck D's thundering beat box and his heavy voice. F lavor Flav loosens up everything with his almost boyish sounding voice. And very rarely, Terminator X allows hims elf to perform some swinging interludes. The James -Brown scratches and other trendy gimmicks that you h ear elsewhere are taboo.] Although Lutz Schramm was not quite correct with his last statem ent\u2014most pieces on the album indeed feature James Brown sampl es\u2014this non -political part of the review was what the teenagers were looking for when they tuned into his show. I n these smaller interludes, they could appreciate both the music and the moderation, since the ideological context was missing. In comparison w ith the cultural functionaries, who were at a loss with the music, the hip -hop heads emerged as the winners. By appropriating ' Vibrationen ,' they turned a program that was designed to control them and their culture into something that was useful for their everyday practice of hip -hop. And ironically Schramm, the State's representative, thereby did m ore to foster the hip - hop scene's creativity, than he did to guide it in 'appropriate' ways . His continuous 11 'Louder than a Bomb' was the next track Schramm played. Schmieding Second Culture PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 17 eagerness to feature rap made in the GDR, for example , from SBJ in Arnstadt, the Electric Beat Crew in Berlin, or TJ Big Blaster Electr ic Boogie in Dresden, and to otherwise report on local hip -hop events functioned as great incentives for hip -hop heads in East Germany to remain active in the scene (Schramm n.d.; Schramm 1989). He nourished audiences' love for African American culture, and the ide as, information, and sounds he gave to the teenage audience proved to be vital for the hip -hop scene. On the other hand, packaging American rap as second culture see med to be primarily about keeping politicians, functionaries, and other socialist officials ca lm about hip -hop culture. Performing blackness in graffiti: Simo from Dresden East German graffiti 'writers' not only expressed themselves vis ually; they also imagined themselves to be taking part in the transatlantic culture of hip-hop. They thus committed a temporary Republikflucht , a short break -out from a socialism they thought constrained them like a ghetto. But if they had to live in a ghetto, one could say that they preferred the Bronx to the GDR (DJ Opossum 2005). Consequently, thes e writers fashioned themselves as black teenagers roaming the Bronx. Their Afro - Americanophilia not only helped them to transcend the otherwise tightly s ealed border to the west, it also led them, subconsciously, to take on a black identity. That is to say, they appropriated a black writer's identity, albeit without acknowledgi ng the economic hardships, racial discrimination and gang violence that African Amer ican and Puerto Rican teenagers had to face on a daily basis in the Bronx in the 1980s. In thi s section I focus on the writer Simo from Dresden and show how he fashioned himself as a black graffiti artist from the Bronx in New York City. He is repres entative of many writers and b-boys in the GDR.12 Kai Simon from Dresden came to graffiti by way of breakdance (S imon 2008). Like others in his generation, he came into contact with hip -hop as a teenager (at age 14) after watching Beat Street in the summer of 1985. He soon concentra ted on painting graffiti. Taking his cue from Ramo, the graffiti -writer in Beat Street whose original name was Ramon, he dropped the final -n of his name and became Simo. Initially, he 12 The documentary movie Here We Come , directed by Nico Raschick (2006), and its bonus material (on DVD), illustrate in great detail the visual practices of graffiti in the GDR, showing that the hip -hop heads used black motives in their graffiti and fashion (see the examples of Grandmaster Fight Machine, Beat Smith and Syntonic Force). See also Schmieding (2008b). Schmieding Second Culture PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 18 mimetically copied what he saw in Beat Street , trying to be as precise as possible. Only later, starting in 1988, when he participated in local contests a nd workshops organized by the deejay and rapper TJ Big Blaster Electric Boogie, and began to build a network within the hip -hop scene, did he begin to create his own graffit i. It was then that he realized: 'That's me now \u2014I'm a real artist' (Simon 2008). The exchange with other graffiti artists and the respect he gained in the process gave him the confidence to try out different styles and become an accomplished writer. None of Simo's original graffiti 'pieces' in Dresden's public spaces has survived the last 25 years. Neither are there any photographs that could serve as documentation of his ephemeral art. Consequently, the only visual source testifying to his practice as a writer is his sketchbook, the so -called 'black book.' In it he drew studies and preliminary versions of the graffiti he intended to create. The book a llows us to see how he conceptualized his art, the people he regarded as his greatest inf luences, and how h e came of age as a graffiti writer in Dresden between 1986 and 1989. On his black book covers (see figure 1), Simo visually represents his story of becoming a writer in the GDR. On the front, he copies the famous tag 'Wi ld Style' from the film of the same name and adds the well -known quotation 'It's about time we start gettin' some publicity for this rap shit' (Simon 1986b). He thereby offers a m otto for his work \u2014attracting the public's attention to hip -hop\u2014but he also demonstrates that, at this early stag e of his career, he is limited to copying his idols. In contrast , the back cover reveals a mature writer full of self -esteem and a clear sense of belonging: 'Power from the East Side' (Simon 1990a). With this tag, Simo locates hims elf in East Germany. The graffiti in the black book bespeak his iconographic negotiation with the U SA. They depict how he conceives of himself as a 'subway writer,' paying respe ct to hip -hop's pioneers in New York City, the cradle and capital of hip -hop (Simon 1986a; Simon 1987b) . He lists famous rappers deejays \u2014Cool DJ Herc, Grandmaster Mel, and Afrika Bambaataa, all of whom starred in Beat Street (see figure 2) \u2014and refers to all the hip -hop locations in town, also representing New York City's skyline, the Statue of Liberty a nd 'NY.'13 He thus makes New York his own, inscribing its hip -hop culture 13 While listing the boroughs of New York, he m akes the mistake of omitting Staten Island and includes Harlem instead, thus increasing the black space of t he city that he references throughout his narrative (see figure 2). Schmieding Second Culture PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 19 into his persona as a writer. What is more, he pictures himse lf as a black writer spray - painting with a personalized spray can, channeling his frustration into art in the Bronx (see f igures 3 and 4; Simon 1987a; Simon 1988).

Simo's mind was in an imaginary Bronx and his body in the local hip -hop scene in Dresden, a pattern he shared with hip -hop heads all over the GDR. He received his Schmieding Second Culture PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 21 'Power from the East Side' by being part of an Afro -Americanophile audience participat ing in the transnational culture of hip -hop; an audience capable of transcending the Iron Curtain by practicing breakdance, graffiti, dee jaying and rap in East Germany. Due to Simo's reputation, local hip -hop artists commissioned him to create graffiti for their own use. B -Boys asked him to design so -called 'backpieces' for their jackets and hoodies, to look 'fly' in the club and on the stre ets (Simon 2008). Rappers and deejays wanted his graffiti for the covers of their home made musical productions and sta ge designs, or in order to advertise themselves. The following exchange between the music group A.B.R. and Simo's crew Drizzly For ce exemplifies how [Hello Drizzly Force! This is the A.B.R. music project. Thanks for being willing to \"whip up\" your graffiti for us. We'll also be in Radebeul [for the rap contest], and we should meet there sometime ... Concerning the graffiti, please feel free to be \"as c reative as you want.\" I suggest you come up with some sketches, and when we meet we decide toget her which is the best. OK? We'll vote for your graffiti during the contest in Radebeul , and we want to dis play them on all of our gigs ... \" Radebeul Veterans\" are the real stuff!!] This passage also shows how important self -organized hip -hop events like the one in Radebeul were. They were beyond the control of the cultural authorities and were important site s for exchanging materials, ideas, and practices among the hip -hop audience in the GDR. The rap workshop in Radebeul in January 1989, organized as part of the Univer sal Hip Hop Family by the rapper TJ Big Blaster Electric Boogie from Dr esden, was especial ly important for building the hip -hop scene in the GDR. It was also an important site for steering Afro -Americanophilia. TJ Big Blaster Electric Boogie carefully orc hestrated young hip -hoppers imaginary and symbolic interaction with blackness by stressing in his rules and regulations that he wanted the participants to write o riginal lyrics, and not just copy their African American idols (Figas 1989). In a letter of advice to his fellow rapper SBJ, he wrote: allgemein, was Du Second Culture PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 22 nichts ist schlimmer als Blaster Electric Boogie 1989) [Concerning your plans with writing texts, I stro ngly advise against using clich\u00e9s and thus taking the easy way out. Nothing is worse than stealing other peopl e's text lines. It is better to make grammatical mistakes, better to have an only limited expressi on, as long as you have texts that you wrote you rself. If you want to learn English, translate lyrics \u2014sometimes they're printed on the album covers, or try to transcribe them (sic).] TJ Big Blaster Electric Boogie's insistence on originality rea ds like a plea for 'authenticity,' which, as Gabriele Kle in and Malte Friedrich have argued, is the most important aesthetic value in hip -hop culture. Here, authenticity is to be achieved by appropriating hip -hop in the space between its 'original' from the Bronx and its 'original' on the performer's home turf, that is his or her local political, social, and cultural environment (Klein & Friedrich 2003: 8 -11). By composing lyrics, music, and graffiti which were largely inspired by hip -hop culture seen in Beat Street , hip-hop heads like SBJ, TJ Big Blaster Electri c Boogie, and Simo were quite aware that they did not in fact live in the Bronx. However, they wanted to be as authentic as their idols, and in doing so they expressed a desire to escape the GDR in an imaginary manner. If Simo earned respect within the hi p-hop scene, he also met incomprehension by the police. Years after the fall of the Wall, in a questionnaire for a hip -hop magazine, he recounted an incident in Dresden, close to the youth club ' Scheune ' [The Barn], which hosted the most famous hip -hop par ties in town: Eine kletterte Lee auf die Schultern of three wannabe \"sprayers\" had miraculously got ten their hands on some spray cans from Czechoslovakia. Finally, the night is dark, the s treets are empty, and we three are in happy anticipation of waking up the next morning as real WRITERS. Everything is planned out. Unfortunately, the cans only allow for one piece, bu t it doesn't matter, everybody can spray on his own. We brought chalk so as not to waste our precious paint on the firs tlines. We're on the wall, at night, with s pray cans, what a feeling ... What can possibly stop us? We have all seen Beat Street Schmieding Second Culture PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 23 over and over, and have watched Lee standing on the shoulders of another wr iter in order to reach up high. So standing on shoulders, with a feeling of freedom, we're draw ing the first lines with chalk. Then, out of nothing, a [police] TRABI [car] appears and comes to a halt a certain distance away ... Back at the station, which was just around the co rner, by the way, they gazed at us as if we were Moors at a circus circa 1 912. Every police officer stopped working just to stare at us. We were scared as hell. Eventually, though, we only had to state what and why we had wanted to paint. They even let us keep the cans. Full of adrenaline, we went tagging all over the city that night.] Whilst this episode reveals how rarely young East German writers had the opportunity to use real spray cans, and how they went to great lengths to obtain them from a neighboring socialist country, it also discloses how incapable of decipheri ng hi p-hop the police authorities in East Germany sometimes were. The police a nd the members of the Ministry for State Security (Stasi, or secret police) often used harsh measures against what they called 'defiling public property.'14 In this case, however, Simo and his friends were lucky that the local officers were unable to comprehend the gra ffiti and dealt with them leniently. Conclusion In this article, I have analyzed an instance of East German Afr o-Americanophilia by looking at the cultural transfer of hi p-hop in the mid -to-late 1980s. I focused on three individuals who participated in this process at different levels. Cultural critic Erhart Ertel interpreted hip -hop as second culture and recommended it to be appropriated by youngsters in East Germany, thu s paving the way for its incorporation into the socialist cultural landscape. Radio host Lutz Schramm played a more ambiguous r ole, on the one hand satisfying the authorities' demands to use the mass media for socialist education, and on the other hand fee ding his teenage hip -hop audience the information and music necessary to create a hip -hop scene of their own. Graffiti writer Simo imagined himself to be living in the mecca of hip -hop, the Bronx, and he did so by fashioning himself as black in his graffit i. In the last years of the GDR hip -hop-based Afro -Americanophilia maintained some characteristic patterns of engaging with blackness in East Germany. State -sponsored Afro -Americanophilia lauded hip -hop as second culture on the basis of its fight against capitalism and its authentic expression of a tough black life in the metropolis. On the other hand, hip -hop heads allied themselves imaginatively with their black idols, joi ning them in a struggle to break out of a ghetto communing between the GDR and the USA. 14 For a case of the Ministry of State Security dealing with hip -hop graffiti, se e Schmieding (2011). Schmieding Second Culture PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 24 Similar ways of appropriating African American culture can be found i n the immediate postwar era, and East Germany during the 1960s. Whether they dealt wi th jazz, rock 'n' roll, blues, or hip -hop\u2014neither state nor teenagers changed distinctively in th eir Afro - Americanophilia. Reference List A. B.

PORTAL is published under the auspices of UTSePress, Sydney, Austra Journey from Jazz to Weltmusik Andrew Wright Hurley, University of Technology Sydney Berendt and the battle to legitimate jazz The S\u00fcdwestfunk (South-Western Radio, SWF) broadcaster, author and produce r Joachim-Ernst Berendt stands tall in Germany's postwar musico- political landscape.1 A tireless promoter of jazz (and of himself), he emerged in the e arly 1950s\u2014particularly in the wake of his bestselling Das Jazzbuch [The Jazz Book] (1953a)\u2014as Germany's most prominent mediator and interpreter of the music. He held this role from the 1950s until well into the 1970s and participated in several successive Ge rman debates about jazz, and later Weltmusik and New Age Music.2 He also engaged with a variety of critics, including Theodor Adorno and the younger members of the '1968' genera tion, precisely over the meaning of these musics. One should perhaps be wary of overstating the reach or uptake of Berendt's ideas, which for the most part cir culated through the somewhat arcane world of the German-speaking jazz scene which, eve n at its height in the mid-late 1950s, probably only accounted for some 10 percent of young people (Kater 2006). Nevertheless, Berendt was an influential figure who published widely, not only within the jazz scene, but also in a range of non-jazz media, and who was always 1 For a full account of Be rendt's life and work, from which the following biog raphical sketch is largely derived, see Hurley (2009b). 2 I resist translating the term Weltmusik (literally 'world music'), because it had a series of conn otations and a (German) history pre -dating the r ise of 'world music' as a marketing category in English -speaking world in the 1980s and 1990s. Hurley How 'Afro -Americanophilia' Became Polyphilia PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 2 keen to reach demographics outside the jazz scene. Beginning in the 1960s, he toyed with pop music, and via his involvement in the influential lifestyl e magazine, twen , he acted as a tastemaker in relation to a range of different sort s of music. He also never shied away from commenting on broader matters than jazz. For insta nce, he was a watchful observer of racial discrimination and the African Americ an civil rights movement in the USA, publishing on the subject in a number of important public ations including Merkur Zeitung [Frankfurt General News paper] One of the benefits of looking at Berendt's career is that he repre sents a diachronic case that straddles many of the different phases of Afro -Americanophilia discussed by Moritz Ege and me in our two jointly authored survey essays in this s pecial issue. Born during the Weimar Republic, Berendt came of age during the National Soc ialist era, and emerged as a public intellectual in the postwar era. Although he was attacked in the counterculture period, he was a survivor and continued to be active into the 1990s. Focusing on Berendt can reveal a lot about the ways in which race could be and was discussed in postwar Germany, despite the ostensible taboo; that focus also contributes to the growing body of literature on Black presences and Afro -Americanoph ile practices in Germany that we discuss in our joint essays. In particular, Be rendt emerges as a case study for determining the extent of continuities in race talk between the postwar era and earlier eras, including the Colonial era, as well as the Wei mar and National Socialist eras. A number of scholars \u2014from Uli Linke (1999) to Heide Fehrenbach (2007) and Sabine Broeck (2011) \u2014have discussed the continuities in this setting, and suggested that underlying ways of viewing race were often maintained, in spite of the ideology of a new start. Katrin Sieg (2009) has pointed to the ways in which post war talking about Others, like Amerindians in the context of Karl May festivals, c ould also be a way of engaging in a type of surrogate talk about Jews, and establishi ng the speaker as a 'good German.' In a similar way, raced talk about jazz and Weltmusik , and expressing one's love for those musics \u2014Afro -Americanophilia and what in this essay I call polyphilia \u2014 could also be a surrogate way of expressing something like ph ilosemitism after the War. Philosemitism is a well -known phenomenon in its own right (Stern 1992), but the way that something related to it could manifest itself in Afro -Americanophilia or polyphilia is less well known ( 156; Hurley 2008) . Finally, looking at Berendt's discussion of these art forms can tell us a little about the pr ivileges of German whiteness Hurley How 'Afro -Americanophilia' Became Polyphilia PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 3 in the postwar era. Berendt had a long career in which he was f ree to chop and change in the way he discussed jazz and Weltmusik . Alth ough he invested a great deal of intellectual and emotional labour in conceiving of, promoting and discussi ng those musics, and he felt some external imperatives to change, his posit ion was not seriously under fire, especially from racial others in Germany . His career as a jazz and Weltmusik producer and writer was not subjected to scrutiny, particularly in li ght of that change in what Stuart Hall (2013) calls the 'relationships of representati on' that arose with the emergence of Afro -German activism and sc holarship in the 1980s, and which Moritz and I discuss in our second joint essay in this special issue. The ext ent to which the African -American and 'world' musicians whom Berendt assisted over his care er were able to exercise their subjecthood, whilst imp ortant, is not the subject of this article. Jazz was never something that was just 'musical' for Berendt. I n this respect, he was very much a product of his times. Born in 1922, Berendt was raised a t time when to a large extent music and politics were con flated (on this aspect, see Weiner 1993; Applegate & Potter 2002). This was especially the case in relati on to jazz. Conservative Weimar -era anti -jazz discourse often focused on the idea of jazz's links with deca dence, with 'inner (Adolf Halfeld, quoted in Poiger 2000: 19). Race also figured strongly in the conservative discussions of jazz, a nd this aspect was partly informed by long -standing colonial era racial ideology in Germany, as well as by more general anxieties including o nes borne of the occupation of the Rheinland by Black francophone jazz stood as a sign for the 'black,' in the s ense of an 'Other' to the embattled German/Europ ean (see Weiner 1991: 478). Nazi anti -jazz debates continued to focus on race, but moved beyond these earlier conservat ive tropes by advancing, inter alia , the notion of a Jewish led conspiracy to undermine the racial health of the German Volk [people] by co-opting the dangerous sensuality of black jazz to seduce German women. Jazz was not simply jazz, it was 'Ni gger-Jew-Jazz' (Jost 1997: 362; Kater 1992: 32). This historical element was important in te rms of the postwar quasi -philosemitic hue of some jazz talk. In the opinion of some ideologues, jazz was not only a sign for the 'black,' but also for the racial miscegenation which offended the Nazi idea of 'pure' racial (and cultural) essences, and which the Nazi 3 On the longer traditions of German racial ideology, see Mo ritz Ege's and my first jointly authored survey essay in this issue . Hurley How 'Afro -Americanophilia' Became Polyphilia PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 4 regime sought to outlaw under the Nuremberg L aws (Kater 1992: 33). Jazz was 'musical race defilement.' One Nazi ideologue, Richard Litters cheid, noted in 1936, for example: 'Erst Hoffmann 99). [It was only after the 'white' Am erican bands picked up the stimulus of Nigger -Jazz, that the actual Anglo -American hybrid product of jazz came into being.] On the other hand, whilst some German leftists were in favour of jazz as a way of pepping up stale modes of classical music ( Kater 1992: 16 -17), others, like Adorno, also worried about the ability of jazz to 'diss ipate [the proletariat's] revolutionary potential' (Poiger 2000: 21). The postwar setting changed some, but not all, of the ideological weighting of jazz. Although there was again a spectrum of different attitudes to jazz, positive and negative, these tended to be reduced in debates to the binary of Jazzfreund [friend of jazz ] and Jazzgegner [opponent of jazz], and the Jazzgegner were perceived as being significantly in the majority (see e.g. Berendt 1950).4 Jazzgegner held widely differing perspectives from Adorno's \u2014he re -stated his critique in 1953 \u2014and ranged from the conser vative and the ex -National Socialist. In some cases there was a continuity of sor ts between the conservative and the ex -National Socialist. For example, the conservative music pedagogue Wilhelm Twittenhoff published an early post -war study of jazz, Jugend und Jazz [Young People and Jazz] (1953), which sought to inform music teachers about jazz, so that they could steer their young charges into an appreciation of more wholesome types of music. Twittenhoff had been a National Socialist \u2014which is not to say tha t his post-war interventions replicated the anti -jazz arguments of Nazi -era ideologues. In any event, in a context where other 'carry -overs' existed \u2014for example, popular anti - Semitism continued in West Germany well into the 1950s (Stern 1992; H\u00f6hn 2002: 221)\u2014some Jazzfreunde felt there to be an ideological inheritance from the days of National Socialist indoctrination against jazz. This carry -over was genuinely troubling, but, perversely, it also represented an opportunity of sorts. On the one hand, it sugg ested that the Germans might not have learned their lessons, and that the vi rus of fascism might re -emerge. On the other hand, it made jazz a potent musico -political tool, both for 4 There was , for example, a grou ndswell of postwar German opposition to jazz in the pages of the radio magazine H\u00f6r Zu in 1947 (Badenoch 2008: 71). In these circumstances, Jazzfreunde banded together into an association, the Deutsche Jazz F\u00f6deration [The German Jazz Fed eration], that mig ht act as a 'bulwark ' against the prevalent 'jazz defamation ' ('DJF Bollwerk [DJF 'Afro -Americanophilia' Became Polyphilia PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 5 strategies of personal distinction, that is for seeking to draw a t hick lin e between oneself and the recent past, and also for a broader, informal type of 'dena zification,' which might be carried out by 'liberal watchdog' Jazzfreunde . This latter possibility was of great import to Berendt. During the late 1940s and 1950s, in part icular, he repeatedly pointed to the National Socialists' ideological opposition to jazz, sugge sting that jazz was inherently 'international,' opposed in its deepest nature to 'authori tarian' behaviour, and that it even 'inoculated' against totalitarianism , as he put it in his rebuttal to Adorno in 1953 (1953b: 890). Jazz, therefore, could act as a tool with which to overcome the disastrous tradition of German (cultural) nationalism. In his vie w, it was therefore vital to rehabilitate jazz in postwar German y given that jazz ging ... um etwas Gesellschaftliches, im Grunde Politisches. Es ging darum, damentally political. It concerned making cultural life in our land \u2014and with it the consciousness \u2014more worldly, open and tolerant, and less nation -centric, le ss self -oriented.] Berendt's image of African -Americans in the late 1950s: 'Afro - Americanophilia' and 'colour -blindness' 'Race' played a critical yet complex role in Berendt's postwar discussions of jazz. Like other phenomena including the pub lic debates about the proper education and future that should be offered to the Afro -German children of African -American GIs and German women, and Robert Stemmle's 1952 film, Toxi, Berendt's texts about 'authentic' and 'true' jazz offer another example of how race very much continued to be a topic after the would -be caesura of 1945, even though it became a taboo.5 On the one hand, Berendt's language betrayed a distinct Afro -Americanophilia (Moritz Ege's term) based on a no doubt quite genuine love for the m usic. However, in contradistinction to the occasionally playful/ironic notion that Ege (2007) examines in relation t o the West German counter -culture of the late 1960s and early 1970s, this seems to have been a more 'serious' and morally -charged mode of Af ro-Americanophilia, more conditioned by a longer and deeper socialization in the National Socialist era, as well as by the long - running postwar battles to legitimate 'Negermusik' [Negro Music]. It found its echo in the moralising ' Stellvertreter [surrogate ] abolitionism' sentiment towards African 5 On the debates about Afro -German children, see Lemke Muniz de Faria (2002) and On (2011). Hurley How 'Afro -Americanophilia' Became Polyphilia PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 6 America that Sabine Broeck (2011) has discerned more generally in pos twar German left-liberal circles. Yet there were clear overlaps with some c ounter -culture era Afro - Americanophilia, as well as with earlier forms of Weimar -era 'Negrophilia,' especially in the form of a commonly romanticised picture of the African -American and his/her attributes. This aspect was clearly not closely grounded in Berendt 's real, if somewhat sporadic, contacts with African -American mus icians during the late 1940s and 1950s. Berendt, for example, made a beeline for Harlem soon after arri ving in the USA during his first, three -month stay in the country in 1950. He also hosted many African - American jazz musicians who were either resident i n Europe, including as servicemen, or who visited the continent to perform, including for his employer, the SWF. However, on the evidence I have seen, these do not seem to have been long -term, intimate friendships between equals.6 That said Berendt's rom anticized image of African -Americans and their 'essential' qualities was primarily borne by a highly critical attitude towa rd German (and more broadly, Western) society. To complicate matters, however, Bere ndt also looked to jazz as an important space in w hich racial difference, which he took as a given, like most of his German contemporaries of the day (Fehrenbach 2005: 150), might be creatively and productively transcended. These seemingly contradictory aspects reinforce ethnographer John Hartigan, Jr.,'s observation that individuals' 'racial thinking' can have a 'dense aspect ... wherein people may hold contradictory feelings about race' (2010: 13). They also underline the point that Berendt's prime motivation may have simpl y been to openly transvalorise Na zi racial discourse in relation to race and jazz \u2014now jazz as black, now jazz as miscegenation. Berendt gave his diagnosis of the problems which beset Germany's (postw ar) culture in various publications, including when discussing so -called Swingheinis [Swi ng Twerps] and Halbstarken [Half -Strongs], figures referred to as Juvenile Delinquents (JDs) in contemporary Anglophone parlance. Particularly in the early -to-mid 1950s, many German commentators, including Theodor Adorno, viewed these jazz and r ock 'n' rol l enthusiasts' behaviour as anything but harmless. Rather, their tendency t o 'lose control' at concerts was seen as genuinely worrying, and perhaps even proto -fascist in nature 6 On the comparative intimaci es that could and did emerge in the 1950s in the Wes t German garrison communities that hosted (African) American GI's, see especiall y H\u00f6hn (2002). Hurley How 'Afro -Americanophilia' Became Polyphilia PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 7 (see e.g. Adorno 1953 and Kotschenreuther 1956; for a summary, see Poiger 2000) . Adorno took the view that jazz was a special type of commodity offere d up by what he and Max Horkheimer (1947) famously called the Culture Industry, and which be nighted consumers. Although the improvisation that jazz exhibited seem to offer the so -called 'jazz subject' freedom, it was actually quite a tame form of freedom, and the sado - masochist (and secretly authoritarian) jazz subject even enjoyed this emasculated freedom (see generally Poiger 2000: 142 -145; Hurley 2009a: 37 -37). For Berendt, Halbstarke n and Swingheini behaviour was clearly damaging to his overarching goal of legitimating serious jazz within Germany's culture, however he al so took the view that it was psychologically understandable, and in this respect he was in ke y with the increasing ' liberal consensus' that Uta Poiger (2000) has described as emerging by the late 1950s in relation to jazz and unruly youth behaviour. In this way, B erendt was on the winning side of the West German debates about jazz, even though he emerged the loser from his public tussle with Adorno in the pages of the journal Merkur in 1953. Berendt's rather weak response to Adorno had been partly to mark off w hat he called true jazz from what Adorno mistakenly referred to as jazz, t hat is to indicate how true jazz share d many features with so -called Ernste -Musik (serious music). What Adorno thought of as jazz was actually rather worthless Schlager ('hit' or pop) music, in Berendt's view. To Berendt's disgust, Adorno was also given the las t word in the Merkur debate (Broe cking 2002). To some extent Berendt sympathised with the rowdy music enthusiasts, s omething that the horrified Adorno certainly did not do. At fault, according to Berendt , was both the highly organised and rationalised state of modern society, as well as the lack of understanding extended to these young people by the older generation (see Berendt 1958). Adopting Nietzsche's terminology, Berendt identified the true culpri t: a steady Apollinization of Western society, in which [at most now only a literary discovery that there is also a Dionysian art and cult experience alongside the Apolloni an.] Enthusiastic involvement ( begeistertes Mitgehen ) in a music club provided an important moment of Dionysian intoxication, otherwise missing from bloodless modernity. If soc iety were to better accommodate a touch of the Dionysian, he suggested, it would be all the better for it. If the nature of Western society's problems was clear to Berendt, it was also clear Hurley How 'Afro -Americanophilia' Became Polyphilia PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 8 where he looked for answers --to jazz, and beyond that to the Neger (Negro), that durable nineteenth century construct that conflated African Ameri cans with Africans of [For him [the Negro], the world h as not fallen apart into the 'secular' and the 'religious,' t he 'sensual' and the 'intellectual,' or however else you wis h to describe the dualisms, between which the dialectic play of Occidental reactions move. Music speak s to him 'totally' ... or not at all, insofar as he has not reacted by taking the option open to many a modern big city Negro \u2014that of consciously complete assimilation to the white pattern of behav iour. The [Negro's] musical experience emerges from a completeness and unspoiled -ness, a tot ality, of which most modern Europeans scarcely even possess a memory any more.] Here as elsewhere, Berendt constructed an idealised image of bla ckness, which could offer postwar Germans a model for reconnecting with a lost 'Dionysia n' element, or with a more 'authentic' state of being, even if only in a small dose at a jazz club. Although positively intended, and ostensibly interested in transcending Manichae an ways of reading race, such an attitude still painted the ' Neger ' as radically other; as somehow pre-modern and as being incapable of 'suffering' from the evils of rationalised Western civilization, even if he did concede that some modern 'big city Neger' in the USA had fully assimilated to the white man's ways. Hi s picture had little to do with the complex reality of black existence(s). Nor did it, at heart, reject the stereotypes of the instinctual black person advanced by Nazi ideologues. Ra ther, it simply inverted them by giving them a positive weighting, in a similar way to the 'Negrophile' Germa n primitivists of the 1920s. And yet, Berendt's racial discourse w as brave in the context of the day, given the perceived Nazi 'carry -over,' and the extreme attitudes and threats of violence to which he, as the public face o f German Jazzfreunde , was someti mes subjected by opponents of jazz.8 His image was also not out of keeping with other attitudes current at the time, particularly in Eur ope. Charley Gerard has noted, 7 On Negrophilia of the Weimar era, see Moritz Ege's and my first jointly authored survey essay in this issue . For an analysis of how Negrophilia acted as a screen for whi te German projection, see Weiner (1991). 8 In the late 1940s, he apparently received anonymous th reats of violence in listeners' mail sent to the S\u00fcdwestfunk (South -Western Radio) that warned hi m to stop broadcasting Negermusik (Berendt 1996: 313) . Hurley How 'Afro -Americanophilia' Became Polyphilia PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 9 for example, that there has been a proportional relation between whit e jazz writers' peripherality to the African -American jazz community, and the latitude they have enjoyed to wax lyrical about what he terms the 'black mystique' (1998: 97f f). Berendt's own take on the mystique' was surely influenced by his European peri pherality. And t hat, in turn, was a result of a peripherality enforced by the Naz is\u2014many German jazz enthusiasts in the postwar era felt that they had a lot of catching up to do in terms of developments in the American jazz world that they had missed out upon du ring the eight years of Nazi rule \u2014and by the extant European, especially French, jazz literature, much of which was highly romanticised (Gennari 2006: 57 -58). Whilst Berendt was quick to identify what he called the 'Crow Jim' tendencies in Europea n--and particularly French --jazz talk (1956b), he was not able to entirely escape the tendency to see in the African -American jazzer a form of noble savage with a trumpet.9 For all this, there was a complicating dimension to Berendt's di scussion of race, which was seemingl y in tension with the 'black mystique,' and it was here that the li nk between jazz, race, and 'inoculating' against the virus of German chauvinism may have been strongest. For Berendt, the Neger might have the secret to a more 'authentic' nature. However, jazz also offered up a vision of an integrated society in which rac e no longer mattered. In this way, Berendt's language prefigures some of the white would -be 'colourblind' multiculturalism of the present -day, discussed in Ege's and my second joint essay i n this issue (see also Hartigan 2010: ix; El Tayeb 2011). Berendt ma de the link between jazz and a post -racial state of affairs in several ways. Primarily, he note d that there had been 'mixing' --both on -stage and in the audience --in southern American jazz concerts at a time when Jim Crow segregation was still the rule (1956b). Citing examples where white musicians had employed African -Americans, Berendt even asserted that jazz had contributed more to the overcoming of segregat ion than anything else. In this respect, he quoted Louis Armstrong with approval: 'Jazz ist ein gro\u00dfa (1956b) [Jazz is a 9 Other types of literature may well have had an influence on Berendt as well, including the 'Negritude' poetry of Aime Cesaire and Leopold Senghor. Negritude attempted to counte r Western racism toward s the African by reversing racist discourse, and revalorizin g precisely those attributes (including, for example, intuition) which racism denigrated (McLeod 2000: 7 7-78). Berendt was a great appreciator of poetry and one of his pet projects was to create r adio programs in which poetry was presented, often with a backing of modern jazz (Meifert 1999; Hurley 2010). He ass embled at least one such program with Cesaire's and Senghor's poetry ('Jazz und Dichtung' [Jazz and Poetry] 1958). He was also familiar with the writings of Janheinz Jahn, the translator and German po pularizer of Negritude, whom Senghor made honorary consul for Senegal 1965 1956b). Hurley How 'Afro -Americanophilia' Became Polyphilia PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 10 marvelous tool in the racial question. It makes people wonderfully c olour -blind]. This idea that jazz was a way of creatively surmounting racism --and even of turning existing tensions between the races into a dynamic, positive, artistic outc ome--was and is a common trope within the liberal jazz literature, irrespective of the authors' nationalit y (DeVeaux 1997: 18 -19).10 In the USA, its strongest advocate during the 1950s was Leonard Feather. He elevated the art of using jazz criticism as a venue to urge for colour -blindness to the point where interracialism became an id\u00e9e fixe that perhaps colour ed, as it were, his objectivity as a critic (Gennari 2006: 56). Feather's investment in the dream of a colour -blind world, for which jazz stood as a cipher, was partly borne of his status as a European Jew \u2014he was born in England and later migrated to the USA\u2014who had lived through the Hitler years (Gennari 2006: 58). As we have se en, Berendt had a slightly different investment in the same project. How ever, any current discussion of the notion of aspirational colour -blindness must register two facts. First, ignoring race is a privilege to which not all have access (Hartigan 2010: ix). Second, attaining a state of colour -blindness does not at all preclude the continuation of racial discrimination. Citing Eduardo Bonilla -Silva's recent work on 'racism without ra cists' in the USA, John Hartigan Jr asks, for example: 'How is it poss ible to have this tremendous degree of racial inequality in a country where most whites claim that race is no longer relevant?' (2010: 8 -9). For Berendt, the 'colour -blinding' aspect of jazz was based in an interpretation of the racial genesis of the music, which, it should be noted, he made in t he absence of detailed ethnomusicological training or analysis. Put simply, jazz w as racially indeterminate; a radically hybrid form, it was bot h black and white, and was not imaginable without the presence of each element in dynamic tension wit h the other (Berendt n. d. a). As he observed in the 1953 Jazzbuch , for example, 'Nur (19 13) is only in the interaction of 'black' and 'white' that jazz comes into bei ng and persists]. In this way, he attempted to hold a position within German jazz debates equa lly distanced from both the so -called 'African Party' (Berendt n. d. b) of writers such as the musicologist Alfons M. Dauer, who by the mid - to late 1950s had made detailed analyses of the African roots of jazz, and those, such as the discographer and chronicl er of jazz in Germany Horst H. Lange who, somewhat peculiarly, publishe d an article in 1960 10 For a more recent variant, see Sudhalter (2001: xvii) . Hurley How 'Afro -Americanophilia' Became Polyphilia PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 11 declaring that jazz was actually a creation of whites (Dauer 1958; 1961; Lange 1960). Berendt attempted to distance himself from this debate about the ra cial heritage of jazz, by suggesting that both extreme positions were unsustainabl e, and actually said more about the speaker than they did about jazz. They indicated: da\u00df die Frage, was \"afrikanisch\" und beweisen.\" (Berendt n. d. b) [The question of what is \"African\" and what is \"European \" in jazz is without objective meaning .... It can only be answered subjectively -relative ly-psychologically ... Jazz is something new, of itself, and in itself complete and ... as with all such art forms, critic s and musicians project into it that which suits their own situation ... And everyone can prove his/her vie w \"scientifically.\"] Bere ndt's radically relativist statement was, of course, perhaps m ost revealing about himself. It showed his disdain for academic musicology, and for scie ntific method in general, which would manifest itself later in his writings about Weltmusik . Just what sort of jazz was Berendt referring to? Was all jazz devoid of al l Africanisms, for example? The statement also hinted that Berendt's position about the r adical racial indeterminacy of jazz might have its own psychological motivations. Thes e, once again, related partly to Berendt's attempt to use jazz as a tool to overcome t he German past. As we saw, it had, among other things, been precisely the racial indeterminacy of jazz which had so aggravated Nazi ideologues. Here too, Berendt flipped the N azi discourse about race and jazz on its head. 'Miscegenation' becomes a virtue ra ther than a vice. I have shown elsewhere how this argument performed a type of transposed or s urrogate philosemitism (Hurley 2008). Whilst billing jazz as a hybrid of uncertain makeup, Ber endt showed great interest in those musicians who confounded jazz criticism's traditional descriptor s of black and white. There were, as he observed in 1956, strange reversals of the usual musical 'responsibilities' within jazz groups and it was no longer possible, even for the expert, to determine just by listening whether a black or white musician w as playing (1956b).11 Moreover, in the context of that French/European 'Crow Jim' tendency to valorise black 11 He was here no doubt referring to the famo us 'blindfold test' that Leonard Feather conducted in 1951 with the black trumpeter Roy Eldridge for Downbeat magazine. Eldridge had boasted about being able to determine a player's racial background just by listening; however, whe n put to the test, he was confounded. Berendt also conducted such blindfold tests for the SWF during the 1950s and made a similar experience (Berendt 1956a; Gennari 2006: Polyphilia PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 12 musicians simply on the basis of their skin colour, Berendt called on jazz fans and writers to speak less about skin and more about music, an appeal echoe d by several other German jazz writers at the time (Berendt 1953a: 13; Bere ndt n. d. a; Rosenberg 1961). And yet, just as Berendt's publications sometime s advanced a romanticised reading of the Neger , they also continued to apply the epithet 'black' as a musical descriptor (1953a: 26; 1960: 40). In the very article in which he appeale d to fans not to focus on skin colour, he engaged in a speculative analys is of the ways in which black musicians were 'better' than white musicians and vice versa. W hilst concluding that each was better in his own way (black musicians tended to be more innovative, but white musicians tended to be more technically proficient), o ne must nevertheless query why, if it was necessary for others to focus less on race, Ber endt himself entered into a hair-splitting analysis of the intersection between race and jazz aest hetics (n. d. a: 4). Whilst Berendt's 1940s and 1950s discussions ab out jazz and race were pitted against (and inverted) Nazi notions that were thought to have 'carried over' into postwar Germany, in another way it occurred within a 'friendly' environment; there was not any serious disputation about the 'relationships of r epresentation.' As we have seen, Berendt's language was consistent at different times not only with other European attitudes about jazz, but also with the liberal ideas of the promi nent English -American jazz critic, Leonard Feather. By the mid -1960s, howev er, a more strident mode of African -American cultural politics was asserting itself within jazz criticism in the USA. This put into question not only Berendt's role as a white jazz criti c; it also attacked his notion of jazz as being a site or model for th e creative overcoming of racism and the building a post -racial world. 1960s -1970s: countering the Afrocentric turn The 1960s saw an increasing politicization among many American jazz m usicians and critics, particularly in the second half of the decade. This tendency was often twinned with a preference for free jazz, which emerged towards the end of the 1950s in the practice of Ornette Coleman and others, and in which there was a 'subversion of the various jazz conventions' (Gioia 1997: 344). The notion o f freedom was now raised vigorously within the contexts of both avant -garde jazz and the Civil Rights movement, and the one soon found reflection in the other (Gioia 1997: 338). Various mode rn jazz compositions serve to illustrate the point, including Max Roach's We Insist: Freedom Hurley How 'Afro -Americanophilia' Became Polyphilia PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 13 Now Suite (1961) (Jost 1973). During the 1960s (free) jazz aesthetics and the politics of African American emancipation were also united in a newly critic al, sociologically grounded jazz discourse, which self -consciously broke wi th the liberal consensus among established (white) critics. The sociohistorical context is important here. It involved a growing disillusionment among African Americans about the possibility of a peaceful integrat ion into white American society. In this setting, Black cultural separatism and militant Black Nationalism were in the ascendency. In the jazz world, these phenome na manifested themselves in the more militant stance --the 'Black music ideology' (Gerard 1998) -- adopted by some African American music ians and critics toward what they regarded as their musical property (Jost 1982: 176 -177; Budds 1990: 116 -127). According to Gerard, 'Black music ideologists are offended that each style of j azz ... has been appropriated from the African American community almost from the day after it was first heard there.' Further, these writers argued that stylis tic change should not be explained by would -be aestheticist interpretations; it was 'not the result of m usical development per se but of sociopolitical events af fecting the African American community' (1998: 6, 35). The critic who contributed the foundational text to the Black music ideology was Amiri Baraka (LeRoi Jones), who published his influe ntial study Blues People in 1964. Baraka's writing became more polem ical and assertive and exclusionary on racial issues in the mid -1960s, when he adopted Islam and a new name, and left his white wife, Hettie. Baraka then became a 'lightni ng rod of cultural combat' (Gennari 2006: 279ff, 279). Others, such as the free jazz saxophonist Archie Shepp and the American Marxist historian Frank Kofsky, as well as the Fr ench Leftist critics Philippe Carles and Jean -Louis Comolli followed Baraka's lead, outlining the links between free jazz, the Black music ideology, and a critique o f the white -run 'culture industry,' to borrow works by Baraka, and Carles and Comolli appeared in translation in the late 1960s and 1970s, and younger '68er' music critics such as the Frankfurter Rundschau 's [Frankfurt Review's] Wilhelm Liefland, now also began to advance a Leftist view which interpreted jazz's development (and the 12 See Gennari (2006: 251ff). As these critical perspectives were being advanced, some musicians were also attempting to form alternative models for the diffusion of their music, including 'rebel' festivals and collectively run record labels (Jost 1982: 211 -222; Gerard 1998: -Americanophilia' Became Polyphilia PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 14 emergence of free jazz) in a materialist, sociologically grounde d fashio n.13 This approach was thoroughly opposed to Berendt's notion of a continuous, and as they would have it 'aestheticist,' jazz development (see Liefland 1975; 1976) . The 'aggressively liberal' Berendt watched these developments with extremely mixed feelings . On the one hand, he reveled in his status as Germany's most prominent jazz authority and did not wish to dissociate himself from the emergent t rends. He ensured, for example, that Max Roach's Freedom Now suite was not only released locally (on the Philip s/twen imprint) in 1962, but also that it became the subject of a SWF te levision special in 1964. He invited Archie Shepp, then one of the most strident a dvocates of the Black music ideology, to participate in the prestigious Donaueschingen Musiktage [Dona ueschingen Music Days] and the Berliner in 1967. He also referred \u2014albeit tangentially \u2014to Black music ideology in his treatment of free jazz in the 1968 edition of the Jazzbuch (1968: 41). However, Berendt also gently distanced himself from that ideology during the 1960s and 1970s. He thought it 'tragic,' for example, that militant Africa n-American hard bop musicians excluded white jazzmen from performing with them, even if he thought that their stance was psychologically unders tandable (1962: 41). When introducing Shepp to German jazz enthusiasts, he tempered the saxophonist's strongest st atements \u2014'I am an American Negro. Of course I'm angry' \u2014with his own more conciliatory gloss: 'But if the esthetic is Black, it need certainly not be exclusive. It simply asks to be taken on its own terms' (Berendt & Shepp 1967).14 Elsewhere, he stressed that the Black music ideology was but a minority perspective (Berendt 1966a; 1966b: 149; 1967a: 349; 1968: 41). So far, the picture is of a liber al humanist who, in the interests of democracy and tolerance, is prepared to discuss more extreme views, something w hich he had prided himself upon in the 1950s (Berendt 1956c). Increasingly however, Berendt also began to express alarm at the para llels h e discerned between Black Nationalist statements and Nazi ideology --and this stance drove him eventually to harshly criticize the former. For example, in a 1970 essay in the 13 On the West German reception during the 1960s and 1970s of B araka's works, a s well as of other texts by Black nationalists such as Eldridge Cleaver, see Ege (2007). 14 In a contemporaneous review music, records]. Hurley How 'Afro -Americanophilia' Became Polyphilia PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 15 Frankfurter Hefte , in which he examined a dispute between the African -American authors and critics, Eldridge Cleaver and James Baldwin, he reflect ed on: secret \u2014fascist of the \"Black Nation,\" of the new \"Black Nationalism,\" which motivated the black playwright Ler oi Jones ... to make the following comment in a Spiegel interview: \"In a certain way we conceive of ourselves as nationalists,\" and then [he added] quite by -the-by, and all the more revealing because of it, \"and Germans must know what nationalism is.\"] He also openly exterminations since Hitler's attempt to destroy the Jews are now taking place on African s oil. Do America's blacks want to create in the USA similar political conditions to those [that exist] in Africa?] Berendt's view was most strongly advanced in 'Sch\u00f6nheit, die ich meine : der neue Faschismus in Jazz und Rock' [Beauty in Mind: The New Fasci sm in Jazz and Rock], a controversial essay written in late 1975 and published in a range of diff erent locations over the next three years.15 This essay speculated about whether some of the popular music of the 1970s betrayed worrying 'fascistoid' tendencie s. Although the essay was clearly inspired by the opinions of Leonard Feather, as well as by S usan Sontag's 1975 'Fascinating Fascism' essay on the Nazi era filmmaker, Leni Riefenstahl, and her re - emergence as a stills photographer of African tribesmen in the 1970s, it was also very much in keeping with a West German 'liberal watchdog' things, Berendt was now particularly critical of Afr ocentric Black music ideology: 15 The essay was first published in the Swiss weekly Die Weltwoche [The World's Week] in November 1975 (1975) and then republished in the German jazz journal, Jazz Podium, in January 1976 (1976b) as well a s in numerous other publications (in 1981, Berendt obs erved that the essay had been printed in 21 separate locations [Holleufer 1981: 13]). The 'defin itive' version, which he updated to answer his critic s, was then included in his 1977 -1978 compilation of essays Ein Fenster aus Jazz [A Window From Jazz] (1977: How 'Afro -Americanophilia' Became Polyphilia PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 16 Sie tun genau das, was die Nazis taten mit ihrem Bezug ... Die Nazis sprachen von und beides einander entspricht. (1976b: 10) [They are doing exactly the same thing that the Nazi s did with their recourse to German art and German thought. Blacks \u2014and indeed all of the jazz scene, including the whites, wh o are sitting in the same boat - talk of \"roots\" ... The Nazis spoke of \"Blood and Soil.\" You c an show right down to the smallest detail just how these [terms] correspond with each other.] What's more, the well -travelled Berendt diagnosed that a similar 'roo ts' talk had become endemic throughout the 'Third World' (1976a: 7). This lent what wa s essentially proto -fascist discourse an exotic flavor that could be dangerously seductive in Germany : 'Er strahlt aus fernen, fremden Welten 10). [It gets beamed from di stant and strange worlds back to ours and becomes all the more fascinating in t he process. It no longer h as the stigma of the German or Aryan]. Berendt's essay proved extremely controversial in the German jazz press; indeed it was even reported to have caused as great a splash as free jazz had f ifteen years earlier (Berendt 1976a: 6; Lindenberger 1977). Some critics objected to Berendt's speculative reading of all sorts of political 'content' into what they considered t o be a supremely non-political music (Kille 1976). Others argued that he used the term 'fascism' too loosely and that the African American min ority's focus on roots as a tool for identity building was completely different from the way in which the Nazi st ate had used 'Blood and Soil' ideology to justify its imperialist aims (Spindler 1976). K arl Heinz Nass, who was an older Jazzfreund of Berendt 's own generation, took a liberal stance, in some ways not too dissimilar from the one which Berendt had earlier pride d himself on: he respected Berendt's moral warning and thanked him for giving his reader s food for thought. However, by focusing on the wa ys in which the National Socialists had deployed art and aesthetics, he argued that Berendt had put the cart bef ore the horse: it was not aesthetics, he pointed out, that had given rise to National Soc ialism (Nass 1976). Berendt's article is certainly open to the criticism made by Lisa Gates in relation to Sontag's essay, that it involves a 'watered -down version of fascism, devoid of ... historical specificity' (1998: 239). Yet it was also understandable within the context of a postwar West Germany only too a ware of its past \u2014as well as coming from a complex man who deliberately sought to provoke ('inoculate'?) his readers (Bere ndt 1976a: 8). Hurley How 'Afro -Americanophilia' Became Polyphilia PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 17 Beyond its supposedly seductive, latent fascist traits, the stance of Black cultural nationalism --which Berendt, though a German, still had the opportunity to feel at times16--interrupted his vision of peaceful intercultural dialogue. It undermi ned the liberal notion of jazz as an emblem of the peaceful, creative overcoming of racism. It also queried his role as a white crit ic explicating a black art form. These matters were not peripheral; they were central planks in his musico -political practice and fundamental to his conviction as to the value of jazz in liberalizing postwar Germany. It was here that he lost his sympathy f or African American identity politics; they had ceased to be useful to him; in fact they had become harmful. It does not surprise then that Ein Fenster aus Jazz [A Window From Jazz] (1977 -1978) \u2014the book that contained his neo-fascism essay in its definitiv e form \u2014was seen by one German critic as an important counterweight to the 'overwrought' Black music ideology of an Ami ri Baraka or of Carles and Comolli.17 This is not to say that Berendt's views on jazz and African -American racial politics were, by this time, mainstream within the West German jazz scene. Indeed the controversy they caused suggests otherwise. The 'new fascism' essay held an important place in the intellectual frame of Berendt's 1977 book Ein Fenster aus Jazz , which marks a critical point i n his progressive estrangement from the German jazz scene. Ein Fenster aus Jazz was, as the title suggested, not only about jazz. It contained vari ous travel essays on different parts of the world which Berendt had visi ted (including Bali, the Caribbean an d Brazil) and also betrayed his increasing interest in more spiri tual matters. The book was vigorously attacked by younger critics like Lief land (Liefland 1977). Taking a lead from spiritually -inclined jazzers, such as the African -American Don Cherry, who had himself expressed criticism of the Black music ideology and urged a more ecumenical attitude (Hennessey 1966), Berendt was soon cham pioning something which he came to call Weltmusik (Hurley 2009a). This music, which was both jazz -derived, but also tran scended jazz, now became the successor to the 'international' jazz of the 1940s and 1950s \u2014it had the power to 'inoculate' against German chauvinism. 16 This was the case in 1969, for example, when it apparently marred the collegial atmosphere of one of the Free Jazz Meetings which he organized at the SWF ('Da s Free Jazz Treffen des SWF' [The SWF Free Jazz Meeting] 1970). 17 See Bachmann (1977 ). On the broader German -language attack on the position taken by Baraka, see Moritz Ege's and Detlef Siegfried's contributions to Hurley How 'Afro -Americanophilia' Became Polyphilia PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 18 1960s -1980s: Weltmusik Berendt advanced his notions of Weltmusik especially in the mid 1980s, at a time whe n marketing categories such as 'world music' and 'world beat' were in the ascendant (Taylor 1997: 1). This is not to say, however, that his notion of Weltmusik is synonymous with English -language concepts of world music as 'authentic' music from the non -European margins. As commentators like Ingrid Fritsch (1981) have observed, the German idea of Weltmusik has a long heritage, and has meant different things at different times to different people. Even before the 1980s, it had var iously referred to the idea of a 'music of the spheres,' to notions of the peaceful coexistence of the world's musical cultures, through to unifying concepts involving either the e nrichment of western music, or a truly supra -national music. In this respect it resonates particularly with German notions of Weltliteratur (world literature), advanced by German writers and thinkers including Goethe and Feuerbach. Fritsch demonstrates that Weltmusik had also been negatively associated with 'environmental noise pollution' by the West. Berend t had long engaged with notions of Weltmusik , even if he did not always use that term. Indeed, from the mid -1960s he had been involved in promoting a series of intercultural musical 'meetings,' recorded and anthologized between 1965 and 1975 as 'Jazz Meets the World.'18 These activities combined modern jazzers from North America and Europe either with their counterparts from places li ke Japan, India and Indonesia, or with practitioners of non -Western and/or folk musics. Berendt may have astutely capitalized on the growing interest of jazz musicians in non -European and/or folk musical cultures but he actively promoted such encounters, always with an eye to their ideological, extra -musical value. It is hardly a coincidence that he became more and more involved in such activities at the same time that the Black music ideol ogy was making its impact on the jazz scene, and that he was distancing hi mself from it. (In the same passage of the 1968 edition of the Jazzbuch in which he treated the impact of the Black musi c ideology on free jazz, he also discerned another trend in free jaz z, namely musicians' opening themselves up to musics outside the jazz idiom [Ber endt 1968]) Berendt's attitude to such intercultural musical encounters was ini tially experimental and somew hat hesitant, yet his language modulated in the 1970s and 1980s. It found its most fulsome expression in an important essay, published in 1985 and timed to coincide with a Weltmusik summit at the Donaueschingen Musiktage , which combined, on one 18 On this series, see generally, Hurley (2009b). Hurley How 'Afro -Americanophilia' Became Polyphilia PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 19 stage, Euro pean jazz musicians, a South American bandoneon player, Indian sarod and tabla players, a Brazilian percussionist, a Caribbean steel dr ummer, and an African American free jazz drummer.19 This Weltmusik summit and the accompanying essay must be read within Berendt's New Age turn during the early 1980s. Although, as the son of a Protestant minister, he had always had an eye to matters of the spirit, he experienced an aw akening in the early 1970s, after beginning to practise meditation (Berendt 1985a: 270). B y the beginning of the 1980s, Berendt had written a book, Nada Brahma (1983), in which he urged his readers to rediscover the atrophied sense of hearing, to perceive t he world of sound in a 'holistic' manner, and to thereby access new worlds of experience. This book became a 'cult' New Age text in Germany (Stroh 1994). That holistic New A ge context clearly lent itself to a new musical 'polyphilia,' different in quality f rom Berendt's earlier Afro - Americanophilia. As Wolfgang Martin Stroh (1994) and others h ave shown, discussions in Germany about a so -called New Age began in the late 1970s and became more prominent over the course of the 1980s. They combined various elements, spir itual, esoteric and popular -philosophical, and did so in a way that was self -consciously eclectic and associative, pointing, as Berendt did, to would -be holistic unities. They were deliberately critical of instrumental rationalism and sought to 'argue' their case by analogy. Functionally, the New Age seems to have accommodated multipl e needs, including, for example: a post -1968 disillusionment with the possibilities of radical political change and a concomitant shift to a more personal 'new subj ectivity;' a post - materialist rejection of the rational West's focus on progress at the expe nse of the natural environment; spiritual yearnings relating to a balanced, meani ngful existence as well as to having new experiences; a disappointment with the spiritual life offered by the traditional Churches; and \u2014so its critics argued \u2014a dissatisfaction with the breakdown of grand narratives in an era of post -modernity (Stroh 1994: 9 -11, 24 -26).20 New Age culture in Germany therefore fits within the Alternative , post counter -culture, new social movement milieu (on this milieu see Reichardt & Sieg fried 201 0; Reichardt 2014). The non -European had an important place in the New Age formation. Indeed, Stroh discerns five important 'dimensions' to New Age era philosophy and music, with the 'transcultural' dimension being vital. 19 For a f ull account of his late notion of Weltmusik , see Hurley (2009a). 20 For other, more recent, analyses of the New Age move ment in a West German context, see Eitler (2007, 2010, 2011). Hurley How 'Afro -Americanophilia' Became Polyphilia PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 20 The transcultural dimension of Ne w Age era music was itself deliberately eclectic. Whereas 'Crow Jim' jazz enthusiasts, or at least some of the m, had been especially interested in African -American musical culture, the 'source' musics for the New Age movement typically came from various pa rts of the non -European world, including, for example, India, Indigenous Australia and elsewhere. These 'traditiona l' musics were musical experiences], as well a s to assist, for example, in achieving and maintaining a meditative state. Critics of this iteration of Weltmusik would say that it was far less interested in difference \u2014including, say, in relation to sociopolitical context and musical manifestations of cu lture or 'race' (Africanisms and so on) \u2014than in would - be underlying unities, or holistic musical 'universals.' Berendt's essay '\u00dcber Weltmusik ' (1985b) was ostensibly thoroughly interested in this idea of ecumenical universals, even if \u2014in the associative style of the New Age \u2014it withdrew from making arguments as such, relying instead on the power o f analogy. The essay was actually remarkably defensive, attempting especially to counter the Leftist notion of 'environmental noise pollution,' held dear by soci ologically -minded jazz critics who highlighted the commercial operation of the West's cul ture industry. It was in this defensive setting that Berendt called upon his experiences prom oting the intercultural music encounter. Choosing to ignore the commercial context, he instead used a curious language of courtesy and of hybridization to privilege such enc ounters. These became a highly productive moment, during which participant -musicians obligingly accommodated themselves to the musical idioms of their partne rs\u2014but communicated via common colour -blinding musical 'universals' \u2014and then came away reinvigorated afterwards. This deliberately sexualized moment led, in Berendt's view, to the diversification of musical cultures, rather than to their leve lling. In othe r words, he is able to main some investment in difference, even if the univers al is trump. If one had to isolate the dominant ideas in the article, they would be the notion of music as having some overarching universal aspect \u2014one that may be accessed by a spiritually inclined, wilfully colour -blind musician \u2014allowing communication across cultural difference, as well as the value of ongoing cultural hybridization. This idea was aga in shot through with the recent history of German racial thinking \u2014and especiall y Nazi opposition to racial (and musical) miscegenation. Berendt's notion of culture se ems to be conflated at times with race and he deliberately links the notion of hybridising Weltmusik , and Hurley How 'Afro -Americanophilia' Became Polyphilia PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 21 opposition thereto, with Nazi era anti -miscegenation ideology ( Berendt 1985b). This is consistent with what Uli Linke has observed in her work on race and r epresentation after Hitler; certain genealogical tropes and metaphors, including of blood, race and bodies appear in what she calls a 'frozen continuum' (1999: 23) .21 Hence, the polyphilic Weltmusik encounter was, in some ways, a successor to the earlier notion of jazz as a creative transvalorization of earlier racialised thinking, a posi tion now made increasingly difficult by the spread of Black music ideology. Wher eas jazz was once the gift of African -America, a 'universal language' able to be spoken by musicians with different cultural heritages, that role was now taken on by a polyphil ic notion of Weltmusik . Any musician could participate, no matter the cultural b ackground; one just needed to be open enough. Yet Berendt's late notion of Weltmusik , and his advancement of other dimensions of New Age music were domains which only a few in the German jazz scene were interested in entering (Knauer 2009). This is not t o say that his interventions fell on deaf ears; he attained a high profile and commercial success in the N ew Age market, and this persisted until his death in 2000. By the 1980s and early 1990s, however, ther e was probably rather more comfort in the West G erman jazz scene, particularly amongst younger critics, with the critical, sociologically grounded analyses of jazz which Baraka had inaugurated, even if here too many German commentators exhibited an ongoing if slightly different sensitivity to the legaci es of National Socialist ideology. This is evident, for example, in the articles of Stephan Voswinkel and of P eter Niklas Wilson, who both took Berendt's theory of Weltmusik to task. Voswinkel (1985) and Wilson (1987) advanced a more 'anxious' notion of th e spread of western music than Berendt, seeing it as consistent with the history and after -effects of colonialism. Indeed, for them Weltmusik was a re -run of colonialism, with the 'Third World' supplying the raw materials to the rapacious west.22 Importantl y, these critics also took issue with Berendt's notion of musical universals, considering them to be another instance in which the west imposed its own criteria onto difference, thereby uni versalizing the Self. Moreover, the New Age holism of Berendt's Weltmusik utopia was criticised by German commentators for seeking to expunge difference and dissidence, and itself being totalitarian and proto -fascist (see Sloterdijk 1987: 101; Wilson 1990: 68). For 21 For another attack on the language of hybridity and hybr idization, see Hu tnyk (2000). 22 On the 'anxious' discourse about world music, see Be nnettt (2005). See, also generally, Hurley (2009a). Hurley How 'Afro -Americanophilia' Became Polyphilia PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 22 both groups then \u2014Weltmusikfreunde [friends of Weltmusik ] and Weltmusikgegner [Opponents of Weltmusik ]\u2014there were worrying legacies of National Socialist ideology; they just manifested themselves in different ways. Berendt identified in those who sought to defend non -European cultures against 'environmental noise pollution' a secretly racist legacy of anti -miscegenation; his younger critics stressed the 'totalitarianism' in his universalising discourse. Conclusions For Berendt, race figured in important, if contradictory, ways duri ng the 1950s and beyond. During the postwar era, it was employed in two separate strands of a c ultural critique directed at Germany. First, a highly positive Afro -Americanophile image of the Neger provided Berendt with a foil with which to criticize the lament able spiritual state of Ger man, and, more broadly, Western society. In this respect, he was not so much openly critical of recent German history --although that was always a theme running under the surface --but rather of the bloodless nature of German modernity. This strand had firm roots in the earlier ideas of primitivism and Negrophilie , that had been current in metropolitan circles in large cities like Berlin in the de cade of his birth, the 1920s. Recent German history featured far more strongly in the second str and of Berendt's thinking about race in the 1950s. In it, he pondered the possibility of a race less, colour - blind society, in which --by extension --the racial crimes of National Socialism would not be thinkable. For Berendt, post -race was never more than a utopian shimmer on the horizon; and he could never entirely live up to it (even in his own world o f jazz criticism, terms such as black and white were too ensconced to be dispensed with). However, for him it represented a worthy goal, and he would, presumably, have been extremely disappointed by the persistence of real racial discriminati on in an ostensibly colour -blind society, as diagnosed by recent scholars like Bonilla -Silva. What united the diverse strands of Berendt's talk about race and jazz in the 1940s a nd 1950s was the way in which they self -consciously (or otherwise) distanced themselves from National Socialist racial ideas about jazz as black, or jazz as misc egenation. In this way they performed a similar intellectual exercise to Negritude ; they inverted the forme rly stigmatised, but they did so from a different (white) subject posit ion, than that of an Aime Cesaire or a Leopold Senghor. The Nazi denigration of the insti nctual black man became Berendt's valorization of the Neger 's standing outside Western dualisms; Hurley How 'Afro -Americanophilia' Became Polyphilia PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 23 hybrid jazz moved from being spurned as a figure of miscegenation to being ne cessary to bring about a new post -racial world. By the mid -to-late 1960s, however, the face of jazz criticism was changing abroad, and, to a lesser extent, at home. In the USA, Black music ideology emerged to take white critics to task, as well as their liberal notions of jazz's development and its privileged role in the creative overcoming of racism. Berendt's German peri pherality to the US jazz scene shielded him from the most heated confrontations over the racial ownership of jazz. For a while, he could express a type of sympathy for it. O n occasion, he might even assist in propagating a type of Afrocentrism that was close t o the 'roots' talk he elsewhere decried. In 1971, for example, Berendt produced the expatriate African - American drummer Billy Brooks's El Babaku (MPS 15314). This was a highly Afrocentric album that also included a lament to the dead Black nationalist leader, Malcolm X. In the album's cover notes Berendt even allowed Brooks to reflect on the 'power and subjection' in the 'African way.' We can only understand this seeming anomaly by looking for the consistency between Brooks's anti -European image of 'Africa' \u2014he uses 'Africa' as an 'Other' to the inauthentic Wes t (Brooks \u2014and with Berendt's own anti -European, Afro -Americanophile, Nietzschean ideas in the 1950s, with his notion of the more 'authentic' noble savage with a trumpet . Practically, El Babaku also met Berendt's desire to complete his ambitious Jazz Meets The World series with a 'Jazz Meets Africa' type of record. By and large, however, Berendt looked elsewhere during the 1970s and 1980s than t o Afro -Americanophilia, and jazz for a musico -political site at which to continue his 'liberal watchdog' at tempts at cultural denazification. He found this in Weltmusik , an emergent site at which a newer, vaguer and seemingly less charged type of polyphilia might be advanced. Yet this notion, which was twinned with an attack on Black nationalism, was not at all uncontroversial in Germany. Following from Amiri Baraka's lead in relation to a sociological, materialist approach to jaz z criticism, a new generation of 68er German jazz critics began to attack Berendt on various leve ls. Inter alia this extended to his ' aetheticist' interpretation of jazz's development, and to his te ndency to 'sacralize' or spiritualize jazz. Berendt's racial thinking also began to be attacked too. For example, he was attacked by some for his failure to understand how, in a US Hurley How 'Afro -Americanophilia' Became Polyphilia PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 24 context, 'r oots' talk might be productive, as opposed to 'fascistoid' [proto -fascist].23 Moreover, Berendt's New Age model of polyphilic Weltmusik was itself thought by some younger critics to be secretly fascistoid , albeit in another way. Even though it seemed to be in favour of the diversification of cultures, it crushed difference and dissidence in the moment at which it sought to universalize. In this way, too, the perceived legacies of National Socialism continued to feed into Ger man music debates well after the f act. Berendt's long career in writing, radio and music production stret ched from 1945 until his death in 2000. By tracking the changes in the ways he discussed race and jazz, and then Weltmusik , we can see how durable Afro -Americanophile thought could be in twentieth century Germany. Berendt's moralizing, postwar ideas w ere conditioned by the legacies of Negrophile thought of the 1920s and by the shock of Nazi opposition to jazz and (musical) miscegenation. His case confirms the insights of scholars like U li Linke (1999) who have discerned threads in twentieth century German at titudes to race, both in relation to the continuation \u2014often through simple inversion \u2014of ideas about racial difference, and about the enduring power of genealogical tropes in German thought. Berendt was embattled at different times in his career, including early on by unambiguous anti -black racists who strongly objected to Negermusik . I have argued that his latterday rejection of Afro -Americanophilia in favor of polyphilic Weltmusik cam e about partly from Black music ideology -inspired debates in US, and to a lesser extent European, jazz circles. However, many of the ideas that he advance d about Weltmusik were very similar ones to those that he had raised in relation to jazz, butwhich had become more difficult to espouse there. So although in his case the re appears to be a rupture with others' Afro -Americanophilia, there is a continuation of the metaphors and tropes that he had advanced in the earlier setting. The other point of significan ce is that Berendt's arguments in relation to jazz and then Weltmusik largely occurred in isolation from the Others living in Germany, be they Afro -Germans or the postwar labour migrants (compare Voswinkel 1985). Like other white left -liberals after the wa r and up until the emergence of a strong Afro -German voice in the 1980s, he retained a great deal of latitude to espouse on matters of race, and its would -be absence (Broeck 2011). 23 This is not to say, however, that all younger German critics were welcoming of all aspects of Baraka's discourse.

PORTAL is published under the auspices of UTSePress, the late 1960s Moritz Ege, Ludwig Maximilian University Munich I. 'Yippie! I was in the right place at the right time!'\u2014reflecti ng on her years in Munich in the late 1960s and early 1970s, African American singer, actress and model Donna Summer exudes enthusiasm. Why, and it what sense, was this the right time? In her 2003 autobiography, Summer and her ghostwriter Marc Eliot make sense of her German experience by explaining to their international audience: 'Liberal postw ar generation Germans living in Munich wanted to make some personal kind of stateme nt about the Civil Rights Movement in America. Frequently that statement took t he form of friendship, support, and work for anyone of color who happened to be from the Sta tes' (Summer 2003: 56). Certainly, Summer was right when she noticed a peculiar interest , a peculiar predilection, in Munich and beyond. She located this within a specific milieu, and maybe, to use a much-maligned term, in the Zeitgeist more generally. Having arrived in 1968 as a singer for the musical Hair , Summer, the later 'disco queen,' stepped right into the contradictions of that famous 'moment' of cultural and politi cal upheaval, that is, in its local, German version.1 Questions of exoticism, guilt, otherness and 1 The literature on that cultural moment is large and cont inues to grow; for an overview with a focus on genealogy and the intersection of discourses of youth, politics, and consump tion, see Siegfried (2006). Ege Becoming Black PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 2 'becoming -minor' (Deleuze & Guattari 1986) contributed significantly to the contradictions that characterize this historical moment in Germa ny. While straight - forward anti -black racism remai ned a stark reality in large parts of society, gestures of appreciation as mentioned by Summer did reach beyond a few urban, bohemia n circles. In West -German culture in the late 1960s and in the early 1970s, as I argue in this paper, there was indeed a sig nificant and specific pattern of what can be termed Afro - Americanophilia, involving affirmative or even worshipful approaches t o, and appropriations of, African American culture and politics, which oft en, although not always, included a desire for African Americans.2 Such encounters were part of a flourishing 'Black cultural traffic' (Jackson 2005). Analytically spe aking, of both postcolonial \u2014a few years after formal decolonization of many African nations \u2014and heg emonically US -American, yet its patterns and politics had a peculiar local tone. When British cultural critic Kobena Mercer (1994) wrote that around 1968 in the USA and the UK many white rebels apparently wished to 'become black,' he could also have exten ded his analysis to the German context. Following Summer's and Merce r's lead, this paper focuses on two manifestations of Afro -Americanophilia: first, a radical countercultural group from Berlin, the so -called 'Blues'; and second, the reception of soul mus ic in the counterculture and the pop -cultural mainstream. In a particularly condensed form, the two case studies enable us to trace the cultural dynamics of Afro - Americanophilia and discuss their larger cultural significance in G ermany around 1968. To many young ('white') Germans, African American culture and politics pr ovided 'lines of flight' from outdated modes of subjectivity; 'lines of fli ght' which were ethically embedded and physically tangible. In different ways, these t endencies resonated with: (a) radical, anti -imperialist politics; (b) countercultural sensibilities, where Black American culture provided a radically contemporary crit ique of (white) European modernity; (c) the racialized, in w hich 'the repressed' was to be brought back to the surface; and (d) a consumer -based economy and pop culture, which supported the incorporation, domestication and aestheticization of differences, desires and confl icts. 2 The term is coined in slightly satirical reference to the 1 920s concept of 'Negrophilia.' See the introduction to this journal issue for further reflections on the term, as well as Ege (2007) and Broeck (2010). Ege Becoming Black PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 3 In Germany, one generation after th e Holocaust and the collapse of National Socialism, blurring the lines between what was one's own and what was alien ( fremd ), reversing the aesthetic and moral hierarchy of anti -black racism, seemed like a particularly noble endeavour. However, this fed on a tradition of exoticism and as many \u2014particularly Black intellectuals such as James Baldwin \u2014already pointed out at the time, the politics of exoticism are ambivalent at best.3 Afro -Americanophilia could be highly paternalistic, fetishizing or controlling, good intentions notwithstanding. Taking up Donna Summer's brief observation cited at the beginning of this essa y, the reader may have noticed that her wording also implied that people of colour from Ge rmany and from places other than North America appeare d to be excluded from this unexpected and undifferentiated love, as were most of the South European labour mi grants who were arriving in the country in those years. In some cases, nonethele ss, this selective, erotically charged exoticism also led to tangib le solidarity and strong connections between white Germans and African Americans. The point of this paper, then, is not to argue that Afro -Americanophilia offers the key to understanding the era, or that it was a good or a bad thing. I want to be careful to illuminate cultural texture, contexts, and normative ambiguities ra ther than deduce meanings from pre -given assumptions. Putting the phenomenon in analytical focus, (re)constructing it intellectually from various sources, from the gr ound up, as a subcul tural style and a larger current, may help us understand important tra nsformations in postwar German history \u2014generational, cultural, and political \u2014in a more nuanced way, by linking (sub -)cultural practices and identities, as well as consumer culture , which figure prominently in '1968' historiography, to questions of 'race,' w hiteness and difference. Overall, I argue that in those years, the mode in w hich many 'white' Germans related to racial others and to otherness changed significa ntly: it foregrounded connectedness and symbolic incorporation, while maintaining (and libidinally cha rging) cultural distance and racialization. In doing so, it prefigured a m ore diverse, yet hardly post-racist or post -racial, present. Another context needs to be borne in mind . At the time, West Germany was home to tens of tens of thousands, rather than millions, of people of various or igins who would, in the language of the era, be classified as schwarz (black), farbig (coloured), or as 3 See Baldwin (1961: 217 -221, 228 -231). Ege Becoming Black PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 4 Neger (negro) [sic].4 Black people in Ge rmany, Black Germans and temporary residents, were neither particularly numerous nor particularly voca l as political agents on a larger scale.5 Furthermore, immigration was still widely considered under a Gastarbeiter (guest worker) paradigm, which reinfor ced the idea of an essentially white German nation, during the very moment when a large amount of labour migr ation from Southern Europe was taking place. II. Finding examples for Afro -Americanophilia in the late 1960s and 1970s is not difficult. Sociocul tural analyses such as Eldrige Cleaver's Soul on Ice (1968; German translation, 1969) were reviewed enthusiastically among German intellectuals.6 Soul music, which is about African American experience and largely presented as an i rreducibly Black form of p opular musical expression, succeeded commercially and found its way int o the hearts, minds and movements of millions on a nearly world -wide scale, including in Germany. The slogans and gestures of the Black Power Movement found imit ators in demonstrations \u2014where thousands of Germans were also heard chanting, 'We are all Black!' \u2014and in night life. Voluminous hairstyles were approvingly referred to as Afro- Frisuren (Afro -haircuts). A radical left -wing author from Berlin, taking up a popular trope, termed his h ome district, Kreuzberg, 'Westberlins Harlem,' the Harlem of West 4 The term 'Afro -German' was popularized by a group of Black German wri ters in the 1980s. References are given in the second jointly authored survey essay by Andr ew Hurley and me in this special issue. 5By 'black'/'Black' ( schwarz /Schwarz ), I mean people who be classified into a catego ry such as 'of African descent' within the logics of racialized disco urse. It would, for instance, include African American GIs, Afro -Germans, and Africans or African immigrants in Germany , irre spective of their actual skin tone (though not other people of colour such as Southern European immigrants). 'White' (wei\u00df ) designates Germans who are, in that same discourse, considered members of the racially unmarked category. Depending on context, in t he usage of categories like 'African American' and ' may be foregrounded. The words 'Black' and 'white' could be put in quotation marks throughout this e ssay, as they refer to socially and historically mutable classificato ry categories, not to biological fact, and reiterating the terms without linguistic markers of their constructedness may contribute to reproducing racialized categorizations one seeks to question and deconstruct. At the same time, these terms are al so highly politicized and political, both at the time and now. For that re ason, for instance, 'Black' is written with a capital 'B' when used in reference to politica l or cultural articulations that politicize an identity based on 'race' or racialization. I do not capitalize the first letter of 'white' because this aspect of identity politics does not apply in a symmetric way; but it should not be read a s being a more self -evident category. Socio cultural asymmetry can hardly be put into coherent, symmetric t erminology. In some instances, describing subjects as 'white German' (rather th an merely 'German') is helpful here because not using the racializing attribute could be read to imply \u2014wrongly \u2014that all Germans are 'white.' For a critical account of the German -language terminology, see Arndt (2004). 6 Afro -German actor Charles Huber in his autobiography writes that Cleaver's book could be found in any upper -level high school student's book bag at th e time (2004: 184), and he stresses that this coolness gave him a new self -confidence and a desire to join their cause \u2014'mich solidarisieren ,' or to solidarize himself (2004: 201). Ege Becoming Black PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 5 Berlin, and he and his circle referred to themselves as, quote, wei\u00dfe Nigger [white n*s, sic]. Magazines printed more or less explicit depictions of inter racial sex and reflected on its sign ificance. Some radical -left student groups, in their attempts at 'organizing' among GIs from the USA, exclusively approached African American s oldiers. In urban gay subcultures, too, Black people were particularly desired partners. On the other hand, theor ists like J\u00fcrgen Habermas, in quite a different tone, warned st udents not to overly identify with oppressed groups abroad, such as 'negroes in urban slums' (1968: 11f). It was apparent that he considered this a wide -spread problem. 'One thing I know for sure,' says a white German grandmother in Lothar Lambert and Wolfra m Zobus's 1975 underground film classic 1 Berlin Harlem , 'black is \"in\" today.' These examples, some of which I will return to, cross a range of cultural fields/spheres: pop music, radical politics, sexuality, consumer culture, and, most of all, counterc ultural or underground scenes. Across the spheres there are common patterns, de spite apparent tensions and enmities, in particular between the commercial and the countercultural. For the purp ose of this analysis, the years between 1967 and 1972, and arguably up until 1975, can be considered a relatively cohesive cultural moment, a tempo ral 'conjuncture of structural, cultural and biographical forces,' a 'historic i nstant in which different impulses come together and form a specific unity or Gestalt ,' as cultural analysis theorist Rolf Lindner writes, taking up the terminology of early cult ural studies and cultural anthropology (2000: 11). Methodologically speaking, if dynamics within one cultur al field \u2014such as, say, advertising \u2014are compared to those within others \u2014such as political movements, popular music, or sociocultural theory, then specif ic 'cross -field effects' may become apparent (Lindner 2003: 182). Noting such patterns, t he methodologica l challenge for cultural analysis is not only how to write a history of practices of appropriation and transfer processes across cultural spheres, but, as we will see, how to balance coherence and heterogeneity in constituting an object of study. The Afr o-Americanophile fascination itself certainly was not new. On the contrary, cultural historian Kaspar Maase, for instance, had the 1950s in mi nd when he wrote that for young Germans at the time, 'Americanization' really meant A fro-Americanization (1993; se e also Partridge 2008). And, as my and Andrew Hurley's joint survey es says in this journal issue point out, a particular fascination with Black popul ar culture in Germany reaches back well into the 19th century. Nonetheless, this historical moment Ege Becoming Black PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 6 around 1 968 is characterized by crucial transformations, both in Black diaspor ic politics, particularly in the USA, and in forms of representa tion, appropriation and interaction, within a local context. German Afro -Americanophilia of the late 1960s and early 1970s , as this paper lays out in greater detail, is characterized by a peculiar constellation of Black exclusivity and white desire. III. In the late 1960s, many people and some organized groups in West Germany wanted to support the contemporary African Amer ican freedom movement. On the German side, this included the Black Panther Solidarity Committees, groups within t he so -called GI underground (which partly overlapped), and, later on, the Angela Davis soli darity network. As historians Maria H\u00f6hn and Martin Klimke (2010) have analyzed in great detail, most of these groups arose within the anti -imperialist radical left scene of the student movement (see also Klimke (2006; 2008); Siegfried (2006); Ege (2007); and H\u00f6hn (2008)) .7 While these groups were not parti cularly large, they were highly visible, and some included leaders and protagonists of later developments, quite prom inently K. D. Wolff, head of the Frankfurt chapter of Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund (Socialist German Student Association). Many more attended their demonstrations and conferences and read the literature they translated and published. For the West German left, their US and German opponents were c losely intertwined, yet not identical. One's own government was closely allied to the USA, and the country was a crucial staging ground for the US military and its war i n Southeast Asia. Exposing and incriminating the deep -seated racism of the USA and, to a lesser extent, Germany, represented a main concern of these groups. For them, a huma nist commitment to anti -racism was a crucial lesson taken from National Socialism, however little experience they themselves might have had with that form of oppression. Strategically, leading activists were motivated to establish an anti -imperialist coali tion that would include oppressed and disaffected populations within the capita list metropoles (a 'second front'). In some cases, this solidarity work (Solidarit\u00e4tsarbeit ) 7 A few years before, Martin Luther King, Jr.'s visits to West and East Germ any (H\u00f6hn & Klimke 2010: Chapter 5) already drew a large, more popular and po litically centrist -liberal, much less subcultural crowd (20,000 people attended a sermon at West Berlin's Wald b\u00fchne, for instance). The developments of the late 1960s in Europe mu st also be seen in the context of a situation in whi ch African American activists were broadening their movement's scope towards globa l Black populations (Joseph 2007; Finzsch, Horton & Horton 1999: 490 -531; Van Deburg 1992: 112 -191). Ege Becoming Black PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 7 produced tangible results: Cooperation between African American GIs a nd predominantl y white German supporters had a significant impact on the treatment of African Americans in the US military and on German public discours e (H\u00f6hn 2008: 142f). Overall, however, such connections primarily had the function of connec ting young Germans to a wid er world, cognitively, emotionally, and culturally. For them, conservative national culture, the West German state and conventional ways of life were tainted by their association with the Hitler regime. Others, however, wanted to translate the tactics and images of radical African American groups into their own context in more immediate ways. In particular, t his was true for the so -called 'Blues' in West -Berlin, less a formally organized group than a counter - cultural urban underground scene.8 Within the fi eld of the German New Left, the 'Blues' stood out by virtue of the simultaneity and radicalism of thei r political and cultural opposition to mainstream society, by their efforts, in thei r own way, to collapse the political and the cultural sphere. In terms of self -fashioning, cultural practices, and political theory, this milieu bested all other activist groups (thr oughout German history) when it came to following African American idols. The Berlin 'Blues' must be understood in relation to developments wi thin the USA, both politically and culturally. In the mid -1960s, large segments of the African American Civil Rights movement radicalized in terms of ideology and strategy. As is widely known, the slogan 'Black Power' encapsulated a shift toward mor e milit ant, confrontational tactics and strategies. It implied affirming an African American identity, from 'coloured' or 'Negro' to 'Black' (which was, after all, ' beautiful'), and often also a move toward forms of Black Nationalism. In some prominent cases, this also meant that cooperation with 'white' supporters or members of interracial groups was rejected. Most famously, the African American organization the Student Nonviolent Coordi nating Committee (SNCC) introduced such a policy in 1966. A similar stance was taken by the most spectacular and media -savvy group of the time, the Black Panther Party (BPP) for Self -Defense, which was watched in awe and 8 Counterculture ref ers to a group that was defined by the simultaneity and radi calism of their political and cultural opposition to mainstream society (and conventi onal models of the political and the cultural sphere). What defined the counterculture in the USA and in Europe differed in some important ways.

Ege Becoming Black PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 8 admiration by 'progressive' young people, of colour and white, the world over . While the dominant factions wit hin the BPP advocated anti -imperialist internationalism, interracial cooperation within their own groups was deemed undesirable. Spokespeople such as Stokely Carmichael insisted that white sympathizers should organize within their own communities and follo w the BPP's vanguard role. Furthermore, this nationalism was highly gendered, often equating leadership with a re -articulation of oppressed Black masculinity (Finzsch 2003). Other Black nationalist fa ctions that gained visibility during those years rejecte d coalition -building with white groups altogether. Nonetheless, in the USA, some predominantly white groups within the s o-called underground modelled themselves after the most radical parts of the B lack Power movement and claimed various types of proximi ty, especially those which aimed at uniting political activism and a countercultural way of life, such a s the Yippies, the White Panther Party or, more (in)famously, the Weather Underground (J acobs 1992).9 Such identifications could reach programmatic stat us; the Weather Underground, for instance, aimed at getting rid of reactionary whiteness: 'Our political objective is the destruction of honkiness. We are going to wipe out the imperialist Sta te and every vestige of honky consciousness in white people' (Ju chler 1996: 345). Others, like Yippie activist Jerry Rubin, felt they had already left their own whiteness behind altogether. The Berlin 'Blues' followed in the footsteps of these North Americ an groups. A loose network of young people, students, artists, apprentices, young workers, and unemployed slackers, the 'Blues' comprised, or spawned, groups such as the 'B lack Rats' and the 'Tupamaros Westberlin.' Designations such as Haschrebellen (hash rebels) document the counter -cultural side of these groups. The self-styled urban guerrilla ( Stadtguerilla ) '2 June Movement' grew out of the Berlin 'Blues' scene as well; it was responsible for several bombings and bank robberies, and also for the murder of the prominent judge G\u00fcnter von Drenkmann, and the kidnapping of conservative mayoral candidate Peter Lorenz.10 The 'Blues' was anarchist -leaning, often less intellectual and more hedonistic 9 For a treatment of the internationalist and transnationa l aspects of the US Black Pant her Party, see Angelo (2009). 10 On their involvement in the bombing of the Jewish commu nity center in Berlin, one of the most crude expressions of 'anti -imperialism' as anti -semitic anti -zionism, and the importance of former situationist Ege Becoming Black PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 9 than university -based groups and student movement factions, and its members were more likely to have a working -class background . In that context, the name 'Blues' thus connoted a hedonistic approach to radical politics. According to former 'Blues' member Ralf Reinders, the term was coined by Gudrun Ensslin, the later R ed Army Faction member (and, previously, GI underground activis t). According to this account, she used the term to suggest that, in her view, not enough political activis m was being conducted in this crowd, because they spent too much time listening to music, c onsuming drugs and having sex (Ege 2007: 116 -137). A cul tural and political history of the 'Blues' scene, which is yet to be written, would have to include a long chapter on practices of appropriation from radical Black politics and from African American culture. In that context, imitating A frican American language bridged everyday aesthetics and political intent. Rather harmless political phrases and slogans were taken up, creating implicit parallels or analogies, such as when, in reference to imprisoned friends and associates, 'Free H uey' became 'Free Bommi' o r 'Free infamously, Berlin 'Blues' took up the iconography of the 'pig,' as epitomized by Black Panther Party illustrator E mory Douglas's fat, pink - colored swine. Here, 'pigs' (the English -language term was used consistently) referred not only to the police, but to the judicial system as a whole, to capi talists and managers, to the enemy as such; as the Rastafarian reference goes, to all of 'Babylon.' One 'Blues' text, the 'Aufruf gegen den Diebstahl en gros und en details der Pigs an der Menschheit' [Call to arms against the pigs' small - and large -scale theft from humanity] ( Der Blues , n. d.: 23 -35), summarizes the Manichaean worldview that was supported by the im age of 'pig': 'Besser w ach werden oder tot umfallen ' [Better for a few million pigs heads to roll now than to keep vegetating within this tired attitude towards life which will cos t us billions K.I.A. in the end. Smash the heads of the unconscious pigs until they wake up or drop dead]. Dieter Kunzelmann , see Kraushaar (2005). Tupamaros refers to the Uruguayan re bel group (named after the 18th century anticolonialist T\u00fapac Amaru II). The name 'Bewegung 2 Juni' [2 June Movement] was chosen because on that day in 1967, unarmed student Benno Ohn esorg was sho t in the head during a demonstration against the Shah of Persia by a West Berlin policem an, and a cover -up ensued, which led to a radicalization of the student movement. A collection of 'Blues' and '2 June Movement' documents, often accompanied by illustra tions by the American cartoonist, Robert Crumb, is present ed in the book Der Blues [The Blues] (n. d.). Ege Becoming Black PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 10 The verbal register was complemented by the physical. Bearing, postur e, styles of walking and salutations reflected the African American influences that the scene's name so prominently displayed.11 One 'Blues' activist, for example, remembers using the Black Panther salute, which had been popularized by athletes Tommie S mith and John Carlos at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City. For instance, upon meeting Black people in Berlin, he would raise his fist and arm, adding 'Attica!' i n reference to the prison revolt and the ensuing massacre in upstate New York in 1971. He would not have used the same gesture with 'white' comrades, he reminisced, because in those situations, it would have seemed too close to the party -communist salute. More generally, he and his friends adopted so much African American slang that, as he has it, 'one w ouldn't be able to understand our sentences today.' Instead of money ( Geld ), one spoke of 'bread,' instead of the government and the overall power structure, it was 'the man.' When he asked an African American friend about the fate of his girlfriend, the a nswer was, as he recollects, 'What the fuck, I don't know about my old lady,' and after that, everybody (that is, all the men) within his circle referred to thei r girlfriends, in German, as ' meine old lady ' [my old lady] (Kr\u00f6cher 2004). In that instance, by playfully stepping into a male African American speaker's role, he adopted a dismissive attitude towards women, and articulated an understanding of masculinity as emotionally detached, cool, and in charge. Such articulations of gender, and, implicitly, sexuality, resonated with popular images of African American men as unselfconscious, heroic, suave revolutionaries, as evidenced in various illustrations where guns and militancy lead to the proverbial upright walk. 'Blues' activists, and many other German s, often had problematically clear notions of what 'real' and authentic Black men, whom they so a pparently admired, were like, and they did not hesitate to apply the notion of 'Uncle To m' to those who did not meet their criteria. Intellectually, connectio ns between one's own position and African American experiences were made by means of parallels and analogies. Infamousl y, US yippie prankster Jerry Rubin had claimed that his long hair was like dark skin.12 People in the 11 For that reason, this scene's Afro -Americanophilia should be understood in the context of countercultural or subcultural style \u2014along the lines establ ished in classic analyses by Clarke (1975) and Hebdige (1979). That is, style figures as a structur e of signs which is actualized in a variety of diffe rent forms of expression, including language, music and clot hing, and, here, political attitude, rhetoric and ideals. Crucial semantic oppositions are derived from the re lation to Black American sources. 12 This quote circulated through various texts in the German counterculture, such as music writer Helmut Salzinger's Rock Power (1972: 169). Ege Becoming Black PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 11 West German scene, too, insisted tha t they experienced discrimination and were being 'treated like negroes' [sic] because of their long hair and hippie looks. As long -haired, working -class Berlin rebel Michael 'Bommi' Baumann, the most well -known member of the 'Blues,' wrote in his early mem oir, they got kicked out of bars or were spat upon in the streets, and employers discriminated against them. The dis tinction between chosen and racially ascribed markers of difference (long hair versus 'black' skin) seems obvious, as critics were quick to point out. Nonetheless, conflating them provided a subjective basis for claiming an oppressed perspective that, in the view of people like Baumann, necessarily led to a deeper understanding of African America n culture and politics. However, the verbal art iculation of one's own supposed minority status was ultimately less important to one's sense of empathy than the vague but nonetheless powerful notion of 'feeling.' 'Feeling,' of course, was closely t ied to music and the experience of listening to it, prod ucing it, dancing to it and having sex while listening to it. Music provided a form of experiential congruence between Black culture, or what people saw as such, on the one hand, and their sense of self and worl d on the other. A striking example can be fou nd in Baumann's memoir How it all began . Baumann affectionately remembers his 1950s childhood: Ich kann mich zum Beispiel erinnern, da hab ich im Be Musik geh\u00f6rt und wie Checkers 'Let's Twist again' example, I r emember I was lying in bed and I would always listen to Radio Luxemburg, at night, when you didn't come out of your room again, then you would always listen to music at night, and when I heard Chubby Checker's 'Let's Twist Again' for the f irst time, I got out of bed and danced the twist and I danced it in exactly the way in whi ch I saw it later, that is, I intuitively understood it in the correct way, what the man meant. For instanc e, in Cleaver's Soul on Ice , the chapter 'reconvalescence,' that captures it , that fits. Intuitively, I experienced it the way it wa s meant, that is, I got feeling .] However anecdotal it might be, this claim to immediate empathy t hrough a cultural product, by way of physical intuition, touches on nothing less than the narr ator's sense of self, and his sense of difference from his own surroundings, to which it lends both cultural thickness (musically, physically) and a metaphoric frame.13 For people such as 13 In the relevant chapter, Cleaver also speaks of white youth dancing to C hubby Checker, which makes it plausible to speculate that Baumann's memory was, as it were, creatively enhanced by the text. This, however, only confirms the relevance of Soul on Ice (Cleaver 1968), which apparently strengthened his wish to take on the position of the 'white negro.' Ege Becoming Black PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 12 Baumann, African American politics could be such an important refere nce poin t partly because they rested on identifications that had already been formed i n the process of socialization through popular culture and everyday life in Allied -occupied West Germany.14 From then on, those politics provided a metaphor for both difference a nd for belonging, a metaphor that intimately connected politics and subject ivity. 'Feeling,' as Baumann (1980) has it, refers to a mode of intuition a nd empathy that guides the self into cultural forms outside of its given horizon of a utochthonous traditi ons. The term implies a mode of experience that cannot really be ver balized. Furthermore, 'feeling' implicitly also serves as an argument aga inst conspicuously cerebral factions of the left and, in Baumann's view, their overly intellectual modes of apprehe nding the world: As working -class people, Baumann insists, he and his friends had never been as alienated from their bodies as their middle -class contemporaries, which made 'earthy' aspects of life such as sex and dancing, come to them much more naturally, just as they did to the African American world (1980: 16). Within the 'Blues,' the valorization of 'feeling' was embedded in c ulture -revolutionary ideals of leading one's life, of Lebensf\u00fchrung . Overall, there is a holistic character to the countercultu ral protagonists' Afro -Americanophilia, or at least to their own interpretation thereof. Moreover, when it came to questioning the boundari es between the political, the aesthetic, and the mundane world of everyday existenc e, countercultural subjects tended to sense a cognate, lived utopia in the African American world in general and among the Black Panthers more specifically. Cr ucially, for instance, popular arts and politics did not seem entirely different iated sub -systems of society in Black America, but rather, the sub -systems that differentiate in modern societies seemed to have merged again, or never to have been separat ed in the first place. In the African American world, political activism and organizing w ere an immediate expression of a popular, orga nic community in the state of collective revolt \u2014or, anyway, that is how the situation could be read with at least some plausibility, especially when contrasted to the overall alienation between left -wing radicals and the majority of the West German populat ion, including the working class. 14 There were, to be sure, other international and ethnical ly marked elements within the subcultural aesthetics of the Blues: from South America, most promin ently, from th e adherents of US hippie culture who themselves exhibited a plethora of ethnic, partl y primitivist predilections. The general hybridity of cultural expressions should also be kept in mind here: the Black Panther Party's iconic symbol, the beret, after all came from France. Ege Becoming Black PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 13 Many white German leftists, men and women alike, conceived of int er-racial sexual relations as a form of practical anti -racism.15 In terms of the binaries that structure cultural semantics, blackness had, at least since the romantic era, been associated with physicality and unrestrained sexuality. During German colonialism, aft er World War I, during the Nazi regime and in its aftermath, Black male sexuali ty was figured as a threat to national purity, and interracial sexualit y as 'racial disgrace.' During the US occupation, the stance had softened, but the basic cultural logics and bi naries had remained intact, even if they were re -evaluated. Sometimes, in particular among those who wanted to rid themselves of traditional cons traints, Black people were taken to embody one's personal sexual liberation. One of the crudest testame nts of a well - intended, yet deeply racist, sexualization of Blacks within the soci al world of the 'Blues' could be found on a sticker distributed by an a d-hoc group named 'Frauenbefreiungsfront Valerie Solanas' gut und auch die verm\u00f6beln / Und dann noch ist prima Internationalismus hurra!' [The Negro is good at screwing / and at beating up the pigs / and furthermore the Negro / is great a t making bombs / hurray for internationalism!] Here, countercultural and feminist s ensibilities pr oved very much in tune with mainstream representations, even though, in the protagonis ts' own view, they brought to the surface and transvalorised what was otherwi se repressed. We might speculate that they considered this over -the-top stereotyping to be su bversive of cultural norms.16 'Black Bars' in Germany, which had emerged during post -war occupation, were the primary spatial sites for sexual encounters, similar to the 'i nterzones' in Kevin Mumford's history of sex districts in the early -20th century US A. Occasionally, 'Blues' activists would venture there, as is represented in Die Gl\u00fccklichen (The Happy Ones, 1979), a picaresque novel cum memoir written by Peter Paul hier?' [Many Panthers here?], the protagonists, 'Blues' activists, ask an African American 15 This is discussed in greater detail in Ege (2007: ch. 3). El dridge Cleaver's theories of race and sex in Soul on Ice (1968) resonate with those of many countercultural whi tes. It must be stressed that because African American soldiers r epresented such an important and numerous group, there were many more Black men than women in the country. Hence, it was e asier for white heterosexual women (and white gay men) to find Black partners than it was for white he terosexual men (and white lesbia n women). Moral panics about this constellation occurred at various points after Wor ld Wars I and II. 16 On the importance of interracial sex in German 1970s femi nist texts, see Broeck (2007; 2010).

Ich auch' [ No, not many, just sympathizers like myself], the man says in slightly broken German ( Zahl 1979: 146). Night clubs such as the International, which were predominantly frequented by Black men, most of them temporary residents in the country, and by white German women, existed in many German (and other European) cities, and also in smal ler towns with US army bas es.17 In the following excerpt from Zahl's book, the nightclub serves as a meeting point where GI underground activists are attempting to contact a potential African American deserter whom they plan to smuggle to Scandinavia. But for the 'Blues' protagonist s, the club also provides exposure to a predominantly Black environment.

Zahl 's narrators are filled with fascination, an enjoyment of somethi ng 'other' and with sympathy far beyond the necessities of the political. At the same time, the protagonists aren't primarily engaged in an exoticist excursion. Rather , as this passage also i llustrates, their experience is embedded in a tangible political pr oject, namely aiding desertion. In this case, the two approaches are not mutually exclusive, but mutually constitutive. 18 Schlager (literally 'hit') refers to a category of low -brow German popular music that the protagonists would most likely consider corny. Ege Becoming Black PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 16 What is more, the author also makes sure to include dialogical ref lections on 'positive racism,' ultimately dismissing the charge that racist projecti ons form the basis of their fascination with Black Americans.19 Such charges, the ensuing dialogue shows, crumble in the face of actual experience and activism. The scene at t he 'International' seems to confirm that African American worlds are, indeed, different and have more ' pep' than the ones the activists have been exposed to, and ethical debates over e xoticism, the narrative suggests, prove irrelevant in this practical situ ation. Indeed, the protagonists and their African American acquaintances share a mutual ideological universe of left, anti-racist anti -capitalism, the contiguity of which is assured when they discuss Jam es Brown: his music is good, they agree, but the man is a 'pig,' and 'pigs aren't always pink.' Those who are pink, we may conclude, are not always 'pigs,' eithe r.20 IV. There seemed to be a clear -cut alliance, then, between countercultural sensibilities and contemporary African American expressions. One mi ght further argue that 'feeling,' meaning a type of relation toward music, dancing and sexuality, also point s toward a mode of sociality, a projected ideal of intuitively harmonious rela tions between partners, between, more broadly speaking, the individual and the group. However, when it came to contemporary Black popular music, things w ere more complicated, and these complications reveal further aspects of Wes t Germans' relationship to the African American world at this historical m oment. While they were enthralled by much Black culture and Black politics, many within the counterculture, for instance, felt ambivalent about soul music, as another interview ee, a former friend of 19 In the narrative, before the nightclub scene, the protagoni sts discuss the problematics of 'posit ive racism,' which some members of the group criticize stron gly. Nonetheless, after that visit, 'positive racism' appears to be a mostly academic problem. In tal king to Jeff, the issue comes up again. 'Ihr mogt sswarze \"Rassism?\"' [No more or less than others.

Habt ihr Papier have the papers?] Ilona, the 'positive racist,' is proven right in the scene, so she can ask, later on: ' Na, habe ich Recht gehabt, was racist ? Yes, you were.] (Zahl 1979: 145). 20 The narrator also terms James Brown a 'schwarze Sau, wie sie im Buche ideologue, Uncle Tom]. The concern is not limited to this narrative, either. In Berlin, a small demonstration against James Brown w as held outside a concert, mostly because of his appearance on TV on behalf of President Nixon, calling for o rder at a time of urban riots. 'Pigs aren't always pink,' is what the flyer, di stributed by white 'countercultural' sympathizers of the Black Panther Party and some Afric an American GIs, said. Ege Becoming Black PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 17 the aforementioned Baumann, explains. The music was captivating enough, he recal ls, but it obviously had a pop, rather than 'earthy' blues and hippie rock, se nsibility about it: 'Also ich hab' auf [Well, I didn't really dig soul music ... because these guys did so much dressing -up. They all had such a nice bourgeois character. I mean, most of us were into t he music, but not so much into the appearance of these guys \u2014after all, they all were up on stage in frilly shirts, dancing in lockstep!] (Reinders 2004). As such statements indicate, in m ale- dominated countercultural and 'music expert' circles, soul (One may also wonder whether dancing to soul music required a physical ease that many either did not want or possess, or did not like to be seen not possessi ng.) This dislike also surfaced in many record reviews that emerged f rom the countercultural sensibility. In such reviews, the prevailing semantics are strongl y linked to the aesth etic tradition of 1920s primitivism. In US discourse, terms from a diff erent semantic frame of appreciation abound, with many adjectives such as 'refined,' 'sm ooth' or 'easy,' which connote a particular modernity, as opposed to 'unpolished' blues and roc k music (see, for instance, Keil 1966). Such words, however, are hard to f ind in the German rock and pop music press. Rather, in a left -leaning, generally countercultural magazine such as Sounds , we find positively -weighted adjectives like 'earthy' [ erdig ], 'vital' [ vital], 'physical' [ physisch ], as well as negative terms like 'without juice and force' [saft- time and again, 'sterile' [ steril ]. These contrasting vocabularies of appreciation and condemnation document the reviewers' cultural criticism: According to their logic, bad records were based on commercial calculations whe reby artists anticipated a mass market's prejudices, and hence let go of their uncensored, unfiltered, authentic expression \u2014their unfiltered expression of Blackness, we might add, which to thes e critics had a lot to do with 'letting go.' While the mass mar ket may have wanted smoothed -out, watered -down, and ultimately 'whitened' Black music, counter -cultural and anti -capitalist reviewers let us know they wanted the real thing in unc ommodified Ege Becoming Black PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 18 form. In this semiotic model, 'authentic' Black figures as soul ful, deep, emotional, communal, sensual, authentic; whereas the commercial world (incl uding that which is 'inauthentically' black) figures as white, shallow, rational, indi vidualistic, alienated and calculated.21 However, this was not only a rather na\u00efve appro ach to how popular music is produced, and a rather limited definition of African American musical modernism, it also had the effect of producing a 'pop' audience as 'other,' and genderi ng it as female. At this point in the argument, it is important to lo cate the countercultural perspective within the cultural field. Soul certainly was not an underground phenomenon. The famous Atlantic Records compilation That Is Soul (Volume 1), sold about 120,000 copies in Germany in 1968. According to one contemporary e stimate, more than ten percent of all record purchases in Germany at the time consisted of soul music. Moreover, at the level of cultural significance and contemporaneity --pop culture's famous sense of 'now' --soul had become, as German lifestyle magazine twen put it in February 1968, 'the music that everybody knows everything about,' the music tha t was 'rotating on all progressive turntables' ( Bourbon 1968: 136). Here, too, Blackness was a relevant category, as, among other things, the rather fetishistic vi sual depictions of soul musicians in twen illustrate. In that sense, an overall Afro -Americanophile sentiment was prevalent within large segments of the younger generation. At the time, aside from 'holisti c' practices of enhanced Afro -Americanophilia wit hin highly politicized and countercultural circles, there was also a developing pop culture --transported mainly via music and visual culture --that prominently featured Black glamour. Here, too, people dreamt of sexual and physical liberation, engaged in ex oticist projections and reproduced binaries that they claimed to transcend, and in some ways widened their horizons. H ere, too, some whites fantasized about being black. On the dancefloor and beyond, many tr ansformed their styles of movement, and, in terms of their physicality, moved further away from the older German nationalist ideal of brisk, disciplined movement, Zackigkeit [snappiness] (Maase 1996). Most often, however, they did so without coming to any cultural -revolutionary conclusions. 21 This is not to uncritically deny the effects of the profit -oriented recording industry and of racist practices within it. But the blinders of the countercultural view are apparent. Such critics miss much of what is characteristic about the music, and universa lize their own cultural codes (Guillory & Green 1998; Ege 2007: 46ff). Ege Becoming Black PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 19 This lower d egree of cultural meaningfulness and coherence marks 'mainstream' Afro - Americanophilia as an aspect of (post -)modern consumer culture. The pleasure of seeing images and listening to sounds marked as 'other' \u2014racialized exoticism \u2014was being democratized, in c ontrast to such earlier elite phenomena as 18th century aristocratic Chinoiserie. These practices of appropriation also be longed to the realm of the everyday, as opposed to more traditional racialized carnival prac tices like 'blacking up.' The (white) self , rather than being conceived of as a rigidly bound entity concerned with purity and authenticity, functioned as a flexible consumer of d ifference.22 Certainly, these popular forms of Afro -Americanophilia \u2014and we must use the term in a much looser sense he re\u2014could also encompass anti -racist gestures and beliefs. The Civil Rights movement, and conservatives' polemics against both Black music and (formal) racial equality, infused musical enjoyment with an et hical tone, even though the mode of engagement here was characterized by less commitment to a political project or to a holistic way of subcultural life than elsewhere. However, countercultural and anti -racist critics were right to point out that the logic of consumption and commodification remained linked to processes of exploitation --in material and symbolic terms.23 At the micro -political level of movements, gestures and sensations, however, 'mainstream' Afro -Americanophilia did contribute to subtle forms of cultural change, and it did so outside of dissid ent urban scenes as well; changes to the way in which young Germans of the post -fascist generation felt about, moved and inhabited their bodies; changes to where their cultural imaginaries ended; cha nges to how they conceived the boundaries between self an d other. The political character of these processes became apparent in dif ferent ways, consciously or subconsciously. In a long feature article, teen magazine BRAVO spelled out the popular 'white' German passion for soul music, using a strangel y inapprop riate 22 It might be tempting to present a clear -cut dichotomy between a holistic model of solidarity, commitment and risk -taking on the one hand, and a more popular, less com mitted model that, through commodification and consumption, reproduces rac ism, on the other. However, solidarity workers weren't disconnected from pop cultural imaginaries and, in their cultural cri ticism, sometimes held on to racialized imagery that would have been too explicit for much of the pop cultural world. 23 This argumen t is developed further in Ege (2007), where I discus s Charles Wilp's 'Afri Cola' advertising campaigns. Classic arguments against the 'consum ption of difference' (as forms of 'incorporation,' of 'eating the other') have been made by h ooks (1992) and others . German -American New Left theorist Herbert Marcuse (1969) termed pheno mena like the so -called 'sex wave' in the mid - 1960s, which pre -dated 'sexual liberation,' a form of 'repressive desublimation.' I n the German discussion, the racial aspect of these sexu al imaginaries has been widely neglected, even though interracial sex plays a very significant role in crucial textua l and visual representations of the time. Ege Becoming Black PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 20 metaphor: 'H\u00e4tte man, Soul lebt man' [If a DJ in a dance club had the strange idea of not playing soul records, he would most likely get himself lynched ... Germany's teens are soul -crazed. At least at night in the night clubs. Why? One feels soul, one dances soul, on e lives soul.] ( BRAVO 12 February 1968: 16).24 Critics soon began to raise the question of who exactly this 'one' was, the 'one' who felt, danced, and lived soul: Could it be a white person? And what would that im ply? Despite its pop aspect, and unlike ma ny earlier Black or Black -inspired musical genres, especially Rhythm -and-Blues -derived 'beat' music, soul was difficult to read as anything but explicitly Black music, based on specific experiences and entangled in complex ways with contemporaneous African American struggles in the context of Civil Rights, Black Power, and the postcolonial scene internationally. This is how it was decoded by German critics. For instance, another article in twen , from December 1968, which was accompanied by page after page o f photographs of Black people, stresses the notion of racial exclusivity: ' Die R\u00fcc kbesinnung auf die Urspr\u00fcnge, auf die schwarze Seele Wei\u00dfe .' [The return to the origins, to the black soul of jazz, the re treat into emotional content and toward forms of expression that seem inaccessible to whites are all derived from a pursuit of exclusivity, a non -imitability. They mean: off limits for 1968: The 'off limits' issue may not have been recogniz ed by every listener, but it did have practical aspects: in not being able to buy many of the records one had heard about, not really speaking the language, not quite getting the re ferences, not knowing how to dance in just the right way. On a more discursive leve l, of course, the problem was categorical: If 's oul' referred to an essence of blackness, that essence might be completely inaccessible to whites. For that reason, cont emporary critics often pointed out what they saw as an irony composed of the ethno -racial essentialism of soul music on the one hand, an d its very popularity, its commercial, culture -industrial form 24 Other references are provided in Ege (2007: 46 -78). Ege Becoming Black PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 21 on the other hand.25 And while there was an abundance of rock 'n' roll, 'beat' and neo - blues bands throughout the 1960s in Germany, there were initially very few bands that tried their luck as ' soul' bands. Covers of U.S. soul hits recorded by mainstream Schlager stars mostly failed, both commercially as well as critic ally.26 V. Returning to the question of a broader pattern that runs through various forms of German Afro -Americanophilia in the l ate 1960s, these dynamics of exclusion, accessibility and inclusion are crucial. In this respect, the si tuation in the field of popular music was reminiscent of the situation in radical politics. In the latter, white German activists often went to consider able lengths to seek acceptance from Black Power activists, as the episode from the Berlin nightclub shows. S ome sources drastically document such desires: 'Black GIs!,' read an English -language flyer distributed outside a Mannheim army barracks by German SDS students: We know there was a conclusion of black -power -leaders not to join any action organized by whities [sic]. But the part of German youth sympathiz ing with black power is much more radical as [sic] those at home in the States. We want to contac t black men, friends or members of black power, that are ready to discuss and work with us. Here, the intent to cooperate specifically and exclusively with African Americans \u2014 African American men\u2014coincided with a desire to be recognized and accepted despit e one's white skin. Appropriating a pejorative term from African Am erican usage ('whities'), the authors of the flier apparently did not consider themselves white in the same sense as 'whities' in the United States, and in seeking Zusammenarbeit (cooperati on), they were asking for confirmation of that self -image.27 In widely disseminated cultural texts like those I discussed from BRAVO and twen , African Americans stressed the irreducible difference inherent in their culture, experience, and political ident ity. In the field of music, the book Blues People by Amiri Baraka (LeRoi Jones) \u2014translated into German in 1969 \u2014presents one such argument.28 25 Intellectually, Adorno's critique of ja zz as phony escapism from the cultural patterns of capi talist modernity seemed to provide the backdrop for such ar guments. 26 See, for example. the CD compilation Soul in Germany (2007), which features German -language songs by the Temptations, The Supremes, Marvin Gaye, Dionne Warwick, and German -language soul covers by Schlager singers, such as Jacob Sisters, Manuela, Gilla, and Michae l Holm. 27 Young Germans' contradictory relation to national guilt ( in relation to World War II, the holocaust and anti-Semi tism) and a more general Western 'white' guilt (in relation to colonialism, slavery and imperialism) is discussed in Ege (2007: 140ff). 28 This is discussed in Andrew Hurley's and Detlef Siegfried' s essays in this journal issue. The book was Ege Becoming Black PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 22 In the Black Power movement, a very similar pattern surfaced in the rejection of direct cooperation with white sympa thizers (which, from a sympathetic viewpoint, could be termed as self -reliance and self -organization). In discourses on sexuality, prominent African Americans stressed the attractiveness and beauty of other Black people, in opposition to the traditional pr estige attributed to white (especially female) partners. In popular music, a similar pattern could be seen in the exclusiveness of soul and the general consensus about the impossibility of a white person's 'Black' voi ce. However, in all these fields, sym bolic exclusion only seemed to drive white attempts to gain membership and acceptance.29 There were different strategies for reacting to this sense of exclusion, and in contrast to the USA, fewer African Ame ricans were present to comment on them critically or intervene. Disarming irony represented one such path, which was applied to band names and song titles (the Average White Ba nd from Scotland comes to mind), caricatures and wisecracks (such as the term schwarzsingen ['blacksinging']). And, of course, the re were also serious intellectual arguments, especially within the context of radical politics, where Black na tionalism was dismissed as 'petty -bourgeois' and counter -revolutionary.30 Crucially, however, in settings where the textual, discursive mode of engagement did not take centre stage, the primary strategy for coping with the tendenc y toward racial exclusiveness in African American culture and politics consisted i n relying on the evidence of experience and performance: Once one got the 'feeling' right , symbolic exclusion was replaced by imaginary belonging. For instance, in record reviews, articles, memoirs, and other narratives, there are vivid descriptions of imm ersion experiences, of temporary instances of communitas that take place in nightclubs, a t concerts, or during travels. In such narratives, when one showed one's enthusiasm in the right manner, as a review of an Aretha Franklin concert in Frankfurt, attended mostly by African American GIs, put it, when one was ready to show that one was part of the 'magical circle of the enthusiasts' and not some arrogant outsider, when one joi ned in the call - translated into German in 1969 after having been translated by a 'student c ollective,' which included Werner Sollors, who came to chair Harvard University 's department of African American Studies at a later stage of his career. 29 To be sure, the awareness of this predic ament was unevenly developed. Those who merely felt enthused by Afri -Cola's advertisements, danced to soul music or, mayb e, fantasized about sex with a Black partner most likely knew nothing about the arg uments made by Baraka and probably wouldn't have cared either way. 30 This case was made, for instance, in the introduction to th e German translation of Baraka's (then Leroi Jones) Blues People (1969), written by the aforementioned 'Berlin student col lective'. Ege Becoming Black PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 23 and-response communication, 'then one is accepted' ( twen October 1968: 140). Whilst, then, there may have been rejection at the level of content, inclusio n was simultaneously enacted at the level of performance, and this fulfi lled a deep -seated white desire. Sex, of course, was another form of togetherness tha t could be made to stand for a transgression of such boundaries. VI In this paper, I took a close look at forms, practices, patterns and \u2014to some extent \u2014the politics of Afro -Americanophilia in West Germany between 1967 and 1975. In doing so, going into detail was important, not so as to deduce cultural meanings and dynamics from pre -given assumptions a nd normative viewpoints, but, in the space permitted, to reconstruct them from the ground up. What, then, did this wave of Afro - Americanophilia, at that cultural moment, mean for the history of racism in Germany, and what other larger -scale cultural and so cial processes were connected with it? Quite different things have been labelled here as instances of Af ro-Americanophilia. Given an object of study so heterogeneous, we must avoid fallacious reif ications and generalizations. Still, scientific surveys an d personal accounts by Black Germans document that Germany, on the whole, did not suddenly become a less racist place toward people of African descent. Certainly, as illustrated in Donna Summer's case, some Blacks were able to manoeuvre through Germany in ways that straightforward anti-Black racism would have made less likely or even impossible.31 In some cases, more thoughtful forms of anti -racist practice took hold, and racial categories were re - thought. Solidarity work was real enough, and it inspired ser ious debates. However, overall, racism was not challenged, nor was the presumption of Ger many's generic whiteness really questioned. Rather, white rebels and consumers ali ke empowered themselves to live out their racialized fantasies, and constraine d Black s to very specific roles \u2014instrumentalizing them, defining their supposed essence, making them subservient, even while putting them on pedestals. The Manichean worldvi ew of 31 Illuminating Black people's experiences with Afro -Americanophilia is an important task that could not be accomplished in this paper. Notes on the post -WW II era can be found in Partridge 2008 (where, for example, Hans -J\u00fcrgen Massaquoi's memories of exoticist erotic interes t in the 1950s are cited and interpreted); see also the articles by Ege and Hurley in this issue of PORTAL and the comment by Huber in Footnote 6. Baum et al. (1992 [1986]) give insights into their exper iences with 'white' projections and desires toward Afro -German women like themselves, highlighting occasional moments of empowerment, but mostly the alienating effects of ambiguous compliments and intrusive questions. However, this concerns a slightly later time, the early and mid -1980s, wh en the 'alternative' [alternative] and '\u00d6ko' [eco-activist] milieus had grown. Ege Becoming Black PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 24 modern primitivism, in which Blacks and Whites were taken to embody e ssentially different, complementary principles (most basically, intellectualit y versus emotionality and physicality), structured the stereotypes of Black America that were widespread among white German Afro -Americanophiles, and motivated many of them. Certainly, these lo gics did become modified and questioned, and new imaginations of cultural - political equivalence emerged.32 More often than not, however, the celebration of a cultural subconsciousness, of the formerly repressed (such as ideas about Black sexuality), remaine d within the parameters of a racialized semantics. Metaphor and equivalence are crucial concepts for understanding 1960s Afro - Americanophilia as symbolic practice. In popular culture, among white s, 'feeling black' and 'becoming black' were tropes and wid e-spread fantasies. When countercultural activists claimed to have been treated 'like Blacks,' and creat ed chains of equivalence between their own life and that of African Americans, they took suc h tropes the furthest. For countercultural subjects, Blackne ss provided a metaphorical frame for imagining and, in a largely imaginary way, experiencing difference from the conse rvative cultural and political norms they rejected, which was not only a cognitive, but a lso an affective and corporeal matter. Of course, in terms of actual social position and experience of oppression, these claims of equivalence were grossly inaccurate. A dditionally, the difference between dynamics of German guilt after the Holocaust and white guilt in the United States led to curious dis placements. In many ways, though, at the time, at least within cultural revolutionary thought and practice, realism was suspe nded anyway: exhuberance, fantasy, myth were seen to be more than merely misr ecognitions of reality, as Jerry Rubin wrote, and Germ an counterculturals soon translated: 'Marx ist ein Mythos. Mao ist ein Die Panther sind aus ihnen heraus' [Marx is a myth. Mao is a myth. The Black Panthers ar e a myth. People try to live up to the myth, it helps them be the best they can ] in Fizz No. 3, 1971, unpaginated).33 32 Within the context of Afro -Americanophilia, for instance, people began reading authors such as Frantz Fanon. Furthermore, there are, of course, many more c omplex and more inte resting models of African American popular aesthetics, some of which also circu lated at the time within smaller circles of enthusiasts. Historian George Lipsitz's (1994) suggestions focus on Black popular aesthetics as articulating a contradictory, rather than primitivist, positionality half within, half external to Wes tern modernity and the displacements of modern capitalism. See also the discussion in Ege (2007: 154 -164). Generally, at the time, practices (listening to musi c, dancing, connecting in variou s forms) may have been ahead \u2014in the sense of more complex, less stereotypical \u2014of the rhetoric that tried to explicate them. 33 My translation. Ege Becoming Black PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 25 British cultural critic Kobena Mercer observed that around 1968, in t he USA and in the UK, but also on a global scale, the predominantly w hite counter culture and Black liberation movements were united by a common goal 'to decolonize inherite d models of subjectivity' (1994: 304). Of course, this meant quite different things under very different circumstances, but there also were significant alliances, crossovers and resonances. Playful, empathetic and, one may argue, ethically and politically ir responsible approaches to personal and collective identity were hotly debated at the time, particularly in Germany. In the realm of social theory, n ew processes of subject formation were discussed, for instance, in Herbert Marcuse's opti mistic diagnosis of a 'new sensibility,' which took experimental forms of life and subje ctivity as a prefiguration of post -revolutionary times, or, in quite a differen t way, in J\u00fcrgen Habermas's charge against 'irrational' and 'romantic' tendencies within the student movement and their 'emotional identifications' with subaltern groups, inc luding the Vietcong and the Black Panther Party. Significantly, German SDS spokesm an and psychoanalyst Reimut Reiche (1968), reflecting the mood of large parts of his constituency, defended such identifications, stressing the lack of cre dible objects of young people's left -wing identification in post -fascist Germany. Furthermore, very much in line with Marcuse, he designated such practices as a testi ng ground for 'a new form of psychological relation to one's surroundings' in which emotions and the imagination were to play a bigger role. In a different theoretical language, French radi cal theorists Gilles Deleuze and F\u00e9lix Guattari argued at the time that hegemonic forms of subjectivity ne eded to be and were being overcome. They viewed the 'becoming -minor' of dominant groups as an integral and necessary part thereof, that is the forming 'blocs of becoming' with subaltern movements, hoping that such processes would blur the line between what was considered one's own and what was alien and 'other' (1987 [1980]: 291 -298).34 In their view, affect, movement, gestures, quantums of energy, rhyth m and pace are where 'molecular' processes of sociocultural change take place. In that sense, the enjoyment, appropriation and imitation of practices based in African Americ an culture were indeed 34 On the concept of a 'bloc of becoming' (and its shortcomin gs) see Ege (2007: 147 -153). The authors explicitly to ok 'becoming black,' drawing partly on Amiri Baraka's work, and quipped that, according to the Black Panthers, even blacks had to become Black, or ' minoritarian' in an emphatic sense. Ege Becoming Black PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 26 part of a process of change on this 'molecular' level, which Deleuze and Guattari opposed to the 'molar' level of institutional and movement politics, a nd was where they put their hopes for the emergence of new 'blocs of becoming.' This mole cular level encompasses the history of lived corporeality and imagined selv es which, in complex and non -linear ways, feed back into representations of the body politic. Some of my findings correspond to such arguments: There is indeed no clea r line between political solidarity and the realm of the imagination. Poli tical passion s sometimes derive from popular cultural sensibilities and exoticist fantasies, or from a desire to leave behind one's whiteness, one's world -historical guilt, Nazi associations, or one's German provinciality. Despite such entanglements, they ca n produce t angible results. Connections are made, people find 'lines of flight.' What happens on a molecular level is irreducible to racial attributions or politic al discourse. Of course, actual practices in many ways lagged behind utopian expectations, whether they were focussed on anti -imperialist solidarity or on a -subjective, molecular forms of becoming. The awareness of the problem of exoticism, for instance, remaine d limited, partly because of irrationalism. The politics of appropriation could not so ea sily be disentangled from structures of inequality, from the politics of r ace, gender, and sexuality. And, crucially, the de -contextualization and commodification of specific elements of African American cultural production, such as music, contributed to their integration into conventional, if updated, modes of (mainly white, German) subjectivity. Here, Deleuze and Guattari's disinterest in reflecting conventiona l power relations, and their enthusiasm for processes of becoming and movement below the level of discurs ive representations, are very much a reflection of their times; on the level of sophisticated theory, they speak to a desire for communitas that the counterculturals exhibited on the level of practice. In retrospect and leaving ethical questions to one si de, something which seemed like liberation to many appears to many critics like a mere episode in processes of modernization and individualization. As historian Detlef Siegfried writes in his study on youth, protest and consumer culture in 1950s and 1960s West Germany (2006), racial masquerades, and other experiments with identity, started as sub - and countercultural practice, and then became integrated into the cultural industries , where they contributed to an overall de -homogenization of life styles, to i nformalization (Norbert Elias, Cas Ege Becoming Black PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 27 Wouters) and to a 'pluralization of the spectrum of norms,' which w as, ironically, much more consonant with the emerging post -Fordist social order. On that reading, and in stark contrast to the intentions of many protagon ists, late 1960s Afro -Americanophilia, in concert with other forms of exoticism, contributed significantly to the modernization of consumer capitalism with its aestheticized modes of experienc e, less rigid national boundaries, and more fluid, performative identities and identifications. Convincing as such sweeping historical narratives are, in trying to do justice to the complexity of cultural practice, I believe it is important to also remember the contradictory nature of 1960s and 1970s Afro -Americanophil ia and allow for a more ambiguous conclusion.

PORTAL is published under the auspices of UTSePress, Sydney, (1968-2005) Moritz Ege, University of Munich Andrew Wright Hurley, University of Technology Sydney This essay continues our thinking through of the implications of scholarship on what we have called 'Afro-Americanophilia' in twentieth century Germany. We set out our reasons for using this term in the introduction to this special edi tion; however it is worth stressing again here that the term is intended to designate the A frican- American - centredness of German interest in black culture, as opposed to the m ore generically 'African' that Negrophilia connotes, a term which is also often l inked with a very specific phase in European culture, the 1920s.1 Especially in the wake of technologies like the jukebox, radio, film and television, and after defeat and Allied occupation in WWII, there has been a distinct German engagement with African A merican culture(s).2 Our term includes a deliberate juxtaposition (Black Power prefix; Greek suffix), which is intended to prompt attention to the tensions and ambiguities running thr ough the 'love.' It is important to conceive of the complexity and implications of this love. In the 1 As in our previous joint essay, the culturally constructed yet c rucial categories 'black' and 'white' will not be put in quotation marks or begin with a capital letter on the f ollowing pages (unless there is a context of identity politics and emphatic cultura l pride among protagonists), but they should nonetheless be read as highly debated, unstable signifiers (with real -world references and effects in experiences, identities and politics), not as 'neutral', sociological den ominations. 2 There are, of course, counterexamples, including the prominent novelist and ethn ographer Hubert Fichte (1935 -1986) whose works on African diasporic cultures and gay/queer sexuality sp ans the Black Atlantic, and the Africanist Janheinz Jahn (1918 -1973) who, a few decades earlier , wrote on numerous African but sometimes also African American literatures, and colla borated with L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Periodizing and Historicizing 2 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 2 hands of a white majority, Afro -Americanophilia might be personally and culturally enabling, but it can also involve racist projections, and can impose r estrictive expectations on the people it supposedly loves. As we noted in our first survey essay and the introduction to the speci al issue, our objec tive here is to sketch out phases or eras in the German uptake of 'Black cultural traffic,' based largely on recent literature, in order to obtai n an overview of salient themes, distinctions, and political dynamics. We mean not to whitewa sh acts of Afro - Americanophilia, but neither to dismiss them out of hand. Rather we int end to enquire into the breadth, patterns and political implications and effects of specific instantiations of the Afro -Americanophilia theme. While this is again often a story of white German Afro -Americanophilia, the larger narratives also involves Afro -Americanophilia -Germans and Germans 'with a background in migration.' Having followed a timeframe from imperial Germany through to the post war in our first survey essay, her e we begin with the turning point of the late 1960s, encapsulated by the emblematic year, 1968, when German Afro -Americanophilia modulated and intensified, and we follow that forward to a point approaching the present day. In the process, we contemplate th e rise of interest in the Black Diaspora amongst the new social movements, second -wave feminism, and Afro -German activism in the 1980s. We also attend to important moments in the German reception and recontextuali zation of African -American coded popular mu sic such as disco, techno and hip -hop, following some of the resonances evident in music journalism, literary writi ng and academia. This is not to deny that similar (or divergent) patterns may have existe d in relation to Ernste Musik ['serious' or 'high' c ulture music], advertising, visual culture, film and literatur e. However, we have had to set some limits \u2014complexity seems to increase in contemporary history \u2014and we have thus focused most on the realms of popular music that are best known to us, and compar atively well covered in scholarly and/or popular literature. This essay also includes a discussion of the impact of migration, and the breakdown of previously unquestioned equivalences between Germanness and whiteness. In that context, we will point to the complex triangulation of desire that figured within the reception and appropriation of US rap music and hip -hop by diverse groups of young people in Germany in the context of cultural globalization. O verall, we argue that, in some respects, the contours o f Afro -Americanophilia shifted Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 2 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 3 considerably \u2014the subject positions diversified and, especially in the course of the 1980s, new dynamics emerged that seemed to leave behind the ideas of ra cial 'authenticity' that had dominated German Afro -Americanophilia for a long time (and continue to do so in some of contemporary versions). Our final objective for this essay is to return to the question of periodization that we raised in the introduction to this special edition, so as to query what a timeframe -based overvi ew can and cannot address; most importantly the question of structural continuities in pat terns of twentieth - century Afro -Americanophilia in Germany. We will plumb some of those continuitie s, and offer some conclusions on the usefulness of a periodization, notwithstanding. 1968 -1975: Counterculture, post -counterculture and the consequences of immigration In an essay on '1968,' British cultural critic Kobena Mercer (1992) i lluminates the global cultural role of the Black Power movement, and suggests that in the English - speaking world 'becoming black' was a collective white countercultural fantasy at this time. Such a pattern of fantasies also existed in Germany, and in some respects it marked a clear break in regard to earlier types of German Afr o-Americanop hilia. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, German understandings of blackness were constituted by a peculiar confluence of radical politics, sexual emancipation, and popular culture. In some prominent cases, the pre -existing, primitivistic semiotic pattern of mutual exclusivity or complementarity between white -German and black was supplemented by a new pattern of imaginary equivalence and calls for solidarity, as Moritz Ege identifies in his article in this special edition in greater detail. Other new fact ors were important. The volume of German -language writing about African Americans and Black Diasporic culture \u2014literature, politics and, to some extent, race and racism \u2014increased markedly, as young (white) scholars began to specialize in African American St udies, and German presses published translations of key works on Black Diasporic populations in the USA, Haiti, Jamaica and Brazi l.3 In such writing, academic research and contemporary cultural currents were closely intertwined. 3 Most of these scholars wrote within the 1968 context, however others approached the topic from different historiographical tradition s. For example, the (then) social -democratic historian Immanuel Geiss wrote books at this time on Pan -Africanism (1968) and African American history (1969). For bibliographies see: Ege (2007), H\u00f6hn and Klimke (2010, Boesenberg (2011), Ge rund (2013). Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 2 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 4 The new politics of affini ty and solidarity, which spanned different sociocultural fields between politics, literature and music, again diverged in the two German states. In the West, solidarity with the Black Power movement and its struggle a gainst the US 'power structure' was, li ke the larger -scale anti -Vietnam War movement, a form of protest against the West German government's close ally. In the East, t he government of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) did not embrace the Black Power movement as such; however its citizens wer e encouraged to protest against the USA in prescribed ways. Officially sanctioned protest was therefore directed aga inst the USA's treatment of some spokespeople of the Black Power movement, such as the philosopher a nd activist Angela Davis.4 This context made solidarity with the Black Power movement less attractive to some oppositionally minded East Germans. Afro -Americanophilia was not the only genre of racially inflected ' -philia' during the Sixties. In comparison with the more superficial 'exotica' fa d of the 1950s, large numbers of individuals now appropriated cultural materials and practice s from abroad -- literature, furniture, clothing, food or music --more consciously, and attempted to integrate those products, signifiers, movements and affects into r eformed ways of life, which they often understood in expressly political terms.5 The continuing role of particular racial imaginations and colonial histories in this new 1960s context is not well illuminated. But we can provisionally suggest that there was a tendency of wanting to supplement the 1950s novelty exoticism we outlined in our first survey ess ay (which self-described progressives or Alternative [alternatives] considered unsophisticated, consumerist and provincially German) with more earnest and w ide-reaching forms of appropriation. Appropriation was not so much about momentary Bereicherung (enrichment) through consumption, but implied a transformation of the Sel f\u2014at least, 4 Afte r the Marin county courthouse shooting Davis was lis ted on the FBI's Most Wanted list, leading to her arrest in 1970. Davis, who had studied in Frankfurt am Main (West Germany) and was a CPUSA member, became a household name in Germany. In the GDR , thousan ds of middle school children were encouraged to write postcards to Davis in prison. In the F RG, the New Left rallied to her support, culminating in the conference 'Am Beispiel Angela Davis' [Wi th Angela Davis as an Example], organized by Frankfurt School s cholar Oskar Negt, in 1972. After her release in 1972, East German State officials sought to share the stage with her on more than one occasi on, most famously at the Weltfestspiele der Jugend [World Festival of Youth] in East Berlin 1973 (H\u00f6hn & Kli mke 2010, ch. 7; Gerund 2013). 5 In this context, one could try to discern specific Germa n groups by their particular geographic and cultural orientations and their practices of longing and ap propriation. There were those who oriented themselves, more or less pragmatically, towards Italy, France, Spain, Denmark, Sweden, G reece, Great Britain, the USA generally, India, Palestine, Israel , South America, Morocco, or, in a different way, t o China, as in the 'Chinoiserie' of post -1968 Maoist groups. Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 2 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 5 this is how many people understood their own actions. Cultural commentators -- pessimists and optimists alike --regarded such patterns as a flight from historically tainted Germanness. This interpretation is plausible, overall, but the fact that similar processes were going on all over the world complicates the picture.6 Afro - Americ anophilia was one of many -philias, then, but it was distinct in a number of ways, particularly by virtue of its focus on the USA; that is, its all egiance with the 'other' side of the dominant Western world power, its strong articulation with popul ar cultu re, and its positioning in relation to the long -standing tradition of anti -black racism.7 These sociocultural processes are crucial for understanding the mindse t of many members of a generation that later was to dominate (West) Ge rman culture and, in the late 1990s, politics through the Green Party and self -described progressive Social Democrats. They must, however, also be understood in terms of their interdependence with (and disconnect from) the large -scale labour migration that began in the 1960s. Labo ur migrants came to West Germany from Southern Europe (Italy, Spain, Portugal Greece and Turkey) and also, to a smaller extent, from Tunisia a nd Morocco in North Africa. Small numbers also came from South Korea. Although the Gove rnment put a stop to active recruitment in 1973, this did not halt actual migration, especiall y from Turkey, as family members followed their relatives who had come e arlier. Immigration significantly and permanently changed the make -up of the country as well as the meanings of what Germanness may mean. In this context, there were new and re - warmed discourses about difference and alterity ( Fremdheit ), and such discourses touched on the African American world in various significant ways. F or example, when referring to recent immigrants ' living and working conditions the West German press used expressions like Die Neger Europas (Europe's negroes) and even 'N -----s.' Within the German contemporary imagination, the racial situation of the U SA supplied the paradigm of diversity and exploita tion in ethnically heterogeneous societies. However, these were problematic discursive framings and analogies, not least because few of the immigrants were actually racially marked as black. The political scientist and historian Karin Sch\u00f6nw\u00e4lder (2001, 2 004) has demonstrated that West German policy - 6 On the relatio nship of Anglophone hippies to Native Americans, for instance, see Stua rt Hall's contemporary analysis (1968). For an analysis of the long -standing German fascination with Native Americans, see Penny (2013). 7 On the latter, see Moritz Ege's article in thi s special issue discussing the distinct yet sometimes overlapping countercultural and popular modes of relation and appropriation. Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 2 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 6 makers strove that migrants would be (white) 'European' rather tha n African or Asian, and the State put Non -Europeans under greater pressure to leave the country after their work contracts expired .8 There was a n obvious, though not surprising contradiction between this ongoing structural exclusion of people of colour and the Afro - Americanophilia displayed in cultural quarters. However, despite re strictive labour migration policies, there were still more Black pe ople in Germany than there had been in the 1950s, and not just within US Army garrisons.9 Afro -Germans born shortly after the war came of age. A small number, like the soccer player Er win Kostedde and the actor G\u00fcnther Kaufmann, rose to fame in the late . Some African American soldiers stayed on, as did a few touring artists and othe r travelers, as well as students, migrants, and refugees from a number of African cou ntries. A Black German population was slowly growing --small in comparison to the population of Southern European immigrants --however it could hardly be called a group or community in the sociological sense, as there appears to have been little group consci ousness, institutions, or interpretive resources that enabled cohesion, and there were sti ll no prominent Black German spokespeople. On the contrary, many individuals seem to have felt the absence of community and a strong sense of isolation. This is not t o say that these individuals were without agency when confronted by racism, including unwanted Afro - Americanophilia in their social milieu.10 On the experience of Black Germans at the time, there are pertinent observations in various collections and es says, and further historical work is in progress (Oguntoye et al. post -counterculture and feminist Afro -Americanophilia Between th e fading -out of the student rebellion in the mid -1970s and reunification in 1989, cultural flows, appropriations and feedbacks become both more diffuse and complex. Musical culture and subcultural life worlds still formed dominant arenas of white Afro -Amer icanophilia, but the literary realm and left -wing, feminist and anti - racist politics were also crucial. However, it becomes harde r to pin down an overall 8 The argument was made without explicit reference to racial categories. Instead, policy makers and bureaucrats referred to Non-European 'culture' and potential problems of 'integr ation,' thus foreshadowing the turn toward a 'racism without races' to use Etienne Balibar's (1991) resonant term. 9 Precise numbers are hard to come by as race was a taboo sub ject for surveys. 10 This could also include leaving the country. On such 'imperce ptible politics' from a theoretical angle, see Papadopoulos, Stephenson and Tsianos (2008). Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 2 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 7 cultural theme during this ('postmodern') period, at a time when signs , genres and milieu s were divers ifying, hopes for radical emancipation were being disappointed (or ended via repression), new subject positions and identity politics struggl ed for recognition, and conservatives were elected to government, both in the USA and in Germany. At the same time, it is important to keep in mind some basics of social history at the time: living standards continued to improve for large numbers of people in both countries, which allowed them more power to consume, and increasingly ni che sensibilities. In the USA, the black middle class grew substantially, mostly outside of inner city areas, but poverty simultaneously took root, as inner city are as rapidly decayed and deindustrialization and drugs plagued poor communities, especial ly African American ones. In Germany , the left -wing alternative culture and the so -called new social movements of the 1970s and 1980s like feminism, the anti -NATO peace movement, Third World solidarity groups and the environmental movement, formed an important socio -political milieu that in many ways grew out of the radicalism of the late 1960s (Reichardt & Siegfried 2010; Reichardt 2014; and, in relation to Switzerland, Kuhn 2011) . Here, the African American world was not the central point of reference when it came to 'foreign' places of lon ging\u2014India, South America, and Native Americans may have been more significant \u2014but it was important (Ege 2010; Penny 2013). While white Germans formed the great majority within these scenes, participants ca me from various backgrounds. These milieus contain ed diverse left -wing migrants (Greeks, Italians, Turks, Kurdish Turks, Iranians and others), who possessed different political orientations. The milieu s also included a few African -American US army deserters and Black Panther sympathizers, albeit in small numbers (Bojadzijev & Perinelli 2010: 144). If ways of life in Germany were partly liberalized and democra tized at this time, as cultural historians like Detlef Siegfried (2006) argue, then it wa s partly the doing of these diverse milieux as well, and it d id not happen without resistance.11 Nonetheless, white -Germanness and its 'interior' libidinal economies remained dominant within the new social movements, as the example of second -wave f eminism 11 Bojadzijev and Perinelli (2010) reminds us that even with in the German context, cultural appropriation by 'normative' German subjects was by no means the whole story ; agency was distributed among different subjects. On multi -faceted processes of internationalization, see also the work of historian Maren M\u00f6hring (2012) on 'ethnic' restaurants; on the role of foreign students in shaping protest movements since the 1950s, see Slobodian (2012). Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 2 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 8 illustrates.12 In one of the few texts that explicitly take u p this subject, American Studies scholar Sabine Broeck has critiqued how Afro -Americanophilia operated in German feminism at that time. On the one hand, she argues that many white German feminists of the 1970s used African American masculinity (and their a ttraction to African American men) as a foil, as a metaphor for more physical and grounde d ways of being in the world, and thus as a pathway to personal liberation. In contr ast to the post -Nazi German masculinities outlined by Dagmar Herzog (2005) but echo ing deeper racial mythologies, African American men seemed to embody an 'uncompromised vi rility' (Broeck 2007: 102).13 A familiar raced coding of physicality versus intellectuality i s co- opted here into feminist concerns about (white) German disembodied int ellectualism and ossified patriarchal ways of life. On the other hand, German feminism's Afro -Americanophilia was not all about men. Writers and activists like Angela Davis and Alice Walker inspir ed German feminists and provided them with important refere nce points for political analysis. Just as importantly, these women also communicated ways of being in the worl d through aesthetics and affects (Broeck 2007, 2011; Gerund 2013). However, Broeck a rgues primarily 'served ... white Ge rman women -identified women to satisfy both their aesthetic desire and their political need for an articulation of embodiment' (2011: 129). She stresses that despite the rhetoric of sol idarity and liberation, there was little dialogue with African -American s (or with Black Germans) in the 1970s and early 1980s. There were few attempts to understand racism other than as a metaphor for sexism or discrimination more generally, and in the exceptional cases German feminists tended to be concerned with situations in countries like the USA or South Africa, or with guest workers generically. Schematically put, black 'Others' remained 'other,' but were useful for the self -improvement of white 'egos' (Broeck 2011: 129). Only in the mid -1980s, through an increasing expo sure to Black feminist writings, did the constellation change to some extent, a point to w hich we return below. The texts Broeck reviews, from the 1950s to the mid -1980s, display what she calls an 12 For the purpose of this essay we count second -wave f eminism as part of new social movements and alternative milieu, notwithstanding numerous disagreements ab out that asso ciation. 13 For instance, Swiss best violence of heterosexual relationships, deploys her sexual relations with a black man \u2014presumably African -American \u2014as a crucial step towards 'discovery of her rights and sexual claims as a white female' and ultimately her identification as a lesbian (Broeck 2007: 101). Although sexual fulfillment came with women, Stefan argued th at black men 'inhabit[ed] their bodies more directly than white people' (Broeck 2007: 101). Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 2 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 9 'abolitionist sentiment' [ Stellvertreter (surrogate/proxy) abolitionism], spanning time, gender, and politics. She suggests that a 'local configuration of [Am erican] sentiment' was taken up by white Germans for whom it underpinned their reception of black politics and cultural forms, thereby holding white German ' guilt' at a distance. Such sentiment, and this does not only concern the feminist context, could not however 'devise a critical epistemology which could have taken German anti -black racism, Germany's role in the history of the slave trade and colonialism, actual German implications in an international black diaspora, and a self -critical reading of white hegemony into account' (2011: 128). Despite convincing critical historical evaluations like Broeck's, w hich resonate with current critiques in critical rac e/whiteness studies and cultural anthropology (Eggers 2005; Partridge 2012), we can interpret some of this history of German engagement in a more positive light as well. In a basic way, the interest in Af rican American literature, and in female writers in particular, yields further proof of the relevance of African American thought for various social movements and their models of subjec tivity throughout the 20th century. It is also worth stressing that in this context a cont entious international debate bega n to develop about the interdependence of racial and gender oppression. If white Germans began to question the would -be universality of their perspectives, then this is one of the few sites where they \u2014and feminist intellectuals in particular \u2014started to do so. Furthermore, despite the racializing implications of ideas about embodiment and the problematic resonances with sexualized cultural imaginaries of 'authentic' physicality, those ideas also broke oppressive social taboos, diversified ways of relating to the world and increased the freedom of choice in sexual partners for different groups of people. At the same time, of course, such choi ces did not occur in a setting devoid of power imbalances.14 Afro -German activism and Afro -Americanophilia The main imp ulse prompting an awareness of race within feminism and the alte rnative culture came not from US authors, but from within Germany. A ma jor break in the 14 The most obvious point is that within the German citizens hip and migration 'border regime,' Hess and Kasparek's term (2010), marriage allowed non -citizens access to longer -term residency permits, which gave a certain amount of power to white Germans, many of them w omen. Damani Partridge spells out the dynamic since the 1990s: 'What previously would have been abject beings become subjects, but in a way that preserves and even depends on their position as ou tsiders. In the contemporary German context, Black male bodies can be incorporated if White women see them as beautiful and if they successfully perform hypersexually. The process is not one of normalization, but of hyper sexualization' (2012: 81). Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 2 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 10 racial 'relationships of representation' (Hall 2013) occurred during the 1980s, as self - organized Black groups were formed in Germany and other parts of Europe (Blakely 2012). In the middle of the decade, a group of women writers, histori ans and activists, including May Ayim [then named Opitz], Katharina Oguntoye identity as Afro-deutsch (Afro -German), and began to research Black German history and anti -black racism in Germany. The Black German organizations Initiative Schwarze in Deutschland (ISD, Blacks in Germany Lobby) and Schwarze Frauen in Deutschland (ADEFRA, Black Women in Ge rmany) were founded, with other groups following. An important catalyst here was the African American Audre Lorde --'Black lesbian feminist mother poet warrior,' as she described herself --who gathered a group of Black German students and others at the Ameri can Studies Department of Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin in 1984, when she was a visiting lecturer there.15 The landmark 1986 book by Oguntoye, Ayim Our Colo rs. Afrogerman Women Speak Out [1991]) emerged from this grouping. Presented as 'A collective biography of Black history in Germany,' it consists of historical research, group dis cussions and portraits as well as poetry (Piesche 2012: 11. See also El -Tayeb 2011; Gerund 2013). Farbe bekennen marked a break in the relationships of representation in two ways. First, its authors articulated their experiences, shared historical researc h and postulated a diverse Afro -German collective subject unwilling to wear th e masks that racial discourses -- anti-black, exoticist and Afro -Americanophile --had created. Second, the book situated Afro -Germans within both Germany and a wider African or Black Diasporic world (Piesche 2012: 15). Meeting other Afro -Germans within a self -defined setting was empowering for many involved, particularly those who had grown up in an all -white environment, without much contact with their black parent.16 The book presented a critical feminist and Black Consciousness framework to the Blac k German community - to-be, as well as to a wider German audience. There was now a vi sible and vocal Black presence in Germany that could no longer be defined as 'outside' Germa nness, and there were experts and Betroffene (affected parties) who were available to be c onsulted. Thirty years on, Afro -German activism has an established history and has passed through various key moments. Difficult debates about the relationship bet ween Black 15 Dagmar Schultz, who was on the teaching faculty and had bee n politically active in the women's movement, assisted her. See Schultz's film, Audre Lorde: The Berlin Years 1984 to 1992 (Schultz 2012). 16 Some participants had their own transnational networks o f black relatives and friends (Piesche 2012). Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 2 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 11 and white feminism, as well as between Afro -Germans, the African or Black Diaspo ra and other 'people of colour' have taken place (Wright 2004; Laur\u00e9 al -Samarai et al. 2007). Nonetheless, many white Germans have continued to use their own ide as of blackness as if nothing had happened.17 For our discussion of Afro -Americanophilia, two points should be highlighted. First, women testify to the sexualized exoticism and heightened interest in das Fremde [the Oth er] that they experience as forms of everyday racism. For example, May Ayim (writing as May O pitz) discerns how exoticism works to construe Black Germans as alien ( fremd ) in their own world, often by associating them with pleasurable difference, and by the eternally recurring question, 'Where are you really from?' (see also Kilomba 2008). Laura Baum, who notes how blackness is still routinely conflated with Africanness, observes the process by which Germans 'attribute to African men and women that which the y themselves lack' (1986: 149). Thos e attributes include 'a primordial sense of rhythm' and an ability to 'live out their emotions'. Within the alternative \u00d6ko-Milieu [environmental activist milieu], people like Ayim would be expected to have 'interesting stories' to tell on the basis of their 'race' \u2014the flip side of the Alternative -scene Afro -Americanophilia mentioned by Broeck . Such 'positive' projections were problematic in themselves, and they also would not prevent difficulties arising elsewhere, for example when seeking to gain access to a nightclub with a black partner.18 Some contributors to Farbe bekennen stress their agency when dealing with 'positive' prejudice, showing how they can use it to their own advantage. But the overall attitude is summar ized by Adema Adomako who comes to the conclusion that 'I have to keep my head up in a society that seems neutral, but isn't' (1986: 201). Farbe bekennen 's critique of exoticism partly a 'Black knowledge archive' about the pathologies of whitene ss and represents an exercise in 'counter -memory' (Eggers 2005; Campt 2004). Maureen Maisha Eggers (2005) remarks that Black Germans have built up a largely informal 'archive of knowledge' about the pathologies of whiteness where, for instance, white Germa ns' insecurities and defense 17 Continuing debates about the legitimacy of performances in blackface, for instance in theatre performances of Genet's The Blacks or Dea Loher's Unschuld [Innocence], or in G\u00fcnter Wallraff's 2009 undercover investiga journalism, which he undertook in blackface as a Somal i tourist in Germany, are cases in point (Thurn 2014; Sieg 2015). 18 Ayim points out the interrelatedness of these patterns (sh e also speaks positively about her experiences in cities like Paris and London where she did not feel constantly classified and judged). Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 2 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 12 mechanisms are the root of their projections, rather than inherent characteristics of the objects of their love and derision. In sum, the book squarely confronted the German situation, and did so from a new perspective. These a ccounts made it very clear that white German Afro -Americanophilia was not an innocent practice, but part of tangible power relations. The second point we would like to stress about Farbe bekennen is that the Black German movement of the 1980s should be u nderstood in part through its complicated relationship with the African American world, since it relied heavily on African American thought, activism, and cultural heroes (Gerund 2013). The Afro -German activist and German Studies scholar Peggy Piesche stre sses, for example, how the East German Angela Davis solidarity campaign was meaningful to her in her younger years, providing her with a glamorous yet serious role model. In a similar ve in, Katharina Oguntoye (in Piesche 2012: 34) and Maureen Maisha Eggers (2005) discuss the American expatriate Josephine Baker as a role model in their own Afro -German biographies, drawing inspiration from how she attempted to circumvent and s ubvert stereotypes in her life (see our discussion of this aspect in our fi rst surve y essay in this special edition). These are not isolated cases. Michelle Wri ght speaks of an 'intense identification some Afro -Germans express towards African -Americans' (2010: 268). This would be very important in the rise of German hip -hop culture, too, in which some Black Germans prominently figure. Here, then, is a type of German (and simultaneously Black Diaspori c) Afro - Americanophilia that differs, in some ways radically, from what we have reviewed so far. Is it even appropriate or productive to spe ak here of 'German Afro - Americanophilia' or should we choose different terminology? After all, there are basic differences, experientially and politically. An individual who exper iences racism and racialization in a society where, more often than not, whit eness functions as an unquestioned norm starts from a different position than white Afro -Americanophiles who opt into symbolic blackness, most likely during a brief phase in the ir life, and who probably never leave their place of privilege in the process. Practices of adaption and appropriation might seem very similar on the surface, but the meani ngs and their performative effects can be radically different. Very simply put , for Afro -Germans the politics of Afro -Americanophilia are likely to be much more em ancipatory. This is a Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 2 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 13 point that is convincingly made in critical discussions about race and appropriation (Aikins 2004). However, with these reservations in mind, we think it apposite to discuss these writings and activities under the title of German Afro -Americanophilia for several reasons. First, the term denotes a cultural theme , rather than offering a universal analysis of the politics of the phenomena. Second, there are practical similarities given that Black Germans, too, have had to appropriate vari ous aspects of Black Diasporic culture individually and collectively, since Diasporic belonging takes pra ctical, intellectual and emotional work, and does not just happen 'naturally.' Af ro-German translations of US culture also had the potential for misund erstanding, and in both cases the mass media was an important factor. Not without reason, Mic helle Wright (2010) uses the term 'becoming Black' when speaking of Black European experience s, including those of Black Germans. Indeed, many Afro -German activist s were exposed to Black US culture through the same media as other Germans around them, and it was through mainstream media rather than a functioning community that many bega n to learn about the wider African Diasporic world (Wright 2010: 268). To denatura lize the connection is not to delegitimize it, however. Moreover, it is nece ssary to consider the differences and the similarities between white and Black forms of Afro - Americanophilia in Germany in order to avoid a facile conflation of race, cultural practice and identity politics. It staves off any tendency to bracket B lackness from Germanness. Even though Afro -Americanophile processes of appropriation and re - production are based in hierarchical dualities of racial mythology, thos e processes cannot simply be conceptualized as a binary matter, but are multi -faceted and gradual. This point becomes clearer in the realms of popular music, which r emained a crucial arena of German Afro -Americanophilia in the late 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. In the following sectio ns, we limit our discussion to selected soundings of popular music and its social worlds in that historical period. Music -based subcultural scenes must be understood as local versions of transnational genres and networks, and various scenes in Germany have taken up genres of global, African American coded popular culture and constructed different imageries, semantics, and performative dime nsions. We start our soundings in the German reception of African American musical culture since the 1970s by returning to the GDR. We then move through different musical genres and subcultures in pre - and post -unification Germany where Afro -Americanophilia has figured. These areas include blues (and blues -rock), disco, techno, and hip -hop/rap. Our Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 2 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 14 discussion again focuses on mimetic practices, on patterns of appropriation and on the diverse politics involved. The cultural significance and inter -subjective relevance of popular music depends not only on the discursive level. Questions of rhythm, melody, and sound are crucial for a more complete account of musical Afro -Americanophilia, but we do not attend to those matters in this survey essay.19 Blues, blues -rock and the paradigm of authenticity In the German Democratic Republic, domestication and control of Wes tern popular music replaced outright repression in the 1970s. Modernization and (limite d) liberalization tendencies took hold; the obsessively political reading of African American popular music by the state began to recede into the background (Rauhut 2008). Neverthele ss, informal groupings of young people outside state -sponsored organizations such as the Freie Deutsche Jugend [Free German Youth] were still seen as a threat, and some of these groups revolved around African -American culture. Indeed, the so -called Blueser [blues fans] formed the major oppositional youth subculture in East Germany in the 1970s and early 1980s. Aesthetically reminiscent of hippies, the Blueser assembled in more or less clandestine meetings all over the GDR (Kochan 2002; Rauhut 2008). Michael Rauhut argues that their 'almost religious' admiration for the blues was conditioned by both a traditional 'Euro -Romantic' image of African - Americans as possessing existential 'authenticity,' and also by an i dentification with African American oppression (2008: 245). The blues became both 'free space' and 'counter world' for white East German adherents who saw in Afri can American blues artists both an 'ancestral history of their own suffering' as wel l as 'emotional purity' (2008: 245). The Blueser were an important presence in eastern Germany after the fall of the Wall, and well into the 1990s. There were similar circl es and dynamics among blues -rock afficionados in the alternative milieu of the West, but they di d not have quite the same cultural significan ce. Overall, the Blueser and others constituted part of a strong cultural continuity of rockist, primarily male Afro -Americanophilia that stresses a sensibility it considers earthy, primordial, pure and existential ly authentic, in touch with an inner human nature. In this strand of Afro -Americanophilia, positively -coded attributes like authenticity are \u2014implicitly or explicitly \u2014contrasted with contemporary European life, which includes both the demands of a rationalized, industr ial society, as 19 Nor can we attend to the significance of other changes in a uditory cultures, such as those that are being analysed by scholars working in the field of sound studies (Eshun 1998; Weheliye 2005). Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 2 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 15 well as a pop musical culture that is regarded as plastic.20 This, too, remains compatible with primitivist German and European traditions, and, partly with the Neger stereotype we discussed in our first survey essay. In West Germany certain genres \u2014initially blues -rock, then increasingly reggae --began to feature within the new social movements and left -wing Alternative culture and its institutions (Reichardt & Siegfried 2010; Ege 2010; Reichardt 2014). Her e, too, music was not just an entertaining commodity but crucial --sometimes foundational --for countercultural subjectivities and aesthetics.21 Beyond authenticity: Munich disco and 'pop' sensibilities The blues (and reggae) fans, with their particular interest in the 'authentic' and their counter -cultural, critical dis position, form one end in a spectrum of music -cultural sensibilities of the late 1970s. At the same time, German 'pop' aesthetics were also becoming more complex, and in some cases self -aware and self -referential (Shahan 2013; Hurley 2015: 54, 79 -80). Disc o represents an important moment in German (and international) music history here.22 It provides an example of a popular musical genre rooted in African American culture and in signs of blackness, but dist inct from the common paradigm of 'authenticity.' The genre began in the early -to-mid 1970s and reached its international peak in the late 1970s, including in Germany. As the musicologist Peter Wicke has observe d, in the mid-1970s, popular music entered a new moment in Germany and Europe (quoted in Wagner 1999: 113). If during late 1960s rock articulated with a sense of radica l social upheaval \u2014which, among some fans, included moments of symbolically 'becoming black' \u2014then for many there was a change in mood during the early 1970s. Wicke 20 There is a need for more differentiated analyses of these dynamics that go beyond such schematic descriptions. For a description of the survival of (and ambiguities in) 'rockist' notions of 'authenticity' in Germany into the 1990s and beyond, see Hurley (2015: 119 -158), and the references cited there. 21 We do not inquire here into the German reception and re -contextualization of reggae, nor its alignment with Alternative culture in Germany during the 1970s and 1980s (Karnik & Ph ilipps 2007; Schmid t 2002). However, the connection between the meanings of musica l forms like reggae, alternative culture and emergent multiculturalism could be researched more extensively, es pecially in regard to the culturalist lens of difference and (more or less explici t) notions of authenticity held in that context. As an ideology , multiculturalism was taken up and elaborated in the context of the Alternative milieu, and it was (partly) institutionalized by left -leaning city governments like the one in Frankfurt am Main . On multiculturalism and German cultural policy, see Welz (1996), Knecht and Soysal (2007); Lanz (2007). Some reggae also articulated with mainstream novelty exoti cism in cultural works like the 1983 West German comedy film, Sunshine Reggae au f Ibiza (Sunshine Reggae on Ibiza). 22 In post -punk, citation pop and other sub -genres, aesthetics of artificiality and intertextuality also emerged as concerns (Feiereisen 2011; Shahan 2013; Hurley 2015 : 95-106). Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 2 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 16 argues that in the 19 70s many young people became more interested in hedonism rather than political upheaval as in the late -1960s (cited in Wagner 1999: 113). This especially held true for that majority of young people who were interested in popular music but lived outside of Alternative left-wing culture.23 On a musical level, Munich's scene illustrates the shift these writers talk about: whereas the l ate 1960s had spawned the radical music -commune, Amon D\u00fc\u00fcl, by the mid -1970s it was home to Munich Disco. Nelson George, an em inent writer on African -American popular music, has lamented that disco, especially 'white' varieties like Munich Disco, dea lt a blow in the 'death of rhythm and blues,' which for him was an emphatically African Ame rican music (1990: 181-208).24 German auth ors and critics steeped in the rock tradition were similarly dismissive (Elflein 1998: 256; Witzel -116). However, the music's intellectual supporters countered with a cultural -historical argument questioning narrow notions of authenticity, and such arguments are relevant to the history of German Afro -Americanophilia in a more general sense. Disco emerged among African Americans and Latinas and Latinos in c ities like Philadelphia and New York City in an ethnically diverse gay dance culture, and then became a world -wide mainstream pop phenomenon, popularized by musicians such as George McCrae.25 In Munich, the producer Giorgio Moroder (born Hansj\u00f6rg Moroder in Southern Tyrolia, Italy) developed a Munich Disco style that reli ed he avily on synthesizers, most memorably in the 1977 Donna Summer hit, 'I Feel Love ,' for which Summer, Moroder and Pete Bellotte were co -writers. Other German -based disco -pop producers, such as Frank Farian, who created Boney M, and Michael Kunze , also emplo yed African -Diasporic and African people as writers, musicians, band members and stage performers, although not exclusively. Individual musical skills were sometimes decisive, but some choices may have been made because bla ck (often female) bodies anchored the musical product in a type of appeal for producers and audience alike, they served as 'harbingers of the exotic and foreign' (Weheliye 2014). 23 Such a perspective may well echo the 'roc kist' counterculture's anti -disco stance, which some critics link to the anxieties of masculine heterosexuality faced wi th queer aesthetics and pleasure (Frank 2007). 24 George's account of the role of radio audience research and the culture of musical corp orations is particularly compelling in his tale of the 'death' of rhythm and blues . See also Perry Hall's pessimistic account (1997) of the effects that white appropriations of African -American music have had on musical developments, even though African -American musicians kept searching for new forms. 25 McCrae's 'Rock Your Baby' was also a number one hit for ten w eeks in Germany in 1974. Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 2 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 17 In a few cases, blackness was also denoted in the titles of songs like Boney M's 'Everyone Wants to Dance Lik e Josephine Baker' (1989). On the basis of existing scholarship, it is hard to contemplate wha t types of Afro - Americanophilia the German consumers of this music might have exhibit ed at the time.26 Was one less or more likely to generate fantasies of 'beco ming black' whilst listening and dancing to this music in upper -middle class discos, or on the radio, compared with an earlier enthusiasm for soul music or jazz? In or der to find out more about these dynamics of Afro -Americanophilia in disco music, includi ng in networks of musical creation and value distribution, and in the lifeworlds of those it touched, it would be necessary to study in detail the semiotics and the material ity of the music itself, to assemble different accounts of the time, and to take into account the economic and contractual side of the music business. In addition, one would need t o contemplate the social history of nightclubs and club -goers. In the latter context, Alexander Weheliye (2012) has already identified that many German disco -pop oriented discotheques and nightclubs were unusually diverse, cosmopolitan spaces. Music historians and cultural critics have noted that the overall a esthetic of disco -- especially when it became more electronic, as in the Munich Sound --was happy with artificiality , with the 'cheesy' rather than 'earthy' sounds and arrangements of soul music. The notorious criterion of authenticity, which had dominated the discourse of German Afro -Americanophilia, hence became problematic and perhaps even obsolete i n this context. This did not just relate to the music's reliance on synthes izers. Munich Disco also witnessed the receding into the background of myths of personal or collective expression, given that some of it was produced electronica lly, that the production p rocess was based on a clear division of labour between producer and musical workers, and that those who recorded the music were not neces sarily those who performed it live.27 Despite Munich Disco's African -American roots and elements, and even though it oft en relied on associations with black performers, aesthetics, sounds and 26 Dietmar Elflein correctly identifies a 'gap in sociolo gical knowledge' here (1998: 256). Compare also the comparative lack of depth to Mark Terkessidis' fleeting discussion (2006). The lack of knowledge is closely connected to the intellectual left's dismissal of t he disco scene as a -political, hedonistic and conservative \u2014but maybe also to the fact that the 1970s and 1980 s are only slowly being explored by historians. For a latterday appreciation of 'Mjunik Disco,' see H ecktor (2008). 27 Similar modes of musical production had predominated in, fo r instance, the rhythm -and-blues era, and also pertained to German Schlager mus ic. Some left -wing German critics applied a Marxist critique towards the alienation of session musicians from their labou r (Harun Farocki cited in Witzel et al. 2005). Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 2 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 18 bodies, such music may not have been considered as intrinsically ' black' a sound, as say soul music, reggae, afro -beat or funk. In many ways, Munich Disco superficially relied on aesth etics of blackness, and on black performers. But in other ways, Munic h Disco could be read as implying a level of indifference toward racial c oding. Post-Soul aesthetics: Techno and the Pop-Intellektuelle [pop intellectuals] Such tendencies seem to offe r a possible way out of the primitivist paradigm. We can speak of racial de -semanticization here: A stress on music's sonic materiality, on physical experience and affect, whereby discursive anchoring becomes a s econdary concern, or fades out in experience , so that specific sounds that could otherwise be read as 'soulful' and emphatically ' black' are decontextualized and do not necessarily stand for anything. This motif is relevant in a more fundamental sense t o the development of electronic dance music, an d this leads our discussion into the 1990s. Techno is a particularly relevant case to discuss here because African -American musicians in Detroit invented much of it, and at the same time it is often t aken to be a particularly German music, both among Germa ns and internationally (more so than House music with its disco lineage). German musicians and deejays have made si gnificant contributions to the field, and some popular interpretations have tended t o emphasise the form's techno and German Afro -Americanophilia, it is helpful to first contemplate an important shift in some African American culture in the 1980s and 1990s, namely the rise of a so -called 'post -soul aesthetic.' As Be rtram Ashe points out, this sensibility 'lives in the unstable, wobbly interstices' betwe en what many had hitherto regarded as the 'discrete cultural categories' of 'bla ck' and 'white,' and amongst practitioners who 'use non black cultural in fluences in their work' (2007: 611). Many African American artists and cultural workers who w ere born in or came of age during the Civil Rights era increasingly considered that 'the black aesthetic [was] much more than just Africa and jazz,' as one polemic had it (Ellis 1989: 234). Such an aesthetic impinged on individual African -American artists who created musical forms like Detroit techno in the 1980s. Detroit techno had its own pos t-soul--indeed 28 A full discussion of Afro -Americanophilia in techno would have to include the c ase of Westbam (Maximilian Lenz), one of Germany's most successful deeja ys, whose name, according to the artist himself, is an abbreviation of 'Westphalia Bambaataa,' echoing his home region in North -Western Germany and the African American music pioneer Afrika Bambaataa (see Westbam & Goetz 1997). Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 2 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 19 Germanophile --background; its protagonists were influenced by the electro -pop band Kraftwerk, and in more House -based forms, by synthesizer -based Munich Disco. As with our speculative interpretation of Munich Disco, the post -soul sensibility would seem to forestall older forms of German Afro -Americanophilia or at least change the tone. It provides much less fodder for quasi -romantic ideas of black authenticity, as in the primitivist tradition that lived on in blues rock and reggae im aginaries in Germany. Nor does it support imagined resistance towards 'The Man,' as in 1960s and 1970s counterculture, Detroit techno group Underground Resistance notwithstandi ng. Post - soul also eschews more vague semiotic associations with 'black' s ensuality and hedonism, as in disco and, perhaps, in disco -derived House music.29 In the 1990s, new, more self -aware --or perhaps more sublimated --forms of Afro - Americanophilia also emerged in the writings of German music journa lists, musicians, and other intellectuals who made their own sense of post -soul techno, a music that is purportedl y not primarily about 'meaning.'30 In some cases, the music's historical emergence in black Detroit in the 1980s allowed for Afro -Americanophile interpretations in which these historical roots are interpreted a s the essence of the music (Bachor 1995). Of mo st interest to our discussion however are the desemanticizing interpretations that have contemplated techno as what, for want of a better term, we might call 'Afro/German' (which is unlike the community appellati on 'Afro -German'). For example the musician, broadcaster and writer Thomas Meinecke has been interested in the complex 'transatlantic feedback' between Afro -America and Germany, as well as in the mutually constituting imaginaries, and at a more prosaic leve l, in the decision by African -American DJ -composers to record and live in Germany, or collaborate with Germans. Here, Afro -Americanophilia becomes a highly self -reflexive matter that takes up a post -soul aesthetic where that which is being appropriated is quite conspicuous ly also white, European, a nd even German. An absorption with such complexities is evident in First Take then Shake , the 2004 collaborative recording by Meinecke's band, Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle [Voluntary Self Regulation], and the African American DJ Anthony 'Shake' Shakir. It i s also an ongoing theme in Meinecke's 2001 Suhrkamp 29 The voice and cultural meaning of the (African American) soul 'diva' in House music is explored in Jochen Bonz's ethnography (2008: 49 -51) as constitutive for that musical world. Bonz refers to the cultural figure o f a Black 'superwoman,' as analysed by Michelle Wallac e (2000 [1979]). 30 As a style of the future that is now 'sedimented' (Nye 201 0), techno has been the subject of various German -language popular historical studies (see Denk & van Th\u00fclen 2012; Rapp 2009) . Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 2 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 20 novel Hellblau [Pale Blue]. The latter refrains from presenting any neatly digested interpretations, but seeks to index music discourse about techno, among othe r foci, as a way of investigating the transn ational. The novel's protagonists thereby query such categories as white and black, African American and German, just as Meinecke learned to do in his own appreciation of forms such as techno (Hurley 2012). The characters expressly pr\u00e9cis and reflect upon Paul Gilroy's notion of the Black Atlantic and other writings from primarily British and US academic critical rac e and gender/queer theory, seeking to transpose them into a middle -European context. Meinecke is among a number of un -dogmatic left -wing and anti-racist (white) German writers and Popintellektuelle [pop intellectuals] who, particularly since the mid -1990s, have written extensively on African American culture, politics, a nd criticism, as well as on the politics of Afro -Americanophilia \u2014and have e mbodied it themselves. Among these writers are G\u00fcnther Jacob, Tobias Nagl, and, most prominently, the music and art critic -cum-theorist Diedrich Diederichsen, a former editor of Spex magazine, a brainy, high-gloss music monthly.31 Diederichsen has co -edited a volume American criticism ( Yo! the Alien,' and co -edited the with Paul Gilroy, further mediating the 'Black Atlantic' to German audience s. Such writers provide numerous German musings on the question of why so many African American mus ical forms have encapsulated specific historic moments so powerfully, or otherwise had such purchase on listeners \u2014why, simply put, Afro -Americanophilia is a very deserved love. But techno was not the only music form to draw out such musings in the 1990s. There was also a sizeable discourse on rap and hip -hop, musical forms that, in contrast with techno, are not desemanticized in a post -soul way, but on the c ontrary are very clearly enmeshed in Black culture and politics, including cultural nationalism. Moreover, artists have often commented directly on questions of cultural ownership and exploita tion. Hip-hop and rap became the dominant pop cultural aesthetic in the new millennium, something like a pop cultural lingua franca with many local varieties .32 They represent 31 In Subito , a short story by the so -called Popliterat [pop -novelist] Rainald Goetz, a the Advanced Music Journalism mili eu in Germany, see Hurley (2015: 54 -55, 79-83). 32 Kenell Jackson speaks of the 'last surge of black cultural t raffic' and one 'that we currently inhabit'; acknowledging that 'hip -hop has traveled to new places on a scale unimaginable for earlier black cul tural Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 2 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 21 the last cultural phenomenon we will consider in this essay --illustrating both the relevance and the complexity of Afro -Americanophilia in contem porary Germany. Rap and hip -hop In 1998 Tom Cheesman suggested that in Germany, rap and hip -hop--initially regarded as essentially African American cultural forms --'seem to have been received and adopted more enthusiastically than anywhere else in Europe ' (1998: 194).33 Hence, and for at least twenty -five years now, the issue of Afro -Americanophilia has returned with a vengeance to the forefront of German cultural debates. In contrast to the last high point in the late 1960s, however, the underlying contex t is of a more diverse German society that has undergone shifts and developments via reunification and an emergent new nationalism, as well as globalization and transnationalism, f orces recognized by social scientists and the wider public as major developm ents in the post -Cold War era.34 The German rap and hip -hop scene has long been pluralistic (Elflein 1998: 264).35 At the levels of production and reception, hip -hop has adopted various subject positions, some of which we elaborate below. Some musicians us e the genre to express straightforward pop sensibilities and boy -meets -girl-stories. Some use the idiom to articulate their own social (ethnic, racial, class) margina lity, which may or may not mean adopting (and adapting) a gangsta pose. Some express 'tran sracial' solidarity within the genre, and even anti -capitalist and anti -patriarchal politics. Others refracted the African -American cultural nationalism evident in some hip -hop into German variants. In the following section, we examine a few points in the complex history of German hip -hop, which represents a much larger phenomenon than earlier moments of Afro -Americanophilia such as the Negrophile 1920s or the counter -cultural late 1960s. It is clear that the underground beginnings of rap in Germany did no t just come about via the mediation of the culture industry, but also through people who bridged material' (2005: 23). He also argues that the rise o f hip -hop represents arguably the main reason for the surge of academic and intellectual interest in popula r culture \u2014and laments that this focus has led to a widespread disinterest in other forms of black cultural traffic. Given the importance of hip -hop, we nonetheless believe it is necessary to spell out its implicat ions for Afro -Americanophilia here. 33 We should note, however, that similar diagnoses have also be en made about France, which has a v ery active rap music scene and is an important market for US -origin rap as well. 34 See, for example, Arjun Appadurai's influential writings o n transnational/global ' -scapes' (1996). 35 On the history of the German rap scene, see: Pennay ( 2001), Krekow and Steiner (2002), Verlan and Loh (2006), and Loh and G\u00fcng\u00f6r (2002). On sociologica l aspects see: Menrath (2001), Kaya (2001), Androutsopoulos (2002), Bennett (2002), Bock et al. (2007), Brown (2006), Templeton (2006). On German 'gangsta rap,' see Szillus (20 12), Dietrich and Seeliger (2012), and Ege (2013) . Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 2 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 22 continents. These actors included DJs and MCs who were African -American soldiers stationed in Germany, and who frequented nightclubs in cities such as Heidelbe rg/Mannheim, Stuttgart, Frankfurt and Berlin. From there, rap musi c moved into a small -scale, diverse youth -cultural scene, where the whole hip -hop package \u2014rap, breakdancing and graffiti --was performed. This scene was fueled by music, hip -hop films like Beat Street , and the German -American co -production, Wild Style , as well as by various books and magazines that popularized hip -hop culture. The new medium of music television also played a significant role in making popular forms of rap more widely known, an d in an audiovisual form. This was important because it meant that visual aspects and bodily styles could become key to local hip -hop culture. The scene comprised self -organized circles of enthusiasts, was supported by local cultural wor kers and youth cent res, and formed the basis for 'old school' German rap. The emergence of this early German hip -hop scene coincided roughly with reunification in 1990. The subsequent surge in nationalism, anti -immigrant and racist violence and anti-immigration policies in 1992 and 1993 brought issues of race and racism to the forefront, and these trends had impacts on German hip -hop.36 Some members of the early scene --itself socially, culturally and ethnically quite diverse --commented critically in their rhymes on everyday racism, and on the antiquated German citizenship laws. For example, Advanced Chemistry released a song titled 'Fremd im eigenen Land' [Foreign in my own country], an early German instance of conscious, m essage rap. Here, hip-hop represented a 'universal,' anti-racist youth culture where Germans of colour and Black Germans such as Torch could express an assertive political vo ice and, as it were, re-invent Afro -Americanophilia as a progressive project (Loh & G\u00fcng\u00f6r 2002). The African -American origins of rap music and the concerns of African Americans did matter a great deal to many in this scene. However, contrary to the impression of hip - hop skeptics who often ridiculed the scene as full of wannabe -blacks, Afro - Americanophilia was not necessarily the core co ncern on a lifeworld level. For many, the main thing was to master the performative aspects of hip -hop, and the dynamics of the social world in which it takes place, or universalist ideas of a global hip -hop culture. In any event, political and oppositiona l message rap has remained an important element 36 The violence was, however, mostly not considered under the r ubric of racism, but of Ausl\u00e4nderfeind - lichkeit [hostility to foreigners]. Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 2 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 23 of German hip -hop.37 Again, there have been overlaps and convergences between musical -subcultural circles and leftist countercultural -political scenes. For many young Germans in the 1990s, including the 'white ' majority, hip -hop played a crucial role in countercultural identity formation, where, to sketch just one importa nt distinction, hip - hop often articulated a more aggressive, masculinist sensibility t han reggae.38 As in the early 1970s, contemporary popular music and radical political resistance again seemed to converge in the African American world, now represented in the fi gure of savvy, assertive, disciplined and emotionally 'cool' male rappers.39 German authors like G\u00fcnther Jacob (2001) argue in this cont ext that a great deal of rap is politically ambiguous, not least because it articulates an 'oppositional consciousne ss,' but can simultaneously convey what Angela Davis calls 'a nationalism packed wi th misogynistic undertones' (quoted in Diederichsen 1993: 210). Indeed, rap's association with misogyny and assertive masculinity became a watchword in Germa n debates about rap's cultural significance. This again underscores how race, gender , and sexuality are interdependently defined, experienced and contested in German Afro -Americanophilia. The first German -language pop -rap hits by Die Fantastischen Vier [The Fantastic Four] did not come from the subcultural 'old school' scene. Their 1992 hit song ' Die da' [Her over there] had a novelty feel to it, even parod ying the hip -hop aesthetic (Verlan & Loh 2006), and echoed other forms of exoticism in the 1950s or 1980s, or mimet ic fads like the Cakewalk decades earlier. Most 'real' hip -hoppers despised this music, but similar songs and acts continue to play a role in German popular culture, including in the Euro - Dance genre, another genre of 'producers' music,' where the brief a ppearance of (mostly Black) rappers became de rigeur (Terkessidis 2006).40 Significantly, the reception of hip -hop in West Germany coincided with the coming of age of a generation of children of labour migrants and other Germans of colour, and quite a few of these young people, in addition to some from the sma ller group of Black 37 These forms found a high point during the wave of post -Wall xenoph obia of 1992 and 1993, including on Rap gegen Rechts [Rap against the Right], a symbolic anti -nationalist music compilation, and, later on, in the (largely) Afro -German crew, Brothers Keepers , which formed in response to racist attacks (El - Tayeb 2003; Wehe liye 2009). 38 Individuals in these circles often read Malcolm X's 196 5 (auto -)biography, published in German in 1992. 39 On Afro -German rap, gender and the reach for Blaxploitation (musical) iconography, see Layne (2013). 40 In the late 1990s hedonistically -minded party rap crews such Absolute Beginner had more 'credibility' than Die Fantastischen Vier , and dominated rap music sales. Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 2 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 24 Germans, gravitated towards rap and hip -hop culture's performative dimensions, fashion segment continues to include people from very different backgrounds and in very different positions, who have made very different music in dif ferent languages, including Turkish and German. It would therefore be quite mistaken to cons truct Turkish -German rap or Migranten -Rap (rap by migrants) as a cohesive genre. Like elsewhere in Europe, however, there has been a recurrent and much com mented -upon theme whereby (post -)migrant youth have sensed and/or claimed a similarity between aspects of African -American culture and experience and their own experience as minorities.42 Such appropriation, transfer and discursive comparison occur at the l evel of the aesthetics of everyday life.43 However, sometimes the music industry has also been involved, especially after the global turn toward gangsta rap during t he 1990s. Under the tutelage of labels like Universal/BMG, 'ethnic' Germ an gangsta rappers have performe d to expectations of street -credibility and realness, long held by white adolescent German men.44 The commodification of realness became particularly clear around 2000, when various rappers from Berlin and Frankfurt am Main, aide d by media -savvy entrepreneu rs, including the independent Aggro Berlin label, started performing taboo -breaking battle rap lyrics as well as tough German street rap, stressing their connections to the underworld, and their street wisdom. The post -industrial cityscape, increasing soci al inequality in the post -unification era, neo -liberal social policies, as well as anti -immigrant racism and Islamophobia all provided the background for many such narratives and for the iconography of the ghetto, even though the structural situation was h ardly comparable with postindustrial US cities. This broader phenomenon also included the controversial case of B -Tight, an Afro -German rapper from Berlin who, very much in tune with the over -the-top-sensibility of his 41 This engagement has also been reflect ed upon in literature, especially by the Turkish -German writer Feridun Zaimo lu's der Gesellschaft Notes from the Margins of Socie ty]. There is an extensive literature on Zaim olu and what Leslie Adelson has called the recent 'Turkish Turn' in German Cheesman 2002, 2007; Adelson 2005; Cheesman & Yesilada 2012). For an analysis of the way Zaimolu's characters engage in Afro -Americanophilia, see especially Layne (2011: ch 6). 42 Social anthropologist Ayse \u00c7a lar has argued that this comparison was also promoted by many youth workers \u2014a compelling argument that does not, however, explain the phenomena in toto . 43 Rap music and hip -hop aesthetics have also been attra ctive to some young men in self -styled 'street gangs.' In Berlin -Wedding, for example, one 1980s predominantly Turkis h gang named itself the 'Black Panterler' (Black Panthers) (Partridge 2012). These g angs began to form in the 1980s, for self -defence again st racist attacks, to exert dominance over others, to kill time and to enjoy life. 44 Similar dynamics are responsible for part of the success of gangsta rap in the USA, as various critics have pointed out (Rose 2008). Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 2 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 25 label's roster, aggressively employed racist clich\u00e9s of violence and sexual potency and was accused by Black German activists, among others, of exploiting and reinforming stereotypes and exploitative structures. There were a few Turkish - and Arab -German rappers, including 'Bushido,' who claim ed to have close links with drug dealers and extortion networks. They simultaneously asserted that white German r appers were too soft and lacked street credibility. Some of these rappers even cons idered that the 'urban' hip-hop fashions of African -American s, and of a sub -culturalist (but not 'street') hip - hop scene in Germany, were less real, or even 'gay' (Ege 2013). A few rappers also used racist language to distance themselves from rap's African -American origins, and from Black claims to ownership of the culture (Aikins 2006). Such highly contradictory positions illustrate the ambiguities of a situation where Afro -Americanophilia and traditional racism are both important cultural patterns, where ar t forms based in the Black diaspora have simultaneously be come part of a wider popular cultural repertoire and, to some extent, unmoored from their origins. In a general sociological sense, turning social marginality and negative ascriptions into a glamorous, empowering aesthetics of living in a ghetto has been an important discursive strategy within the identity projects and, in some case s, political strategems of many underprivileged young people in Germany, among other places.45 Imagery derived from rap and hip -hop, but also from a wider world of gangsta cultu re, has played a crucial role in that process, as German rap music and r ap videos show (Klein & Friedrich 2004). This is not necessarily a serious trend \u2014irony and self -reflexivity can figure prominently and a performative culture of 'dissing' is de r igeur. However, as Priscilla Layne (2011: ch. 6) has suggested of the German context, the strategy is a fraught one: it is very much open to debate how empowering are the iconographi es of the ghetto and rampant forms of masculinity.46 The various positions towa rds straightforward racism and toward Afro -Americanophilia taken by Afro -German rappers such as Torch, Sammy Deluxe, Afrob, Harris, B -Tight, 45 Compare, to 46 German hip -hop has also accommodated white nationalist strains, or what Dietm ar Elflein calls 'hip - hop nationalization' (1998: 260). This is the case with both the mid -1990s discourse of 'Neuer Deutscher Sprechgesang' [New German Reci tative], which sought out German cultural precedents for rap, and later 'street rap' nationalists like 'Fler' (the so -called 'Deutscha Badboy'). Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 2 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 26 Liquid, Lisi, and many others would be another important approach for a m ulti- perspectival history of Afro -American ophilia in the hip -hop world. One could also analyze both the common question of whether being black has aided or rather hindered their careers , as well as the conditions under which the question has arisen (Klei n & Friedrich 2004; Layne 2013).47 But then again, sorting rappers by backgrounds, race and ethnicity, is of very lim ited use and quite obviously problematic. The heterogeneity of the list above is testament to that. In recent years, new sub -genres and pop -rap acts have flourished, and, overall, ra p has become a familiar element of popular culture, such that it ha s lost any novelty character and is far from exotic or alien. As rap has become a dominant pop cultural form globally, there are indications that it has lost or shaken off the association w ith its US origins and become, at least potentially, another racially dese manticized idiom in a larger pop cultural repertoire. Our point here is not to try to repr esent this complexity in its entirety, but to acknowledge it, and to ask where it might lea ve the phenomenon of Afro -Americanophilia, and the racial dynamics from which it stems. I n this arena, too, we encounter different forms that involve not so much a straightforwa rd 'identification,' but rather a complex suite of recontextualizations, as well as the propagation and putting into discourse of stereotypical simplifications about African -America. There is not one version of Afro -Americanophilia in the context of German rap and hip -hop, but many, in which race is sometimes foregrounded and sometime s desemanticized. Some conclusions and questions At this point, it seems apposite to ponder what the literature we have surveyed has accomplished. Further, we must confront the inevitable question of whet her there is a meta -narrative that makes sense of all the forms and patterns of Afro -Americanophilia in Germany that we have described, and that relates them to large r forces, to world - historic 'developments,' to structures of racism, and to the str uggles against them. It is not our intent here to advance one major theoretical narrative, but rather to ponder the succession of historical conjunctures, and to suggest some analytical t ools for understanding them. From the beginning, we have contended that excavating the practices and patterns of Afro -American ophilia (in the widest sense) can contribute to a 47 Klein and Friedrich's argument about blackness as a ca reer booster in German rap is dubious given that the m ost successful German rappers have not been black. Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 2 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 27 cultural history of Western -central Europe and the African Diasporas that acknowledges a variety of interconnections, contributions, overlaps, hybridizations, exploi tative relationships and contestations. B ut we also heed the need to constantly re -think the terms with which to tell this narrative, and to invoke the fields and assemblages within which the practices, discourses, and affects of Afro -Americanophilia are situated. Our provisional periodization, based on recent scholarship about popular music, subcultures, emancipatory politics, and literature, has allowed us to sketch the contours of some Afro -Americanophile conjunctures in Germany since the mid -19th century. We have assembled a wide variety of A frican -American presences, cultural forms and discourses, and although these moments have been scattered and heterogeneous, marshalling them together makes it clear that the cultural histor y of 20th-century Germany cannot adequately be told without referen ce to its Afro -Americanophile components, or in isolation of a wider world where people of the Bla ck Diaspora have played crucial roles. German society and German peoples' lives have been considerably shaped by cultural forms that originated in Black Diasp oric worlds. As our essays have shown, the parameters determining the German fa scination with, and appropriation of, African -American cultural forms have shifted considerably. The mid-19th century projection of abolitionism into a nationalist, romantic s ensibility did not function in the same way as sexually coded, post -psychoanalytic 1920s primitivism, even though both partook of a common paradigm and ideology of white (European, Christian) supremacy. The binary complementarity and mutual exclusivi ty of 'black' and 'white,' which formed the semiotic basis for the racial re -valuations of early -20th century primitivism, was in some ways superseded by patterns of i magined equivalence in opposition to the power structure in late -1960s countercultural Afro -Ame ricanophilia. Nevertheless, this latter moment also fed off the older patter n. There was never a complete replacement, as older patterns continued to affect exotici st strains of Afro - Americanophilia. Some forms, such as those during the 1950s Civil Rights Movement and among many feminists, had a strong ethical -moral tone, while others were much more hedonistically oriented. We could elaborate here on other patte rns, but what we have already said suffices to make the general point about continuity and change . We have also sought to highlight different modes of Afro -Americanophile practices: intellectual engagement; consumption in carnevalesque Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 2 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 28 practical solidarity; and subcultural aesthetics, to name a fe w. We have stressed that these engagements take place in different social worlds, and with di fferent expectations of authenticity and commitment. Through some historiographical fragments, we have related how Afro -Americanophile moments have impinged upon the social history of black people in Germany, for whom exoticist projections have often acted as an oppressive force. We ha ve also mentioned, however, the covert forms of agency that are easily erased from s uch accounts, including for example tactical responses to the early German entertainment industry, and patterns of autonomy. We have stressed how Afro -Germans engaged in their own Afro -Americanophilia for political and cultural self -fashioning, particularly in the second half of the 20th century. Juxtaposing a history of Afro -Americanophilia with the perspective of Black people is vital, although the latter perspecti ve cannot be adequately understood from a vantage point such as ours; it must be told in its own right as Afro - German history. Nevertheless, one of the most important aspects of our survey has been to highlight the growing contestation of some aspects of white Afro -Americanophilia by black people, in Germany and elsewhere, and how Afro -Americanophilia, as part of a transnational assemblage of forms and sentiments, has also functioned as a cultural resource for various migrant subjects and groups. Even within our limited project of analyzing German Afro -Americanophile projections and practices of appropriation, there are some lacunae that we me ntioned in the introducto ry section of this and our previous essay. These include an attention to how Afro -Americanophilia has played out in fields like advertising, film, the atre, reportage writing, photography, ethnography, classical music and sports (including baske tball). Gay (such as in the work of Hubert Fichte), lesbian and/or queer narrati ves, which have been subtexts in some sections, would also add greatly to this wider his tory. Analytically, we have barely touched upon the connections with the wider African Diasporic wor ld and with mechanisms behind cultural flows. To do them justice, w e would need to give a more detailed investigation of the processes of m ediation in different genres and industries, of market dynamics, and of the ways different historical actors have int eracted with them. We would also need to attend to specific tra nsnational pathways. For example, we currently know little about how German att itudes to jazz may have been conditioned just as much by francophone jazz discourse, as t hey were by Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 2 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 29 discourses in the USA, or, for that matter, by German experiences of expatri ate Black Caribbean culture in the United Kingdom (see Detlef Siegfried's ar ticle on the key figure of Ernest Borneman in this special issue). Most importantly, any periodization should not ec lipse the question of whether different instances of Afro -Americanophilia in 20th century German history are merely different versions of one common theme, of a longue -duree deep structure of racial dynamics that determines all of its superficial manifesta tions. Are we, in other words, witnessing a re - staging of the same scene, over and over again? Our methodological decisi on to focus on specific conjunctures automatically downplays such continuities, but that is not to say that they are irrelevant. Numerou s theorists of racism have stressed continuities in (white) misrecognition and privilege, including Sabine Broeck (2011), who has discerned a pattern of continuity from 19th-century 'proxy abolitionism' to postwar West German Afro -Americanophilia. Broeck a rgues that, under the surface, things essentially stayed the same for over a hundred years. Our essays, a nd the analytical distinctions between historical phases and conjunctures we have used, have queried that position. However, we recognize that it can b e important to stress overarching continuities in unequal power relations and resources, both from an analyt ical and a political perspective. We acknowledge the basic point that, even in many of its later instantiations, white German Afro -Americanophilia w as based on and perpetuated racist hierarchies that stemmed from desire and misrecognition. Still , we consider this point to be obvious enough to move on to micro -political analyses and attend to moments of reflexivity, challenge, and potential 'lines of f light' from the reproduction of racism. By gathering in scattered historiographical snapshots, a timeline of Af ro-Americanophilia can also illuminate significant modulations in unmarked German whitene ss.48 Our overview may thus add some situational and conj unctural specificity to what is often \u2014 with some justification, given its continuing effects of exclusion and dominance \u2014 regarded as a monolithic structural force . How has unmarked German whiteness modulated in the period we have exami ned? Early forms of A fro-Americanophilia emerged in the context of a long -lasting formation of openly supremacist German whiteness, based in nationalism and underst andings of 48 This analytic category is problematic in the German con text in that it can be used to downplay other forms of dominance and exclusion, most importantly ant i-Semitism and the racism that targets immigrant s and their descendants for reasons other than their n on-whiteness; but it is indispensable. Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 2 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 30 culture and civilization that were closely entangled with patterns of European colonialism, and attemp ts to legitimate it. African American popular culture was s een as self-evidently alien to German culture, despite some romantic currents. This idea was still rampant, and openly articulated in public discussions, in both Ger man states into the 1970s, and i t gave the Afro -Americanophilia of self -described progressives a particularly combative tone and resistant flavour. In the new millennium, under the ambiguous conditions of globalization and new culturalisms, explicit cultural nationalist arguments are m ostly \u2014although not exclusively \u2014to be found on the extreme right, and race -based definitions of national belonging are considered out of place in most polite discussion. Recent Afro - Americanophilia (for example in some German rap of the 1990s and 2000s) is part of that conjuncture, where formerly racial attributions and meanings ar e desemanticized. However, scholars like Fatima El -Tayeb (2011) have pointed out that such desemanticizing attitudes have not diminished the importance of whitenes s as an unmarked norm and structure of dominance. Like many of their counterparts in the USA, many white Germans now assume that they are colour -blind, or even claim that they are not reall y white, which seems to denote a more relaxed mode of cultural i dentity (Sieg 2015). From a critical viewpoint, however, such statements can mask the inability to confront the ongoing privileges of being recognized as white in society that has not substantially confronted its racism, which it always situates el sewhere, abroad, among the 'less enlightened,' or below the line of middle -class respectability. Furthermore, contemporary white German self -definitions often express an omnivorous form, in which they (or should we say we?) consider themselves beyond the particula rities of culture an d history, free to consume at will, whereas numerous others are seen as fixed in time, space, and culture (El -Tayeb 2011).49 As a history of practices of appropriation Afro -Americanophilia has contributed significantly, even decisively, to such pa tterns. Looking at changes to Afro -Americanophilia as it functions as a lingua franca across various social divides, especially its diversification into Afro -German or (post -)migrant variants, also allows us to explore how and when unmarked German whit eness has be en challenged. Our chronological account has moved from histories of Fremdheit (Otherness/Alienness), told from the viewpoint of an imaginary racia lly homogenous 49 Many similar middle -class ideas of the Self exist in other countries too (S keggs 2005). Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 2 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 31 national Self, to a contemporary scenario featuring diversity and c ontestation, where there is no clear, homogeneous national centre that defines what is other or exot ic (Terkessidis 2002, 2006). In the process , Afro -Americanophilia has diversified to include shared, parallel, analogue forms and experiences of social a nd political marginality among st many different Germans. We have followed a largely Germany -centered timeframe, but ours has been a path of 'strategic methodological nationalism,' not intended to re -inscribe the importance of the national frame. In that sense, despite the ostensibly national focus of our two survey essays \u2014'Afro -Americanophilia in Germany '\u2014they have remained alive to the diversification in German society in the twentieth and twenty -first centuries, the transnational character of the Black Atlantic, to the waves and e ddies in black cultural traffic, and to the changing ways that cultural coalitions can be ma rked out and challenged. If these essays can be used as a historiographic stepping -stone to a more empirically grounded post-national approach that adds more layers a nd re -configures the object of analysis, all the better.

PORTAL is published under the auspices of UTSePress , Sydney, to Postwar (1850-1967) Moritz Ege, University of Munich Andrew Wright Hurley, University of Technology Sydney In this essay, which builds on the methodological considerations and the de finitions we sketched in the introduction to the special edition on what we are ca lling twentieth- century German Afro-Americanophilia, we delve into the history of Af ro- Americanophilia in Germany and of its precursors. Afro-Americanophi lia denotes the affirmative, enthusiastic, even loving approaches to African Ameri can culture, politics, and people. These, in turn, are heterogeneous acts that encompass ima ginations, practices and social relationships. Such acts have been theorized w ith concepts such as mimesis, identification, desire, translation, misunderstanding, appr opriation, expropriation, fetishism, hybridisation, or becoming-minor. Our aim he re, however, is not to theorize Afro-Americanophilia, but to establish a prelimi nary, mostly descriptive periodization and to draw out some of the particularly significant mome nts, ruptures, and continuities within it. In the process, we also identify some of the salient ways scholars have interpreted Afro-Americanophilia during those periods. T he tim eframe we cover in this first review essay stretches from the nineteenth century until the mid- 1960s, from which point the second essay continues. Focusing on a variety of appropriative practices, communicative media, actors and forms of agency, power differentials, and sociocultural contexts, we discuss positive ima ges of and affirmative Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 1 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 2 approaches to black people in German culture and its imaginary prior to the colonial era, and then during the colonial, Weimar, Nazi and postwar eras .1 As we argue in th e introduction to this special issue, our main term's juxtaposition o f the term 'Afro -American' \u2014which gained prominence in the 1960s in US Civil Rights discourse \u2014with a Greek suffix that may have clinical connotations to some readers is intended to indicat e the internal contradictions and occasional self -reflexivity of the phenomenon. The term thus resembles the earlier Negrophilia, which w e take up as a more historically specific concept later in this essay when disc ussing the 1920s. We use the term Afro -Americanophilia for pragmatic reasons to refer to diverse occurre nces at different points in time and in distinct contexts. We maintain tha t the phenomenon's political meanings cannot be exhaustively evaluated on a transhistorical level. Instead, those mean ings must be analyzed in regard to specific historical situations, which nevertheless take place under unequal, pre -structured conditions. Our interest in Afro -Americanophilia should not be read as an attempt to downplay racism. The German engagement wit h African -American culture has by no means only been one of love. Many Germans actively fought against the influence and pr esence of black people, including African -Americans, and some continue to do so. Describing and analyzing in precise and open -minded ways recurring acts of Afro -Americanophilia is important, but should not be taken to suggest that Afro -Americanophilia is socially dominant. Continuing everyday racism against people of colour, and violence against refugees (immediate and structural), make that abundantly clear. In a similar but analytically distinct sense, we also do not wis h to view the 'love' for African -American culture monochromatically. Racism can come in many form s, including some that profess love but are based on misrecognition a nd the more or less subtle exertion of dominance. It is also clear from the work on st ereotyping and from psychoanalytic approaches to racism that a -philia can rapidly switch into a -phobia (Gilman 2013). Again, we do not delve into the psychological, cul tural, sociostructural 1 The culturally constructed yet crucial categories 'black' and 'whit e' will not be put in quotation marks or beg in with a capital letter on the following pages (unless there is a context of identity politics and emphatic cultural pride among protagonists), but they sho uld nonetheless be read as highly debated, unstable signifiers (with real -world references and effe cts in experiences, identities and politics), not as 'neutral,' sociological denominations. Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 1 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 3 and economic explanations of such ambiguities here.2 It should be kept in mind, however, that racism and Afro -Americanophilia are closely interdependent, and they are often hard to separate. In surveying Afro -Americanophilia we give snapshots of the published research that touches on black presences, real and imagined, in Germany and in German -speaking lands and cultures.3 It should be clear that in selecting the literature we draw from, our decisions on inclusion and exclusion are c ontingent and debatable. We have been guided both by our perception of the field, which takes up different areas of social, cultural and intellectual history, and by our own joint research inte rests that are \u2014as the second survey essay makes clear \u2014particula rly strong in the area of popular music. The article thus takes up prominent examples of Afro -Americanophilia from the areas of everyday aesthetics, popular music, political organizations, and to som e extent literature and advertising, but pays relatively little attention to classical music, painting, theology, sports, theatre, film, and reportage. Those areas must be covere d in future work. Still, in drawing these many strains together in the following sect ions, we attempt to sketch the outlines of a more complete picture. While our main interest is in practices of Afro -Americanophilia, focussing on the actors is equally important. This im mediately poses questions of agency and about the beneficiaries of Afro -Americanophilia. Who is active in Afro -American ophilia, and in what ways, and what are the effects of that agency? The main focus of this survey will be on the 'lover' side of the equation, the white Afro -Americanophiles, but \u2014without attempting to write a history of African Americans, black people in G ermany, or Black Germans \u2014we also inquire into the ways in which some of the people who are the objects of that love have reac ted to (and sometimes suffered under) the expectations levied upon them, or have been able to engage with the demand for 'black cul tural traffic.' In the first sections of this paper, we stress a few salient aspects of real and imagined presences in pre -modern times, so as to identify some potentially long -lasting themes and discontinuities, before approaching the late nineteenth cent ury where a modern dispositif of racial meanings takes shape. 2 Theoretical approaches are treated more extensively in Ege (2007). 3 'German speaking lands and cultures' refers both to the time before the German nation -state ( 1871), as well as to Austria and Switzerland (a few sources rel ate to these German -speaking countries). We do not refer to the history of these latter countries in their ent irety, however. Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 1 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 4 A pre -history A pre -history of 20th century Afro -Americanophilia can be found in ambivalently 'positive' figures that arose among Germans in representations of the Crusades, and of the lives of certain Christian saints and so -called Hofmohren [court Moors, that is subjects from North Africa and Islamicized Spain], as well as other exceptional individuals such as the philosopher Anton Wilhelm Amo (Gilman 1982; Martin Kuhlmann 2013).4 A few basic points about the changing attitudes to black people and the idea of blackness before the 19th century are pertinent to later forms of Afro -Americanophilia in Germany. For instance, the historian Peter Martin di scerns in the 16th and 17thth centuries an 'afrophile' tendency within the aristocracy, for whom the figure of the Moor represente d an advanced and wealthy 'oriental' culture (2001: 12). Black people were sought out as s ervants who could give their masters the opportunity to associate themselves with a signifier of luxury and to create an 'oriental' mise-en-sc\u00e8ne in their everyday life. As a mode of appropriating and exhibiting otherness, these orientalist forms shared some features with 18th century elite tastes for Chinoisierie or Japonerie: Black people figured as exotic and as signs of luxury. At the same time, of course, white aristocrats exerted their dominance over people of colour, both practically and symbolically.5 The history of European preconc eptions of black people devolved from the figure of the in-some -ways -sophisticated Mohr to that of the radically inferior ' Neger ' (Negro). 'Enlightened' anthropological speculations in the late -18th century and the scientific racial theories of the 19th century were more unambiguously negative than earlier ways of thinking.6 As Peter Martin puts it, by approximately 1830 \u2014that is, by the time the bourgeois society ceased to be simp ly a theoretical concept \u2014... all of the central elements had emerged that co ntinue to determine the image of Africans amongst many Germans to this day. Blacks were largely regarded as being incontrovertibly foreign and demonic, as being creatures of their drives and vices, as being without 4 According to historians, black people who lived in Germany befor e the late 19th century can be numbered in the thousands only. It should be noted that the late 17th century was th e time when the Kur - Brandenburg (later Prussia) established a Brandenburg Gold Coast colony in today's Ghana. This colony remained in Branden burg hands until the 1720s. Partly with this era of European colonialism in mind, the German anthropologist Karl -Heinz Kohl (1987) has written about white European 'cul tural defectors' who attempted to leave behind their home cultures. B efore the 18th cent ury, Kohl argues, such 'defectors' were mostly members of the underclasses. 5 In a slightly different sense, gypsy masquerades, popul ar in courts and the theatre, allowed the masqueraders to mimic a supposedly more free (but, in r eality, harshly oppressed) group and at the same time condemn its way of life as inferior and dangerous (B ogdal 2011). 6 On scientific racism in Germany, see Pyenson (1985) and especially Smith (1991). Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 1 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 5 culture, reason and history, as being peo ple with an animalistic embodiment and childlike behaviour. (2001: 13, our translation) As historians of racism have pointed out, such ideas served an importa nt function in the context of slavery and modern colonialism of legitimizing exploitation and dehumanization. Within this context of the intellectual systematizat ion of racism in the 19th century, modern 'Black cultural traffic' begins. For German -speaking audiences, the first large -scale exposure to Africans in North American slavery was mediated t hrough Harriet Beecher Stowe's sentimental -romantic abolitionist novel Uncle Tom's Cabin , which was published in German translation in 1852. The book was widely read, and as various sources suggest it preci pitated a pattern of emotional identification and imagination among thousands of white German readers. Numerous imitative songs, poetry, and plays soon followed, creating a veritable Onkel - Tom-Industrie [Uncle Tom Industry] (Paul 2002, 2005; Broeck 2011). However, there is little to suggest a deeper inter est in, let alone fascination or love for, the American 'Negro' or her/his culture at that time.7 Rather, the German reception of Beecher Stowe's book demonstrates how new world slavery primarily figured as a metaphor for old world, class - and sometimes ge nder-based social injustices, and as a stage for white hero or saviour figures, in a discourse that would prove to be long -lasting.8 Colonial and Jim -Crow era Subsequent German demand for (US) 'Black cultural traffic' arose during the post - reconstruction , Jim Crow era in the USA, at the same time that Germany became a colonial power.9 This phase roughly coincides with Kennell Jackson's periodization in 7 There was a significant enough faction among German -Americans in the 1840s an d 1850s that was strongly opposed to slavery and white supremacy for Fr edrick Douglass to claim that 'a German has only to be a German to be utterly opposed to slavery. In feeling , as well as in conviction and principle, they are antislavery' (Levine 1998 : 56. See also Honeck 2011; Strickland 2011). This was , of course, a huge exaggeration, but the left -wing German -American anti -slavery faction was strong. Indeed numerous failed 1848 revolutionaries emigrated to the USA and became vocal abolitionists. Many German \u00e9migr\u00e9s volunteered for Lincoln's Civil War army. Particularly significant abolitionist activists included Ottilie Assing, who was Fredrick Douglass's collaborator, lover and translator (Diederich 1999). However, the overall tendency among German -American authors in the 19th century can be described as an increasing allegiance to whiteness, as literary scholar Heike Paul (2005) argues. This attitude is largely analogous to that of other Western and Central European immigrant gro ups in the USA. 8 From the early 19th century Germans employed a discursive rhetoric to cont rast their own fate (as 'free' white people) with that of slaves. Like other Europe ans, they often referred to their birthright as white people to be free from slavery, as opposed to b lack people of African descent, whom God had supposed ly placed in a lower position (Paul 2002: 29). 9 From the mid -1880s until the mid 1910s --WWI and the end of the Kaiserreich [German Empire] -- Germany held territories on the African continent inc luding la rge areas around what are now Togo, Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 1 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 6 which the time between the 1890s and the 1920s is characterized by 'intens e [Black] cultural traffic' (2 005: 20).10 Many aspects of later racial iconography, semantics and thought, as well as a structural coloniality of knowledge and power are rooted in 19th century (and earlier) colonialism.11 It was also during this era of intense urbanization and industrial ization that modern mass culture began to emerge and would evolve to have a key role in the mediation of Afro -Americanophilia, as David Ciarlo (2011) has shown in his work on racial iconography in German advertising culture. In this context, Schaulust [Freud's scopophilia] became an increasingly important mode of relating to the world (Gilman 1985; Hall 2013). The exhibition of c olonial 'others,' which displayed the spectacle of race and difference as a discours e of 'civilizational' hierarchy, infused wit h curiosity and desire, developed into mainstays of mass culture and advertising (McClintock 1995; Bechhaus ent entrepreneurs, sometimes aided by anthropologists, created V\u00f6lkerschauen [shows of peoples] or V\u00f6lkerausstellungen [exhibitions of peoples] that featured scenes of life in far -away lands, including African and Asian colonies. This fulfilled an apparent mass desire for 'foreign,' especially black bodies that were put on display in order to be observed and, sometimes, t ouched.12 Concurrently, older European folk culture like carnival also became i nfused with colonial themes and with performances of racial difference and domination, including re-enactments of colonial wars (Bausinger 2005: 77; Kramer 2012: 193ff). S uch grass - roots instantiations of German imperialism illustrate that eve n genocidal colonial war could be turned into participatory entertainment 'at home,' and folded into the traditional carnivalesque pleasure of transgression via costumes, ma sks, and paint. This was not Afro -Americanophilia, of course, as neither Schaulust nor carnival Cameroon, Rwanda, Burundi, as well as Deutsch -Ostafrika (German East Africa, now Tanzania) and Deutsch -S\u00fcdwestafrika (German Southwest Africa, now Namibia). 10 Jackson (2005) also stresses that in comparison with th e peri od between the 1840s and 1880s there was a growing emancipation from the 'plantation show formula' among African American artists, including traveling singing groups. 11 There is an extensive literature on German colonialism , and its prehistory and legacies : Zantop (1997); 12 About 400 V\u00f6lkerausstellungen troupes toured Germany between 1875 and 1930; some p erformers self-confidently fought for their own interests; a few also h ad liaisons with white Germans (Drees bach 2005: 240). On attempts to reconstruct their lives see Poignant (2004). Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 1 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 7 performances document anything reminiscent of love. That sai d, scopophilic events such as the V\u00f6lkerausstellungen did become enmeshed in erotic and fetishistic desires, and discourses about those events form another important German prehistor y of more recent Afro -Americanophilia.13 In a more general sense, sexualiz ed fears of boundary crossing, contagion and degeneration \u2014also crucial for 19th-century anti -Semitism \u2014shaped colonial -era racial discourse from the beginning. The idea of transformation, of cultural defection, of 'becoming black,' loomed large within the w hite German colonial cultural imaginary. Questions of interracial desire and miscegenation were intertwi ned in colonial discourse with the motif of Verkafferung [Kaffirization] and later Vernegerung [Negroization], racist terms that were used, in the begin ning, to express disdain for less respectable, lower -class (white) German settlers who appeared to escape the disc ipline of European colonial life and succumb to the purported lure of native tended not to sexualize the African female Other, as much as, say, the French counterpart (Ciarlo 2011: 99 -101). Intimate personal relations between colonizers and colonized persons c onfronted the German colonial administration and the parliament at home with practical, legal and intellectual challenges: how to manage marriage rights and, most pr essingly, the citizenship of spouses and interracial children? Could there be black Germans? In order to deny the existence of the latter, the empire instituted ius sanguinis laws of citizenship that cast a long shadow beyond the actual demise of the colonies (Reic the few hundred colonial migrants \u2014mostly from today's Cameroon \u2014posed similar questions within Germany (Aitken & Rosenhaft 2013).15 Some socialists (notably Rosa Luxemburg) and Christian groups opposed colonialism on political and humanitarian grounds, but anti -colonialism did not become a popular movement before Germany lost its colonies. On the contrary, its support grew over time. In its later phase, even within the political (Social Democrat) opposition to the imperial government , most Germans supported colonialism as a benign civilizing missio n. 13 On racial fetishism see Mercer (2013). 14 On these biopolitical resonances see the classic study by Stoler (1995). 15 The 'loss' of the German colonies in the period 1914 -1918 did not stop colonial subjects from the erstwhile colonies coming to Germany. Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 1 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 8 Concurrently, Jim -Crow -era popular culture from the USA \u2014especially post -bellum minstrelsy \u2014also began to reach continental Europe.16 Numerous African American musicians toured western and central Europe around the turn of the cent ury, performing mostly i n Vari\u00e9t\u00e9 theatres in cities and towns, and enjoying a certain amount of freedom in the process, as the discographer and historian Rainer Lotz has s hown.17 The social and cultural meanings of minstrelsy in the USA are hotly debated, es pecially since Eric Lott (1996) argued that its performative dimensions of masking and play i nvolved not only ridicule and disdain, but also a carnevalesque combination of 'love and theft.' In Germany, literary scholar Jonathan Wipplinger argues that fin-de-si\u00e8cle blackface performances --acted by whites and blacks --marked an important and long -lasting 'point of discursive confluence, by which popular culture was constructed a s both black and American' (2011: 459). This image reworked Germany's new colonial s tatus, which meant th at the presence of black people had to be acknowledged in a new way, as did the contemporary geopolitical rise of the USA and the high phase of ur ban, capitalist modernity. The blackface image created 'a unique situat ion in which significant spillage could (and did) occur between the discourse of Africa and blackness and that of America and African Americans' (2011: 460). This Amer icanized the pre - existing racial stereotype of the 'Neger.' Because blackface coul d pose questions of racial difference, America n modernity, and the grotesque, it 'function[ed] as a nodal point of societal uncertainty in late -nineteenth century Germany' (Wipplinger 2011: 458). Within commercial culture the influence of minstrelsy was decisive, overwriting earlier colonial iconograp hy with more evidently racialized images, an effect that was to be long lasting (Ciarlo 2011). Continuing this pattern, the turn of the nineteenth century saw a global c raze for the 'Cakewalk,' an African American dance that, in its original cont ext, mimi cked and parodied the formal dances of upper -class Southern whites. Black and white blackface minstrels danced the Cakewalk and early film, visual representati ons and sheet music facilitated the spread of the craze too. In Germany, as historia n Astrid Kuss er (2012 ) points out in her important monograph, the Cakewalk was seen as a humor ous, contemporary, and modern cultural form. The 'primitive,' which we e xplore below in 16 Antebellum minstrelsy, from the 1830s on, may have been the ' first Atlantic popular culture' (Lhamon 2003), but it hardly reached continental Europe. On Great Britain, see Pickeri ng (2008). 17 For example, approximately one hundred black people performed in Germany in 1896, alongside a large number of white and Historicizing 1 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 9 our treatment of the Weimar era, was not the master signifier here. Racial stereotypes about the 'Neger' and binary oppositions about white and black certainly pla yed a role, but the cultural practice of reception had other aspects, Kusser argues. Most importantly, people danced the Cakewalk with many also having their pictures taken in 'gro tesque' Cakewalk poses. For a history of Afro -Americanophilia and its practical forms, its subjects, and its media, it is important to note the shift in prevalent modes of engagement. The Cakewalk was the first of many such dance fashions or 'crazes' that were a matter of mimetic bodily experiences, of physical moveme nts and a different way of experiencing the dancing Self. In contrast to older phenomena, this was not solely a matter of visual or aural spectacle, or of imaginary 'identification' (Kusser 200 8, 2012). Such turn -of-the century engagements with blackness and with African American cultural forms in Germany have for a long time been overlooked in the writing of cultural history, and recent interdisciplinary scholarship has done impor tant work in reconstructing them. There is a strong case for considering blacknes s a crucial component of turn -of-the-19th-century German popular culture, and the case strengthens once other types of images and texts are taken into account, such as a nthropological and travel writings or philosophical texts in which ideas of the so -called primitive figured prominently, providing the contrast for European ideas of culture and civi lization. The reach of racialized advertisements and depictions in illustrated ne wspapers was also significant. At the same time, it must be noted that blackface represented only one of several popular culture novelties at the same time, and was not the dominant one for 'society as such,' or even for definable subcultures or age groups.18 German na tionalism and identity were defined at the time to a large extent through anti -Semitism, and the attempt to better understand the relationship between these forms of racism should not downplay the importance of anti -Semitism. We must then be careful not to overstate the case. At the time, most Germans' exposure to actual Black Di asporic culture was very limited, and personal contact even more so, as temporary guests li ke W. E. B. Du Bois, who studied in Berlin in the early 1890s, noted.19 18 One could also cite, for example, the enthusiasm fo r the Wild West and for 'Red Indians,' as demonstrated by the popularity of Wild West shows and Karl May's novels (Kocks 2004; Kort & Hollein 2006; Penny 2013), of late -18th-century 'Indomania' in Buddhist -inspired theosophy and the fin -de-si\u00e8cle Lebensreform (life reform) movement, a more up -scale preoccupation (McGetchin 2009). 19 See Beck (1996); Hopkins (1998); Bechhaus -Gerst (2005); Edwards (2006). See also the standard biography of Du Bois by Levering Lewis (1993).

Racial ideologies we re cemented in ways that seemed to justify colonialism and colonial wars (Gilman Still, in a way that presaged the future, there were some moments where abstract questions of white -Germanness and American blackness became confused, particularly in the register of the grotesque and via corporeal experience, as in th e Cakewalk craze. Weimar: 'N\u00e9grophilie' [negrophilia] and transnational migrancy The Weimar Republic, a somewhat out -of-joint era between 1919 and 1933, saw dramatic political and cultural conflict and transformation. It coincided with a high phase of a rtistic modernism in Europe and the USA, early blues and jazz in the USA, the Harlem and other Renaissances, and the cultural theme of n\u00e9grophilie in France, as well as a larger interest in what Europeans continued to regard as the 'primitive.' Afro - Americ anophilia (using the term retrospectively) was quite pronounced during the Weimar era as well, in terms of its extent and the novel for ms it took.20 During World War I, Germany lost its colonies (which were taken ove r by other European powers), and after the defeat in the European War, the country became an unstable parliamentary democracy. In the process, one durable German m yth of blackness emerged. In German East Africa, the German Reich wa s able, with assistance from colonial troops, to hold out until 1918 against the Allies. The assistance of those troops gave rise to the trope of the 'loyal Askari,' which remained in place during the Weimar era and thereafter and came into contact with other portr ayals of blackness (Mass 1919 and 1920, other racist anti -black representations flooded German visual culture as conservatives becam e scandalized by the presence of French African colonial soldiers in the Rhineland. This discourse was often braided with mourning over Germ any's loss of its colonies. Yet it was also set against a backdrop of broader white European anxieties about the 'decline of the west,' fed by contemporaneous socialist and communist revolutions, and by colonial upri sings (Martin 1996, 2004a, 2004b). The R hineland occupation seemed to have reversed the 20 On Negrophilia duri ng this Black renaiss ances beyond the well -know n Harlem example, see Jackson (2005).

Campaigners used crassly racist i mages of black people as hardly human savages or apes in their appeal to white European solidarity against what they termed die schwarze Schmach ['the Black Disgrace' or 'the Black they foregrounded the spectre of black soldie rs raping white German women, or of women having sexual re lations of any sort with colonial soldiers, insinuating both symbolic national 'disgrace' and racial degradation, sinc e their 'mixed - race' children would 'pollute' German blood (Campt 2005: 100).21 In a twist, anti - Semitic, racist German nationalists regard ed Jewish conspirators to be the real forces behind the presence of black soldiers.22 The sexualization of race is critical. Throughout the 20th century, many Germans, particularly though not exclusively those on the political right, regarded any black pres ence that was not deferential and asexual as a threat to national culture and to the collective body of the Volk.23 On the other end of the spectrum \u2014but by no means disarticulated from the conservative discourse --'blackness' became an important, positivel y connoted signifier within an urban, hedonistic, and cosmopolitan -oriented culture. So -called Negrophilie [negrophilia] manifested itself in music, literature, visual c ulture, dress and dance. The German phenomenon was a transposition, to some degree, of the (larger) French n\u00e9grophilie phenomenon. In Paris, African American intellectuals and artist s mingled with migrants from French colonies in Africa and the Caribbean, w here other Black modern 'renaissances' were taking places, creating a highly producti ve crucible not only for modernist art and anti -colonial political thought, but also for an urban entertainment culture.24 Practices such as going out to listen and dance to jazz, putting on ' African' jewelry and clothing, adorning the home with masks and ot her 'racial' items, or going to themed parties, bars, and cabarets, provided access to what people considered black or generically African culture.25 What started as the prerogative of a few, upper -class or bohemian city -dwellers soon 'trickled down ' to the popular world and to more provincial regions via advertising, visual culture, recorded music (a novelty) and touring 21 See also Pommerin (1979); Koller (2001); Mass (2006); Wigger the confluence of anti -Black and anti -Semitic racism, see Haehnel (2010). 23 On conservative German anti -black racism in debat es about mass and/or popular culture, see Maase (1997: 175ff). 24 Berlin's Negrophilie came somewhat later and never matched Paris (Lotz 20 04: 256). On German Negrophilie see Hopkins (2011); on French n\u00e9grophilie see Archer -Straw (2000) and Shack (2001). 25 As before African and African American imagery w ere semiotically conflated, partly due to a lack of adequate musical and sociocultural knowledge (Lotz 2004: 259) .

Some performers \u2014 most famously Josephine Baker \u2014even became household names (Nenno 1997; Archer - Straw 2000). Musically, ragtime gave way to jazz, which was the s oundtrack to fashionable new dances like the Charleston, Shimmy and Foxtrot, and bec ame a symbol of Weimar era culture in the course of the 1920s (Lotz 1997; 2004; cultur e had themselves become themes for German cultural criticism f rom the 1910s (Jelavich 1993: 174 anti -black racism and Negrophilia did not exclude each other here. They might have been contradictory, but at the same time they were mutually constitutive. For example, a backlash of racist opposition and legal bat tles over supposedly 'un -German' performances made Negrophilia more risqu\u00e9, perhaps even oppositional. A 1929 performance in Munich by Josephin e Baker was, for instance, banned by local police because of the supposed threat to public decency posed by the 'negro -naked -dancer.' Sexuality was at the core of such sentiments. For Negrophi les and opponents alike there was a chain of equivalence where t ransgressing sexual propriety articulated with transgressing racial boundaries.27 Hence, in some crucial ways, Negrophilia itself retained the racial dichotomy of black physicalit y and white intellectuality (Weiner 1991; \u2014a major cultural theme of the 1920s \u2014under - scored this dichotomy. Many artists and psychoanalysts (among others) belie ved that 'civilized' Westerners might find less repressed ways of life within their own inner 26 For example, entertainment venues like Haus Vaterland in Berlin, famously dissected by Sie gfried Kracauer, provided popular forms of 'formatted exoti cism' for the new, white -collar class (Nagl 2009: 732). As Siegfried Mattl notes, according to a survey from 1920s Vienna, young blue and white collar workers were the main audience for jazz on the radio, and the Catholic church was its most vocal opponent (2008: 86). 27 See for example Klaus Mann's Mephisto , and other literary texts to which Marc Weiner (1991) refers in his study of jazz in Weimar era literature. This is also a theme in the 1922 ent ertainment novel Das blaue Mal [The Blue Mark] by Viennese author Hugo Brettauer, which was influenced by W. E. B. DuBois's writings, and features a Viennese dandy of Af rican heritage who emigrates to the USA and foresees an inevitable 'racial war.' Siegfr ied Mattl ultimately interprets this Americanism] as an example of 'popular modernism' an d, more concretely, of a 'new utopia of a liberal Viennese Jew in the context of virulent anti -Semitism and aborted Jewish emancipation in Cent ral Europe' (2008: 87). Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 1 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 13 desires and drives , but also within 'primitive' societies or 'races.' Some sought access to such layers through cultural forms like jazz, or via avant -garde art practice, and in some cases through ethnography.28 Generally, Negrophilia sat within this wider pre - occupation wit h primitivism in its many hues. Nonetheless, the engagement of art ists with it could be comparatively self -reflexive, and open to irony.29 As an example, Josephine Baker famously played to the expectation of 'primitiveness' a nd with racializing images. In s ome of her German performances she would dance before a grotesquely caricatured image of her body. She would attempt to replic ate the pose, with intentionally humorous effects that could only challenge the racial izing expectations of her audiences (Ciarlo 2011: 322). Primitivism was not the only way of approaching African -American culture. Other ways of thinking about jazz used it as a catalyst for thinking about political struggles in the USA and elsew here.30 And as the francophone N\u00e9gritude movement showed , primitivist discourse could also be re - worked into a means of empowerment by anti -colonial Black intellectuals. A few thousand black people (mostly from the former colonies) are known to have lived in Germany in the 1920s, most of them under precarious conditions, and their history is now being researched extensively ( Oguntoye 1997; Aitken & Rosenhaft 2013; Rosenhaft & Aitken 2013) .31 In the inter -war era, European cities became nodes in the transatlantic, transnational network of diasporic travel, trade and communication: A 'transnational dialectics between colonial migrants, blacks born in Germany and black U.S. Americans' was set in motion (Nagl 2009: 639). Indeed, between the late nineteenth century and the 1930s, a Black German community began to for m. We 28 See, for example, Carl Einstein's engagement with sub -Saharan African sculpture during the 1910s (Gilman 1982; Fleckner 2006). On jazz and primitivism, especially in the French context, see Gioia (1988). The history of ethnographi c surrealism is a slightly different, but related phenomenon (on this, see Clifford 1981; Nettelbeck 2004: 110 -114). On 'primitivism' directed at rural German farmers, ' deviant' groups and the 'lower' levels of the psyche, see Warneken (2006: 17 -89). Jacks on's periodization (2005) of global Black cultural traffic mainly situates primitivism be fore the 1920s, but it certainly was an important feature of German Negrophilia at that time. 29 An element of self -reflexivity, but also, possibly, condescension, was evident, for example in the neologism 'negern' [to Negro -ise], which was coined to refer to fashion, art collection, and carnivalesque transgression practices (see Martin & Alonzo 2004: 352). On how the Weimar era image of the 'funny savage' could allow a 'theatre of irony,' see Ciarlo (2011: 321 -322). 30 Tobias Nagl observes that in some cases, such as Vik tor Klages and Viktor Trivas, jazz was seen as a medium through which various political and cultural e mancipatory movements could be communicated to Germa n audiences (2009: 667). Marc Weiner (1991) also attr ibutes a more nuanced reading and portrayal of jazz culture to Herman Hesse in his novel Steppenwolf . 31 Some sojourners' biographies \u2014Josephine Baker, Louis Douglas, Sidney Bechet \u2014are well known; others, like those of Mohamed Husen and Louis Brody, have bee n reconstructed as well (Nagl 2002, 2012; Bechhaus -Gerst 2007) . Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 1 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 14 cannot delve into this important social history here, however crucial que stions arise about the relationship between black people in Germany and Negrophilia. How did it have an impact on their lives? And how did they influence the cultural formation? These people worked in a variety of jobs, including as language assist ants, small business owners, merchants, servants, manual laborers and craftspe ople. However performing in show business was particularly important and, for many, it became a survival s trategy. Various factors were at play including the economics of Ger man colonial nostalgia.32 However, Negrophilia created an increased demand for black American culture and quite a few Africans toured as 'American' musicians. (Here the term Afro -Americanop hilia seems better than the more diffuse Negrophilia.) Some were able to make careers that even spanned decades (Aitken & Rosenhaft 2013) . Employment and relatively good pay were available in the film industry, but most individuals had little or no artisti c control over their typecasting. Others were waiters in themed Negerbars [Negro Bars]. They too performed to a demand for blackness and black culture, that is to the collective expectations of (white) patrons, and to micro -level demands from managers, dir ectors, and others. Stars like Josephine Baker enjoyed more individual and artistic autonomy. Among black people in Germany, however, there were also attempts at poli tical self - organization. Although some colonial migrants accommodated themselves t o the mood of colonial nostalgia and the image of the 'loyal Askari,' many dem anded recognition as Black Germans . Black entrepreneurs founded associations to protect their interests , for example. In Hamburg, a short -lived Afrikanischer Hilfsverein [African Assis tance in the Communist Internati onal's attempt to unite its own struggles with those of the colonized, by way of Hambu rg's Internationales Workers] (Aitken & Rosenhaft 2013).33 These histories indicate that despite the precarity of citizenship Black German agency was far from hamstrung. There were also 'hidden transcripts' \u2014anthropologist James Scott's term for lived experience and the col lective knowledge it produces (1990) \u2014behind performances to 32 On colonial nostalgia in Weimar Germany, see: Schmoke l (1964), Ames, Klotz & Wildenthal (2005), and Mass (2006). 33 Under the auspices of this organization, Willi M\u00fcnzenberg and George Padmore pu blished the Negro Worker magazine between 1928 and 1933, using Hamburg's port as a base for international distribution (Martin 2004; Aitken & Rosenhaft 2013). Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 1 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 15 Negrophile expectations. For instance, Tobias Nagl argues that whils t Negerbars were 'establishments, where [white patrons] could consume race in a danger -free setting, [they] simultaneously also represented important crystallization points in the Black German Alltag ' (2009: 733; our translation) Contesting audience expectations, and devising practical strategies for survival, dignity and recognition \u2014in short, a degree of agency \u2014are very much part of the story of Afro -Americanophilia, even though they are hard to reconstruct. The Weimar era was marked by a Negrophile tendency, of which Afro -Americanophilia was a significant part, and by the extreme racism that surface d in the Rhineland occupation discourse and the rising Nazi movement. Negrophilia enabled and constrained employment strategies and subjectivities of Black Germa ns and other black people in Germany. The process involved people and the power relations betwe en them, not just discourses a nd cultural forms. Conservative opposition to Negrophilia stemmed from both v\u00f6lkisch [racial] German nationalism, as well as from anxieties a bout the fate of Europe and from fixed gender ideas. Negrophilia, in practical ter ms, took the form of cultural rec eption, mimetic practices and consumption. Black cultural forms we re made accessible and consumable through the new media of film and recorded musi c. As with the earlier Cakewalk craze, they could take the carnivalesque form of corporeal, physical experien ces of dancing, dressing up and feeling immersed. These tended to be momentary entertainments for white Germans, rather than longer -standing engagements and forms of self -fashioning in milieus or subcultures. Advertising and visual culture further meant th at Negrophile images had a large reach. In its content, 1920s Negrophilia was ambiguous. It could accommodate both primitivism and an image of futuristic American modernity, and sometimes self - reflective irony. Despite some exceptions, most cultural text s regarded black and white as polar opposites. Blackness was understood as a 'racial' essence that was radica lly different and, at best, complementary to the ethos of contemporary white Europe: It was taken to embody what white Europe had repressed and ove rcome. In that regard, the basic semiotic structure of much 1920s primitivism was actually m ore radically binary than some earlier versions of the imagined black/white relation. In leftist politics, the Weimar era saw a new, transnational paradigm of strat egic communist worker solidarity, but on a rather small scale. Here, too, black people were often sought out as blacks , Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 1 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 16 although not for the cultural reasons we have examined here, but rather in the context of a global geopolitical strategy and anti -capita list politics. The categorical exclusion of black people from German society continued both legally and discursively during the Weimar era, and pre -empted what was to come. Indeed, the forced sterilization of Black Germans --particularly of the 600 -800 ch ildren of French African colonial soldiers --was mooted as early as 1927, although it was only carried out in the subsequent Nazi era (Campt 2005: 84; Pommerin 1979). As early as 1931, the conservative (yet pre -Nazi) national government announced that there were to be no more stage performances by African Americans (Nagl 2009: 670; Partsc h 2000: 218). Similar piecemeal bans (of jazz music, for instance) soon fol lowed on different levels, even though they were not always followed and the situation on the grou nd was more complicated than those bans might suggest (Schr \u00f6der 1988; Nagl 2009: 744). The Nazi era The Nazi era saw the sharpening of racist discourse, with, for instance, racial science beginning to be taught in schools. There were also very practical consequences, with legal and administrative action taken in relation to African -Americans and black people more broadly. This era transformed the v\u00f6lkisch nationalist rhetoric into state policy and state-promulgated violence, which would have dire effects for the group of colonial migrants, black people born in Germany and visiting African -Americans (Samples Black performers and individuals were subjected to restrictions of various ki nds, with most being denied entry or being deported after 1933 (Lewerenz 2006; Nagl 2009: 744; Aitken & Rosenhaft 2013). Black communists and their supporters were f orced into migration , or were interned (Martin 2004), as were others, without political reasons . The forced sterilization of the Afro -German children born during the occupation of the Rhineland has already been mentioned. While there was no consistent policy of killing all black people in Germany during the Nazi era, some black people were m urdered in concentration camps. Furthermore, the government criminalized inter racial relationships by forbidding marriages and it tried to force people out of the country. A few hundred Black Germans lived through the Nazi years and the war, but the community that had 34 On the Nazi racial state generally, se e Burleigh and Wippermann (1991). Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 1 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 17 begun to form before the Nazi era disappeared. A few black entrepreneurs and performers resorted to forming the Deutsche Afrika -Schau [German Africa Show], a travelling troupe that functioned in the tradition of colonial exhibitions (Lewerenz 2006; Aitken & Rosenhaft 2013) . The government supported the Afrika -Schau for some time and forced a number of black people in Germany to join it as a means of keeping them under surveillan ce and control. Here, performance really was a last resort for survival. Discursively, a brief curtailment of overt racism occurred during the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, where the African American track runner Jess e Owen was welcomed enthusiastically by the crowd and the regime attempted to show a friendly fa\u00e7ade to the international audience. However, this episode had no long -term impact (Gassert 1997: 193). Building on the earlier tradition of Anti -Americanism, Nazi -era ideological writings about the USA at once scandalized 'race -mixing' and predicted the downfall of the USA because of its ethnic heterogeneity. Some authors also appeal ed to white solidarity in the Global North (Gassert 1997: 240). But there were odd c ontradictions. It is striking that the Nazi press, despite its conspicuous anti -black racism, used segregation and lynchings in the USA to accuse that country of hypocrisy. I n the view of these authors, integrated, multiracial societies simply could not function; black people had to be opp ressed and any professed liberal values were a sham. Nazi ideologues continued to rail against African -American art forms, and jazz was again a particular focus now deemed to be a dangerously sexual music. T hat is, it could undermine the gender -sex order and thus the nation and particularly the morality of 'Aryan' women. They also revived the anti -Semitic Nationalist idea of Neger -Juden - Jazz [Negro -Jew-Jazz] as part of a Jewish -propagated plot. Jazz even became an aural equivalent of miscegenation: Indeed some ideologues, here the National Socialist ideologue Richard Litterscheid, regarded jazz as pernicious precisely because it was a Mischprodukt [hybrid product] ( quoted in Hoffmann 1996: 99) . Rhetorical parries were met with administrative action, as med ia outlets and performance venues were subjected to piecemeal restrictions on the broadcast and performance of swing a nd jazz Kater (2003) has s hown, the situation on the ground was more complex. Ideological battles were fought out between the reactiona ry v\u00f6lkisch wing and more pragmatic voices within the Nazi Party; but it was recognized that there Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 1 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 18 was a need for modern, light entertainment dance music. In this context, swing -like music was rebadged as 'German Dance and Entertainment music.' What, then, of Negrophilia and Afro -Americanophilia during the Nazi era? The fad did not suddenly dissipate by decree. Afro -Americanophile jazz culture even existed in the concentration camps. Some internees performed for their own enter tainment or, at other times, at the beck and call of camp staff ( Schumann 1998; Fackler 2000; Peitzmeier 2013) . In less extreme circumstances, some young people continued to s avour jazz and swing dancing in German cities, their interest sustained by foreign broadcasting, the inherent unpoliceability of music, as well as by privately owned and c irculated recordings. The so -called Swing -Jugend [swing youth] informal groups compri sed largely of middle -class young people, resisted the regime's attempts to co -opt youth within the banner of the Hitler -Jugend [Hitler Youth] and the Bund Deutscher M\u00e4del [Association of German Girls].35 Many young Germans thus found themselves at loggerhe ads with the regime ( Kater 1994, 2003; Barber -Kersovan & Uhlmann 2002) . Many individuals were subjected to chicanery in the process; some we re incarcerated in concentration camps for failing to toe the line. However, Kater ( 2003) is somewhat sceptical abou t the extent to which sych subcultural practices with their musica l and stylistic Afro -Americanophilia articulated with pre -existing resistance to the regime. He also points out that there were Swing and jazz enthusiasts who could a ccommodate an interest i n African -American culture with right -wing ideological convictions. Proximity and moral Afro -Americanophilia in Postwar West Germany After the 1945 defeat (or liberation) of Germany and the consequent occupa tion by the Allied powers, most Germans' ideolo gical and cultural allegiances seemed to shift rapidly, at least among the younger generation. In that process, blacknes s figured in complicated ways and Afro -Americanophilia \u2014now clearly dominant over a more general Negrophilia toward black people \u2014became a n important, one could argue foundational, cultural theme in both East and West Germany. The post -Nazi era in West Germany provided its citizens with the liberties of a (somewhat) liberal democracy, strategically tied to the US . Globally, newly founded sup ranational organizations 35 The importance of African American references is document ed anecdotally in autobiographical narratives. In one source, a group of jazz fans in Essen in 1938 recor ded a song called 'Harlem,' which one protagonist retrospe ctively describes as a 'holy' artefact among his high s chool classmates 'a worldview' ( eine ). Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 1 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 19 including the UN and UNESCO sought to counter racism and the category of 'race' as such (Broeck 2011: 129). Discussions of blackness in 1950s and 1960s Germany were increasingly attentive to the changing fate of African Americans a nd the US Civil Rights Movement. But interest in blackness, black people and black cult ure also related to a broader 'historical optimism' (Jackson 2005: 22) about decolonization, spurred on by such events as the Afro -Asian Bandung conference in 1955, and the independence of numerous African states in the 1950s and early 1960s. This surge of int erest was embedded in wider developments and cannot be regarded as a German phenomenon alone: Jackson (2005) sees the time between the mid -1940s and the mid -1960s as the first of two globally resonant postwar phases that were qualitative ly and quantitatively significantly more 'crowded' with 'Black cultural traffic ' than earlier decades. In the West of Germany, occupation by the USA, France and the UK me ant that real and mediated engagement with African Americans greatly increased. African Americans were crucial to the great cultural -political topic of the time, Americanization , which, as historian Kaspar Maase (1992) points out, primarily mea nt African - Americanizatio n for many young German people. The images and sounds of African America were mediated via newly accessible film and popular broa dcast media, including the American Forces Network, and the US cultural industrie s played a pivotal role throughout. The US adm inistration promoted Amerikah\u00e4user [American Cultural Institutes] as well as American Studies programs in some Ger man universities, within which African American Studies began to play a significant role ( Haselstein & Ostendorf 2005; Boesenberg 2011) . For m any who lived in the Western zones, the experience of liberation and occupation was connected with a new and unexpe cted experience of proximity with African Americans (and, in a lesse r way, with black French and British soldiers). In today's popular iconog raphy, images of friendly African American soldiers passing out chewing gum to children stand as metonyms for the entire era, but what is less often said is that such images im plicitly gained their meaning and heft from the stark contrast with Nazi propaga nda of 'savage' black rapists. Returned POWs held in the USA between 1942 and 1946 often also had their ow n positive experiences of African Americans ( Reiss 2002) . Despite some conflicts between US soldiers and German civilians in garrison communities, t here was considerable sociability and intimacy (H\u00f6hn 2002; Goedde 2003; Schroer 2007; Partridge 2008 ). Many relationships, mostly between German women and American Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 1 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 20 men, became a topic of local and national discussions. Prostitution w as a part of the story, b ut there were many more reasons why German women sought American servicemen as partners \u2014including African Americans who were often seen as more approachable and interested than many white American soldiers (Schroer 2007).36 Again, under the circumstances of occupation and liberation, race, nation and sexuality function as interdependent categories. Damani Partridge argues that i n this context the 'transformative force of inofficial wishes and longings' was as powe rful as more materialistic forces for chang e in postwar Germany (2008: 97). It is difficult and controversial to ponder how important sexual Afro -Americanophilia \u2014the fetishization of black bodies and collective positive expectations of what black men (a nd, to a lesser extent, women) were like in be d\u2014might have been in individual relationships, but it is unlikely that those relationships were untouched by racial discourses. I n any event, African American men began to figure as players in an amorous adventur e in a much more concrete sense than before. Sexual relationships no longer needed to take place in fantasy alone. On the African American side, alt hough black GIs did encounter racism in Germany, lower levels of race -based restrictions for occupation soldiers stationed there impelled many of them t o favourably compare their German experiences with the racial order at home, especially in the South . Some black servicemen stayed in Germany. Others used their German experiences to fight for equality at home ( Schroer 2007; H\u00f6hn & Klimke 2010a).37 There w ere, of course, other strands of Afro -Americanophilia, other ways in which Germans called upon African -America. Some people in the Western part of the country who felt they were under the yoke of their American occupiers claim ed to identify --in a more rhet orical sense than anything else --with the oppressed station of African Americans (H\u00f6hn 2002; Poiger 2000). Colonial history \u2014and a perceived distance from it\u2014was also important. (West) Germans, having lost 'their' colonies during World War 36 There were black women who worked in nightclubs catering to a predominantly (white) mal e crowd (Herb 2009). However, this is not well illuminated in the research on what Kevin Mumford (1997) in another national setting calls 'interzones.' On similar iss ues from the 1990s onwards, see Partridge (2012). 37 For an early, fictionalized account, see also William Gardner Smith's 1948 novel, Last of the Conquerors. The sexual interest in black men (African American and Afr o-German) and a sense of feeling 'used' as 'forbidden fruit' is mentioned also in the well -known memoir by Hans -J\u00fcrgen Massaquoi, the son of a white German mother and a black Liberian father, who later emigrated to the USA and worked as an editor for Ebony magazine (Massaquoi 1999: 288; Partridge 2008). Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 1 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 21 I, watched deco lonization with detachment or, in some cases, self -righteousness, as their European neighbour, France, fought its own brutal war in Algeria.38 Afro -Americanophilia was also prevalent with music enthusiasts, among whom new modes of mass -scale appropriation and subcultural connoisseurship began to form and would provide new social forms for the engagement with African Americ an aesthetics and culture. In the era of early television and mass -mediated pop music, which most historians date as beginning in the mid -1950s, youth subcultures represented a new social form to display Afro -Americanophilia. As Dick Hebdige (1978) explored in his classic study of postwar subcultures in Britain, the appropriation of black US and Jamaican styles --musical, sartorial, and bodi ly--was vital in the formation of many of the fashions that teddy boys, mods, skinheads and rockers displayed. Whilst German subcultural life -worlds were far from being as diversified or iconic as their Br itish counterparts in the postwar era, German Afro -Americanophile musical enthusiasts of the 1950s and 1960s comprised distinct groups. These groups included rock 'n' rol l fans--often defamed as Halbstarke [literally 'half strong,' but designating something like juvenile delinquent] --who enjoyed, among oth er things, the physical release of dancing to rock 'n' roll. There were also self -described true jazz devotees who associated music that had been brought to Europe, in part with support of the US State Department and its Cold War cultural programs, with ea rnest artistic endeavour, and sometimes twinned it with an interest in French existentiali sm.39 The jazz enthusiasts mostly came from a bourgeois student and bohemian milieu, and the rock fa ns from the working class, at least initially. At the same time, ne w attitudes to popular culture and tendencies of cultural dehierarchisation began to put such of such aesthetically committed subcultural circles, the 1950s saw new waves of popular exoticism and a symbolic internationalization of burgeoning consumer culture, including in the worlds of popular Schlager [hit] music, film, cooking, and interior design. There were some African American -derived elements here, including pop jazz or a 'black collectible' ( Goings 1994 ) fad for stylized female negro figures 38 Sabine Broeck (2011), for instance, speaks of a widespread p ostwar German des ire to finally be on the 'right side of history.' 39 On the Jazz Ambassadors and State Department program s, see von Eschen (2005). Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 1 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 22 (Bausinger 1961; Kramer 2012).40 However, the Black Atlantic was clearly not the primary source of popular exoticism at the time; it was not yet a mainst ream place of longing across the generations --a Sehnsuchtsort --like, say, Mediterranean Southern Europe or the Pacific islands.41 The spread or 'democratization' of commodity exoticism, facilitated by an expanding postwar economy and by the embourgeoisement of the lower middle class, made such foreign commodities \u2014which had formerly been a privilege of the few, or, perversely, available through wartime e xperience \u2014far more accessible to everyday people. This mid -century tendency towards a democratized commodity exoticism is an important milestone in the history of cultural tra nsfers and appropriations and of the shifting significance of alterity. Serious political discourses about the meanings and the morality of ra ce and racism were also part of the life -world s of Germans, of course. In both German states, visits by Martin Luther King, Jr, and other activists brought broad attention to di scrimination and to the Civil Rights Movement in the USA (H\u00f6hn & Klimke 2010a; Broeck 2011) . In the literary field, some Afri can American authors, like the Paris -based expatriate James Baldwin, were translated into German, or set as English -language texts for German high school students. These works (Baldwin 1963a, 1963b, 1963c, 1964, 1965, 1968) made Baldwin's insights into the workings of race and racism in the USA accessible to a large German readership. His bestselling essays elaborated, among other t hings, a critique of the 'White Negro' hipster figure propagated by Norman Mailer, making that critique at least theoretically available in Germany at the time.42 The methodological challenge posed by the co -presence of these different strands of African American politic s and culture is to grasp the potential interrelation between these sphe res, that is, their intertextual, interdi scursive and intermedial resonances, transfers and contradictions. Whilst examples like jazz and Baldwin's literature may make i t seem as if a sudden wave of appreciation for black people and black culture swept post -Nazi society, 40 On pop jazz and its role in German Schlager films from the 1950s, see Hurley (2010). 41 On the exoticization of West German Schlager during this time, see Karnik and Phillips (2007, ch. 3) and Mendivil (2008). A useful approach to the spatial -temporal hierarchies in such discourses is suggested by Alexander Weheliye's remarks on popular ' allochronic technologies' (2014). 42 The German translation of The Fire Next Time (Hundert Jahre Freiheit ohne Gleichberechtigung ; Baldwin 1964) sold at least 35,000 copies on its fir st printing. The essay 'The Black Boy Looks At the White Boy' Baldwin's critique of his former friend M ailer's 'n oble savage' stereotype of black men, his heterosexual white male 'sexual panic' and refusal to face rea lities dwelling instead in fantasies, was published in German in 1963 (Baldwin 1963a). Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 1 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 23 postwar relations with A frican Americans and black people should generally be read within a polarized context and a general awkwardness. Talk of race and Aryanism might have officially become taboo but the two German states still held t heir citizenry to be white (Linke 1999; Schroer 2007). In the cultural sphere, deeply embedded racist stereotypes of the Neger and a belief in the inferiority of black people lived on, thereby mai ntaining older European traditions, which in so me cases were exacerbated by the after -effects of Nazi education and propaganda. In many ways, Frantz Fanon's contemporaneous analyses (1980 [1952]) of anti -black racism in France hold true for the basic binary codes of racial meanings in postwar Germany a s well. In a general sense, the relationship of blackness and whiteness was characterized by an understanding of essent ial difference, mutual exclusiveness (complementarity) and a civilizational hierarc hy. This was similar to, but for most enthusiasts no l onger as radical as, earlier modes of primitivism. It was also accompanied by the racialized desires that Baldwin and others c ritiqued. Extreme forms of racism also continued. In particular, inter racial sexual liaisons were an on -going concern for conser vative politicians and commentators, who \u2014as they had done decades earlier \u2014made declarations about loose morality and of black US servicemen caused anxiety among West German lawmakers, especially when they approached school age in the early 1950s, and their schooling and future life -ways were subject to debate. While many within the West German polity deliberately used the children as an embodied site from which to demonstrate to the Wes tern world that it had learned its lessons from Nazism, those few thousand children were, at least in dominant national discourse, categorized as not German. As a number of memoirs by (Massaquoi 1999; Nejar 2007; biographies of Afro authors (Achenbach 2004), vividly illustrate, discrimination against Afro -Germans and their parents occurred frequently in everyday life and led to existential crises, but many individuals nonetheless lived their lives within a new German normality initially assumed that these Afro -German children should be held in readiness for some future repatriation to North America or even Africa, and indeed many we re taken to t he USA Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 1 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, Faria 2002; H\u00f6hn 2002; Fehrenbach 2007).43 The idea of a white national body politic remained thoroughly dominant. As Heide Fehrenbach notes, liberal West German society was able to advocate 'racial tol erance but insist on maintaining racial difference' (2005: 150). Within left -liberal West German discourse, opposition to racism was a moral ly charged, even foundational conviction that was perceived as part of a larger br eak with Nazi ideology (Broeck 2011). In that sense, some forms o f aesthetic Afro -Americanophilia took a strong moral , quasi -abolitionist tone. Postwar lovers of jazz, for example, perceived culturally conservative critiques of jazz to be holdovers from the indoctrination of the Nazi era. As Andrew Hurley's article in t his special issue shows, postwar German opposition to jazz had many bases and political colourings , ranging from the unreconstructed Nazi through to the leftist cultural crit icism of Adorno, but it tended to be viewed by the music's enthusiasts in monochro matic moral terms. Anti-racist, moral and political Afro -Americanophile discourses on the political Left represented an important sea change in post -fascist society, but they were not without their limits. This holds true for the capitalist West and for the communist East, albeit in different ways. When left -liberal and socialist German discourses indicted anti -black racism, as they often did, they generally referred to America n racism --to other people's problems, as it were. German Leftists made importan t arguments, but they tended to overlook everyday forms of racism and anti -Semitism at home. It can even be argued that heightened interest in American racism could, via a serie s of moralistic defence mechanisms and projections, surrogate African -Americans for Jewish victims of the Third Reich. Postwar Afro -Americanophilia was often marked by a desire to rule a thick line between oneself and the National Socialist past, and rhetorica lly countering US racism came at little cost. But the dividend was high; in a mostly unconscious logic of moral displacement and surrogation, it could render postwar liberal G ermans ex post facto good.44 Sabine Broeck has called such moralising discourses ' Stellvertreter 43 The 1952 West German film Toxi (dir. Robert Stemmle) illustrate s compellingly the underlying postwar racial liberalism. It is critical of racial pre judice and various ways of instrumentalizing the child, but it finds its happy end when Toxi is adopted by her (respectable) Blac k family from the USA (Fehrenbach 2007; Fe nner 2011). For some Afro -Germans, transatlantic lifeworlds are an important reality and resource, typified by the founding of The B lack German Cultural Society in the USA in 1999. 44 On race, ethnic drag and surrogation in postwar Germany see Sieg (2009). By virtue of the long - standing association between African Americans, Jews and jazz, it is possible to read postwar interest in Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 1 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 25 [surrogate] abolitionism,' whereby postwar German 'campaigns of political solidarity with black liberation were ... oftentimes predicated on rather vague kinds of emotional 'elective affinity' with black humanity suffering at the hands of white U.S. -American bigotry' (2011: 128). In the process, African Americans wer e frequently represented 'pornotropically' as passive, yet simultaneously eroticized, victims of racism in the USA. African American culture and political concerns in the GD R In the German Democratic Republic (GDR), which was under Russian occupation, actual contact with African Americans was very limited and Ameri canization obviously did not occur on a comparable scale with the West German experience, which is not to say that ideologues did not regard it as a considerable danger for socie ty, especially before the Berlin wall was built in 1961. Aside from a few le ft-wing African American expatriates, like the Berlin -based singer and teacher Aubrey Pankey, the relatively small group of black people in East Germany consisted of African and Africa n diasporic diplomats and students. A larger black population (though certainly not an A frican American one) would only emerge in the East German guest worker progr ams of the 1970s and 1980s.45 Even though the resident population was tiny, African American culture a nd political concerns featured prominently in many East German discourses. There was, in a basic political sense, an elective affinity between the socialist st ate and some important African American intellectuals of the time, including W. E. B . DuBois, Rich ard Wright and Paul Robeson, who were at least sympathetic toward communist idea ls and the anti - imperialist socialist camp in world politics. Building on the inter war communist tradition, the GDR saw itself as an anti -racist state above prejudice, and oppo sed to forms of imperialism in which racial exploitation was rooted \u2014it attempted to 'see through race' as Loren Kruger (2003) puts it. Official whistle blowi ng on US racism was an important form of anti -US propaganda, although it could build on genuine desires for social justice. jazz as a type of surrogated philo -Semitism (Hurley 2008). On the postwar shift between locating race in Jewishness to blackness , see Fehrenbach (2005: 156). 45 On Pankey and his opposition to being typecast in operas, as well as the sympathy that he generated, see Rauhut (2008: 237). On the place of ethnic and racial 'Others' in th e GDR, see Behrends, Lindenberger and Poutros (200 3), which shows how refugees and guest workers were exposed to quite ambivalent messages from both the local populace, and from t he regime. Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 1 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 26 In the realm of aesthetics and culture, the East German state propagated readings of African American expressive forms that were primarily focusse d on 'materialist' aesthetics and ideology, very much in tune with the ways in which the state viewed culture in general . Some African American culture was identified as a 'second cult ure' in Lenin's terminology, that is, as the legitimate folk voice of an oppressed working - class people (Rauhut 2008: 232). In that context, African American s were seen as the epitome of the other America in a positive sense ( Rauhut 2008, n. 2013) . Music like work songs and folk -blues were considered appropriate and worthwhile cultural forms. Spirituals were also thought palatable, provided they could be interpreted in a socialist or more widely humanist frame. Indeed, official approbation was showered on African Americ an spiritual singer and actor Paul Robeson (whose records were also distributed widely in the GDR and after whom streets and schools were named) because of his social ist-communist politics and his work -song and spiritual repertoire.46 In that sense, a specific kind of Afro - Americanophilia was part of State cultural policy in the GDR. Some of the crit ical arguments about the limits of anti -racism to which we referred in the paragraphs above are relevant in this context, too. It should not be f orgotten, and most GDR citizens were certainly aware of it, that State anti-racism was propagated by a governme nt that itself oppressed its population in a more straightforward way than in the West. There was, furthermore, a strict dividing line betw een 'good' and 'bad' culture. It is striking that East German cultural authorities (similar to conservatives and many 'old left' thinkers in the West) clearly wanted black music, for instance, to be appreciated in a well -mannered and rational way. Excess like that displayed in a pop cultural frame was inappropriate. Hence, if spirituals and folk -blues were ideologicall y acceptable, then other forms of African -American culture were more problematic. In particular, jazz was met with alternating phases of snap and thaw, alternating 'like a sine wave, ' as Michael Rauhut puts it (2008: 232). Prior to a relaxation in the late 1960s, the only jazz that was thought appropriate was 'trad' or folk -tinged jazz --as opposed Robeson, see Dyer (1986) and Duberman (2005). On his relations with the Soviet bloc, see Lewis (1998) and Caut e (2003: 446 -450). Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 1 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 27 Rust 2010, 2011). Rock 'n' roll --and especially the Beat music of the early 1960s --and its fans suffered in rather radical and violent state crackdowns on supposedly deleterious and supposedly fascist youth behaviour (Poiger 2000; Rauhut 1993, 1996). In this unruly and excessive form, and given the cle ar enthusiasm for US popular cultural heroes, grass roots Afro -Americanophiles were seen as subversive to the socialist order of things and detrimental to an enlightened, educated, civilized 'soci alist personality.' For many young people, that was also par tly what it was about. Many functionaries also dismissed these musics in openly racist vocabulary. Despite offici al denials, anti -black racism was clearly a part of East German life (Poiger 2000). This narrative could go on. Not everything that is of rel evance can be covered here; nor has it all been adequately researched. Among the lacunae in a more c omplete history of Afro -Americanophilia in postwar East Germany, we should mention the state reaction to the Civil Rights and Black Freedom movements (compa re H\u00f6hn & Klimke 2010a), the connection between these strands and the GDR's 'anticolonial' fore ign policy, and, on the cultural side, GDR translations of African American lite rature like Richard Wright's Native Son (1969). A consumer culture began to devel op in the GDR too, but it did so more slowly than in the West, and consumption was not supposed t o form a primary mode of relating to the world. Rather, the models were i nternational solidarity and exchange as at the World Festival of Youth and Students he ld in Berlin in 1951 and at events like the annual Festival des politischen Liedes [Festival of Political Song]. In this context, blues and blues -rock had a special history in the GDR as a niche (sub)culture, as we will elaborate further in our second surv ey essay. A full cultural history of what these forms meant for listeners and readers has yet to be written. Clearly, State Afro -Americanophilia stands out when compared to other sociocultural constellations in the GDR. This had a politically rationalist form, as opposed to the hedonism of consumer - and pop - culture and their risqu\u00e9 qualities. Its base was in the State, rather than in oppositional groups and subcultures or amongst fan -scholars and aesthetic experts. It professed humanist, anti -racist idea ls, with a high grade of abstraction. This officially promulgated type of Afo -Americanophilia also existed in a context where there was a striking difference between official p ronouncements and the lived reality of a populace that was widely sceptical of a nd hostile towards the government it considered red and Russian. Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 1 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 28 Conclusions In summary, when compared not only with the Nazi era but also with t he late colonial and Weimar eras, the postwar era saw a continued cultural (and, i n the West, political) Americ anization. In this context there was a rapid rise and diversific ation in forms of Afro -Americanophilia. What had primarily been an urban, and more diffusely Negrophile fashion in the 1920s, now also became more specifically Afr ican American. It also spread and became democratized amongst a larger group of people. African American culture, or, more precisely, mass -cultural representations based in African American culture, again became something to consume and dance to. We have sketched how Afro -Americanophi lia connected with the emerging culture of pop music and with consumer culture more generally. In the process of reception, many young G ermans incorporated African American culture into their everyday life -worlds. In the West, they also encountered African American soldiers and began personal encounters and, in some cases, liaisons. Seen from the perspective of African Ame ricans, West Germany became a temporary \u2014in some cases, permanent \u2014place of residence with racial rules that differed significantly from th e USA, especially the US South. New spaces of contact and interaction emerged. Official US foreign policy also pr omoted American culture through a number of channels . High -cultural readings of jazz, for example, propagated a more austere, modernist Afro -Americanophile sensibility. At the same time, many forms of postwar German Afro -Americanophilia were tinged by a remarkable earnestness and moral fervour that set them apart from the ironic, 'funny savage' theme in much 1920s Negrophilia. We can only specul ate about how this earnestness articulated with wider tendencies of postwar cul ture\u2014with the legacy of the millions dead; the destruction; the felt or repressed guilt; the simultaneously felt sense of German victimhood \u2014but it seems clear that it was closel y connected with a wide -spread desire for a new, ethical position in the world. The moral fervour of some Afro -Americanophile sentiment sprang from a combative context of racism and anti - Semitism in a post -Nazi society, where opposition to African American culture was, often for good reason, equated with the legacy of National Socialism. It could also be connected to optimistic socialist -humanist sentiments of human equality In both countries, official policy pronounced a radical break with Nazi philosophy and opposed explicit anti -black racism. In that sense state policy was Afro -Americanophile. Ege and Hurley Periodizing and Historicizing 1 PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 29 Yet, notably in regard to citizenship and immigration rules, there were limits to the anti - racism policies of both states. With some exceptions there als o seems to have been a broad cultural continuation of categorical thinking about race. There was also no complete break with both the primitivist mode of 1920s Negrophilie and its implication of a 'complementary' separation of black and white. In this way, postwar A fro- Americanophilia, despite all its complexities and ambiguities, oft en reproduced racist images and patterns of thought, albeit weighted positively. In our sec ond joint survey essay, we examine more of the implications of such projections and enc ounters. The division of Germany added an extra layer of complication. Some A frican American -derived cultural forms were welcomed within the East German Sta te's cultural policy, indeed more so than by conservative Western politicia ns. But these forms needed to be read in socialist terms, and various unruly aspects of African American culture were subjected to crackdown when they seemed to be deleterious to the socialist project. African American culture also became a US tool in Cold War era politics, via broadcast ing, so -called 'jazz ambassadors' and other means. A rationalist and folkloristic mode of Afro -Americanophilia, together with clear political statements against US racism and imperialism, characterized the East's public sphere, but that did not necessarily converge with the logic of informal everyday life, where the regime had little credibility. In the West, a more consumerist version of 'xenophilia' gained in importance, and youth subcultures formed in various contact zones. Des pite the West German govern ment's official anti -racism, there was a 'cultural bloc' of conservative politics and culture, which clearly continued to display a racializ ed understanding of what was and was not German. Younger Afro -Americanophiles, be they pop -cultural or of the more s erious and moralistic strand, discerned the continuation of Nazi pat terns. These shifting sands could render certain types of German Afro -Americanophilia political in different ways at different times. With this as a preface, we now leave the first part of our timeline in the mid -1960s, prior to the rise of the counterculture in Germany and the emergence of the Black Power Movement in the USA. At that point Afro -Americanophilia took different forms and radicalized significantly, and its patterns afterward s also came to be directly challenged, including by a self -identifying Afro -German community. Those are matters addressed in our second survey essay.

Moritz Ege, Ludwig Maximilian University Munich Andrew Wright Hurley, University of Technology Sydney From a 'provincial' and (hopefully) self-aware European perspective, i t is clear that cultural forms or practices that originated among African Americ ans have, beyond their value to African Americans themselves and people elsewhere, contri buted tremendously to life on the European continent. Those contributions include everything from the political imaginaries of the Civil Rights and Black Power movements , through philosophical thought, to literature, film, television, theatre, dance, sports, visual culture and everyday aesthetics. Most prominent, perhaps, have been forms of musi c\u2014blues and jazz to r'n'b, rap, and hybrid electronic music forms\u2014all of w hich have 'furnished' European listeners' lives, whatever their so-called race. Whil e deeply embedded racism can run through these processes of cultural flow, transfer, and appropr iation, and numerous forms of exploitation are at work, in many cases there is also an ambiguous love for Black diasporic culture, at least according to the appropriat ing subjects' view of themselves, which manifests itself in admiration, desire, a sense of affinity or connection, and sometimes in fantasies of 'becoming black.'1 This issue's papers, which 1 By using terms like 'black' and 'white' we refer to socially dominant categorizations t hat do not mirror any biologically 'real' essence, but are made meaningful by h istory and by present forms of ascription, discrimination, and political empowerment movements. Categorizations like ' white' and 'black' are not entirely isomorphic across situations and societal -cultural contexts. We tend to spell the word with a capital letter ('Black') in the context of terminological exp ressions, of emphatic, affirmative usages and Ege and Hurley Introduction: Afro -Americanophilia PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 2 present case studies of what we will call Afro -Americanophilia, address the forms, ambiguities and politics involved in these cultural processes in 20th -century Ge rmany. This interest builds on the existing literature about Black diasporic formations, including those in Europe, and on writings on cultural traffic and flow t hat take place under conditions of inequality. If we take a global view, it is clear that th e people, cultures and politics of the Black Atlantic more generally have shape d the experience of modernity and post -modernity in many parts of the world. Paul Gilroy's suggestion that Black Atlantic cultures form a 'counterculture of modernity' (Gil roy 1 993: 29) has dominated the research literature on these questions for quite some time. Clearly, people of the Black Atlantic have shaped the world through their labour (for a long time forced/enslaved), ethico -politically (through the influence of social m ovements and thought that were directed against slavery, colonialism, racism, a nd sexism), and aesthetically (through arts and cultural production). Furthermore, t hey have created diasporic modes of belonging and collectivity, that traverse borders and imaginaries, be they national or continental, and simultaneously render the contingent but nonethe less violent nature of such borders more visible. Here, however, following an important yet neglected line of inquiry in works such as Gilroy's, we are interes ted not so much in the 'negative continent' of the Black Atlantic itself, but in its e ffect on Europe, and the resulting difficulties of delimiting self and other. Contrary to wha t old and new forms of racism and nationalism would have us believe, both histo rically and with regard to 'the contemporary multiculture,' and the results of decades of drift,' Europe is not 2013). Or, as Gilroy apodictically put it some years ago, 'the peculiar synonymity of the terms E uropean and white cannot continue' (Gilroy 2004: xii). Of course, the main reason why it cannot continue lies in t he political demands for justice and recognition of Europe's diverse populations. Proces ses of cultural flow and appropriation, however, are a nother important reason why purity (be it cultural or 'racial') can be no more than a fantasy. While, on a more descriptive, historiographical level, the fundament al importance of Afro -diasporic presences and influences is relatively well -documented in c ountries with large Black populations, it is less well known in other countries \u2014like Germany --where of intentionally po litical identities, but not as a general rule. Quotation ma rks are used occasionally to serve as reminders of the terms' problematic nature. Ege and Hurley Introduction: Afro -Americanophilia PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 3 the actual presence of people of African origin has been relativel y small. Yet, here, too, Afro -diasporic influences, or what Harry J. Elam, Jr, and Kennell M. Jackson call global 'black cultural traffic,' have played out in important yet complicat ed ways (Elam & Jackson 2005). A body of research literature on this question has start ed to consolidate, and the goal of this special edition of Portal Journal of Multidisciplinary International Studies is to take a step back, review the literature and its impli cations and contribute to the historiographic discussion and the attendant wider debate.2 A fundamental result of German research to date has been to show that the German interest in Afro -diasporic culture has been far from homogeneous in its forms, functi ons, politics and positionalities, while, at the same time, some si gnificant patterns of dominance have persisted over long periods of time. 'White' majori tarian Germans, with a variety of attendant convictions and social positions, have brought their desires, preconceptions and the weight of colonial discourses into the equation. Germans of colour, including Black Germans or Afro -Germans, have also engaged in complex ways with things African American. At a basic level, our two joint essays and the individual papers in this special edition seek to plumb that heterogeneity. While we grant most attention to the second half of the twentieth century, our first su rvey essay sketches the important prehistory. But first some words about terminology. In order to search for patterns in the heterogeneous German engagement w ith the black diaspora, we have oriented ourselves by using the term Afro -Americanophilia that Moritz Ege advanced in his 2007 study of West German culture in the lat e 1960s and early 1970s. In Ege's coinage, the term Afro -Americanophilia denotes a 'cultural theme' of wide -spread enthusiasm for African American culture and politics, whic h manifested in a surge in 'positive' (often highly sexualized) images of black pe ople in visual culture, high demand for soul music, solidarity activities for the Black Panther Party among student activists, and a wide range of other more or less ephemeral attempts to show closeness to African Americans (see Ege, in this volume). These practices of fashioning white selves by connecting them to signs and experi ences coded 2 While this is not the place to comprehensively document ho w Gilroy's notion of the Black Atlantic (more famous t han Robert Farris Thompson's earlier usage) has been received in Ger many, it is worthwhile pointing out that the primary vector of re ception initially comprised advanced music journalists and cultural critics. A later, more academically oriented milestone was a conference and subsequent publication organized by Paul Gilroy, Fati ma El -Tayeb and Tina Campt, and specifically titled 'Der Black Atlantic' (Berlin 2004). Other relevan t works include the volume Blackening Europe , edited by Heike Raphael -Hernandez and Hurley Introduction: Afro -Americanophilia PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 4 as black were especially inflected by the contours of the post -Nazi era, when explicitly racist voc abularies were (largely) taboo in public discourse, and when many \u2014but by no means all --younger Germans searched for identities untainted by the legacy of Germ an fascism. This was also an optimistic time when new African s tates and the Black Power movement in the USA challenged and redefined the global 'colour line.' From a m ore critical perspective, however, we can view young Afro -Americanophile Germans of the day as searching for an identification in order to ' align themselves with the victims and avengers of genocide, rather than its perpetrators and accomplices,' and doi ng so without questioning the implications of their own whiteness, as the drama scholar Katrin Sieg puts it (2002: 13) .3 In our two joint essays we attend to the ambiguities in post-war Af ro-Americanophilia, but we are also interested in the prehistory and afterlife of the high Afro -Americanophilia of the post -war era. Afro -Americanophilia is a cultural theme that presents itself at di fferent levels and in different intensities. It can de note simple mimesis of 'black' cultural practices \u2014 moments of dancing to 'black' music, singing along, or a passing imagina ry identification, as in reading and other forms of cultural recepti on or consumption. Such moments, ephemeral as they tend to be, do not necessarily have great relevance to the individual, and they certainly do not amount to strong empathy, recognition, or commitment within a collective, but they can contribute to signific ant overarching cultural themes. For some individuals (and, in so me cases, for groups such as youth sub - cultures), Afro -Americanophilia can also exceed transient moments of mimesis and t ake the form of a more stable yet somehow ineffable, embodied identifica tion with 'being Black' and with 'Blackness,' that is, with the imaginary essence of the African American experience, whatever that may be understood to mean (Johnson 2003: 4) . At different times, various non -black dissidents became disenchanted with their conventional 'white' identities and felt an elective affinity with African diasporic experience. For some protagonists of Afro -Americanophilia, this even became a life - long process. We can call their type of identification 'enhanced' Af ro-Americanophilia. At times Afro -Americanophilia like this can fa ntasies and desires of 'becoming black.' 'Becoming black' was famously by the French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and F\u00e9lix Guattari (1987), who used the term to translate 3 From the beginning, we must stress that German socie ty was not Afro -Americanophile in its entirety; rather, only significant groups within it were. Ege and Hurley Introduction: Afro -Americanophilia PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 5 ambiguous practices of imitation, appropriation, and desire into a f antasy o f imaginary or symbolic 'race -change.'4 The trope of 'becoming black' tended to be employed in verbal discourse with some awareness of its own counterfactual, im aginary character, and the practices that we term Afro -Americanophile could sometimes also be i ronic and self-aware. This irony is retained within the term, in the combination of a politically charged 1960s self -designation \u2014'Afro -American' \u2014with a rather formal, antiquated Greek suffix, ' -philia.' The neologism is, of course, reminiscent of the term Negrophilia (n\u00e9grophilie in French), which, as we show in our first joint essay, has been advanced in discussions of 'primitivist' culture of the 1920s, first by its (w hite) protagonists, then by cultural historians. It is still used by some commentators i n order to refer to cases of strong 'white' love for 'Black' culture in the present time. We will discuss Negrophilia in the sense of its 1920s manifestation in our first joint essay, but we will not use the term trans -historically, as the wording seems no t suited for that purpose. Instead, in a hopefully more palatable dehistoricization, we apply the neologism Afro - Americanophilia to phenomena in different historical moments, whether or not the term 'Afro -American' was in use at the time. When we use the term Afro -Americanophilia in this special issue we mainly have in mind Black cultures in the USA. If, however, the Black Atlantic forms an interconnected entity, this is an arbitrary delimitation.5 Nonetheless, German Afro - Americanophilia related largely \u2014but not exclusively \u2014to Black USA, and not, say, to Cuba, Haiti, or Brazil.6 While comparisons are difficult to make, it seems safe to sa y that many 'Afro -Americanophiles' also were much less interested in the culture s, politics, and people from the African continent. The USA was the dominant world power in the 20th century, and we believe there often was a specificity to this 'love' for that reason. This is not to deny that other elements of the Black At lantic or a less nationally defined sense of 'Blacknes s' and also 'Africanness' had a part to play in German Afro -Americanophilia, and co -constituted US African American culture, but 4 Echoing the 1970s (predominantly 'white') countercul tures' predilection for drama and ecstatic communion, Deleuze and Guattari envisioned new 'blocs of becom ing' in which members of minorities and of the majority would communally 'become minor,' th at is, leave behind their pre -given, rigid, rationalist, hierarchically positioned subjectivities in a mutual process of transformation and dis - identification (Deleuze & Guattari 1987). See also Wright (2 004). 5 The interconnectedness of the 'creole' zone is a mat ter that the critic Ernest Borneman was early to contemplate (see Detlef Siegfried's discussion of Borneman in this special edition). 6 For work on Cuba in the German imaginary, see for ex ample, Hosek (2012); on German engagements with Brazilian and Teuto -Brazilian interculturalities, see Finger, Kath\u00f6fer Hurley Introduction: Afro -Americanophilia PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 6 we cannot do them justice here. Indeed, we believe that a more pre cise analysis of those relationships represents a crucial fi eld of on -going and future research.7 For the purpose of understanding Afro -Americanophilia, we need to think carefully about temporality. What, exactly, was the relationship between the G erman love for African American culture in the 1920s and its varian t in the 1960s? Were they two instantiations of an 'exoticism' that remained, in its internal s tructure, more or less identical? Amiri Baraka suggests that African American culture can be seen and heard as a 'changing same' over time, due to a basic 'doubl e consciousness' (W. E. B. du Bois) within the modern world. Does something similar hold true for the ambivalent German love of African American culture? (We will discuss tha t ambivalence in a moment.) It is for the individual papers in this special editio n and other studies to illuminate that question. Our basic methodological sensibility, however, follows Stuart Hall's insights about racism in societies 'structured in dominance ,' which stress the specificity of spatiotemporal constellations, even whilst a dmitting of commonalities between social systems that are structured in a racist way (Hall 1980). Following such an approach, then, we might think of German Afro -Americanophilia as an object that is internally heterogeneous and changes its forms and its me anings, implications and political effects over time. Accordingly, we have sought to analyse specific socio - cultural constellations (of desires, of forms of appropriation and solidarity, of subject positions, of agency), without denying that overarching te ndencies \u2014especially in power relations \u2014are likely to be relevant. One obvious way to think about German Afro -Americanophilia is to ponder how to periodize it. We can think of such an endeavour as arriving at a timeline of Germa n 'desire/demand for Black c ultural material,' to borrow Kennell Jackson's phrase (2005). Such a timeline must be attuned to three partly countervailing things. It needs to take into account the chronological ruptures of German history; it must take into acc ount the histories of the USA, particularly African American history; but also, conceptually, it needs to be alive to a transnational frame , not just a national or Euro -American one.8 7 For example, one pheno menon that we have not been able to analyse in our j oint essays, and where the literature is in its infancy, is the German reception of reg gae, an Afro -Caribbean form originating in Jamaica, and an Afro -diasporic phenomenon par excellence. It is for future research to determine how its reception and re -contextualization in Germany mirrors or diverges from thos e of US African American art forms like blues, soul and disco. 8 Immanuel Wallerstein's writings on 'world systems' are per tinent here (Wallerstein 20 11). On the Ege and Hurley Introduction: Afro -Americanophilia PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 7 In our two jointly authored survey essays, we identify the detail and d raw out some of the implic ations of the increasingly diverse research on German Afro -Americanophilia. Our overall approach in these essays is to give an outline of histori cal phases of Afro - Americanophilia. The underlying aim is to advance a differentiated vi ew of German Afro -Ameri canophilia that is able to account for the continuities, ruptures a nd general complexities of global cultural flows and reception. Pulling into focus the Black diaspora's interactions and convergences with German history is import ant for another reason: it highlights transnational sources of sociocultural change and creativity that are often overlooked in the writing of cultural history. Such a task can destabilize eurocentric narratives and help question the supposed mutual exclusivity of spatio - political entities like a nation -state\u2014or a diaspora, for that matter \u2014by showing how such entities overlap and sometimes dissolve. There is something else that needs to be borne in mind. Cultural li fe in Germany has been enriched in many ways by Afro -Americanophil ia. These contributions can be studied descriptively and analytically, for instance as forms of cult ural transfer .9 But, as should be clear by now, Afro -Americanophilia is not just a story of contribution, solidarity, and transcultural flow. There has also been contention, misrecognition, struggle, and violence. First of all, unambiguous racism still shapes the reality lived by Black people in Germany and provides a sombre backdrop to stories of Afro - Americanophilia (see e.g. Sow 2008; El -Tayeb 2011) . Moreo ver there can also be a violence intrinsic to ' -philia' itself, or to the notion of would -be 'colourblindness.'10 Those Germans who have loved African American cultures were somet imes merely problems of periodization, see Paul Gilroy's criticism of Habe rmas, Lyotard, Jameson and others who regard World War II as the significant orientating rupture, globally (1993: 42) . For a contrary approach to Europe, using African America as the starting place, see the edited volume, Blackening Europe (Raphael - Hernandez 2004). 9 In such approaches, the analyst often takes a seemingly n eutral, unpolitical bird's eye's view, which has been popular in German cultural history. For an overview of mod els of cultural transfer that has been influential in Germany see e.g. Burke 2000 (originally in English). 10 As critics like Fatima El -Tayeb note (2011), today many if not most white Germ ans\u2014including many who have engaged with African American cultures an d people \u2014often see themselves as fundamentally non-racial and non -racist: aggressive whiteness is other people's busines s, as it were. Yet this is despite their (which is to say: our) reliance on an implicitly racia lized self -image and a complex regime of border policing that, despite historical and current diversity, maintai ns the country's dominant white -Germanness, materially and metaphorically, through a repertoire that defines the national body as 'white' and Germa ns of colour as marginal or not -really -there. El -Tayeb argues that in Europe in general, 'race' figure s as an 'unspeakable presence,' which 'makes itself felt from day -to-day interactions to transcontinental political structures, while simultaneously being deemed non -existent within European t hought' (El -Tayeb 2011: xviii). The basic situation is one of a ' peculiar coexistence of, on the one hand, a regime o f continent - wide recognized visual markers that construct non -whiteness as non -Europeanness with on the other a discourse of colorblindnes s that claims not to see racialized difference' -Americanophilia PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 8 'flipping' and positively weighting the negative stereotypes that anti-black German racists applied. Given unequal resources, white Germans' desire f or black cultural material has often impelled people of colour to perform to those expe ctations, accommodate themselves or otherwise negotiate with them. This was certainly the case in the first half of the twentieth century, when many black people f ound employment as performers under particularly hostile circumstances. Yet many peopl e of colour in Germany today still feel such dynamics when, for instance, stereotype s have an impact upon their employment opportunities (or lack thereof) or on interpersonal encounters.11 Given these realities, we need to ensure that accounts of Afro -Americanophilia illuminate not only the functions that these practices fulfilled for (primarily wh ite) actors and their constructions and experiences of their enhanced 'selve s,' but also the ways in which individual Black actors accommodate and/or disrupt white de sires, or capitalize upon felt empathy and solidarity. There is an extensive critical li terature about the 'white' consumption of racial Otherness (primarily in English, some also in German). The ente rtainments of blackface minstrelsy and their racial politics and legacies have been debate d particularly extensively and controversially. Accord ing to Eric Lott's work on North American minstrelsy, Love and Theft (1996), this popular theatrical form was shot through with both revulsion and attraction, and many other things besides. Similar issues arise in the context of 'enhanced' Afro -Americanoph ilia as well. Critics have hence offered scathing critiques of the racializing exoticism that drove and continues to drive what Norman Mailer (1957) famously called 'the White Negro.'12 In this context, bell hooks (1992) advanced the influential notion of c ultural 'anthropophagy,' stressing the aggressive side of such practices; of incorporation; of the symbolic de struction of a difference that the consumer simultaneously upholds \u2014often in the form of very stereotypical distortions \u2014for the purposes of power a nd pleasure. From a vantage point of psychoanalysis and cultural theory, Kobena Mercer (2013) and others also enquired 11 For instance, many contributors to the volume Farbe bekennen (Oguntoye, Opitz & Schultz 1986) --a landmark volume of Black German women's activist writing; se e our second joint essay i n this special issue --stress that receiving race-based 'compliments' make actual personal encounters very difficul t. David Theo Goldberg argues that 'the sometime exotici zing of black bodies and sexuality' in Germany forms the exception to the overall Euro pean rule of 'casualness about interracial social intercourse ' (2009: 185). For an ethnographic account of this exoticization, seen from differ ent perspectives, see Partridge (2012). 12 On German iterations of the 'White Negro' in West Germany in the 1960s, see Siegfried (2010); James Baldwin's contemporaneous critique is discussed in t he essays by Ege and Hurley below. Ege and Hurley Introduction: Afro -Americanophilia PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 9 into the ways in which racial fetishization can be at play. Such a pproaches add depth to more materialist arguments like those of Amiri B araka (1995) and Perry A. Hall (1997) that highlight the appropriation (or rather expropriation) of Black cultur al production for white profit. In combination, these debates have fundamentally changed t he ways that processes of projection and appropriation are discussed in the USA and elsewhere. However, despite such critical interventions overseas and although such a n analysis has been advocated outside the mainstream German media by antiracist ac tivists and scholars for some time (see references below), s uch ideas are not yet widespread in Germany. Indeed, to people from countries with a longer tradition of B lack activism, it often comes as a shock to see how white Germans have felt at libe rty to put on blackface, literally and figuratively. The shock is c ompounded by how socially accepted such practices are, and by how aggressively many Germans reject any criticism of those practices.13 Critical voices, particularly those of Black German intellec tuals, have for a long time remained on the margins. Having s aid that, we do need to recognise that the status quo is also being cha llenged. Questions of 'race' and its relevance in Europe and in Germany, in particular, are being posed more explicitly, in a more sustained way, and by a more diverse group of people, though the strength of the concomitant backlash is hard to measure. In a cademia, numerous texts on Afro -Germans, on African Americans and Germany, and on Blacks in Germany have been published recently, as we will discuss their im plications for a history of Afro -Americanophilia further in our two joint essays. The shifting acade mic focus is entangled with broader transformations in the social world t oo. It reflects, variously, the rising relevance of concepts of race, racism and ethni city in a more diverse G ermany,14 the transnational trend in historiography, and, especially, the growth and increasing political consciousness of Black Germans. These are crossed with changes in the media that can allow critical voices to cut through (Sieg 2015). European 13 This is a point made by Katrin Sieg, in the introduction to h er seminal study of 'ethnic drag' practices in Germany. She notes, for exampl e, that whereas French audiences found a 1988 blackface per formance 'utterly offensive,' Germans regarded such practices as 'utterly unremarkable'; indeed they have acquired 'normative status on the West German stage' (Sieg 2002: 2). On recent responses to contemporary blackfacing in Germany, compare Thurn (2014) and Sieg (2015). 14 In Germany, the demographic descriptor 'background of migr ation' is commonly used. It is unclear and problematic \u2014for example, it includes Germans born in Germany whose parents ca me from elsewhere. In some ways, however, it seems an indispensable category, especially given that 'race' was a taboo subject for surveys. The overall percentage of people with such a background is about 20 percent. In many urban schools, students whose p arents speak a language other than German are in a numeric majori ty. For statistics, see 'Migration, Integration' (2015). Ege and Hurley Introduction: Afro -Americanophilia PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 10 Union p olicies relating to diversity and anti -discrimination are requiring changes in local administration and everyday life. Critical studies by Susan A rndt (2001), Maureen Maisha Eggers et al. (2005), Kien Nghi Ha et al. (2007), Grada Kilomba (2008), Noah Sow ( 2008), Susan Arndt and Nadja Ofuatey -Alazar (2011) and others foreground the knowledge of people of colour about racism and question the privileges of bei ng 'white' and discursively 'unmarked.' Ethn icity in Postnational Europe (2011) also question how Black European cultural politics relate to broader European minority discourses. Given these different intellectual traditions and political standpoint s, our focus on Afro - Americanophilia is intended to contribute to an analysis of sociocultural life that critically reflects cultural and social structurings through ra ce and highlights relations rather than substances or essences. We intentionally do not pose a tra nshistorical question about Afro -Americ anophilia's effects. Instead, in different case studies and situations, the authors decipher a contentious network of distributed agency that sometimes remains a 'white' monologue, and sometimes creates 'lines of flight' for different subjects and actors, to use Deleuze and Guattari's vocabulary (1987). Examining these networks and lines of flight adds to our understanding of the continuing relevance of 'race' in Germany, and provides insights into the workings of racialized sociocultural formations that mi ght otherwise go unnoticed. After all, if racism is a problem that white people cause, then understanding it --in order to overcome it --requires us to examine the affective undercurrents of whiteness. T he case studies in this special issue provide particula rly relevant material on which to do so. The individual papers in this issue In the two jointly authored survey essays included in this special is sue, we advance a two-part periodization of twentieth century German Afro -Americanophilia. The first essay examines the 'pre -history' of Afro -Americanophilia, beginning with the reception in German -speaking lands of African people, ideas and cultures prior to the 19th century. We then look at the German reception of such things as the antebellum US novel by Harriet Beecher Stowe, Uncle Tom's Cabin , before moving through the German colonial, the Weimar, the National Socialist and the postwar er as, when cultural forms such as minstrelsy, ragtime, cakewalk, jazz and other Afro -diasporic musical forms were received in Germany. The essay also examines the ways in which the lives of Ege and Hurley Introduction: Afro -Americanophilia PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 11 Afro -Germans during these eras are being painstakingly reconstructed by his torians. The second essay tracks the contours and manifestations of Afro -Americanophilia in the counter -culture er a and beyond that era. The authors attend to Afro -Americanophile aspects of the new social movements in Germany, including second -wave feminism and Afro -German activism, and contemplate further 'hotspots' in the recepti on of Afro - diasporic cultural forms, including disco, hiphop and techno. The authors finally return to the question of what continuities an attempt to periodize Afro -Americanophilia might obscure. The historian Detlef Siegfried turns his attention to the crucia l figure of Ernest (Ernst) Born eman(n), who emigrated from Germany in the 1930s and, in his own way, re-traced some of the legs of the Black Atlantic, spending time in the UK a nd in North America prior to returning to German -speaking lands in the 1960s. In a remarkably broad career that spanned literary writing, film -making, ethnomusicology and sexology, Borneman also pioneered jazz scholarship, applying what he referred to as an a nthropological perspective to the art form. He benefited from personal contact wi th Afro -Caribbean expatriat es resident in London, and later engaged in an important public dispute w ith Amiri Baraka over Black cultural nationalism and jazz. Cultural historian Andrew Hurley examines the Afro -Americanophile changes evident in the career of the West German jazz wr iter, producer and broadcaster, Joachim Ernst Berendt. He contemplates how Berendt earnestly deployed Afro -Americanophilia in the postwar era in a moralistic attempt to render German culture l ess chauvinist. He then examines how Berendt's Afro -Americanophi lia broke down after being confronted by militant Black nationalism in the late 1960s, and how Berendt's -philic energies mutated into what might be called polyphilia. In his contribution, Moritz Ege turns special attention to both the wi de-spread commod itization of Afro -Americanophilia in the late 1960s and early 1970s in West Germany, and the counter -cultural manifestations of the Afro -Americanophile cultural theme during the same era, which included the activities of a smal l movement that named itself the 'Berlin Blues.' As the article shows, the 'racial' undert ones of ideas of sexual liberation and cultural revolution were important in connecting both realms and, more generally, in forming subjectivities of the 1968 generation. Finally, hip -hop schola r Leo Schmieding analyses the different ways in which East -Ege and Hurley Introduction: Afro -Americanophilia PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 12 Germans engaged with hip -hop culture during the final decade of the German Democratic Republic. He considers interpretations of US hip -hop as the 'second culture' of an oppressed working class, and he also examines how grass -roots East German rappers began to make the idiom their own. In this context, Schmieding contemplates the double role of the DT64 broadcaster Lutz Schramm, who kept the functionaries happy with his verbal mediation of the hip -hop genre, but also provided the scene with the music and arcane knowledge they hungered for, as wel l as a platform where their own efforts could be publicized. These case studies give new insights into important aspects of Afr o-Americanophilia in 20th cen tury Germany and into some of its protagonists. We acknowledge that t he case studies' primary preoccupation is with (white) men, who with their constructions and deconstructions of whiteness and masculinity undoubtedly form a core German Afro - Americanophil e group, and we also recognise that the articles were written fr om similar positionalities. We planned a larger special edition that would have included a wider and more diverse array of topics and writers, but unfortunately that did not come to pass. We p roceeded with the scaled back edition in the belief that it adds t o the already wide - ranging and multifaceted literature, but fully aware that there i s much more to tell. Readers wishing to investigate those other areas are directed to t he literature that we discuss in this introduction, and especially in Ege's and Hurley's two j ointly authored survey essays.

It is no accident that both Jazz and Cinema should have developed in that excellent melti ng-pot of peoples and races which is America. Here the process of international and intersocial penetr ation reached its height in the form of a merchant civilization which commercialized al l forms of art at a rate which left Europe dazzled and agape.

Fran\u00e7oise Grauby , University of Sydney Proust's critics have acknowledge d that the volumes of A la Recherche du temps perdu (Remembrance of Things Past ) are about the narrator finding his voice as a writer and taking the conscious decision to investigate his own past in order to draw general laws about life, love and art (Descombes 1987; Fraisse 1992; Marchaisse 2009 ). His book is a construct ion oriented toward the demonstration of a truth \u2014his calling as a writer \u2014 that can be uttered only at the end. We also know that the final epis ode that makes the truth burst forth, during the matin\u00e9e at the house of the Prince de Guermantes, was one of the first written by Proust. Time Regained comes to this renewed faith in literature and in his own talents only after a very long detour. My article wants to revisit two appearances of George Sand's Fran\u00e7ois le Champi/Fran\u00e7ois the Waif at both ends of A la R echerche du temps perdu and look at the origins of Proust's calling. His early involvement with literature and the retelling at the end of the novel of the moment when the narrator, now an old man, discovers the book in the Guermantes 's library will be the focus of this essay. More specifically, I would like to interrogate the place of Sand's novel within Proust's opus and the part it plays in the definition of literary vocation for Proust. The two encounte rs with the novel stand at the two poles of the nar rator's life : the book first appears in the 'Combray' Grauby 'Sand's Way' PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 2 section in Swann 's Way and it reappears at the moment of apparent illumination regarding his future as a writer in Time Regained , when he finds renewed faith in literature and in his own literary talent s. The narrator connects intimately with the voices at play in Sand's novel, which is delivered to him through the voi ce of his mother. The discovery, incarnation and integration of voices will ulti mately constitute a fertile ground on which the narrator w ill build his own creation. They will also form part of a larger search for the personal within the collective. The narrator first hears the story of Fran\u00e7ois le Champi during the famous 'good -night kiss scene.' The narrator, then about 10 years old, want s a good -night kiss from his mother and becomes so agitat ed that she decides to spend the night with him to calm him down , and reads him a story. The protagonist, despite having committed 'une faute telle que on'1 (Proust 1954: I, 49), is paradoxically awarded with possession of his mother for one night. The book she reads tells a simple story , the awakening of love between the young miller's wife Madeleine Blanchet and her adoptive son, Fran\u00e7ois, who was aband oned in the fields (hence his name Champi, literally 'field -boy') and whom she has brought up as her son. One can see the parallel between the intense and passionate love felt by the narrator for his mother and the (incestuous) love between the character s in the story. Several critics, from Didier (1981) to Kristeva (1994) , have commented on the symbolic connexions between the two love stories, but few have discussed the oral tradition at play in similar ways in both novels . Fran\u00e7ois le Champi is a story taken from the oral tradition of Berry, Sand's native region . Both stories involve a storyteller and an audience. In the context of literary vocation, this seems import ant. Vocation ( vocare : the act of calling ) involves a voice ( from above ) that ultimately will give the order to write, when the narrator is ready to hear 'the calling .' George Sand wrote several rural novels drawing from her childhoo d experiences of the Berry . The story of Fran\u00e7ois le Champi, written in 1850, is part of a series of three stories, compiled under the title of Veill\u00e9es du chanvreur .2 The story is told by two alternating voices. One is feminine, the old woman/grand -mother/parish priest's servant 1 'a sin so deadly tha t I expected to be banis hed from the household' (Proust 2003: 40-41). 2 The Hemp -twiner's Tales is one of Sand's three pastoral novels , the other two being La Mare au diable (The Devil's Pool) and La petite Fadette (Fadette), all published between 1847 and 1848. What unites these three texts is the semi -mythical character of the hemp twiner telling his sto ries at night. Grauby 'Sand's Way' PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 3 whose function is to tell the story of the childhood and adolescence of Fr an\u00e7ois. Th e other is masculine, the hemp -twiner who narrates the actual love story between the two protagonists. These two voices are depicted as inspired and gifted: the y know how to convey a story and to bring it to life. One can also note that the ma sculine voice will be more daring in that it will tell the part of the story which is , after all, in the traditional 19th-century rural society of Berry, a n immoral and incestuous tale, that of a mother who ends up marrying her adoptive son. As is often the case, the story is told during a veill\u00e9e , at night. The veill\u00e9e is a genre in itself: it is a signal to sit co mfortably and pay attention to a real -life narrator. The audience is composed of young people, young girls in particular, which means t hat some precautions in the telling of the story are necessary: 'je sais que je parle devant des jeunesses, et ne dirai parole de trop'3 (Sand 1960: 279) . As is often the case with the oral tradition, there are no definite or 'true' versions of the story: variations are inc luded in the material and the listeners shape the emerging story for t hemselves. By nature, oral tales are 'promiscuous and omnivorous ... Motifs and plotlines are nomadic' says 'L'\u00e9criture mot,'4 comments Belmont (Belmont 2005: 24). Thus George Sand is only faithful t o the story to the extent that she is faithful to its fundamental oral mode o f expression, to the regional Berrichon expressions and to the beliefs and representations of a traditional rural world. The characters, for example, are not talkative and are often ignorant of the origin of their feelings. Love between the two characters, Fran\u00e7ois and Ma deleine, is not declared openly but evolves secretly and silently under the surface, goe s through many twists and turns until an inner voice speaks the truth of the revelati on. Et Madeleine ... comprit mieux que par des paroles que ce enfa nt le champi, qui sans par la vigne \u00e0 la 402 )5 3 'I know that I am speaking before young people, and I shall not say a word too much' (Sand 1930: 187). 4 'Writing makes a story a definit ive text though told orally, it is never the same because it cannot be memorised word for word .' All translations are my own with the exception of publishe d translations of Proust's and Sand's works. 5 'she understood, better than if he had spoken, that it was no longer her child, the waif, but her lover Fran\u00e7ois, that walked by her side. And after they ha d gone a little distance, silent, but linked arm in arm, as vine is interlaced with vine, Fran\u00e7ois said: \"Let's go to the fountain, perhaps I may find my tongue there \"' (Sand 1930: 280). Grauby 'Sand's Way' PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 4 Silence and pauses seem to be called upon so that feelings can blossom and grow. Thi s evokes a rural world in which, as it is with the land, it is better to let things grow naturally, with as little human interventio n as possible : gel\u00e9e ...'6 (Sand 1960: 204) . This laconicism is include d in the rhythm of the story itself as Sand wants to emphasise the instinctive poetry of the rural region and its people: 'Les chansons, les d\u00e9guiser'7 (Sand 1960: 211) . Sand's ultimate aim is to give a voice, through her stories, to this provincial world in which no one is torment ed by the desire to give an account of their inner life to others , in which feelings do not emerge fully but remain on the verg e of consciousness and are stronger for it . The narration itself is highly staged: it is a recounted story and t he objections from the storytellers themselves and/or the author regularly intrude upon the narr ation, 'providing a double 1992: 342). Bakhtin's concept of heteroglossia challenges the idea of a fixed monolingua l discourse in a text and encourages the recognition of ' a diversity of social speech types ... and a diversity of individual voices, arti stically organised' (Bakhtin 1981: 262). In the novel's preface (in the form of a dialogue between two artists), Sand mentions that she is aiming at hy bridity: a story told by and for simple people, using dialect and peasant idiom, but connecting with Parisien parlant un paysan devant lequel tu ne voudrais pas dire une phrase, un mot o\u00f9 il ne pourrait pas p\u00e9n\u00e9trer' (Sand 1960: 217).8 In a sense, the voices of the hemp the priest's servant, other 'paysanne un peu cultiv\u00e9e'9 (Sand 1960: 217) provide a successful compro mise between familiarity and intelligibility. 6 'At the approach of the long winter sleep, it seems as if every creature and thing stealthily agreed to enjoy what is left of life and animation before the deadly t orpor of the frost' (Sand 1930: 131 ). 7 'Songs, ballads a nd rustic tales say in a few words what our literature can only a mplify and disguise ' (Sand 1930: 135 -136). 8 'Come, begin, tell me the story of the 'Waif ,' but not in the way you and I heard it last night ... Tell it to me as if you had on your right hand a Parisian speaking the modern tongue, and on your left a peas ant before whom you were unwilling to utter a word or phrase which he could not understand' (Sand 1930: 139-140). 9 'he was uneducated, but happily gifted by nature and endowed with a certain rud e eloquence ,' 'she was a peas ant-woman of some slight 139 ). Grauby 'Sand's Way' PORTAL Nous avons assist\u00e9 hier \u00e0 ils nous ont racont\u00e9 une ? - Parfaitement, \u00e0 mot dans leur langage. (Sand 1960: 216 -217)10 This juxtaposition expresses a conception of art at the opposite pole from the perfection of the artwork: it is an attempt to render authenticity (with a n accent on 'attempt'). Sand's decision to find a new language and emphasise orality, spontaneity and the interaction that comes from communal storytelling is a risky one but she fully accepts and understands the possibility of trial and error . To write oral tales during the mid - nineteen th century was to challenge author ity and the unquestionable cultural hegemony of Parisian literary life with a populist form, to promote the values of the French regions, and to reject the conventional generic structure of the novel. The so -called 'province' was considered a foreign land by the Parisians, and the different provinces were perceived as 'petites r\u00e9publiques, dont chacune a ses lois, ses usage ses H\u00e9ros, ses opinions politiques' (Janin 2003: 15) . Behind this challenge lies a struggle for cultural dominance, expr essed by a debate about what authentic expression is; whether it is written or oral, whether it comes from the provinc es or from Paris. The story thus appears at the frontier of two worlds (regional/Pari sian), two representations (nature/culture), two lan guages (dialect/French), two (feminine/masculine), two generations (young/old), two ways of expressi ng emotions (by telling/by silence) , two ways of telling a story (oral ly/in writing) and, finally, two approaches ( instinctive , as produced by the la nd/nature itself, and intellectual , as retold by an artist). Beyond this bipolar artistic model, one should not overlook the polyphonic nature of the story . The novel is staging a process of narration as collective, commu nal, heteroglossic , in an attempt t o find one's voice through the childhood land and the original patois. 10 'we were present last evening at a rustic gathering at the farm, and the hemp -dresser told a story until two o'clock in the morning. The priest's servant helped him with h is tale, and resumed it when he stopped; she was a peas ant-woman of some slight education ; he was uneducated, but happily gifted by nature and endowed with a certain rude eloquence . Between them they related a true story, which was rather long, and like a simple kind o f novel. Can you remember it? \u2014Perfectly, and I could repeat it word for word in their language' (Sand 1930: 139). Grauby 'Sand's Way' PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 6 The story is, above all, a reflection on voice as theme and enunciation, mixing old songs, different accents, inner voices (the voice of God, of the fairies11 and the supernatural are an integral part of the story , for instance Fran\u00e7ois's inner voice tells him whom to court and love). There are also the voice of the manual labourer (the hemp -twiner is working on the hemp while he is telling the story) and the voice of the art ist trying to recapture all these voices. We should add here the presence of another voice: that of Sand the mother, who, before or during the writing of her stories, tested them on her own children and grandchildren , before bedtime .12 So the story retains something of its viva voce origins. Anne Berger rightly points out that the Contes champ\u00eatres inscribe or represent orality in the written text (Berger 1987). Finding one's voice, a voice that would render all voices in their authent icity, is thus at the centre of the story of Fran\u00e7ois le Champi . A crucial element for Sand is to find the right balance between emotions and the intellect, to make these voices agree and negotiate, to diffuse tensions and potential conflict in order to create harmony between the voices; each voice pulling gently in its direction so that none is neglected but none is dominant. It is a celebration of the oral in the literary, a c elebration of freedom, authenticity and lack of constraint. It is, in the words of Tim Fa rrant : 'word -spinning, freewheeling, vibrant' (Farrant 2010: 87) . The result is a story that is pure telling without the showing , in which many voices can cohabit so harmoniously that no one, young or old, conservative or educated, can ultimately be shocked by what the story i s telling. The artful way in which Sand disguises the crux of the matter means that someone like Marcel's mother, to go back to Remembrance , will read this story to her young son, at a time when he is cl aiming her as his possession. It is indeed ironic tha t Sand's style, which is most revered by Marcel's mother and grandmother, can allow this mythic story of for bidden love, under the guise of a bucolic and provincial world, to be read to a child who is obsessed by the love of his mother. But I deliberately want to avoid the dipal implications of the 11 One can note that the etymology of ' f\u00e9e' comes from 'fatum' (destiny) and the verb 'fari' (to speak ). Words and destiny are int ertwined to describe what fairies represent in fairy -tales ( a form of oracle ). 12 Implying a constant toing -and-froing between oral and written versions within a family circle. Sand also assimilates , in her work and in her life, the act of caring for a chi ld with writing (at night). The 'veill\u00e9e' is also singular: it is when she chose to write, while looking after her sleeping children. Just like the Proustian narrator's mother, she is actively creating (p erforming a story) while looking after a child. Both missions appear equally important. Grauby 'Sand's Way' PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 7 nocturnal bedroom scene between mother and son and go back to the voice, and, ultimately, vocation. Marcel's mother reads the story to him at night (the night sess ion recalls the 'veill\u00e9e'/fireside story in the farm or a barn of the original story), providing another voice and another layer in the heteroglossia, cunningly coupling the masculine and the feminine (the young Marcel believe s that Sand is a masculine author because of her masculine pen name), takin g on multiple roles, playing each character. The book also comes to him with a certain prestige attached to it, having been carefully selected by his grandmother for his birthday, for its moral quality and impeccable style. Like the oral stories told commu nally, it is also aimed at a young audience. Orality is not reduced to vocal action. According to Paul Zumthor (1983), it integrates facial and body gestures. By staging a performance, the mother brings the voices to life and participates actively in the discovery of his literary vocation: the narrator mentions that the 'phrases sa voix' (Proust 1954: The voice of the mother unites with Sand's story and mission, just as if she had found instinctively , underneath the surfa ce, what binds the text together: Sand's vision and feelings, her goodness,14 her doctrines of love, progress and reconciliation, and her connect ion to the rural world, trying to embrace a whole community : 'c'est la continuit\u00e9 de cette voix (Didier 1990: 296).15 This is a scene of transmission of knowledge through the mot her's tongue. Not only does Marcel's mother convey the multiplicity and hybridity that so characterise the book (writing, reading, translating at the same time), she also changes the original text. F aithful, in that respect, to the idea of oral variation s, she does not read love scenes, deemed too frank for a young reader , thus adding another layer of silence to the original text .16 By slightly altering the text, she r einforces the mysterious power of 13 'sentences ... seemed written for her voice' ( Proust 2003 : 45). 14 The goodness and generosity of the mother and grandmother of Marcel are often commented upon in Proust's novel . 15 'it is the continuity of the voices of the grandmothers that George Sand let s us hear, the permanence of the oral tradition th anks to women. Through this continuity, ancient voices can be heard .' 16 In a similar way, Madeleine will bond with Fran\u00e7ois when she reads him Biblical stories (she will also rearrange some passages of the Gospels and the lives of the saints) . Grauby 'Sand's Way' PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 8 the novel: the incomprehensibility of the patois words, the incoherences due to the omissions or the daydreamings of the boy cultivate the belief of the young na rrator that the book is unique and that the story, despite or because of its strangenes s, is written solely for him: 'c'est cet enfant que le livre av ait appel\u00e9 tout de suite, ne voulant \u00eatre regard\u00e9 que par ses yeux, aim\u00e9 ne (Proust 1954 : VIII, 243 clearly exerts a strong magnetic or quasi -mystical pull on the boy. It is then no accident that all these e lements (an intimate audience of one, a voice deployed in a circ umscribed spa ce, a unique story recounted in real time) , converge toward the child, here and now, to create a circular and sacred s pace, a stage of a sort, cut from the continuum of social and family life, related to the sacral, so that a kind of prophecy can take place. Reading out loud 'd\u00e9finit ainsi un between mother and child, jo ining sacred space and earthly room. The fact that the story is told by someone invested with special powers/authority \u2014one must note here the force of breath, prevalent in the doctrine of i nspiration: 'elle insufflait \u00e0 cette prose si commune et 55)20\u2014tends to heighten its power over the boy. What we are shown here is an Annunciation \u2014tradit ionally a woman's scene \u2014which acts as of another scene from Fran\u00e7ois le Champi , where Madeleine reads to Fran\u00e7ois and teaches him how to read: 'la dimension consommation du livre'21 comments ( Berger 1987: 81) The Annunciation intertext suggests between God's intercessor and the Verb, bringing togethe r the power of words and notions of agency, intimating that somethin g miraculous has happened: he has been chosen by God. As the archangel Gabriel tells Mary that she is to conceive a 17 '[the child] brought to me only by the book, this child has instantly summoned him to its presence, wanting to be seen only by his eyes, to be loved onl y by his heart , to speak on ly to him' (Proust 1992: 240). 18 'thus defines an intimate space , not only physical, but also spir itual, which encourages bonding' 19 'she [the mother] breathed into this very common prose a sor t of continuous emotional life' (Proust 2003: 45). 20 'always br eathes that goodness, that moral distinction which Mama had learned from my grandmother to consider superior to all else in life ...' (Proust 2003: 45). 21 'the dimension of speech is maintained and founds the plea sure of consuming the book in the union of mouth and ears.' Grauby 'Sand's Way' PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 9 son, the mother, recognising the sensitive nature of her son, singularis es the future writer and imbues him with a sense of mission: ' l'Anno nciation s'av\u00e8re \u00eatre dans la Recherche une structure riche en implications, structure souple (adaptable \u00e0 la transgression des cat\u00e9gories sexuelles) en m\u00eame persistant e'22 write s (1992: 91) . The narrator will never describ e at leng th what the book is about but will emphasise these three elements: the haunting motif of the mother's voice; the enigma of the book (in particular the patois word champi ); the singularity of that night and that book, which appear to the young boy to be made just for him . Like the dreams that form part of the narrator's inner world, the story is entirely formed of disconnected images that will stay imprinted at a profound level in his memory. These elements (the voice, the mystery and the singularity) captu re the mythical elements necessary to set a scene of revelation. The emphasis is not on the love story between Madeleine and Fran\u00e7ois (in which it is accepted that a young s on can marry his mother) but on the setting of a calling. The voice of the mother s ummons a child in order for him to hear his destiny. And what is vocation after all if not the careful and long selection, between the myriad voices, of that unique voice that wi ll take the writer to the discovery of what he is made for? This is exactly wh at happens in t he final volume, when the narrator arrives at the realisation of what he is and what he wants to do. The calling is fully heard in the final volume, a delay that might be read, as in Fran\u00e7ois le Champi , as an expression of nature taking its time. Fran\u00e7ois le Champi does reappear in the final scenes of Time Regained , in the Prince de Guermantes's bookcase, when the narrator finally grasps his calling and can free himself of years of procrastination (but, as we have seen, procrastination plays its part, it is the time one needs to bring the calling to maturity: 'Les vrais livres doivent \u00eatre les la causerie mais de l'obscurit\u00e9 et du 260 ). 22 'the Annunciation proves to be within la Recherche a structure rich with implications, supple (adaptable to the transgression of sexual categories) and at the same time, persistent .' 23 'real books should be the offspring not of daylight an d casual talk but o f darkness and silence' (Proust 1992: 257). Silence plays also an important part in the structure of t he book, as Proust is very delibera tely hiding elements that could, first, make his discovery about time too literal and obvious , or se cond, appear too dogmatic or philosophical to the readers. Keeping the r eader a little behind, a little deaf and blind, is Grauby 'Sand's Way' PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 10 His meditation on the place the book occupie s occurs in a moment of apparent illumination, after a series of signs that all seem to point t owards the rediscovery of literature. Again, the narrator does not describ e at length what the book is about but this time he emphasises different elements, movi ng away from the theatrical elements and the process of narration as collective and dialogised. As we have not ed, the original story read to him gave a communal point of view and emphasised meaningful connections to the voices of others, through the unifyi ng voice of the mother. In many ways, the book was a product of her voice and also of her taste in nove ls (and that of her own mother). The rediscovery of the book brings back to the forefront its title, Fran\u00e7ois le Champi , that becomes an insistent leit motif throughout the passage, with, at its centre, the name of the boy . Now, the character, his name, and his forceful efforts to push the plot forward are given preeminence : it is the quest/the tribulations of the hero that are important, his vicissitudes , his resilience, his power of invention, his creative forces , his ultimate success . The story has moved from the communal to the agentic. Fran\u00e7ois comes from nothing and wins everything. Once he knows what he wants and can identify his allies, he pursues his aim with determination.24 The fascination of the narrator does not thus reside in the book itself but in the title which carries his memories (it belongs undoubtedly to the family of poet ic names such as Guermantes, Balbec, and Parme. whose sounds and colours fill the narrator with awe) and provides the solidity of a foundation: Fran\u00e7ois le Champi is, at the same time, a name, a situation ('champi,' a child without a father), a place (a regional dialect, the countryside of Sand) and a journey. All thes e elements will lead the narrator to discover that his own book, the book he has been longing to write, will also be about a boy and a quest. He is, ultimately, as Fran\u00e7ois is, the subject of this book: 'Et VIII, 262). By quoting repeatedly the title of the original book, the narrator adopts an identity and a singularity in order to start writing. It is an impulse to writ e, a call to act. The name also a deliberate technique on Proust's part in order to control the distribution o f information. The reader is just as the narrator was as a child, victim of the same ecstatic dazzleme nt. 24 In the classification of traditional oral stories , Fran\u00e7ois le Champi belongs to the 'conte -nouvelle,' in which an autonomous young boy or girl journeys from the family home until he or she finds fo rtune or makes a good marriage , without any supernatural interventions. (Belmont 2005: 19). 25 'And I understood that all these materials for a work of literature were simply my past life' (Proust 1992: 258). Grauby 'Sand's Way' PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 11 Fran\u00e7ois also fo rms a strange echo with the name of his maid Fran\u00e7oise, whom he likens to his writing double. Both are domestics involved with manual la bour, and the narrator will identify his writing techniques to the activities of Fran\u00e7oise the 'mender ,' establishing a link between her creativity and his. This is also evocative of the manual labour of the hemp -twiner , artist of a sort, talking and singing while he works . The older and more critical narrator comments on the style of Sand to note that he has adopted a mor e critical stance. He refers here to Sand's idealism and 'f eminine' generosity and goodness, for which she was praised by his mother and grandmothe r. However, he has managed to reverse his mother's tastes and teach her literary appreciation: 'Certes, la 'p lume' de George Sand ... tout , comme magique'26 (Proust 1954: VIII, 244). In matters of literary taste, the son has become the m aster and declares that Sand is not a supreme novelist. This distancing principle does not prevent some kind of magic from taking pl ace however: it in no way precludes a profound empathy with the book. The enchant ment is still present after all these yea nous alors'27 (Proust 1954: VIII, 244) because he able to conjure up recollections of his past, imagination taking over, fuelled by a firm consciousness of his own creative forces. If Fran\u00e7ois le Champi is not such a remarkable book pas un livre bien extraordinaire' (Proust 1954: VIII, 243), who has ordered the chain of memories and resurrected the past if not himself? Only he can magnify the book and grant himself power of epiphany. The rediscovery of the book inaugurates t he narrator's real writing career: communal collaboration has become one singular voice assuming control with a great er emotional distance, away from sentimentality and idealism, recognising and embr acing his own creative desire. By emphasising the name of the hero, discarding Sand's style and 26 'Admittedly the 'pen' of George Sand ... no long er seemed to me, as for so long it had seemed to my mother before she had gradually come to model her lit erary tastes upon mine, in the least a magic pen ' (Proust 1992: 240). 27 'a thing which we have looked at in the past brings back to us, if we see it ag ain, not only the eyes with which we looked at it but all the images with which at the time those eyes were filled ' (Proust 1992: 241 ). 28 'a pen which unintentionally 'Sand's Way' PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 12 asserting his taste, the narrator reappropriates the book as his own, analyses its magical properties and asserts his own creation by playing a more active role . Where he had to listen to a voice, he knows now how to summon it and give it shape. It is, as Doubrovsky puts In that respect, the only negotiation and reconciliation is with himself. The fusion is now with the name and not with the mother's voice. One source of the image of the magnetised pen seems to be Plato's Ion, in which Socrates offers the metaphor of a magnet to explain how the rhapsode tr ansmits the poet's original inspiration from the Muse to the audience. Socrates likens this magnetic attraction to the power of the Muse, who inspires poets and, through t hem, a 'chain' of other men. T he magnetic stone of Herakles, like the magnetic pen of Sand, is a nalogous to the possession and inspiration of a poet by the Muse, creating a 'chain of inspired beings' travelling from place to place to tell their story/recite the ir poems and communicate the message from the gods. Indeed, if the narrator places his efforts under the aegis of predec essors to bask in the reflected light of a cohort of models , instinc tive artists and myths from the past (the nomadic background of the hemp -twiner is also acknowledged), there remains the possibility of a community necessary to establish the seriousness of hi s creative ambitions. In yet another sense, the mother's voice and the storytell ers of the past could be seen as two sides of the same coin, as the former proved an i ncentive to interrogate the latter. Such an identification does not exclude affirmation of his own p erspective and the construction of a personal locus30 but the all -important notion of filiation must not be overlooked. Knowing oneself as a writer is crucially linked to knowing one's place within a literary genealogy. What is important here is not that t he narrator suddenly decides to write \u2014some scholars have underlined the fact that nothing suggests that the narrator is not , after all , going to 29 'the only way to give birth to oneself'; 'to be oneself is to find one's voice (way) ' 30 'Quant au livre i nt\u00e9rieur for the inner book of unknown symbols ... to read them was an act of creation in which no one ca n do our work for us or even collaborate with us' (Proust 1992: 233). Grauby 'Sand's Way' PORTAL , no. 2, July 2015. 13 continue his procrastination31\u2014but that, upon seeing the book Fran\u00e7ois le Champi he creates a mythology of his o wn by reappropriating a text populated with the intentions of his mother and grandmother, distancing himself from the lyrical a nd romantic style of Sand (that his mother adopts and adapts so well) and forging a path of autonomy, acknowledging his own agenc y: it is he (his memories) weaving together layers of the past (like the hemp -twiner), drawing connections, extracting the essence of the book. His theories (however tentative) are thus in counterpoint to Sand's t ext and function as his own creative act. Finally, the narrator quotes the text as an example of what such cr eation might be, to exemplify and prophesise what his future book should be. H e has been touched by the magnetic force of literature that binds him to a chain. So the r eading scene does no t so much instigate writing as forge a connection with a chain of storytellers, poets and writers whose voices come together to form his own . This brings us back to the oral tradition in Fran\u00e7ois le Champi . The story itself contributes to the gen eral feel ing of confusion and my stery necessary to imbue the moment with magical properties. The narrator is mesmerised by a voice telling a story about voices . And the mother's voice is simply the best vessel to convey the calling because she 're-oralise s' and 're-originalises' a story that has been written down \u2014from oral story to book and back to oral story, in a reverse trajector y, forging a bond between time and place . By choosing to record this moment in written form, the narrator not only reconnects the links but also records his act as a writer. This transitory return to 'vocality' (Zumthor 1983) is physically and psychically effective because the text is momentarily freed from written constraints and transmitted in the present moment, through the body of the mother, in the warmth of an interpersonal moment. This quintessential embodiment, and the attunement to the quality of voice, elemental rhythms and flows of the original text pr ovide a privileged mode of access to creation. If, in a sense, the mother expr esses her creativity through reading, the narrator mirrors her dedication and transfers one craft to another, in a quest to bond the writer with the storyteller. 31 See Genette (1969: 234 -235) and Gray -McDonald: 'The embracing of literature may not, in fact, be the successful completion of Marcel's artistic quest and the \"happy ending \" with which many readers no. 2, July 2015. 14 The vocality in the text is transmitted through a chain of artists from different backgrounds (old servant/hemp -twiner/Sand (the mother who writes)/Madame Proust (the mother who reads)) but it also creates a setting, an annuncia tion of a sort (voice is authority from the past). It also combines the physical (the presence of the body, even manual la bour: traditionally the hemp -twiner would work while telling his story ) and the intellectual and the artistic (always reworked and transform ed by variations, pauses, suspenses and omissions, placed at different moments). The voice, i n short, penetrates deeper, ferments and grows. It carries a message that may take years to find its object: the love of the Champi/the literary vocation of Marcel; to be in the service of Madeleine for Fran\u00e7ois/ to be in the service of the madeleine for the other. The way the moment of revelation is expressed in Fran\u00e7ois le Champi mirrors the quest of the narrator in La Recherche : 'il venait de se sentir br\u00fbl\u00e9 pour a cendre' (Sand 1960 : 392).'32 After years of more or less comfortable procrastination, the narrator suddenly ties all the lo ose ends together and understands what is at work within him. Not love, not art, but a process of composition, that is, crea tion.

(Bachelard 1969: 6) In 2013 I lived in Vietnam. Once a year, the Vietnamese people have a particular tradition called khom t, where the people set out a guest table filled with a delicious feast of food and paper clothing, shoes, accessories and money for the s pirits of the house. Khom in khom t means a set of rituals or a prayer to bow down and pay respect. t means land. This is a ritual that acknowledges the spirits within the home and the agency that those spirits have with respect to the home. There would be separate rituals for different types of spirits and incense would burn as an offering in various household places. For example, an incense and food offering would be on an altar directly above the fire stove in the kitchen, a sign for residents to be grateful to the fire spirit of the home. There is a belief that if the fire spirit gets angry, t hen the spirit may be a danger to the family. The spirit has the agency and a power over the home. T his then is a ritual for recognising that a home has its ghosts, its history and its spiri ts that reside long before the current people residents and that those spirits have the powe r to protect or destroy. Mostly, the ritual tells us to recognise that land and place are not to be owned, Ngo Intersecting Homeliness PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 2 and matters such as fire or water or wood are not mere commoditie s. Rather, these materialities are living and only would be at our disposal to help us when they are given respect and the recognition that they are living and are powerful age nts. Within the Vietnamese language, there is no specific word for diffe rentiating between 'home' and 'house' ; rather, Vietnamese people use the word 'house' to mean both the building and the home \u2014nh\u00e0\u2014(rather than state, 'I go home,' one states literally, 'I return to the house' \u2014T\u00f4i v nh\u00e0). To say house rather than home could mean that home is not to be possesse d, but has its own agency, vitality and spirit. With this in mind, I want to tell you about a particular uncanny phenomenon t hat happened in my family home in Strathfield, Sydney \u2014a loved family home where my family still resides \u2014that occurred ten years ag o and that, to this day, has not escaped any of our memories. By recounting this phenomenon, I hope to capture, in a self- reflexive way, the merging of the past and the present within the Vi etnamese migrant experience living in the Australian landscape, wi th its dark history of the forced displacement of Indigenous peoples. I wish to mourn and acknowledge that the land that has given my refugee family the opportunity to begin life safely and f reely, and that is my birthplace, is a stolen land. And, therefor e, we are always both grateful for, and in mourning with, our homeland. The land of my family home in Strathfield has varying textures, varying levels. On the outer layer of the land, the soil is powdered, providing a beautiful fa\u00e7ade of smoothness. It sm ells sweet and musky, like dried fruit. My father is the gardener . He made the garden in a formal European style, almost as a way for the famil y to integrate or to have the feeling of belonging in the Europeanised surroundings of Australia. Just half a m etre below this powdered and smooth soil, you meet rough, older soil, clumpy and annoying. Through the moisture of the land and its own decay, the many fragmented roots of trees, plants, and weeds that had formerly stood on this land are pulped within this soil. This soil's varying textures are hard to grasp; the smal l fragments of stone and roots and unknown bits stab the hands like fragments of the finest glass. Other parts of this soil have an unexpected touch of oil iness, an unknown thickness that is st icky. The smell of the soil is unpleasant, with a certain str ange sourness lingering in the air. Ngo Intersecting Homeliness PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 3 The traditional owners and custodians of the land of my house are the Wanga l people of the Darug tribe (Darug can also be spelt as Dharug). This land, t he land of Strathfield, was an important place for the culture and livelihood of these people. The European settlement of Strathfield began in 1793. The Wangal peopl e were driven away from the land after this settlement, a land that was the ir home, their sou rce of food, a part of themselves. Armed soldiers were sent out by Lieut enant -Governor Grose to drive the Wangal people out of the land of my house (Strathfield H eritage 2015). I cannot find information about what happened to them afterwards. Even now , the Strathfield Heritage website actually says that these people mos t likely never lived in Strathfield but just used the land for hunting and gathering food.1 It was almost as if to 1 The Strathfield Heritage website states : 'It is unlikely that the Strathfield district was a pl ace of permanent camping for the Wangal people, as Strathfield does not contain rock shelters or overhangs sui table for camping. Rather the plentiful eucalypt trees, native grasses and access to the Cooks and Parramatta Rivers made Strathfield a likely place for gathering or hunting food by the Wangal people, a c ostal clan of the Darug tribe. As an important sourc e of food, Strathfield may have been an integral part of the Wangal clan's territory' (Strathfield Heritage 2015) .

Between 1789 and 1790 the introduction of smallpox to the Darug tribe by the E uropean settlers killed thousands (Kohen 1985). Although there were no records, it is likely that within the first three years of the European settlement, over half the Darug tribe died of smallpox. A report from Governor Arthur Phillip (1789) stated the foll owing: numbers of the natives were found dead with the smallpox ... It is not possible to determine the number o f natives who were carried off by this fatal diseas e. It must be great... and as natives always retired from where the disorder appeared, and which some must have carried with them, it must have been spread to a considerable distance, as well inland as along the coast. We have seen traces of it wherever we have been. (Campbell 2002 : 88) My family began to notice a curious, pimply group of orange mushrooms grow ing around the garden. They started to grow at the side of the house and wit hin a week they had spre ad to all the garden beds. We all found them perplexing and extraordinaril y disgusting to look at. My father in particular found them puzzling; he is a professional gardener and had never seen them before. One night, as we sat in the garden, we smelt an a wful stench. My parents recognised the smell as similar to rotting dead corpse. Such a thick and abject smell; it was musty, acidic, decayed. It confronted us like a veil. It came over the hous e. The smell came from the mushrooms. We began to kill off the mushrooms. With long sticks, we slashed them down whilst keeping our distance from them. But they continued to grow. They spread. It would be weeks later that they disappeared as quickly as they had come. A few years later, from a rather incidental s earch on the internet, we realised that these things were not mushrooms. They were flowers with no stem or roots , from the Rafflesia genus. They are even known locally as 'corpse flowers' due to their stench. They grow in water -based landscapes such as ma rshes or in the tropical forests of South East Asia. For them to flourish and grow in abundance in Strathfie ld, Australia, a considerably dr ier environment, seemed ghostly \u2014that abstract body of the past. For my family (who happen to come from South East Asi a) and for my home, they were an Ngo Intersecting Homeliness PORTAL , vol. 12, no. 2, July 2015. 5 uncanny phenomen on, these mushrooms that grow upon invisible South East Asian waters. The Aboriginal conception of body is that body is part of land, land is part of body; 'speech and sweat are seen to penetrate people an d places: speech goes in the human ear and travels through the air, sweat comes out of the body and sinks into w aterhole (the earth pores or ear channels)' (Rose 2002: 320). Aboriginal bodies of the Darug were killed by massacres and sickness : 'By 1840 there were fewer than 300 Dharug Aborigines left alive, only about 10% of the original population in 1788' (Kohen 1985: 22). The land, being part of the killed bodies, expresses this silenced history, quietly and disquietly. Within this expression of the land \u2014the uncanny flowers smelling of corpses, the cries of a moving land. The land will always be drenched with the ghosts of the pasts, the qui et of its hidden tragedy, the heaviness of its disquiet. The (dis) quiet of home. When my family first moved into this home, we thought there were ghosts. Now we know there are ghosts. And the ghosts are crystallised in the land. A land loved, nurtured, tragic, homely and unhomely. Reference List Bachelard, G. 1969, The Poetics of Space , (trans.) M. Jolas. Bea con Press, Boston.
