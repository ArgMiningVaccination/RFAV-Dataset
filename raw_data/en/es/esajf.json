work and dedication of CAHS staff, while at the same time maintaining the quality of care that the Child and Adolescent Health Service is known for. Throughout the year, a number of the Board members have joined me to visit different areas of Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH), the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) and Child and Adolescent Community Health (CACH). This has enabled the Board to engage with staff in their own environments, receiving direct feedback on issues related to these areas and ensuring the Board's decision making remains informed by knowledge of our service delivery. The Board has also established a Clinical Advisory Group to facilitate more engagement between the Board and staff across the organisation. The Board's standing committees of Finance, Audit and Risk and Safety and Quality have been extremely active this year.CAHS Board Chair Foreword THE BEST POSSIBLE HEALTH AND MEDICAL OUTCOMES The focus of the Child and Adolescent Health Service (CAHS) Board during 2017-18 has been to ensure the best possible health and medical outcomes for the children and young people of Western Australia at a time of great change. Audit and Risk The Board was pleased with the appointment of an Audit and Risk Manager and internal auditors reporting to the Board to operationalise the Board's responsibilities around these critical areas. The development of the organisation's risk appetite and tolerance statements and of an annual audit plan are among their first tasks. Safety and Quality At Princess Margaret Hospital, we have maintained oversight of critical targets and reports, and noted the improvements in the WA Emergency Access Targets and in hand hygiene. There have also been improvements in the completion of discharge summaries, although this remains a focus area for the Board, recognising the importance of a timely and seamless link between inpatient and community-based services. Finance Driving a sustainable health service has also occupied the Board, bringing further governance and accountability to financial decision making, financial results and key performance indicators, including oversight of leave balances. I am pleased that CAHS has met its targeted net cost of service and generated a small surplus for the year. CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE8 9 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE9 Other working groups Throughout the year, the Board has also had two time-limited working groups. The Review Oversight Committee was created to monitor the implementation of the recommendations of the independent review into staff engagement and morale conducted in the 2017 financial year. The Committee has been very pleased with the progress towards full implementation and has closed out several of the recommendations. The Board recognises that changing organisational culture is a long-term process, and although progress has been made, the Committee and the Board will continue to monitor progress in the coming year. The Perth Children's Hospital (PCH) Governance Transition Working Group was created to oversee the transfer of governance of PCH from the Department of Health and the Minister for Health to the CAHS Board. The transition process, including the many agreements, Memoranda of Understanding, transition plans, licenses and leases was complex and has required due consideration by the Board. The transition was completed successfully, and the Board took responsibility for the provision of services at PCH on 14 May 2018. Engagement with patients, families and partners The Board is acutely interested in hearing the voice of our clients and their families, and this year, a member of the CAHS Consumer Advisory Council has become a permanent invitee of the Board's Safety and Quality Committee. The Board has been investigating more ways of driving clinical DEBBIE KARASINSKI Chair CAHS Board excellence through incorporating the experiences of our children and their families, from the Voice of Family surveys, to analysing and responding to compliments and complaint data. The Board has been engaging with its many stakeholders, from the non-government organisation sector, who have been part of CAHS strategic planning processes, to the Australian Medical Association and Robyn Kruk AC, who led the Sustainable Health Review, which delivered its interim report in February 2018. Through doing this, the Board wants to confirm its vision of leading and providing governance to a world class service for children and young people by making sure it is fully informed of the needs of those it serves and with whom it partners. The move to PCH While the Board focused on the transfer of governance, many CAHS staff and others have been involved in the design, building, and commissioning of PCH. Their vision, expertise and commitment to excellence will have a life-long positive impact on the lives of young Western Australians, and their families, for generations to come and I wish to congratulate all the people involved. I would also like to acknowledge that in leaving PMH, we are leaving a much-loved institution, held dear in the hearts of many Western Australians, and I recognise the contribution of all who have worked at PMH, providing exceptional services for 109 years.Thank you I am immensely proud of all CAHS staff who have worked with dedication and commitment throughout the year to ensure the best health and medical outcomes for the children and young people of Western Australia, whose work has resulted in such positive results in the National Safety and Quality Health Service Accreditation review, who have participated with such enthusiasm in the Speaking Up for Safety program and the change management activities, who have been involved in the clinical commissioning of PCH, and who have joined the many activities to develop our Strategic Plan. I sincerely thank all those staff and our volunteers who have provided exemplary service and have worked so hard towards making CAHS a great place to work. I would like to acknowledge my fellow Board Members for the time and effort they apply to the discharge of their duties, and for the knowledge and experience they bring to the Board's discussions and decision making. To conclude, I would like to thank our Chief Executive (CE), Dr Robyn Lawrence for embracing and meeting the key objectives and challenges set by the Board on her commencement as CAHS CE. Robyn's personal integrity and commitment to excellence are exemplary and greatly appreciated. I extend my sincere thanks to our workforce; a dedicated and hard-working group of people, who have shown their commitment to the organisation during the challenging delays over recent years. Every individual who has worked on the building and works within the building should be proud to be part of this important moment in Western Australian history, as I am. At this time, it is also appropriate that the Child and Adolescent Health Service (CAHS) will commence operating under a new organisational structure, which reflects the modern health service we are. Significant work has been undertaken throughout the last 12 months in preparation for this change. From 1 July 2018, Perth Children's Hospital, Community Health and Mental Health programs will become a single service, support by directorates led by co- directors. As part of these changes, competitive recruitment processes have been undertaken for each role, and I acknowledge the substantial work that has occurred to ensure the new structure would be operational for the start of the 2018-19 financial year. I would also like to acknowledge the commitment of our staff to the Shape our Future program. Through the Shape our Future Steering Team and CAHS Cultural Ambassadors, a CAHS Culture Action Strategy has been developed and the health service vision and values were reviewed and updated with all staff and volunteers having the opportunity to provide input. I am delighted with the outcome of this work, the CAHS Strategic Plan 2018-2023, and particularly our updated values: compassion, respect, collaboration, equity, accountability and excellence, and aspirational vision - 'healthy kids, healthy communities'. Together, the values, objectives and vision will guide our organisational strategy development and inform the goals set to determine whether the strategy is on track. Most importantly, I am optimistic that they are representative of the health service we strive to be. The Strategic Plan will help Message from the Chief Executive PROUD TO BE PART OF WESTERN AUSTRALIAN HISTORY The conclusion of the 2017-18 financial year has brought with it the long awaited opening of Perth Children's Hospital (PCH). PCH is a beautiful, world-class facility that will benefit Western Australian children, their families and our staff for many years to come. CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE10 \" The strategic plan will help to provide staff and volunteers with a renewed feeling of purpose with the knowledge that our goals and values as a health service are shared.\" DR ROBYN LAWRENCE Chief Executiveto provide staff and volunteers with a renewed feeling of purpose with the knowledge that our goals and values as a health service are shared. The health service underwent Australian Council on Healthcare Standards accreditation in February 2018. I am extremely pleased with the outcome, with seven 'met with merit' results being awarded. The surveyors noted the positivity, passion and pride of our staff, which I am privileged to witness on a day to day basis. The surveyors also commented 'the organisation has done well to establish a robust and well- functioning governance system for quality and safety. The team were impressed with the values of the organisation, which were reflected within all conversations with staff'. While the accreditation process always places additional demands on our staff, I extend my thanks to all who were involved in preparing for the accreditation process, and for everyone involved over the week-long survey for articulating the great work that is undertaken every day at CAHS. Our volunteers are an important and valued part of our organisation, and I express my gratitude to every person who donates their time and talent to this health service; your contributions are sincerely appreciated. Finally, I would like to thank our non-government partner organisations for their ongoing support, particularly the Perth Children's Hospital Foundation and Telethon, who support thousands of our patients through their fundraising each year. As we look to the year ahead and the dual challenges that a brand new hospital and organisational restructure may present, I trust that our staff, volunteers, clients and their families can be comfortable we are heading in the right direction. CAHS has a proud history of putting children and young people and their families at the centre of everything we do, and I am confident that this focus will continue to be our strength for the future. The Speaking up for Safety program, in partnership with the Cognitive Institute, has been another highlight of the last 12 months. This important program is designed to empower every staff member to speak up whenever they are concerned about safety, and reinforces a workforce-wide culture that embraces safe and high quality care. Speaking up for Safety workshops have been held regularly throughout the year, led by our own CAHS Safety Champions. Consumer advisory groups continue to have an invaluable role in the health service. This year, Consumer Advisory Council (CAC) Chair Amanda Magraith and Youth Advisory Committee Chair (YAC) April Welsh resigned from their roles. I acknowledge Amanda's and April's vast contributions during their tenure, to CAHS as a whole as well as their involvement with the patient-focused design of Perth Children's Hospital. I welcome Margaret Wood as the incoming CAC Chair and Daniel Staer as incoming Chair of the YAC. I look forward to a similarly collaborative working relationship with both the CAC and YAC under Margaret and Daniel's direction. Volunteers continue to play an integral role within the health service. Our volunteer team at PCH continues to grow and provide support to families and staff in the Emergency Department, outpatients, on the wards, and in pre and post-theatre support to name a few. Diversity within the team has increased greatly and an 18 year old nursing student may find themselves working with a veteran of 30 years. 11 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE11 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE12The Health Service Board The CAHS Board is the governing body of CAHS.

Excellence - by striving to improve, we constantly get better and deliver better care. Proudly doing our best!Our vision Healthy kids, healthy communities After an official opening ceremony on 12 May 2018, the staged opening of PCH began on 14 May with the delivery of a number of outpatient clinics including ophthalmology, immunology and enuresis. Two weeks later, on 28 May, select elective surgery commenced, before the final move day on Sunday 10 June, when inpatients were transferred and the PCH Emergency Department opened. At this time, Princess Margaret Hospital for Children (PMH) was formally closed, after a proud 109 year history of delivering world-class care to the children of Western Australia. On 13 June 2018, patients from the specialist adolescent mental health unit at Bentley Hospital were transferred to PCH, and the Bentley Adolescent Unit was closed. Work to strengthen the relationship between the health service executive and the workforce has occurred through an organisational restructure and the introduction of cultural change initiatives including the Shape our Future program, under the leadership of Dr Robyn Lawrence. Staff engagement is integral to this strategy and for CAHS to realise its full potential as an exceptional, integrated health service that all staff members can be proud of. A comprehensive organisational restructure has taken place over the past year. As part of this, the structure realigned the existing PMH, Child and Community Health and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service executive structures into a single service, supported by Directorates with Co-Directors leading each of those Directorates. Significant work was undertaken throughout the year in time for the full implementation date of 1 July 2018. Each Executive role, as well as Co-Director positions, has undergone a competitive recruitment process to appoint our senior leaders across the organisation. As part of Shape our Future, a number of staff Cultural Ambassadors and the Shape our Future Steering Team were selected through an expression of interest process. The Steering Team has led the development of the CAHS Culture Action Strategy and reviewed the health service values and behaviours. The team is led by Chair, Professor David Forbes who is supported by Dr Asha Bowen as Deputy Chair. The Team worked alongside the Cultural Ambassadors to hold a series of focus groups across CAHS to seek staff input to shape the organisation's values and behaviours, as well as leading development of the CAHS Culture Action Strategy and contributing to strategic planning. As a result of this work, the CAHS Strategic Plan 2018-2023 was released in June 2018, which identifies a new vision statement to reflect the health service for a new generation - 'healthy kids, healthy communities'. Five strategic objectives have been identified to achieve this vision: 1. Care for children, young people and families 2. Value and respect our people 3. Provide high-value healthcare 4. Promote teaching, training and research 5. Collaborate with our partners The key organisational values that support this new vision and mission are compassion, respect, collaboration, equity, accountability and excellence. Executive Summary SHAPING OUR FUTURE The focus and key priorities of the 2017-18 financial year have been the move to Perth Children's Hospital (PCH) and building a positive relationship with the workforce to make the Child and Adolescent Health Service (CAHS) a great place to work while caring for the children and young people of Western Australia. CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE18 Strategic planning has been a key priority for the CAHS Board and Executive, who took part in strategic planning days in February through to May. The organisation also sought the views of many of its non-government partner organisations and other key stakeholders as part of this planning. Part of this broader piece of organisational development work is the Speaking up for Safety program, in partnership with the Cognitive Institute. This program empowers every staff member to speak up whenever they are concerned about safety and reinforces a workforce-wide culture that embraces safe and high quality care. To date, 1,583 staff members have attended the hour long training seminar. In February, CAHS hosted surveyors from the Australian Council on Healthcare Standards. During the five day survey, the surveyors visited 12 community sites and 34 hospital department and wards. There were over 30 meetings held and more than 200 staff involved in those meetings. The feedback from the surveyors was overwhelmingly positive, with seven 'met with merit' results being awarded. The surveyors were particularly impressed by the many staff who expressed positivity, passion and pride toward working at CAHS. For the second year running, CAHS has achieved a modest surplus, which for 2017-18 is 1.8 per cent of the total service costs, while delivering activity that is above target.19 Operational Structure 20 Legislation Enabling legislation The Child and Adolescent Health Service (CAHS) was established as a Board governed Health Service provider in the Health Services (Health Service Provider) Order 2016 made by the Minister for Health under section 32 of the Health Services Act 2016.

We aim to ensure that children and young people get the best start in life through health promotion, early identification and intervention and patient centred, family-focused care. The Child and Adolescent Health Service is made up of: Perth Children's Hospital Child and Adolescent Community Health Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service With the closure of Princess Margaret Hospital for Children (PMH) in June 2018, Perth Children's Hospital (PCH) is Western Australia's (WA) only dedicated paediatric hospital and provides tertiary services for the State. The new hospital includes an integrated paediatric research and education facility, and provides inpatient, ambulatory and outpatient services with increased bed capacity to its predecessor. Further to this, PCH is the home of WA's only paediatric trauma centre. All specialist services previously provided by PMH are available at PCH, with many clinical areas expanded including an increase in neonatal and oncology capacity, an expanded Surgical Day Stay Unit and the introduction of a High Dependency Unit alongside the Intensive Care Unit. Child and Adolescent Community Health (CACH) provides a comprehensive range of community- based early identification and intervention services, as well as health promotion, to children and families in the Perth metropolitan area. Services are provided in a variety of settings including homes, local community health centres, child and parent centres and schools. CACH provides services across the Perth metropolitan area, which covers 7,250 square kilometres. CACH is also responsible for the provision of Statewide child health policies. The Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) provides mental health services to infants, children, young people and their families across the Perth metropolitan area. Services include community-based programs as well inpatient care and a range of specialised services for children with complex mental health conditions across the State. Shared responsibilities with other agencies CAHS' ability to partner with other organisations, both government and non-government, is integral to delivering health services successfully. CAHS partners with a large number of community and non-profit organisations that make significant contributions to support our patients, clients, families and carers. In delivering care, CAHS works closely with numerous agencies, including, but not limited to the Mental Health and Disability Services Commissions and the Departments of Health, Education, Aboriginal Affairs, Communities, and Justice, and the Health and Disability Service Complaints Office. Performance management framework To comply with its legislative obligations, CAHS operates under the WA health system Outcome Based Management Framework. This framework describes how outcomes, services and key performance indicators are used to measure agency performance towards achieving the relevant overarching whole-of-government goal. Key performance indicators measure the effectiveness and efficiency of services provided by the WA health CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE24 system in achieving the stated desired outcomes. All WA health system reporting entities contribute to achieving the outcomes through health services delivered either directly by the entities or indirectly through contracts with non-government organisations. The WA health system's outcomes and key performance indicators for 2017-18 are aligned to the State Government goal of \"Strong Communities: Safe communities and supported families\" (see Figure 1). The outcomes for achievement in 2017-18 by CAHS are: Outcome 1: Public hospital based services that enable effective treatment and restorative health care for Western Australians. Outcome 2: Prevention, health promotion and aged and continuing care services that help Western Australians to live healthy and safe lives. CAHS activities that are aligned to Outcome 1 and 2 are cited in Figure 2. Activities related to Outcome 1 aim to: 1. Provide quality diagnostic and treatment services that ensure the maximum restoration to health after an acute illness or injury 2. Provide appropriate after-care and rehabilitation to ensure that people's physical and social functioning is restored as far as possible 3. Provide appropriate care and support for patients and their families during terminal illness.Activities related to Outcome 2 aim to: 1. Increase the likelihood of optimal health and wellbeing by: providing programs that support optimal physical, social and emotional development of infants and children encouraging healthy lifestyles (e.g. diet and exercise). 2. Reduce the likelihood of onset of disease or injury by: immunisation programs safety programs. 3. Reduce the risk of long-term disability or premature death from injury or illness through prevention, early identification and intervention, such as: programs for early detection of developmental issues in children and appropriate referral for intervention early identification and intervention of disease and disabling conditions (e.g. screening of newborns) with appropriate referrals programs that support self-management by people with diagnosed conditions and disease (e.g. diabetic education) monitor the incidence of disease in the population to determine the effectiveness of primary health measures. 4. Provide continuing care services and programs that improve and enhance the wellbeing and environment for people with chronic illness or disability, enabling people with chronic illness or disability to maintain as much independence in their everyday life as their illness or disability permits, supporting people in their homes for as long as possible and providing extra care when long-term residential care is required. Services and programs are delivered to: ensure that people experience the minimum pain and discomfort from their chronic illness or disability maintain the optimal level of physical and social functioning prevent or slow down the progression of the illness or disability enable people to live as long as possible in the place of their choice supported by, for example, home care services support families and carers in their roles provide access to recreation and education. Performance against these activities and outcomes is summarised in the Agency Performance section, and described in detail under Key Performance Indicators in the Disclosures and Legal Compliance section commencing on page 158.25 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE25 Figure 1: Outcomes and key effectiveness indicators aligned to the State Government goal for CAHS WA STRATEGIC OUTCOME (WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT) Strong Communities: Safe communities and supported families CAHS VISION Healthy kids, healthy communities CAHS OBJECTIVES 1.

Performance Highlights 32 Princess Margaret Hospital / Perth Children's Hospital A MOVING EXPERIENCE About 650 people banded together on Sunday 10 June 2018 to safely transfer 91 children from Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH) to Perth Children's Hospital (PCH) in the State's biggest-ever paediatric medical move. The complex logistical operation involved staff from the Child and Adolescent Health Service (CAHS), St John Ambulance, Main Roads, WA Police, the Department of Health's Disaster Preparedness Management Unit and QEII Medical Centre As the sun rose over PMH for the last time as a working hospital, 12-year-old patient Darius set off at 7am in one of 15 ambulances involved in final move day. After a four kilometre journey to Nedlands, he was welcomed by Health Minister Roger Cook and officially became PCH's first inpatient. Over the next six hours, another 90 children followed Darius, and quickly settled into their new wards and enjoyed welcome packs provided by the PCH Foundation. The PCH Emergency Department (ED) also opened its doors at 7am, with the PMH ED simultaneously closing at this time. The ED team saw 185 patients during the department's first day and night of operation at PCH. Five emergency cases were seen in theatre and 21 patients were admitted, meaning more than 100 children stayed over at PCH on its first night.Supporting a shift in the complex care model Throughout 2017-18, PMH supported a shift in the complex care model; moving from an institutional model to a contemporary case management model, where the service is tailored to the needs of the individual child. The new model will provide care closer to home. In addition, it will provide cost efficiencies to the system by targeting support to meet individual needs in a non- hospital environment. The provision of a pathway-guided, efficient discharge process is likely to reduce length of hospital stay for children with high medical and complex care needs. In addition, cost savings will be generated by the early exploration of funding from external agencies to access other funding sources and services outside of CAHS.CAHS Chief Executive Dr Robyn Lawrence thanked staff for their dedication and significant contribution. \"The move to our new hospital and the immeasurable work leading to this point is something that we can all be extremely proud of,\" she said. On Monday June 11, after the move was complete, CAHS Board Chair, Debbie Karasinski, representatives from the Aboriginal Leadership Group and PCH Chaplain Robert Anderson said goodbye to PMH with a Noongar Smoking Ceremony. The group was led by Aboriginal Elder Nigel Wilkes and Alice Keating. They walked around the site and then into the hospital with the Elder leading the culturally appropriate spiritual cleansing of PMH through the Noongar Smoking Ceremony.33 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE33 Central Venous Access Devices Service A multidisciplinary group of clinicians collaborated to improve patient outcomes through: the introduction of a specialist team for device insertion and prevention of failure a centralised referral process to assess device selection and procedural management surveillance and bench marking with targeted quality improvement initiatives clinical leadership to support staff, patients and their families. In 2017-18, key achievements included improved completion of therapy rates, along with reductions in failed insertion rates, device removal due to blockage and central line associated blood stream infections in the oncology and haematology cohort.Safety Team Response Service (STARS) STARS is a dedicated team of onsite clinicians tasked with providing care to inpatients seven days a week in the out-of-hours period (4pm to 8am Monday to Friday, and all of Saturday and Sunday) in designated inpatient ward areas. STARS helps to strengthen the medical and nursing resources available after hours and provide a more coordinated and integrated response to clinical review and management of inpatients. The STARS team works collaboratively to manage and address patient care issues and clinical deterioration, and to provide support and guidance to staff after hours. The STARS team forms part of the medical emergency response, with the Clinical Nurse working collaboratively with the Hospital Clinical Nurse Manager to provide clinical support and expertise to improve the quality and safety of patient care and assist nursing staff managing patients of concern after hours. Volunteers Now well and truly settled into PCH, our volunteer community currently numbers approximately 400 people, with a roster that now includes additional evening and weekend shifts. Wearing their new striking tangerine uniforms, our volunteers come from all walks of life and are diverse in ages ranges from 18-87, with over 50 languages spoken. We are very pleased that we are continuing to reach a gender balance, with more male volunteers joining us than ever before. We are also particularly grateful to the volunteers who participated in over 1,000 training shifts, representing 3,000 hours of on the job training, which ensured a smooth transition from PMH to PCH. Some of the new roles for volunteers at PCH include Way Finding, Play Leisure and Engagement, and driving the new 'Stitches Shuttle' service from the hospital car parks for children in wheelchairs. Existing volunteer roles include working in the School for Special Education Needs, the Emergency Department, Outpatients, Medical Imaging, Theatre, Speech Pathology, Archives, Admissions, Animal Companions and Ward Friends. We would like to make special mention of our wonderful Ann Taylor, who enters her 30th year of volunteering for PMH and PCH. Ann personifies the volunteer dedication and commitment to patients and families, and was given the honour of being the first volunteer at PCH to meet and greet its first patients and families in May 2018. We would also like to acknowledge and congratulate Ann for being the recipient of the City of Melville's Citizen of the Year in 2018. We received some very good news when CAHS successfully completed an Organisation Wide Survey in February 2018. Amongst many other notable comments, one surveyor described the PMH and PCH volunteer service as the best hospital volunteer service she had seen. We would also like to express our deep gratitude to those volunteers who retired from their volunteering role this year and to warmly welcome all of those people who are now part of our volunteer community. CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE34 \" We received some very good news when CAHS successfully completed an Organisation Wide Survey in February 2018. Amongst many other notable comments, one surveyor described the PMH/PCH volunteer service as the best hospital volunteer service she had seen.\"35 School Health Community school health nurses work with school staff and parents to deliver prevention and health promotion services, develop health care plans for students with complex or chronic health needs, and connect children and adolescents with other health services and supports as required. In the 2017 school year, there were 108,459 occasions of service in primary schools and 74,373 occasions of service in high school settings. The School Entry Health Assessment (SEHA) completion rate has consistently exceeded the target rate of 90 per cent. In the 2017 school year, 94.3 per cent of Kindergarten children received a SEHA. In September 2017, work commenced on a review of community school aged health services. This review will help to ensure that school aged health services remain contemporary, are aligned to best practice, and continue to meet the needs of the community into the future.Child Development Service The Child Development Service (CDS) provides a range of free allied health and developmental paediatric services across metropolitan Perth for children with developmental delay. Arising from feedback provided from over 1,000 families, CDS completed a major service redesign during 2017-18. The reforms were aimed at engaging consumers earlier in the client journey, partnering with families to plan services for their child, and providing a range of flexible service delivery options in order to better meet the individual needs of clients. CDS received the 2017 WA Health Award in the Engaging with Consumers, Carers and the Community category for this reform work. Service redesign has ensured that parents are engaged early in the client journey, with more than 90 per cent of families receiving a service planning appointment within eight weeks of referral. Waiting time reductions have also been maintained for all major allied health disciplines. Median waiting times for CDS allied health services remained between one and six months during 2017-18, despite a significant increase in demand. In 2017, CDS provided services to 20,502 children across metropolitan Perth. Child Health A review of the Universal Child Health Service Delivery Model in 2015 made recommendations for improvements to community child health services across Western Australia aimed at better meeting the needs of families. Following intensive planning and preparation, the new child health service delivery model was successfully implemented across Western Australia on 1 July 2017. Key changes include: an updated universal child health contact schedule (0-14 days, 8 weeks, 4 months, 12 months, 2 years and school entry)Child and Adolescent Community Health GROWTH, DEVELOPMENT AND WELLBEING CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE36 greater flexibility for families to access community child health services through increased drop-in and group sessions improvements in the health check assessment protocols, including use of a more robust parent questionnaire for identification of developmental delays targeted individual and group sessions to support families with additional needs. In Perth, the new model has delivered greater flexibility and improved accessibility for families, with the number of contacts at drop-in sessions increasing by more than 50 per cent since implementation. Similarly, the number of parenting group sessions has increased by 8 per cent. Immunisation Child and Adolescent Community Health (CACH) delivers a 0-4 year old immunisation service from more than 50 clinics and community facilities across the Perth metropolitan area. Mapping GP and community health immunisation services was undertaken during 2017 to identify areas where CACH immunisation services could better meet the needs of the community. During 2017, CACH delivered 65,752 vaccinations through the 0-4 year old vaccination program. CACH also delivers a school-based program to high school students across the metropolitan area. The program delivers Gardasil (HPV), Varivax (Chicken Pox) and Adacel (Tetanus, Diptheria and Pertussis) vaccines to students in Year 8. From May 2017, CACH also started providing Meningococcal W vaccinations for students in years 10, 11 and 12 across the metropolitan area. During the 2017 school year, CACH provided immunisation services to students at 153 high schools, delivering a total of 110,734 vaccinations, including 37,894 meningococcal W the 0-4 and school-aged immunisation programs.\" Forty six schools have been booked for ear health screening since the start of the 2018 school year. This has significantly exceeded the 45 schools that were screened during the whole 2017 school year.\" 37 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE37 KPI's Financial Prev Next Aboriginal health in the community The Aboriginal Health Team (AHT) delivers the Enhanced Aboriginal Child Health Schedule (EACHS) to approximately 1,000 clients who have elected to receive a service from the AHT or have been referred by mainstream services. This involves Community Health Nurses working alongside Aboriginal Health Workers (AHW) to provide a comprehensive and culturally acceptable primary health care service designed specifically to address the needs of Aboriginal families. The program is delivered predominantly as a home visiting model. The EACHS differs significantly from the Universal Schedule Contact in the number of contacts offered. This is in recognition of the need for a comprehensive approach to supporting and strengthening the mother's or care-giver's parenting abilities and the developmental screening and surveillance of the child in order to maximise positive outcomes. AHT has a dedicated Ear Health Team offering the Targeted Ear Health School Screening Program to Aboriginal children in primary schools across the metropolitan area. Forty six schools have been booked for ear health screening since the start of the 2018 school year. This has significantly exceeded the 45 schools that were screened during the whole 2017 school year. Children requiring further assessment are seen by an Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) consultant and audiologist at the ENT clinics. Referrals are also accepted by General Practitioners (GPs), Paediatricians, Speech Pathologists, Audiologists and AHT Medical Officer. A major milestone in 2018 has been the reinstatement of the PCH outreach clinic for Aboriginal children in Padbury. Currently, clinics are offered in Armadale, Peel/ Rockingham/Kwinana area and Padbury. Clinics are well attended, with nearly 80 per cent of all children attending. AHT was also successful in securing Rural Health West funding for the Armadale clinic in 2017-18. AHT's medical and allied health team offer 100 clinics per year to children and their families who access the program. The Medical Officer also liaises regularly with the hospital, providing a link between tertiary hospital services and primary health services in the community for Aboriginal families. Allied health staff have been instrumental in training and supporting AHW in child development specifically in the use of the Ages and Stages Questionnaire - Talking about Raising Aboriginal Kids (ASQ-TRAK). The ASQ-TRAK monitors the developmental progress of children at intervals from 2-48 months of age, and is designed to provide culturally appropriate child development advice and feedback to parents. AHT's health promotion staff work in partnership with AHT clinicians, external agencies and the local community to deliver better health outcomes in response to community needs, national and local priorities. In 2017-18, the team completed the Our Kulunga and Low Iron survey, which examined the health literacy of parents and caregivers on low iron; a significant issue in the community. In addition, the team delivered the Kiya Wandjoo Wandjoo Nidja (Hello Welcome Here) Lockridge Art Project and Koorlanga Warlang Bidee (Children on a Healthy Path), as well as Aboriginal playgroups. CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE38 A ceremony to celebrate the State-Wide Mental Health Graduate Nursing Program was held on 9 February 2018. Graduate Olivia Strudwick, who was based at the Child and Adolescent Mental Health (CAMHS) Bentley Adolescent Unit, received the Graduate Nurse of the Year Award for her outstanding achievements during the graduate program. Olivia was awarded the title based on her leadership skills, ability to empower others, innovation and professional practice. CAMHS has received approval from the CAHS Human Research Ethics Committee to commence the first of several studies aimed at integrating mental and physical health. These studies will be undertaken by CAMHS in collaboration with the University of Western Australia. This first study aims to examine barriers and facilitators towards participation in physical activity, as well as perceptions of physical literacy in both children with mental health disorders and their parents and carers. It is intended that information attained from this study will be used to guide the development of a physical activity intervention designed to improve the physical literacy and physical activity levels of children with mental health disorders.Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service 39 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE39 Kulunga Moort Mia - 'children and family place' is a lounge area on the ground floor of PCH that provides a culturally sensitive and relaxing retreat for families accessing the hospital, away from busy clinical environments. Kulunga Moort Mia overlooks the northern green space and is close to Kings Park. In April 2018, more than 100 guests, including the Minister for Health, the Hon. Roger Cook, attended a smoking ceremony - a traditional blessing of the land and the hospital. The ceremony started with a traditional Welcome to Country performed by Elder Doolann-Leisha Eatts of the Whadjuk nation alongside her husband, Walter Eatts. Guests were then treated to a performance of traditional dances by the Mungart Yongah Aboriginal Dancers. To conclude the ceremony, Noongar elder Uncle Ben Taylor guided guests through cleansing smoke, produced by burning native plants. Uncle Ben had also performed PCH's very first smoking ceremony prior to commencement of the hospital's construction in 2012. A departing smoking ceremony was held at PMH, performed by Noongar Whadjuk Elder Nigel Wilkes, to cleanse the building and for safe passage to PCH. Within the hospital, the Aboriginal Liaison Service continues to provide support to patients and families within both hospital and community settings. Support can be in the form of cultural support, advocacy or practical support to those identified as most vulnerable. Beyond Perth Children's Hospital, the Child and Adolescent Health Service continues to deliver a range of multi-disciplinary, targeted programs and services aimed at engaging effectively with families to provide culturally safe and accessible care. In 2017-18, the mental health service Warlang Nyit Wirrin, Moorditj Koorlangakas - 'Healthy little spirits make good strong children and adolescents' held two community forums, in Midland and Kwinana, to promote the program to the community. The forums also provided an opportunity for CAHS to hear from community members about how access to mental health services can be improved for young people and their families. Koorliny Moort 'walking with families', continues to provide in and out-of-hospital care coordination to patients and their families and works in partnership with Aboriginal medical services to support families attending the outreach clinics. In 2018, an Aboriginal health promotions officer, funded by the PCH Foundation, was employed to assist in the outreach clinics to provide cultural guidance, health promotion and clinical work. Funding has also been secured for a further three years for the two Koorliny Moort Paediatric Registrars through the Royal Australasian College of Physicians Specialist Training Program. This means that longstanding partnerships with researchers, including from the University of Western Australia and the Telethon Kids Institute, will continue at PCH in translating health research into clinical practice.Aboriginal health at CAHS 'Wandju wandju, nidja'. Perth Children's Hospital has been designed as a welcoming place of healing, and the Noongar welcome is proudly displayed at all public entrances to the hospital. CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE40 Significant events continue to be celebrated across CAHS services. During NAIDOC Week, CAHS was a stall holder at a number of community events, including at Armadale and Midland, to raise visibility of programs and services. At PMH, an art display was held, as well as a morning tea and cultural quiz in the social work department. The Aboriginal Health Leadership Advisory Committee continues to meet on a monthly basis to provide cultural advice and direction in improving Aboriginal child and adolescent health. Cultural awareness is a significant part of the induction for new staff within CAHS. At the end of the 2017-18 financial year, 85 per cent of staff had completed the cultural e-learning program. In addition to this, the increase in Aboriginal staff across the health service has further assisted staff with engagement with Aboriginal clients, their families and communities. \" The Child and Adolescent Health Service delivers a range of multi- disciplinary, targeted programs and services aimed at engaging effectively with families to provide culturally safe and accessible care.\" 41 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE41 KPI's Financial Prev Next Research This financial year has been one of many highlights for research at CAHS. Child health research continues to be active and a key priority for the organisation, with significant generation of successful research grants, as well as scientific publications as a result of the research undertaken. Child health research at CAHS empowers both staff and partner organisations to undertake research of the highest quality, with the goal of translating research into improvements in overall health and healthcare for all children and young people in WA. Other achievements have included the development of the CAHS Child Health Research Strategy 2019-2022. CAHS was the only WA participant in a successful pilot program which involved having a dedicated support role to improve the efficiency of site assessment and authorisation of clinical trials. As a result of the pilot, the NHMRC has rolled this process out nationally, with funding to support a Clinical Trials Liaison Officer at each WA metropolitan health service. CAHS continues to provide research education opportunities for WA Health employees and affiliated research institutions through a fortnightly Research Education Seminar series, which occurs at Perth Children's Hospital but is delivered statewide via video broadcast technology. In 2017, over 2800 clinicians and researchers attended this hour-long introduction into good research practices which continues to be rated highly by those attending.KEY HIGHLIGHTS INCLUDE The CAHS Human Research Ethics Committee was successful in achieving NATIONAL HEALTH AND MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL (NHMRC) RE-ACCREDITATION IN JULY 2017.A TOTAL OF 61 247 were reviewed and approved by the CAHS Human Research Ethics Committee and Research Governance.NEW RESEARCH APPLICATIONS AMENDMENTS 400 SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH PUBLICATIONS arising from research on CAHS' locations or involving CAHS staff were published in peer reviewed journals.were successfully approved and have subsequently transitioned to Perth Children's Hospital300 ONGOING RESEARCH PROJECTS Researchers across CAHS, as well as UWA affiliated researchers and the Telethon Kids Institute, were awarded more than $24 MILLION through competitive grants to undertake research, for research fellowships and infrastructure to undertake child health research.& OVER MORE THAN42 Perth Children's Hospital PCH is the sole tertiary paediatric teaching hospital in Western Australia, and facilitates training for undergraduate medical students from the University of Western Australia as well as the University of Notre Dame.

Accreditation of JMO Terms is performed by the Postgraduate Medical Council of WA for pre-vocational trainees. In addition, PCH provides undergraduate student placements for nurses from Curtin, Notre Dame, Edith Cowan Universities and Murdoch Universities. Paediatric Nursing Education facilitates mandatory training and continuing education through courses and programs that support evidence-based practice, critical thinking and enhanced career pathways. Continuous education programs are inclusive of the mandatory training requirements set in the CAHS Policy mandatory framework. The Allied Health professions support clinical placements for undergraduate and post-graduate allied health professionals to gain experience in a paediatric environment. Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service Child and Adolescent Mental Health is responsible for the organisation and delivery of education and training to its clinical and non-clinical staff to enhance the delivery of quality, evidence-based child and adolescent community and inpatient mental health services. The education and training of staff is guided by a Core Competency Framework, which is also aligned to the National Practice Standards for the Mental Health Workforce.Child and Adolescent Community Health All staff working for CACH are required to complete training, in line with the CAHS Mandatory Training Framework and the CACH Practice Framework. A Clinical Education Team working in the Community Health nursing area provides on-site assistance to all nursing staff. CACH offers limited places for a six month rotation in the community. This opportunity allows graduates to develop their knowledge and skills using a family-centred approach within a variety of settings, including school health, Aboriginal health, refugee health, lactation consultancy, enuresis and immunisation. CACH also offers opportunities for second year Graduate Registered Nurses to undertake their graduate year in a community health setting.Teaching CAHS provides extensive Education and Training Programs for staff across the medical, nursing and allied health professions. 43 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE43 After the appointment of a Manager of Integrity and Ethics, CAHS developed and implemented an Integrity and Ethical Governance Framework during 2017-2018 linked to the Good Governance Principles outlined by the WA Public Sector Commission. The implementation of a reporting solution has enabled streamlined trending and reporting against the CAHS Integrity and Ethical Governance Framework. CAHS also reviewed policies and procedures relating to Public Interest Disclosure, Outside Employment, Acceptance of Gifts, and Managing Conflicts of Interests. A dedicated space on the CAHS intranet was also created to provide resources and information for employees on reporting issues of concern, legislative requirements for reporting criminal and professional mis-conduct, acceptance of gifts and travel as well as the Code of Conduct. Information was also published on the CAHS public website on conduct standards and integrity to enable consumers and the public to access information and report compliments, complaints, misconduct and Public Interest Disclosures. CAHS employee completion rate of Accountable and Ethical Decision Making (AEDM) training was 92 per cent compliant as at 30 June 2018. In 2017-18, a total of 55 reports or complaints alleging non-compliance with the Code of Conduct were lodged. Suspected breaches of discipline including matters of reportable misconduct were dealt with through the WA Health disciplinary processes and where appropriate reported to the Public Sector Commission (7) or the Corruption Crime Commission (24) as required under the Corruption, Crime and Misconduct Act 2003. Where breaches were substantiated, the decision maker determined the appropriate action in accordance with the Health Services Act 2016. The CAHS Ethical Conduct Review Committee meets monthly to provide governance oversight around misconduct risks, corrective actions and related systemic improvements. CAHS commenced implementing actions towards the recommendations associated with the Corruption and Crime Commission report on Serious Misconduct Risks Around Dangerous Drugs in Hospitals and also actions arising from the recommendations from the Public Sector Commission review into the management of confidential patient information at the Child and Adolescent Health Service.CAHS integrity and ethics CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE44 45 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE45 \" A dedicated space on the CAHS intranet was also created to provide resources and information for employees on reporting issues of concern, legislative requirements for reporting criminal and professional mis-conduct, acceptance of gifts and travel as well as the Code of Conduct.\" Statement from the Consumer Advisory Council Chair I am so pleased to be the Chair of the Consumer Advisory Council (CAC) for CAHS. We are a dedicated group of passionate people with lived experience, either as a parent, family member or previously as a patient, in the paediatric health service who are committed to promoting, developing and maintaining excellence in patient and family-centred care. CAC has been extremely active in bringing the consumer voice to all areas of the health service. As Chair, I have been welcomed into the CAHS Health Service Executive Committee (HSEC), which signals a vital partnership between the CAHS Executive and CAC. This past year has seen CAC being increasingly sought out to provide input and feedback, especially with the transition to Perth Children's Hospital (PCH). It has been an exciting year leading up to the long-awaited opening of PCH. We have seen an increase in CAHS staff awareness of connecting and involving families in their health care across community health, mental health and PMH and PCH. We are also very pleased to continue our relationship with a number of external organisations, including the Health Consumer's Council of WA. I would like to thank our CAC members for their ongoing dedication in bringing the consumer voice to all areas of CAHS and to all members of the HSEC and the Child and Family Engagement team for their ongoing commitment and support of CAC. MARGARET WOOD Chair Consumer Advisory Council CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE46 Statement from the Youth Advisory Committee Chair The Youth Advisory Committee (YAC) continues to be a unique and valuable asset for the Child and Adolescent Health Service (CAHS). Initially formed to assist in the design, development and building of Perth Children's Hospital (PCH), the CAHS YAC has grown into a much more diverse group with an increased strategic reach within WA Health with an awareness of wider State youth health demands. Over the last 12 months, YAC provided valuable input into a number of key policies and high-level documents, including the important development and implementation of the Department of Health's WA Youth Health Policy 2018-2023. YAC enthusiastically participated in the Australian Council on Healthcare Standards Organisation Wide Survey and has a seat at the CAHS Health Service Executive Committee table. YAC members sit on numerous other health service committees and working groups to provide their views and valuable insights into how best to create a patient and family-centred approach across CAHS. During the transition from PMH to PCH, YAC members remained passionately enthusiastic, and while the focus was on the shiny new hospital, YAC was careful not to lose focus on the existing CAHS services to ensure that PMH continued to be responsive to the needs of patients and their families. Ensuring that the 'little voices' are heard has always been the number one priority for YAC, which is why the YAC members took an active role in assisting with the planning and delivery of key outcomes from the across-CAHS Voice of the Family survey. At PCH, YAC participated extensively in user testing for the Patient Entertainment System and patient journey flow to ensure that patients and families had a good hospital experience from day one. Currently, YAC is involved in new areas of patient and family engagement, including exciting projects being developed by nursing research. While we have said goodbye to our beloved PMH, we look forward to a new chapter at PCH and what this means for improving the lives and health of Western Australian children and their families. DANIEL STAER Chair Youth Advisory Committee APRIL WELSH Former Chair Youth Advisory Committee 47 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE47 \" DAC has provided significant input into the development of the CAHS Disability Access and Inclusion Plan 2018-2022, which was finalised in early 2018.\"48 Statement from the Disability Advisory Committee Chair The Disability Advisory Committee (DAC) has a key role in ensuring children and families have improved access to existing services at CACH, CAMHS and PMH, as well as ensuring appropriate access and inclusion of people with disabilities as we transitioned to Perth Children's Hospital. The Disability Advisory Committee (DAC) has a key role in ensuring children and families have improved access to existing services at CACH, CAMHS and PMH, as well as ensuring appropriate access and inclusion of people with disabilities as we transitioned to Perth Children's Hospital. DAC has been actively involved in planning a range of key service areas to assist children and their families transition to Perth Children's Hospital. Their input into the facility's design, patient services and Patient Entertainment System has been important in ensuring that the new technology appropriately supports access for all children and youth with disabilities within our services. Access to disability parking and the introduction of a buggy service to provide assistance to parents with children and adolescents in wheelchairs, provides that extra support while navigating to and from the new hospital. DAC has provided significant input into the development of the CAHS Disability Access and Inclusion Plan (DAIP) 2018-2022, which was finalised in early 2018. The aim of the DAIP is to ensure people with disability, their carers, families and representatives can access the services provided by CAHS. The DAIP addresses seven key outcome areas to ensure people with disability: have the same opportunities as other people to access the services of, and any events organised by, a public authority have the same opportunity as other people to access the buildings and facilities of a public authority receive information from a public authority in a format that will enable them to access the information as readily as other people are able to access it receive the same level and quality of service from the staff of a public authority as other people receive from the staff of the public authority have the same opportunities as other people to make complaints to a public authority have the same opportunities as other people to participate in any public consultation by a public authority have the same opportunities as other people to obtain and maintain employment with a public authority. An implementation plan is in progress, and reporting on outcomes will occur annually. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all members of the committee for their valuable input and participation throughout the year. In particular, I would like to acknowledge the consumer representatives for their significant contributions to the committee as well as their generosity in sharing their personal experiences in order to improve the outcomes for all children with disabilities. The consumer perspective assists CAHS to ensure our planning decisions and service provision is inclusive for all children and their families.

Effectiveness indicators provide information that assess the extent to which outcomes have been achieved through the resourcing and delivery of services to the community. Efficiency indicators monitor the relationship between the service delivered and the resources used to produce the service. Key performance indicators also provide a means to communicate to the community how CAHS is performing. A summary of the CAHS key performance indicators and variation from the 2017-18 targets is given in Table 1. Note Table 1 should be read in conjunction with detailed information on each key performance indicator found in the Disclosures and Legal Compliance section of this report.Note (1) As specified in the annual estimates approved under section 40 of the Financial Management Act. (2) The $10.502 million cost-shift for the Neonates Ward from the North Metropolitan Health Service's King Edward Memorial Hospital was a main contributing factor for the increase in total cost of services and net cost of services. (3) The opening of the Perth Children's Hospital (PCH) was the main reason for the variation for total equity. Property, plant and equipment ($1,177.467 million) and intangible assets ($52.400 million) for PCH were transferred from the Health Ministerial Body to the Health Service when the hospital opened in May 2018. The annual estimates did not budget for the transfer of these PCH assets. (4) The net increase in cash held mainly consisted of unexpended funding from State Government, Mental Health Commission and external organisations.

When patients first enter ED, they are assessed on how urgently treatment should be provided. A patient is allocated a triage category between 1 (immediate) and 5 (less urgent) that indicates their treatment acuity. Treatment should commence within the recommended time of the triage category allocated (see Table 2). The purpose of this process is to ensure treatment is given in the appropriate time, with the aim of preventing adverse conditions arising from deterioration in the patient's condition. With increasing demand on emergency departments, it is important to monitor performance to help develop strategies to manage this demand and assess the effectiveness of service provision. Percentage of emergency department patients seen within recommended times This indicator measures how effective emergency departments are at the starting point of patient care. It captures the percentage of patients treated within the timeframes recommended by the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine. A higher percentage indicates better performance. CAHS strives to treat all emergency department patients within the recommended period, but places most emphasis on the sickest and most time critical patients assigned to Categories 1 and 2. In 2017-18, CAHS continued to exceed performance expectations for Category 1, 2 and 5 patients (see Table 3). Performance in Categories 3 and 4 have improved from the previous year despite 449 more patients in these categories being treated during 2017-18. Category 5 access sits well above target. They comprise low acuity cases that represent a small percentage of presentations that can either be treated by a wider multi-disciplinary team or be directed to other providers more directly through the triage process. Annual results are affected by factors such as high winter demand, the total number of cases and the timing of presentations. For instance, patients mostly arrive at the Emergency Department at intervals between 0 and 5 minutes for several hours in a row, particularly in the evening, which can make it difficult to achieve the targets consistently.TRIAGE CATEGORY DESCRIPTION RESPONSE TARGET 1 Immediately life-threateningImmediate (2 minutes)100% 2Imminently life-threatening OR important 3Potentially life-threatening OR situational urgency30 minutes 75% 4Potentially serious OR situational urgency OR significant complexity or severity60 minutes 70% 5 Less urgent 120 minutes 70%Table 2: Triage category, description and WA performance targetsImprovements towards emergency department access53 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE53 Clinical incidents Learning from clinical incidents CAHS wholeheartedly embraces a culture of learning and recognises that health care will never be risk free. Learning from clinical incidents is an integral component of the safety and quality culture across the service as we aim for zero harm. To this end, CAHS strives to drive behaviour that creates a culture in which excellence in clinical care flourishes and is maintained through commitment to collaboration, transparency, disclosure, courage, learning and compassion. Safety is fundamental to a positive patient, client and family experience. Staff across CAHS are expected to use the clinical incident management system to record clinical incidents and near misses in the inpatient, outpatient and community settings for children using our acute care, mental health and primary care services. Clinical incidents (including near misses) are divided into three groups based on the severity of the incident; these are called Severity Assessment Codes (SAC). A SAC 1 is the most serious and is thoroughly investigated by a panel of experts who can identify factors that may have led to the incident and make recommendations to prevent it from happening again. Monthly reports are provided to all levels of the organisation and the Board to identify trends or areas of concern that may warrant a system-wide approach to improvements. This assists monitoring and ensuring accountability for patient safety.Table 3: Percentage of Child and Adolescent Health Service emergency department patients seen within recommended times, by triage category, 2017-18 TRIAGE CATEGORY 2016-17 * Declassified incidents have been investigated and found not to have resulted from health care delivery.Table 4: SAC 1 incidents 2017-18 SAC1 INCIDENT NUMBER Total notified 22 Investigated 16 Ongoing investigation 5 Declassified* 1 Total confirmed 21 Confirmed with patient outcome of death 3 Confirmed with patient outcome of serious harm 10 Confirmed with patient outcome of moderate harm 7 Confirmed with patient outcome of minor harm 0 Confirmed with patient outcome of no harm 1 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE54 Spotlight on: 1. Healthcare Acquired Infections (HAI) During the 2017-18 year, HAI were the highest reported category of SAC 1 incidents at CAHS. To better understand this increase in HAI, a multi-disciplinary review is being undertaken of the investigations and recommendations over the last three years. This review will identify any weaknesses in the controls implemented, and develop a plan for further improvements to prevent HAIs. 2. Behaviour Behaviour related incidents were the cause of the second-highest number of SAC 1 incidents and the second-highest number of incidents overall. The majority of behaviour related incidents are associated with our mental health patients. As a result, the Progressive Risk Assessment has been developed to allow staff to track a patient's mental health in the same way they would track physical health and respond quickly to deterioration. Work has also been done with the physical environments to reduce opportunities for patients to harm themselves. 3. Medication Medication errors are the highest number of overall incidents and the third highest SAC 1 incidents at CAHS. Work is being done in this area to improve prescribing, dispensing and administration processes. At PCH, new technology has been introduced to assist with the dispensing and administration of medications. On the wards, automated Findings From this near miss event, the review team found the ED had only recently implemented the use of the Subcutaneous Insulin and Blood Glucose Monitoring Chart, and there was lack of education on the use of the chart in ED. Insulin is usually charted by the Endocrinology medical team and not ED medical team. Both the medication safety training course and mandatory training for all medical staff clearly states that when prescribing insulin, the word 'units' is to written in full and abbreviations such as 'u' or 'IU' should not be used. This is because IU has the potential to be interpreted as international units, which is not in keeping with prescribing practices. Learnings and outcomes 1. All insulin prescriptions in ED are made after consulting with a diabetes specialist, and ED nurses confirm the insulin dose in person with the doctor. 2. The insulin charts have been redesigned to make them easier to understand and use, and therefore reduce the possibility of error. 3. Diabetes education is available to doctors and nurses in the hospital, as diabetes is a common condition and its management should not be considered specialist knowledge.dispensing machines use a system of lights to show staff which medication they need to administer to a particular patient. In the Pharmacy, robots deliver the correct medication. Both of these reduce the chance of a person picking up and giving the incorrect medication to a patient. All staff involved in prescribing, dispensing or administering medications have been trained to use this technology, as well as receiving training in medication safety and how to help prevent medication errors. Clinical incident case study Background A young child with Type 1 diabetes presented to the Princess Margaret Hospital Emergency Department (ED) with abdominal cramping, vomiting, decreased input and output and dizziness, and was admitted to hospital. The ED medical officer recorded that, prior to admission, the mother had given the child 4IU of Lantus and 2 to 3IU of Novorapid insulin when required. Incident Following admission to the ward, the treating nurse noted the Lantus was recorded as 4IU, which could be mistaken for 41 units. The child's mother confirmed she gave 4 units only, and the child did not receive an incorrect dose of medication. Lantus was also prescribed in the paediatric national inpatient medication chart as 4IU and 'insulin' 2-3IU when required.55 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE55 Significant Issues56 Perth Children's Hospital opening In April 2018, the opening dates of Perth Children's Hospital (PCH) were confirmed by the Premier and Minister for Health. The staged opening of PCH ran over four weeks, with the first outpatient clinics held on 14 May 2018. A fortnight later, on 28 May 2018, elective surgery started at PCH. The final move day for inpatients and the closure of Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH) occurred successfully on 10 June 2018. Patients from the Bentley Adolescent Unit moved on 13 June 2018. The confirmation of PCH's opening schedule followed confirmation that the hospital's potable water was safe to drink, after meeting Australian Drinking Water Guidelines and being signed off by the Chief Health Officer. The transfer of patients on 10 June ran smoothly and was the largest medical move of children in the State's history, with 91 patients transferred from PMH. About 650 people took part on final move day, including teams at both hospitals and staff from the PCH Project, St John Ambulance, Main Roads, WA Police, the Department of Health's Disaster Preparedness Management Unit, the Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre Trust and local councils located along the transfer route. Ageing community infrastructure A number of community facilities used by Child and Adolescent Community Health (CACH) and the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) are poorly located in relation to the population they serve. Some are not fit for purpose or do not comply with the latest building standards pertaining WorkSafe standards for mental health, and improvements are required for disability access, external access points, air conditioning systems and security. Whilst these issues exist Community Health has undertaken the necessary risk mitigations and remains compliant with necessary legislation. CACH continues to face a constant threat of insecure tenure, with mounting pressure to vacate a number of government facilities that have been previously provided free of charge. In the last six years, CACH has been evicted from eight sites and has to vacate at least another two sites in 2018-19. In addition, agencies that previously provided low or no cost tenancy arrangements are increasingly moving to charging commercial rates, which represents a further funding challenge for CACH and impacts the sustainability of the service. CAHS is exploring options for future service delivery. Demand and activity Overall CAHS has delivered services slightly above the activity targets set for 2017-18. The variance is due to an increase in the number of outpatient appointments and mental health inpatient services. The population of 0-19 year olds in metropolitan Perth increased by an estimated 84,543 between 2006 and 2016, which equates to an average 2.1 per cent increase each year. The greatest increase was in the 0-4 year old population, which increased by 33,738 (3.6 per cent each year) over this period. CACH has not received population growth funding since 2014-15, when CACH received 2.85 per cent population growth funding.57 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE57 Workforce challenges CAHS continued to re-align the Health Service Delivery units (Community, Mental Health and hospital based services) into a more integrated structure. The preparation for the transition of hospital-based services at the PMH Subiaco site and Mental Health unit at Bentley to the new Perth Children's Hospital at the Nedlands site provided challenges, with a significant number of employees having to be released from their normal duties for training in the new environment, layout and technology, as well as for hospital commissioning purposes. CAHS consulted widely with staff in developing a new Vision, Objectives and Values, which formed part of the framework for a new Strategic Plan to provide CAHS with a clear direction and purpose for 2018-23. The new 2017-18 workforce model for Junior Medical Officers (JMO), with provision for JMO leave and professional development, was successfully implemented despite challenges. Following concerns regarding staff morale among clinicians at Princess Margaret Hospital in early 2017, the CAHS Board commissioned a review, and the subsequent report was published in June 2017. The report contained 26 recommendations, all but three of which have been successfully implemented. Outstanding work was done during the year to improve the working environment at CAHS, although it is acknowledged that changing organisational culture requires more than a 12 month program to be adequately addressed. Of considerable assistance in this process was the Shape Our Future Steering Team, comprised of staff members. This team continues to provide advice and input on matters related to staff engagement and morale. Managing funds and costs efficiently Overall, CAHS contained costs over the last financial year with only a 4.3 per cent increase in total expenditure. In addition, own source revenue increased by 5.0 per cent and the cost of service increased by 3.9 per cent, resulting in a surplus position at year end. The CAHS Finance Oversight Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive and with membership including the Executive group, continues to apply the principles of activity based funding, funding reform and best practice financial management. This is being shared with managers across CAHS to support departmental accountability and responsibility. Directorate specific budget strategies involving both revenues and expenditures have been identified to assist achieve targets, which will be built on in future years. A new Financial Framework is being developed and implemented to enhance accountability, reporting and the understanding of interrelations between the various components of financial performance. Health inequalities The disparity in health outcomes of Aboriginal children compared to the remainder of the Australian population continues to be significant. Services to Aboriginal children and adolescents are delivered through primary, secondary and tertiary health care facilities across CAHS. Within CACH, dedicated community health services are provided to Aboriginal children and adolescents through the Aboriginal Health Team, who deliver culturally safe and appropriate services. Koorliny Moort (Walking with Families), an Aboriginal care coordination program to bridge the gap in providing services for children who need hospitalisation and out- of-hospital services, continues to be delivered by PCH. Specialist Aboriginal mental health services are provided through Community, Specialised and PCH CAMHS across the metropolitan area CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE58 to increase accessibility to services and deliver culturally appropriate and culturally safe services to Aboriginal children and their families. Further information pertaining to Aboriginal Health initiatives can be found on pages 38 and 40. Each year, the Child Development Service (CDS) provides services to approximately 20,000 children who have developmental difficulties, including intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder and other developmental disorders. Children with autism and intellectual disabilities have a higher incidence of mental health difficulties compared with the general population (36 per cent compared with 8 per cent). CAMHS is a key participant in the Young People with Exceptionally Complex Needs initiative, which includes children with complex mental health needs and intellectual disability and autism. A senior CAMHS clinician also founded and chairs an Intellectual Developmental Disabilities and Mental Illness special interest group. Disability services reform across WA continues to be driven by the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), with collaboration with CAHS, the Disability Services Commission, other government agencies and non- government organisations. In recognition of ongoing inequalities that exist in healthcare, CAHS seized the opportunity to embrace equity as a key organisational value as part of this year's strategic planning. As noted in the 2018-2023 CAHS Strategic Plan, by treating people in a fair and just manner, everyone receives the same rights and opportunities. In other words, CAHS' vision for being the best we can be includes a fair go for all.Restructure Extensive work has been undertaken in the last financial year to review and update the structure of the health service and create a new strategic plan. The primary objective of reviewing the health service structure was to ensure that all the functions required to effectively lead and manage a health service were aligned within the appropriate Executive roles and reporting structures while minimising duplication. As part of this, the structures of other health service providers and other health services across Australia were reviewed to inform planning for the CAHS structure. More than 100 staff submitted feedback on the structure. This feedback drove changes such as renaming directorates and functions, as well as broader themes around the representation of community health and mental health. CAHS is unique in being a small health service that delivers programs across a number of sites. However, being a small service means the executive structure must reflect the size and budget of CAHS. The new structure aligns the previous PCH, CACH and CAMHS executive structures into a single service supported by directorates: Community Health, Mental Health, Surgical, Medical, and Allied Health. Further to this, the CAHS Strategic Plan 2018- 2023 was developed and released as a result of extensive consultation and collaboration. The new plan features updated strategic priorities and a refreshed Vision: healthy kids, healthy communities, and Values: compassion, collaboration, accountability, respect, equity, and excellence. This work was undertaken as a recommendation of the PMH Review at a time of already significant change for the health service, as CAHS worked towards the opening of Perth Children's Hospital. The success of these concurrent challenges is further testament to the strength and resilience of the CAHS workforce. Accreditation CAHS underwent an organisation wide accreditation survey by the Australian Council on Healthcare Standards from 19-23 February 2018. Over these five days, the surveyors visited 12 community sites and 34 hospital department and wards. There were over 30 meetings held and more than 200 staff participated in those meetings. The four recommendations from the previous survey in 2014 were closed. This year, CAHS achieved seven 'Met with Merits' for the National Safety and Quality Health Service (NSQHS) standards: Governance, Partnering with 59 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE59 KPI's Financial Prev Next Consumers, Preventing and Controlling Hospital Acquired Infections, Medication Safety, Patient Identification and Procedure Matching, and Blood and Blood Products. CAHS also met all the actions of the 10 Mental Health Standards. CAHS received three 'Not Mets'; these were for developmental actions that CAHS self-rated as 'Not Met' in the Pre-Survey Assessment Report. The 'Not Met' actions relate to ensuring that a system is in place for preparing and/or receiving advance care plans in partnership with patients, families and carers, and will be re-assessed during the next survey. Overall, the feedback from the surveyors was overwhelmingly positive. The surveyors were particularly impressed by the 'many staff who expressed the positiveness (sic), passion and pride of working within this organisation'. In light of ongoing organisational changes, it was noted that 'the organisation has done well to establish a robust and well-functioning governance system for quality and safety, and the team was impressed with the values of the organisation, which were reflected within all conversations with staff'. National Disability Insurance Scheme In addition to the broader need to clarify referral pathways and eligibility for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, two aspects of the NDIS have particular relevance for CACH. These are the proposed introduction of the Early Childhood Early Intervention (ECEI) model, and the potential implications of the introduction of the NDIS on demand for autism assessments provided by the CDS.The ECEI model involves NDIS-funded non- government partners who provide developmental support, service planning and brief intervention for children 0-6 years of age prior to referral to NDIS (if required). There is a risk that this may replicate a small portion of the work carried out by CACH. This would be likely to result in confusion for consumers, fragmentation of the current model of care, and additional administrative burden across the system. CAHS is working with the National Disability Insurance Agency to mitigate this risk by collaboratively developing service pathways. The second risk specific to CACH relates to the provision of publicly-funded autism assessments. In Perth, these are currently provided by the CDS (approximately 240 assessments per annum) and the Department of Community - Disability Services (approximately 400 per annum). It is unclear under the Bilateral Agreement between the Commonwealth and Western Australia for the transition to a National Disability Insurance Scheme in Western Australia whether responsibility for autism assessments is held by health or the disability sector.

Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2018 1. Basis of preparation The Child and Adolescent Health Service (The Health Service) is a statutory aut hority established under the Health Services Act 2016 , governed by the Board. The Health Service is controlled by the St ate of Western Australia, which is the ultimate parent. The entity is a not-for-profi t entity (as profit is not its principal objective). These annual financial statements were authorised for issue by t he Accountable Authority of the Health Service on 17 September 2018. Statement of compliance These general purpose financial statements have been prepared in accordance with: 1) The Financial Management Act 2006 (FMA) 2) The Treasurer's Instructions (the Instructions or TI) 3) Australian Accounting Standards (AAS) including applicable interpretations 4) Where appropriate, those AAS par agraphs applicable for not for pr ofit entities have been applied. TheFinancial Management Act 2006 and the Treasurer's Instructions (the Instructions) take precedence over AAS. Several AAS are modified by the Instructions to vary application, disclosure, format and wording. Where modification is required and has had a material or significant financial effect upon the reported results, details of that modification and the resulting financial effe ct are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. Basis of preparation These financial statements are presented in Australian dollars applying the accrual ba sis of accounting and using the historica l cost convention. Certain balances will apply a different measurement basis (suc h as the fair value basis). Where this is the case, th e different measurement basi s is disclosed in the associated note. All values are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars ($000). Notwithstanding the Health Service's deficiency of working capita l (total current assets being less than total current liabilities), the financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. This basis has been adopted bec ause, with continuing funding from the State Government, th e Health Service is able to pay its liabilities as and when they fall due. The Health Ministerial Body, established under section 10 of the Health Services Act 2016 , had control of the Perth Children's Hospital (PCH) project during the 2016-17 and 2017-18 financial years. Hence, assets, liabilities, income and expenses for the PCH project were recognised in th e Department of Health's financial statements. Property, plant and equipment and Intangible assets for the Perth Children' s Hospital were transferred from the He alth Ministerial Body to the Health Service, when the hospital opened in May 2018. See Note 5.1 'P roperty, plant and equipment' and Note 5.2 'Intangible assets'. 73 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE73 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2018 Judgements and estimates Judgements, estimates and assumptions are required to be made about financial information being presented. The significant judg ements and estimates made in the preparation of these financial statement s are disclosed in the notes where amount s affected by those judgements and/or esti mates are disclosed. Estimates and associated assumptions are based on profes sional judgements derived from historical experience and various other factors th at are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Contributed equity AASB Interpretation 1038 Contributions by Owners Made to Wholly-Owned Public Sector Enti ties requires transfers in the nature o f equity contributions, other than as a result of a restructure of admin istrative arrangements, to be designated by t he Government (the owner) as contributio ns by owners (at the time of, or prior, to transfer) before such transfers can be recognised as equity contributions. Capital appropriations have been designate d as contributions by owners by TI 955 Contributions by Owners made to Wholly Owned Public Sector Entities and have been credited directly to Contributed Equity. The transfers of net assets to/from other agencies, other than as a result of a rest ructure of administrative arrangements, are designated as contributions by owners where the transfers are non-discretionary and non-reciprocal.

Employee on costs expenses (workers' compensation insurance) are included at Note 3.6 'Other expenses'. Termination benefits: Payable when employment is terminated before normal retirement date, or when an employee accepts an offer of benefits in excha nge for the termination of employment. Termination benefits are recognised when the Health Se rvice is demonstrably committed to termina ting the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal or providing term ination benefits as a result o f an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of the reporting per iod are discounted to present value. Superannuation benefits: The amounts recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Inco me comprise employer contributions paid to the Gold State Superannuation Scheme (GSS), the West Stat e Superannuation Scheme (WSS), the GESB Super Scheme (GESBS), or other superannuation funds. GSS (concurrent contributions) is a defined benefit scheme for t he purposes of employees and whole-of-government reporting. It is however a defined contribution plan for the Health Service's pu rposes because the concurr ent contributions (defined c ontributions) made by the He alth Service to the Government Employees Superannuation Board (GESB) extingui shes the Health Service's obligations to the related superannuation liability. The Health Service does not recognise any defined benefit liabilities because it has no legal or constructive obligation to pay future benefits relating to its employees. The liabilities for the unfund ed Pension Scheme and the unfunded GSS transfer benefits attributable to members who t ransferred from the Pension Scheme, are assumed by the Treasurer. All other GSS obligations are funded by concurrent contributions made by the Health Servi ce to the GESB. The GESB and other fund providers administer public sector superannuatio n arrangements in Western Australia in accordance with legislative requirements. Eligibility criteria for membership in particular schemes for pu blic sector employees vary according to commencement and implem entation dates. 81 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE81 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2018 3.1(b) Employee benefits provision Provision is made for benefits accruing to employees in respect of wages and sala ries, annual leave and long service leave for services rendered up to the reporting date and recorded as an expense dur ing the period the services are delivered. 2018 2017 $000 $000 Current Employee benefits provision Annual leave (a) 42,174 40,754 Time off in lieu leave (a) 9,868 7,333 Long service leave (b) 31,762 (c) 1,025 1,020 84,829 79,595 20,372 20,988 20,372 105,817 99,967 (a) Annual leave and time off in lieu leave liabilities: Classified as current as there is no unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2018 3.1(b) Employee benefits provision (cont.) (b) Long service leave liabilities: Unconditional long service leave provis ions are classified as current liabilities as the Health Service does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period. Pre-conditional and conditional long service leave provisions ar e classified as non-current liabilities because the Health Serv ice has an unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability until the empl oyee has completed the requ isite years of service. Assessments indicate that actual settlement of the liabilities is expected to occur as follows: 2018 2017 $000 $000 Within 12 months of the end of the reporting period 7,990 6,137 More than 12 months after the end of the reporting period 44,760 44,723 52,750 50,860 The provision of the long service leave liab ilities are calculated at present value as the Health Service does not expect to wh olly settle the amounts within 12 months. The present value is measured taki ng into account the present value of expect ed future payments to be made in relati on to services provided by employees up to the reporting date. These payments are estimated us ing the remuneration rate expected to apply at the time of s ettlement, discounted using market yields at the end of the reporti ng period on national government bonds with terms to maturity that match, as close ly as possible, the estimated future cash outflows. (c) Deferred salary scheme liabilities: Classified as current where there is no unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period. Assessm ents indicate that actual settlement of the liabilities is expected to occur as follows: 2018 2017 $000 $000 Within 12 months of the end of the reporting period 129 34 More than 12 months after the end of the reporting period 896 986 1,025 1,02083 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE83 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2018 3.1(b) Employee benefits provision (cont.) Key sources of estimation uncertainty - long service leave Key estimates and assumptions concerning the future are based on historical experience and variou s other factors that have a si gnificant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. Several estimates and assumptions are used in calculating the Health Service's long service leave provision. These include: Expected future salary rates Discount rates Employee retention rates; and Expected future payments Changes in these estimations and assumptions may impact on the carrying amount of the long service leave provision. In estimating the non-current long service leave liabilities, employees are assumed to leave the Health Service each year on ac count of resignation or retirement at 7.5%. This assumption was based on an analysis of the histor ical turnover rates exhibited by employees in the WA health services. Employees with leave benefits to which they are fully entitled are assumed to take all available leave unifor mly over the following five years or to age 65 if earlier. Any gain or loss following revaluation of the present value of long service leave liabilities is recognised as employee benefits expense.

(a) The Health Service has the right to operate and control the building for the Perth Children's Hospital (PCH) under the Memorandum of Understanding No.2 for Management and Control of Land and Buildings between the Health Ministerial Body and the Health Service. (b) Revaluation increment is credited directly to the asset reval uation reserve, except to the ex tent that any increment revers es a revaluation decrement of the same class of assets previously recognised as an expense. Revaluation decrement is re cognised as an expense, except to the extent of any balance existing in the asset \\revaluation reserve in respect of that classes of assets. Initial recognition Items of property, plant and equipment, costing $5,000 or more ar e measured initially at cost. Where an asset is acquired for n o or nominal cost, the cost is valued at its fair value at the date of acquisiti on. Items of property, plant and equipment costing less than $5,000 are immediately e xpensed direct to the Statement of Comprehensive Income (other than where they form part of a group of similar items which are significant in total). The cost of a leasehold improvement is capita lised and depreciated over the shorter of the remaining term of the lease or the e stimated useful life of the leasehold improvement. Subsequent measurement Subsequent to initial recognition of an asset, the revaluati on model is used for the measurement of land and buildings. Land is carried at fair value. Buildings are carried at fair va lue less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. All other property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumula ted depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. When buildings are revalued, the accumulated depreciation is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount restated to the revalued amount. Land and buildings are independently valued annually by the West ern Australian Land Information Authority (Valuations and Property Analytics) and recognised annually to ensure that the carrying amount does not differ materi ally from the asset's fair value at the end of the reporting period. Land and buildings were revalued as at 1 July 2017 by the West ern Australian Land Information Authority (Valuations and Propert y Analytics). The valuations were performed during the year ended 30 June 2018 and recognised at 30 June 2018. In undertaking the revaluation, fair value wa s determined by reference to market values for land: $0.657 million (2017: $19.589 million) and $0.121 million). For the re maining balance, fair value of buildings was determined on the basis of current replacement cost and fair value of land was determined on the basis of compari son with market evidence for land with low level utility (high restricted use land). 97 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE97 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2018 5.1 Property, plant and equipment (cont.) Revaluation model: (a) Fair Value where market-based evidence is available: The fair value of land and buildings is determined on the basis of current market values determined by reference to recent mark et transactions. (b) Fair value in the absence of market-based evidence: Fair value of land and buildings is determined on the basis of ex isting use where buildings are specialised or where land is re stricted. Existing use buildings: Fair value is determined by reference to the cost of replacing the remaining future economic benefits e mbodied in the asset, i.e. the current replacement cost. Restricted use land: Fair value is determined by comparison wi th market evidence for land with similar approximate utility (high restricted use land) or market value of comparable unrestricted land (low restricted use land). Significant assumptions and judgements The most significant assumptions and judgements in estimating fa ir value are made in assessing whether to apply the existing us e basis to assets and in determining estimated economic life. Professi onal judgement by the valuer is required wh ere the evidence does not provide a cle ar distinction between market type assets and existing use assets. There are a number of buildings that loca ted on the land of local government agencies have been recognised in the financial sta tements. The Health Service believes that, based on past experience, its occupancy in thes e buildings will continue to the end of their useful lives.

Finite useful lives All property, plant and equipment having a limited useful life are syst ematically depreciated over their estimated useful lives in a manner that reflects the consumption of their future economic benefits. The except ions to this rule include assets held for sale and land. Depreciation is generally calculated on a straight line basis, at ra tes that allocate the asset's value, less any estimated res idual value, over its estimated useful life. Typical estimated useful lives for the different asset clas ses for current and prior years are included in the table below: Buildings 50 years Site infrastructure 50 years Leasehold improvements Term of the lease Computer equipment 2 to 10 years Furniture and fittings 3 to 20 years Motor vehicles 10 years Medical equipment 2 to 20 years Other plant and equipment 2 to 30 years 99 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE99 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2018 5.1.1 Depreciation and impairment (cont.) Land and artworks, which are considered to have an indefinite useful life, are not depreciated. Their service potential has not , in any material sense, been consumed during the reporting period and consequently depreciation is not recognised. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation me thod are reviewed at the end of each annual reporting period, an d adjustments should be made where appropriate. Impairment Non-financial assets, including items of plant and equipment, are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. Where there is an indication of impairment, the recoverable amount is es timated. Where the recoverable am ount is less than the carryi ng amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to the recoverabl e amount and an impairment loss is recognised. Where an asset measured at cost is written down to its recove rable amount, an impairment loss is recognised through profit or l oss. Where a previously revalued asset is written down to its reco verable amount, the loss is recogni sed as a revaluation decrement through other comprehensive income. As the Health Service is a not-for-profit entity, the recoverable amount of regularly revalued specialised assets is anticipate d to be materially the same as fair value. If there is an indication that there has been a reversal in impa irment, the carrying amount shall be increased to its recoverable amount. However this reversal should not increase the asset's carrying amount above what wo uld have been determined, net of depr eciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised in prior years. The risk of impairment is generally limited to circumstances where an asset's depreciat ion is materially understated, where the replacement cost is falling or where there is a significant change in useful life. Each relevant class of assets is reviewed annually to verify that the accumulated depreciation/amortisation reflects the level of consumption or expiration of the asset's future econ omic benefits and to evaluate any impairment risk from declining r eplacement costs.

Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2018 5.1.2 Loss on disposal of non-current assets The Health Service incurred the following losses on disposal of non-current assets: 2018 2017 $000 $000 Carrying amount of non-current assets disposed: Property, plant and equipment 82 6 Proceeds from disposal of non-current assets: Property, plant and equipment - (4) Net loss on disposal of non-current assets 82 2 Realised and unrealised gains are usually recognised on a net basis. These include gains aris ing on the disposal of non-current assets and some revaluation s of non-current assets. Gains and losses on the disposal of non-current assets are presen ted by deducting from the proceeds on disposal the carrying am ount of the asset and related selling expenses. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or lo ss in the Statement of Comprehensive Income (from the proceeds of sale). 101 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE101 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2018 5.2 Intangible assets Computer softwareSoftware under development Total $000 $000 $000 Transfer from the Government at 1 July 2016 4 - 4 Additions - 6 6 Write-down of assets (a) (4) - (4) Carrying amount at 30 June 2017 - 6 6 Write-down of assets - (6) (6) Transfer from Health Ministerial Body 52,400 - 52,400 Amortisation expense (656) - (656) Carrying amount at 30 June 2018 51,744 - 51,744 Gross carrying amount 52,400 - 52,400 Accumulated amortisation (656) - (656) (a) The intangible asset transferred from the Government was expe nsed in the previous financial y ear, as it was below the asset capitalisation threshold.

Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2018 5.2 Intangible assets (cont.) An internally generated intangible asset arising from development (or from the development phase of an internal project) is recognised if, and only if, all of the following are demonstrated: (a) The technical feasibility of completing the int angible asset so that it will be available for use; (b) An intention to complete the intangible asset and use it; (c) The ability to use the intangible asset; (d) The intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefit; (e) The availability of adequate technical, financial and other reso urces to complete the development and to use the intangible asset; (f) The ability to measure reliably the expenditure attr ibutable to the intangible asset during its development. Costs incurred in the research phase of a project are immediately expensed. Software that is an integral part of the related hardware is recognised as property, plant and equipment. Software that is not an integral part of the related hardware is recognised as an intangible asset. Subsequent measurement The cost model is applied for subsequent m easurement of intangible assets, requiring t he assets to be carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. 103 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE103 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2018 5.2.1 Amortisation and impairment Charges for the period 2018 2017 Amortisation $000 $000 Computer software 656 - Total amortisation for the period 656 - The Health Service held no goodwill or intangible assets with an indefinite useful life during t he reporting period.

The accrued salaries suspense account (See Note 7.3.1 'Restrict ed cash and cash equivalents') consists of amounts paid annually into a Treasury suspense account to meet the additional cash outflow for employee salary payments in the reporting periods with 27 pay days instead of t he normal 26. No interest is received on this account. 6.6 Other liabilities 2018 2017 $000 $000 Current Income received in advance - 150 Paid parental leave scheme 23 62 23 212109 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE109 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2018 7.

Risks and Contingencies This note sets out the key risk management policies and measurement techniques of the Health Service. Notes Financial risk management 8.1 Contingent assets 8.2.1 Contingent liabilities 8.2.2 Fair value measurements 8.3 117 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE117 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2018 8.1 Financial risk management Financial instruments held by the Health Service are cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, borrowing s, receivables and payables. The Health Service has limited exposure to financi al risks. The Health Service's overall risk management program focuses on managin g the risks identified below. (a) Summary of risks and risk management Credit risk Credit risk arises when there is the possibility of the Health Service's rece ivables defaulting on their contractual obligation s resulting in financial loss to the Health Service. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of the reporti ng period in relation to each class of recognised financial assets is the gross carrying amount of those assets inclusive of any allowance for impairment as shown in the table at Note 8.1(c) 'Ageing analysis of financial asset s' and Note 6.1 'Receivables'. Credit risk associated with the Health Service's financial asse ts is generally confined to patient fee debtors (see Note 6.1). The main receivable of the Health Service is the amounts receivable for services (holding account). For receivables other than government agencies and patient f ee debtors, the Health Service trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. The Health Service has policies in place to ensure that sales of produ cts and services are made to customers with an appropriate credit history. In addition, re ceivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the resul t that the Health Service's exposure to bad debts is minimised. At the end of the reporting period, there were no significant conc entrations of credit risk. All debts are individually reviewed, on a timely basis at 30, 60, 90 and 120 days. In a circumstance where a third party is responsible for payment, or there are legal considerations, payment of accounts can be delayed cons iderably. Unpaid debts are referred to an external debt collectio n service within six months of the accounts being raised. Allowance for impairment of financial assets is calculated based on objective evidence such as observable data indicating chang es in client credit ratings. For financial assets that are either past due or impaired, refe r to Note 8.1(c) 'Ageing analysis of financial assets'. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk arises when the Health Serv ice is unable to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Health Service is exposed to liquidity risk through its normal course of operations. The Health Service has appropriate procedures to manage cash fl ows including drawdowns of approp riations by monitoring forecast cash flows to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet its commitments. Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in ma rket prices such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect the Health Service's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The Health Service does not trade in foreign currency and is not materially exposed to other price risks. The Health Service's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the long-term debt ob ligations. The Health Service' s borrowings consist of the Department of Treasury (DT) loans. The in terest rate risk for the loans is managed by DT through portfolio diversification.

Contingent assets an d liabilities are presented inclusive of GST receivable or payable respectively. 8.2.1 Contingent assets At the reporting date, the Health Service is not aware of any contingent assets. 8.2.2 Contingent liabilities Except for the time off in lieu entitlements for employees, the H ealth Service is not aware of any contingent liabilities at th e reporting date. Litigation in progress The Health Service does not have any pending litigation that are not recoverable from RiskCover insurance at the reporting date . Contaminated sites Under the Contaminated Sites Act 2003 , the Health Service is required to report known and suspec ted contaminated sites to the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation (DWER). In accordance with the Act, DW ER classifies these sites on the basis of the risk to human heal th, the environment and environmental values. Where sites are classified as contaminated - remediation required or possibly contaminated - in vestigation required, the Health Service may have a liability in respect of investigation or remediation expenses. At the reporting date, the Health Service does not have any suspected contaminated sites reported under the Act. Time off in lieu entitlements for employees As a result of the inconsistent interpretation of industrial aw ards and configuration of payroll system, the public holiday tim e off in lieu entitlements and payments have been incorrectly calculated for the Health Service's employee s over a number of years. A solution has recently been imple mented in the payroll system for the nursing employees and a total liability amounting to $1.860 m illion and the related expense have been recognised in the fin ancial statements. With respect to other groups of employees that are also entitled to t he public holiday time off in lieu leave, the liabilities and expenses have not been recognised in the financial statements, because the amounts cannot be reliably estimated at the reporting date.

Time off in lieu entitlements for employees As a result of the inconsistent interpretation of industrial aw ards and configuration of payroll system, the public holiday tim e off in lieu entitlements and payments have been incorrectly calculated for the Health Service's employee s over a number of years. A solution has recently been imple mented in the payroll system for the nursing employees and a total liability amounting to $1.860 m illion and the related expense have been recognised in the fin ancial statements. With respect to other groups of employees that are also entitled to t he public holiday time off in lieu leave, the liabilities and expenses have not been recognised in the financial statements, because the amounts cannot be reliably estimated at the reporting date. Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2018 8.3 Fair value measurements AASB 13 requires disclosure of fa ir value measurement by level of the follo wing fair value meas urement hierarchy: a) quoted prices (unadjusted) in active ma rkets for identical assets (level 1); b) input other than quoted prices included within level 1 that ar e observable for the asset either directly or indirectly (leve l 2); and c) inputs for the asset that are not based on obs ervable market data (unobse rvable input) (level 3). The following table represents the Health Service's assets measured at fair value: Fair value at end of Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 period 2018 Notes $000 $000 $000 $000 Land 5.1 Car parks - - - - Residential - 657 - 657 Specialised - - 21,290 21,290 Buildings 5.1 Residential - 118 - 118 Specialised - - 911,432 911,432 - 775 932,722 933,497 2017 Land 5.1 Car - 18,900 - 18,900 Residential - 689 - 689 Specialised - - 50,155 50,155 Buildings 5.1 Residential - 121 - 121 Specialised - - 24,154 24,154 - 19,710 74,309 94,019 There were no transfers between Levels 1, 2 or 3 during the current and previous periods. 125 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE125 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2018 8.3 Fair value measurements (cont.) Valuation processes The Health Service obtains independent valuations of land and bu ildings from the Western Australian Land Information Authority (Valuations and Property Analytics) annually. There were no changes in valuation techniques during the period. Transfers in and out of a fair value level are recognised on the date of the event or change in ci rcumstances that caused the t ransfer. Transfers are generally limited to assets newly classified as non-current assets held for sale as Treasurer's instructions require valuations of land a nd buildings to be categorised within Level 3 where the valuations will utilise signi ficant Level 3 inputs on a recurring basis. Valuation techniques to derive Level 2 fair values Level 2 fair values of land and buildings (open car parks and conv erted residential properties) are derived using the market ap proach. This approach provides an indication of value by comparing the asset with identical or si milar properties for which price information is available. Analy sis of comparable sales information and market data provides the basis for fair value measurement. The best evidence of fair value is current prices in an active market for similar properties. Where such information is not available, Landgate Valuations and Property Analytics consider current prices in an active market fo r properties of different nature or recent prices of similar p roperties in less active markets, and adjust the valuation for differences in proper ty characteristics and market conditions. For properties with buildings and other im provements, the land value is measured by comparison and analysis of open market tran sactions on the assumption that the land is in a vacant and marketable condi tion. The amount determined is deducted fr om the total property value and the resid ual amount represents the building value. The Health Service's residential properties consist of residential buildings that have been re-configured to be used as health centres or clinics.

These properties do not normally have a feasible alternativ e use due to restrictions or limitations on their use and di sposal. The existing use is their highest and best use. Land (Level 3 fair values) For current use land assets, fair value is measured firstly by establishing the opportunity cost of public purpose land, which is termed the hypothetical alternate land use value. This approach assumes unencumbered land use base d upon potential highest and best alternative use as represente d by surrounding land uses and market analysis. 127 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE127 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2018 8.3 Fair value measurements (cont.) Fair value of the land is then determined on the assumption that the site is rehabilitated to a vacant marketable condition. Th is requires costs associated with rehabilitation to be deducted from the hypothetical alternate land use value of the land. Costs may include building demolition , clearing, planning approvals and time allowances associated with realising that potential. In some instances the legal, physical, ec onomic and socio political restrictions on a land results in a minimal or negative cur rent use land value. In this situation the land value adopted is the higher of the calculated rehabilit ation amount or the amount determined on the basis of compariso n to market corroborated evidence of land with low level utility. Land of low level utility is co nsidered to be grazing land on the urban fringe of the metropoli tan area with no economic farming potential or foreseeable development or redev elopment potential at the measurement date. Buildings (Level 3 fair values) The Health Service's hospitals and medical centres are specialised buildings valued under the cost approach. This approach uses the depreciated replacement cost method which estimates the current co st of reproduction or replacement of the buildings, on its current site, less deducti on for physical deterioration and relevant forms of obsolescence. Depreciat ed replacement cost is the current replacem ent cost of an asset less, where applicable , accumulated depreciation calculated on the basis of such cost to reflect the already consumed or expired future economic benefits of the asset. The techniques involved in the determination of the current replacement costs include: a) Review and updating of the 'as-co nstructed' drawing documentation; b) Categorisation of the drawings using the Building Utilisatio n Categories (BUC's) which designate the functional areas within the clinical fac ilities. Each BUC has different cost ra tes which are calculated from the hist orical construction costs of sim ilar clinical facilities and are adj usted for the year-to-year change in building costs using building cost index; c) Measurement of t he general floor areas; d) Application of the BUC cost rates per square meter of general floor areas. The maximum effective age used in the valuation of specialised bu ildings is 50 years. The effective age of buildings is initial ly calculated from the commissioning date, and is reviewed after the buildings have unde rgone substantial renewal, upgrade or expansion. The straight line method of depreciation is applied to derive th e depreciated replacement cost, assuming a uniform pattern of c onsumption over the initial 37 years of asset life (up to 75% of current replacement costs). All spec ialised buildings are assumed to have a residual value of 25% o f their current replacement costs. The valuations are prepared on a going concern basis until the year in which the current use is discontinued. Buildings with definite demolition plan are not subject to annual revaluation. The depreciated replacement costs at the last va luation dates for these buildings are written down to the Statement of Comprehensive Income as depreciation expenses over their remaining useful life.

Where applicable, the Health Service plans to apply the following Aus tralian Accounting Standards from their application date. Operative for reporting periods beginning on/after AASB 9 Financial Instruments This Standard supersedes AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement , introducing a number of changes to accounting treatments. The mandatory application date of this Standard is cu rrently 1 January 2018 afte r 2012-6, AASB 2013-9 and AASB 2014-1 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards .

The mandatory application date of this Standard is currently 1 January 2019 after being amended by AASB 2016-7. The Health Service's income is prin cipally derived from appropriations which will be measur ed under AASB 1058 and will be unaffected by this change. However, the Heal th Service has not yet determined the potential impact of the Standard on 'Patient charges' and 'Other fees for serv ices' revenues. In broad terms, it is anticipated that the terms and conditions attached to these revenues will defer revenue recognition until the Health Service has discharged its performance obligations.1 Jan 2019 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE130 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2018 9.1 Events occurring after the end of the reporting period There were no events occurring after the reporting period which had significant financial effects on these financial statements . 9.2 Future impact of Australian Standards issued not yet operative The Health Service cannot early adopt an Australian Accounting Standard unless specif ically permitted by TI 1101 Application of Australian Accounting Standards and Other Pronouncements or by an exemption fr om TI 1101.

Whilst the impact of AASB 16 has not yet been quantified, t he Health Service currently has commitments for $8.4 million worth of non-cancellabl e operating leases which will mostly be br ought onto the Statem ent of Financial Position, excepting amounts pertinent to short-term or low-va lue leases. Interest and amortisation expenses will increase and operating lease expense will decrease. 1 Jan 2019 AASB 1058 Income of Not-for-Profit Entities This Standard clarifies and simplifies the income recogniti on requirements that apply to not-for-profit (NFP) entities, more closely reflecting the economic reality of NFP entity transactions that are not contra cts with customers. Timing of income recognition is dependent on whether such a tran saction gives rise to a liability or other performance obligation (a promise to transfer a good or service), or a contribution by owners, related to an asset (such as cash or another asset) received by an entity. The Health Se rvice has not yet determined the application or the potential impact of the Standard. 1 Jan 2019 AASB 1059 Service Concession Ar rangements: Grantors This Standard addresses the accounting for a service concession arrangement (a type of public private partnership) by a grantor that is a public sector entity by prescribing the accounting fo r the arrangement from the grantor's perspective. Timing and measurement for the recognition of a specific asset class occurs on commencement of the arrangement and the accounting for associated liabilities is determined by whether the grantee is paid by the grantor or users of the public servic e provided. The Health Service has not identified any public private partnerships within scope of the Standard. 1 Jan 2019 AASB 2010-7 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from AASB 9 (December 2010) [AASB 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 101, 102, 108, 112, 118, 120, 121, 127, 128, 131, 132, 136, 137, 139, 1023 & 1038 and Int 2, 5, 10, 12, 19 & 127] This Standard makes consequential amendments to other Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations as a result of issuing AASB 9 in December 2010.

Tracking the number of patients who experience unplanned readmissions to WA health system hospitals within 28 days for selected surgical procedures assists in assessing the quality of hospital services provided to the community. Unplanned readmissions are those readmissions where the principal diagnosis and readmission interval indicate that the readmission may be related to the care provided by the hospital in an index surgical episode of care. This indicator measures readmissions to any public hospital or as a public patient in Contracted Health Entities. Readmission rate is considered a global performance measure, as it potentially points to deficiencies in the functioning of the overall healthcare system. Good intervention, appropriate treatment together with good discharge planning will decrease the likelihood of unplanned hospital readmissions. A low unplanned readmission rate suggests that good clinical practice is in operation within our health system, and lessons can be learnt from a higher than target unplanned readmission rate through the creation of a variety of improvement strategies. The surgeries selected to be measured by this indicator have a risk associated with post-surgery complications. Good discharge plans can help to decrease the likelihood of unplanned hospital readmissions, by providing patients with the care instructions they need after a hospital stay and by helping patients recognise symptoms that may require immediate medical attention. However, it is important to note that unplanned hospital readmissions may or may not be related to the previous visit, and some unplanned readmissions are not preventable.Unplanned hospital readmissions of public hospital patients within 28 days for selected surgical procedures Target The 2017 targets are based on the total child and adult population, and for each procedure is: SURGICAL PROCEDURETARGET (PER 1,000) Knee Replacement 26.2 Hip Replacement 17.2 Tonsillectomy & Adenoidectomy 61.0 Hysterectomy 41.3 Prostatectomy 38.8 Cataract Surgery 1.1 Appendicectomy 32.9 Performance is demonstrated by a result that is equal to or below the target.159 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE159 Results The rates of unplanned readmissions within 28 days to a Child and Adolescent Health Service (CAHS) hospital for selected surgical procedures in 2016 and 2017 are presented in Figure 3. The rate of unplanned readmission for tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy was 87.8 per 1,000, which is above the target of 61.0 per 1,000. This result reflects the conservative approach that CAHS takes to managing patients, whereby parents are advised to stay in the metropolitan area post- surgery and to re-present to hospital should they have any concerns. Managing the pain experienced by younger patients following tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy can be challenging, as it changes rapidly over the first few days after surgery, thereby requiring regular assessment and delivery of the appropriate amounts of medicine. Barriers to effective pain relief in children include the frequency of administering medicine (including the need to wake them), the taste and volume of medicine to be consumed, and the pain swallowing medicine can cause. The rate of unplanned readmissions for appendicectomy was 20.8 per 1,000, which is below the target of 32.9 per 1,000. There were no unplanned readmissions for cataract surgery, and CAHS did not perform any knee replacements, hip replacements, hysterectomies or prostatectomies in 2017.2016 N/AFigure 3 Rate of unplanned readmissions within 28 days for selected surgical procedures, 2016 to 2017 2017 TARGET 61.0 2016 TARGET 71.0 2017 TARGET 26.2 22.0 2017 TARGET 17.2 2016 N/AKNEE REPLACEMENT 2017 N/A 2017 26.2HIP PER PER 1,000 61.02016 1,000 PER 1,000 Notes: 1.

Waiting lists are actively managed by hospitals to ensure all patients are treated in clinically appropriate timeframes. Patients should be prioritised based on their assigned clinical urgency category: Category 1 - procedures that are clinically indicated within 30 days Category 2 - procedures that are clinically indicated within 90 days Category 3 - procedures that are clinically indicated within 365 days. On 1 April 2016, the WA health system introduced a new state-wide performance target for the provision of elective services. The new target requires no patients (0%) on the elective waiting lists wait longer than the clinically recommended time for their procedure, according to their urgency category. Reportable cases are defined as all waiting list cases that are not listed on the Elective Services Wait List Data Collection Commonwealth Non-Reportable Procedures list. This list is consistent with the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) list of Code 2 (other) procedures that do not meet the definition of elective surgery. It also includes additional procedure codes that are intended to better reflect the procedures identified in the AIHW Code 2 list. Target The 2017-18 target is 0 per cent for each urgency category. Performance is demonstrated by a result that is equal to the target. Results In 2017-18, CAHS maintained a high level of performance with surgical waitlisting of patients and treating them within recommended timeframes. Figure 4 shows that only 0.7 per cent of Category 1 patients were not treated within 30 days, 0.6 per cent of Category 2 patients were not treated within 90 days and 0.1 per cent of Category 3 patients were not treated within 365 days. The hospital's Surgical Directorate routinely audits waitlist categorisations to ensure treatment is booked efficiently and effectively. In 2017-18, additional effort to reduce Category 1 over boundary cases was made prior to the move to Perth Children's Hospital (PCH). Factors that contribute to patient treatment going over boundary include the availability of surgeons and whether patients are ready for care. The move to PCH in June 2018 and the commensurate reduction of elective surgery to facilitate training and commissioning had a slightly negative effect on performance in the last few months of the financial year. Even small variations in performance will cause the hospital to exceed the 0 per cent over boundary targets, and the results for 2017-18 reflect this.OUTCOME 1 - EFFECTIVENESS KPI Proportion of elective wait list patients waiting over boundary for reportable procedures CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE162 Figure 4 Proportion of elective wait list patients waiting over boundary for reportable procedures, by urgency category, 2016-17 to 2017-18 CATEGORY 1 30 DAYSCATEGORY 2 0.0% 16-17 0.0% Notes 1.

Staphylococcus aureus is a highly pathogenic organism, and even with advanced medical care, infection caused by this organism is associated with prolonged hospital stays, increased healthcare costs and a marked increase in morbidity and mortality - mortality estimated at 20-25 per cent in adults and 5 per cent in children. Healthcare associated SABSI (HA-SABSI) are generally considered to be preventable adverse events associated with the provision of healthcare. This KPI has been selected for inclusion as it is a robust KPI of the safety and quality of WA public hospitals, and aligns to the principle of increased transparency and accountability of performance information provided to the public. A low or decreasing HA-SABSI rate is desirable and a target for WA based on historical data has been set.Target The 2017 target is 1.0 HA-SABSI per 10,000 occupied bed-days. Performance is demonstrated by a result that is equal to or below the target. Result Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a bacterium found on the skin or in the nose of many individuals. In this form, it is usually harmless, and most people are unaware that they are carrying it. In the community, it is commonly spread from person to person. In hospitals, transmission is most commonly via the hands of healthcare workers and contaminated surfaces, such as furnishings and medical equipment. Bacteria from the patient's skin or from the hand of a healthcare worker can gain direct entry into the patient's bloodstream if they have an open wound or intravascular device inserted, such as central or peripheral venous catheter. CAHS provides a range of specialised services, including emergency medicine, intensive care, cardiothoracic surgery and oncology. Many patients are therefore at higher risk of infection than those at hospitals providing less specialised services. In 2017, CAHS recorded a Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection rate of 1.03 per 10,000 occupied bed- days, which is marginally above the WA health system target (see Figure 5), but below the national benchmark of 2.0 per 10,000 bed-days2.OUTCOME 1 - EFFECTIVENESS KPI Hospital infection rates (HA-SABSI) per 10,000 occupied bed-days in public hospitals 2 Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2017.

Data source: Healthcare Infection Surveillance Western Australia Data Collection.CAHS recognises all S. aureus infections as significant clinical incidents by assigning the highest Severity Assessment Code of SAC1. Root Cause Analyses are conducted to determine the reasons for infection and inform mitigation strategies. New strategies to reduce the rate of infection that have either been introduced in 2018 or are under consideration include: decolonising all patients undergoing high risk surgical procedures rather than just those colonised with S. aureus screening patients due to receive chemotherapy for malignancy, and decolonising those demonstrated to be colonised with S. aureus ongoing compliance assessment and training to ensure best practice guidelines are used when managing central venous access devices and peripheral intravenous cannulas preferential use of skin preparations containing alcohol, which is demonstrated to reduce the rate of surgical wound infection.Figure 5 Hospital infection rates (HA-SABSI) per 10,000 occupied bed-days in public hospitals, 2017 HA-SABSI RATE 1.0 1.03TARGET ACTUAL17-18 1.03 2017 per 10,000 occupied bed-daysTarget per 10,000 occupied bed-days 1.03 1.0TARGET 1.0 165 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE165 Survival rates for sentinel conditions Rationale This indicator measures hospital performance in relation to restoring the health of people who have suffered a sentinel condition - specifically a stroke and acute myocardial infarction. For these conditions, a good recovery is more likely when there is early intervention and appropriate care on presentation to an emergency department and on admission to hospital. These two conditions have been chosen as they are particularly significant for the healthcare of the community, and are leading causes of death and hospitalisation in Australia3. Patient survival after being admitted for one of these two sentinel conditions can be affected by many factors that include the diagnosis, the treatment given or procedure performed, age, co-morbidities at the time of the admission and complications that may have developed while in hospital. Hospital survival indicators, including this KPI, are considered screening tools, as they are not definitively diagnostic of poor quality and/or safety.Target The 2017 targets are based on the total child and adult population, and for each procedure, by age group, is: SENTINEL CONDITION AGE GROUP (YEARS)STROKE (%)ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (%) 0-49 94.3 99.2 Performance is demonstrated by a result that is equal to or above the target. Results The very low number of cases of stroke treated each year means that the calculated survival rate is prone to be highly volatile from one year to the next, and must be interpreted with caution. In 2017, CAHS recorded a survival rate of 84.2 per cent (Figure 6). It should be noted that all deaths were thoroughly reviewed by the hospital's Mortality and Morbidity Review Committee, and none were found to be preventable. Acute myocardial infarction is rare in children and adolescents. Like last year, CAHS did not treat any patients with this condition in 2017, and hence there is no result to report (Figure 7).OUTCOME 1 - EFFECTIVENESS KPI 3 These conditions are a leading cause of death and hospitalisation across the entire Australian population. The Child and Adolescent Health Service treats patients aged 0-17 years, for whom these conditions are extremely uncommon. CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE166 Notes 1.

The inclusion of this new KPI will assist in measuring the success of these initiatives. A high percentage reported for this KPI will reflect the need for improved responses by the health system to the needs of Aboriginal patients, and provides a measure of the quality of the services provided. Patients who left against medical advice (also called discharged against medical advice or DAMA) have been found to cost the health system 50 per cent more than the cost of patients who are discharged by physicians4. Published data contends that high DAMA rates reflect the need for improved responses by the health system to the needs of Aboriginal patients, and provides a measure of the safety, quality and cultural security of the services provided. Monitoring this indicator will enable identification of performance improvement opportunities, as well as the collaborative and effective addressing of the underlying factors in achieving an equitable treatment outcome for Aboriginal patients. Target The 2017 target is 0.77 per cent. Performance is demonstrated by a result that is equal to or below the target. Results In 2017, CAHS recorded a rate of discharge against medical advice of 0.30 per cent for Aboriginal patients, and 0.09 per cent for non-Aboriginal patients. Both these results are below the target of 0.77 per cent (see Figure 8). A contributing factor to the favourable result for Aboriginal patients is the Koorliny Moort (Walking with Families) program. The program aims to provide better care coordination delivery by engaging Aboriginal people early in their health care and providing effective communication between health services, led by Aboriginal service providers.Percentage of admitted Aboriginal and Non-Aboriginal patients who discharged against medical adviceOUTCOME 1 - EFFECTIVENESS KPI 4 Aliyu ZY.

Data source: Hospital Morbidity Data Collection.ABORIGINAL PATIENTS NON-ABORIGINAL PATIENTS 0.77% 0.77% 0.77% 169 Rationale Readmission rate is considered to be a global performance measure, as it potentially points to deficiencies in the functioning of the overall mental healthcare system. While multiple hospital admissions over a lifetime may be necessary for someone with ongoing illness, a high proportion of readmissions shortly after discharge may indicate that inpatient treatment was either incomplete or ineffective, or that follow- up care was not adequate to maintain the patient's recovery out of hospital. These readmissions mean that patients spend additional time in hospital and utilise additional resources. A low readmission rate suggests that good clinical practice is in operation. This indicator is reported at the facility at which the initial admission occurred rather than the facility at which the patient was readmitted. By measuring and monitoring this indicator, key areas for improvement can be identified. This in turn can facilitate the development and delivery of targeted care pathways and interventions, which can aim to improve mental health and quality of life of Western Australians.Target The 2017 target is 12 per cent5. Performance is demonstrated by a result that is equal to or below the target. Result The rate of total hospital readmissions within 28 days to an acute designated mental health inpatient unit comprises both planned and unplanned readmissions. The Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service provides planned admissions for those who require frequent inpatient admissions and non-acute interventions. This is usually complementary to community provided care. There are also many instances where the return of young people to hospital is not planned, but is also not unexpected given the nature of their conditions. In 2017, the rate of total hospital readmissions within 28 days to an acute designated mental health inpatient unit was 28.3 per cent, which is above the target of 12 per cent (Figure 9). It should be noted that a high readmission rate does not necessarily mean poor clinical practice. And while a low readmission rate may indicate clinical effectiveness, it can also indicate resource limitations, such as a lack of access to beds. The inability to distinguish planned and unplanned readmissions affects the interpretation of this indicator. This is because there are benefits to returning the patient to the community in anticipation of readmitting them later, which not only improves their recovery, but reduces the total cost of their treatment. In this case, the result includes many instances where the return of young people to hospital was required to attend to progressive and chronic conditions that do not require long term admission. Frequent admissions are currently being used as part of an evidence- based clinical package of care for a young person with a chronic condition.Rate of total hospital readmissions within 28 days to an acute designated mental health inpatient unitOUTCOME 1 - EFFECTIVENESS KPI 5The source of this target was the Fourth National Mental Health Measurement Strategy (May 2011) produced by the Mental Health Information Strategy Subcommittee, Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council, Mental Health Standing Committee. http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/ content/1ED20240320A3A11CA257D9B007B31C6/$File/meas.pdf CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE170 TARGET 12% Notes 1.

Therefore, it is crucial to ensure effective and appropriate care is provided not only in a hospital setting, but also in the community. Discharge from hospital is a critical transition point in the delivery of mental health care. People leaving hospital after an admission for an episode of mental illness have heightened levels of vulnerability and, without adequate follow up, may relapse or be readmitted. This KPI measures the performance of the overall health system in providing continuity of mental health care. A responsive community support system for people who have experienced a psychiatric episode requiring hospitalisation is essential to maintain their clinical and functional stability and to minimise the need for hospital readmissions. Patients leaving hospital after a psychiatric admission with a formal discharge plan, involving linkages with public community based services and support, are less likely to need avoidable readmission.The standard underlying the measure is that continuity of care involves prompt community follow-up in the vulnerable period following discharge from hospital. Overall, the variation in post-discharge follow-up rates suggests important differences between mental health systems in terms of their practices. Target The 2017 target is 75 per cent. Performance is demonstrated by a result that is equal to or above the target. Result In 2017, 72.4 per cent of young people who were admitted to a CAHS mental health inpatient unit were contacted by a community-based public mental health non-admitted health service within seven days of discharge (Figure 10). This result is marginally below the aspirational target of 75 per cent. The variance to target is due to multiple factors. Not all patients elect to schedule an appointment within seven days, and some choose not to make an appointment at all. Contact with parents (e.g. due to the age of the patient) is not included in the result even where it occurs within seven days. Some patients are discharged to health professionals in the private and not for profit sectors. These services do not use the Psychiatric Services Online Information System, so it is not possible to confirm follow up activity occurred within seven days. The result is therefore very likely to under-report actual performance.Percentage of contacts with community-based public mental health non-admitted services within seven days post-discharge from an acute public mental health inpatient unitOUTCOME 1 - EFFECTIVENESS KPI 6 National Health Survey http://www. ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/subscriber.nsf/0/ CDA852A349B4CEE6CA257F150009FC53/$File/national%20 health%20survey%20first%20results,%202014-15.pdf CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE172 Notes 1.

In order to ensure quality care and cost effectiveness, it is important to monitor the unit cost of admitted patient care in specialised mental health inpatient units. The efficient use of hospital resources can help minimise the overall costs of providing mental healthcare, and enable the reallocation of funds to appropriate alternative non-admitted care. Target The 2017-18 target is $4,543 per bed-day. Performance is demonstrated by a result that is equal to or below the target. Result In 2017-18, the average cost per bed-day in specialised mental health inpatient units was $4,163, which is below the target and less than the average cost in 2016-17. Improved cost efficiency is the result of an increase in the average number of inpatient beds operated; from 14 in 2016-17 to 19 in 2017-18. Despite the challenges the delayed opening of Perth Children's Hospital presented, the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service Inpatient Unit undertook significant reform during 2017-18, including changes to its workforce profile, which further improved efficiency.Average cost per bed-day in specialised mental health inpatient unitsOUTCOME 1 - EFFICIENCY KPI - SERVICE 4: MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES Notes 1. The original target of $4,287 published in the 2017 -18 State Budget has been revised to include funding for mental health inpatient teaching, training and research Data sources: Health Service financial system, BedState.Figure 14 Average cost per bed-day in specialised mental health inpatient units, 2016-17 to CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE177Rationale Efficient functioning of public community mental health services is critical to ensure that finite funds are used effectively to deliver maximum community benefit. Services provided by public community- based mental health services include assessment, treatment and continuing care. The majority of services provided by public community-based mental health services are for people in the acute phase of a mental illness who are receiving post-acute care. This indicator gives a measure of the cost effectiveness of treatment for public psychiatric patients under public community mental healthcare (non-admitted and ambulatory patients). Target The 2017-18 target is $771 per treatment day. Performance is demonstrated by a result that is equal to or below the target.Result In 2017-18, the average cost per treatment day of non-admitted care provided by public clinical mental health services was $650, which is below the target. Demand for community based mental health services increased during 2017-18, particularly for urgent local response services. Despite this increase in demand, a number of reform initiatives undertaken by the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service led to more treatment days being provided and more timely access to services.

With the aim of improving health, population health works to integrate all activities of the health sector and link them with broader social and economic services and resources by utilising the WA Health Promotion Strategic Framework 2017-2021. This is based on the growing understanding of the social, cultural and economic factors that contribute to a person's health status. Target The 2017-18 target is $262 per person. Performance is demonstrated by a result that is equal to or below the target.Result In 2017-18, the average cost per person of delivering population health programs was $222, which is comparable to the average cost per person in 2016-17 and below the target of $262 (Figure 16). The variance to target is attributable to an overestimate of expenditure used when developing the 2017-18 WA health system budget, and a higher population being served than anticipated.Average cost per person of delivering population health programs by population health unitsOUTCOME 2 - EFFICIENCY KPI - SERVICE 6: PUBLIC AND COMMUNITY HEALTH SERVICES Figure 16 Average cost per person of delivering population health programs by population health units, 2016-17 to 2017-18 Notes 1.

The above list of boards is as per the State Government Boards and Committees Register. 2. Remuneration is provided to private sector and consumer representative members of a board/committee. Individuals are ineligible for remuneration if their membership on the board/committee is considered to be an integral part of their organisational role.3. Remuneration amounts can vary depending on the type of remuneration, the number of meetings attended, and whether a member submitted a remuneration claim. 4. 'Period of membership' is defined as the period (in months) that an individual was a member of a board/committee during the 2017-18 financial year. Pricing policy The National Health Reform Agreement sets the policy framework for the charging of public hospital fees and charges. Under the Agreement, an eligible person who receives public hospital services as a public patient in a public hospital or a publicly contracted bed in a private hospital is treated 'free of charge'. This arrangement is consistent with the Medicare principles which are embedded in the Health Services Act 2016 (WA). The majority of hospital fees and charges for public hospitals are set under Schedule 1 of the Health Services (Fees and Charges) Order 2016 and are reviewed annually. The following informs WA public hospital patients' fees and charges for: Compensable or ineligible patients Patients who are either 'private' or 'compensable' and Medicare ineligible (overseas residents) may be charged an amount for public hospital services as determined by the State. The setting of compensable and ineligible hospital accommodation fees is set close to, or at, full cost recovery. CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE182Private patients (Medicare eligible Australian residents) The Commonwealth Department of Health regulates the Minimum Benefit payable by health funds to privately insured patients for private shared ward and same day accommodation. The Commonwealth also regulates the Nursing Home Type Patient 'contribution' based on March and September pension increases. To achieve consistency with the Commonwealth Private Health Insurance Act 2007, the State sets these fees at a level equivalent to the Commonwealth Minimum Benefit. Veterans Hospital charges of eligible war service veterans are determined under a separate Commonwealth- State agreement with the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Under this agreement, the Department of Health does not charge medical treatment to eligible war service veteran patients, instead medical charges are fully recouped from the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Other fees and charges The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme regulates and sets the price of pharmaceuticals supplied to outpatients, patients on discharge and for day admitted chemotherapy patients. Inpatient medications are supplied free of charge. There are other categories of fees specified under the terms of Health Services (Fees and Charges) Order 2016, which include the supply of surgically implanted prostheses, orthoses, Magnetic Resonance Imaging services and pathology services. The pricing for these hospital services is determined according to their cost of service.Capital works The WA health system has a substantial Asset Investment Program that facilitates re-modelling and development of health infrastructure. Program initiatives include the continuation of major projects to reconfigure metropolitan tertiary hospitals, equipment replacement and minor building works. Please refer to Table 7 for financial details of the Child and Adolescent Health (CAHS) capital works program.Major capital projects completed during the year include the construction of the Perth Children's Hospital in Nedlands. Management and control of the facility transferred from the Health Ministerial Body to CAHS on the date of the first patient arrival on 14 May 2018.

CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE184Workforce development CAHS is committed to the training and development of staff to support the delivery of quality health services. Essential corporate training is provided to all new staff and includes: accountable and ethical decision making record keeping awareness Aboriginal cultural awareness emergency procedures occupational health and safety infection control. Additional ongoing training is available to staff in the areas of human resource management, recruitment, selection and appointment, cultural diversity and professional codes of conduct (including bullying in the workplace.) Specific role-related clinical and non-clinical training and education is provided by health service sites, delivered either internal or external to the organisation and through online e-learning resources. Additionally, ongoing undergraduate, graduate, staff training and leadership development programs are available to employees. There is a range of general corporate training courses (conducted under policies) including: 1) Corporate induction program and an orientation to work areas for new staff. Topics covered include: a) infection control b) cultural awarenessc) human resources d) occupational safety and health e) emergency preparedness f) child protection 2) General management skills training programs, including: a) assertive communication b) bullying in the workplace (Code of Conduct) c) conflict resolution d) recruitment selection and appointment e) performance development, namely: i. coaching for improved performance ii. managing substandard performance CAHS training courses are offered either as face- to-face programs, or as an e-learning program using adult learning principles and practices. Training courses contain a feedback mechanism for participants for continuous improvement. Further to this, compliance with and reporting for the Speaking Up for Safety program is monitored by Workforce Education. Workforce continues to provide support to: paediatric nursing education ward-based education community health areas as and when requested, covering topics areas such as management development, and recruiting and selection policies.Perth Children's Hospital education and training The CAHS Learning Management System (iLearn), implemented in April 2016, continues to allow scheduling and reporting on training required as well providing a one-stop place to access online learning options. This system has been successful. More than 2,500 staff (90 per cent) completed induction and orientation training and 2,200 (80 per cent) completed pre-requisite e-learning for Perth Children's Hospital (PCH). This training includes orientation to the site and local area, emergency preparedness, infection control, information and communications technology, medications management, occupational health and safety and specialised equipment training. Industrial relations WA Health Industrial Relations Services were devolved from the Department of Health to CAHS in the 2016-17 financial year. The Industrial 185 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE185Relations function has since been fully integrated as an integral aspect of Workforce Services, working closely with colleagues from the Human Resources function. During 2017-18, CAHS experienced organisational change and restructuring within Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH), Child and Adolescent Community Health (CACH), the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) and the Corporate Support structures. Additionally, there has been the commissioning of Perth Children's Hospital, the decommissioning of Princess Margaret Hospital and the physical relocation of all staff and services from the Subiaco campus to the QEII Medical Centre campus in Nedlands. While the organisational change engagement processes started in 2015-16, it has continued throughout 2016-17 and 2017-18, with further re-alignments of medical and nursing streams within the hospital taking place in 2018-19. Due to the magnitude of restructuring and reconfigurations over the last two financial years, including the Health Service Executive team, CAHS has been consulting formally with unions to a far greater extent than previous years. This has resulted in a more positive and collaborative working relationship with the unions, creating a positive approach to resolving workplace matters in dispute. Significant effort was made in 2017-18 to create a more positive workplace culture in terms of consulting on the specific employment needs of clinical employees, with regular meetings scheduled for the newly established Clinical Advisory Group.As a result of effective and regular communication with both staff and unions on the restructuring process, there was no lost time due to industrial disputation across the health service. There were no issues directly involving CAHS that proceeded to arbitration before industrial courts or tribunals, with all such formal disputes lodged by the unions or employees being resolved through conciliation processes. Generally, there has been a noticeable increase in unions utilising internal dispute resolution processes in preference to lodging formal disputes with industrial courts or tribunals. Like the previous financial year, the number of human resource issues relating to individual employees during 2017-18, that required ongoing management, continued to surge. Human Resources and Industrial Relations staff worked collaboratively to effectively manage these individual employee matters in a timely manner, while concurrently managing matters arising from organisational change and the transition to the new hospital site. Workers' compensation The WA Workers' Compensation system was established by the State Government and exists under the statute of the Workers' Compensation and Rehabilitation Act 1981. CAHS is committed to providing staff with a safe and healthy work environment, and recognises this as pivotal in attracting and maintaining the workforce necessary to deliver effective and efficient health care services. In 2017-18, a total of 73 workers' compensation claims were made (see Table 9).Governance disclosures Unauthorised use of credit cards The WA health system uses Purchasing Cards for purchasing goods and services to achieve savings through improved administrative efficiency and more effective cash management. The Purchasing Card is a personalised credit card that provides a clear audit trail for management. WA health system credit cards are provided to employees who require one as part of their role. Purchasing cards are not for personal use by the cardholder. Should a cardholder use a purchasing card for a personal purpose, they must give written notice to the accountable authority within five working days and refund the total amount of expenditure. Despite being made aware of obligations pertaining to the use of purchasing cards, three CAHS cardholders mistakenly used their card for personal purposes. The transactions were identified by the cardholders and repayment initiated by them, with the full amount of $209.00 being refunded during 2017-18 (see Table 10). Government policy requirements Government building contracts CAHS has a commitment to the Government Building Training Policy. CAHS included appropriate clauses in tender documentation and monitored compliance of in-scope building, construction or maintenance contractors for projects with a duration of greater than three months and a value of greater than $2 million. As at 30 June 2018, no contracts subject to the Government Building Training Policy had been awarded.

The Child and Adolescent Health Service (CAHS) received no Ministerial directives during 2017-18. Advertising In accordance with section 175Z of the Electoral Act 1907, CAHS incurred the following advertising expenditure in 2017-18 (see Table 11). Table 11: Summary of advertising for 2017-18 SUMMARY OF ADVERTISING AMOUNT ($) Advertising agencies 0 Market research organisations 0 Polling organisations 0 Direct mail organisations 0 Media advertising organisations 980.64 Total advertising expenditure 980.64 Adcorp was the only organisation to provide services in 2017-18. Disability Access and Inclusion Plan The Disability Services Act 1993 was introduced to ensure that people with disability have the same opportunities to fully access the range of health services, facilities and information available in the public health system, and to participate in public consultation regarding WA Health services. As at June 2014, amendments to the Act require public authorities to ensure that people with disability have equal employment opportunities. CAHS ensures compliance with the act and all other principles through the implementation of a Disability Access and Inclusion Plan. The CAHS Disability Access and Inclusion Plan (2018-2022) has been endorsed and published1. The CAHS Disability Access and Inclusion Working Group are responsible for development, implementation and evaluation and report to the CAHS Disability Advisory Committee. Access to service and events A range of equipment is provided by CAHS to assist people with disabilities to access services. An example of the improved quality of service includes the recent incorporation of an adult change table to cater to the toileting requirements of older children and adolescents. All relevant policies consider the access requirements of people with disabilities. Within PCH (and previously at Princess Margaret Hospital), events are held in venues that are accessible by people with disabilities. Access to buildings and other facilities Access to buildings and facilities for people with disabilities is ensured through ongoing management and maintenance. Access to Information CAHS consumer publications are available in alternative formats and languages on request, including large print and audio formats for patients with literacy or vision difficulties. The health service website has capability to assist people who are hearing impaired, as well as providing details on where people can find information and make contact with services. The health service aims to achieve a minimum of level AA rating of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 on all internal and external websites, with clear guidelines around developing content on digital platforms. Quality of service by staff An e-learning package is available on the CAHS intranet for staff education on disability access and inclusion. New staff are advised of the importance of disability access and inclusion during CAHS wide corporate induction. Regular staff presentations continue in collaboration with Department of Communities Disability Services and the WA Health Network Disability Advisory Group. In December 2017, CAHS participated in the International Day of Disability, with presentations and displays to promote awareness and inclusion. Opportunity to provide feedback All staff are available to assist people with disabilities to provide feedback. A dedicated Child and Family Engagement Service is also available during office hours. There are also easily accessible comments, complaints, and suggestion boxes available throughout CAHS facilities. The CAHS website 1http://ww2.health.wa.gov.au/~/media/Files/Corporate/ general%20documents/CAHS/CAHS%20_DAIP_2018-2022_Final_ Mar2018.pdf 189 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE189provides for comments, complaints, and suggestions to be sent via an email. Feedback is processed and managed through the Child and Family Engagement Service and discussed at the Consumer Advisory Council and the Disability Advisory Committee to ensure that any changes to policy or updates to services have consumer input. These committees have provided ongoing feedback to inform the Perth Children's Hospital project design and policy development, including access to parking, the location of adolescent change tables, and improving access to patient entertainment systems. Participation in public consultation The CAHS Disability Advisory Committee has recently been expanded to include a wider range of CAHS staff and consumer representation. Additionally, all venues for public consultation are required to meet the needs of people with disabilities. Opportunities to obtain and maintain employment CAHS uses inclusive recruitment practices and encourages people with disability to apply for positions advertised across the organisation. CAHS is working with disability employment providers to actively recruit and employ people with disabilities, and ensure that workplaces are tailored to employee needs. People with disabilities are employed in a variety of roles at CAHS. Compliance with public sector standards During 2017-18, CAHS engaged in a number of human resource activities that resulted in 12 Employment Standard Breach Claims being lodged in accordance with the Public Sector Standards in Human Resource Management Framework. This increase, up from three in the previous financial year, is attributed to CAHS' preparation and move to PCH and resulting increase in recruitment and selection activity. Seven claims were resolved internally within CAHS and four claims were referred to the Public Sector Commission for review and subsequently dismissed or declined. One employment standard breach claim remains outstanding and will be progressed in the next financial year. CAHS has appropriate systems and processes in place to inform and educate employees on their rights in accordance with the Public Sector Standards in Human Resource Management. These include a database to record and monitor human resource management activities including breach claims as well as the following policies and guidelines which are available electronically via the CAHS and WA Health intranet sites: WA Health Employee Grievance Resolution Policy CAHS Grievance Guideline WA Health Recruitment and Appointment Policy and Procedure WA Health Discipline Policy and Explanatory Notes CAHS Performance Development and Review Policy & Resource Tools Where relevant, written communication to employees provides information about the Public Sector Standards and generally about processes to achieve resolution, including breach claim rights. Additionally, the Human Resources (HR) Manager and HR Consultants are available to provide information and resources to support individual workplace concerns and Selection Panel Chairs and Line Managers on HR related issues, including recruitment and selection, performance development, grievance, potential breach of discipline, redeployment and termination. The CAHS Learning and Development framework further supports employees in this area by providing a number of training packages for staff and managers on a range of HR issues. As part of the transition to Perth Children's Hospital, all new and existing staff have completed a number of e-learning packages, including induction and compliance with the WA Health Employment Framework and local CAHS Policy and Process. Record keeping plans The State Records Act 2000 (the Act) was established to mandate the standardisation of statutory record keeping practices for every State Government agency. Government agency practice is subject of the provision of the Act, the standards and policies. Government agencies are also subject to scrutiny by the State Records Commission (SRC). Section 19 of the Act states that every government organisation must have a Record Keeping Plan (RKP) that has been approved by the State Records Commission. The CAHS RKP was approved by the SRC on 26 November 2015. In accordance with section 28 of the Act, the CAHS RKP is to be reviewed within five years and a report submitted to the State Records Office (SRO) by November 2020. An interim review has been performed and a report on CAHS progress towards completing the documented CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE190commitments was presented to the SRO in December 2017. Of significance was the recruitment of a permanent Records Manager and endorsement of a Corporate Records Management Policy. A review of the CAHS information management framework established to support staff to capture and manage corporate records is being performed and content updated to reflect the Electronic Document and Records Management System (EDRMS) upgrade to HP RM8.3 and significant organisational changes. The CAHS induction and orientation program provides new, casual and agency employees with relevant information to their employment within six weeks of commencement. The program includes reference to the WA Health Code of Conduct (which includes best practice records management) and workplace specific work practices and procedures. CAHS staff are required to complete mandatory Department of Health Records Awareness Training and CAHS EDRMS training upon allocation of a licence. The CAHS Records and Compliance intranet site (currently under review) contains training resources, quick help guides, policies, procedures, work instructions and supporting information to enable staff to comply with the Act. Over 100 staff have attended regularly scheduled classroom based training delivered by the Records and Compliance team. Staff attending training completes an evaluation form which identifies the effectiveness of the training delivery and content and allows the material to be refined. CAHS is committed to the ongoing deployment of the EDRMS throughout administrative functions and has procured additional licences to meet this need. CAHS currently has 720 licences, of which 651 are active. A system health check performed in April 2017 made 113 recommendations, of which 105 were accepted and resources directed to implement those recommendations. Of the recommendations, 76 have been implemented, 20 have transitioned to business as usual and a further nine relate to infrastructure and require additional planning and funding. During 2017-18, over 230,000 records were captured into the CAHS EDRMS. Substantive equality Child and Adolescent Community Health The Aboriginal Health Team (AHT) delivers culturally acceptable primary prevention community child health services to Aboriginal children and families across the Perth metropolitan area. Services are provided by a multidisciplinary team consisting of child health nurses and Aboriginal Health Workers. When an Aboriginal child is born in the metropolitan area, the AHT is notified via a birth notification from midwifery services. The first universal visit is conducted by the child health nurse in mainstream 191 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE191child health services. If the family requests the service of AHT or if the mainstream child health nurse is unable to contact the family after reasonable attempts, the child is referred to the AHT. Depending on family need, Aboriginal families may also be offered the Enhanced Aboriginal Child Health Schedule (EACHS). EACHS provides a more comprehensive and intensive and culturally acceptable primary health care service designed specifically to address the needs of Aboriginal families with additional health needs. The program is delivered predominantly as a home visiting model. The Refugee Health Team (RHT) helps refugee families transition to access local health services across the Perth metropolitan area and supports families with young children to access community child health services. All refugee families in the metropolitan area are referred to the RHT by the Humanitarian Health Service. Interpreters are used extensively by the RHT. Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service Six Aboriginal Mental Health Workers and Aboriginal Liaison Officers were appointed in October 2016 to work within Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) multidisciplinary teams. The role of these workers is to provide cultural support and advocacy for Aboriginal young people and their families who require access to CAMHS services. The addition of these six workers has increased the total number of Aboriginal Mental Health Workers within CAMHS to eight. A large culturally and linguistically diverse community lives and works within the Warwick CAMHS catchment. To meet the needs of this culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) community, the following two services are in operation in the area: In partnership with Child and Adolescent Community Health (CACH), the Department of Education and Edmund Rice WA, Warwick CAMHS runs Integrated Service Centres at Koondoola Primary School and Thornlie Primary School. These centres support recent refugee and humanitarian entrant children who are enrolled in Intensive English Centres at these schools to transition into their new school environments. The centres also support families with accessing mainstream education, health care and community support systems. Two CAMHS Senior Social Workers work in these Integrated Service Centres, providing specialist mental health assessments and treatment and helping families to access mainstream mental health services Warwick Community CAMHS has a specialist Cross Cultural Mental Health Clinician who provides mental health assessment and care to CALD children, adolescents and their families. This clinician uses a range of interventions when working with CALD families, including family therapy, individual psychotherapy, parental counselling, and group work. The Cross Cultural Clinician also develops and maintains collaborative working relationships with ethnic and mainstream service providers to raise community awareness of multicultural child and adolescent mental health issues. This aims to improve the delivery of culturally appropriate services for young people and their families within the community. The Cross Cultural Clinician also acts as a resource consultant for other mental health, health and community professionals within the scope of cross-cultural mental health issues. Princess Margaret Hospital and Perth Children's Hospital PCH (and previously PMH) provides culturally safe services to Aboriginal patients and their families. The Koorliny Moort 'Walking with Families' program provides care coordination for inpatients and out of hospital care to families who might find it hard to come into hospital for their appointment or who want to stay closer to home. The Aboriginal Liaison Service provides cultural and practical support and advocacy to children and CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH SERVICE192 families identified as most vulnerable within the hospital or community setting. The Kulunga Moort Mia (Aboriginal Family Lounge) located on the ground floor of PCH provides a culturally sensitive environment for Aboriginal families that aims to enhance their healthcare experience and promote engagement with mainstream health services. The Refugee Health Service provides holistic multidisciplinary health care to refugee and asylum- seeker children, adolescents and their families within Western Australia. Consultative review of refugee and asylum children during and after an inpatient episode of care is also provided. Occupational safety, health and injury CAHS is committed to the provision of a safe work environment for all employees, volunteers, patients, clients, visitors, and contractors in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Act 1984 and the injury management requirements of the Workers' Compensation and Injury Management Act 1981.
