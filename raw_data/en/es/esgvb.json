Those post-holiday, January blues might be starting to settle in as we move further away from family gatherings and online shopping. Most of us are feeling a little bit groggy, bogged down or even sluggish. This could be as a result of major holiday stress, not enough sleep, too much pie or a combination of it all. So this year, instead of focusing on a short-lived diet, we'd like to introduce 5 new ways to jumpstart your body and mind. No deprivation diets, hunger pangs or weight loss goals involved. This is about loving your body back into balance in 2021! Here's how to get started: - Write Your List: The best way to begin a jumpstart or reset is with a list of things you'd like to accomplish. It's important to remember that a jumpstart isn't about a number on a scale. While weight loss can be a byproduct of the goals you set, we don't believe it should be the main focus. In fact, studies show that when you focus on other health related goals outside of just weight loss your weight drops faster and stays lower longer. To get started, try to focus on 1-2 fitness related goals like improving your mile time, adding in one more group exercise classes online or doing one more pull up on your pull up bar. Then, add in 1-2 nutrition related goals. Again, these are inclusive goals like a promise to include a healthy fat at every meal, drink kombucha instead of wine or enjoy takeout only once per week. Lastly, write down 1-2 self healing goals. Self healing goals are things that you know truly make you feel good. For example, set aside 30 minutes to read at night, sign up for a fun online course, or book a covid-safe massage. Your goals are your own so set some that really push you and then others that make you feel wonderful and honor your body for working hard. - Take Activated Charcoal: We've written about the healing powers of activated charcoal before and that's because it's a fantastic remedy to add to your routine. Activated charcoal is the most ancient detoxifying ingredient known to man. It's been used in Chinese medicine and ayurveda for thousands of years. When activated charcoal enters the body it binds to toxins that can then only be excreted through the bowels. So, it's great way to jumpstart after a night of unhealthy foods, too much alcohol or if you're just trying to clean out your body. Please note that activated charcoal may bind to any supplements or medications that you take so don't take it if you're on any sort of medicine or important supplements. Also, consult a doctor if you're on any serious medication before you use charcoal. - Add in Nutrients: Let's flip traditional dieting culture on its head. Instead of declaring that you are going to eliminate sugar and carbs for the next 30 days, focus on adding in nutrient dense foods to your diet wherever possible. Add kale to your eggs in the morning, stir coconut oil into your coffee, add a protein to your salad or sandwich and drink lots of water. When you're able to focus on nutrients like coconut oil, whole eggs, kale, grass fed beef and organic whole chocolate, it begins to crowd out less nutrient dense foods in your diet. There just isn't room anymore for some of the unhealthier foods that make you feel sluggish. - Stimulate Your Lymphatic System: Your lymphatic system is what helps eliminate toxins from you body, but it's not always easy to get your lymphatic system going. Some great ways to stimulate it include exercise (even just light walking), sweating in a sauna, dry brushing or jumping on a trampoline or rebounder. One of our personal favorites is dry brushing before a shower. This gets the lymphatic system going, is great for reducing cellulite and also helps with energy production. - Get Uncomfortable: A jumpstart shouldn't be a huge struggle, nor should you feel deprived. But remember, change also isn't a walk in the park. If it were easy, everyone would do it. The only way to form new habits and really change your body and mind is to get a little bit uncomfortable. When we say uncomfortable, it means that we want you to stretch yourself a little bit every day. This could mean that you focus on adding in 1-2 new veggies that you've never cooked this week or that you spend an extra 10 minutes in the morning preparing lunch or meditating. It could also mean adding a new exercise class to your routine or perhaps you opt for Perrier at your next happy hour instead of a glass of wine. Rather than think or talk about healthy change, actually implement it during your jumpstart and notice how you feel. It's during transition and change that we make the most progress. "}
