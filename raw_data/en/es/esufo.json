Wolff, MS4, and Diane J. Madlon-Kay, MD, MS Background: In 2011, an outbreak of measles in Minnesota was traced back to an unvaccinated Somali child. The purpose of this project was to (1) ascertain whether Somali parents are more likely than non-Somalis to refuse childhood vaccinations, particularly the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccineand (2) determine what factors influence the decision not to vaccinate. Methods: We explored parental perceptions and utilization of vaccines through a survey distributed to a convenience sample of Somali and non-Somali parents of children <5 years old in a family medi- cine clinic in Minneapolis, MN. Results: A total of 99 surveys were completed, 28% (n /H1154927) by Somali parents. Somali parents were more likely than non-Somali parents to have refused the MMR vaccine for their child (odds ratio, 4.6; 95% condence interval, 1.2-18.0). Most of them refused vaccines because they had heard of adverseeffects associated with the vaccine or personally knew someone who suffered an adverse effect. Somaliparents were signicantly more likely to believe that autism is caused by vaccines (35% vs. 8% of non-Somali parents). Somalis were also more likely to be uncomfortable with administering multiple vac-cines at one visit (odds ratio, 4.0; 95% condence interval, 1.4 -11.9) and more likely to believe thatchildren receive too many vaccines. Conclusions: Statistically signicant differences in perceptions and use of vaccines were reported by Somali and non-Somali participants. Somali parents are more likely to believe that the MMR vaccinecauses autism and more likely to refuse the MMR vaccine than non-Somali parents. These beliefs havecontributed to an immunization gap between Somali and non-Somali children. (J Am Board Fam Med2014;27:458 - 464.) Keywords: Autism, Measles, Somalia, Vaccination, Immunization Measles is one of the most contagious human dis- eases; approximately 1 in 3000 infected patients die,despite modern medical care. Measles infectionsaccount for 50% of the 1.6 million deaths world-wide each year that are attributed to vaccine-pre-ventable childhood diseases. 1Effective vaccinationfor measles began in 1963 and led to a dramatic decline in the incidence of measles infections. Thedisease was declared eliminated from the UnitedStates in 2000. Since then, however, measles im-ported from other countries and low vaccination coverage has continued to put communities at risk.In 2011, 222 cases of measles occurred in theUnited States\u2014the highest rate of infection in 15years\u2014most of which were caused by unvaccinatedtravelers who contracted the disease abroad andreturned to spread the infection to unvaccinatedcontacts. 2The largest of the 2011 outbreaks oc- curred in Minnesota: 21 cases of measles were re-ported, more than the previous 14 years combined.This outbreak was traced back to an unvaccinatedSomali child recently returned to Minnesota fromabroad. 3Minnesota has the largest Somali popula- tion in the United States, estimated at between25,000 and 40,000 people. 4This article was externally peer reviewed.

Downloaded from Anecdotal evidence suggests that Somalis have expressed serious concerns over the safety of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine .4Previous work in Sweden and the United Kingdom showedthat Somali parents are generally positive in theirviews of vaccines but express serious concern overthe MMR vaccine in particular. 5,6Autism and the MMR vaccine seem to be closely linked by Somalicommunities. Not only do Somali parents seem tobelieve that MMR causes autism, they also believethat autism is more common in their communitythan among the larger population. 4It is thought that these fears have caused a reduction in thenumber of Somali children in the United States andelsewhere who are vaccinated for MMR. Althoughthe Somali belief that MMR causes autism is widelyacknowledged by physicians and public health ser-vices and measles outbreaks have been traced backto unvaccinated Somali children, little research hasexplored Somali vaccination rates, parental deci-sion making regarding the MMR vaccine, or theirbeliefs about vaccine safety. The purpose of this project was to ascertain whether Somali parents are indeed less likely thannon-Somalis to vaccinate their children for MMRand other diseases. In addition, we wanted to knowwhat factors influence Somali parents' decision notto vaccinate and how they perceive the risks andbenets of vaccinations. Materials and Methods We explored parental perceptions and use of vac-cines through a survey distributed to a conveniencesample of Somali and non-Somali parents of chil-dren/H113495 years old at Smiley's Clinic in Minneap- olis, MN. The clinic is a family medicine residencyclinic located in a neighborhood with a large So-mali population. We developed a 35-item survey (provided in the Appendix) covering the topics of children's vacci-nation status, reasons for vaccination compliance/noncompliance, sources of education/informationon health topics, vaccination safety, the MMR-autism link, and demographics. The survey waspiloted with Somali patients and interpreters toconrm that the survey could be completed in 10 to15 minutes and that all questions were clear andable to be translated into Somali. The survey was distributed by the front desk staff. Along with the survey, chocolates were givento all participants as a precompletion incentive.Interpreters were requested to help non-English-speaking participants complete the survey andwere also given the chocolate incentive to helpencourage their assistance. The study was ap-proved by the University of Minnesota Institu-tional Review Board. Data were summarized using descriptive statis- tics. Groups were compared using 2-tailed Fisherexact tests. Pvalues/H11021.05 were considered statisti- cally signicant, and no adjustments were made formultiple comparisons. Analysis was performed us-ing Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond,WA) and Epi Info 7 software (Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention, Atlanta, GA). Results DemographicsApproximately 200 surveys were distributed fromAugust 2012 through February 2013; 99 partici-pants returned completed surveys. The mean age ofparticipants was 33 years, and 83.3% (n /H1100580) were female (Table 1). Parents had an overall average of 3 children: Somali parents had a mean of 3.76 chil-dren (range, 1-9 children) and non-Somali parentshad 2.57 children (range, 1-12 children). Slightlymore than one third of participants (37.6%) had ahigh school education or less, and no signicant ed-ucational differences were found between Somali and non-Somali parents. Of participants, 58.8%were born in the United States. The participatingpatient population was fairly representative of theSmiley's Clinic patient demographics: 28.1% So-mali, 27.8% non-Hispanic white, 19.8% non- Table 1.

Downloaded from Somali black, 15.5% American Indian, 4.1% Asian, and 3% Hispanic. Vaccine Use Somali parents were more likely (22.2%) than non- Somali parents (5.8%) to refuse the (odds There was no signicant difference inthe refusal of any other recommended vaccines be-tween Somali and non-Somali parents (Table 2).When asked about reasons for refusing the vaccine,42.9% of Somali respondents who refused the vac-cine reported personally knowing someone whohad suffered adverse effects to the vaccine, and57.1% reported hearing about problems with thevaccine. None of the Somali parents indicated thatthey were concerned about the efcacy of or lack ofresearch into vaccines. Concern over \"vaccine overload\" is a commonly cited reason for parental refusal of vaccination. 7 When asked how many vaccines parents were com-fortable with their child receiving in one visit, only39.6% of parents reported being comfortable withwhatever number their physician recommended. So-mali parents were more likely to report being uncom-fortable with multiple vaccines during one visit (oddsratio, 4.0; 95% condence interval, 1.4 -11.9). Autism and Vaccines When asked whether they had heard about the ideathat vaccines could cause autism, 61.6% of partic-ipants (76.9% of Somalis and 55.0% of non-Soma-lis; P/H11005.06) indicated that they were aware of the theory. Interestingly, a variety of vaccines wereimplicated: 63.9% of parents indicated they hadheard of the MMR being blamed for mentioned. While both Somali and non-So-mali parents had heard of the idea, Somali parentswere signicantly more likely to believe that vac-cines cause autism (35% vs 8%; P/H11005.02). Frequent sources of the idea that vaccines cause autism werefriends (29 parents), the Internet (24 parents), andtelevision shows (22 parents). Slightly more than half of all parents reported knowing a child with autism. Six parents reportedhaving a child with autism, 3 of whom were Somali.Those who indicated that they believed vaccinescaused autism were then asked why they held thatbelief. All Somali parents reported that they heldthe belief because they knew a child who receivedthe MMR vaccine and then got autism, comparedwith 40.0% of non-Somali parents. In addition,40.0% of non-Somali parents who believed thatvaccines caused autism indicated they held the be-lief because community members told them that itis true, and 20% had done research on the topicthemselves and believed that science supports theconnection. Vaccines and Society Of the participants, 21 parents (21%)\u20147 of themfrom Somalia\u2014 had refused a vaccine for theirchild. Parents who had never refused a vaccine fortheir child were asked a series of questions regard-ing their decision to vaccinate. Somali parents wereless likely than non-Somalis to indicate approvingvaccination because of concern over their childbecoming ill (25.0% and 62.1%, respectively; P/H11005 .01) in the community (25.0%and 56.9%, respectively; P/H11005.02). Both groups were most likely to because they trustedtheir health care provider's judgment (45.0% ofSomali and 65.5% of non-Somali participants). Participants also were asked a series of Likert- response items regarding broad perceptions of vac-cination. The percentages of those who agreed orstrongly agreed with each statement are shown inTable 3. The majority of Somali and non-Somaliparents agreed/strongly agreed that vaccines are agood way to protect children from disease, thatvaccines are very safe, and that every child shouldreceive all recommended vaccines.

Downloaded from no proven link between autism and vaccines, that people should have the right to refuse vaccinesfor any reason, and that vaccines are given fordiseases that are not serious. Somali and non-Somali parents differed signicantly in their re-sponse to only 1 item: that children get too manyvaccines. Somali parents were signicantly morelikely to agree that children receive too manyvaccines (P /H11005.01): 65.4% agreed with this state- ment. However, 88.0% of Somali parents alsoagreed that every child should receive all recom-mended vaccines. Discussion Although most Somali respondents to our surveyagreed that childhood immunizations are safe andimportant to protect children from disease, 35% ofthem believe that autism is caused by the MMR vac-cine. Somali parents were 4 times more likely thannon-Somali parents to report knowing a child whoreceived the MMR vaccine and then was diagnosedwith autism. These same concerns about MMR andautism also were found in focus group studies withSomali parents in Sweden and the United King-dom. 5,6 It is known that the Somali community in Min- nesota believes that their children are more affectedby autism than the general public . 4A study con - ducted in 2008 by the Minnesota Department ofHealth concluded that preschool-aged Somali chil-dren were signicantly more likely than non-So-mali children to participate in the Minneapolispublic schools' autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-specic special education services. 8The difference in the prevalence of Somali and non-Somali chil-dren receiving services decreased markedly duringthe 3 years of study. The report provided no dataregarding the actual prevalence of ASD. The Uni-versity of Minnesota recently completed a study that determined that the prevalence of ASD amongSomali children in Minneapolis is not signicantlydifferent from that of white children, though bothSomali and white rates are higher than those ofother ethnic groups. 9 This study is consistent with reports that Somali parents are more likely than non-Somali parents torefuse the MMR vaccine for their child. Of Somaliparents, 22% indicated that they refused the vaccine.An internal review of 90 Smiley's Clinic charts con-ducted in 2011 indicated that 71% of Somali childrenaged 18 to 36 months received the MMR vaccinecompared with 94% of non-Somali children. 2011data from Hennepin County, where Minneapolis islocated, found that only 57% of Somali children bornin 2009 received the rst recommended MMR dosecompared with 85% of non-Somali children. 4While Somali children make up only a small proportion ofMinnesotan children overall, within the tight-knit So-mali community such low immunization coveragepresents a serious risk to \"herd immunity.\" Most ofthe measles cases in Hennepin County outbreak were among Somalis. 3Population cov - erage needs to be /H1102296% to prevent outbreaks of measles.10 Our survey results are limited by being a con- venience sample with a self-selection bias. Therewere a small number of non-English-speakingparticipants as well as a small overall sample size,which can lead to type 2 errors. With 6 parentsreporting having children with autism, many of these respondents clearly had strong opinions onthis topic. Despite these limitations, statisticallysignicant differences in perceptions about anduse of vaccines were able to be detected betweenSomali and non-Somali participants in the sur-vey.Table 3.

Downloaded from Future Directions The Minnesota Department of Health has in prog- ress several projects regarding autism and the Somalicommunity, in addition to the prevalence study men-tioned earlier. 8The department has written educa - tional materials about vaccinations and autism thatare available in the Somali language. Because manySomalis do not read either English or the writtenSomali language, the department website also haslinks to videos about vaccinations and autism in theSomali language with English subtitles. Although more Somali parents have concerns about MMR and the large number of vaccines,providers also have these conversations with con-cerned non-Somali parents. The Centers for Dis-ease Control and Prevention, the American Acad-emy of Family Physicians, and the AmericanAcademy of Pediatrics have partnered to develop\"Providers Resources for Vaccine Conversationswith Parents,\" which are available online (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/patient-ed/conversations/index.html). Written information for providers and parents and a video suitable for play in a waiting roomalso are available on the website. Future research shouldevaluate the effectiveness of these educational materialson improving vaccination rates.
