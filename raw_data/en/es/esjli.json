These vibrations affect us even though they may not visible on the eye and we may not be conscious of their existence. All matter is constantly exchanging vibration of different wavelengths. These vibrations affect us even though they may not visible on the eye and we may not be conscious of their existence. The part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which surrounds us and penetrates us represents our \"Aura\". The Aura is not just a halo around you but also an extension of your being - it is your mind. To understand a human being one also needs to understand the Aura of that being. The aura, also known as an enteric body is an important shield to our physical body. Aura is a Bio-electric magnetic field radiating from every human being, plants, animals, living and non-living, It's an energy emanating from every soul and matter.Brief history and development of Aura photography Human is curious to see this aura so that he can assess his physical health, as well as, spiritual powers. In the year 1939, a Russian technician named Simon KIRLIAN observed a light emitting from his fingers when exposed to the photographic plate working in a high voltage area. He developed the first camera known as Kirlian Camera to photograph this aura. After these many methods were developed GDV(Gas Discharge Visualisation) by Dr. Konstantin korotkov, Energy Scanning by Prof. Louies Rosche, PIP (Polycontrast Interference Photography) by Dr. Thornton Streeter, and the latest in this field is EFI (Energy Field Imaging) by Dr. John R Rogerson.Relationship of Aura with body, mind and spirit. Aura, the subtle energy shield, is often depicted as a halo in illustrations. Aura is an electromagnetic field around every living body. In human beings, it is a storehouse of all negative and positive energies. An energy body of auras has seven layers, each layer being related to each of the seven energy chakras or wheels located along the spine. The auras are also related to the seven colours of the rainbow and are influenced by sound vibrations. A healthy aura signifies healthy body, mind and spirit. Monitoring the changes in aura colours can help you in diagnosing ailments. Often, with the help of aura pictures, an illness can be detected much before the symptoms of the disease appear. You may even discover the emotional state and sense life's purpose. It is not easy to look at one's aura with the naked eye but the discovery of the Kirlian camera by a Russian scientist, SD Kirlian, has made it possible to take photographs of the aura. Clairvoyants can also discern the colours of the aura. Pure and shining colours in the aura indicate good health. Murky and dull colours reveal symptoms of impending illness. The aura's health can be maintained, for instance, by regular practice of yoga, meditation, Tai Chi, pranic healing, classical sound therapy of [Reiki](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/reiki) . It is important to keep the aura free from negative energies such as anger, worry, fear and such other emotions that disturb the normal functioning of physical, mental and emotional systems.Who is the brain behind the system? EFi BEISS & Photon Pro were wholly developed and manufactured by Energy Field Imaging by Dr John Rogerson with Mr Ravi Despande's team in India. BEISS & Photon Pro are licensed software programs, which run on Windows operating systems. EFi uses standardized digital and video camera technologies to reveal and capture subtle energy and biofields, together with a colour-decoding filter, which discerns light photons and energy. EFi systems are completely safe, non-invasive and record with standard CE approved equipment, which is licensed and registered. They measure and monitor individuals, healing modalities and other subject matter, and used as a complement to your medical physician's advice and not as a replacement; please request client's to consult a doctor if symptoms develop or persist. Scans are best taken under standard clinical parameters; on an empty stomach, no jewellery, with balanced controlled FSL, clean, shaven, in light cotton underwear and when relaxed. We do not make any claims as to what EFi is recording medically and it is not a diagnostic device but used as an assessment method.How can this system be helpful?

Traditional Vastu was related to orientation, climatology and structures. During Vedic era there was no electricity any overcrowding and no pollution. Living and working conditions were different. Now conditions have become altogether changed. Vertical structures have become reality. Lifestyle has changed a lot. Currently, use of wireless, cell phones, microwaves and Electro-magnetic use have become rampant. The Ancient Texts on Vastu need to be interpreted as per today's perspective. A building whose walls are parallel to cardinal directions is exposed to cosmic rays, which are in resonance with the magnetic field of the earth, and hence its inmates are happier than others. Unlike solar energy, cosmic energy can be stored in our chakras. The one who stores it more is more successful. Vastu is a get way to the storage of cosmic energy. All buildings have more or less Vastu defects. Demolition is not the answer. The beauty lies in removing the Vastu defects by balancing of five elements i.e. five forces of nature. Balancing can be done through modern methods of energy spirals, shielding and Aura frequencies. Other cures are through quartz crystals, Aromatic oils, minerals, grains, vegetables, conductors, insulators, colors, etc. Let us take an example of aromatic oil. If the North West of the building is not as per Vastu. It will affect circulator system of the body. Use of sandalwood oil will give relief. All these have given birth to Energy Vastu where assessment and rectification is possible with proof for all major structural problems without any demolition e.g, North East cut, South West low, South East water body, North East higher etc. two pictures one prior to rectification and other after remedial measures are enough to prove efficacy of Energy Vastu through Aura scanning. Geopathic stress is caused on account of non-compliance with the natural laws of harnessing the Cosmic Energy and Natural Energy in building our structures. These laws are also enshrined in the ancient science like Indian [Vastu Shastra](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/vastu-shastra) and Chinese Feng Shui for compliance and happy living. Persons living in energy-imbalanced house/structures are subject to various problems and a host of other undesirable happenings in life. Presence of Positive Energy in the working place is a primary requisite for the success of the business or any venture. The types of Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR) are related to each other by the rate at which each vibrates. The rate of vibration is termed frequency in cycles per second or Hertz. The Electromagnetic (EM) spectrum visually relates each type of radiation to the others by the frequency of vibration. These energies include: Those emanating from a building's electric power distribution system: AC [Alternating Current (60 cycles/second)] Electric field (Also called ELF electric fields) Ac Magnetic Fields (Also called ELF magnetic fields) Those associated with communications radiations [Radio Frequency (RF) Fields] and found in the air: These are produced by information carrying radio waves such as: Cordless telephones Bluetooth Cell phones Broadcast TV and Digital Broadcast TV Pagers AM and PM radio Wireless Internet Emergency and military communications Scientifically, it is a proven fact that each object has an intrinsic composition of energy, which keeps on coinciding with the Aura of the other one. An individual gets affects by theses Auras that are scientifically termed as electromagnetic radiations. These electromagnetic radiations are continuously emanating from the buildings, objects, equipments, appliances and machineries constituting the surrounding of a person. These radiations affect the overall existence of an individual in terms of his health concentration power, efficiency and performance. Even the power working of machinery or an appliance and its work output can be traced back to these radiations. Good energy flow through North West Main Entry [Negative energy](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/negative-energy) in toilet Negative energies in stores due to EMR On a research study, it was observed by Dr John Rogerson and his team that EFi discerns clear differences between 'scared and protected sites' associated with harmonious surroundings and wellbeing and those which are affected by various forms of pollution which can impact individual's health. Observe Scan One, a picture of an Indian shrine/temple area and Scan Two of the modern office with computer and electrical systems. There is a clear and vast difference is waveforms and colours which the eye alone is unable to detect. These low energy waves are harmful whilst the clear high frequencies found in the temple are balanced. "}
