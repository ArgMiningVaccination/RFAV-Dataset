My clinical practice is devoted to the comprehensive care of adults and children living with multiple sclerosis (MS) and other demyelinating disorders. I direct the Jacobs Multiple Sclerosis Center for Treatment and Research at UBMD Neurology; our clinic offers state-of-the-art diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for MS patients and for patients with other autoimmune diseases affecting the central nervous system. We provide a full spectrum of support services to patients including, but not limited to neurocognitive assessment, physical and occupational therapy and social work services that help both patients and families. Additionally, I serve on hospital inpatient service several times a year. I also direct the Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis Center of Buffalo, one of the initial six centers of excellence established by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. In addition, I serve as executive director of the New York State Multiple Sclerosis Consortium (NYSMSC), one of the largest MS registries in the nation. In support of my patients, I speak to patient and family groups about our MS research and emerging therapies. My team members and I offer special patient programs where we discuss topics such as MS therapies as well as the importance of exercise, nutrition, healthy lifestyle and more specific issues such as reproduction, osteoporosis and aging. My research interests are aimed at better understanding the heterogeneity of MS, identifying predictors of disease progression with a primary focus on genetic and environmental interactions and influences on MS disease phenotype. I am also interested in response to therapy, e.g., influences on physical and neurocognitive status. Pediatric MS, an insufficiently explored subject, is an important area of my clinical and research interests. More recent foci of my research include understanding the cholesterol link to MS and its influence on the pathobiology of MS, bone health and exercise programs for patients with MS and aging: patient characteristics and biomarkers associated with, and predictive of improved quality of life and/or MS disease stabilization in MS aging. I lecture students and residents on a regular basis. I also mentor five to seven pre-residency candidates and fourth-year medical students per year in clinical rotations and in research project design and implementation.
