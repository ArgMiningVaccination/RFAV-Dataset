Let There Be Light Acknowledgments Notes Index About the Author Copyright About the Publisher Introduction In the 1840s, puerperal fever, or childbed fever, a postpartum bacterial uterine infection, swept through one of two maternity clinics at the Vienna General Hospital in Austria. At the first clinic, the mortality rate among women giving birth was 10 percent; in the other, it was less than 4 percent. The two clinics admitted patients on alternate days. When women learned they'd gone into labor on a day reserved for the clinic rife with childbed fever, they would often drop to their knees, begging not to be admitted. Some women went so far as to stall long enough to give birth outside. These women\u2014who'd given street births as this practice came to be known\u2014remained eligible for child-care benefits, even without having to be admitted to the clinic. And, as it was later discovered, they also rarely contracted the childbed fever that was raging inside. Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian doctor who'd recently begun working at the first clinic, wondered what protected these women from such a highly contagious infection. After all, both clinics used almost all of the same techniques. The only difference: medical students worked in the first clinic whereas midwives worked in the second. After a meticulous process of elimination, Semmelweis concluded that he and the medical students carried cadaverous particles on their hands, whereas the midwives, who did not perform autopsies and had no contact with corpses, kept their hands free of such contamination. (As for the women who'd had street births, they'd managed to avoid infection by not having medical oversight during childbirth at all.) Semmelweis subsequently ordered that doctors at the first clinic wash their hands with chlorinated lime water after performing autopsies and before examining patients. After the practice was instituted, the mortality rate at the first clinic dropped by an astounding 90 percent. Semmelweis then ordered the midwives at the second clinic to do the same\u2014in addition to scrubbing their instruments in a chlorine solution. Again, this dramatically reduced the hospital's death rate. Yet, despite clear evidence that Semmelweis's theory and practice saved lives, his colleagues, clinging to their well-established beliefs, refused to concede that these results were anything more than coincidence. After all, they couldn't see the cause of death: the microscopic bacteria. And, more important, Semmelweis's data didn't correspond with how they believed the body operated. The germ theory of disease had not yet been accepted in Vienna; diseases were attributed, at that time, to a variety of different and unrelated causes. Semmelweis's colleagues ridiculed him and eventually stopped following his guidelines. Soon after, Semmelweis lost his job. He spent the rest of his life fighting the medical community on this issue of sterilization and cleanliness, and at age forty-seven, this innovative thinker was committed to a mental asylum, where he died from sepsis. The foundations of energy medicine are as ancient as history. In Egypt, a description of the laying on of hands, as a prompt to the body to relieve pain, was found in the Ebers Papyrus, one of the oldest preserved medical documents, dated 1550 BC. Pythagoras, the Greek philosopher and physician, considered healing his greatest calling and considered the pneuma, literally meaning breath, to be the spirit. In Ayurveda, a health system developed thousands of years ago in India, the life-giving force is referred to as prana; in Judeo-Christian belief systems, it is called the breath of life. And in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which is what I have practiced for twenty years, the animating force that plays an essential role in maintaining and restoring health is called qi. In this way, spirituality, philosophy, and science were once intertwined, making up an essential part of our history, but we have since strayed considerably from this notion. I often wonder if one day we'll look back on energy healing and shake our heads in disbelief, as we do with the story of Semmelweis, wondering why any of us resisted an approach that offers such benefits simply because it didn't fit into our prevailing medical model. And yet I admit: I, myself, took my time in coming around to this view. My career began with an instinct to help others; it was as broad and naive as that. But as my work took form\u2014after studying East Asian medicine in graduate school, I practiced acupuncture in hospice before starting my own practice in New York City\u2014I came to recognize the profoundly interwoven nature of healing. From the start, in my work as an acupuncturist, I was both humbled and intrigued by the way patients thrived under my care. It bolstered my faith that this ancient practice\u2014administering thin needles to affect the flow of energy within the body\u2014offered such effective results. It also, however, raised a number of startling questions. Most essentially: Why was it that this manipulation of energy was so beneficial? Was I simply acting as a placebo? Or was I some kind of conduit, as I sometimes curiously felt, with energy coming through me when I worked? Chinese philosophy posits that a vital energy, what is called qi, surrounds and courses through our bodies to support life. It holds the body's innate intelligence, the intangible yet measurable way we maintain what's known as homeostasis, or the body's ability to regulate its internal environment to create good health. But qi is also understood to be part of a larger pattern, a grand energy field, through which we are all interrelated. As I became more adept at my work, I had the sense that something I couldn't see was influencing what was happening\u2014not unlike, perhaps, the intuition Dr. Semmelweis felt in his clinic. I suspected that the needles and herbs (which I prescribe to supplement the acupuncture) were only part of what was helping my patients. And, increasingly, I felt an undeniable sensation when I practiced. Physically, it felt as if someone were pouring tonic water down my spine; mentally, it came across as an acute instinct that I was drawing energy from outside and channeling it for my patients. I was captivated by this notion, but I was also afraid of it, impatient with it, wary of its validity. I was conscious of, and self-conscious about, the energy healing field being rife with\u2014to put a fine point on it\u2014quackery. While TCM practitioners like me are licensed and held to a specific standard both medically and ethically, there are no minimum standards for most other types of energy work, which makes this a precarious landscape to enter, with fellow practitioners who can hang a shingle and ask clients to simply have faith in what they do. The last thing I wanted to give people\u2014including myself\u2014was false hope. I never want to overpromise or underdeliver. (My policy, I should also say, has always been to recommend, and in some instances require, that my patients confer with the appropriate medical doctors in conjunction with my treatments.) But I also had the strong impulse to further explore this ancient medical system that sought to unify the physical and the energetic and to understand it within the worlds of science and spirituality and philosophy today. As someone who methodically charts her own progress, I wasn't able to just accept that an enigmatic mix of needles and invisible energy fields served my patients so well. I wanted to know why. I also fervently wanted to explain me to me. So I pursued a variety of knowledgeable and dynamic specialists\u2014healers, academics, doctors, scientists, and researchers on the cutting edge of energy medicine\u2014and I found that they were all working from remarkably, and reassuringly, similar and interconnecting theories. Moving from the scientific to the mystical and back again, this book has been both a deeply personal project and a professional inquiry. It is as important for me to take an unflinching look at what I may be experiencing as a healer as it is to measure the changes that arise from energy interventions, and to validate them with evidence-based research. As such, over the last few years, I've studied the research of the former dean of engineering at Princeton University Robert Jahn, cofounder of the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research (PEAR) lab, which developed its own experimental agenda for investigating collective consciousness and its effects on us. I was counseled on spirituality and healing by Neale Donald Walsch, the bestselling author of the series Conversations with God. In Japan I visited the healer Hiroyuki Abe, who applies energy to acupuncture points\u2014without using needles. I asked a psychophysiologist to measure what happens in my body when I'm working with a patient, published research on energy medicine in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine, and consulted a British MD with an interesting take on how the acupuncture meridians work. I also spent time with William Bengston, PhD, author of The Energy Cure: Unraveling the Mystery of Hands-On Healing, who is both a healer and a scientist. Dr. Bengston trained a team of skeptical colleagues to use hands-on healing with lab mice who had been given injections that induced mammary cancer. The result? Dr. Bengston and his teams cured the mice time and again, in every experiment. This book is an account of what I've come to know about the most dependable and impressive means of harnessing healing energy and how we can all make this powerful force work for us. I hope that readers will not only come away with an understanding of what healing energy is, but genuinely trust it and feel encouraged to explore their own needs in a more informed way. And, as I believe everyone has an innate ability to tap into healing energy within themselves and in the world around them, I have included exercises throughout the book to help readers draw on their own capacities. While Chinese medicine will always be my foundation and focus, the work I do now is very different from when I first began my career\u2014it is the result of various disciplines that span many cultures and belief systems. And, as I'd hoped, my patients are better for it. More unexpectedly, however, this search has allowed me an unwavering faith that what cannot be explained, the bit of mystery that will always lie just out of reach, may be attuned to our needs. 1 At My Fingertips The first acupuncture patient I ever worked with on my own was a woman who had broken both of her legs. She had visited a fire station with her women's group and had been encouraged, ill-advisedly as it turned out, to slide down the fire pole. When I met her, she was still walking with two canes\u2014a full year after her accident. I was just beginning my third year of a four-year master's degree in acupuncture and Chinese medicine in San Diego, California, and a long way from my native Britain. Before treating this woman, I'd only ever performed acupuncture on a patient as an assistant to a more senior student; before that, I'd practiced on sewn bags of rice. This was my first day working as an acupuncturist and herbalist in the school's clinic, and though I did have a supervisor, he was also watching a number of other students, all of us practicing acupuncture unaccompanied for the first time. In the treatment room, the woman looked at me expectantly and handed over a set of X-rays from her doctor. I held them up to the light and tried to at least appear confident as I attempted to decipher what exactly I was viewing. At that moment my supervisor popped his head around the door to check on me; he strode across the room to turn the X-rays right side up in my hands. Just do a basic treatment, he told me quietly. I forged ahead. I asked the woman to put on a gown and lie down on the small table. When she was ready, I dutifully began putting needles in a selection of basic acupuncture points to address her pain. The woman was completely still and silent throughout. Honestly, I had no sense as to whether anything I was doing was having any effect at all. The session seemed rather unremarkable\u2014disappointingly so\u2014until the end. What happened next will sound too good to be true, but bear with me: the point of this story is that it is easy to attribute recoveries we don't understand to the miraculous when, in fact, they are really just recoveries we don't understand. After I had removed the last needle and whispered a quiet Thank you to indicate the treatment was over, the woman opened her eyes and said, That felt amazing! She sat upright from the table and declared, I'm going to try walking without my canes. And that she did. She walked slowly round the room. I felt as if we were on a daytime talk show, the whole thing felt so surreal. I briefly wondered if this was some kind of test or prank that the teachers pulled on all first-timers. But there she was, this woman who'd hobbled in only an hour ago, strolling out of the office. She even left her canes behind, propped up against the wall. I carried them out to the parking lot, where she was getting into her car. When I caught up to her, she offered me a curt and practical thank-you; I suppose she'd expected this much from an acupuncture session. I handed her the canes, my head still spinning, and thanked her back. What on earth did you do? asked my supervisor when I returned. I had no idea. But it was immediately clear to me that, tempting as it was, I couldn't take credit. For a start, I wasn't sure that the patient's sudden impulse to walk, although dramatic, was all that miraculous. After a year of using canes, there was bound to come a time when she felt confident enough to discard them. Perhaps the acupuncture had given her sufficient pain relief that she felt as if this was the right day to try. It was also possible I'd played the role of a placebo, offering the psychological reassurance this woman needed to get up on her feet (quite literally). Regardless, this experience was a pivotal one because it made me see that people can heal in astonishing ways. And I felt for the first time how deeply gratifying it is to guide people toward better health\u2014even if I'm not entirely clear on how the healing has taken place. I felt not only a profound sense of purpose when I helped to relieve my patient's suffering but also a sense of inevitability\u2014or, put more dramatically, fate. I knew on that day that this was what I was meant to do. This woman with the two broken legs and her striking response to treatment\u2014be it the consequence of acupuncture or placebo or a more expansive energy or, as I now believe, some combination of the three\u2014set me on a path. I began to understand with more nuance and depth that healing isn't magic, but rather a complicated interplay between circumstance, skill, and the body's own energy field, or what the Chinese refer to as qi. The Chinese were not alone in identifying an animating force that plays an essential role in maintaining and restoring good health. In fact, most major cultural traditions identify a vital energy that governs physical and mental processes and provides all living beings with a blueprint for health and abundance. What these ancient traditions observed more generally is that life has two aspects: matter and energy. They viewed the body as matter and identified its vital force\u2014variously called pneuma, prana, or breath\u2014as energy. Of course, philosophers and Western scientists, too, are not strangers to the quest to understand what animates us. The Greek philosopher Aristotle actually coined the term \"en\u00e9rgeia,\" which is Greek for energy, though it doesn't directly translate in English. Aristotle, himself, found it difficult to define what he meant by the word, as he used it to convey a variety of ideas, one of which is related to intention,\u00b9 a desire to make manifest the decisions of the mind. In the seventeenth century, energy was first used in English to refer to power, and in the nineteenth century it took on its more scientific meaning as a property that must be transferred to an object to perform work or to generate heat. In 1905, Albert Einstein offered a new way of looking at the relationship between energy and matter when he published a paper containing the famous equation E=MC\u00b2\u2014E being, of course, energy, M being mass (which is how we measure matter), and C\u00b2, from the Latin word \"celeritas, meaning quickness,\" referring to the speed of light. Scientists had considered energy to be a property of matter before this, but Einstein's theory proposed that matter and energy are interrelated and that simply by having mass, matter possesses an inherent amount of energy. In those rare instances in which matter is totally converted into energy, Einstein's equation helps us calculate how much energy will be produced. The idea that matter can be turned into energy may sound esoteric, but it's a principle with which we are all familiar. It's what happens when we burn wood in order to generate heat. It led to the development of the atomic bomb. But is the reverse true? Is matter simply energy condensed? The Big Bang would suggest that it is; this theory has energy converting into matter as the universe came into being. However, this is very challenging to prove in a practical way thanks to the C\u00b2 part of Einstein's equation\u2014the speed of light squared. Creating enough velocity\u2014and consequently enough energy\u2014to re-create such a phenomenon was considered an impossible task. Until, that is, in 2012, when scientists at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (known as CERN, for Conseil Europ\u00e9enne pour la Recherche Nucl\u00e9aire), the laboratory for particle physics near Geneva, were able to successfully create the Higgs particle, sometimes referred to as the God particle.\u00b2 In order to do this, two particles\u2014traveling an almost seventeen-mile ring from opposite directions\u2014were collided at fantastically high energies. This collision took place in CERN's Large Hadron Collider\u2014the world's most powerful particle accelerator\u2014which took thirty years to build, cost $6.4 billion, and literally spans two countries (in order to get around it, scientists bike its perimeters, which stretch between France and Switzerland). The creation of the Higgs particle was a tremendous success; however, it came with a caveat: the experiment had required a small amount of matter to initiate the process, which meant that it hadn't conclusively established that energy can be converted into matter. Until 2014, that is, when a group of physicists from Imperial College London and Germany's Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics offered an elegant solution.\u00b3 They proved mathematically that two light particles (known as photons) could be collided to create matter. According to the Judeo-Christian belief system, on the first day of creation, God said, Let there be light. In this way, when transforming pure energy into matter, science, as it turns out, is aligned with spirituality. The Taoist version of the creation story, as it is known in Chinese philosophy, begins with nothingness, from which duality arises. This duality\u2014held within the idea of qi or life energy\u2014is composed of opposing, but interconnected, concepts: yin and yang. One cannot exist without the other. They complement each other in the world, forming a whole. Cold is yin and would not exist without comparison to heat, which is yang. Daytime belongs to yang; nighttime is yin. However, in medicine, yin refers to matter or, more specifically, the body\u2014our bones, organs, muscles, blood vessels. Yang describes our circulating life force, or, as I think of it, our body's intelligence. Yin and Yang are in dynamic balance within us. Yin can turn into yang; yang can turn "}
