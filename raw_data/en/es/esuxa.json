The pandemic has had an impact on nearly every system of our body. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave immediate authorization of several vaccines to avoid critical COVID-19 outcomes following the rapid spread of the COVID-19. There have only been a few cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination-induced immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) so far. There should be enough information to identify whether some vaccination adverse effects, such as ITP, are caused by the vaccine. This study aims to determine how common ITP occurs after receiving the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, as well as gender, age, symptoms, biomarkers, predicted outcomes, and sequelae. We looked at a number of research and compiled the best evidence of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia currently available. To find the recommended reporting items, the search technique included keywords like \"Immune thrombocytopenia,\" \"COVID-19,\" \"SARS-CoV-2,\" and \"Vaccination.\" The search results were grouped using Boolean operators (\"OR,\" \"AND\").", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2022-07-01", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
