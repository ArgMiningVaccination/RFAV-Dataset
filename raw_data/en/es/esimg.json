Drinking delicious organic cacao combined with receiving sound healing therapy will fully anchor in the healing energies and integrate any deep inner work that takes place. This healing session will begin with a sacred Cacao ceremony lovingly facilitated by Seven Faith. Cacao has many health benefits including promoting healthy brain and heart functioning, improving blood flow, helps boost immune system and mood. Cacao also has anti-aging properties and improves sleep quality. This sacred drink is also high in antioxidants and essential minerals that boost vitality in the body. On a spiritual level, Cacao is a powerful plant medicine that has been used for thousands of years in healing/holy/sacred ceremonies. It helps to strengthen the connection to our own divine guidance and to our ancestors/spiritual team. Drinking/ingesting Cacao expands the Heart Chakra, creates clarity and purification within, deepens our empathy and connection to Self, others and the Earth/Mother Gaia. This sacred chocolate opens you up to your intuition and creativity, centers you, and enhances your spiritual connection especially when meditating. Then Seven will walk you through a journaling intention setting manifestation and release process to set your healing intentions for your Sound Bath experience. Once your intentions are set, Seven will begin the Sound Bath where singing bowls are played to wash over your entire being a sense of calm tranquility and relaxation. The bowls are specifically tuned to sacred frequencies which cleanse, clear, activate and balance your chakras. The vibrations balance your mind, body and spirit on the cellular, molecular and energetic level. Divine Spark uses a variety of sacred sound instruments including singing bowls made from quartz crystal, metal Himalayan bowls, a Crystal Merkaba, a Crystal Pyramid, tingshas, native drums and rattle. Your ceremony facilitator, Seven will also intuitively connect and channel Light Language to create a deeply profound healing experience.
