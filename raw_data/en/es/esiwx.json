Executive Summary Diagnostic technologies for dengue fever, a positive -strand RNA viral , mosquito -born, acute febrile disease spreading throughout tropical regions of the world, are critical for effective management and early treatment of this emerging global health threat . Research and development of diagnostic tec hnologies has progressed from standard serological assays and procedures to immunological/antibody tests, DNA amplification techniques and recently towards more advanced and sophisticated biotechnological applications and innovations. Whereas, these techn ologies will likely be essential for management of dengue fever, they also are, for the most part, protected by intellectual property rights (patents) . This report focuses on patent landscape analysis of dengue diagnostic technologies such as : ELISA, Po lymerase Chain Reactions, NS1 assays, Luminescence -based optical fiber biosensors, absorption spectroscopy, and emerging technologies that have the potential to be a dengue diagnostic. The purpose of this patent landscape study was to search, identify and categorize patent documents that are relevant to diagnostic tools, research and development for dengue fever , and thereby provide a preliminary survey of the global status of patenting activity in the dengue diagnostic space . Figure I. Global patenting activity in the dengue diagnostic space . Documents (patent data) used to generate this map include both patent applications and granted patents , derived from INPADOC families of the coded (relevant and emerging technologies) patent documents. 4 In the course of the patent search and analysis phase, 3,725 patent documents were initially identified for subsequent analysis. Of these, 133 patent documents were found to be relevant technologies. (A patent document was considered to be relevant base d on two requirements. First, the document had to specifically claim either diagnosing d engue or a Flavivirus (Flaviviridae ). Second, the patent had to claim a diagnostic kit, a method of diagnosis, a composition of a kit, or a combination thereof. ) Additionally, 157 patent documents were classified as emerging technology . (A patent was considered as emerging technology, if it claim ed a method of diagnosis of a virus, a kit composition of a virus, or a diagnostic kit of a virus. Further, patents that did not have dengue or Flavivirus in the claims, but did mention dengue or Flavivirus in the abstract or description were considered eme rging technology.) Figure II. Filing date of patent documents in various jurisdictions (including WIPO/PCT and EPO) over 17 years . Patent filing increases in an exponential manner from 1992 in US and WIPO, with a steady increase in all jurisdictions since 2005; global patent ing of dengue diagnostics technologies appears to be increasing. Results suggest that, in the deng ue diagnostic technology space, there is a trend towards greater patenting activity across the world, both in the industrialized north (US, Japan and Europe) and in developing countries (Russia, India, China, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa). This further suggests that patentees increasingly consider developing countries as viable commercial markets for distribution and utilization of technologies for the treatment and diagnosis of tropical diseases endemic to these regions. 5 Figure 1: Dengue v irus4 Figure 2: Aedes Aegypti - dengue carrying mosquito5 Figure 3: Dengue ELISA diagnostic plate6 III. Scope of Technology Analyzed Dengue Diagnostics 4 5 6 New diagnostic technologies are being exp lored that diagnose dengue fever . This mosquito born disease is gaining more recognition as it spreads out of the tropical regions and has the potential of becoming a worldwide disease. While a treatable disease however; appropriate treatment is based on proper diagnosis of a dengue infection. Research has progressed toward developing diagnostic tools that are inexpensive to create, have ease of use in the field where there may be poor medical facilities, are reliable in detecting the different variation s of the dengue virus, and are more sensitive for earlier detection. This report focuses on diagnostic technologies including: ELISA, Polymerase Chain Reactions, NS1 assays, Luminescence -based optical fiber biosensors, absorption spectroscopy, and emergin g technologies that have the potential to be a dengue diagnostic. The purpose of this patent landscape study was to search, identify and categorize patent documents that are relevant to diagnostic tools, research and development for dengue fever . 4 MicrobiologyBytes, Flaviviruses (April 5 G.

Discla imer This is an educational report and is neither inclusive nor comprehensive . Rather, it is an informational resource to facilitate a better understanding of the international patent literature landscape with regard to the diagnostic means applicable t o the dengue virus. This report is not a list of all potentially relevant patents . It is not a Freedom to Operate (FTO) opinion, but instead constitutes an educational analysis of potentially relevant material. While the search engines utilized in this project are extensive, it is likely that the entire spectrum of patents was not obtained utilizing the various search strategies and methods articulated herein . Therefore, it is not the supposition of this team that all relevant patents were discovered du ring the creation of this report. As the team members are not experts in the field of diagnosing the dengue virus, it is highly possible that the categorization of the patents found and coded are incomplete . The team cannot guarantee that the patents dis covered were evaluated at the level of expert scientific sophistication. The limited time frame (15 weeks), the overall semester demands, and the general press of business dictated the number of patents evaluated . As such, additional patents may have be en available for evaluation but without the necessary time within which to consider them they may not have been considered. Again, this report is not a Freedom to Operate (FTO) opinion . It is an educational report. 7 V.

About the Technology Introduction Dengue fever , part of the Flaviviridae family, is a mosquito born infection that is steadily becoming a growin g international public concern . Typically, dengue is mostly found in tropical and sub -tropical region around the world . These locations range from India to the South America. (See Fig. 3) With the aspect of global warming, many expect the presence of dengue fever to slowly spread throughout the world.7 8 As the risk of dengue fever continues to spread the global effect has grown significantly in recent years . Currently, around 100 countries have dengue as an epidemic when there were only 9 countries that reported dengue in the 1970's . Dengue c ases reported in various countries have been increasing steadily over the past few years . (See Fig. 7) The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there may be 50 million cases of dengue infection worldwide every year. (See Fig. 5 and Fig. 6) Some 2500 million people are at risk for dengue fever ; this would make up two - fifths of the world population . In 1998 alone, there were 616,000 reported cases of dengue in both Americas and 11,000 of these case s were dengue hemorrhagic fever.9 7 Sathyamangalam Swaminathan & Navin Khanna, Dengue: Recent Advances in Biology and Current Status of Translational Research , 9 CURRENT MOLECULAR MED. 152 (2009). 8 Id. at 153. 9 Sustainable Development Networking Programme, Dengue the Deadly Killer , http://www.sdnbd.org/dengue_fever.htm. Figure 4: Dengue risk areas around the w orld8 9 1011 12 Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), discovered in 1950's, is a potentially deadly complication which develops from a prolonged infection of dengue fever . Currently, this complication is becoming the leading cause of child mortality in several Asian countries . There are four distinct but closely related viruses that cause dengue : DEN -1, DEN -2, DEN -3, DEN -4 are all serotypes 10 Journal of Environmental Health Research, Distribution pattern of a dengue fever outbreak using GIS (2009), http://www.cieh.org/jehr/distribution_pattern_dengue_fever.html. 11 World Health Organization, Impact of Dengue , http://www.who.int/csr/disease/dengue/impact/en/index.html. 12 CDC Emerging Infectious Diseases, Dengue and Fever, Brazil, 1981 -2002 (Jan. 2005), http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/Eid/vol11no01/03 -1091 -G2.htm. Figure 5: Dengue cases reported in Malaysia for years 2000 - 2005.10 Dengue Cases Rep orted in Malaysia Figure 6: Dengue cases r eported to WHO for the years 1995 -2007.11 Figure 7: WHO reported cases on DHF deaths12 Reported Dengue Cases and Hospitalizations 10 that cause dengue fever . Interestingly, providing immunity to one serotype lowers the resistance and sequential infection to the other serotypes resulting in DHF. During dengue epidemics, around 40 - 50% are susceptible to dengue fever , but this value may reach 80 - 90% when the provided with immunity to one serotype.13 1.A Transmission o f Dengue Fever Dengue fever is transmitted to human most effectively by the Aedas aegypti mosquito but the A. albopictus and A. polynesiensis are also involved in a dengue outbreak . (See Fig. 8 ) Currently, 2.5 billion people live in areas where the d engue virus and its mosquito vectors are present . The mosquito generally acquires the virus by feeding on the blood of infected human . Once the mosquito feeds on an infected individual the mosquito is capable of transmitting the virus for the rest of its life. Interestingly, a female infected mosquito is also able to transmit the virus to its offspring but the method the virus would be transmitted to the humans from an infected offspring has not been determined . Since the human can have the virus for tw o to seven days, the Aedas Mosquito is able to acquire the virus when they feed on a human during this time.1415 The WHO noticed that several factors would greatly increase the global resurgence of dengue: failure to control the Aedes population, increas ed airplane travel to dengue epidemic areas, uncontrolled urbanization, unprecedented climate growth and global climate warming . Hence Rainfall and temperature which affect patterns of mosquitoes feeding and reproduction are major factors on the locations and susceptibility of the dengue fever .16 13 Sustainable Development Networking Programme, supra note 9. 14 Swaminathan, supra note 7. Parasitologia, 16 Swaminathan, supra the Aedes Aegypti m osquito15 11 1.B. The Dengue Virus and its Life Cycle The structure of Den -2 virion is shown on the Front page of the report and in Fig. 9. The virion is composed of an envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins, a lipid bilayer and an inner nucleocapsid (NC) core . The NC core contains a capsid (C)17 protein which will complex to the genome. The dengue Virus shares many characteristics as the other Flavivirus es in that it is a single stranded RNA genome that is packaged by the C protein in a lipid bilayer surrounded by glycoproteins.18 The life cycle of the dengue typically can be summarized in 5 stages: Entry into Permissive Cells; Translation of the Viral Genome; Genomic RNA Synthesis; Matu ration; and Release . (See Fig . 10) These stages are common to many Flavivirus infections . The dengue virus also converts from an immature virus, which is inactive to an active mature virus after these stages . (See Fig. 9)1920 1.B.1 Entry into Cells Stage The Entry into Permissive Cells stage is when the virus incorporates with target cells through endocytosis . These target cells could be human dendritic cells (DCs), monocytes/macrophages, endothelial cells, B cells, T cells, hepatocytes and neuronal cells . Based on clinical stud ies on dengue infected patients, mononuclear phagocytic lineage such as monocytes, macrophages and DCs are typically infected in vivo by the dengue virus.21 The identification of these DEN virus receptors on these cells have been in much investigation . The DC -Specific Intercellular adhesion molecule 3 Grabbing Nonintegrin (DC -SIGN) is one of the well -characterized molecules that interact with glycerin molecules on the dengue virus E protein . The Aedes Mosquitoes secretes a high mannose glycan which adds E protein residue, N67, which is critical for DC -SIGN mediated viral entry of any of the four serotypes.22 17 Swaminathan, supra note 7, at 154. 18 Id. at 153. 19 Id. at 154. 20 Id. at 155. 21 Id. 22 Id. Figure 10: Diagram showing the life c ycle of dengue fever19 Figure 9: (a) 3d model of DEN -2 mature virion (b) 3d model of DEN -2 immature virion17 12 1.B.2 Translation of the Virus Genome Once the virus is inside the permissive cell the translation of the virus genome begins . The RNA genome serv es as a template for both the replication and translation . This process is typical with other Flaviviridae in that the events occur with the association with membranous structures . Translation precedes replication upon the entry of the virus into the per missive cell because the virus encodes replicative proteins in its genome but does not package them in the virions. The virus RNA will be translated into a single polyprotein, which is processed cotranslationally and post-translationally by both the host and viral proteases.23 1.B.3 Genome RNA Synthesis When translation of the virus g enome is completed, the genome RNA becomes available as a template for replication . The mechanism from which the viral RNA switches from protein to RNA synthesis is unknow n. Viral RNA synthesis in flaviviradae infected cells is generally regarded to be cytoplasmic and occurs in the intracellular membranes . This is a vital aspect of viral RNA synthesis because of the important implications for disease pathogenesis, and hen ce the possible stage for creating vaccines and antiviral drug development is the ideally the translation stage. During this stage, the immature dengue virion assembles on the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) after the budding of the structural p roteins and synthesized RNA bud to into the lumen of ER. Interestingly, the resultant virion contains the essential components for maturation: E protein, pRM, lipid membranes, and NC . However, these particles cannot induce host -cell fusion and remain non -infectious because the prM protein needs to be further processed . Other sub -viral particles are also produced in the ER but these cells lack the C protein and the genomic RNA and only contain glycoproteins and membrane proteins so they too remain non -infection.24 1.B.4 Maturation / Release The m aturation process will begin when both the non -infectious dengue viral and sub -viral particles are transported to the trans -golgi network (TGN) . In the TGN, the particles are then cleaved by the host proteases , resulting in a mature infection virion . Both the non -infectious dengue viral and the sub -viral particles are cleaved by the host proteases and are released by exocytosis.25 1.C Symptoms of Dengue Fever Due to the four serotypes of the dengue v irion , there is a range of sympt oms that are possible with the d engue virion . The range can go from a simple fever or malaise to fatal encephalitis and DHF . Typically, the dengue symptoms grow as the fever progresses . For instance, during a primary infection one might expect to see a sudden onset of fever for 3 to 5 days accompanied with headache, myalgia, arthralgia or muscular pain, retro -orbital pain, anorexia and fine 23 Id. 24 Id. 25 Id. 13 muclopapular rash on extremities . These symptoms are more likely to be milder in childr en than adults.262728 The secondary infection of the disease results in over 90% of the infected cases having either or both DHF and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) . These patients were already infected with the primary infection and their symptoms are ver y similar to the primary infection . Although very similar to the primary infection it is after 3 to 7 days of the secondary infection that the patients begin to display haemorrhagic symptoms such as bleeding internally, particularly in the skin, gums and nasal region . These internal bleedings result in the leakage of plasma into extravascular spaces which cause the hypovolaemia haemorrhagic symptoms to reduce blood pressure and have serious vascular changes which result in coagulopathy, circulatory shock, vomiting and abdominal pain . Furthermore, lymphadenopathy and hepatomegaly also may occur in the presence of blood in stools, vomitus, and urine.29 Dengue Fever and Virus Diagnosis In the early stages of infection, isolation and identification o f dengue virus is traditionally the only way to diagnose a current dengue infection . In this technique, serum from patients is applied to mosquito cell lines . After amplification of the virus in infected cells, the serotype is identified using monoclonal antibod ies specific to each dengue serotype . This technique is only sensitive when there is a relatively high level of infectious particles in the serum . Dengue viraemia is short, typically starting 2 or 3 days before the onset of fever and lasting until day 4 or 5 of illness . Serum is the sample of choice for routine diagnosis by virus detection, although dengue virus can also be detected in plasma, leukocytes and in some tissues obtained at autopsy.30 at 155. 28 SOS-Arsenic.net, Dengue menace lurking in the wings (Sept. 3, 2006), http://www.sos - arsenic.net/english/environment/dengu.html 29 Id. 30 Philippe Buchy et al., Laboratory Tests for the Diagnosis of Dengue Virus Infection , Scientific working group report on dengu e meeting report (Oct. 1 -5, 2006). Figure 11: Symptoms of Dengue Fever26 Figure 12: Internal Bleeding within the Eye during a Dengue Infection28 14 Figure 1 3: splendens , Tx. amboinensis ) is the most sensitive system for the isolation of dengue virus, but because of the particular technical skill and special containment facilities required for direct inoculation of mosquitoes, cell culture is preferable for routine diagnosis . The mosquito cell line C6/36 (clone obtained from Ae. albopictus ) has become the host cell of choice for routine isolation of dengue virus, although the Ae. pseudoscutellaris cell line AP61 has also been used successfully . Mammalian cell cultures such as Vero cells, LLCMK2 and others have also been employed, with less efficiency. Identification of the dengue virus is generally accomplished using immunofluorescence techniques with serotype -specific monoclonal anti-dengue antibodies on mosquito head squashes or infected cells . Some strains are not easily identified because of a low concentration of virus . Plaque assay is the gold standard methodology for the quantification of dengue virus . Flow cytometry has recently been reported as a useful method for the identification of dengue virus 1 (DEN -1), and allows the virus to be identified 10 hours earlier than with an immunofluorescence assay, (RIA) was first described by Yalow and Berson in 1959, a discovery for which they won the 1997 Nobel Pr ize in Physiology or Medicine .31 In search for alternative labels to replace radioactive isotopes, Enzyme -Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) was introduced in the 1970s . In the typical double a ntibody sandwich ELISA , antibody attached to the bottom of a well provides both antigen capture and immune specificity, while another antibody linked to an enzyme provides det ection and an amplification factor . This approach enables accurate and sensitive detection of the antigen, the cytokine of interest. Because of these desirable features, ELISA has been considered the standard cytokine measurement method and is widely uti lized in clinical laboratories and biomedical research. ELISA kits for commonly measured cytokines are commercially available, often from multiple 31 Signosis BioSignal Capture, PSA ELISA, http://www.signosisinc.com/ProductData.cfm?cat=EA -0105. 15 Figure 14: General time -line of a primary infection with dengue virus, from identification and isolation of the virus to detection of IgM and IgG.34 vendors . Additional advantages of ELISA include the fact that results are highly quantitative and generally reproducible . 32 2.A.1 ELISA Diagnosis of Dengue The acquired immune response to infection with dengue virus consists of the production of IgM and IgG antibodies primarily directed against the virus envelope proteins . The immune response varies depen ding on whether the individual has a pr imary or a secondary infection . In general, serodiagnosis of dengue is dependent on th e stage of the infection . Fig. 14 depicts the general time-line of a primary infection from virus isolation/identification to det ection of IgM and IgG.3334 A primary infection with dengue is characterized by a slow and low -titre antibody response . IgM antibody is the first immunoglobulin isotype to appear . Anti-dengue IgG at low titre is detectable at the end of the first week of illness, increasing slowly thereafter . In contrast, during a secondary infection (a dengue infection in a host that had been previously infected by a dengue virus or other Flavivirus ) antibody titres rise extremely rapidly and antibody reacts broadly wit h many Flavivirus es . High levels of IgG are detectable even in the acute phase and they rise dramatically over the following 2 weeks . The kinetics of the IgM response are more variable.35 Since IgM levels are significantly lower in secondary dengue infec tions, some false -negative results in tests for anti -dengue IgM are observed during secondary infections . According to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) guidelines , IgM antibody is detectable by day 5 of illness in 80% of all dengue cases, and b y day 6 -10 of illness in 93 -99% of cases, and may then remain detectable for more than 90 days . IgM antibody -capture enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (MAC -ELISA) has become an important tool in the routine diagnosis of dengue; this technique has a sensit ivity and specificity of approximately 90% and 98%, respectively, but only when used 5 or more days after the onset of fever . Different formats, such as capture ELISA, capture ultramicroELISA, dot -ELISA, AuBioDOT IgM capture and dipsticks, have been devel oped . Serum, blood on filter paper, and saliva, but not urine, can be used for detection of IgM if samples are taken within the appropriate time frame (5 days or more after the onset of 32 Sean X. Leng et al. , ELISA and Multiplex Technology for Cytokinmeasurement in Inflammation and Aging and Aging Research, 6 3(8) J GERONTOL A BIOL. SCI. MED. SCI. 879-884 (2008). 33 Buchy et al., supra note 30. 34 Id. 35 Id. 16 fever) . The different commercial kits available have variable sensit ivity and specificity . A further challenge in the diagnosis of dengue is the fact that anti -dengue IgM antibodies also cross -react to some extent with other Flavivirus es, such as Japanese encephalitis, St Louis encephalitis and yellow fever.36 2.A.2 MAC ELISA IgM antibody capture ELISA assays will generally follow the following method: Solid-phase support (usually microt itre plate wells) are coated with anti -human IgM antibodies capable of binding all IgM isotype antibodies present in the specimen . Reag ent antigen is then added, followed by enzyme -labeled antigen -specific antibodies.37 If IgM antibodies specific for the antigen in question are present, the \"sandwich\" comple x will result in enzymatic colo r-change proportional to the concentration of IgM -specific antibody present.38 This technique appears to be the method of choice in many highly specific and more sensitive assays for IgM infectious disease antibodies.39 Up till now, ELISA has been considered the most useful test for dengue diagnosis, due to its high sensitivity and the ease of use.40 ELISA has been used to detect acute phase (IgM) and convalescent phase (IgG) antibodies, as well as for the detection of antigens (Ag).41 Since it is easy to perform and there is no need for sophisticated equipment , ELISA has become the most widely used serological method for dengue diagnosis.42 Also, due to its sensitivity for the detection of acute phase antibodies there is no need for convalescence samples since anti -dengue IgM antibodies appear within five days o f the first clinical symptoms.43 The IgM production varies considerably among the patients . Some patients will have IgM detectable by the 2nd to the 4th day after the beginning of the symptoms, while others do not develop detectable IgM until the 8th day a fter disease onset.44 The IgM antibody titers in primary infections are significantly higher than in secondary infections, although the detection of titers of 1:320 in some cases is not uncommon.45 The IgM production is much lower and transitory in secondary and tertiary infections . A small percentage of patients have secondary infection with no IgM antibodies detected.46 In dengue infections, the IgM monotypic response is not correlated with the serotype isolated from patients, and for this reason, MAC -ELIS A cannot be used for viral identification.47 MAC - 36 Id. 37 Mondofacto, IgM Antibody Capture ELISA (Mar. 5, 2000), http://www.mondofacto.com/facts/dictionary?IgM+antibody+capture+ELISA. 38 Id. 39 Id. 40 S\u00e9rgio Oliveira De Paula and Benedito Ant\u00f4nio Lopes da Fonseca, Dengue: A Review of the Laboratory Tests a Clinician Must Know to Achieve a Correct Diagnosis , 8(6) BRAZ.

They are the most common antibody, constitution about 75% to 80% of all the antibodies in the body, thus, are very important in fighting bacterial and viral infections.52 Dengue virus -specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) are found in the serum from patients with both acute primary infections and secondary dengue fever. 53 In primary dengue, IgG antibody begins to appear by the fifth day after onset of symptoms . Titres rise slowly for some weeks and then remain detectable for many years.54 In secondary infections, IgG antibody is generally already present in early acute serum samples and titres rise rapidly over a few days. 55 The dengue virus IgG -ELISA is intended for the qu alitative determination of IgG antibodies against dengue virus in human Serum.56 Conventional method of diagnosing dengue fever using IgG ELISA method entails obtaining anti -IgG-coated microtiter plates that captures the corresponding dengue virus IgG antibody from the serum of an Then horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labeled -IgG conjugate is added to plate.58 This conjugate binds to the captured dengue IgG antibodies . The immune complex formed by the bound conjugate is visualized by adding Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate wh ich gives a blue reaction product.59 The intensity of this product is proportional to the amount of dengue Virus - specific IgG antibodies in the serum . Then, sulphuric acid is added to stop the reaction, which produces a yellow endpoint color, and the color 's absorbance at 450 nm is read using an ELISA microwell plate reader.60 The obtained absorbance value is directly proportional to the amount of dengue -IgG present in the serum of the infected subject.61 48 Id. 49 Id. 50 Id. 51 Id. 52 Web MD, Immunoglobulins (Aug. 18, 2008), http://www.webmd.com/a -to-z-guides/immunoglobulins. 53 Laue et al., Detection of Dengue Virus RNA in Patients after Primary or Secondary Dengue Infection by Using the TaqMan Automated Amplification Syste m, 37 (8) J.

The process is dependent on thermal cycles used to heat and cool the reaction in order to promote DNA melting and enzymatic replication of the DNA. Each repetition of the cycl e theoretically doubles the amount of target DNA in the 62 Buchy et al., supra note 30. 63 Id. 64 Id. 65 AK Falconar et al., Altered enzyme -linked immunosorbent assa y immunoglobulin M (IgM)/IgG optical density ratios can correctly classify all primary or secondary dengue virus infections 1 day after the onset of symptoms, when all of the viruses can be isolated , 13 CLIN VACCINE IMMUNOL 1044 -1051 (2007). 66 Id. 67 Buchy et al., supra note 30; M. Guzman and G. Kouri, Dengue Diagnosis, Advances and Challenges , 8(2) INT'L J. OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES 71 (Mar. 2004). 68 Garrett, s upra note 2. 19 mixture . PCR begins with the preparation of denatured DNA containing the desired segment, which serves as a template for the DNA polymerase. Specific primers are then added to the denatured DNA in e xcess amounts of 1000 times or greater. The primers prime the DNA polymerase -catalyzed synthesis of the two complementary strands of the desired segment, doubling its concentration in the solution. The mixture is then heated to about 95\u00b0C in order to dissociate the DNA into duplexes. The mixture is then cooled to about 70\u00b0C to cause the primers to bind to both the newly formed and old strands of DNA. The process is then repeated, creating large magnitudes of the desired DNA strand.69 2.B.1 PCR Diagno sis of Dengue PCR is routinely used in the diagnosis of dengue fever .70 First, the initial reverse transcription and amplification steps are done using universal or serotype specific dengue primers which target a specific region of the viral genome.71 Whe n using the serotype specific primers, the primer will anneal in different regions of the viral cDNA depending on the serotype present.72 Then, a second amplification step, which is serotype specific, occurs. The products of these two amplification steps are separated by electrophoresis. The size of the bands resulting from the electrophoresis identifies the dengue serotypes present.73 There are many advantages related to using PCR in the diagnosis of dengue . An advantage of using RT -PCR for the diagno sis of dengue is that the process can be used to detect viral RNA with a high degree of sensitivity. However, the process is susceptible to contamination and manifests a high degree of variability.74 Another advantage of using this method for diagnosi ng dengue is that use of PCR allows dengue detection in long -term storage samples. Additionally, PCR makes possible the classification of dengue serotypes into subtypes according to genotypes because it allows for the identification of the serotypes resp onsible for a determined infection focus and the study of the genetic diversity of the strains, in order to identify the origins of epidemics and reveal virulence markers, when helped by nucleotide sequencing.75 Finally, PCR also permits quick detection a nd quantification of viral RNA in given samples. Along with advantages of using PCR for the diagnosis of dengue , the method also has some weaknesses. PCR demands specific laboratory equipment and suitable physical structure. Further, PCR requires ext ensive evaluation of protocols under the conditions of the field of the laboratory because of the possibility that there may be differences between strains circulating in different places.76 69 Garrett, supra note 2. 70 Buchy et al., supra note 30. 71 Id. 72 Nina Rocha Dutra et al .

The protein is secreted by mammalian cells, but not by insect cells.91 The secreted form of the protein is a hexamer composed of dimer subunits.92 Glycosylation of this protein is believed to be important for secretion.93 NS1 antigen appears as early as day 1 after the onset of fever and declines to undetectable levels after day 5 -6. NS1 is also a complement -fixing antigen and it produces a very strong humoral response.94 Because this protein is secreted, many studies have been dedicated to the utility of NS1 as a tool for the diagnosis of infection with dengue virus.95 These studies focus on various aspects of diagnosis, including antigen -capture enzyme -linked IgG responses.96 In the last 6 years there have been several studies addressing the use of NS1 antigen and anti - NS1 antibodies as a tool for the diagnosis of dengue.97 An antigen -capture ELISA test was described, with sensitivities ranging from 4 to 1 ng/ml.98 These studi es identified a correlation between disease severity and the quantity of NS1 antigen in the serum.99 Recently, a serotype - specific monoclonal antibody -based NS1 antigen -capture ELISA that showed good serotype specificity has been developed.100 Researchers have standardized an NS1 serotype specific IgG indirect ELISA to differentiate primary and secondary dengue virus infections and demonstrated a good correlation between anti -NS1 serotype -specific IgG IgG ELISA dengue virus in convalescent -phase sera from patients with primary infection and in acute -phase sera from patients with secondary infection (which would detect the serotype that caused the first infec tion), but not so with convalescent phase sera from patients with secondary infections.102 Because the results of these studies were varied, results correlating with IgM and IgG assays as well as disease severity and predictors of viraemia, further evaluatio n of this assay should be performed to determine the main differences between each study.103 89 Buchy et al., supra note 30. 90 Id. 91 Id. 92 Id. 93 Id. 94 Id. 95 Id. 96 Id. 97 Id. 98 Id. 99 Id. 100 Id. 101 Id. 102 Id. 103 Id. 22 Figure 16: computer -generated representation of t he r-DME -G protein in solution.106 Commercial kits for the detection of NS1 antigen in serum samples are available . These assays do not differentiate between the serotypes . As NS1 antigen appears early in infection and before the appearance of antibody, such assays are useful for early case detection and for outbreak investigations.104 Evaluations of these assays should be performed to assess their utility and cost - effectiveness.105 2.C.2 New Dengue Antibodies for ELISA synthetic antigens, recombinant dengue multiepitope protein (r -DME - G) have been designed for the purpose of diagnosing dengue .107 This multiepitope protein consists of several key IgG -specific immunod ominant epitopes that are encoded and NS3 proteins of the dengue virus.108 The E protein is the major structural component and the most immunogenic of all dengue viral proteins, which elicits the first and longest -lasting antibodies.109 NS1 and NS 3 proteins are non -structural proteins that elicit significant antibody responses upon dengue infection. In a standard ELISA, r-DME -G is able to accurately detect anti -dengue IgG antibody in serum from subjects infected with dengue virus.110 In the assay, r-DME -G is used as a capture antigen which binds to anti -dengue IgG antibody.111 Similarly, another recombinant antigen, trpE -DEN have been developed. This antigen consists of proteins that represent all four serotypes of dengue virus and ca n be used in standard ELISA as a capture protein for the detection of dengue IgG or IgM antibodies.112 104 Id. 105 Id. 106 Ravulapalli et al., A Custom -Designed Recombinant Multiepitope Protein as a Dengue Diagnostic Reagent , 41PROTEIN EXPRESSION & PURIFICATION , 140 (2005). 107 Id. 108 Id. 109 Id. 110 Id. 111 Ravulapalli et al., supra note 136 -47. 23 2.C.3 Luminescence -Based O ptical Fiber Biosensor Optical fibers are made of a glass or plastic core surrounded by a clad material of lower refractive index.113 Ligh t is reflected at the core -clad interface based on the difference in refractive indices.114 Light propagates through the fiber core and is transmitted the length of the fiber with minimal attenuation.115 Because of these properties, optical fibers are ideal to use for sensing as they enable light to be carried over long distances.116 117 Figure 17: Schematic of an optical fiber 117 In fluorescence -based sensing, excitation light is delivered through the fiber to a fluorescent indicator which is attached to the fiber's distal end.118 The resulting isotropic fluorescence emission is transmitted back through the fiber to a detector.119 Fluorescence assays can be multiplexed by simultaneously using multiple indicators reporting at different wavelengths.120 All fluo rescence imaging systems require specific instrumentation, but some common system components are present in all systems.121 112 Simmons et al., Evaluation of Rec ombinant Dengue Viral Envelope B Domain Protein Antigens for the Detection of Dengue Complex -Specific Antibodies . 58(2) AM.

The current patent landscape will provide an overview into the patents available for diagnostic tools available for dengue fever and will also provide an insight as to where these tools are currently being researched . Furthermore, this report will show the range of countries that are protected by these patent inventions and will provide a head start for conducting a patent landscape for future studies in dengue f ever vaccines. 129 Id. 130 Id. 131 Id. 132 Id. 133 Id. 134 Id. 26 VII. Patent Search Methodology and Results Patent Search Methodology The International Technology Transfer Institute (ITTI) team, under the direction of Professor Jon Cavicchi and technical supervisor Dr. Stanley Kowalski, began reviewing recent literature on the technology relating to the dengue virus and methods of diagnosing the dengue virus . The ITTI team commenced their searching with the basic search terms: dengue, diagnos*, and kit; then reviewed the results. The ITTI team began with a conference call between, ITTI team members, Professor Cavicchi, Dr. Stanley Kowalski and Dr. Anatole F. Krattiger in January 2010 . The scope of the project was defined as conducting a patent landscape analysis of technologies pertaining to means of diagnosing the dengue virus. This semester, Thomson Innovation\u00ae, a patent search platform, that integrates the b est of the suite of Thom son tools, Aureka\u00ae, Delphion\u00ae and Micropatent\u00ae, was utilized . Thomson Innovation\u00ae is a single, integrated solution that combines intellectual property, scientific literature, business data and news with analytic, collaboration and alerting tools in a robust platform. The six -member ITTI team was divided into thre e groups . Each group was lead by a team leader, while a project leader oversaw the entire ITTI project . Recent literature and a synonym list developed by the ITTI team were utilized to determine keywords . These keywords were then used to do preliminary searches on Thomson Innovation\u00ae and/or the USPTO . The initial keywords used in the two main categories in the search rounds were: 27 Dengue Diagnostic Specific Test Flavivir* Diagnos* PCR commenced an intense three -month journey of patent searching and coding . Thomson Innovation\u00ae was the primary patent searching database used by the team members . In addition to Thomson Innovatio n\u00ae, the ITTI team also used Westlaw\u00ae's Asian -Pacific database. These searches utilized keywords derived from the literature reviewed and initial searches to generate useful search strings; the searches also used U nited State s Patent Classifications and International Patent Classifications that were identified through subsequent searches and team meetings . The combination of keywords and classifications in search strings was useful for parsing the technology into compartments and allowing each team member to generate a different set of search results that keywords alone could not provide . This approach generated a broad set of patents . From here, keywords and classifications generated from this broad set of patents were used in subsequent rounds of searc hing. After each round of searching, team meetings would identify the most important keywords, and classifications for use in subsequent search strings that became more defined and effective. Many of these keywords were searched using the search field o f Title, Abstract and Claims within Thomson Innovation\u00ae. It was determined that searches under the Description and Specification fields were to be too broad . It was useful to limit each search using the specific terms und er the search field of Cla ims. 28 Patent Search Results The search strings gave us an outcome of more than 3,500 patents . Below is a list of search strings used in Thompson Innovation\u00ae. 2.A Patent Search Tables Database Thomson Innovation Title Abstract Claims: EP App, EP Grant, US App, US Grant, WO App Keywords dengue diagnos* kit* Classification/ Sub - Classification Not Applicable Search String CTB=(Dengue and diagnos* and kit*);

Total Hits 129 43 Patent Search Results Summary 3.A Categorization Summary Patent Documents for diagnosing the dengue fever wer e coded using three relevancy categories, one of those categories having four descriptive subcategories . The following categories were defined as follows for the purpose of this report. Coding Categorization of Patent Documents : 1. Relevant Technology - The first requirement to be relevant technology is that the patent claim s a diagnostic kit, method of diagnosis, or a component of diagnostic kits such as specific antibodies or PCR Primer DNA . In order to be a relevant technology category , the diagnos tic kit, method of diagnosis, or component of diagnostic kits claim s a kit or method for diagnosing dengue or Flavivirus (Flaviviridae ). For example, a claim that is described as A dengue virus detection method comprising: a. exposing as is found in patent document US20070134695A1 would be sufficient to be relevant because the patent claims either dengue or Flavivirus. However, the claim language A ki t for the detection of the presence of a virus in a direct clinical sample suspected of containing the virus, wherein the virus has a characteristic enzyme, said kit comprising . . . as found in patent document US5766841A, would be insufficient for this c ategory of the report because the patent does not claim dengue or Flavivirus . The four descriptive subcategories of the relevant technology category comprise: I. ELISA - Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay and NS -1 II. PCR - Polymerase Chain Reaction III. Luminescenc e Biosensors IV. Spectroscopy 2. Emerging Technology - To be a n emerging technology, the patent should claim a diagnostic kit, a method of diagnosis, or a composition of diagnostic kits such as specific antibodies or PCR Primer DNA . The emerging technology category differs from the relevant technology category in that the patent could claim a diagnostic kit, a method of diagnosis, or a composition of diagnostic kits such as specific antibodies or PCR Primer DNA for any type of virus although the technology i s not specific f or diagnosing dengue or a Flavivirus (Flaviviradae ). In addition, a 44 patent with claims in a language other than English would also fall under the emerging technology category. For example, a patent claiming, What is claimed is: A probe comprising a nucleotide sequence which can hybridize DNA I of an enteric virus . . . as found in patent document WO2003014397A1, would be considered a n emerging technology patent. Additionally, a secondary relevant patent could include a foreign patent that did not have claims or the claims were not translated, but based on the abstract, the document appeared to be of some relevance. For example a patent with no claims that has an abstract describing, a method for the diagnosis or the screening of an a rbovirus infection and prefer ably a flaviviridae infection and more preferably a flavivirus infection . . . as found in patent document WO2008152528A3, would fall under a emerging technology category. 3. Irrelevant - Patent documents determined to be i rrelevant fall outside the parameters of the relevant and emerging technology categories . For example, these patent documents do not include a diagnostic kit, a method of diagnosis, or a composition of diagnostic kits specifically for diagnosis of dengue o r Flavivirus . In addition , the irrelevant category also include s patent documents that specified a n irrele vant virus, such as Hepatitis B . As mentioned previously, if the patent document mentioned a diagnostic kit, a method of diagnosis, or a composition of diagnostic kits for a general virus, this would fall under the emerging technology category. 3.B Patent De -Duplication Process Each of the six team -members conducted searches independent of one another. All of the members search strings were combin ed and were then de -duplicated according to the INPADOC Family ID . The de -duplication step refers to the removal of patents documents within the same family so as to reduce redundancy during the patent coding process . There is no option to directly de -duplicate patents into one -per-family in Innovation\u00ae, we utilized the Display and Sort option in Innovation\u00ae to group together the family members having the same INPADOC family ID, and manually reduced the patents documents. The manually de -duplication proc ess includes several steps . First, all issued US patents within one INPADOC family were kept . Second, for a family having no US issued patent, all EP issued patents were be kept for coding . Finally, when no issued patent was available within one INPADOC family, patent applications with earliest priority date was be kept for review, and usually WIPO application or applications are the ones with the earliest priority date within one family . However, some families only contain foreign patents or patent app lications such as 45 Japan patents/applications, Korea patents/applications or China patents/applications . For these foreign patents or patent applications, we reviewed the translations made by Innovation and coded them accordingly. 3.C Patent Coding Result s Summary Final de -duplication brought in a result of 3,725 patent documents. The result was then extracted, using MicroPatent\u00ae, into PDF files containing title, abstracts and claims for coding. The 3,725 patent documents were divided among the six team members for coding. Each team member analyzed the claims in the documents and coded under one or more of the following nine categories. 1. Diagnostic Kit 2. Methods of Diagnosis 3. Compositions of Kits 4. ELISA 5. PCR 6. Luminescence Biosensors 7. Spectroscopy 8. Dengue Specif ic 9. Flavivirus Specific Of the 3,725 patent documents, 133 patent documents were found to be relevant technology , as noted by the yellow highlighting on the Master Spreadsheet shown in Section 3D. A patent document was considered to be relevant based on t wo requirements. First, the document had to specifically claim either diagnosing d engue or a Flavivirus (Flaviviridae ). Second, the patent had to claim a diagnostic kit, a method of diagnosis, a composition of a kit, or a combination thereof. The coding results were inserted into the Master Spreadsheet showing the categories of each pa tent. Of the 3,725 patent documents, 157 were coded as emerging technology, as noted by the purple highlighting on the Master Spreadsheet shown in Section 3E. In order for a patent to be coded as emerging technology, it must claim a method of diagnosis of a virus, a kit composition of a virus, or a diagnostic kit of a virus. It did not suffice if the patent claimed, for example, diagnosis of a disease. Further, patents that did not have dengue or Flavivirus in the claims, but did mention dengue or Flavivirus in the abstract or description were considered emerging technology patents. However, mentioning dengue or Flavivirus in the abstract or description was not a requi rement; the patent could claim a diagnosis method for a virus without the mention of dengue or Flavivirus in the patent and still be considered emerging technology. 46 Some of the emerging technology patents have notes on the Master Spreadsheet which say t hat the claims for the patent were in a language other than English . If all of the claims, abstract and description were in a language other than English , the team was unable to code the document . Therefore, these patent documents may be categorized as i rrelevant because it was impossible to ascertain whether the claims specified diagnosing dengue or Flavivirus . However, if adequate operational language was detected in any other portion of the document, it was included in the emerging technology category . Each patent document was initially coded by an individual team member, with emphasis placed on claim language to determine the relevancy of the patent document to the diagnosis of dengue . In determining the relevancy of the claims to the diagnosis of dengue, the individual team member would first establish if the claims related to the diagnosis of a virus. If the document did not relate to the diagnosis of a virus, the document was coded as irrelevant. The team member would then determine if the claim s were specific to dengue or Flavivirus . If the claims were for the specific purpose of diagnosing dengue or an infection of a Flavivirus , then the patent document was coded as relevant. If the claims pointed to a specific diagnostic method, the team mem ber would look at the language of the claims to determine if the method was ELISA, PCR, the use of luminescence biosensors or spectroscopy. If the patent did not specifically mention dengue or Flavivirus in the claims, but still claimed a diagnostic metho d, diagnostic kit, or kit composition relating to the diagnosis of a virus, the patent was coded as emerging technology. 47 3.D Spreadsheet for Relevant Technology Patent Document s Publication Number Title Diagnostic Kits Methods of Diagnosis Composition s of Kits E.L.I.S.A.

Assignees Error! Reference source not found. Figure 31 shows the top ten assignees for the relevant patent documents based on original assignee data. The Top 10 Assignees based on Original Data account for 59 of the 133 relevant patent documents. This means that approximately 44% of the relevant patent documents are attributable to the Top 10 Assignees based on Original Data (see Table 10). According t o the original assignee information, the top three assignees are Pasteur Institute, Nat. Environment Agency, and Shenzhen Taitai Gene Engineering. The top assignee, Pasteur Institute, accounts for about 5.25% of the total patent documents. Based on origi nal assignee data, there are twenty -six patents with the unspecified assignees. US patent applications are not required to include assignees for publication. Using and analyzing the information from Thomson Innovation\u00ae, it was verified that all twenty -six unspecified assignee documents are US patent applications. Further, all of the documents having unspecified assignees based on original data have DWPI assignees, which were also verified using Thomson Innovation\u00ae. Therefore, the unspecified assig nee documents according to the original data are accounted for in the analytics for the Top 10 Assignees based on DWPI Data. Figure 32 shows the top ten assignees according to the Derwent data. The Top 10 Assignees based on DWPI Data account for 51 of th e 133 relevant patent documents. This means that approximately 38% of the relevant patent documents are attributable to the Top 10 Assignees based on DWPI Data. According to the DWPI data, the top three assignees are US Department of Health, Pasteur Inst itute, and the National Environment Agency. The top assignee, the US Department of Health, accounts for about 23.5% of the patent documents. There are Derwent assignees available for all but one patent document that were analyzed. The one record without a DWPI assignee available is WO2006025990A3. The original assignee of this document is listed as being the United States Department of Health and Human Services Center for Disease Control and Prevention. 91 Assignee (Original) Patent Count Percentage AKZO NOBEL NV 3 2.26% CENTRE NAT RECH SCIENT 3 2.26% HAWAII BIOTECH GROUP 3 2.26% NAT ENVIRONMENT AGENCY 5 3.76% PASTEUR INSTITUT 7 5.26% SHENZHEN TAITAI GENE ENGINEERING 4 UNIV SINGAPORE 3 2.26% UNIV SOUTHERN MEDICAL 3 2.26% US HEALTH 2 1.50% Unspecified 26 19.55% Total documents from top 10 assignees 59 44.36% Total documents 133 100.00% Table 10: Top 10 assignee of original d ata in relevant technology patent document s Figure 31: Bar chart - patent count v. top 10 a ssignees of origi nal d ata in relevant technology patent document s 92 Assignee (DWPI) Patent Count Percentage CENT NAT RECH 4 3.01% 3 R H/PU 3 2.26% UNIV SINGAPORE 4 3.01% US DEPT HEALTH 12 9.02% US SEC OF NAVY 4 3.01% Total documents from top 10 assignees 51 38.35% Total documents 133 100.00% Table 11: Top 10 a ssignees of DWPI d ata in relevant technology patent document s Figure 32: Bar ch art - patent count v. t op 10 assignees of DWPI d ata in relevant technology patent document s 93 4.A.9 Patent Count v.

Documents with similar content are near each other in the content map, forming peaks, and the number of documents in a region is indicated by the height of the peaks in the landscape. Tall peaks indicate many documents, while small peaks indicate fewer documents. The relationship between the topics in the documents is drawn as the distance between peaks. Peaks that are located near each other have more similar topics than peaks that are located farther away. A Themescape map summarizing the title, abstract and claims of the Relevant Technology patents are found in Figure 34 and a themescape map summarizing the derwent title and abstract of the Relevant Technology patents are found in Figure 35.

IPC Classification IPC classification information is an international system from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and is used in more than 100 countries. The following analytics are based on the 157 emerging technology patent doc uments . The 157 patent documents fall into more than 20 IPC classifications, the top three IPC classes being Class A61K, Class C12Q and Class G01N with 14 patent document s do not have an IPC classification. When further divided into IPC sub - classifications , the top three sub -classifications belong to Class C12Q including C12Q01/68 and C12Q01/70 and Class G01N33/569. The definition of these IPC classifications and sub - classifications are shown in Appendix D.

Derwent Class (DWPI Class) DWPI classification information is available for 147 of the 157 patent documents coded as emerging technology. As shown in Table 22 , the documents fall into 17 DWPI classes, and the top two DWPI classes are Class B04, natural products and polymers, and Class A89, photographic, laboratory equipment, optical. These were the top two classes represented by the relevant patent documents as wel l (see Table 21). Almost 70% of the emerging technology patent document s belong to the Class B04. The 10 patent documents that are listed as unspecified are labeled as such because they have not been assigned a DWPI class based on the data available on Thomson\u00ae. The definitions of the Derwent classes listed in Table 22 below are shown and defined in Appendix E. DWPI Class -Main Patent Count 157 100.00% Table 22: DWPI Classes of Emerging Technology Patent Documents 113 Figure 47: Bar c hart - patent c ount v.

Assignees Table 24 shows the top ten assignees for the emerging technology p atent documents based on original assignee data. The Top 10 Assignees based on Original Data account for 55 of the 157 emerging technology documents. This means that approximately 35% of the emerging technology patent documents are attributable to the To p 10 Assignees based on Original Data. According to the original assignee information the top assignee is Pasteur Institute and accounts for about 5% of the total emerging technology documents analyzed. Based on original assignee data, there are twenty -five patents with the unspecified assignees. US patent applications are not required to include assignees for publication. Using and analyzing the information from Thomson Innovation\u00ae, it was verified that some of the twenty -six unspecified assignee documents are US patent applications. Further, all of the documents having unspecified assignees based on original data have DWPI assignees, which was also verified using Thomson Innovation\u00ae. Therefore, the unspecified assignee documents according to th e original data are accounted for in the analytics for the Top 10 Assignees based on DWPI Data as shown in Table 24. Table 25 below shows the top ten assignees according to the Derwent data. The Top 10 Assignees based on DWPI Data account for 42 of the 1 57 emerging technology documents. This means that approximately 26.75% of the emerging technology patent documents are attributable to the Top 10 Assignees based on DWPI Data. According to the DWPI data, the top assignee is Pasteur Institute and accounts for about 5.75% of the total emerging technology documents analyzed. There are 10 patent documents that fall into the unspecified category because they do not have DWPI Assignees/Applicants. However, these 10 documents do have original data Assignees/ Applicants, which was verified using Thomson Innovation\u00ae. Therefore, the unspecified documents for the DWPI assignees are accounted for in the analytics for the Top 10 Assignees based on Original Data, seen in Table 25 . 117 Assignee (Original) Patent Count Percentage AMSON ROBERT 3 1.91% CENTRE RECH SCIENT 2 INC 3 1.91% ISIS 2 1.27% ENGINES LAB 3 INSTITUT ADAM 1.91% US GOVERNMENT 3 1.91% unspecified 25 15.92% Total documents from top 10 assignees 55 35.03% Total documents 157 100.00% Table 24: Top 10 assignees of original data in emerging technology patent d ocuments Figure 50: Bar chart - patent count v. top 10 a ssignees of original data in emerging technology patent d ocuments 118 Assignee (DWPI) Patent Count Percentage AGENCY SCI TEC 3 1.91% CENT NAT RECH 3 1.91% CNRS CENT NAT 2 1.27% GILEAD 2.55% US DEPT HEALTH 3 1.91% unspecified 10 6.37% Total documents from top 10 assignees 42 26.75% Total documents 157 100.00% Table 25: Top 10 Assignees of DWPI Data in Emerging Technology Patent Documents Figure 51: Bar chart - patent count v. top 10 assignees of DWPI d ata in emerging t echnology patent do cuments 119 4.B.9 Patent Count v.

Publication Date The following table and graph show the publishing trends of patents and patent applications worldwide that are relevant to Dengue diagnostic. Analysis of relevant patent and patent application tren ds shows a steady increase in publication till 2005. Publication rate stayed nearly similar during 2005 - 2007 and then increased. This increase may be a result of more regions, countries, and people being affected by dengue fever. The reduction in publ ication in 2010 is a result of not having completed the year and having patent documents in the process of being published. 129 Publication Year Document Count 2010 13 2009 59 2008 35 2007 21 2006 25 2005 20 2004 27 2003 16 2002 16 2001 11 2000 9 1999 10 1998 6 1997 3 1995 5 1993 5 1992 2 1991 2 1989 2 1987 1 Table 30: Publication t rends of relevant and emerging technology patent documents worldwide for the last twenty years 130 Figure 59 : Line graph depicting publication trends of relevant and emerg ing patent documents worldwide for the last twenty years 131 4.C.3 Patent Count v. Application (Filing) Date The following table s and graph show the application filing trends of patent documents worldwide that seem to cover relevant and emerging technolog ies. Analysis of these patent documents trends show a drastic increase in filing date during the years 200 3 onwards . This increase may be a result of more regions, countries, and people being affected by dengue.

US Classification US classification information is only available for US issued patents and US patent applications. The following analytics are based on the 112 relevant and emerging t echnolo gy US patents document s with 178 of the remaining relevant and emerging technology patent documents not analyzed as they are not categorized under this US classification system . The 112 US patent document s fall into 17 US classes with the top two US classe s being Class 424 and Class 435. When further divided into US sub -classification, the top five sub -classifications belong to Class 424/218.1, Class 435 including 435/005, 435/006, 435/007.1, and Class 530/350. The definition of these US classifications and sub-classifications a re shown in Appendix C. Table 30 and Figure 59 , a bar graph, show the top 17 3 -digit US classes of these 102 relevant and emerging technology patent document s from the United States.

IPC Classification IPC classification information is an international system from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and is used in more than 100 countries. The following analytics are based on the 290 relevant and emerging technology patent documents. The 290 patent documents fall into more than 20 IPC classifications the top three IPC classes being Class C07K, Class C12Q and Class G01N and 15 patent documents have no IPC classification. When fur ther divided into IPC sub -classifications, the top five sub -classifications belong to Class C07K including C07K14/005 and C07K14/18, Class C07Q including C07Q1/68 and C07Q1/70, and Class G01N33/569. The definition of these IPC classifications and sub -class ifications are shown in Appendix D. Table 32 and Figure 62 , a bar graph, show the top 20 IPC classes of the relevant and emerging technology patent documents. Table 33 and Figure 6 3, a bar graph, show the top 20 IPC classes/sub -classes of the relevant and emerging technology patent documents. 137 IPC Class Patent Count G01N 133 C12Q 129 C07K 88 80 2 C07M 1 Table 34: Top 20 IPC classes for r elevant and emerging technology patent d ocuments Figure 64: Bar graph of the top 20 IPC classes of relevant and emerging technology patent documents 138 IPC Class Patent Count C12Q0001/70 87 G01N0033/569 72 C12Q0001/68 15 Table 35: Top 20 IPC classes/sub -classes for relevant and emerging technology patent d ocuments Figure 65: Bar graph of the top 20 IPC classes/sub -classes of relevant and emerging technology patent d ocuments (unspecified = no IPC) 139 4.C.6 Patent Coun t v. Derwent Class (DWPI Class) The DWPI analytics on Thomson Innovation can only show data for the top 20 classes. This leads to the program creating graphs based on 289 of the 290 total patent documents. Consequently, one DWPI class is missing from th e data set. By looking through the data on Thomson Innovation\u00ae, it was determined that the missing class is P75, typewriters, stamps, duplicators. DWPI classification information is unavailable for 11 of the 290 total patent documents analyzed in this re port. As shown in Table 36 plus the addition of the one missing DWPI class as previously discussed, the patent documents fall into 20 DWPI classes. The top three DWPI classes are Class B04, Class A89, and Class A96 (natural products and polymers; photogr aphic, laboratory equipment; and medical, dental, veterinary, cosmetic, respectively). Over 75% of the total documents belong to Class B04. Of the 290 total patent documents, 11 are classified as unspecified in regards to DWPI classification, as they h ave not been assigned a DWPI classification per Thomson Innovation\u00ae. The definitions of the Derwent classes listed in Table 36 below are shown in Appendix E. 140 DWPI Class -Main Patent Count 100.00% Table 36: DWPI classes on relevant and emerging technology p atent documents 141 Figure 66: Bar c hart - patent count v.

Assignees Table 3 8 shows the top ten assignees for all of patent documents based on original assignee data. The Top 10 Assignees based on Original Data account for 99 of the 290 total patent documents. This means that approximately 34% of the total patent documents are attribut able to the Top 10 Assignees based on Original Data. According to the original assignee information, the top assignee is the Pasteur Institute, which accounts for about 5% of the total patent documents. Based on original assignee data, there are 51 docum ents with an unspecified assignee. US patent applications are not requires to include assignees for publication. Using and analyzing the information available on Thomson Innovation \u00ae, it was verified that some of the unspecified assignee documents are US patent applications. Furthermore it was verified using Thomson Innovation\u00ae that all of the documents having unspecified assignees based on original data do have DWPI assignees. Therefore, the unspecified assignee documents according to the original data are accounted for in the analytics for the Top 10 Assignees based on DWPI Data shown in Table 38. Table 39 shows the Top 10 Assignees according to the Derwent Data. The Top 10 Assignees based on DWPI Data account for 80 of the 290 total patent docu ments. This means that approximately 28% of the total patent documents are attributable to the Top 10 Assignees based on DWPI Data. According to the DWPI data, the top assignee is Pasteur Institute, which accounts for almost 6% of the total patent docume nts. There are 11 patents documents that fall into the unspecified category because they do not have DWPI Assignees/Applicants. These 11 documents do, however, have original data assignees/applicants, which was verified using Thomson Innovation\u00ae. Ther efore, the unspecified documents for the DWPI assignees are accounted for in the analytics for the Top 10 Assignees based on Original Data, seen in Table 39 . 145 Assignee (Original) Patent Count Percentage AKZO NOBEL NV 3 1.03% CENTRE NAT RECH SCIENT 5 1.72% HAWAII BIOTECH GROUP 4 1.38% ISIS PHARMACEUTICALS INC 3 1.03% NAT ENVIRONMENT AGENCY 5 1.72% PASTEUR INSTITUT 15 5.17% SHENZHEN TAITAI GENE ENGINEERING 5 1.72% UNIV TEXAS 4 1.38% US GOVERNMENT 4 1.38% unspecified 51 17.59% Total documents from top 10 assignees 99 34.14% Total documents 290 100.00% Table 38: Top 10 a ssignees (original d ata) - relevant and emerging technology patent d ocuments Figure 69: Bar chart - patent count v. top 10 a ssignees (original data) r elevant and emerging t echn ology patent d ocuments 146 Assignee (DWPI) Patent Count Percentage CENT NAT RECH 7 2.41% NAT INC 4 1.38% NAT ENVIRONMENT 7 2.41% US DEPT HEALTH 15 5.17% US SEC OF NAVY 4 1.38% unspecified 11 3.79% Total documents from top 10 assignees 80 27.59% Total documents 290 100.00% Table 39: Top 10 a ssignees (DWPI ) relevant and emerging technology patent d ocuments Figure 70: Bar chart - top 10 a ssignees (DWPI ) relevant and emerging technology patent d ocuments 147 4.C.9 Patent Count v.

Swaminathan S , Khanna N . Recombinant Gene Products Group, International Centre for Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology, P.O. Box 10504, Aruna . swami@icgeb.res.in Dengue is a ver y rapidly growing public health problem being currently faced by approximately 40% of the global population living in more than a hundred tropical and sub -tropical countries. It is a viral disease, caused by four types of dengue viruses, transmitted by mos quitoes, to an estimated 50 million people each year. Vector control methods to contain transmission have not been successful and there is currently no useful diagnostic test, drug or vaccine to combat dengue disease. However, as a result of the heightened awareness of its magnitude and its potential to spread beyond the tropical world, dengue has begun to emerge out of the list of neglected diseases in recent years. New interest in this disease has drawn scientists from multiple disciplines into the dengue arena. This has resulted in novel insights into several aspects of dengue virus biology and identified potential drug targets. Several tetravalent vaccines are being developed. Newer animal models that mirror some of the salient features of dengue disease are becoming available to investigate the mechanism of pathogenesis and to aid in drug and vaccine discovery efforts. The realization that therapeutic and prophylactic intervention can be cost - effective has resulted in vigorous industry -driven translation al initiatives to develop drugs and vaccines. Dengue research is at a critical juncture and the implementation of existing knowledge supplemented by a better understanding of pathogenesis promises to make a tangible impact in the combat against dengue in t he coming years.

As dengue is increasing in incidence, improved diagnosis, early detection of severe cases, and efficient medical management are of primary impor tance in all areas where dengue is endemic . Traditionally, dengue has been diagnosed by virus isolation or serological methods, but with recent advances in molecular techniques and in rapid detection technology, a range of novel diagnostic tests will soon be commercially available that will improve case management and aid disease control efforts . The goal of this paper is to review the diagnostic tools that are currently available or in development and their potential role in case detection, identificatio n of prognostic markers of severe disease, surveillance and outbreak investigations. 159 3.

Virology Department, PAHO/WHO Collaborating Center for Viral Diseases, 'Pedro Kouri;' Tropical Medicine Institute, Autopista Novia Ciudad Habana, C uba. lupe@ipk.sld.cu Dengue diagnosis was one of the topics discussed at the symposium 'The Global Threat of Dengue - Desperately Seeking Solutions' organized during the 10th International Congress of Infectious Diseases held in Singapore in 2002 . In thi s paper, a review is presented focusing on the main advances, problems and challenges of dengue diagnosis.IgM capture ELISA, virus isolation in mosquito cell lines and live mosquitoes, dengue specific monoclonal antibodies and PCR have all represented majo r advances in dengue diagnosis . However, an appropriate rapid, early and accessible diagnostic method useful both for epidemiological surveillance and clinical diagnosis is still needed . Also, tools that suggest a prognosis allowing for better management are also needed . Finally, laboratory infrastructure, technical expertise and research capacity must be improved in endemic countries in order to positively influence dengue surveillance, clinical case management and the development of new approaches to d engue control. PMID: 14732325 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE] 160 4. Rev Med Virol. 2005 Sep Brazil. The conventional diagnosis of de ngue virus infections includes the detection of the virus in serum or tissue samples, both by isolation in culture or through detection of specific viral molecules (genome RNA or dengue antigens) and detection of specific anti -dengue antibodies (serology) . Isolation of dengue virus provides the most direct and conclusive approach to diagnosis, despite the demand for high -level equipment, technical skills and manpower. However, it is useless in early diagnosis because several days are required to isolate an d classify the virus. Serology, despite being simpler, is not able to afford an accurate early diagnosis in primary infections because 4 -5 days are required for the immune system to produce a sufficient amount of antibodies. Moreover, it leads to misleadin g results in secondary infections owing to cross -reactivity among serotype -specific antibodies and with other Flavivirus antibodies. The RT-PCR and other PCR -based techniques are fast, serotype -discriminating, more sensitive and easier to carry out than co nventional nucleic -acid hybridisation, but are handicapped by easy sample contamination and high technological demands . Recently, advances in bioelectronics have generated commercial kits and new techniques for detection of dengue antibodies and RNA, base d on biosensor technology . Most of them are rapid, easy to operate, reusable, cheap, sensitive and serotype -specific . Nevertheless, their accuracy is still questionable because most still lack validation and standardisation . This review summarizes and d escribes the techniques currently employed and anticipated in the near future for diagnosis of dengue disease . Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

There are about 450 Classes of invention and about 150,000 subclasses of invention in the USPC. Classifications are typically expressed as \"482/1\". o The first number, 482, represents the class of invention. o The number following th e slash is the subclass of invention within the class. Patents are always classified at the subclass level. A Subclass definition is a complete description of the subclass . The Subclass Definition can incorporate an explanation of the class, a glossary, s earch notes, references to subclasses within the class, and references to other classes and subclasses. Classes and subclasses have titles which provide a short description of the class or subclass. Classes and subclasses also have definitions which provid e a more detailed explanation. Many Classes and subclasses have explicitly defined relationships to one another. One or more classifications (i.e., class/subclass designations) are assigned to each granted patent and each published application. A patent classification also represents a searchable collection of patents grouped together according to similarly claimed subject matter. A classification is used both as a tool for finding patents (patentability searches) and for assisting in the assignment of pa tent applications to examiners for examination purposes.

The IPC consists o f several hierarchical levels; it divides technology into eight sections (A through G) with approximately 70,000 subdivisions. The IPCs are typically expressed as A63C 11/14. o A represents a Section. o The number following a Section, 63, is a Class. o C represents a Subclass. o 11 is a Main group. o The number following the slash, 14, is a Subgroup. The authentic version of the IPC is published in English and French languages . Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Dutch German, Hungarian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Rom anian, Russian, Serbian, and Spanish versions are also available. The IPC is used in more than 100 countries . Thus, the IPC is used as a tool for finding, for example, both US and JP documents.

International Patent Classification (IPC) is an inter nationally recognized classification system, which is controlled by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and assigned to patent documents by Patent Offices. Where possible Thomson indicated next to the Class the equivalent IPC in an abbrevia ted form (e.g. A47, F23-5). However, this should only be taken as a guide, since there are areas where the DWPI Classes are assigned intellectually by Thomson's subject experts, and no strict correspondence is claimed.

All of these family members are related to one another by common priori ty numbers with associated priority dates . The concept of the patent family first emerged through the Paris Convention on the Protection of Industrial Property in 1883, while automated systems enabling patent family searching became available through th e establishment of the IIB in The Hague in 1947 and INPADOC in Vienna in 1972 . Since then, patent searching has evolved due to exponential improvements in computing and communications technology. The term patent family can be defined in a number of ways, depending on the relationship between a patent document and its priority or priorities within the meaning of the Paris Convention . The differences only become obvious when the structure of a patent application is complex, i.e. when applications are filed in several countries . Such applications may cite various earlier applications as priorities, or the diverse patent offices involved in the grant process may accept or refuse different patent claims . This results in patents which have different scopes of protection. An important point when using any database to retrieve information on patent families is that there is never any guarantee that you will find all the corresponding patent documents that exist . Database producers do what they can to ensure co mpleteness, but they can never guarantee it .136 The \"Extended\" (INPADOC) Patent F amily The bibliographic and legal status databases form the basis of the EPO's raw data resources (INPADOC) . In February 2008 the bibliographic data included about 60 milli on bibliographic data sets from almost 80 different countries . The legal status database contains a collection of more than 50 million legal events from 48 countries. From the beginning, the concept was to cover as many countries and as many publication levels as possible . One of the strongest motives for the integration of INPADOC into the EPO was the wish to combine the particular strengths of INPADOC with the EPO's existing in -house bibliographic database, \"DOC -DB\". Following integration of the two databases in the 1990s, the raw data behind both databases is now the same . And since esp@cenet draws on the same pool of data as raw data resources (INPADOC) and DOC -DB, it c ontains the same documentation. 136 European Patent Office, Patent Families (Feb. 29, 2008), http://www.epo.org/patents/patent - information/about/families.html 170 However, the philosophy of the \"extended\" (INPA DOC) patent family is quite different, and so are the results of family searches . Unlike the \"also published as\" feature in esp@cenet , which only shows \"equivalents\", i.e. almost identical documents, an INPADOC family search should retrieve all documents relating in any way to the root document. Features of INPADOC When using INPADOC via one of the commercial database host services, it bears all the esp@cenet features, plus the following: Standardisation of applicant and inventor names References to abstracts from Chemical Abstracts and Thomson Scientific Abstracts are made within the patent family By including the legal status database additional information is available and additional family links can be established National application numbers, i nternational application numbers and domestic relations are included in the family search For both the EPO's raw data resources (INPADOC) and esp@cenet, even where no priority has been claimed by the patent applicant, artificial or \"intellectual\" links ar e built in a systematic way for the complete PCT minimum documentation . The same is done for older documents (pre - 1968) for which the priority information is not complete. Definition of the \"extended\" (INPADOC) patent family All the documents directly o r indirectly linked via a priority document belong to one patent family . In the case shown below, documents D1 to D5 belong to the same patent family, P1. FAMILY P1 Document D1 Priority P1 Document D2 Priority P1 Priority P2 Document D3 Priority P1 Priority P2 Document D4 Priority P2 Priority P3 Document D5 Priority P3 171 As mentioned above, national application numbers, international application numbers and domestic relations are included in the family search. In the \"extended\" (INPADOC) pa tent family it does not matter where you start the search . It can be an application number, a priority application number or a publication number. If the search starts with a publication number, all application numbers, domestic application numbers, prio rity numbers and international application numbers are used to retrieve additional documents . For all documents found in this step, step one is repeated . This iteration process ends only when no more new documents can be found. Raw data resources (INPAD OC) also use some additional sophisticated rules for certain countries, for example if publication numbers are used instead of priority numbers in the original documents . This happened rather frequently for older documents, when the priority claims were not treated as carefully as they are now. The inclusion of legal status information in the patent search also sometimes retrieves additional links, e.g. for divisional applications, continuations, continuations in part or national publications of first fil ings of PCT (international) applications, where the priority links are often missing. Limitations of the family search in raw data resources (INPADOC) Like all other patent databases, the EPO's raw data resources (INPADOC) have to rely on the correctnes s of the data supplied by the co -operating patent offices and the extent to which it is up to date . In particular, delays in the delivery of bibliographic data can vary significantly depending on the country concerned and the time period covered . Before relying on the completeness of a patent family, users should check where there are gaps or delays in certain areas . You can find this kind of information in the PFS and PRS statistics on the internet, which are updated weekly and contain indications of mi ssing or delayed document series . See raw data resources (INPADOC) useful tables and statistics. To be absolutely sure about the actual status of a patent, users are recommended to contact the appropriate patent issuing authority direct. Particular car e has to be taken in the case of European patents which have entered into the national phase . Here the completeness and accuracy of data can vary significantly from country to country . A good overview of the volume and kind of \"post -grant\" information av ailable in raw data resources (INPADOC) can be found in the raw data resources (INPADOC) FAQ . For most of the EPO member states, information about the validation, lapse, etc., of European patents is given as part of the legal status information, and as me ntioned before is less consistent due to the different quality of data available . Starting from week 50/2007, additional post -grant 172 information is taken from the fee administration system and included in the legal status part of the database. Example of an \"extended\" (INPADOC) patent family The same example is used as for the esp@cenet patent family previously (US5402857) . See the example as a PDF document. As you can see, the iterative INPADOC search retrieves 81 document records, of which esp@cenet displayed only five . The information available includes 323 legal status events (not shown in the example above) . This higher recall of documents reflects not only the different philosophies of the two systems, but also the fact that INPADOC displays all publication levels within one country as separate family members. 137 Thomson Scientific WPI Patent Family (DWPI) Patent Families in the Thomson Scientific World Patents Index (WPI) draw together patents covering the same invention . Their relationship is defined by the priority or application details claimed by each document . Thus, in its simplest form, a new document (D1) claiming a unique priority (P1) will be assigned to be the basic of its own, new patent family in Thomson Scientific WPI. Subse quently, if a second document (D2) also claiming priority P1 is received by Thomson Scientific this will be added (as an equivalent) to the patent family already containing document D1 . Other documents claiming priority P1 will also be added to this fam ily as equivalents as they are included in the database . Thus, a patent family may contain anything from a single document to 10 or more . Each patent family represents a single record in the Thomson Scientific WPI database. The basic document is the f irst member of a patent family that appears in Thomson Scientific WPI, so it may not necessarily be the first one published for that invention. Differences in the speed that patenting authorities supply data to Thomson Scientific, and in the processing ti me for documents from different countries may affect which document appears in Thomson Scientific WPI first and becomes basic. Patents often claim more than a single priority and these must match before any equivalent is added to a family. This means that if a basic document (D3) claims priorities P2, P3 & P4, a subsequent document (D4) claiming priorities P2 & P3 will be added to the family as an equivalent, whereas patent D5 which claims priorities P2, P3 and a unique priority (P5) will form the basis of a new, but related patent family. In cases such as this, the accession number of any related family is included in the cross -reference field of each relevant Thomson Scientific WPI record. 137 Id. 173 Divisions and continuation patents maintain the same status as th e original specification. This means that if GB1 is a basic, and GB2 is divisional to GB1, then GB2 will also be a basic (in its own family). However, if GB1 is equivalent to another document already in the Thomson Scientific WPI database, then GB2 will a lso join this family as an equivalent. It should be noted that family relationships will be defined by the order in which patents appear in Thomson Scientific WPI. Thomson Scientific also puts a lot of resources into including patents in families even wh en no foreign priority is claimed, e.g. when an application has been made beyond the 12 months defined by the Paris Convention. Thomson Scientific identifies these \"non -convention\" equivalents by the presence of foreign nationals and addresses in the Inven tor field in the absence of priority data other than the local filing details. Equivalency is determined through a time-consuming manual check of inventors, subject matter, etc. In this way Thomson Scientific attempts to make patent families in Thomson Sc ientific PI as comprehensive as possible. However, because of the incidence of multiple priorities, and patent divisions and continuations (especially continuing applications in US documents), it is important to retrieve all related families through their common priorities in order to have a comprehensive overview of patent family relationships. 138 138 Id. 174 APPENDIX G: PCT World Map 175 APPENDIX H: Author s' Resumes 176 177 178 Amrita K.
