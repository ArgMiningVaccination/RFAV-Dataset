CMIC CMO USA Corporation 3 Cedar Brook www.cmiccmousa.com THE EDITOR JORG GREUEL/PHOTODISC/GETTY IMAGESPharmTech.com/forum I'm going into my sixth year working on PharmTech and it's been quite an exciting few years given the changing industry dynamics and major shifts in regulation\u2014both of which are becom-ing more global and more transparent. It's also an exciting time because Phar- maceutical Technology is celebrating its 35 th anniversary. In fact, you'll find unique retrospectives and forward-looking pieces from industry experts throughout the pages of this issue and on our website, at PharmTech.com. One area of change that I've been following closely is the globalization of the industry. Companies are now expected to perform site visits and au-dits of all of their suppliers and con-tact service providers in addition to the multiple audits that they must host from regulators each year. It's been fascinating to watch industry form its own consortiums and third-party au-diting schemes to address these needs. The industry is becoming more open to sharing information as well, which is quite a feat in a patent-driven envi-ronment. At the same time, FDA has taken a much stronger stance during the past few years\u2014and really the agency has had to do this\u2014to manage the com-plexities of the pharmaceutical supply chain and related challenges, such as counterfeiting and economically mo-tivated adulteration. Our Washington Editor Jill Wechsler had the opportu-nity to speak with FDA 's Deputy Com-missioner Deborah Author about these issues and where the agency is headed to meet the ever-expanding needs that come with globalization. See page 26, or listen to the full interview as a pod-cast on PharmTech.com. Industry is also making great strides in the way it approaches manufactur-ing and testing as it works to implement risk- and quality-based approaches. People are questioning current prac-tice and seeking ways to find and share best practices. We're especially seeing this in the area of impurities and vis-ible particles (see page 86), as well as in continuous processing and platform approaches. In this anniversary issue, we take a look back at how manufac-turing, drug delivery and formulation, analytical methods, and outsourcinghave changed in terms of key achieve- ments and trends. In addition, experts, including the presidents of PhRMA, BIO, and AAPS (see page 142), provide their views on what the future holds for the industry. I am happy to say that PharmTech is, and has been, right in the middle of these issues. We are working with the industry and standard-setting or-ganizations to get the best information available to you, whether it's the latest monograph change or FDA-issued guidance, troubleshooting tips for equipment and processing, emerg-ing pipeline and business strategies, or novel approaches to manufactur-ing. We believe that this magazine of-fers the most relevant material for the global industry as it carries out day-to-day work, and we intend to continue carrying out that mission. Looking ahead to the next 35 years, PharmTech is taking advantage of the industry's transformation and regula-tory dynamics to make some changes of its own. Readers and online users are already taking part in our growing online communities through LinkedIn and Twitter (check out the PharmTech-Group feeds). We're also planning to make some visual changes to the mag-azine in the coming months. Overall, I'm quite excited about what the fu-ture has in store and hope to bring you along with us.

An interesting aspect of HME is the variety of physical forms that can be given to the melt after mixing. At Leistritz's processing lab, for example, seminar attendees observed demonstration lines producing cast film, tubing, and pel-lets. Films can be used for dosage forms such as dissolvable films or transdermal patches. Pellets can be filled in capsules, punched directly into tablets, or granulated for traditional tablet production. Foamed pellets for fast-acting dosage forms are a novel development. Extruded rods and fibers are also being used as a dosage form. Cutting extruded pharmaceutical for- mulations is often difficult because the polymers used are prone to fracture or smearing during pelletizing. Optimizing temperature and blade shape can help to solve cutting problems and minimize par-ticulate generation, explained Bob Besse-mer, sales manager for medical extrusion at the Conair Group, in his presentation. He noted that there are many technolo-gies used in plastics extrusion that could potentially be applied to pharmaceutical extrusion. In wood-plastics composite processing, for example, extra sections are added to the end of the extruder to control cooling and thus improve cutting. He pre-dicts that someday pharma manufacturers will be able to cut extrudate directly into tablets, once the problems of cutting and swelling are solved. Borrowing another common plastics processing technique, tablets could also be directly injection molded after extru-sion, noted other presenters. Looking to the expertise of the plastics industry may help propel development of pharmaceutical extrusion. PT Thorsten Cech, an enabler rtunities.Kollicoat\u00ae Smartseal 30 D - Active Protection.

Report from: Europe Drug regulatory agencies in Europe are reporting, either in absolute terms or proportionately, rises in deficiencies found in pharmaceuti-cal plants across the world during GMP inspections. The increases seem to be related to the growing number and scope of inspections, although some speculate that the expansion of manufacturing outsourcing, particularly to producers in Asia, also has some-thing to do with it. The most significant rise in deficiencies has been recorded by EMA, which is the centralized authority of medicines in the European Union. In its latest annual report, published in June 2012, EMA revealed that there has been a 38% increase since 2011 in quality defects. These defects are primarily tied to GMPs and other standards such as Good Clinical Practices (GCPs). contin. on page for PharmTech.comIN THE FIELD 18 Pharmaceutical Technology JULY 2012 PharmTech.comcontin. from page 16 The number of quality defects has almost doubled since 2009, going from 80 to 154 in 2011. At the same time, the num-ber of GMP inspections have gone up from 175 to 375 over the three-year period. Inspections have increased to more closely monitor the production of APIs and overall quality at multi-product sites, where manufacturers are making both finished products and drug substance, according to EMA. Some of the reported deficiencies have been related to \"the increasing numbers of centrally authorized products (and) the inclusion of a basic compliance evaluation of printed packag-ing material,\" says an EMA official. The agency has widened the breadth of its compliance checks by including coverage of what it classifies as \"minor\" issues because such problems could indicate a departure from GMP. \"EMA has updated and refined its standard operating procedure (SOPs) for report-ing of product defects in 2009 which may be reflected in the absolute numbers of defects subsequently reported,\" explains a spokesperson for the Association of the British Pharmaceuti- cal Industry (ABPI) in London. The association also points out that, despite the recent rise in quality defects reported by EMA, there were \" fewer product recalls overall\u2014the number of Class 1 recalls, the highest risk category of recall, went down from 14 to 2.\" Among national regulatory agencies in the EU, a large proportion of whose GMP inspections cover the production of generic drugs and their APIs, there are mounting worries about the rise, either in absolute terms or proportionately, of specific deficiencies. In the latest report on GMP inspections for fiscal year 2011-2012 from the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the proportion of \"critical\" deficiencies or those with a significant risk of causing harm to patients went up from 6.5% of inspections in 2010-2011 to 8.6% this past year. The agency now has a program directing its inspections at higher risk operations. \"As a result, the focus of the inspections in general may change or for higher risk sites the inspection may target certain areas of concern,\" says Ian Jackson, the MHRA's operations manager and senior GMP inspector. The list of the agency's Top 10 GMP deficiencies for the past year was again topped by unsatisfactory investigation of anomalies in production. Other categories moving up the de-ficiency ranks were poor quality management, inappropriate response to complaints, substandard process validation, and unsatisfactory auditing of suppliers. Contamination appeared to be an increasing problem as well with incidents of defective control of microbial contamination doubling. Neither EMA nor MHRA are blaming the current level of GMP defects on the increase in exports of drugs and their active ingredients into the EU from countries, such as India and China. \"There is no evidence that suggests a bias between prod- ucts manufactured inside or outside the EU,\" says the EMA official. However, production standards in Asia and in other non-EU areas could become more of an issue next year when the region's new Falsified Medicines Directive, aimed at combating counterfeit medicines, starts to be enforced. This directive requires stepping up GMP inspections of the API production sites supplying Europe, a large proportion of which are based in Asia. National agencies within the EU have already begun to warn pharmaceutical manufacturers that they should not use active ingredients from non-GMP API manufacturers outside the EU. Starting in 2013, EU manufacturers will have to be even more vigilant about the source and quality of their supplies. \u2014Sean Milmo is a freelance writer based in Essex, UK.

A: FDA in- spections will continue to rise, particularly after recently passed user-fee bills in the House and Senate come together and a final law is enacted. The law will better enable FDA to meet the challenges of globalization, promote innovation, mitigate product shortage sit- uations and, through harmonization and direct action, extend inspectional coverage to the global regulated industries. In July 2011, FDA published a roadmap for addressing the challenges of global-ization. The \"Pathway to Global Product Safety and Quality\" is based on four core building blocks: with a global coalition of regulators, build and strengthen the prod-uct safety net around the world; develop a global data-information system; expand intelligence gathering and use, focused on risk analytics and modernized IT; leverage and prioritize resources based on risk. Bolstered by impending legislation, the agency's roadmap becomes feasible. In the years ahead, the worldwide indus-try should expect to see: improved con-sistency among regulatory inspections; inspections that are well-informed by global issues affecting product quality, safety, or efficacy; enhanced recognition and reliance upon the regulatory inspec-tions conducted by recognized health authorities, which may reduce the total number of regulatory inspections at any one site but also increase the impact of each inspection. Regardless of which health authority conducts the inspection, the preparation for, and management of, the inspection process is quite similar. Whether it's a surveillance, pre-approval, or for-cause inspection, regulatory inspections are cru-cial activities that affect business success on several levels. PAREXEL advocates the Regulation and Compliance Q&A with David Elder of Strategic Compliance Consulting, PAREXEL International. Elder is a former senior official with FDA David Elder Heads for Science, Hearts for Service.Aptuit People.IN THE FIELD following steps for inspection preparation and management: 1. Establish and maintain systems that ensure sustained compliance with appli-cable laws and regulations. No amount of inspection-specific preparation or train-ing will ensure success if the elements that the health authority inspector will assess do not comply with laws and regulations. Senior managers would be well advised to fully understand and embrace Interna-tional Conference on Harmonization Q10 Pharmaceutical Quality System guideline. 2. Understand the rules that govern inspections. To avoid confusion, anxiety, and some procedural missteps, company personnel should understand the rules under which health authorities must op-erate. Generally, health authorities have the right to enter premises during normal operating hours, review and copy records (including raw data) relating to legal and regulatory requirements, interview com-pany personnel regarding such records and operations, and collect samples. Health authorities should conduct regu-latory inspections in a reasonable and pro-fessional manner and provide feedback on findings during the inspection and more formally at the conclusion of the inspec-tion. Company officials should leverage these sessions to obtain understanding, seek clarification, and correct facts. 3. Establish procedural systems to man- age the health authority's presence on site. Develop an SOP that includes such elements as: who to notify when a health authority arrives on site, who will serve as the primary liaison for the company (and a back-up), what will be the process for prompt retrieval of requested records, how will requests and issues be communicated to key personnel within the company, who will attend the feedback sessions, and what is the company policy regarding photo-graphs and affidavits. 4. Train staff to understand the inspec- tion process, with emphasis on how to effectively answer questions. Key person-nel will always be interviewed during an inspection. Managers and subject matter experts should be prepared to address inquiries but health authorities could eas-ily ask questions of line employees about responsibilities, training, and governing procedures. Understanding and prepar-ing for the inspection will better enable employees to answer questions effectively and truthfully, and reduce their anxiety. 5. Practice: Conduct mock inspections to rehearse systems and assess employee readiness. Mock inspections can familiar-ize employees with the process and may serve to identify compliance issues that need to be addressed before an inspec-tion takes place. Exercise the inspection management system regularly and the inspection itself will inevitably deliver better outcomes.

From this 3PL, we supply many regional distributors in other countries. The unusual thing is that, 3PL is a virtual affiliate. We have no in-country employ-ees. None of the affiliate officers spend more than a few hours a month on af-filiate affairs. Our quality person resides in the US, and handles all the release and review activities from here as only a part of his job. So far, it has worked.\" Catch the train \"I don't know who develops our products sometimes,\" our GMP Agent-In-Place complained. \"We have some very com-plex products that are not easy to use. One is a kit with four components; two are diluents, and the other two are freeze-dried materials. The process is to recon-stitute the two freeze-dried components first using the diluents provided; and then, with a double-syringe apparatus, administer the product. The double sy-ringe is used to mix the two reconstituted materials at the last second. With this complexity, we receive many complaints. Because redeveloping the product would take years, we sent our experts to the cus-tomers and trained them in the product use. Our complaints dropped by 50%. While this seems like great news, when you start with hundreds of complaints per year, cutting them by half still leaves you with more than you care to handle. \"In other cases, with some simpler products, we found that proper training materials helped enormously,\" our Agent continued. \"We have made training video tapes for a couple of products which have reduced our complaints. Some of the vid-eos have been translated into many lan-guages, including Cantonese.\" Thanks a million \"Our 3PL received a shipment from our manufacturing site late in the day,\" began our GMP Agent-In-Place. \"I should note that at that time we shipped all of our products in refrigerated trucks (2-8 \u00b0C), including our room-temperature prod-ucts. This procedure saved on freight expenses. In this case, all but one of the pallets on the truck were room-tempera-ture products. The 3PL didn't notice that the last pallet in the truck was a different product that required refrigerated storage, and since it was late, they quickly stored all of the pallets in the 'incoming material' area of their ambient temperature ware-house. The next morning, they realized they had left out the refrigerated product over night, so they called us, clearly upset. They had looked up the commercial value of the product and found that the pallet was worth more than $1 million, and that they were on the hook for it. Luckily for them, we had stability data to support a short excursion at room temperature on this product, so it was usable after all. The 3PL ultimately made some changes in their processing, but the biggest change was one that we made in separating the refrigerated products from the room-temperature products and shipping them separately.\" Calculating the loss \"Back in the 1970s, the high-end calcula-tors we used in the laboratories cost more than $100,\" our GMP Agent-In-Place reminisced. \"Items this costly met the company's standard for capital items, so they were tracked. Being a frugal com-pany, there was an annual survey of each department's capital items, and each item had to have its location verified. The loca-tion was entered onto a form and then into the computer system. But it's easy to see that calculators are easy to move around, and many times they would be tossed in a drawer and forgotten, or picked up and taken home. In these cases, the manager was chastised for their negligence in the capital loss.

Now, a surge i n overseas production of FDA-regulate d products is driving major changes i n how the agency does business. Death s due to adulterated heparin from Chin a in 2008 jolted the regulators into action . FDA ramped up foreign inspections an d opened its first foreign offices . That crisis, along with evidence o f economically motivated drug adul - teration, widespread drug counterfeit - ing, and extended supply chains tha t aggravated drug shortages at home , prompted FDA to recognize the nee d for further changes in agency opera - tions. FDA Commissioner Margare t Hamburg responded by issuing a spe - cial report last year on the \"Pathwa y to Global Product Safety and Quality \" that outlines four main strategies fo r fundamentally revising FDA's approac h to ensuring product safety and qualit y in a world of international outsourc - ing and soaring imports. The subse - quent report on \"Global Engagement \" describes more specifically how FD A will seek to regulate food, drugs, an d medical products through internationa l collaboration and information sharing . These documents reflect the realit y that FDA will never have the resource s to inspect every foreign producer o f food and medical products or to mon - itor the growing volume of product s crossing US borders. Thus, FDA of - ficials seek to work more closely wit h their regulatory counterparts to redu ce redundant plant inspections and ex - tend regulatory oversight . In addition, Hamburg restructure d FDA 's leadership last year by creatin g four overarching directorates to man - age main program areas. These direc - torates include the new Office of Globa l Regulatory Operations and Policy , headed by Deputy Commissioner Deb - orah Autor. She is in charge of FDA' s Office of International Programs (OIP) , which manages the agency's foreign of - fices and deals with international trade , policy and regulatory issues, and th e Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) , which operates FDA's 4400-perso n field force that inspects manufacturers , clinical researchers, and food producer s in the US and overseas . An attorney who has been a litigato r in the Department of Justice and previ - ously headed the Office of Complianc e in FDA's Center for Drug Evaluatio n and Research, Autor is well positione d to take on the challenge of transformin g FDA into a more data-driven, strategic , collaborative operation.

For example, imports of FDA regulate d products have quadrupled over th e course of a 10-year period, rising fro m 6 million to 24 million import lines.

That production changed fundamentally over time, and the agency needs to adjust accordingly. One of the major steps is the Global Pathway report, with its four pillars: forming global coalitions of regulators to strengthen the product safety net around the world; developing global data systems for sharing information across markets; using advanced risk analytics and modernizing IT capabili-ties; and leveraging the combined ef-forts of public and private third parties. It recognizes that we can't do it all, and that we have to be smarter and more information-driven and more technology-driven. We have to learn to rely on others because it will never be possible for FDA to have enough resources to be everywhere, to see ev-erything, to do everything. When we talk about global coalitions and global data, I think that we would like to get to a point where we really are able to have inspectional reports from inspectorates around the globe, and we're able to share our inspection reports so that we can work with our counterparts to leverage resources. PharmTech: How does this affect bio- pharmaceutical manufacturers? Autor: Industry needs to ensure that it has done everything it can to assume responsibility for its supply chains, for its component suppliers, for its own production around the world. It comes down to companies really un-derstanding what they're making and what they're buying and how they can best ensure product safety and quality. PharmTech: What changes have been made at FDA? Autor: At around the same time that we issued the Pathway report, the Com-missioner reorganized FDA. She estab-lished four directorates\u2014the Director-ate of Foods and Veterinary Medicine, the Directorate of Medical Products and Tobacco, the Operations Director-ate run by our Chief Operating Offi-cer, and my Directorate, called Global Regulatory Operations and Policy. My mandate is to implement the Pathway report, to ensure that FDA fully inte-grates its domestic and international programs to best promote and protect public health, and to make import safety and globalization a top priority in the years to come. My directorate includes OIP, which leads, manages, and coordinates FDA's global engagement work, including our 13 foreign posts. In addition, the Direc-torate includes ORA, which provides FDA leadership on imports, inspec-tions, and enforcement. My job is to take all of those resources and align them against our global challenges. I think, for example, that we ought to be treating like risks in equivalent ways regardless of where they're located. So a sterile drug facility in China should not be getting a different level of regulatory over-sight than a sterile drug facility in Chi-cago. If you look at reports from the Gov-ernment Accountability Office (GAO), you'll see that our inspection coverage on the foreign side is not nearly as frequent as our inspection coverage on the domestic side. Now, I don't think that means that in the future we inspect everybody equally all the time. But we should have equal as-surance of safety and quality regardless of where the product comes from. And that can involve using our own inspections or data from our counterparts, or third-party coverage, or any other means that we can come up with. It's an interesting challenge because, as I said, we are a domestic organiza-tion. My directorate includes 4400 peo-ple in ORA, pretty much all domestic; and less than 100 people in OIP dedi-cated to international work. PharmTech: Does this mean that ORA will be shifting more inspectors overseas? Autor: We're not necessarily spreading all our people around the globe, but we need to figure out how to use our resources to make sure that we have the best coverage of all of our global risks. It's about strategic and risk-based global industry oversight. We need to be gathering data and infor-mation, analyzing it, identifying risks, and devising targeted, tailored, strategic approaches that are flexible, that address those specific risks. Those approaches can be anything from inspections, to enforcement, to in-centives, to education and training. We need to implement those strategies, to see what works, and continue to learn and improve. Inspections are a signifi-cant part of it, but certainly not all of it. There also is a lot of work to be done in gathering information about emerg-ing risks, whether it's product quality defects or problematic environmental trends. It could be almost anything that helps us understand more fully the breadth of the risks and how to inter-vene. Right now we, and a lot of regu-lators, have very operational models of doing business. We go out on the ground and see what we find, and then we figure out what to do about it. That's important, but information can help us know, in advance, what the challenges are, what the risks are, and what the op-portunities are.

The only way to re-ally address it is to be as strategic and risk-based and leveraged as possible. PharmTech: During the heparin crisis, for example, would more timely infor-mation on the pig virus have alerted FDA and industry to be on the lookout for adulterated product?Autor: Yes, both industry and FDA need to be more aware of red flags for emerging risks. In the heparin situation, there was a virus killing pigs in China that caused a shortage of heparin and rising prices. We know from history that when there's strong demand, diminished supply, and high prices, that is an opportunity for criminals to step in. So we need to be smarter about looking for those kinds of things. That ap-plies to regulators, but it also means that industry should be paying attention to what's going on in their markets; looking at procurement of components is a very important aspect of business. PharmTech: Do manufacturers do enough to ensure product quality? Autor: What I hear from the phar- maceutical industry is that the quality side and the supply side aren't always connected. So you have someone who is out buying components, and they're just looking for a slightly less expensive supplier. But they may not take into ac-count the full range of costs associated with a less expensive component. Often a component may be cheaper to buy, but it may be made at a facility far away, which is harder to really have a han-dle on from a quality perspective. It may be that, in fact, that component could cause a serious product quality problem, which ultimately could cost the company much, much, much more money than it ever saved by knocking a penny or two off the price of the component. PharmTech: Do you think industry is getting this message? Autor: I think there have been a lot of good efforts underway recently. For example, I think Rx-360 [the interna-tional pharmaceutical supply chain consortium] is a great way for industry to work together to share information, both about specific suppliers and about emerging risks and issues. My view is that there is a range of companies. There are some that, frankly, I think are still not as proactive about quality as they could be. There are some companies that really do constantly as-pire to best practices, there are others that don't, and then there are some in between. What I often hear in those situ-ations is that there may be people in the quality units who are very vocal propo-nents of this, but they may not always get the attention and the resources they need from high levels of the companies. Other industries\u2014aerospace, auto- motive\u2014have really grappled with the challenges of globalization and out-sourcing and put in systems that aren't necessarily replicated in the pharma-ceutical industry.

It really starts at the very beginning in understanding your process and your product, and goes on to understanding your suppliers and your supply chain. Ultimately, some of the risks [from producing low quality drugs] are just devastating, as with the incidence of glass particles in vials of injectable drugs. That cost industry at least $250 million. As I understand it, glass production processes can make the glass vulnerable to this dam-age, and a lot of very expensive injectable products had to be recalled. And the hepa-rin crisis cost Baxter at least $30 million in sales and $4.7 billion in market capitaliza-tion. So these can be really devastating. PharmTech: Will regulatory collabora- tions address some of these issues? Autor: I would like to make sure that we are being strategic and cohesive glob-ally in addressing criminal threats to the drug supply. Whether it's counterfeiting or cargo theft or economically motivated adulteration, I think there's a real oppor-tunity to make sure that we take a holis-tic look. We need to make sure that the civil side out there monitoring facilities and the criminal side catching criminals are talking so that we're able to both pun-ish crime\u2014and also prevent and detect crime by building stronger regulatory safeguards and by telling industry what the risk might be and how to be proactive in protecting itself from potential risks. PharmTech: Another proposal is to do more to leverage third parties for conducting inspections. This has not been a big success at FDA so far, so is it still promising? Autor: It is true that the agency hasn't always had perfect results in relying on private third parties for inspections, but I think that there is real potential there. We are further ahead in our exploration with respect to devices and foods, but I think we've got what we need to get there on the drug side as well. This ap-proach creates some real challenges, and we need to be frank about those and to figure out how to overcome them. For regulators, it's hard to let go and to let someone else help us. But given the realities of globalization, we just can't do it alone. If we can work with others, if we can let go of control to some extent, we will have many more resources at our dis-posal. We shouldn't walk into this blind to the downsides, but it is possible, and I believe we can get there. What I hear from the pharmaceutical industry is that the quality side and the supply side aren't always connected.

Is that a realistic approach? Autor: I believe that we need to look for 'mutual reliance.' That means sufficient comfort with each other's standards to be willing to rely on work done by a counterpart. We don't necessarily need to go the whole way to mutual recognition agreements. I hope, over time, that regulatory standards globally will converge, something that is already happening. As we work together, we all learn from each other. PharmTech: That IOM report also mentioned the Secure Supply Chain pilot program and greater use of low-cost technologies to oversee imports. What role can those play? Autor: The Secure Supply Chain is a pilot project that aims to facilitate imports from companies and facilities where we have a certain level of assurance. It is in the process of moving forward and presents a risk-based concept: If you can know that certain imports are low risk, then you don't have to devote much time to them. We also see opportunities to utilize more low-cost technolo- gies in dealing with imports and supply chain security. One example is employing hand-held laboratory devices at the bor-der. And in Africa there's use of a scratch-off number on a drug package that you can text in and find out if the drug is authen-tic. Manufacturers also are using barcode technology on brand name clothing or handbags and a call-in system to learn if the product is legitimate or not. I understand that certain large chain stores have RFID tags on underwear, so it seems that there's po-tential for pharmaceuticals. PharmTech: There's another IOM report coming on counterfeit drugs; what is its focus? Autor: We asked IOM to address the gaps globally in dealing with SSFFC drugs\u2014substandard, spurious, falsely-labeled, falsi-fied, and counterfeit products. How can countries and other stake-holders come together to really ensure that we are doing the best job we can in dealing with those products? Often that discussion gets mired in intellectual property issues. PharmTech: Should we be looking for more reports on globaliza- tion from your office and more FDA foreign offices? Autor: I think our job now is to bring the current program to life. I don't think we know, at this point, exactly what our global presence will be over time. Our foreign offices have been key to enhancing our effectiveness overseas, helping us to know our counterparts, to understand them, to gather information about emerging issues, and to be there when we need to jump in and do an inspection quickly. We may get additional money in the 2013 budget for more in- spectors in China for food and drugs. And if the Generic Drug User Fee Act is enacted, we will have a lot of responsibilities to expand foreign inspections and will need to take a hard look at how we can meet those. At the moment, we don't have any con-crete plans to open new offices, but over time, we'll have to see what we need to do. PharmTech: How will FDA be different in 5 to 10 years? Autor: I believe that we will be more data driven, more risk- based, more strategic, more leveraged. We will be collaborating with our counterparts in global coalitions, we will be using data and advanced risk analytics, and we will be working closely with public and private third parties. The combination of difficult economic times and quantum leaps in globalization will drive us towards being smarter and more effective and leveraged. I think that we will recognize that, given the challenges we and our counterparts all face, we can no longer afford duplicative regulatory programs; we need to find ways to work together as much as possible.

But given the realities of globalization, we just can't do it alone. \u00a9 2012 PerkinElmer, Inc. 400248_01. All rights reserved.

Almost four years after the global financial crisis first hit, venture-capital returns are under pressure, and capital remains scarce for most precom-mercial biotechnology companies. And as Big Pharma's biggest products go off patent, these firms face a more resource- constrained future. Tremendously creative approaches to boost R&D productivity have emerged in the last few years, but these do not address the fundamental changes necessary to fuel the leaps in productivity and efficiency that are needed. Features of open learning networks In Ernst & Young's recently released re-port on the state of the biotechnology industry, Beyond Borders , we propose a model to address the limitations of cur-rent drug R&D: the holistic open learning network (HOLNet). At their core, these networks of diverse organizations would enable information-sharing and real-time learning from across the healthcare eco-system. The divisions between the R&D and commercial ends of the value chain would become increasingly blurred. The four key characteristics of a successful HOLNet are described below. Holistic. The HOLNet approach repre- sents a vastly different and inclusive ap-proach to R&D that blurs the boundaries between drug development, product com-mercialization, and healthcare delivery. Rather than being confined to the tradi-tional siloed and sequential approach to drug development, HOLNets would share vast and diverse amounts of data and con-nect dots across the entire value chain of companies (from early research to mar-keting) and cycle of care of patients (from prevention to cure). Open . To break down traditional silos, HOLNets will involve more open ap-proaches to data. Members will pool their strengths and assets, including talent and \"precompetitive\" data. To varying degrees, these networks also will openly share re-sulting output. This feature is one of the most powerful aspects of a HOLNet: mak-ing R&D more efficient and productive by reducing redundant expenditures and al-lowing researchers to learn from each oth-er's insights and mistakes. This sharing will inevitably raise concerns about intellectual property, but firms also recognize that in some situations, sharing information may create more value than protecting it. Learning. HOLNets are about learning rapidly, in real time, by connecting data from across the ecosystem. Real-time learning allows constituents to quickly ad-just their approaches, save time and money, and increase success rates. Network. Reinventing R&D and unleash- ing the transformative potential of big data requires the participation of diverse players from across the ecosystem. Such a network needs a common goal around which all its members are aligned. While all entities do not need to do the same thing, they do need to be pulling in the same direction. Open learning networks in action HOLNets build on trends already vis-ible in the market and, more impor-tantly, involve learning from beyond the life-sciences industry and leverag-ing the strengths of a diverse range of entities\u2014from providers and patient groups to social media networks and data analytics firms. HOLNets could truly transform how insights are gathered and new drugs are developed. For example, they could: t\u0001 Encourage data sharing in precom- petitive spaces (e.g., genetic data from patients, claims data from payers, outcomes data from providers' elec-tronic health-record systems, data on failed clinical trials from life-sciences companies, and insights from disease foundations) t\u0001 Create uniform standards for data for combining and studying holistically t\u0001 Engage with regulators for new R&D approaches and clinical-trial design t\u0001 Engage with patients in more en- during relationships and use richer real-time patient data (with informed patient consent) to inform drug R&D. HOLNets could provide many addi- tional advantages to biotechnology com-panies and their investors. As part of such a consortium, biotechnology firms would gain insights from other members, in-cluding into unsuccessful target selection and clinical-trial design. They also may gain access to regulators in a way that an individual company would be unlikely to achieve, particularly important at a time of greater regulatory uncertainty and risk. The challenges associated with estab- lishing a HOLNet are not to be minimized given the many competing constituencies and interests in the healthcare ecosystem, but the benefits are clear. The HOLNet has the potential to be a boldly different para-digm that seizes the opportunities latent in the changing healthcare ecosystem: big data, real-time insights, and the diverse strengths of a wide range of players.

Gautam JaggiA New R&D ParadigmEVENT OVERVIEW A recent survey by Pharmaceutical Technology polled drug-development professionals on the leading problems facing them in their current proj-ects. Eighty-nine percent of respondents cited bioavailability as either \"signicant\" or \"very signicant, \" with solubility (86%) following closely behind. Recent studies claim that as many as 70% of new investigational drugs suffer from poor aqueous solubility. Poor solubility and bioavailability prevent drugs from achieving clinically meaningful plasma concentrations, leading to lengthy and more costly development programs. Conventional formulation strategies for BCS Class II and IV compounds rely on improv-ing solubility by reducing particle size or by formulating with excipients designed to enhance in-vivo solubilization. This 90-minute webcast will examine advances in lipid-based drug delivery systems (LBDDS) for enhancing the bioavailability of absorption-limited small and large molecules. Strategies for addressing the challenges posed by these drugs will be discussed, such as: designing formulations to maintain drug solubility, increase permeability, target lymphatic trans-port, bypass rst pass metabolism, and mitigate food effects as well as in-vitro methodologies that can be used to predict their in-vivo perfor- mance. Given LBDDS are most often delivered orally using softgel tech-nology, this webcast will also discuss the manufacture of softgels and recent advances in softgel technology which include Vegicaps\u00ae capsules.

Plackett and J.P. Burman, at the University of Newcastle in northeast England in 1946 (1). Looking back to an original article published by Plackett and Burman, the authors note: \"A problem that often occurs in the design of an experiment in physical or industrial research is that of de-termining suitable tolerances for the components of a certain assembly; more generally of ascertaining the ef-fect of quantitative or qualitative al-terations in the various components upon some measured characteristic of the complete assembly. It is some-times possible to calculate what this effect should be; but it is to the more general case when this is not so that the methods given below apply\" (1). This statement is interesting for several reasons. First, there was little published in 1946 using experimentation for industrial research. The researchers were ahead of their time. Second, they were studying the tolerances for a mechanical assembly. Most experimentation at the time was for crops and livestock. Third, they were empirically determining tolerance stack up in the me-chanical assembly rather than trying to calculate it. Lastly, they published this in-dustry oriented paper in a biology journal. Needless to say, the paper didn't get a lot of attention at the time. The most popular text for designed experiments at the time didn't include PB designs (2). Even the most famous of books on experimentation, by Box, Hunter and Hunter, devoted less than a page to the topic and then only noted the statistical characteristics without any suggestions for application (3). (The latter edition in 2005 included a chapter on PB.) PB designs can be at two, three, five, and seven levels. In practice, the two and three levels are primarily used. The numbers of factors to be evaluated are one less than the number of runs or trials in the study. De-signs do not exist for all number of runs. The original paper published 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 ... 96 and 100 runs. Thus, it is possible to study 7 factors in 8 runs, 11 factors in 12 runs, or even 99 factors in 100 runs. One could make the case that PB de- signs are the step-child of designed experi-ments. They are recognized as being an ex-cellent way to study many factors in very few runs or experiments. But, historically, statisticians are taught to find and estimate the main effects and the two-factor inter-action in a given experiment. PB designs, however, are sparse (an advantage), and confound the main effects and two-factor interactions (a disadvantage), such that nei-ther can be estimated separately. At which point, some say, why do this? PB designs were originally proposed for testing tolerances of simple mechani-cal assemblies. Using these designs, many combinations could be studied in a rela-tively few number of runs or trials. This mechanical situation did not have any in-teractions between parts to be considered. However, once published, other industrial applications were found. PB designs did not enjoy a lot of popu- larity until the early 1980s when a new em-phasis on quality swept the nation under the term \"T otal Quality Management\" (TQM). As part of that movement, PB de- signs were recognized as a way to screen many factors in a few number of trials. Some statisticians were still bothered by the inability to study the interactions but, pragmatically, it was a reasonable tradeoff. In recent years, the designs have been used in the early stages of quality by de-sign to define design space, as indicated in the International Conference on Harmo-nization's Q8 Pharmaceutical Development guideline. It is also reasonable to use PB de-signs for these assumptions and situations: t\u0001 When there are a large number of fac- tors to screen to eliminate unimport-ant ones. This use assumes that factors that seem to be important are due to a large main effect and not interactions. t\u0001 When it is reasonable to assume that most or all of the two factor interac-tions do not exist or are small. t\u0001 When one wants to demonstrate rug- gedness or robustness of equipment or processes (4). This use assumes that the factors used are not critical and the study is to demonstrate that. t\u0001 When one wants to find a set of condi- tions that performs better than those being used and when empirical rela-tionships are not a concern.

Pharmaceutical Technol- ogy spoke to leading scientists, equipmen t y manufacturers, and senior production ex- ecutives to gain their perspectives. Offering insight on solid-dosage manufacturin g are Chris Moreton, PhD, vice-president of pharmaceutical sciences at FinnBrit Con-sulting and a member of the Pharmaceuti- cal Technology Editorial Advisory Board; Charles Kettler, PhD, director of NatoliScientific, a division of Natoli Engineering;and from Pfizer, Axel Knoch, senior direc - tor and team leader of product and process development; Cynthia Oksanen, direc- tor, PharmaTherapeutics R& D; and John Groskoph, senior director, global chemistr y manufacturing and controls. Providing perspectives on sterile manufacturing are James Agalloco, president of Agalloco & Associates and a member of th e Phar- maceutica l Technology Editoria l Advisor y y Board; Ryan Hawkins, vice-president an d chief operating officer at Cook Pharmica;and Bernd Stauss, vice-president of produc-tion & PharmTech : What wou ld you i dentify as : the most significant advances in solid dos-age manufacturing in the past 10 years ? Kettler (Natoli): The evolution of new formulation techniques that allow poorly soluble molecules to press forward as po-tentially effective treatments for patients is a significant advance. Moreton (FinnBrit ): There have been : several incremental advances, such asimprovements in cleaning, which allow shorter changeover times when switchin g to another product, and developments in sensor technology for granulation, blend-ing, and compaction. However, traditional batch processing is very inefficient because the equipment is idle for significant peri - ods of time. The most significant advances, therefore, have been in beginning to apply continuous manufacturing methods. Oksanen (Pfizer): The main ad- vances have involved the application of advanced materials science and en-gineering tools to enable greater un - derstanding and heightened control o f existing unit operations. Measurementsof the material properties of APIs an d excipients are now routinely applied tothe design of manufacturing processesto enrich understanding of potentia l sources of variability. Computationa l models for pharmaceutical processing have made significant advances in mod-eling powder mixing, spray drying, an d tablet coating. The application of processanalytical technology (PAT) has enabled heightened control of these unit opera- tions and the ability to adjust for varia-tions in material properties. PharmTech: What will be the influence o f quality by design (QbD) on solid-dosage manufacturing in the years ahead ? Kettler (Natoli): As the reviewers and inspectors for regulatory agencies begin to get more comfortable with the concept o f design space, they will know how to rapidly review submissions and query the submit-ter directly about design space definition, robustness, and process capability of equip-ment. Ultimately, if the agencies can retainsufficient numbers of experienced person-nel for review and inspection, the QbD process can hasten the decision process instead of being a barrier. Moreton (FinnBrit): The influence of QbD will eventually be enormous. Some companies already understand the poten-tial benefits and are working towards it.Others will be forced into it by virtue of the questions FDA will raise if they do not include QbD elements in their new drug or abbreviated drug (NDA, ANDA) submis-sion. QbD has the potential to improve the supply of drugs eventually. By definition, if we have undertaken our QbD develop-ment program properly and asked all the relevant questions, we should be develop-ing more robust products. Groskoph (Pfizer): From its start, QbD has delivered more robust processes into the manufacturing environment. Regu- latory and operational flexibility (i.e., the ability to make changes without regula-tory action), however, have been difficult to achieve. We do see a shift in the approac h towards reducing or eliminating the focus on design space and increasing the focus on control strategy. This opens the door to apply the tools of QbD to existing products where significant manufacturing experi-ence can replace proactive developmental knowledge but achieve the same result o f reduced variability of the end product. Knoch (Pfizer): We have learned ho w to implement process parameter changesin routine manufacturing in order to op-timize yield and robustness. As a global company, we are challenged by the fact that the QbD approach is not yet accepted inevery country, and companies still have to run QbD and conventional filings in paral- lel. With time, this hopefully will change. PharmTech: Do you see solid-dosage manufacturing moving towards continu-ous processes ?

Some companies have proven that real-time release can be a real-ity. The companies that comprehend the need to develop continuous, controllable processes for pharmaceutical manufac-turing by using QbD and advanced con-trol techniques will harvest the rewards that come from running capable processes that can be operated by far fewer personnel and turned around faster than in the past. Costly deviations and lost batches will be-come events of yesteryear, and the level of regulatory oversight for these companies will fall to a level that will allow the in-spectorate to spend its time overseeing the companies that continue to follow paths of greater risk. Moreton (FinnBrit): I do think true continuous manufacturing\u2014in which starting materials with predefined speci-fications are fed continuously and prod-uct is continually produced and removed from the process\u2014is possible and can be achieved. Issues to be resolved include traceability in the event of a recall, con-tamination or adulteration of starting components, procedures for start-up and shut-down, and ways to deal with the in-herent variability of the starting compo-nents. An interesting point is that many of the excipients used in the manufacture of pharmaceutical tablets and capsules are manufactured by true continuous manu-facturing where the equipment is operated continuously 24 hours per day and seven days a week. These issues have been re-solved for these materials, so why shouldn't they be from the ef-ficiency and throughput improvements de-livered by continuous processes. However, at the current time, we are seeing a trend towards smaller volume products due, in part, to our focus on personalized medi-cines. One key to effective manufacture of small-volume products is the development of flexible modular manufacturing units that can be quickly assembled anywhere. These units will have some of the aspects of continuous processing (especially where it improves robustness), but will be more flexible for multiple small volume products. PharmTech: What may be the most sig- nificant advances of the next 5-10 years? Kettler (Natoli): As the QbD mantra rises in volume, the use of PAT will in-crease in order to acquire more molecu-lar and process information earlier in the development process. PAT generates large volumes of data and can be implemented on most drug-product unit operations. The institutions and individuals capable of managing this mountain of information and turning it into knowledge will gain a competitive advantage by learning to bring molecules to the clinic faster and being pre-pared to manufacture the final drug prod-uct at a lower cost. In five years, this will be a common practice for perhaps 10% of the pharmaceutical industry. In 10 years, there will be new measurement techniques that will come to bear on every one of the solid-dosage unit operations. These mea-surements will provide new insight into powder formulation, powder handling, and powder compaction processes. This new knowledge will offer the committed manufacturer the opportunity to design more processes based on first principles and the confidence that they can reach the end in mind with a minimum of experi-mental work to validate their design. Oksanen (Pfizer): In the next five years, current research in API particle engineering will result in better control of API properties, enabling the use of simpler direct-compression processes for downstream drug-product processing. Within the next 10 years, the focus will be on technologies that improve efficiency in R&D and production. The development of flexible, modular manufacturing platforms for solid-dosage manufacturing will reduce the experimentation needed for technology transfer, getting drugs to market faster. Knoch (Pfizer): The trend towards local manufacturing on a market-by-market basis is likely to drive demand for highly standardized, modular manu-facturing units at medium-size scale and the flexibility to ensure manufacture of high quality product at any site with only limited operator input. Advanced process control will also play a bigger role. We will no longer just measure online intermedi-ate and product attributes but will use feedback loops to optimize process pa-rameters and product quality online. Ten years from now, the proportion of solid dosage forms will have decreased, and parenteral dosage forms of biotech prod-ucts will play a bigger role.

Pharmaceutical Technology JULY 2012 43 Sterile manufacturing PharmTech: What would you identify as the most significant advances in parenteral manufacturing in the past 10 years? Agalloco: The single most important change in parenteral manufacturing has to be the maturation of isolation tech-nology. Ten years ago there was still a lot of trepidation re-garding isolators; it wasn't clear to the industry that expected operational advantages would overcome their added com-plexity. With the passage of time, we've better understood decontamination practices, defined realistic leak testing criteria, and most importantly gained sufficient operating experience. In addition, quantifiable cost benefits are now well documented, so perhaps the last hurdle to isolators in-creased adoption has now been cleared. We're starting to see the next generation of isolators emerge that provide even greater sophistication and performance. That wouldn't have been possible without the success we've witnessed in the last decade with this technology. Hawkins (Cook): Decontamination cycles for barrier iso- lator technology are significantly shorter today. While cycles were 12-16 hours in the past, they are now 2-4 hours for equivalent isolator size. We also have conquered the learning curve of how to get things in and out of isolators and improved the ergonomics. We have met the goals of removing the risk of human contamination and having a validatable cleaning cycle. Automation has helped industry remove the need for human intervention. For example, it wasn't long ago that we manually fed nested syringe tubs onto the line and manually removed lids and liners, but today these steps are commonly fully automatic. Another advance of just the past few years is that use of dis- posables has gone from talk to action and is yielding significant savings in cleaning and time for set-up and tear-down. Figure 2: Industry roundtable participants, from left to right: James Agalloco, president of Agalloco & Associates and a member of the Pharmaceutical Technology Editorial Advisory Board; Ryan Hawkins, vice-president and chief operating officer at Cook Pharmica; and Bernd Stauss, vice-president of production & engineering at Vetter. 44 Pharmaceutical Technology JULY 2012 PharmTech.com SPECIAL ANNIVERSARY SECTION: MANUFACTURING Stauss (Vetter): The most important advance has been the increase in steril-ity in product manufacturing. New tech-nology\u2014such as isolators and restricted access barrier systems (RABS)\u2014and conceptual approaches to manufactur-ing have significantly reduced the need for direct human contact with the prod-uct, thus reducing this key risk factor. Because of comprehensive automation in peripheral areas (e.g., transport and freeze dryer loading/unloading), man-ual interventions in aseptic production are kept to an absolute minimum. Au-tomated cleanroom sanitization and the increased use of more complex dispos-able systems (e.g., filling pumps) contrib-ute to reliable sterility. Fully automated visual inspection now allows for steady and high-level testing standards for mil-lions of units. All combined, the continu-ing automation in parenteral manufac-turing has allowed for a notable increase in quality and safety of drugs. PharmTech: What may be the most sig- nificant advances of the next 5-10 years? Agalloco: Single-use disposables, which simplify set-up, cleaning, and system integ-rity, will become more prevalent. A gradual shift from glass to plastic containers will virtually eliminate breakage, avoid delami-nation and glass particles, reduce shipping costs, and lower utility costs, among other potential benefits. The next generation of filling equipment will operate in isolators with internal automation and robotics that will essentially eliminate the need for human intervention. contin. on page 58 The Novartis-MIT Center for Continuous Manufacturing envisions a fully integrated process that starts with raw materials and produces a finished product in a completely continuous process. The center has a functioning prototype that is designed to demonstrate end-to-end continuous manufacturing, from forming the API through to coated tablets. \"Last fall we achieved our goal of running this process and now are working on fully integrating the control system,\" says Bernhardt Trout, PhD, director of the center. \"The control system involves physically-based mathematical models of all the parts of the process integrated together. The control system will automate the process as a whole, which is a big step toward continuous manufacturing. A benefit of the continuous process is significantly reduced throughput time, and with that comes cost sav ings. We also see an increase in quality, because what we're doing is r eally quality by design.\" Process analytical technology (PAT) is also a major aspect of the center's research and is one component of the broader vision of continuous manufacturing, says Trout. \"In our prototype, we are learning how to apply PAT and use it as a research tool. In a commercial system, PAT would be implemented together with the models that are being developed and with the control system in order to automate the process and obtain optimal specifications for quality,\" he explains. To listen to the full interview with Dr. Trout on continuous manufacturing, go to PharmTech.com/PodcastsContinuous manufacturing: Integrated API and solid-dosage manufacturing Continuous manufacturing is the way of the future and many are involved in its development. \"In the last three to four years, continuous manufacturing has become a focus for the larger pharma companies,\" says Fernando Muzzio, PhD, director of the Engineering Research Center for Structured Organic Particulate Systems (C -SOPS), professor in the Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering at Rutgers University, and a member of the Pharmaceutical Technology Editorial Advisory Board. \"We also see some of the smaller, branded pharma companies and some of the larger generics starting in this area. Smaller generics are not yet there, but I think it is just a matter of time.\" C -SOPS brings together a cross-section of engineers, scientists, and industry leaders from academia, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and equipment manufacturers. Many of the C -SOPS projects involve continuous manufacturing, such as modeling of continuous powder feeding, roller compaction, granulatio n, and tableting. In the pharma industry today, some unit operations (e.g., compression, capsule filling, extrusion, and milling) are intrinsically continuous, but are run in batch mode by defining a blend batch and running it through what is essentially a continuous process, notes Muzzio. Other unit operations (e.g., continuous mixing) are established and ready to move forward, while still other operations need more development work to move forward. \"In continuous wet granulation, for example, even though there is commercial equipment available, there is more work to do before it becomes a reliable and robust process. In continuous coating all the major equipment companies have been working on the operation, \" says Muzzio. \"Once we have the technology deployed in multiple places and people become familiar with various ways to implement and begin to enjoy the advantages of doing it this way, I'm sure we'll find more and more applications. My estimate is that the great majority of the commodity and large volume, branded products are going to be done continuously five to ten years from now because the technical advantages are ov erwhelming and the cost advantages are significant,\" says Muzzio.

PharmTech's reports and special-themed issues have offered invaluable guidance and interpretation to the industry over the years when new standards and guidances are released. Some of the events and issues discussed in this publication have had long-term impact with respect to how the indus-try operates today. This roundup article highlights some of the organizations and key influential events that have shaped the pages of PharmTech and the way our industry works. US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Tamper-resistant packaging regulations (1983). In September 1982, several deaths resulted from cyanide poisoning in Chicago, IL, and its suburban area. The investigation determined that the common denomina-tor between the victims was taking Tyle-nol. Johnson & Johnson, the manufacturer of Tylenol, was ruled out as the source of contamination but on Oct. 5, 1982, the company issued a nationwide recall of an estimated 31 million bottles. This incident prompted the passing of tamper-resistant packaging regulations, which made it a felony to tamper with packaged consumer products. The industry developed stan-dards for tamper-resistant packaging that are still used today. Orphan Drug Act (1983). The Orphan Drug Act was passed in 1983 to encour-age pharmaceutical companies to develop medicines for patients with rare diseases. Companies were given 7 years of exclusiv-ity and tax incentives for pharmaceuticals that qualified for orphan-drug status. This act has lead to the successful treatment of or medical management of diseases such as multiple myeloma and cystic fibrosis. Before this law was passed, there were ap-proximately 38 drugs approved to treat rare diseases. From 1983 to 2010, FDA approved 353 orphan drugs and granted orphan des-ignations to 2116 active compounds. Generic-drug scandal (1989). The generic- drug scandal began when a generic-drug manufacturer submitted a complaint to regulators after experiencing repeated delays in approval of its ANDAs. The complainant charged that FDA was dis-criminating against the generic-drug firm in favor of other companies. Three FDA officials plead guilty to accepting bribes from companies and two companies plead guilty to offering bribes to FDA officials. Ultimately, 13 generic-drug manufacturers were investigated for fraudulent practices and several products were recalled. This incident resulted in an increase in require-ments for ANDA submissions. Today, about 65% of the prescriptions written are 1979 FDA approves the first commercially available prescription patch, target- ing motion sickness. That same year, good laboratory practices are established through 21 CFR Part 58. John Baxter reports cloning the gene for human growth hormone. 1978 Minimum cGMPS for manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding drug products and medical de- vices, and for finished phar- maceuticals, are issued through 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211. 1981 Mary Harper and col- leagues map the gene for insulin. Mapping by in-situ hybridization becomes a standard method. 1980 The US Supreme Court rules that genetically altered life forms can be patented. That same year, researchers successfully introduce a human gene that codes for the protein interferon into a bacterium. Kary Mullis and others at Cetus Corporation invent a technique for multiplying DNA sequences in vitro by the polymerase chain reaction. How FDA, USP , and ICH have redirected industry practiceSusan J. SchnieppThe Transformation of Regulation and Global Standards 1977 Pharmaceutical Technology publishes its first volume. 1983 Jay Levy's lab at UCSF isolates the AIDS virus at almost the same mo- ment it is isolated at the Pasteur Insti- tute in Paris and at NIH. That same year, US Congress amends the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to create the Orphan Drug Act, designed to facilitate the development and commercialization of drugs to treat rare diseases. 1984 The Drug Price Com- petition and Patent Term Restoration Act (Hatch- Waxman Act) is enacted, opening the market for generic drugs. 1982-1983 Tamper-resis- tant packaging regulations are issued for OTC products after related deaths. 1985 NIH approves guidelines for performing experiments in gene ther- apy on humans.46 Pharmaceutical Technology JULY 2012 PharmTech.com SPECIAL ANNIVERSARY SECTION: STANDARDS AND REGULATION 1989 The National Center for Human Genome Research is established to oversee a $3-billion US effort to map and sequence human DNA. 1992 The Generic Drug Enforcement Act is enacted in re- sponse to illegal acts involving abbreviated new drug applications. 1987 Genentech re- ceives FDA approval to market a geneti- cally engineered tis- sue plasminogen ac- tivator to treat heart attacks. That same year, the antidepres- sant drug Prozac en- ters the market. 1990 The Human Genome Project is launched at an esti- mated cost of $13 bil- lion. That same year, the World Health Or- ganization estimates that the global value of pharmaceutical production is US $24.5 billion. 1993 The Biotechnology Industry Or- ganization (BIO) is created by merg- ing two smaller trade associations. Also this year, George Washington University researchers clone human embryos and nurture them in a Petri dish for several days and an interna- tional research team at the Center for the Study of Human Polymorphisms in Paris produces a rough map of all 23 pairs of human chromosomes.for generic-drug products, but it has taken this segment of the industry about two decades to recover from the 1989 scandal. The Barr decision (1991). The Barr decision was the direct result of FDA investigations into questionable quality control practices for the handling of out-of-specification (OOS) results. FDA took Barr Pharma-ceuticals to court for the perceived prac-tice of testing products into compliance. Judge Wolin of the US District Court for the District of New Jersey presided over the proceedings. The result of the Barr decision changed the practice of how manufactur-ers' investigate laboratory results that do not meet specifications, and on how the industry determines whether a product meets it quality attributes. Heparin adulteration (2006-2008). In late 2006, a leading pharmaceutical company recalled several lots of life-saving hepa-rin after receiving numerous reports of adverse events, namely allergic reactions. The company ceased production of the product and began investigating the cause of the incidents. Approximately one month later, FDA issued a Public Health Advisory to the medical community, warning the public and healthcare pro-viders not to use heparin. The company recalled all lots of the product, which was ultimately linked to more than 350 seri-ous adverse reactions and several patient deaths. Contaminated API supplied by a manufacturer in China caused the reac-tions. This incident impacted the industry because it expanded the definition of sup-ply chain and made companies respon-sible for the quality of all the ingredients going back to their root source, which in some cases turned out to be several layers deep. New focus was given to the impor-tance of supplier audits, and several trade organizations began focusing on devel-oping third-party audit capabilities to as-sist the industry in dealing with the vast amount of suppliers sourcing material to the pharmaceutical industry. The inci-dent, for example, spawned a new trade organization, Rx-360, an international supply chain consortium, and redefined the concept of supply chain integrity. Biosimilars guidances (2012). In February 2012, FDA issued three draft guidance doc-uments regarding biosimilars . The agency announced that \"the draft documents are designed to help industry develop biosimi-lar versions of currently approved biologi-cal products, which can enhance competi-tion and may lead to better patient access and lower cost to consumers.\" These doc- uments opened the door to generic-drug products in an area where there has been little competition to innovator products. The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) The US Pharmacopiea (USP) was estab-lished in 1820 and is the oldest continu-ously revised compendia in the world. The standards and information published by USP are recognized as the legal standards by FDA and by regulatory authorities in other countries that have voluntarily ad-opted them. This compendium contains monographs for excipients, APIs, drug products, biologics, biotechnology prod-ucts, general test procedures, and gen-eral information all of which govern the strength, quality, purity, and potency of medicinal products marketed in the US. Monograph harmonization (1989) . USP has a history of impactful events but none have been more significant than its efforts to harmonize monographs with its counter-parts, the European and Japanese Phar-macopoeias ( Ph. Eur. and JP, respectively). The harmonization process began in 1989, when representatives of the three pharma-copeias met with industry representatives in an open forum to discuss the need to 1986 FDA grants a license for the first recombinant vaccine (for hepatitis) to Chiron Corp. That same year, Johnson and Johnson, maker of Tylenol, announces it will no longer sell OTC medications in capsule form, following the death of a woman who had taken a cyanide-laced capsule. 1995 A new gene mapping technique, STS gene mapping, evolves, greatly speeding the work of geneticists involved in the international Human Ge- nome Project. That same year, the US government approves the nation's first varicella vac- cine, Varivax by Merck & Co. 1997 Researchers at Scotland's Roslin In- stitute report that they have cloned a sheep from the cell of an adult ewe. That same year, the new FDA Modernization Act seeks to minimize the differences between how biologics and other drugs are regulated. FDA approves the first inhaled antibiotic, made by PathoGenesis, to help lung func- tion in patients with cystic fibrosis. This timeline is meant to provide highlights of key industry and regulatory events and is not all-inclusive.

That same year, the agency launches the Critical Path Initiative (CPI) to drive innovation in the scientific processes through which medical products are developed, evaluated, and manufactured. 2003 President Bill Clinton announces that his AIDS Foundation clinched a deal to cut drug prices and im-prove care in poor nations. That same year, FDA issues draft guidelines outlining when drug companies must submit information on how drugs affect people differ-ently depending on their genetic makeup. 2005 Wyeth Co. officially opens a $2-billion Irish pro-duction facility, a move that will make the US company the biggest pharmaceutical employer in Ireland. 2001 A new AIDS vaccine is reported to be success-ful in monkeys. In the same year, Bristol Myers Squibb proposes a $1 a day price per patient for its AIDS medications to sub-Saharan African countries. 2000 IMS Health reports that the audited global pharmaceutical market in sales is $32 1 .8 billion. That same year, Governor Angus King signs a bill making Maine the first US state to threaten the phar- maceutical industry with price controls. Victoria Hale founds the Institute for OneWorldHealth, a non- profit to develop drugs for diseases endemic in devel- oping countries. 1998 A rough draft of the human genome map is produced, showing the locations of more than 30,000 genes.harmonize like procedures to reduce the regulatory burden on pharmaceutical companies. Prior to harmonization ef-forts, companies were required to meet the specifications in the governing phar-macopeia for the region of the world where they wanted to market their product. To accomplish this goal, the three phar-macpeias established the Pharmacopeial Discussion Group (PDG) and developed a 7-step process for unifying monograph requirements. Under this model, more than 100 items have been harmonized. The efforts to harmonize monographs continue today. Stakeholder forum (1999) . USP introduced stakeholder forums in 1999, and the events became an officially recognized component of the USP family by vote at the 2005 USP Convention. Stakeholder fo-rums allow for a free interchange of ideas between USP and industry trade organi-zations. The Prescription/NonPrescrip-tion Stakeholder Forum is the most active bi-annual meeting with USP. Among the participating organizations are IPEC, PDA, the Midwestern Compendial Discussion Group, and the Western Compendial Dis-cussion Group. Through PDG, several USP initiatives have been implemented across the industry with little or no disruption to compliance. An example is the collabora-tion to implement the residual solvents standard, which took effect in 2008. Flexible monographs (2004). The phar- maceutical industry has long recognized there is more than one way to synthesize an API and that the impurity profile for the ingredient is dictated by the specific route chosen. To accommodate impurity profiles based on the route of synthesis, USP started adopting multiple impurity methods to ensure all manufacturers of an API or the subsequent dosage form are able to refer-ence the USP standard. These are identi-fied and \"Method 1,\" \"Method 2,\" and so forth in the monograph. This practice has provided pharmaceutical manufacturers flexibility and sourcing alternatives for their products.Globalization efforts (2011-2012). During the past decade, USP has changed its mis-sion statement to indicate that it wishes to \"improve the health of people around the world through public standards and related programs that help ensure the quality, safety, and benefit of medicines and foods.\" Its current vision is \"...to be a leader in promoting the public health by creating a unique knowledge base\u2014con-sisting of quality standards and informa-tion on proper use\u2014for medicines and related products and practices. USP will ensure that people throughout the world have access to this knowledge base.\" USP has opened offices in Switzerland, India, China, and Brazil. In addition, at the USP 2010 Convention, the organization passed Resolution 4, which deals with supporting and advancing global public-health initiatives. USP is also expanding its role in India and China and explor-ing relationships with the Association of Southeast Nations and Middle East and North African nations. 2007 An FDA advisory panel con- cludes that OTC cold and cough medi-cines may not be safe or effective for children under age 6. Companies be-gin to recall and relabel related prod-ucts. That same year, China's SFDA former chief Zheng Xiaoyu is executed for corruption. The US and China sign two deals to safeguard the quality of food and drugs. FDA releases its Ac- tion Plan for Import Safety. 2006 IMS Health coins the term \"pharmerging mar-kets\" including China, Bra-zil, Mexico, India, Russia, South Korea, and Turkey. By 2010, IMS has 17 countries on this list.Pharmaceutical Technology JULY 2012 49 SPECIAL ANNIVERSARY SECTION: STANDARDS AND REGULATION The International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) In this author's opinion, the establishment of ICH has had the most influence on the pharmaceutical industry. The first ICH meeting was held in 1990 and the body of work produced by this organization and its impact on the industry is staggering. ICH's work has changed our language and established global stability requirements, and GMPs for APIs, and laid the founda-tion for the modern quality system. ICH Q2 Validation of Analytic Procedures (1994). This document established validation re-quirements for analytical tests, including identifications, quantitative impurities, controlled impurities, and active moiety. It standardized industry terminology for the various parameters needed for valida-tion, including definitions for specificity, accuracy, precision, repeatability, linearity, robustness, and reproducibility. The EU, MHLW, and FDA adopted the document and it continues to define how the industry approaches analytical methods validation.ICH Q7 GMP Guide for APIs (2000). This doc- ument provided the first comprehensive GMPs for APIs. It touched on everything from the necessary quality management to personnel qualifications to the design and construction of the buildings and fa-cilities. Adopted by the EU, MHLW, and FDA, it serves today as the gold standard for API manufacturing requirements. ICH Q10 Pharmaceutical Quality System (2008). Adopted by the EU, MHLW, and FDA, this harmonized guideline was the first to define the modern quality system and to discuss how it should be integrated into all aspects of the phar-maceutical business. The document recognized that Quality should not be a stagnant policing organization but a vibrant organization concerned with \"continual improvement of process per-formance and product quality through-out the product lifecycle.\" It openly dis-cussed management responsibility and challenged the industry to consider that management of outsourced activities was a crucial element of a quality system. The impact of this document on the indus-try is still being discussed at conferences, and companies are implementing many of its requirements. ICH Q11 Development and Manufacture of Drug Substances (2012). Released in May 2012, this guideline has only been adopted by the EU to date. Q11 describes approaches to developing and understanding the man-ufacturing process of the drug substance, and offers guidance on what related infor-mation should be included in the Com-mon Technical Document (CTD). The impact of Q11 is currently unknown but this author is sure it will follow the tradi-tion of the other ICH documents. As outlined herein, there have been rnage several changes in the pharmaceuti-cal industry during the 35 years that Phar- maceutical Technology magazine has been in existence. A broader industry timeline is contained within these anniversary pages as well. Let's hope the next 35 years are as exciting and successful as the past 35. PT 2010 IMS Health reports that the world pharmaceutical market is valued at $875 billion. The IPEC Federation is es-tablished, joining IPEC-Americas, IPEC-Europe, IPEC-Japan, and IPEC-China. President Obama signs the Affordable Care Act, which creates an abbreviated licensure pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be \"bi-osimilar\" to or \"interchangeable\" with an FDA-licensed bio-logical product. Various McNeil Consumer Healthcare/J&J OTC products are recalled due to odors, ultimately leading back to wooden pallets treated with TBA.

This same year, eight drug manufacturers agree to create a UN-administered pool of patented informa-tion and other data to spur new research into 21 tropi-cal diseases and ailments. FDA issues final guidance on OTC liquids and how they should be measured/dis-pensed. A proposed Generic Drug User Fee Act (GDUFA) is ratified by FDA; Congress is expected to pass the Act before September 2012. FDA Commissioner Hamburg restructures CDER, including a new Super Office of Compliance. Increased focus on drug importations and global compliance begin. 2009 FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg releases a new enforcement strategy to create \"a strong FDA.\" That same year, Pfizer acquires Wyeth, launching a series of Big Pharma-Biotech mergers and acquisitions and a new era of industry consolidation, including the merging of Merck & Co. and Schering-Plough Corp. and Roche and Genentech. Around the same time, Pfizer announces cost-cutting measures that include slashing more than 8000 jobs as it pre-pares for an expected revenue crash when blockbuster Lipitor loses patent protection. 2008 ICH publishes the globally harmonized Q10 Pharmaceutical Quality Sys-tem guideline. That same year, heparin contamination emerges from Chinese sup-plier Scientific Protein Labo-ratories. By June 2008, USP has issued the first stage of revision for its heparin monographs. FDA, EMA, and the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration enter into a joint pilot program for inspections. 50 Pharmaceutical Technology JULY 2012 PharmTech.com SPECIAL ANNIVERSARY SECTION: MANUFACTURING JEREN (FRANCE )/FUSION/ CASPAR BENSON/GETTY IMAGES Small-molecule APIs dominate phar- maceutical manufacturing, so where may future innovation reside? The scientific literature abounds with novelapproaches to a given synthesis or refine-ments to existing syntheses as a meansto improve product yield, process condi-tions, enantioselectivity, or production economics. These efforts are an integra l part of process development and commer-cial manufacturing and will continue to be so. But what may be the game-changer in small-molecule manufacturing? As weconsider the possibilities, continuous-flow technology through micreactors as an alternative to traditional batch manufac-turing may be one possibility. Continuous flow technology Continuous-flow technology involves the continuous introduction of a stream of chemical reactants into a flow or micro-reactor to yield a desired reaction product on a continuous basis (1). Continuous- flow technology may offer potential ad- vantages compared with traditional batch manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, suc h as greater optimization and control o f the process, an improved safety and en-vironmental profile for a given process, and a reduced manufacturing footprintcompared with batch-reactor systems (1). In general, microstructured devices with small internal volumes and hig h surface-to-volume ratios offer transport capabilities for rapid mixing, enhance d heat transfer for good temperature con - trol, and intensified mass transfer (2). Microstructured devices operate in a continuous-flow environment, which can provide controlled process condi-tions, high flow rates, and high mass throughput. Continuous operations also may allow for bulk-chemistry processes to have high production capacities. Fluid dynamics determine the characteristics of continuous-flow equipment, such aspressure loss, heat-transfer characteristics,residence time, and mixing time (2, 3). The factory of tomorrow Reflecting growing interest in micro-reactor technology for fine-chemica l manufacturing, Lonza reported earlier this year investment in what it terms the \"Factory of T omorrow,\" at its facil-ity in Visp, Switzerland. The facility will offer production of multitons o f intermediates and/or APIs based on continuous-flow processing. Lonza cur-rently operates assets that can produce several kilograms to several tons of small-molecule APIs using microreactors. The new facility will provide an integrated so-lution where all common unit operationsin flow can be streamlined in a flexible fashion using microreactors (FlowPlate, Lonza). The facility was slated to be op-erational in June 2012. The new unit will enable the integra - tion of complete flow processes in ad-dition to microreactors, according to company information. It will be able to integrate a range of flow reactors, such as continuous stirrer tank reactors or ul - trasounds and streamline flow processes, including work-up unit operations, suc h as liquid-liquid extraction, distillation(wiped-film, thin film). Higher pressure applications will be enabled as well by allowing gas-liquid reactions, such asozone and HCN chemistries. The tech-nology can be used for chemical reactions under severe and extreme conditions, such as very high temperatures or cryo-genic conditions.Marrying engineering and chemistry Effectively applying continuous-flow technology involves a multidisciplinary approach of chemistry and engineer-ing. As an example, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) reported on the development of a Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reac-tion in a continuous-flow microreactor system. Suzuki coupling is a palladium-catalyzed coupling between organoboron compounds and organohalides and is an important reaction in organic chemistry in general and for pharmaceutical com-pounds specifically. The researchers developed a continu - ous-flow Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction that started from phenols and pro- duced various biaryls in good yield usin g a microfluidic-extraction operation an d a packed-bed reactor. The project used amultidisciplinary approach with the re-search on microreactor technology devel-oped by a team led by Klaus F. Jensen, de - partment head, Warren K. Lewis professor of chemical engineering, and professor of materials science and engineering at MIT.The organic synthesis portion of the proj-ect was developed by a group led by Ste-phen Buchwald, Camille Dreyfus professorof chemistry at MIT (3-5).

Charles H. Squires, PhD, vice-president of dis-covery and external partnerships at Pfenex Inc., spoke with Pharmaceutica l Technology about advances in protei n y expression technology, and discussed the challenges yet to be overcome . PharmTech: Can you describe how the process of protein expression has im-proved or changed over the past 10 yearsor so? What are one or two key techno- logical advances that have made these changes possible? Squires: New methods to more rapidly and reliably express proteins have pro-liferated over the past decade and a half. Innovations in this area have included the improvement of expression hosts to introduce more phenotypic capability to produce active, undegraded protein. For instance, hosts have been modified to overexpress folding modulators or mu - tated to eliminate proteolytic activities. Also, there has been a large increase in the number of these tools available com-mercially, putting many effective ap-proaches within the reach of researchers with limited resources. The past several years have also seen the emergence of proprietary platform technologies, each of which offers some advantagesin expressing difficult proteins or which delivers an advantageous downstream process. Examples include platforms such as a strain of Escherishia coli that secretes product to the extracellular space (Wacker Chemie AG), a toolbox of regu-lated promoters in the yeast Pichia pasto - ris (VTU Tec hnologies), an d a comp letely s unique Pseudomonas fluorescen s-based expression platform (Pfenex). The Pfenex platform has proven highly effective in expressing a variety of types of proteins and employs a high-throughput paralle l processing technology in which a thou-sand or more unique expression strains are constructed and analyzed in about a month. Similar types of improvements have been made in the screening o f mammalian expression hosts for the extent of target protein expression, including fluorescence-activated cel l sorting for the selection of produc-tive clones. These technologies are particularly effective in the identifica-tion of cell lines expressing high levels of engineered monoclonal antibodies. In addition to these types of improve - ments to host and expression strategy,advances in gene design that go beyon d the traditional adherence to codon usage tables have been implemented,such as the technology developed b y DNA 2.0. Expression data-taught, host-specific algorithms that modulate DNA sequences while keeping protein amino acid sequence constant may add yet an-other dimension to the list of effective protein production tools. The commu-nity of researchers involved in all as-pects of protein production is certainly much better off than it was 20 years ago in its ability to provide solutions to protein expression, but it will take muc h more work understanding all aspects o f the nature of protein expression to ar-rive at universally applicable principles. Those solutions will necessarily involve an ever widening toolbox of approaches that will need to be accessed throug h more advanced parallel processin g tools. The principle difference now is that a multidimensional approach to gene and protein expression is avail-able to the great majority of researchers, whereas 20 years ago the process was one dimensional and digital, giving only a yes or no result. PharmTech : What parts of the protein- expression process are still rate-limiting, and how do you see these challenges being addressed? What improvements do you expect to see in the future ? Squires: We anticipate that given the continued need for protein supply across the spectrum of applications, many o f the existing weak links in protein ex-pression will be strengthened. One of the most pressing unmet needs is production of small amounts of protein for researc h purposes. Often, dozens of proteins ranging from antigens for preclinica l testing to related variants of a target pro-tein for some form of differential testing are required. While only a small amount of protein, a few mg, is generally require d for activity evaluation or crystallization for these types of studies, currently all o f the cloning steps needed to get even thatsmall amount of protein are identical to those required to assemble a strain or cell line for large-scale biopharmaceuti-cal production. This is highly inefficient and a consistent bottleneck in the pro-cess. Clearly, there is a need to develop off-the-shelf solutions to fill this gap. New, precise, and more adaptable toolsallowing more rapid cloning and char-acterization will need to be developed. These tools will necessarily include the development and adoption of more ef- fective high-throughput processing methods. Improvements in genetic, an - alytical, and processing methods prac-Improvements in expression platforms and enhanced tools for selecting clones are among the advances of the past few decades.A Q&A with Pfenex moderated by Amy RitterAdvances in Protein ExpressionPharmaceutical Technology JULY 2012 53 SPECIAL ANNIVERSARY SECTION: MANUFACTURING 650 w/1235 Illuminated Switch Tank ValveSteam Valve Unique Automation Concepts Solution Driven Innovative Product Development Customized Multiport Solutions Pro-active Project ManagementCompact Multiport T Bonnet with lockout device 3800 CAMP CREEK 678-553-3459 www.gemu.com Experience the Quality Touchticed in high throughput, parallel modes will enable the researcher to access more tools and reach a wider range of solutions more rapidly. Clearly, for these approaches to have an impact, methods to allow the re-searcher to identify productive clones at the earliest possible stage must be developed. Better reporter systems that may enable screening, even at the colony or single cell level, would be very valuable. Processing to obtain small amounts of protein would then benefit from the development of more efficient purification tags. These may also be envisioned to include reliable expres-sion reporter sequences, sequences that promote proper protein folding, and ideally be efficiently and univer-sally removable. Pfenex is exploring this segment, adapting its expression platform strategy specifically for cus-tom reagents. Development in this area would be of great benefit not only to the core of researchers producing proteins for research purposes but the benefits would be amply felt in the area of target protein expression as well. Another route to solve the problem of small-scale supply would be to adopt a cell-free approach such as that employed by Sutro Biopharma. Such an approach is enabled today by the relatively rapid, commercial availability of synthetic, gene-length DNA sequences. Devel-oping an off-the-shelf cell-free system would jump the cloning and cell growth steps in the current processes and po-tentially deliver advantages of protein quality as well. An in vitro system would also be able to take advantage of the re- porter and purification technologies mentioned above for in vivo systems. As more and more dimensions to protein production are added, the researchers' ability to deliver will continue to im-prove. The challenge will continue to evolve, however, as more and more types of hybrid or completely synthetic pro-teins are developed that may or may not have some evolutionarily defined path to proper folding and thus activity.

In 1990, several top players were not stand-alone drug companies but instead were the pharmaceutical units of mul-tinational chemical companies, reflect-ing the historical marriage between the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. As the strategic value of pharmaceuticals as a business grew, so did merger and acquisition (M&A) activity, and with it, divestments of chemical and agrochemi- cal concerns and M&A of pharmaceu-tical businesses that would eventually create the pharmaceutical powerhouses of today . T oday , the industry is again atanother crossroad as it contends with generic-drug incursion and reduced R&Dproductivity, thereby facing challenges by which the top companies have responded by increasing biologic-based drug devel-opment, targeting growth in emergin g markets, and beginning to apply diag- nostics in drug development. The 1990s and early 2000s More than two decades ago in 1990,Merck & Co. was ranked as the num- ber one company in prescription drug sales, followed by Bristol-Myers Squibb,which had moved into the number twospot with the 1989 merger of Bristol - Myers and Squibb (see Table I). Glaxo wasranked third and SmithKline Beecham fourth, following the merger in 1989 o f Philadelphia-based SmithKline Beck-man with the UK-based Beecham Group. In 1995, Glaxo and Burroughs Wellcome Tracking change from spinoffs of chemical companies to life-sciences powerhouses. Patricia Van ArnumDecades of Change for the Top Pharmaceutical Companies PharmTech : Looking ahead, how will the pharmaceutical company of 2020 be different from the pharmaceutical company of 2010? How would it be the same? Carolyn Gauntlett, consultant, IMS Health: 2012 could mark the year when the first company, Teva Pharmaceutical, which neither originated in Europe or the United States or that is primarily a R&D-led organization, becomes a top-10 global pharmaceutical company. The grouping of top-10 global pharmaceutical companies that Teva joins is, itself, changing rapidly as innovative launches become fewer and yield less and pharmaceutical companies are diversifying into other healthcare fields. Crucial questions are how companies are most likely to develop in the next 10 years and what the successful models to survive and thrive will be. To understand the drivers that will shape the top-10 companies of the future, IMS finds that the innovative R&D model is under increasing pressure, with R&D costs rising for at best, no more, but more likely, fewer, new molecules, which in turn do less well in terms of overall sales and market share in the cost-constrained Western markets, which constitute most of the sales opportunity. We believe this inexorable pressure will not only cause the top-10 companies to continue to diversify out of their core of innovative prescription medicines, but it could also mean that within a decade, fewer very large companies will depend on full-line discovery to commercialization as their primary business. The listing of top-10 companies will still have companies fitting this bill, but the top-10 companies also will include organizations focusing only on the commercialization of products developed elsewhere. In addition, the top-10 companies will contain some companies with a primary focus not on innovation, but on the payer, and therefore will be an international player capable of delivering low-cost, high-volume solutions to major institutional buyers across the globe and across the spectrum of pharmaceutical, and maybe, more generally healthcare provisions from specialty to primary care. Innovative players also will become more payer-focused and be intimately involved in the production and interpretation of real-world evidence to develop the use of their protected products. The innovative- and payer-focused company models already exist, but a third model also will develop, aided by the rise of patient power and new technology. A combination of consumer focus, direct communication with patients through social media, and the development of applications (i.e., apps) as genuinely useful, even vital, tools for patients and prescribers will allow companies to create a patient-led competitive space that has, to this point, not existed. Lastly, all companies that aspire to enter or remain in the top-10 will have to grow the value contribution that emerging markets make to their global revenues. This strategy will be both from business models adapted to pharmerging markets' voracious appetite for low-cost, high-volume generic products and by developing the market for high-value, patent-protected new agents. The BRICT countries (i.e, Brazil, Russia, India, China, and Turkey), which soon will drive more than 50% of the world's value growth, will become viable drivers of innovation and value.A look into the future: the pharmaceutical company of 2020Than ks for your industry leadership and for being a great partner.

Other leading pharmaceutical compa- nies in 1990 were not stand-alone enti-ties, but instead were the pharmaceutical businesses of multinational chemical companies: Ciba-Geigy (Swiss), Hoechst (German), Sandoz (German), and Rh\u00d4ne Poulenc (French). The spinoffs of the pharmaceutical units from these chemcal companies and subsequent M&A resulted in the creation of larger, pharmaceutical-based companies. In 1995, the German chemical con- glomerate Hoechst acquired Marion Merrell Dow of Kansas City, Missouri , a pharmaceutical concern created from the 1989 merger of Marion Laboratories and Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals. In 1989, Dow Chemical had acquired a controlling interest in Marion Laboratories, which was renamed Marion Merrell Dow. In 1999, the pharmaceutical unit of Hoechst, Hoechst Marion Roussel, merged with Rh\u00d4ne-Poulenc (which had spun off its chemicals division in 1997 into a sepa-rate company, Rhodia) to create a separate pharmaceutical company, Aventis, which was later acquired by Sanofi-Synth\u00e9labo in 2004 to create Sanofi-Aventis. Sanofi-Synth\u00e9labo had been formed in 1999 by the merger on Sanofi and Synth\u00e9labo. In 1996, Novartis was established from the merger of the pharmaceutical businesses of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz fol-lowing the respective spinoffs of the spe-cialty chemical businesses of Ciba-Geigy to form Ciba-Geigy Specialty Chemicals and of Sandoz to form Clariant, which later acquired the specialty chemical business of Hoechst in 1997. In 2000, Novartis divested its agrochemical busi-ness and combined it with the divested agrochemical business of AstraZeneca to form Syngenta, thereby focusing Novar-tis and AstraZeneca in pharmaceuticals. AstraZeneca was created from the 1999 merger of Astra AB of Sweden and the Zeneca Group of the UK. Zeneca was formed from the demerger of three busi-nesses (pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and specialty chemicals) of the UK chem-ical company ICI beginning in 1993. American Home Products, which in- cluded its pharmaceutical business, then called Wyeth-Ayerst, merged in 1994 with the conglomerate American Cyanamid, which was diversified in consumer and industrial products, pharmaceuticals, agro-chemicals, and industrial chemicals. Seek-ing to build its life-science activities, Amer-ican Home Products was subsequently Table I: Top global pharmaceutical companies, 1990 Rank CompanyGlobal sales ($ Billion)* 1 Merck & Co. 5.221 2B r i s t o l -Myers Squibb 4.721 3 Glaxo 4.5474S m i t h Kline Beecham 4.000 5C i b a -Geigey 3.828 6 American Home Products3.545 7 Hoechst 3.484 8 Johnson & Johnson 3.3489 Eli Lilly 3.03010 Bayer Roche -Plough 2.205 *Sales of human prescription drugs reported in constant US dollars.

For example, pro-totypes exist today for lines that can run vials, syringes, or cartridges, rather than having separate lines for each. Ten years from now we expect to be using this type of combination line. From a supply chain standpoint, 10 years from now, companies will be more focused on where they can add value. For example, fill-finish lines will use ready-to-use vials rather than having vial washing at the start of the line. This is already occurring, but it will be several years before it really takes hold. We also expect to see more innova-tion in components and delivery systems, such as retractable needles and the blurring of the line between syringes and cartridges. While the benefits of plastic components compared to glass are documented, we see their higher cost as a significant barrier. Stauss (Vetter): An important task over the coming years will be to work in close cooperation with packaging suppli-ers to further align quality parameters in order to achieve higher quality levels throughout the entire supply chain. For example, using a laser in a cut-to-length process for the manufacture of glass bar-rels can meet increasing glass-breakage requirements. Another example is in the manufacture of components (e.g., stop-pers), in which fully automated visual in-spection can be used to check for defects (e.g., particles, inclusions). PharmTech: What do you think the in- fluence of QbD will be in the upcoming years? Agalloco: The early adopters of QbD are well ahead of everyone else and mak-ing it evident there's much to be gained through it. Regulatory support, and cer-tainly some prodding as well, is pushing the rest of industry to introduce it as a matter of routine. The benefits of QbD are well known, but it requires almost a cultural shift within the industry be-fore it becomes standard practice. Once folks get comfortable with it, they won't want to develop any product or process without it. Hawkins (Cook): Regulatory authorities are clearly leading this effort, but like anything else, it takes time for everyone to understand how to implement it.

The polls directed in fivemain areas: manu- facturing, biologic-based API manufactur- ing, solid dosage/oral drug delivery, sterile manufacturing, and analytical methods development and instrumentation (see Figures 1-5). Although individual techno-logical advances were cited, an important theme throughout all the polls was the importance of quality by design (QbD). The importance of quality by design QbD came into prominence a decade ago when FDA announced a significant new initiative in August 2002, Pharmaceuti - cal Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs ) for the 21st Centur y (1). The ini - y tiative was intended to modernize FDA's regulation of pharmaceutical quality fordrugs and select human biological prod-ucts such as vaccines. The initiative evalu-ated the pharmaceutical as well as the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) regulatory programs with the fol - lowing specific goals: t\u0001 Encourage adoption of new techno- logical advances t\u0001 Facilitate application of modern qual -ity management techniques, including quality systems, to pharmaceuticalproduction and quality assurance tEncourage implementation of risk- based approaches tEnsure that regulatory review, compli- ance, and inspection policies are base d on modern pharmaceutical science tEnhance the consistency and coordi- nation of FDA's drug-quality regula-tory programs, in part, by further in enhanced quality-systems approaches (1).The science- and risk-based approac h to pharmaceutical manufacturing that underpins quality by design has been fur-thered by subsequent guidance from FDA, EMA, and the International Conference on Harmonization. It is not surprising, there- fore, that QbD was cited as a significant factor in reader polls. Drug-substance manufacturing When asked what was the most important change that has influenced chemical API development and manufacturing during the past 10 years, 61% of respondents cite d QbD (see Figure 1). The significance o f QbD far exceeded any single technologica l advancement in chemical API manufac-turing, including microreactors, chemoca-talysis, and biocatalysis. Readers point to quality by design as having a significant influence on manufacturingand drug development during the past decade.

Thirty percent cited QbD as the most significant change in biologic-based API manufac-turing. Advancement of single-use tech-nologies closely followed at 28%, and then improvements in upstream and down-stream processing, each cited by 21% of readers polled. Dosage form development, manufac- turing, and analytical technology We also asked readers to evaluate which technology has contributed the most to advancing oral product forms or oral drug delivery (see Figure 3). The two areas that received the highest responses were orally disintegrating tablet technol-ogy (24%) and nanotechnology-based applications (21%). Advances in isolator technology and systems was cited as the most significant gain in sterile manufacturing, being cited by 36% of respondents, making it the highest ranked change in this area (see Figure 4). QbD followed at 23%. Reflecting again the importance of QbD, 30% of respondents identified process analytical technology (PAT) as the most significant development in analytical methods development and in-strumentation (see Figure 5). PAT tied with greater throughout in chromato-graphic methods as the most impor-tance advance. Looking ahead We also asked readers to identify what they think will be the most signifi-cant change influencing the future of drug development and manufacturing (see Figure 6). More than one-third (36%) of respondents said the move to personalized medicine through the increased use of diagnostics with tra-ditional pharmaceuticals. More than one-quarter (29%) said the rise of biologic-based drugs in drug pipelines and commercial product portfolios fol-lowed by fuller adoption of QbD (22%). Reference 1.

In 2002, Ameri-can Home Products changed its name to Wyeth, after spinning off unrelated busi-nesses to focus on its pharmaceutical and consumer-healthcare businesses. Building critical mass in the 2000s Pfizer's ascent from the 14th ranked phar- maceutical company in 1990 to the num-ber one company in 2000 was achieved by acquisition, most notably the acquisition of Warner-Lambert in 2000, for which Pfizer had outbid American Home Products (see Tables I, II). In 1996, Pfizer had formed a comarketing agreement with Warner-Lambert on Lipitor and with its acquisi-tion of Warner-Lambert in 2000, Pfizer secured its top prize in Lipitor, which was to become the top-selling prescription drug for Pfizer and the industry dur-ing the 2000s. With the acquisition of Warner-Lambert, Lipitor became one of eight blockbuster drugs (defined as drugs with sales of $1 billion or more) for Pfizer in 2000. The others were: Norvasc, Zoloft, Neurontin, Celebrex, Zithromax, Viagra, Pfizer acquired Pharmacia. In 1995, Pharmacia & Upjohn was formed through the merger of Pharmacia AB and the Upjohn Company. In 2000, Pharmacia acquired Monsanto, which included G.D. Searle, the pharmaceuti-cal unit of Monsanto, and in 2002, Phar-macia spun off Monsanto as a separate agrochemical/agricultural company. In 2009, Pfizer acquired Wyeth for $68 billion, cementing its position as the number one global pharmaceutical com-pany (see Table III). The Pfizer-Wyeth merger was one of three megamergers in the late 2000s. In 2009, Merck & Co. acquired Schering-Plough for $41 billion, and Roche acquired the remaining shares that it did not already own of the biophar-maceutical company, Genentech, for $47 billion. In April 2011, Sanofi-Aventis completed its acquisition of the biophar-maceutical company Genzyme and sim-plified its name to Sanofi in May 2011. In 2011, Abbott Laboratories an- nounced plans to separate into two com-panies: one in medical products, which will keep the Abbott name, and a second company focused on research-based pharmaceuticals, which will be called AbbVie. The separation is expected to be completed later this year in 2012. The decade of the 2010s What will the next decade bring? In looking at the list of the top 15 global pharmaceutical companies in 2011, we see two key trends already represented: the rising role of generic drugs in the prescription drug market through the positioning of the generic-drug compay Teva Pharmaceutical among the top 10 global pharmaceutical companies and the growing importance of biologic-based drugs through the rise in the rankings of the biopharmaceutical com-pany Amgen as well Roche and Sanofi following their respective acquisitions of the biopharmaceutical companies Genentech and Genzyme (see Table III). What then will be the pharmaceuti- cal company of 2020 be (see sidebar, page 54)? Will the next decade bring more bolt-on acquisitions as pharmaceu-tical companies focus on specialty-based products as the blockbuster-drug model erodes? Will there be acquisitions in di-agnostics for building positions in per-sonalized therapeutics or other health-care-related businesses? What role will emerging markets play? Are there other megamergers in the offing? Although we don't know the answers to these questions yet, one thing is certain: as in previous de-cades, the decade of the 2010s portends to be another period of change for the global pharmaceutical industry. PT contin. from page 5662 Pharmaceutical Technology JULY 2012 PharmTech.com SPECIAL ANNIVERSARY SECTION: OUTSOURCING JEREN (FRANCE )/FUSION/ CASPAR BENSON/GETTY IMAGES As pharmaceutica l companies face AAgreater cost pressure, they must de-AA cide how to best allocate resou rces AA for development and manufacturing, which entails working with contract ser - vices providers. To examine these dynam-ics, Pharmaceutica l Technology conducte d y an industry roundtable to gain input on how the expectations between sponsor companies and contract service provid-ers have and will evolve. Participating in the roundtable are: Kuljit Bhatia, vice-president of R&D, DPT Laboratories; Ar - naud Hanquez, head of business develop-ment, EU Hospira Kosko, president of CentreSource; global di-rector of technical sales, SAFC; Derek Hen-necke, president and CEO of Xcelience; an d Michael Ruff, PharmD and vice-presidentof pharmaceutical development, and Jef- frey Basham, vice-president of business development, both at Metrics. A decade of change PharmTech : What have been the most significant changes in pharmaceutical out-sourcing during the past 10 years, Kosko (Pfizer CentreSource) : The most significant change over the past de-cade has been the ever-growing acceptance of outsourcing as a core supply-chain strat-egy within the pharmaceutical industry. In the past, most major pharma companies felt the need to control the vast majorit y of their supply chains internally. As thesecompanies have faced loss of exclusivity on patent-protected products, research productivity challenges, and capital con-straints, the contract manufacturing mar - ket segment has thrived. The emergence o f specialty, second tier, and virtual pharmacompanies has supported this developing trend. The type of outsourcing has shifte d as well-away from 'transaction activity' and toward 'strategic activity.' Key factorsinfluencing the relationship between con-tract service providers and their customersinclude supply assurance, regulatory com-pliance, product quality, customer service, and cost. A shortcoming in any of theseareas could result in a challenging situa-tion for the sourcing company. Bhatia (DPT): Internal cost pressures and a dearth of blockbuster approvals have driven Big Pharma and emerging bio/pharma companies to look outside their organizations to contract pharma, but life-sciences companies have become more selective in choosing a contract provider. They are increasingly moving toward a strategic partner relationship model rather than a tactical one. In the past, Big Pharma would only outsource specific tasks of the development program to a CRO or CDMO. This resulted in in-creased overall cost (translational and pro- fessional), increased cycle time, and signifi- cant oversight. A strategic partnership with a 'one-stop-shop' CRO that specializes in the sponsor company's specific therapeu-tic area eliminated these drawbacks. This is the most significant change that has oc-curred in past 10 years . Hanquez (Hospira) : The change is the organic maturation of the industry for both categories of players. On one side, custom-ers grew internal outsourcing/purchasing groups and developed skills in CMO selec-tion. They have accumulated experience, started to use sophisticated evaluationtools, thereby making the whole CMO- selection process structured and more predictable. This level of sophistication decreases randomness of the outsourc-ing relationships and is a major driver o f growth for top-CMOs Providers, on the other side, started fall- ing into two distinctive categories: CMO powerhouses, rich in experience and tech-nical capabilities, and those who purchased one to two facilities from larger biopharma companies hoping to build a healthy CMO business while harvesting the inherited contracts. Now, many of them struggle to fill capacity and keep up with investments required to stay on the top of growing quality and compliance requirements. So, we have a duality in the market: relation-ships are becoming more strategic between visionary biopharma companies and pre- ferred CMOs, but relationships with sec- ond-tier CMOs are becoming even more transactional based on the short-term cus-tomer benefit of a lower price. Hennecke (Xcelience): Ten years ago, p harmaceutical outsourcing was stil l viewed with a touch of suspicion, and when it was embraced, it was for two fundamen-tal reasons: reducing costs and increasin g turnaround times. Those two reasons are still front and center, but now they're so basic, customers take them for granted. Of course, outsourcing will cut costs an d increase turnaround time. But what else? The field has grown increasingly more competitive and today's client expects an innovative, high-performance provider that will open doors to specialized exper-tise or proprietary technology, help them with solubilization challenges and otherproblem-solving, reduce business ris k, and tighten the supply chain. Really whatwe're talking about is a change of mindset among outsourcing providers from reac-tive service delivery to proactive solutions. Many firms still haven't adapted. Those who have are not only increasing marketshare, they're embedding themselves in the Sponsor companies' increasing focus on strategic outsourcing has changed the rules of the game.

Basham (Metrics): A key change is the transition from the technical lead independently deciding where, when, and how to outsource to an outsourc-ing manager leading the decision on a team. Out-sourcing management by teams allows for preferred-provider operations and cost controls. Additionally, the cycle of spend on outsourcing ranged from a fre-netic pace during the first five years of the last 10 years to the drying up of venture money supporting the outsourcing of the virtual bio/pharma business model. Dur-ing the first half of the past 10 years, there has been a switch at the top 25 to 30 large pharma companies, both in mergers and in consolidation of their facilities, which has both provided opportunity to the out-sourcing company as well as challenges. In addition, large pharma companies have begun to compete in the CMO area by offering contract manufacturing to keep their facilities operating. At the same time, outsourcing competition has expanded ex-ponentially due to large layoffs in the large pharma/biotech companies. Many very good scientists in R&D and manufacturing have gone out on their own to build new competitive businesses. Weiler (SAFC): During the past 10 years, we have seen significant change. In 2010, only 20% of all launched drugs were originated by the top 25 Big Pharma companies. This paradigm shift and the increase in more specialist-care drugs coming to market have made it a require-ment for drug manufacturers to have faster and more flexible processes to get drugs to market. Smaller pharma or virtual biotech companies are looking for a different type of partnership with their CMO. These companies need speed, regulatory expe- rience, technical knowledge, and best-in-class project management, which creates opportunities for CMOs in the Western world, including for emerging technolo-gies, such as high-potency APIs, gene therapies, and microbial fermentation. The preferred-provider model PharmTech: In certain areas (i.e., clinical research), we see the preferred-provider model. Will the preferred-provider model evolve for other segments? Kosko (Pfizer CentreSource): A defi- nite trend toward the preferred-provider model is gaining marketplace momentum. A number of current examples show major pharma companies establishing partner-ships with CROs as they focus on manag-ing fixed costs and increasing productiv-ity. As more and more technical platforms become universally available, I can see this trend expanding into formulation develop-ment and process development. Manufac-turing may be a larger challenge, in that the best solid dose preferred-provider may not be the best sterile partner, which increases the likelihood that preferred providers may segment along technology lines rather than on inclusive one-on-one relationships. By using a preferred-provider model and con-solidating to fewer providers, outsourcing firms can exercise greater influence and control over the operation of the CMO. The industry preference for secondary sourcing, which may or may not be avail-able from a preferred CMO's network, will be another challenge. Bhatia (DPT): The preferred provider model will surely evolve into other CMC segments, including formulation develop-ment, process development, and manu-facturing. As drug products become more complex, sponsor companies are looking for an outsource provider to draw a road-map to the target goal. They are primar-ily looking for reduced cycle times (both in contract negotiation and development times due to preferential treatment) and limited oversight, resulting in cost savings and more importantly, quick approval and launch. The reasons to deviate from the preferred provider model may be because of a specific task or technology that only a non-preferred provider can deliver. Hennecke (Xcelience): I don't think you can take for granted at this point that the preferred-provider model is strongly rooted and gaining ground in other seg-ments. It's certainly an arrangement that is being experimented with by companies. A preferred provider is a marriage of sorts\u2014one with a pretty serious pre-nup. Should you marry one key outsourced provider in your pipeline? Maybe. Should you look for long-term happiness with every outsourcer in your pipeline? Probably not. The whole concept of preferred provid-Industry roundtable participants, from left to right: Kuljit Bhatia, vice-president of R&D, DPT Laboratories; Arnaud Hanquez, head of business development, EU Pharmaceut 2 One; Michael Kosko, president, Pfizer CentreSource; Andreas Weiler, global director of technical sales, SAFC; Derek Hennecke, president and CEO, Xcelience; and Michael Ruff (not pictured), PharmD, vice -president of pharmaceutical development, and Jeffrey Basham (not pictured), vice-president of business development, Metrics.

Some global CROs have established these partnerships and have delivered real client value while oth-ers have failed to lead to the returns ex-pected by either side. Ultimately, this sort of business-relationship decision is, like marriage, personal. There's no one-size fits all. Each company must look for the arrangement that best de-risks its overall drug-development program. Most will probably continue to choose best-in-class providers that can provide services, such as formulation development, which require a level of complexity or attention than a one-stop shop cannot provide. The key to a successful portfolio strategy is to have ser-vice providers that are willing to coordinate with upstream/downstream providers to smooth transitions, accelerate timelines, and ensure quality of supply. Basham (Metrics): We have seen this al- ready taking place. While specialty needs will still be needed, the outsourcing man-agement model will continue to downsize the number of contractors with which a company will work. This is particularly true for large pharma/biotech and the larger mid-sized pharma/biotech compa-nies. This allows for streamlined manage-ment of the vendor, common rules, and less overall personnel needed to manage the outsourcing model. Influence of quality by design PharmTech: Has quality by design (QbD) influenced the outsourcing relationship? (See also page 59 in this issue for readers' views on quality by design). Kosko (Pfizer CentreSource) : I fully expect that the benefits and advantages bestowed by a QbD approach will be an increasing topic of discussion, especially for new high-value projects proceeding through the development cycle. Selecting a service provider with expertise, capabil-ity, and experience can lead to a valuable dialogue on the range of potential benefits. A robust QbD approach also can lead to a greater understanding of the manufactur- What will the CRO/CMO of tomorrow be like? Jim Miller, president of PharmSource, shared his views in a podcast with Pharmaceutical Technology , which can be found at PharmTech.com/Podcast. A portion of that interview is below. PharmTech: Looking ahead 10 years from now, how will the contract service provider of tomorrow differ from the provider of today and what factors will influence the outsourced relationship? Miller: The big changes that are impacting the pharma industry generally will really be the big drivers of what happens to the CRO and CMO industry. If you think about the big changes that are occurring in pharma today, I think the ones that are most critical from a CRO/CMO perspective are first, a movement toward a world of smaller, niche products, often linked to diagnostic tests, rather than the blockbuster or even mid-sized products that had characterized the industry for much of the past 10 to 15 years. Secondly, as the industry has become more global, its markets are more dispersed, and now you are not just dealing with the regulatory requirements of a handful of very large countries, but increasingly, the regulatory requirements and issues in places like China, India, Brazil, and South Africa, which have to be factored into your manufacturing and regulat ory strategy planning. Thirdly, the technologies and practices that companies are deve loping, particularly in the very earliest stages of the development process, will result in fewer candidates being progressed through the pipeline, but those candidates will have a greater probability of success. As that happens, you are going to see fewer opportunities for CROs and CMOs, but those opportunities will become all the more critical to the clients-the pharma companies-because they [the drug candidates] will be vetted and companies will have a lot more riding on them. And finally, there is much uncertainty as to who is going to pay for new drugs and that's going to affect what new drugs move forward and how much revenue companies can get from new drugs, and perhaps more importantly, how companies demonstrate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of these drugs as they move through the pipelines. So all these developme nts will create new demands on CMOs and CR Os, and they are going to have to adapt their business models and capabilities. First among th ose, they are going to have be more results- and value-oriented, so they are going to have to de monstrate that they can do things faster and more cost-effectively and that they are bringing services and insight to the table that address those broader issues that their clients are facing. Also, I think technology is going to be key. I think that information technology, both from the data management and analysis on the clinical side and from supply-chain and logistics management on the CMC side, is extremely critical, and you are starting to see the largest CROs and CMOs make significant investments in those information-based technologies. Also because the markets and supply chains are going to be so disper sed, you are going to see companies move to a broader network of smaller facilities with equipment that is designed for smaller, more frequent batches of products rather than having one big manufactur ing site that exports throughout the world. You may see smaller facilities in many different coun tries, each making smaller batches of products appropriate for local markets and able to handle multiple products in one facility. And you are going to increa singly see the equipment manufacturers develop manufacturing technologies that are much smaller scale, for instance, microreactors for the small-molecule API world or 'bioreactors in a bag' using disposable contact parts for large-molecule development. What that means is that you are going to see CROs and CMOs that are very global, but that are very savvy with technology and that have deep pockets, so that they will be able to make the necessary investments in these technologies and operate on a global scale.

A look into the future of pharmaceutical outsourcing: perspectives from Jim Miller, president of PharmSource Jim Miller , president of PharmSource Pharmaceutical Technology JULY 2012 67 SPECIAL ANNIVERSARY SECTION: OUTSOURCING ing process for both partners, which ulti- mately results in a better management of quality, change control, and supply. Bhatia (DPT): Increased FDA oversight has resulted in a strong emphasis on quality management systems. Failure to adopt new initiatives that drive quality has recently re-sulted in warning letters, consent degrees, and even closure of plants for pharma, biotech, and contract providers. QbD is a similar initiative that will ultimately drive quality. It is expensive and requires change in processes and systems. But that is what is needed to deliver the quality that the agency is targeting for the future. The sur-vival and success of the CRO that supports CMC could depend on the decision to ei-ther sit on the sidelines or make the tough decision to support this initiative. Weiler (SAFC): With more than 80% of all new chemical entities originated by small virtual pharma or biotech compa-nies, QbD plays an important role. CMOs have to use all their experience to advise their sponsors on the fastest and most effi-cient way to move forward. An experienced CMO will have worked with many differ-ent sponsor companies, so the concept of continuous improvement is built into daily operations. As a CMO, we are always looking at ways to build out each process by adopting and implementing best-practice procedures. This experience, coupled with the speed and flexibility of virtual pharma companies can be one of the key success factors when using the QbD approach in an outsourcing relationship. Hennecke (Xcelience) : The pharma- ceutical industry has learned the collective lesson that a lack of process control can lead to significant downstream costs in terms of time and money. The industry's response has been to bring QbD into the earlier stages of development. The ques-tion is not really whether or not to imple-ment QbD, but how and when. Because of their breadth in customer bases and scientific understanding, service provid-ers are increasingly in a strong position to offer solutions to complex formulation and process-development needs using QbD. Many sponsors are looking for advice from consultants and outsourcing part-ners on the role of QbD in their drug-development strategy. More and more, I see contract service providers actively engag-ing in discussions with sponsor companies early in the development process, recog-nizing the significant value in the CMC data package as sponsor companies con- contin. on page 7368 Pharmaceutical Technology JULY 2012 PharmTech.com SPECIAL ANNIVERSARY SECTION: FORMULATION JEREN (FRANCE )/FUSION/ CASPAR BENSON/GETTY IMAGES Nanotechnology has been used to develop innovative formulations to improve bioavailability of drugs, and have found utility as carriers for either highly toxic payloads, such as chemotherapeutics, or very fragile payloads, such as proteins or nucleic acids. Panayiotis P. Constantinides, PhD, founder and principal of Biopharmaceuti-cal and Drug Delivery Consulting, spoketo Pharmaceutica l Technology about th e y utility of nanotechnology in formulation strategies, both past and future . Advances in nanoparticles PharmTech: Can you identify one or two key technical advances that haveenabled the successful development o f nanoparticles as drug delivery vehicles? Constantinides: Within the scope o f this discussion, both 1-100 nm and sub-micron particles (100-1000 nm) are con-sidered as nanoparticles for both oral and non-oral drug delivery applications. The successful development of drug deliver y vehicles through advances in pharma-ceutical nanotechnology is certainly re- flected in the marketed nanoparticulate drug products which are in the submicron range Key technical advances which have enabled the successful development and commercialization of the afore- mentioned nanoparticulate drug products include advances in biology, materials science and particle engi-neering, processing, and manufactur - ing. Top-down and bottom-up manu-facturing methods at small and large scale have been applied and tailored to the specific compound and its appli-cation. During the top-down process, high shearing homogenization or me - dia-milling is used to reduce particle size in the presence of polymeric an d surfactant stabilizers to prevent crys- tallization and particle growth. In the bottom-up process of manufacturing nanoparticles, the nanoparticle is cre-ated from its individual components, using precipitation, coacervation,polymerization, and hydrophobic ag-gregation in an effort to achieve smal l size by controlling the thermodynam-ics and kinetics of nucleation, growth, and chemical reactivity. Layer-by-layerself-assemblies using biopolymers and synthetic polymers create versatilenanostructures for drug and gene de - livery. Nanoformulation is becoming an integral part of life-cycle manage - ment strategies for product line exten -sions and as enabling drug discovery technology for new molecular entities. Top-down and bottom-up meth - ods to manufacture nanoparticles have been applied to commercial products, the former for the marketed parentera l liposomal Doxil and the NanoCrys-tal drug products, and the latter for the albumin-bound nanoparticle Abraxane. For these drug products, advances in thecharacterization of nanoparticles an d better understanding of how the ADME properties of compounds administeredas nanoparticles are linked to particle size and surface chemistry have also contributed to their successful develop-ment and commercialization. In the case of the parenteral cancer chemotherapeu-tic drug products Doxil and Abraxane, key factors that have also contributed to their successful design and development were advances in nanoparticle targeting strategies based on the fundamental un-derstanding of tumor biology principles, such as tumor vasculature and perme - ability, pH, and surface antigens. Gains in selectivity and efficacy PharmTech: What advances to you expect to see in the future that will improve selectivity or efficacy? Constantinides : Nanoparticle selec- tivity and efficacy is particularly im-portant in parenteral drug delivery and targeting for cancer and other diseases. A look back at key nanoformulation advances and what lies ahead for nanoparticle-based drug-delivery systems.A Q&A with Biopharmaceutical and Drug Delivery Consulting, moderated by Amy RitterNanoformulations Nanoformulation is becoming an integral part of life-cycle management strategies for product line extensions and is enabling drug-discovery technology for new molecular entities.Pharmaceutical Technology JULY 2012 69 SPECIAL ANNIVERSARY SECTION: FORMULATION Linked to nanoparticle selectivity and efficacy is their potential toxicity. Fur-ther advances in cell and tissue imaging techniques and other in vitro and in vivo characterization methods of nanomate-rials and nanoparticles are necessary to better understand and predict toxicity. To this end, further development and clinical application of multifunctional nanoparticles which combine disease di-agnosis with therapy (nanotheranostics) could prove to be very useful. These sys-tems consist of a core which can be mag-netic for MRI or quantum dot for optical imaging, a lipidic and/or polymeric shell for intracellular targeting and an outer layer incorporating a surfactant or poly-meric stabilizer and a targeting moiety (e.g., antibody, aptamer, or ligand). The drug, small molecule or biologic, can be encapsulated in the core and/or the shell of the particle.Advances in image-guided drug de- livery will offer several advantageous fea-tures and enable scientists and clinicians to monitor and quantify drug release, non-invasively assess drug site accumulation, visualize biodistribution in real time, analyze drug distribution at the target site, predict drug response and evaluate drug efficacy and toxicity. Ultimately and perhaps not in the distant future, these features could be incorporated into microchips and personalized medicines. Most nanoparticles accumulate in the liver but depending on their size and charge can also accumulate in the kidney and other tissues. All classes of nanomaterials have extensive tissue re-tention, particularly carbon nanotubes and quantum dots, and this has toxico-logical implications. The state of nano-materials once deposited in the tissue is largely unknown. Furthermore, com-parison between and across complex nanoparticles is difficult. In reference to nanoparticle toxicity, limited number of nanomaterials have been evaluated to date, and mechanisms for nanomaterial toxicity are actively being pursued. Specific properties of nanometerials, particularly their sur-face characteristics, contribute to their toxicity. There is a need for nanotoxicity guidelines, and no specific regulations are available at the present time. However, assessing nanomaterial risks should be proactively pursued to identify and ana-lyze potential hazards, assess potential exposure scenarios and evaluate toxicity and analyze and communicate potential risks and uncertainties. From a formulation and process devel- opment perspective, we need to critically assess which lessons learned from the marketed nanoparticulate drug products can be applied to 1-100 nm particles and what is truly new science and knowledge. For example, new processing and char-acterization methods are needed along with the establishment of meaningful controls, specifications, and standards for 1-100 nm particles. Further advances in manufacturing methods are required in order to scale up and reproducibly produce complex multifunctional nanoparticles with an acceptable shelf-life. Drivers for future growth and commercialization of drug delivery nanoparticles include availability of funding, patent landscape, increased understanding of the pathophysiology of disease, and the need for novel drugs and safe therapies.

The future of drug delivery The future of process analytical technology70 Pharmaceutical Technology JULY 2012 PharmTech.com Pharma Ingredients: APIs & Excipients High-potency manufacturing contin- ues to be an area of investment for pharmaceutical companies and con- tract service providers. Many companies have recently invested or are planning expansions in API manufacturing and finished product manufacturing. Examining the market The impetus behind this investment has been the growth in the oncology drug market. In 2010, the global market for oncology drugs was $57.1 billion, ac-cording to the IMS Institute for Health-care Informatics. Market growth was strong; the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for oncology drugs was 13.2% between 2006-2010. Although growth is expected to slow, due in part to generic-drug incursion, the global oncology drug market is still expected to increase at a CAGR of 5-8% through 2015, and reach between $75 billion and $80 billion, making it the largest single largest therapeutic drug class by value, according to IMS estimates. API high-potency manufacturing To keep pace with market potential, several CMOs recently expanded capabilities for high-potency API manufacturing. In Oc-tober 2011, SAFC was granted SafeBridge certification for its commercial-scale high-potency facility in Verona, Wisconsin. The SafeBridge program assessment focuses on four primary areas: management, hazard identification and evaluation, hazard con-trols and communication, and education and training. The $30-million facility in Verona opened in 2010 to support Phase III and commercial-scale high-potency API manufacturing. The SafeBridge assessment also included a successful recertification of SAFC's nearby Madison, Wisconsin, high-potency manufacturing facility. In March 2012, the CMO Aesica opened a new $4.6-million high-potency manufac-turing facility for formulated products and confirmed plans to upgrade its API man-ufacturing facilities to manufacture high-potency APIs at commercial scale. The upgrade will enable Aesica to manufacture SafeBridge Category III API and formu-lated products from pilot to commercial scale from two of its sites in Europe. The new facilities will produce high-potency APIs in quantities of 1- 200 kg. Further investment in 2013 will equip Aesica to produce batch sizes up to 600 kg.

The expansion, announced in May 2011, was scheduled to be com-pleted in the second quarter of 2012. The expansion complements the company's high-potency GMP laboratory suites that operate on a gram scale. In its first-quarter earnings release, the company noted ap-proval for a 250-L high-potency API ex-pansion in Visp. Helsinn Advanced Synthesis recently reported on its cytotoxic and high-potency manufacturing facilities in Biasca, Switzerland and multiyear expansions. Its capabilities include pilot-scale, small-scale, and commercial-scale capabilities for man-ufacturing highly potent APIs. It cytotoxic capabilities include isolated and dedicated cytotoxic quality-control and R&D labo-ratories, raw-materials and finished-goods warehousing, and finishing and sampling areas. A new laboratory was constructed exclusively for small-scale cytotoxic pro-duction, design of experiment, and initial process development. The company also has pilot-scale, small-scale, and commer-cial-scale capabilities for manufacturing cytotoxic small molecules. Last October, the CMO Saltigo reported it was adding new production capacities for potent APIs at its facility in Redmond, Washington. The expansion, scheduled for completion in early 2012, allows for production and handling of Category III substances up to the kilogram range. Almac is expanding its manufacturing capacity to more than 30 m 3 at its Euro- pean headquarters in Craigavon, United Kingdom to include reactor vessels with product isolation and drying equipment to allow highly potent API manufacture up to the 600-kg batch size. Almac reported the expansion last October and said the facility will be built, commissioned, and validated in the next two years. Carbogen Amcis reported earlier this year that its facility in Bubendorf, Switzer-land, which includes the manufacture of high-potency APIs, successfully completed a FDA GMP audit for several commercial products and a pre-approval inspection for another program. The audit involved an analysis of all systems, procedures, and processes related to the development, validation, and manufacture of APIs and highly-potent APIs at the Bubendorf site.

In January 2012, Carbogen Amcis acquired Creapharm dosage forms. The acquisition gives Carbogen formulation, lyophilization and sterile GMP capabilities for drug products, including highly potent products, for pre-clinical and clinical-trial materials. In 2011, the biopharmaceutical com- pany OPKO Health acquired Fine T ech Pharmaceutical, an Israeli company fo-cused on manufacturing high-potency APIs. The acquisition included a facility in Nesher, Israel, for pilot- and commercial-scale production of high-potency APIs. Finished product manufacturing Companies also are investing in finished product manufacturing In September 2011, Roche opened a new 17,000-ft 2 clinical- supply manufacturing facility at its cam-pus in Nutley, New Jersey, for producing dosage forms of highly potent compounds for preclinical safety studies and Phase I and II clinical studies. The clinical dosage forms produced at the facility include tab-lets, capsules, powders, suspensions, and solutions. The facility has warehouses for components, excipients, APIs, mechanical rooms, and multipurpose isolation suites for manufacturing. In November 2011, Metrics began of- fering neat API capsule-filling at its po-tent and cytotoxic facility in Greenville, North Carolina. The company secured a Capsugel Xcelodose system, a powder microdoser and automated encapsula-tor that places API directly into capsules with a high level of accuracy. Metrics also installed a custom-built isolation system for the equipment. The company offers dedicated and segregated potent and cytotoxic cGMP manufacturing for Phase I-III projects. It opened a new potent and cytotoxic drug-development facility in 2009 as part of an expansion of the company's Greenville facility. Earlier this year, Baxter reported that its high-potency manufacturing facilities in Halle and Bielefeld, Germany, received SafeBridge certification. The facilities in Halle and Bielefeld support Baxter's Bio-Pharma Solutions business, a CMO pro- viding contract sterile manufacturing. In November 2011, Baxter's BioPharma Solu-tions business completed a capacity expan-sion at the company's cytotoxic contract manufacturing facility in Halle/Westfalen, Germany. The primary component of the expansion was the modular installation of an additional large-scale, commercial lyophilization unit for increasing freeze-drying capacity to support commercial cytotoxic manufacturing capacity. The ex-pansion followed expansions for cytotoxic manufacturing capacity in 2010 and 2006. The CDMO Pharmaceutics Interna- tional Inc. began cGMP aseptic fill-finish manu- facturing facility earlier this year. Targeted for completion in the fourth quarter 2012, the new facility will more than double the company's current sterile GMP manufac-ture capacity. Fill-finish suites will include automated vial and syringe filling, inspec-tion and labeling equipment capable of pro-ducing batch sizes of 100,000-plus units. The additional facilities will enable the company to provide preclinical through commercial-scale production and meet the growing demand for fill-finish services for potent compounds and oncology drugs. The CDMO Penn Pharma is invest- ing \u00a314 million ($22 million) to expand high-potency manufacturing at its facili-ties in South Wales, United Kingdom by adding a new 15,000-ft 2 development and commercial manufacturing unit for tablets and capsules. The new production facility is expected to be validated and running by the end of the first quarter 2013. Pfizer CentreSource has various technologies and capabilities for high- containment oral solid manufacturing, which includes its production facility in Freiburg, Germany.

A provider that can provide QbD services re-ally sets itself apart from the pack and takes solutions selling to a new level. Ruff (Metrics): QbD has definitely raised client expectations. They have read the ICH guidances and listened to FDA, which has signaled that failure to follow QbD is to invite delays in drug approvals. Sponsors now expect their providers to fully understand and apply QbD principles in their development projects. Clearly, this is already happening and will become in-creasingly important. Contract service pro-viders who follow the QbD pathway will have a significant competitive advantage. Looking ahead PharmTech: How will the contract service provider of 10 years from now differ from today's provider? Are there models from other industries that might be adapted? Michael Kosko (Pfizer CentreSource): I see a number of areas where contract pro-viders might modify their existing business model to be successful in the future: t\u0001Reach : Moving forward, contract service providers will have to expand their global footprints to fully sup-port their customers across major and emerging markets. t\u0001Partnership arrangements : I anticipate the development of new partnership arrangements that are designed to meet the needs of both customers and suppliers on a longer-term basis. t\u0001Cost-effectiveness : Managing cost will continue to be a focal point for the pharma industry. As specialized medicines becomes more important, the ability to handle small volumes in a cost-effective manner will be critical. t\u0001Services : Suppliers will likely expand their service offerings to encompass responsibilities that are currently han-dled by the customers, in areas such as global regulatory file management. t\u0001Technology: The industry will look to- ward incorporating new and emerg-ing technology to enable more highly consistent quality product while managing cost; broader adoption of continuous processing is one example. Bhatia (DPT): The future contract ser- vice provider will be an extension of the pharma or biotech industry in the true sense, with a focus on approvals rather than task completion. Decision-making, regulatory strategy, and a global presence will be key prerequisites in selecting a contractor. The relationship will be more strategic rather than tactical with a signifi-cant monetary milestone focus on final ap-proval from the agency (i.e., risk sharing). Hanquez (Hospira): The biggest driver of the future change in outsourc-ing relationships is the ever-increasing regulatory scrutiny, and it will reshape the outsourcing competitive landscape. Certain providers will weather the storm by keeping one step ahead of changing regulatory expectations and by investing in equipment and facilities to meet what will become the 'new norm' with regard to pharma manufacturing. Many others will not. Those providers that come out on the winning side will find themselves much more aligned with the pharmaceutical in-dustry, paving the way for the creation of stronger and broader relationships. Weiler (SAFC): The expectation is that our industry can move into the type of re-lationships that one sees in other industries. An example could come from the auto in-dustry, where you see that the key suppli-ers of automobiles are truly an extension of the branded automaker, and the question is whether this can be applied, through QbD and other methods, to a highly regulated pharma marketplace. I have confidence that we will continue to move in this di-rection, but it will not be easy as regulatory guidance, innovation and clinical attrition will be key differences to other industries. Hennecke (Xcelience): The next big change in our industry may come from within, but it will more likely be adapted from a peek over the fence into another industry. There is a small chance that our own industry's Steve Jobs is out there now envisioning what none of us have yet imag-ined, but that will soon become obvious . What do I see happening in our indus- try right now? There are so many changes afoot, but one I find particularly interesting is the increasing separation of new product development from existing operations- something our industry is gleaning from the high-tech industry. This separation lets each functional group focus on what it does best. Operational plants can apply lean Six Sigma concepts to streamline process flow and re-engineer facility design in a way that maximizes quality, productivity, and safety while new product-development sec-tors can harness their market knowledge and development strengths. The contract service provider of tomorrow will almost certainly be one best able to incorporate the voice of their customers into their service offering, but more than that, tomorrow's provider will challenge its customers to think about why they buy the way they do and to help them adjust their business models to better achieve their goals. Basham (Metrics) : We view the changes over the next 10 years will direct most CDMOs to become more global; that is multisite facility operations. However, dif-ferent than today, we think that these sites will need to have offerings that encompass the whole of the development process. This does not include discovery and research, but a focus on delivering the development process, including analytical support. We think that the pharma industry has some differences in modeling that make it more difficult to use models from other indus-tries. The key item from other industries will be oriented to in process quality and the extension of this into our industry. PTQbD has definitely raised client expectations.contin. from page 6774 Pharmaceutical Technology JULY 2012 PharmTech.com GLOWIMAGES/GETTY IMAGES PharmTech.com/TroubleshootingTROUBLESHOOTING Equipment and Processing Lyophilization presents challenges i n defining and accurately measurin g critical process and product param - eters (CPPs) in laboratory and commercia l scales .

ANALYSI S PharmTech: What analytical tools an d techniques are essential for a quality b y design (QbD) approach to a lyophilize d product? Are there any gaps in curren t technology in this area ? Gieseler (University of Erlangen-Nurem - berg) : An innovative, process analytica l technology (PAT) approach to freeze - drying requires a PAT tool that allow s for the determination of CPPs, such a s product interface temperature and prod - uct resistance, for the batch as a whol e (i.e., batch method). Ideally, the technol - ogy should be applicable in all scales o f equipment. As a compromise, two differ - ent technologies (i.e., one applied in th e laboratory and one in production) can b e used, but they must provide reliable an d comparable measures of the same pa -rameter without an inherent scale factor . In addition to the batch method, i t is also necessary to have a noninvasiv e measurement (i.e., no contact with th e product) of a CPP in a single vial. Th e reason for such a combination is simple . A batch method gives a global, averag e picture of product-drying performance , while the single-vial method determine s specific product-drying performance at a given spot in the freeze dryer. This woul d help to delineate drying heterogeneit y between vials (e.g., edge effects or ho t or cold spots on the freeze dryer shelf) , which is always present in a freeze drye r in whatever scale and which might eve n change over time in a given unit . Mayeresse (GSK Biologicals) : One of th e current weak points of freeze dryin g is the absence of direct measuremen t during the process. In the past, produc t probes were used to monitor the freeze - drying cycle, but they were not really reli - able. There are many reasons for this, bu t mainly they are invasive. As you modif y the freezing of a vial with a metallic wir e probe, it creates void around the wir e that allows vapor to escape more quickly . Today, automatic loading systems mea n that these probes cannot be used any - more. However, new PAT tools are ap - pearing on the market . Nail (Baxter Pharmaceutical Solutions ): We use tuneable diode laser absorptio n spectroscopy (TDLAS) as the main PA T for design-space development. It isn't es - sential, but it greatly decreases the tim e and effort required to construct a desig n space. We have found TDLAS to giv e accurate mass flow rates on laboratory - scale equipment, usually within about 6 % as compared with gravimetric determi - nation. We do this by weighing the fille d vials and stoppers before and after freez e drying. However, TDLAS on production - scale equipment is considerably less ac - curate because of complexities in th e dynamics of water-vapor flow from th e chamber to the condenser in large-scale , freeze-drying equipment . Page/Steiner (GEA Pharma Systems) :The most important aspects of understand - ing the lyophilization process are thos e that provide insight into the individua l vial rather than simply measuring th e integrated effect on the headspace . Simple aggregated measurements, suc h as chamber pressure, or more compl ex measurements, like the application o f mass spectrometers to the chamber gas , all have value for overall process control . To understand the range of proces s conditions caused by both forced an d natural variation within the overall sys - tem (i.e., equipment, vials, and product) , it is important to be able to characteriz e the range of experiences of individua l vials. However, the problem is that tech - niques examining the individual vial tha t can be used during development and val - idation are frequently difficult to deplo y in a large-production dryer . Pikal (University of Connecticut): The key properties to measure are produc t temperature and primary drying time . Unfortunately, product temperature i n given vials cannot be measured in a rep - resentative way. Inserting temperatur e probes reduces the degree of super-cool - ing, making the measured temperature s nonrepresentative of the batch as a whole . This problem can be circumvented b y Experts share how to choose analytical tools and techniques when scaling up a lyophilization process. An industry roundtable moderated by Stephanie SuttonLyophilization: How to Meet Scale-Up Challenges Using QbDPharmaceutical Technology JULY 2012 75Troubleshooting using controlled ice nucleation. However, although this technique is available in both laboratory and production equip-ment, it is not routinely used in manufac-turing. Hopefully, this will change in the near future. There are also indirect ways to measure batch average temperature, such as manometric temperature mea-surement or, particularly, TDLAS, that could be used in manufacturing, but so far, this is not common practice. SCALE UP PharmTech: What are the key challenges and potential factors to consider when planning to scale up a lyophilization process? Gieseler (University of Erlangen-Nurem- berg): Examples of challenges include differences in environmental factors (e.g., non-cGMP versus sterile environ- ment) and the different freezing behavior of the product solution in manufactur-ing. Other challenges are differences in equipment design and performance, such as emissivity of the surfaces, con-denser performance, shelf cooling/con-trol performance, vacuum control capa-bilities and choked-flow conditions, and a lack of appropriate tools to monitor the freeze-drying cycle. However, the above-mentioned chal- lenges can be overcome if operational qualification testing is performed on pilot-production equipment during a factory test or installation at the cus-tomer site. Performance testing can be conducted using a predefined freeze-dryer load (i.e., water or excipient solu-tion) at various shelf temperature and pressure-over-time profiles. Mayeresse (GSK Biologicals): During the early development of a new product, the final facility is not necessarily defined and a product may also be transferred to another factory or CMO. For good scale up, it's important to know the final freeze dryers in which the product will be lyophilized. However, as this is not al-ways possible, the best method is to de-fine a design space that is large enough to transfer towards in the worst-case scenario, such as an in-house industrial freeze-dryer. Nail (Baxter Pharmaceutical Solutions): Per- haps the biggest mistake development scientists make when developing freeze- drying cycle conditions is to conduct trial cycles using too few vials, in which most, or all, of the vials are in the \"edge effect,\" where vials close to the edge dry at a faster rate than vials in the center of the array. We always use at least one full shelf of product for trial cycles. If there is not enough drug available for this, we use placebo for most of the vials, and put the vials containing active in the center of the vial array. In addition to this, we consider differ- ences in equipment capability between laboratory- and production-scale equip-ment, such as lowest attainable shelf temperature, fastest attainable shelf temperature, ramp rate under load, low-est attainable vacuum, and so forth. Page/Steiner (GEA Pharma Systems): Sci- ence and risk management must form the basis of the scale-up process. The impact of changes in heat and mass transfer with scale and equipment de-sign can be measured and predicted by applying basic process engineering techniques. If the process equipment is not properly characterized and under-stood, then scale-up will be a trial and error process. Where the equipment has been properly characterized, how-ever, there is no reason why the scale effects should not be reasonably esti-mated and validated. Pikal (University of Connecticut): There are differences in heat and mass transfer that may constitute scale-up problems. These issues need to be addressed by doing operational qualification testing under conditions of defined thermal and mass-transfer load, perhaps using TDLAS, so that the capabilities of each dryer are known. Thus, a process can be designed with this constraint in mind. However, the major scale-up issue is the bias in ice nucleation temperature between freezing in a standard labora-tory or pilot laboratory, and that char-acteristic of the Class 100 environment of a production facility. An easy way to circumvent this issue is to use controlled ice nucleation. In fact, even with the ex-tensive knowledge we have now, good freeze-drying practice must include controlled ice nucleation.PharmTech: What recent advances are being made in heat and mass transfer theory? How might breakthroughs in this area be applied to more effective scale-up using a QbD approach? Mayeresse (GSK Biologicals): There are several good mathematical models that can be used, and some have been ap-plied to freeze dryers to facilitate cycle development. One of the benefits of mathematical models is that they can support the thinking behind the physi-cal aspect of the freeze-drying process. These models are a simplification of the reality and allow for better under-standing of the underlying rules. In the future, more specific models based on other mathematical theories may arise that will offer more accurate insight into process development. Such models will surely improve the scale-up process in freeze drying. Nail (Baxter Pharmaceutical Solutions): I don't think any real advances are being made in heat and mass transfer theory, because both disciplines are already very mature, but there are ad-vances being made in application of this theory to freeze drying. In particular, the industry has realized the relative importance of thermal radiation as a heat-transfer mechanism. This un- derstanding could result in changes in equipment design and construction that take better advantage of thermal radiation, resulting in a more efficient process. Pikal (University of Connecticut): I would maintain that the physics of heat and mass transfer, which is quite relevant to the design and control of primary dry-ing, is relatively well understood. There may well be advances in applications, including using heat and mass transfer theory to assess in a quantitative fash-ion the impact of natural variation in key freeze-drying parameters (i.e., heat transfer coefficient, ice nucleation tem-perature, fill volume, and shelf tempera-ture variation) on product quality (i.e., thermal history, collapse, and degrada-tion). Indeed, some efforts in this area have started. Use of theory in scale-up is also underutilized, and application guidelines are needed. PT76 Pharmaceutical Technology JULY 2012 PharmTech.comThe authors, part of the International Consortium on Innovation and Quality in Pharmaceutical Development (IQ Consortium), explore and define common industry approaches and practices when applying GMPs in early development. A working group of the consortium aims to develop a set of recommendations that can help the industry identify opportunities to im prove lead time to first- in-human studies and re duce development costs while maintaining required quality standards and ensuring patient safety.

Position Paper: Early Phase GMPs The International Consortium on Innovation and Qual- ity in Pharmaceutical Development (IQ) was formed in 2010 as an association of over 25 pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with a mission to advance science-based and scientifically-driven standards and regula-tions for medicinal products worldwide. In the June 2012 issue of Pharmaceutical Technology , a paper was presented which described an overview of IQs consolidated recommendations from the Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) in Early Development working group (WG) (1). The focus of this IQ WG has been to develop recommended approaches on how to apply GMPs in early phase CMC development activities cover-ing Phase I through Phase IIa. A key premise of the GMPs in Early Development WG is that existing GMP guidances for early development are vague and that improved clarity in the definition of GMP expectations would advance innovation in small-molecule pharmaceutical development by improving cycle times and reducing costs, while maintaining appropri-ate product quality and ensuring patient safety. A consequence of the absence of clarity surrounding early phase GMP expectations has been varied in interpretation and application of existing GMP guidances across the in-dustry depending on an individual company's own culture and risk tolerance. Internal debates within a company have frequently resulted in inappropriate application of conserva-tive \"one-size-fits-all\" interpretations that rely on guidelines from the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) that are more appropriate for pharmaceutical products ap-proaching the point of marketing authorization application. In many cases, erroneous application of these commercial ICH GMP expectations during early clinical development does not distinguish the distinct differences in requirements between early development and late-stage development (Phase IIb and beyond). A key objective of this IQ WG, therefore, has been to collectively define in early development\u2014within acceptable industry practices\u2014some GMP expectations that allow for appropriate flexibility and that are consistent with existing regulatory guidances and statutes (2).GMPs for Method Validation in Early Development An Industry Perspective (Part II) Donald Chambers, Gary Guo, Brent Kleintop, Henrik Rasmussen, Steve Deegan, Steven Nowak, Kristin Patterson, JULY 2012 77As outlined in the previous introductory paper, the efforts of the GMPs in Early Development WG have focused on the fol-lowing four areas of CMC activities: analytical method valida-tion, specifications, drug-product manufacturing, and stability. The initial scope of these efforts has been limited to small-mol-ecule drug development which supports First in Human (FIH) through Phase IIa (Proof-of-Concept) clinical studies. A series of papers describing a recommended approach to applying GMPs in each of these areas is being published within this journal in the coming months. In this month's edition, the authors advocate for a life-cycle approach to method validation, which is iterative in nature in order to align with the evolution of the manufacturing process and expanding product knowledge space. A pharmaceutical industry collective perspective on analyti- cal method validation with regard to phase of development has not been published since 2004 (3). Genesis of the 2004 paper occurred during a set of workshops sponsored by the Ana-lytical Technical Group of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) in September 2003. The referenced paper summarized recommendations for a phased approach to method validation for small-molecule drug sub-stance and drug products in early clinical development. Al-though a few other reviews on method validation practices have been published (4), this paper provides a current, broad-based industry perspective on appropriate method validation ap- proaches during the early phases of drug-product development. This broad industry assessment of method validation also uncovered the need to clearly differentiate the context of the terms of \"validation\" and \"qualification.\" Method qualification is based on the type, intended purpose, and scientific under-standing of the type of method in use during the early develop-ment experience. Although not used for GMP release of clinical materials, qualified methods are reliable experimental methods that may be used for characterization work, such as reference standards and the scientific prediction of shelf-life. A perspective on some recent analytical method challenges and strategies, such as genotoxic impurity methods, use of ge-neric methods, and methods used for testing toxicology materi-als or stability samples to determine labeled storage conditions, retest periods and shelf life of APIs and drug products are also presented. The approach to method validation described herein is based on what were considered current best practices used by development organizations participating in the IQ consor-tium. In addition, this approach contains some aspects which represent new scientifically sound and appropriate approaches that could enable development scientists to be more efficient without compromising product quality or patient safety. These science-driven acceptable best practices are presented to pro-Table I: Summary of proposed approach to method validation for early- and late-stage development.

The views expressed in this article are based on the cumulative industry experience of the members of the IQ working group and do not reflect the official policy of their respective companies. Early-phase method parameters requiring validation In early development, one of the major purposes of analytical methods is to de-termine the potency of APIs and drug products to ensure that the correct dose is delivered in the clinic. Methods should also be stability indicating, able to iden-tify impurities and degradants, and allow characterization of key attributes, such as drug release, content uniformity, and form-related properties. These methods are needed to ensure that batches have a consistent safety profile and to build knowledge of key process parameters in order to control and ensure consistent manufacturing and bioavailability in the clinic. In the later stages of drug de- velopment when processes are locked and need to be transferred to worldwide manufacturing facilities, methods need to be cost-effective, operationally viable, and suitably robust such that the methods will perform consistently irrespective of where they are executed. In considering the purpose of methods in early versus late development, the authors advocate that the same amount of rigorous and extensive method-validation experiments, as described in ICH Q2 Analytical Validation is not needed for methods used to support early-stage drug development (5). This approach is consistent with ICH Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice , which advo- cates the use of scientifically sound (rather than validated) laboratory controls for API in clinical trials (6). Additionally, an FDA draft guidance on analytical procedures and method validation advocates that the amount of information on analytical procedures and methods validation necessary will vary with the phase of the investigation (7). IQ's perspective regarding which method parameters should be validated for both early- and late-stage methods is summarized in Table I. In this table, identification methods are considered to be those that discriminate the analyte of interest from compounds with similar (or dissimilar) structures or from a mixture of other compounds to assure identity. This category includes, but is not limited to identification methods using high-performance liquid chroma-tography methods are used to quantitate the major component of interest. This category includes, but is not limited to drug assay, content uni-formity, counter-ion assay, preservative's assay, and dissolution measurements. Impurity methods are used for the determination of impurities and degradants and include methods for organic impurities, inorganic impurities, degradation products, and total volatiles. To further differentiate this category of methods, separate recommendations are provided for quantitative and limit test meth-ods, which measure impurities. The category of \"physical tests\" in Table I can include particle size, droplet distribution, spray pattern, optical rotation, and methodologies, such as X-Ray Diffraction and Raman Spectroscopy.

When comparing the method-validation approach outlined for early develop- ment versus the method-validation studies conducted to support NDA filings and control of commercial products, parameters involving inter-laboratory studies (i.e., intermediate precision, reproducibility, and robustness) are not typically performed during early-phase development. Inter-laboratory studies can be replaced by appro-priate method-transfer assessments and verified by system suitability requirements that ensure that the method performs as intended across laboratories. Because of changes in synthetic routes and formulations, the impurities and degradation products formed may change during development. Accordingly, related substances are often determined using area percentage by assuming that the relative response factors are similar to that of the API. If the same assumption is used to conduct the analyses and in toxicological impurity evaluation and qualification, any subsequent impurity level corrections using relative response factors are self-corrective and hence mitigate the risk that subjects would be exposed to unqualified impurities. As a result, extensive studies to demonstrate mass balance are typically not conducted during early development. In addition to a smaller number of parameters being evaluated in preclinical and early development, it is also typical to reduce the extent of evaluation of each parameter and to use broader acceptance criteria to demonstrate the suitability of a method. Within early development, the approach to validation or qualification also differs by what is being tested, with more stringent expectations for methods supporting release and clinical stability specifications, than for methods aimed at gaining knowledge of processes (i.e., in-process testing, and so forth). An assess-ment of the requirements for release- and clinical-stability methods follows. Defini-tions of each parameter are provided in the ICH guidelines and will not be repeated herein (5). The assessment advocated allows for an appropriate reduced testing regimen. Although IQ advocates for conducting validation of release and stability methods as presented herein, the details are presented as a general approach, with the understanding that the number of replicates and acceptance criteria may differ on a case-by-case basis. As such, the following approach is not intended to offer complete guidance. Specificity . Specificity typically provides the largest challenge in early-phase meth- ods because each component to be measured must be measured as a single chemical entity. This challenge is also true for later methods, but is amplified during early-phase methods for assay and new formulations are introduced. A common approach to demonstrating specificity for assay and impurity analysis is based on performing forced decomposition and excipient compatibility experi-ments to generate potential degradation products, and to develop a method that separates the potential degradation products, process impurities , drug product excipients (where applicable), and the API. Notably, requirements are less strin-gent for methods where impurities are not quantified such as assay or dissolution methods. In these cases, specificity is required only for the API. Accuracy. For methods used in early development, accuracy is usually assessed but typically with fewer replicates than would be conducted for a method intended to support late-stage clinical studies. To determine the API in drug product, placebo- spiking experiments can be performed in triplicate at 100% of the nominal concen-tration and the recoveries determined. Average recoveries of 95-105% are acceptable Con dence means knowing your inertness is superior.

Learn more at: www.agilent.com/chem/ 624UI ATTAI N SUPERIOR INERTNESS Pharmaceutical Technology JULY 2012 81for drug product methods (with 90-110% label claim specifications). Tighter valida- tion acceptance criteria are required for drug products with tighter specifications. For impurities, accuracy can be assessed using the API as a surrogate, assuming that the surrogate is indicative of the behavior of all impurities, including the same response factor. Accuracy can be performed at the specification limit (or reporting threshold) by spiking in triplicate. Recoveries of 80\u2014120% are generally considered acceptable, but will depend on the concentration level of the impurity. For tests where the measurements are made at different concentrations (versus at a nominal concentration), such as dissolution testing, it may be necessary to evaluate accuracy at more than one level. Precision. For early-phase methods, only injection and analysis repeatability is examined. Area % relative standard deviation (RSD) is typically determined from 5 replicates. Repeatability is determined at 100% of nominal concentration for the API with impurities being evaluated at the reporting threshold using the API as a sur-rogate. Acceptance criteria of 1% RSD (injection repeatability) or 2% RSD (analysis repeatability) for API are frequently targeted. For impurities, higher precision limits (e.g., 10-20%) are acceptable and should consider the level of the impurity being measured (injection and analysis repeatability). For tests where the measurements are made at different concentrations (versus at a nominal concentration), such as dis-solution testing, it may be necessary to evaluate repeatability at more than one level. Limit of detection and limit of quantitation. A sensitivity assessment is necessary to de- termine the level at which impurities can be observed. Using the API as a surrogate, a \"practical\" assessment can be made by demonstrating that the signal of a sample prepared at the reporting threshold produces a signal-to-noise ratio of greater than 10. A limit of quantitation can be determined from this assessment by calculating the concentration that would be required to produce a signal to noise ratio of 10:1. Similarly, a limit of detection can be calculated as the concentration that would produce a signal-to-noise ratio of 3:1. However, it is emphasized that the \"practical limit of quantitation\" at which it is verified that the lowest level of interest (reporting threshold) provides a signal at least 10 times noise and thus can be quantitated, is of paramount importance. Linearity . Linearity can be determined from 3-point calibration curves at test con- centrations of 70, 100, and 130% of nominal (API) for assay or from 3 points ranging from the reporting threshold to 130% of the specification limit for impurities. API is used as the surrogate analyte for impurities. For both analyses, a validation criterion can be established as R 2 > 0.995. For tests where the measurements are needed over broader concentration ranges, such as dissolution testing, a broader linear range may be examined using a 3-point calibration. Range . As for late-phase methods, the range is inferred from the accuracy, preci- sion, and linearity studies. Robustness . Full robustness testing is not conducted during early development. However, an assessment of solution stability should be conducted to demonstrate the viable lifetime of standards and samples. Specifically, solutions should be considered stable when the following conditions are met: t\u0001 The API assay changes by not more than 2% t\u0001 No new impurities greater than the reporting threshold are observedAlthough data needs to be documented, detailed method and validation reports are not required to ensure compliance in early development.

Notably, if validation is performed concurrently with sample analysis as an extended system suitability, solution stability must be assessed separately. This assessment is typically con-ducted as part of method development. Early-phase methods requiring validation During discussions held to develop this approach to early-phase method validation, it was evident that the context of the terms \"validation\" and \"qualification\" was not universally used within all the IQ member companies. To facilitate a common understanding of this approach, the authors will therefore refer to \"validated methods\" as those methods which perform as expected when subjected to the series of analytical tests de-scribed in this approach. \"Qualified methods\" are considered to be analytical methods which are subjected to less stringent test-ing to demonstrate that they are scientifically sound for their intended use. In the following sections, the authors recommend which types of methods typically employed in early develop-ment require either validation or qualification. Methods for release testing and to support GMP manufacturing. In early development, specifications are used to control the qual-ity of APIs and drug products. Consideration of specifications places great emphasis on patient safety since knowledge of the API or drug product process is limited due to the low number of batches produced at this stage of development. Specifica-tions typically contain a number of different analytical tests that must be performed to ensure the quality of the API or drug product. Typical material attributes, such as appearance, potency, purity, identity, uniformity, residual solvents, water content, and organic/inorganic impurities, are tested against established acceptance criteria. The API and drug-product specific methods for potency, impurity, uniformity, and oth-ers should be validated as described above and demonstrated to be suitable for their intended use in early phase development prior to release. If compendial methods are used to test against a specification (e.g., FTIR for identification and Karl Fischer ti-tration [KF] for water content), they should be evaluated and/or qualified to be suitable for testing the API or drug product prior to use without validation. Materials used in the manufacture of GMP drug substance and drug product used for early-phase clinical studies for which specifications are not outlined in a regulatory filing (e.g., penultimates, starting materials, isolated intermediates, reagents, and excipients) need only to be quali-fied for their intended use. Method transfer is less rigorous at this early stage of development and may be accomplished using covalidation experiments or simplified assessments. As mentioned, method qualification is often differentiated from method validation. The experiments to demonstrate method qual-ification are based on intended purpose of the method, scientific understanding of the method gained during method development and method type. It is an important step in ensuring that reliable data can be generated reproducibly for investigational new drugs in early development stages. The qualified methods should not be used for API or drug product release against specifications and concurrent stability studies. However, reference material charac-terization may be done with qualified methods. Generation of process knowledge in early development is rapidly evolving. Numerous samples are tested during early development to acquire knowledge of the product at various stages of the process. The results from these samples are for in-formation only (FIO) and methods used for this type of testing are not required to be validated or qualified. However, to ensure the accuracy of the knowledge being generated, sound scientific judgment should be used to ensure the appropriateness of any analytical method used for FIO purposes. \"Generic\" or \"general\" methods. A common analytical strategy often employed in early development is the use of fit-for-pur-pose generic or general methods for a specific test across mul-tiple products (e.g., gas chromatography for residual solvents). These methods should be validated if they are used to test against an established specification. The suggested approach to validating these methods in early development is typically per-formed in two stages. Stage 1 involves validating the parameters that are common for every product with which the method can be used. Linearity of standard solutions and injection repeat-ability belong to this stage. Stage 2 of the validation involves identifying the parameters that are specific to individual prod-uct, such as accuracy. Specificity may be demonstrated at Stage 1 for nonproduct related attributes and at Stage 2 for product related attributes. Stage 1 validation occurs prior to GMP test-ing. Stage 2 validation can happen prior to or concurrent with GMP testing. This approach to validation of fit-for-purpose methods can provide efficiency for drug development by con-serving resources in the early phases of development and can ensure reliability of the method's intended application. Methods for GTI and tox batch qualification. The need for analytical methods to demonstrate the control of genotoxic impurities (GTI) has developed recently because of expectations and guidances pro-vided by regulatory authorities (8, 9). Often, these methods require high sensitivity with limits of quantitation in the parts-per-million (ppm) range. Although the control levels for GTIs (referred to as the threshold of toxicological concern) is less stringent for early clinical studies (e.g., patient intake < 50 ug/day for clinical stud-ies < 30 days vs 1.5 ug/day for longer clinical studies), regulatory authorities expect that GTI control is demonstrated during early development. Depending on when a GTI is potentially generated during an API synthesis, GTIs may be listed in specifications. Vali-dation of these methods is again dependent upon the intended use of the method. Methods used for assessment may be qualified un-less they are used to test against a specification as part of clinical release. Method qualification is also considered appropriate if the method is intended for characterization or release of test articles for a toxicology study. Methods for stability of APIs and drug products. Batches of API and drug product are typically exposed to accelerated stress Position Paper: Early Phase GMPsPharmaceutical Technology JULY 2012 83conditions and tested at timed intervals to assess whether any degradation has occurred. The shelf-life of the API or drug product\u2014that is, the time period of storage at a specified con-dition within which the drug substance and drug product still meets its established specifications, is based on analytical data generated from these studies. For this application, ana-lytical methods need to be stability-indicating (e.g., capable of detection and quantitation of the degradants) to ensure qual-ity, safety, and efficacy of a drug substance and drug product. Often, the analytical methods used to perform stability tests are the same methods used to test against a specification for release testing; these methods should be validated. However, if additional tests are performed which are not included in the es-tablished specification, they may be qualified for their intended use, rather than validated. In-process testing methods. In-process testing (IPT) during man- ufacturing of drug substance and drug product can be done on-line, in-line, or off-line. The results generated from IPT are used to monitor processes involving reaction completion, removal of solvents, removal of impurities, and blend content uniformity. Manufacturing parameters may be adjusted based on IPT re-sults. IPT methods are often very limited in scope. In early devel-opment, the primary benefit of performing IPTs is the generation of process knowledge, and not as a control or specification. As a result, even though IPT is essential for manufacture of drug substance and drug product, method qualification for an IPT method is appropriate in early-phase development. Documentation and other requirements. The extent of documen- tation and associated practices in early development should be aligned with the appropriate level of method validation as discussed above. In this paper, the authors provide a perspec-tive on the appropriate level of documentation, protocol and acceptance-criteria generation, instrument qualification, and oversight of the quality assurance unit for early-phase method validation and qualification. This approach provides develop-ment scientists with flexibility to efficiently adapt to the dy-namic environment typical within early phase pharmaceutical development, while ensuring patient safety and the scientific integrity of the validation process. With respect to documentation, it the IQ perspective that the raw data which is generated during early phase method validation should be generated and maintained in a compli-ant data storage format. The integrity of raw data should be controlled such that it can be retrieved to address future techni-cal and compliance-related questions. Proper documentation of data and validation experiments should also be considered an important aspect of early phase validation. The availability of electronic notebook (ELN) systems has provided a viable, more efficient alternative to the use of traditional bound-paper notebooks. In developing policies to implement ELNs, the goal should not be that all documentation practices used with paper notebooks are replicated. Rather, the ELN should possess sufficient controls for the intended use of the data. In many cases, electronic systems such as ELNs will transform the work process, and the controls it provides will be achieved in a completely novel manner compared to the outdated system being replaced. Although data needs to be documented as described above, it is the authors' position that formal, detailed method and vali-dation reports are not required to ensure compliance in early development. Adequate controls need to be in place to ensure method parameters used to execute validated methods are equivalent to parameters used during validation. Generation of brief method and validation summary reports are required only when needed to fulfill regulatory filing requirements or to address requests or questions from health authorities. Valida-tion summaries are not required to present all of the validation data, but rather a summary of the pertinent studies sufficient to demonstrate that the method is validated to meet the require-ments of its intended use. Once reports are generated and ap-proved internally, approved change control procedures should be available and followed to maintain an appropriate state of control over method execution and report availability. Although the authors' perspective is that a validation plan needs to exist for early phase method validation, analytical or-ganizations could consider different mechanisms to fulfill this need. For example, internal guidelines or best practice docu-ments may sufficiently outline validation requirements such that a separate validation plan need not be generated for each method. In the absence of such a guideline or procedure, a vali-dation plan could be documented in a laboratory notebook or ELN which includes a brief description of validation elements and procedures to be evaluated. Validation plans should ensure that the method will be appropriate for its intended use. The use of strict validation criteria within the validation plan should be limited at these early stages of development. Validation studies for early development methods may be performed on fit-for-pur-pose instruments which are calibrated and maintained, but not necessarily qualified or under strict change-control standards. The role of the pharmaceutical quality system and the over- sight over early phase method validation practices and docu-mentation is another area for consideration. In the pharmaceu-tical industry, quality management is overseen by a \"Quality Unit\" that qualifies and oversees activities in the areas of GMP materials such as laboratory controls. In practice, the size and complexity of the Quality Unit overseeing GMP manufacturing varies based on a manufacturer's size and stage of drug devel-opment. Regardless, the basic aspects of a quality system must be in place. In early development, IQ's position is that, because API and drug-product manufacturing processes are evolv-ing, the analytical methods do not yet require full validation as prescribed in ICH Q2. Correspondingly, the quality system implemented during early phases could consider that evolving analytical methods are intrinsic to the work being performed to develop the final API and drug product processes and could allow flexibility to readily implement method changes during early development. For example the Quality Unit should del-egate oversight for validation plan approval, change control, ap-proval of deviations and reports to the analytical departments prior to finalization and performing full ICH Q2 validation 84 Pharmaceutical Technology JULY 2012 PharmTech.comof the analytical methods. This approach would be consistent with Chapter 19 of ICH Q7 A. However, analytical departments must ensure that early phase validation studies are conducted by qualified personnel with supervisory oversight who follow approved departmental procedures. Clearly, agreements be-tween Quality Units and analytical departments to implement an appropriate strategic, phase-based quality oversight system would provide many benefits within the industry. Conclusions Within this paper, IQ representatives have presented an industry perspective on appropriate requirements and considerations for early phase analytical method validation. A suggested outline of acceptable experiments that ensure analytical procedures devel-oped to support API and drug product production of early phase clinical materials are suitable for their intended use has been pre-sented. Additionally, the authors have provided a position on phased approaches to other aspects of method validation such as documentation requirements, generation of method valida-tion plans, validation criteria, and the strategic involvement of quality unit oversight. When applied appropriately, this approach can help to ensure pharmaceutical development organizations provide appropriate analytical controls for API and drug product processes which will serve the ultimate goal of ensuring patient safety. Although the extent of early-phase method validation ex-periments is appropriately less than employed in the later stages of development, we view that any risks related to this approach will not be realized, especially when considering the overall qual-ity and safety approach used by pharmaceutical companies for early phase clinical studies. It is the authors' hope that providing such an approach to early-phase method validation, along with the approaches outlined in this series of early-phase GMP papers, will serve as a springboard to stimulate discussions on these approaches within the industry and with worldwide health authorities. T o encourage further dialogue, this IQ working group is planning on conducting a workshop in the near future to promote robust debate and discussion on these recommended approaches to GMPs in early development. These discussions will ideally en-able improved alignment between R&D development, Quality, and CMC regulatory organizations across the pharmaceutical industry, and most importantly with worldwide regulatory au-thorities. Agreement between industry and health authorities regarding acceptable practices to applying GMPs in the early phases of drug development would clearly be beneficial to CMC pharmaceutical development scientists and allow for a more nimble and flexible approach to better address the dynamic environment typical of the early phases of clinical development, while still guaranteeing appropriate controls to ensure patient safety during early development.

Register online at PharmTech.com and click on \"Multimedia: Webcasts.\" EXCIPIENTFEST AMERICASRoundtable: Visible Particles Background A primary cause of drug recalls during the past year has been the presence of visible particles, that is off-colored particles or black or tan specs, in pharmaceutical products. The presence of visible particles affects both excipients manufacturers and users with re-gard to standard expectations for mitigating the atypical visible particles and with regard to decision-making about raw material acceptance criteria. The International Pharmaceutical Excipients Council (IPEC) is working to develop and fast-track a guideline on how to measure and properly assess the significance of these visible particles, particularly within white polymer powders. The guideline is meant to dispel any confusion around the presence of particles in excipients and to provide information for excipients users and makers on how to proceed when making decisions about these particles. The following is an edited transcript of a roundtable discussion that took place in April 2012 at the IPEC/ExcipientFest Americas conference in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Featured panelists are listed at left. Q&A with panelists PharmTech: When elevated temperatures are used with organic substances for drying or solvent removal, these temperatures, even though they're beneficial for solvent removal and reduction of bioburden, can actually char the white powder materials and leave the so-called black specs. Could you comment on this and what other manufacturing or processing techniques may cause these visible particles? Schoneker (Colorcon): Probably the most common cause of the particles that everybody sees is charring. There are various points in the process where it's going to get charred and turn a little bit brown or black, and there are various points where there's motion, or compression, that over time will form such particles. It's impor-tant to understand that these particles are inherent to the excipient manufacturing process and always will be. There are also errant particles, particles that you don't typically see that show up and probably need a different level of assessment. What IPEC really wants to talk about with the industry is zero tolerance (that is, absolutely no visible particles in the excipient material). Zero tolerance should not be the goal because it's un-realistic. What we're trying to do (with the IPEC guideline) is to Atypical Visible Particles An Industry Roundtable on How Users and Makers Can Best Assess and Manage Black Specks Moderated by Angie DrakulichPharmaceutical Technology JULY 2012 87figure out how to look at the particles that are inherent versus the particles that are not inherent, and how one can come up with procedures and controls to deal with each type. Right now, there is no regulatory guidance on this subject, and everybody is assuming that every particle is atypical\u2014or not inherent\u2014when in fact, they are. This is creating a lot of controversy throughout the industry. Carter (IPEC): To add to that, if you have an abrasive product going through stainless-steel pipes and other things, you're going to scour that product. When you have big crystallizers and large dryers, there is buildup. Even in crystallizations, the color can be just how the crystal formed. It may appear slightly different in color than the next particle. Trying to remove these aesthetically un-pleasing specks should not be the industry's main interest. What should be focused on is identifying the reasonable state of art for individual products, following GMP, and separating those occa-sional off-colored materials from real contamination. PharmTech: Because there are no existing guidelines about how to handle these visible particles, the user's discovery of black specks in raw materials can in many cases lead to an entire batch of mate-rial being rejected. Currently, how does one distinguish between the normal specks that may be formed during the manufacturing process and potentially harmful foreign contaminants? Van Meter (IPEC): From an excipient manufacturer point of view, we work very closely with customers to analyze the particles. About 80 to 90% of any particles that I have analyzed that are returned from a customer are off-colored polymer. Unfortunately, when you're dealing with pure white powders, it is common to have these very, very small dark particles, and even though they're very small in number, they do stand out. I understand that they cause alarm; but again, 90% of them are purely the listed polymer. Schoneker (Colorcon): From an excipient user perspective, we've learned that most companies don't talk to their suppliers about these particles. Instead, all kinds of analyses are done to prove that a charred particle is something it's not. Users then have tons of data and still don't know what to do about the particles and they end up rejecting the batch. The supplier, however, could probably explain why the par- ticles are there, what they are, and how they control them. For example, a supplier might say, 'If the particles are brown, that's normal and you probably don't have to do a whole lot of analyses unless you have some reason to think it's something else. If the specks are purple, however, you need to go to the next step in analysis.' The missing link here is communication. PharmTech: When such a batch rejection occurs based on atypical visible particles, that decision affects not only cost but also the sup-ply chain, and potentially can lead to a drug shortage. What are your thoughts on this? Van Meter (IPEC): Yes, very few particles can cause the rejection of an entire batch of materials. But I'd like to clarify that when we're talking about these particles, we're not talking about something that is pervasive or gross, we're talking about just a very, very few micron-size particles in an entire batch of mate-rial. At a customer location, if those are seen at receipt, then the entire batch could be quarantined and shipped back. As an excipient manufacturer, that rejection incurs tremendous cost because the material has already been manufactured and shipped. Then you have to bring the material back and perform an appropriate disposition; there's often no rational thought as to why the material was rejected. Sometimes, the recipient decision is just visual\u2014 'I see black specks; I can't accept this lot.' The alternative is for the user to take a controlled approach to call the material manufacturer, do the appropriate investiga-tion, and release the material. PharmTech: FDA does not have an official position on this subject yet, but are there any visible particles that are consid-ered acceptable in raw materials today or should everything be ruled out? Buhse (FDA): As an agency, we want to know that you un- derstand what product you're making, so that you know what is or isn't acceptable.... There are risk-based, science-based decisions that you need to make as the manufacturer of the final drug about what you can tolerate in your incom-ing raw materials, including the excipients. So if you have particles, we would look to see that you understand what they are. Perhaps it's as simple as having a discussion with your supplier and being able to explain to the agency what the particles are and why they are not a risk to public safety or patient safety, which is our prime concern. Risk manage-ment, good science, and always keeping the safety of the patient in mind is what we're looking for. Schoneker (Colorcon): In the food industry, there's a guideline on acceptable filth that specifically states how many insect parts are okay, how many wings are okay, and how much dirt can be present. Now we don't necessarily want to go there in the pharma industry, but, again, the concept that FDA can't find a particle to be acceptable is not true. FDA on the food side has been saying that for decades, and a certain amount of particles, if you will, is the reality. We just need to figure out for our industry what we can do in a reasonable way. The Speakers Roundtable session on atypical visible particles at IPEC/ExcipientFest Americas 2012 in San Juan. 88 Pharmaceutical Technology JULY 2012 PharmTech.comPharmTech: Can you provide some insight into the pending IPEC guideline on atypical visible particles in excipients and its goals? Van Meter (IPEC) : We have a subteam in which excipient manu- facturers are looking at what a responsible manufacturer in full GMP compliance would need to do to provide a high degree of assurance to customers (excipient users). The manufacturer needs to be able to tell the customer that it has the issue under control, that it has minimized the particle occurrence to the greatest extent possible, and that it can communicate with them about this topic. The next phase of our plan is the user phase. Users will need to have a subteam where they look at issues such as, 'What do we do upon receipt? If we see a black particle, do we automatically reject?' And in some cases, users will need to re-examine their decision-making procedures in this regard. Ultimately, we hope to bring together the responsible manufac- turing point of view from the maker's side and the responsible ac-ceptance procedures on the user's side, all with the focus on patient safety. Once we have what we consider a good guideline, we hope to sit down with FDA and review it with them to gain acceptance and move forward. Schoneker (Colorcon): To be clear, from the point of the IPEC Executive Committee, this guideline is not meant to give manufacturers the ability to avoid high quality standards. If you have a belt that is shearing pieces into the product\u2014the resulting specks are not inherent. That problem needs to be fixed and GMP practice must apply. PharmTech: The IPEC guideline may suggest taking a customer complaint about specks being found in excipient materials and using that complaint to perform a risk assessment. Can you pro-vide some more detail on what's planned? Van Meter (IPEC): The way that we think a good manufacturer should behave in this regard is that you need both a feed-for-ward and a feed-back risk assessment. The feed-forward risk assessment involves having documentation of the process that details where these types of particles may be formed. Then a company can perform a review or a mitigation when they are found. We also want a feed-back risk assessment, which means that when a manufacturer gets a customer complaint, you can take the particles, analyze them, and look back in the manufacturing process to see where the particle may have been generated. That risk assessment should then be updated as necessary. In addition, I'd like to make a comment about testing and how we can learn how to mitigate some of these issues. We get asked all the time about whether our sample plan covers vis-ible particles. The answer is, you sample, and you evaluate your samples for particles of any kind that would be atypical. How-ever, when you're looking at a performance level, even if you're generating off-color particles, in many cases, you're looking at performance levels of 6, 7, 9 Sigma, and beyond. So anything that you can grab a sample of, you can ensure yourself that if you have an off-color particle that may end up in a final product, you're going to catch it.PharmTech: From FDA's perspective, what is your take on the IPEC approach discussed so far? Buhse (FDA): This is a conversation that's going back and forth between manufacturers of excipients and the users of the excipients because perhaps the communication has not been there between those two groups, and I think this guideline will really help move that communication forward so people understand the excipients that they're using and then can use the good science they need to decide what to do moving forward. And then they can have a better understanding of what 'out of normal' is because, obviously, if an excipient does come in and you are used to 2 particles in 200,000 kilos and one day it comes in as 10 particles out of 200,000 kilos, that raises a red flag. You need to have the ability to call your supplier and talk about it. And maybe they already know that the particles are there, or maybe it's something completely different, and you both need to go back and do a complete CAPA and take a look at perhaps that pipe that needs to be replaced because it's 25 years old, and so forth. And if you aren't communicating, then perhaps some material could get into the market that maybe should have been stopped had there been better communication. Overall, it's a good place for both the suppliers and the users to start talking and figuring out what they want to put in this guide-line. As an agency, we're happy to take a look at the guideline when a good draft exists and see what we think. PharmTech: There is clearly frustration on both sides, user and maker, with this issue. What types of dialogue do you think need to happen beyond what's already taking place? Carter (IPEC): There's got to be an understanding of how products are made, their capabilities, and how they are used. The makers of excipients have concerns over their own intellectual property. In making excipients, you don't typically, for equipment or certain processes, patent them. This confidentiality is what gives a certain company an ability to make a certain product of a certain quality. But companies have to get beyond this frame of mind in order to talk about sources. They have to build a quality partnership. This dialogue, however, needs to start in the development process when companies are choosing excipients. Early conversations are key. Van Meter (IPEC): Having this guidance in place will provide the safe environment that not only says it's okay for these particles to exist, but that also encourages makers and users to talk about this issue because, as we have has alluded to, it's been there all along. When you have these discussions, not only do you build a much higher degree of trust, supplier to maker, but you also avoid panic. Buhse (FDA): [These ideas about dialogue] support a lot of the ini- tiatives that the agency has been pushing, such as quality by design and understanding better how raw materials affect the final prod-uct. So it can only help to be having that communication between manufacturers and users and being able to understand the vari-ability in your raw material and how then you can make sure that that variability in your raw material can be taken care of in your own manufacturing process so that the end product is potentially less variable or at least will no longer have a high probability of being rejected down the road. PTRoundtable: SOLUTIONS PharmTech.com/statsPharmTech.com/stats PHOTODISC/GETTY IMAGES Homogeneity or uniformity of a dose formulation is a require-ment for ensuring integrity of regulated preclinical safety studies. Demonstrating homogeneity ensures that the preclinical dose formulation contains active ingredient(s) uniformly throughout the formulation, thereby ensuring that the test system is being administered using the appropriate amount of test material. Accurate as-sessment of dose formulation homo-geneity is accomplished by using an appropriate sampling protocol and validated analytical methodology. Assessment Assessing homogeneity for preclinical dose formulations is generally com-pleted by sampling the prepared pre-clinical dose formulation at various strata in the formulation container. Sampling from the top, middle, and bottom followed by analysis using a validated analytical method is an ex-ample. Homogeneity is established by sampling from the initial preparation at both the lowest and highest dosing concentrations. Confirmation of ho-mogeneity ensures that the formula-tion preparation procedure is adequate for the study. Homogeneity of a preclinical dose formulation can be affected by multiple factors, including, but not limited to: t\u0001Batch size or volume t\u0001Mixing methods t\u0001Uniform particle size of the test article t\u0001Vehicle composition. Homogeneity should be reassessed when there is a significant change in the batch size. For instance, if 100 mL of a for-mulation are prepared for the first study and 1000 mL are prepared for a subse-quent study, homogeneity is performed on both batches. These tests ensure that the formulation process at each scale yields a homogeneous mixture. The need for these two processes is based on mix-ing techniques, because different methods are used depending on batch size. Once homogeneity has been estab- lished using a specific formulation procedure, it is crucial to maintain consistent methods for preparation throughout the study. Minor changes may affect the ability to prepare and maintain a homogeneous mixture. Challenges Challenges with homogeneity can vary depending on the type of formulation. There are multiple types of dose for-mulations used for in vivo studies, in- cluding, solutions, suspensions, and solids as described below: t\u0001Solutions by definition are ho- mogenous because all components dissolve in the solvent. If solubility data in the specified vehicle at the highest specified concentration do not exist, it is crucial to confirm that the dosing formulation is in fact a solution; therefore a homo-geneity assessment is required for the preclinical study. This assess-ment is a regulatory requirement by FDA for preclinical safety stud-ies. It ensures that assumptions based on visual observation or solubility information in another solvent other than the vehicle do not compromise the outcome of an in vivo study. t\u0001Suspensions, where not all com- ponents are dissolved, require ad-ditional attention to ensure that the components are evenly dis-tributed and remain distributed throughout the course of dosing. This assessment may require extra steps, such as continuous stirring or heating, while dosing. Suspen-sions that are stored prior to dos-ing may require extended stirring or heating to ensure homogeneity of the formulation prior to dosing. t\u0001Solid-dose formulations, includ- ing gels, creams, and feeds, add additional challenges to establish-ing and maintaining homogeneity. Adequate mixing and blending are even more important when pre-paring a solid formulation. Regu-larity of particle size is key to feed blends because small amounts of test article are being added and Uniform dose formulation is key to meeting safety study requirements.How to Assess Preclinical Dose Formulation Homogeneity Amy Smith and Melissa Whitsel Amy Smith is director, and Meli ssa Whitsel is analytical manager, both with MPI Research; head quarters located at 54943 North Main Street, Matta wan, MI 49071.Once homogeneity is established, it is crucial to maintain consistent methods for preparation. Pharmaceutical Technology JULY 2012 91Analytical Solutions mixed to relatively large amounts of feed. Several tactics may be used to improve solid homogene-ity, including sieving or grinding of the test material prior to adding to the feeds, or dry blending the test article with a secondary sub-stance prior to addition of feed. Spray-dried techniques used in the manufacturing of marketed products are typically not feasible because of scale and frequency of preparation needed for a preclini-cal study. Examples As noted, assessing homogeneity for preclinical dose formulations is typi-cally assessed by analyzing samples taken from the top, middle, and bot-tom of a formulation batch using a vali-dated analytical method. Two samples are removed from each stratum, for analysis resulting in a sampling size of n=6. The sample results are compared with standard acceptance criteria for precision (percent relative standard de-viation or % RSD). Typical acceptance criteria are featured in Table I.On rare occasions, homogeneity as- sessments fail and it is necessary to modify the procedure for the prepa-ration of a dosing formulation. For example, a feed study being dosed at 1 mg/g produced the following homoge-neity results: The variability observed in Table II indicated the possibility that the material was not sufficiently mixed or the test article was not uniform. Homogene-ity was improved significantly by grinding the test article in a pestle with a mortar, followed by sieving the material to ensure uniformity prior its addition to feed. A second example of a failed homo- geneity assessment involved a suspen-sion. A test batch was prepared prior to the study to establish an appropriate preparation procedure. Analysis of the test batch indicated that the material was homogeneous. However, analysis of the initial study batch indicated the dose formulation was not homoge-neous. Observed differences between the test and study batch were batch size, mixing techniques (related to batch size), and lot of test article. Following an extensive investiga- tion, it was determined that the lot of test article adversely affected homo- geneity. The test articles used in the preparations were sourced from two different manufacturers; the one used for the study batch was not of uniform particle size. To prepare a homogenous dose formulation using the second lot of material required grinding with a mortar in a pestle and then using a sieve to ensure uniform particle size. In another example, a dose formu- lation suspension prepared in 0.5% aqueous methylcellulose, required several modifications prior to success-fully preparing a homogenous dosing formulation. In this instance, multiple test batches were prepared using vari-ous homogenization and sonication times. The final preparation required dry grinding of the test article using a pestle and mortar. The material was subjected to additional grinding after the addition of small volumes of vehicle to form a smooth paste. The remaining volume of vehicle was added and the formulation was mixed for 5 min using a Silverson homogenizer, sonicated for 30 min and then stirred for 1 h. Subject-ing the formulation to extensive mixing and sonication were required to prepare a homogenous material. Conclusion The preparation of a homogeneous dosing formulation is a critical com-ponent of any preclinical study. Ho-mogeneity depends upon various fac-tors, including batch size, mixing and blending techniques, and particle size. Accurately determining homogeneity depends upon standardized sampling techniques and using appropriate ana-lytical methodology. If possible, the use of test batches prior to study initiation can go far in predetermining homogeneity. If the preparation methodology is appropri-ate, it can facilitate successful study execution.

A much simpler regionalized supply base has evolved into complex global supply chains. In the late 1970s, most purchases were from domestic, even relatively local sources. Companies had personal relationships with whom they were buying from, and as result, t h e y w e r e a b l e t o m a n a g e r i s k o n a personal basis. Purchasers knew the character of their major suppliers and understood their financial health. It was easy to ensure that every purchase came from a select pool of suppliers. The biggest supply risks were of a much dif-ferent nature, such as temporary labor strikes or mechanical breakdowns of shippers. It was easy to compensate for these and other basic supply risks by carrying extra inventory of in-process and finished goods. Most organiza-tions had at most, dozens of suppliers, not the thousands of suppliers as most companies do today. In 1977, I was a young laboratory technician for a manufacturer that made power-steering hoses for the automotive industry. That was the year that early personal computers were first mass-pro-duced for consumer sales, including the Commodore PET (Personal Electronic Transactor) with either four or eight ki- lobytes of memory, Apple II, which be-came an instant success with its printed circuit motherboard, and Tandy Radio Shack's first desktop computer TRS-80 with four kilobytes of memory and an early microprocessor. The year 1977 also was the beginning of the US prime interest rate ascent from 7.75% in September 1977 to an all-time high of 21.5% in December 1980. (Today, it is 3.25%.) It was a time of rapid tech-nology growth and unpredictable finan-cial stability. Both of these forces were key drivers of 35 years of procurement transformation. My earliest memory of what was then called the purchasing department was that \"they were the folks standing in between what I wanted to buy and the supplier I wanted to buy it from.\" But what a change we have witnessed since: purchasing to procurement, a highly tactical function to a valued strategic business partner. Transformation in procurement I have been lucky to have spent more than 20 years in procurement working for companies and leaders who were truly transformational, including in my role as vice-president of procurement, global systems and operations for GlaxoSmith-Kline (GSK). Working for GSK and other companies gave me a chance to be a part of tremendous change. Reflecting on the total experience, there are five areas that have driven the purchasing evolution to the procurement revolution: value to the organization, skills development, tech-nology, best-practice adoption, and or-ganizational design.Value to the organization . Thirty-five years ago, the typical purchasing depart-ment reported low within the company's overall reporting structure. It was a tacti-cal operation whose basic function was commonly known as \"place and chase,\" that is, call in an order and expedite the delivery. Today, the function is known as the procurement organization and typi-cally reports directly to the CFO, head of supply chain, or COO. We are even beginning to see a new trend where the chief procurement officer reports to the CEO and is a board member. Skills development . In the late 1970s, the primary skills required of purchasing per-sonnel was the ability to handle multiple tasks in a fast-paced environment. It also helped if one were a \"leveraged buyer\" and was good at haggling. Most supplier selec-tions had already been made by engineers, facility managers, and other end users be-fore purchasing was contacted. The com-mon hand-off to purchasing ended with a comment, such as \"see if you can get a few more dollars off.\" Now, companies actively recruit seasoned procurement profession-als with impressive resumes and proven track records of taking significant cost out of third-party spend. Also recruited are new graduates from the ever-increasing colleges and universities that have under-graduate and graduate degree programs focused on the supply chain. Technology. Three and a half decades ago, purchasing technology consisted of the three-ply traveling requisitions and a telephone for ordering. When doing a detailed purchasing analysis, we were armed with a sharp pencil, lined paper, and a basic calculator.

By the mid- to late 1990s, the first P2P (procure-to- payment) systems were available that au-tomated the full cycle of requisitioning, approvals, ordering, tracking, receipt, and payment. Next to arrive was technol-ogy that allowed procurement to do on-line bidding (i.e., reverse auctions). Today, procurement technology has evolved to significantly improve process efficiencies (less headcount required), automatically analyze spend (identifies more savings opportunities), drive incremental savings (bottom-line impact), and enable effec-tive control and contracting of critical spends (risk management). New solutions now allow organizations to compete bet-ter by using a true marketplace approach that automatically does the bidding and negotiation for the buyer. Solutions that perform combinatorial optimization for complex global spends result in new levels of savings and end-user satisfaction. Best-practice adoption . In the late 1970s, best purchasing practices were more associated with good inventory- management processes. The purchasing focus was on how to work with suppliers to receive goods just-in-time with suppli-ers owning the inventory until needed by the manufacturing line. I was associated with some of these early, difficult efforts that often were performed just-in-case because the risks were just too high to not keep adequate inventory on hand. By the mid 1990s, procurement began adopting a new best practice, strategic sourcing, a seven-step disciplined pro-cess that ensured well-defined specifica-tions, requirements, supplier and market knowledge, and a competitive process used for bidding and negotiation. With each passing year, more procurement analytics and strategy have been used to continually make improvements to the acquisition process, overall cost benefits, and total value provided. Best practices also have been developed for supplier management and supplier relationship management that focuses on getting ever- increasing value from the supply base be-yond simply savings. Organizational design. When I was start- ing out, purchasing departments were fragmented, decentralized functions that primarily existed to ensure that goods and services were delivered on time. During the past 15 to 20 years, a new model evolved and perfected where a central procure-ment group establishes common policies, procedures, and technology that allow cor-porations to develop the appropriate local, regional, or global strategies to maximize savings and value from the supply base. In closing, the past 35 years have wit- nessed a remarkable transformation for the organization tasked with managing a com-pany's overall third-party expenditure. The evolution of purchasing to procurement has allowed corporations to enhance prof-itability in new ways. With a best-practice procurement organization in place, more dollars are dropped to the bottom line, and incremental value is elicited from the sup-ply base on an ongoing basis.

D'Ambra, Chairman, CEO, & President of AMRI PharmTech: How has the increasing focus on biopharmaceuticals af- fected your business? D'Ambra: The changes in how pharma is considering outsourcing are key reasons we rolled out our new AMRI SMARTS OURCI NG offering, which is designed to provide customers with the ability to customize AMRI's resources, technologies, geo- graphic footprint, and record of accountability and accom- plishment to create an ideal offering to meet the needs of their research programs, without the need to compromise on quality, productivity, or timeliness. AMRI SMARTS OURC- ING also means that we have inst ituted a number of internal initiatives at improving our performance and customer service, and we have invested in consolidating resources to meet customer preferences. Therefore, the increased focus on biopharmaceuticals may affect overall industry demand, but we emphatically believe that AMRI is well positioned to benefit from new trends emerging from the tough times of the past couple of years. PharmTech: How will the industry remain innovative as it reduces spend- ing on research? D'Ambra: The strategic use of outsourcing is a more innovative ap- proach to R&D initiatives. It is likely that some of the reasons for the poor productivity of the recent past in pharma have had to do with a failure of leadership and accountability within these large organizations. If an outsourcing provider is not meeting the needs of its client, the relationship is going to end, the client will find someone else, and the rep- utation of the outsourcing provider is going to suffer. The Darwinian nature of this accountability is a great catalyst to drive performance. The strong organizations survive and continue to gain market share and the beneficiaries of this are the pharma and biotech companies that make choices based on which outsourcing provider has the resources, talent, and capabilities to best help them succeed without compromise.

This scalability feature of CFRs is appealing for circumventing nonscaling problematic chemistries in a timely fashion. It is not uncommon for there to be one or more steps in an initial discovery synthesis that is not amenable to batch processing. When this occurs, significant time, effort, and money have to be invested in process research and/or development to resolve the chemistry or retool the synthesis. CFR technology, on the other hand, offers the potential to scale the existing problematic chemistry to overcome the bottleneck. For example, Johnson and Johnson (New Brunswick, NJ) dem-onstrated the utility of CFR technology for rapidly scaling gram to kilogram quantities of early-stage clinical trial API where batch processing was a concern (4). Several classes of reactions that presented safety or hazardous concerns for batch manufacturing were shown to scale efficiently, safely, and with shorter process research times. The reaction classes reported by the Johnson and Johnson group included exothermic reactions, reactions at elevated temperatures, reactions with unstable intermediates, and reac- tions involving hazardous reagents (4). Implementing CFR technology in an otherwise batch process to resolve early scalable issues provides an attrac- tive strategy for expediting early-stage process development. Under this mixed \"batch-CFR\" paradigm, the problematic step (s) can be optimized to a CFR early on in the process allowing the chemistry to be readily scaled from grams to kilograms. Manufacturers of continuous CFRs such as Corning (Corning, NY) make smaller scale reactors that can be used for optimiz-ing the continuous-flow chemistry on a small scale and employing the smaller reactor to make the desired product on a scale of grams to about a kilogram. When larger-scale production is required, the chemistry is readily transferred to an identical larger reactor simplifying the technology transfer process from laboratory scale to plant scale. Consequently, the \"Batch-CFR\" approach has the potential to be more expedient and cost effective as it takes advantage of CFR technology's ability to scale existing chemistry that is not suitable or safe for larger-scale batch processing. CFR technology may also allow the CM O to scale reactions beyond the capacity of their fixed reactors as an alternative to doing a technology transfer to another facility with larger fixed reactors. The contract manufacturer will still likely use fixed equipment to process the continuous-flow reaction maelstrom. Although significant gains have been made in in-process monitoring and continuous crystallization, at the present time, it is more expedient for early-stage continuous flow reactions to be worked-up using traditional methodology such as filtration, extraction, solvent removal, and crystallization in fixed equipment. If the pro ject moves to commercialization, particularly in the hands of a large pharmaceutical company, the process is more likely to become a fully optimized continu- ous process from start to finish. With a \"Batch-CFR\" process, this transition should be facilitated sin ce the more challenging chemistry has already been adapted to CFR technology. The decision by a CM O to implement CFR technology to resolve a process scale-up issue is a critical risk decision requiring buy-in from the sponsor client. The technology holds significant promise for efficient and cost-effective development of early-stage cGMP processes. The \"Batch-CFR\" approach provides a much greater probability for scaling the initial discov- ery synthesis directly, thereby requiring significantly less process research and development work. CFR technology, however, requires different strate- gic thinking and technical expertise compared with classical batch manu- facturing. Because most drug-development professionals are classically trained, there is likely to be some natural resistance to implementing CFR technology in early-drug development. This mindset has been referred to as \"batch mentality (5). However, with FDA and the pharmaceutical industry encouraging the shift to CFR technology, contract manufacturers are likely to follow suit. Sources 1. A. Pellek and P . Van Arnum, Pharm.

In 2007, the Novartis-MIT Center for Continuous Manufacturing was established with $65 million in funding from the drug company. The center is proposing a \"Blue Sky\" concept where there is a continuous process from the start of a chemical synthesis through final pharmaceutical dosage form (1, 2). The Blue Sky program is an ambitious goal but is gaining ground rap- idly among thought leaders in the pharmaceutical industry and US Food and Drug Administration. Consequently, the momentum for this concept is likely to have a trickle-down effect for contract manufacturers (CMOs) that design and develop early-stage manufacturing processes for clients devel- oping innovator small-molecule drugs. Continuous-flow technology Continuous-flow technology involves the continuous introduction of a stream of chemical reactants into a flow or microreactor to yield a desired reaction product on a continuous basis. The versatility and usefulness of continuous-flow reactor (CFR) technology is expanding rapidly with an ever broadening scope of applicable chemistries and the development of new flow technologies (3). Champions of continuous-flow technology cite a wide range of potential advantages compared with traditional batch manufacturing of pharmaceuticals. In general, the greater optimization and control achievable with CFR technology can translate to significant sav- ings in time and costs and can have a favorable safety and environmental impact. Furthermore, the small-reaction volume, broad operating pressure and temperature ranges, and mixing efficiencies of flow reactors extends the repertoire of chemistries beyond that of the safety and technical limita- tions of batch reactors. The capital investment for CFR technology is also substantially less, as is the footprint required in the plant than a similar capacity batch-reactor system. However, even though the potential advan- tages of CFR technology can be significant, the technology is currently not applicable or practical in all situations. Early-stage development Adapting CFR technology to early-stage development projects has sig- nificant merit, but also significant challenges. CMOs work with numerous sponsor clients, diverse chemistries, and projects in all stages of develop- ment. Many of the projects CMOs encounter are very early stage with the development candidate being licensed out of an academic laboratory or coming directly from the sponsor company's discovery laboratories. These early-stage projects more often than not require various degrees of process research and/or process development to make the discovery synthesis amenable to current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) scale- up. Also, to receive additional funding or secure a development partner, the sponsor company has a strong sense of urgency to enter the clinic and achieve proof-of-concept as soon as possible. This puts pressure on the CMO to rapidly develop a scalable process to meet the near-term active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) goals of the sponsor company and at the same time enable the process to further scale-up to meet later stage API demands. Small-molecule drug development processes are typically in the range of six to eight synthetic steps. Given the time constraints and level of technical challenge, the design of an initial six to eight step totally continuous-flow process for an early-stage drug development project is generally not practical and is typically reserved for established commercial processes. CFR technology, however, does offer the distinct advantage of Contract Manufacturing and Continuous Flow Reactor Technology for Early-Stage Drug Development James Hamby Have you been featured in Pharmaceutical Technology ?

John Castellani, President and CEO,Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) \"Polio and HIV/AIDS diagnoses were once con- sidered death sentences. Today, polio is cured and HIV/AIDS is considered a manageable, chronic condition for many patients. Is there more work to be done? Absolutely, and that is what we do every day. \"Although we have tackled many health challenges, the industry is con-stantly looking to the future. We know that millions more wait and hope for the next medical advancement to help prevent, treat, or finally cure painful, debilitating and even deadly condi-tions. Our mission is to create those innovative new life-improving and life-saving treatments. In fact, last year alone, 35 new, innovative medicines re-ceived FDA approval\u2014one of the high-est totals in the past decade. There are also more than 3200 new medicines to treat a wide range of conditions in clinical trials or under FDA review, up from 2400 six years ago. The industry can also take pride in the fact that it continues to make crucial investments in the future even in the midst of eco-nomic turmoil. \"The biopharmaceutical research industry is America's cradle of innova-tion.
