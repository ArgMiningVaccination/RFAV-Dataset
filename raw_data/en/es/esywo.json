Types, characteristics, and possible side effects of COVID-19 vaccine [ GAVI The Vaccine Alliance](https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/how-safe-are-covid-19-vaccines) [How safe are - - Pfizer both are based on mRNA technology new-type vaccines. There has not been a record of public use before the new crown epidemic, but they have undergone more than ten years of research and development. RNA is responsible for copying, transmitting, and deducing the genetic code of DNA in cells. mRNA (messenger RNA) is a type of RNA (there are three types of RNA: mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA), which is responsible for conveying messages to cells and instructing the cells to make what protein. The mRNA vaccine uses this principle to encapsulate the mRNA of the replicated new coronavirus in nano-lipid particles and inject it into the human body. The cells will begin to produce an outer membrane of spinous protein similar to the new coronavirus, which then triggers an immune response and produces antibodies. The mRNA vaccine cannot enter the center of the nucleus of human cells to contact the DNA, and it will not change the DNA. The viral RNA will disintegrate within 72 hours and will not remain in the human body. Johnson & Johnson AZ both are based on non-replicating adenovirus vaccine vector (adenoviral vector vaccine, is the use of \"harmless, a modified virus\" as a carrier having \"an antigen for producing\" genetic material DNA is transferred to the instruction In human host cells, the nucleus transcribes this DNA into RNA, and the RNA transforms into mRNA. The mRNA allows the somatic cells to start producing viral spike proteins, triggering an immune response and producing antibodies. The non-replicating and modified virus itself does not have the new coronavirus antigen (thorn protein), nor can it replicate the virus in the body. The principle is to allow the body to produce new coronavirus antibodies through a one-time simulated infection (not causing disease). Regarding the cause of thrombosis in the vaccine, there are research papers that have not yet been tested on humans : [Thesis link](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-558954/v1) [UDN Yuanqi Net-Scientific Health Care / ArticleThe latest research reveals: why the adenovirus vaccine may cause thrombosis, mRNA vaccine But not?](https://health.udn.com/health/story/121833/5502479) Adenovirus vector vaccines produce spike protein mRNAs of different lengths and different combinations through DNA transcription. Some of them have free and soluble spike protein variants, which may be combined with ACE2 of vascular cells along with the blood circulation. Coupled with the participation of antibodies, it is possible to cause thrombosis. mRNA vaccine - and - adenovirus vector vaccine What is the difference mRNA vaccinedirectly uses replicated viral mRNA (instruction to make viral spike protein). The mRNA is very weak, short-lived, and difficult to preserve. It will be eliminated by the cell within about 72 hours after entering the human body. adenovirus vector vaccineuse \"harmless and modified adenovirus\" as a carrier, and then put a piece of RNA or DNA that makes the viral spike protein into the adenovirus gene sequence. This modified virus is not a new coronavirus, and* it does not have a new coronavirus antigen (spine protein). It will also use mRNA to allow somatic cells to make spine protein by themselves. adenovirus vector vaccine are more stable than mRNA vaccine and can be stored at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C for 6 months, which is more conducive to long-term storage and transportation. Can trigger a strong immune response. The development of vaccine technology is relatively mature. The manufacturing process is more complicated. mRNA vaccine advantage is that it *does not contain live virus components, has a lower manufacturing cost and can be manufactured more quickly. However, the storage conditions are more demanding, and it must be frozen at low temperature (Modena below -20\u00b0C / 6 months, Pfizer-70\u00b0C / 1 year). It is a new type of vaccine, and there has never been a license for human administration (LICENSE) before the new crown epidemic. Unlike traditional vaccines (whole virus vaccines ..Protein subunit vaccinesadenovirus vector vaccine - and - mRNA vaccine both are based on \"antigen-free\" , allowing somatic cells to produce antigens without actually being infected and causing disease (new crown The coat spine protein of the virus), which triggers an immune response.

The side effects after vaccination are usually manifestations of innate immunity. Cells send alarms through chemical substances to notify that foreign bodies have invaded. White blood cells and macrophages are dispatched to eliminate foreign bodies. The body produces inflammation such as swelling, heat, pain or fever. The innate immune response is the first line of defense, which can maintain combat effectiveness for several hours to several days. Acquired immunity is the second line of defense. It takes several days to several weeks to activate. It is a joint attack by T cells and B cells in the lymphatic system to allow the body to produce long-lasting memory adaptive immune responses and antibodies. The next time it will be the same. Invasion of pathogens, acquired immunity will respond quickly. [ USA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Weekly / February 26, 2021](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7008e3.htm) US Centers for Disease Control study programs for more than 1.6 million people 2020/12/14 - 2021/1/13 / or Pfizer has applied Modena hit the side effects of the vaccine, the data show * strong or weak innate and acquired immune responses are not necessarily The immune response is related. More than 90% of people have an acquired immune response, but less than 50% have an innate immune response (side effects), and most of them are mild.. In other words, it is not possible to determine whether the body has acquired immune mechanisms based on side effects. Even if there are no adverse reactions, most vaccines are still working. ** [Side effects of the new crown vaccine: BBC reporters personally experienced and explored the scientific reasons](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/science-56441922) [Doctor Huang ZoNing's Health LectureThe mRNA vaccine has three differences: manufacturing method, mobility, incidence of side effects and intensity.](https://youtu.be/8ER2shQcbps) [The truth about AZ vaccine thrombosis?

[Doctor Huang ZoNing's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rs9dY1b7jk) Within 2 weeks after the vaccine is given, I recommend not to use essential oil massage, bathing or high-concentration scenting, or sniffing essential oil molecules, so as not to affect the effect of the vaccine and the body's immune response. During this period , it's better * take high-quality balanced diet, relax , and sleep well *, let the body has enough nutrients to produce antibodies. Seek medical attention as soon as possible if there are serious adverse reactions. Hydrosols are the macromolecules and water-soluble components of aromatic herb plants which are separated and extracted by distillation . These hydrosols , such aslavender, orange blossom, chamomile and linden,* are suitable for external application, aloe vera gel or spray moisturizing during this period.
