Social distancing and other preventive measures like - frequent hand washing, wearing a face mask can reduce the rising infection rate of COVID-19. It is not feasible to maintain social distancing and ensure hand sanitization in public places by humans as COVID-19 can affect that person or be contaminated by him/her. An automated social distancing system will play an essential role in maintaining social distance within certain boundaries. An automatic social distancing system called \"COV-SSDS\" has been proposed in this work. In COV-SSDS, a person has to disinfect the hands with a sanitizer after being detected by the infrared sensor because the servo motor control door does not open without hand sanitization. If the person does not stand in the proper place, he/she will be notified. A liquid crystal display module has been used to display the number of people in the queue and the occupied slots. An alert generation system to alert the people about occupying the empty slot and a power backup unit was also attached to this system which was not found in previous studies. According to the features, feasibility, maintenance, and cost analysis, \"COV-SSDS\" is worthy of the previous works.", "sitename": "ieeexplore.ieee.org", "date": "2023-08-27", "cleaned_text": "A not-for-profit organization, IEEE is the world's largest technical professional organization dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity.\u00a9 Copyright 2023 IEEE - All rights reserved.
