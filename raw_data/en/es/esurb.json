Tax also deducts depreciation on its up-front, one time meter radio module installation-related costs. A 30.7% Schedule M income modification is also made to remove the expected portion of each monthly payment that represents the meter radio module equipment which is being depreciated. Book deducts its monthly automated meter reading cost payments as incurred. Books does not recognize AIC as the deemed owner of the meter radio modules. Under the provisions of IRC Section 162 and the Regulations there under, AIC is deducting currently maintenance costs that were capitalized for book purposes. These costs are incurred in CWIP. In- service amounts are included in Plant Temporary Differences.The expenditures were capitalized to electric production accounts - generally accounts 350 - 373. Per Reg. Sec. 1.163-4(c)(1) - if bonds are issued by a corporation and are subsequently repurchased by the corporation at a price in excess of the issue price plus any amount of original issue discount deducted prior to repurchase, or minus any amount of premium returned as income prior to repurchase, the excess of the repurchase price over the issue price adjusted for amortized premium or deducted discount is deductible as interest for the taxable year.Loss on reacquired debt is amortized over the remaining life of the debt issue.
