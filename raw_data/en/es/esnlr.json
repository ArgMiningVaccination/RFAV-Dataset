An annual tradition since 1970, the conference has provided opportunities for thousands of students to present talks, performances, posters, exhibits, and displays on their research and creative endeavors. WKU has a rich history of scholarly engagement of students. Scholarly activity has been defined as original and creative work that is shared with colleagues and the general public. Research is a form of scholarly activity that involves the discovery of new knowledge. Other forms of scholarship include the development of new technologies, methods, materials or uses; the integration of knowledge that leads to new understanding; and artistry that creates new insights and interpretations.* As demonstrated by the Student Research Conference, students significantly enrich their academic experiences at WKU by engaging in scholarly activity. Between 1970 and 2002, the WKU chapter of Sigma Xi organized and funded the WKU Student Research Conference. Sigma Xi is a national research honor society of scientists and engineers that recognizes scientific achievement. The society is a diverse organization of members and chapters dedicated to companionship in science and engineering and advancement of knowledge through research, teaching, and service. For the next three years, the conference was jointly sponsored and organized by Sigma Xi and the University Honors Program. In 2006, WKU hosted a weekend-long celebration of student scholarship that included the Potter College Undergraduate Conference on Friday and the annual WKU Student Research Conference on Saturday, the latter again sponsored by Sigma Xi and the University Honors Program. The following year, a special committee comprised of representatives of each college, the University Honors Program, and Sigma Xi organized the conference. In 2006-2007 Sigma Xi and the Office of the Provost provided financial support for the conference. In 2008 Provost Barbara Burch created the Student Research Council, a university-wide committee charged with promoting student scholarly activity on campus and organizing the annual student conference. Since that year, the Student Research Council has organized the annual Student Research Conference, with financial support provided by the WKU chapter of Sigma Xi, the Office of the Provost, the Office of Research, and other university units. With support from the Office of the Provost and the Office of Research, in 2012 the Student Research Council developed a weeklong celebration of student scholarship. This year REACH (Research Experiences and Creative Heights) Week spanned March 17-22 and featured a keynote address, in conjunction with the WKU Cultural Enhancement Series and the Gatton Academy for Math and Science, by noted physicist * Weiser, C. J. (1996, March 7). The Value System of a University: Rethinking Scholarship. Retrieved 30 November 2010 at www.adec.edu/clemson/papers/weiser.html 6 Dr. Michio Kaku. REACH Week also featured research showcases hosted by nine WKU colleges and units. The Student Research Conference is the culminating activity of REACH Week. CONFERENCE HIGHLIGHTSCONFERENCE HIGHLIGHTS With 383 research presentations, the 44th Annual WKU Student Research Conference is, by far, the biggest in the events history. There are 185 oral presentations and 198 posters/exhibits, plus eight spotlight performances. A total of 281 undergraduate students and 102 graduate students are presenters this year. In addition, 65 students are co-primary authors and 144 are secondary authors. The interdisciplinary nature of the conference is evident in the broad range of subject areas covered in the presentations. Student participants represent diverse disciplines from 47 departments, programs, and institutes in all colleges. Accounting African-American Studies Agriculture Allied Health Applied Physics Institute Architectural & Manufacturing Sciences Art Biochemistry Biology Business Sciences Center for Gifted Studies Chemistry Communication Communication Sciences & Disorders Computer Information Systems Computer Science Diversity & Community Studies Economics Educational Administration, Leadership, & Research Engineering English Family & Consumer Sciences Finance Folk Studies & Anthropology Gatton Academy Gender & Womens Studies Geography & Geology Health Services History Honors College Institute for Citizenship & Social Responsibility Journalism & Broadcasting Kinesiology, Recreation, & Sport Management Marketing & Sales Mathematics Modern Languages Nursing Philosophy & Religion Physics & Astronomy Political Science Popular Culture Studies Psychological Sciences Psychology Public Health Social Work Teacher Education 7 Among the undergraduate participants in the conference are 111 Honors College students.

In 2012 the Office of Academic Affairs and the Office of Research initiated an internal funding program for undergraduate students called Faculty-Undergraduate Student Engagement (FUSE) grants. FUSE grants are designed to support students intellectual development by fostering active engagement in the areas of research, creative and scholarly activities, and/or artistic performances. Nearly 200 under-graduate students have received FUSE grants over the past two years, many of whom are among the conference participants this year. Also, the WKU Graduate School provides grants to graduate students to support creative scholarship that promotes inquiry and contributions to knowledge. A number of the graduate students presenting today were assisted by funding from the Graduate School. STUDENT SPOTLIGHTSTUDENT SPOTLIGHT This year the Student Research Council is pleased to spotlight the creative works of several undergraduate students. The performances will be held in GRH Auditorium and are open to the entire campus community; this is a swipeable event for WKU students. Dr. Gordon Baylis will make introductory remarks. In the most eclectic year yet for the Spotlight for Creative Activity and Performance, these presentations represent five different departments from across WKU. We begin by exploring the contrast between two poems: one collaborative and therapeutic, the other creative and cultural. After the creative readings, the collection takes a visual turn with video and photo presentations. Performance pieces close the hour with a DNA extraction demonstration and an a capella performance. 9 Creative Writing Gerontology - Cherita Black Cherita Black is a WKU Honors College student, a Psychology major, and Gerontology minor from Springfield, Tennessee. Cherita is a recipient of the F.U.S.E grant mentored by Dr. Dana Burr Bradley, the director of the Center for Gerontology. Cheritas F.U.S.E grant research formed the basis for her honors thesis, \"Life Narratives and Poetry-Writing with Older Adults.\" Cherita investigated narrative life reviews and poetry-writing as an alternative approach to improving the social well-being of older individuals. Cherita will briefly present the methodology and recite each poem created with an elder. Poetry - Haley Edwards Haley Edwards is a senior Creative Writing/Arabic double major at WKU. Her work attempts to navigate Southern childhood and spiritual growth throughout travels in the Middle East. It seeks to find common ground between these various cultures which seem so inextricably linked within the poet herself. Fiction - Katie Pickens Katie Pickens is a senior from Owensboro. She is a creative writing major and literature minor. In Fall 2012, she was one of four WKU students selected to receive a scholarship for a Winter Writing Workshop led by Gurney Norman. She wrote her first novella, Tumors, this past semester\u2014Fall 2013. It was the longest and most challenging story shed taken on. It was also the most rewarding piece of writing shes ever completed. She has a journalism background, but switched majors to see if she was any better at writing about people in complex ways that felt more natural to her. Creative non-fiction - Ashley Coulter Ashley will read [wrote this too] from her original creative nonfiction [+ FREE lies] collection, to be published as an Honors Thesis this semester. His selected piece -\"Delay\" - extends a not-so-subtle intro[quack]tion to the collections theme -Whats n[ot]orm[e]al? Quack like duck, get it? Ash will start Teach For America this fall in Indianapolis. Presentations Film - Jayme Powell Jayme Powell, a film major from Bowling Green, will present her film Epiphany and discuss the filmmaking process from concept to post-production. Jayme wrote, produced, and directed the film in spring 2013. Her interest in dreams led her to question what it would be like if someone realized they were dreaming and tried to control the outcome. The film is a look at the concept of lucid dreaming. This past fall, Jayme studied abroad at Harlaxton and over winter term she participated in a 10 faculty-led study away course that went to the Sundance Film Festival. Jayme has worked on several productions outside of WKU and is writing, producing and directing a second film this semester called Scripted. Her mentors are RonDeMarse, Ted Hovet, and Travis Newton. - Jabin Botsford Jabin Botsford is a senior photojournalism and sociology student at WKUHe has interned at The New York Times, The Washington Post and in the summer of 2014 will be interning at The Los Angeles Times. In October of 2013 he was a student at The Eddie Adams Workshop XXVI. He has been recognized by Pictures of the Year International, the College Photographer of the Year, The William Randolph Hearst Photojournalism Award program, the National Press Photographers Association, the Kentucky News Photographers Association, The Atlanta Photojournalism Seminar, and many others. His images and multimedia have been published in The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, AARP, and numerous other publications throughout the country. Biology - Bobby Voyles Bobby Voyles, a biology major from Owensboro, will present an innovative experiment \"Banana DNA in a bag,\" to illustrate the importance and prevalence of molecular biology in our daily lives, and also discuss how the scientific thought process is an integral part of our lives. Through this creative activity at SRC, Bobby is seeking to showcase how research can be a fun activity while answering crucial questions about life. Bobby is an active undergraduate research student who won both a FUSE grant and BSURE grant to pursue research in plant molecular biology. Bobby's attends WKU-Owensboro, and his faculty mentor is Dr. Chandra Emani. A capella ensemble - The Redshirts The Redshirts are the premier male vocal ensemble at WKU! But that sounds too extravagant; these are a group of ambitious young men who love music, performance, hanging out with each other, and love to share their music with the community. The Redshirts sing repertoire from Doo-wop, Standards, Contemporary, and Choral, to Musical Theater, Jazz and Pop. Their wide repertoire and performance capabilities are what makes this mens a capella group so unique! These young men are continually seeking new ways to positively entertain as well as inspire young men to keep singing and expressing themselves. Twitter: @thewkuredshirts, Email: thewkuredshirts@gmail.com and Facebook: The WKU SPEAKERCONFERENCE SPEAKER Dr. Shea is a paleoanthropologist whose research focuses on the archaeology of human origins. His interests span the length of the Paleolithic period. These include early hominid adaptive radiations, the origin of Homo sapiens, the extinction of the Neandertals, and the end of the Later Stone Age in Africa. He has investigated these subjects through projects in Israel, Jordan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Kenya. His most recent fieldwork focuses on Later Stone Age sites in the Early Holocene Galana Boi Formation, West Turkana, Kenya. This latter work is being carried out in conjunction with the Turkana Basin Institute and in collaboration with Prof. Elisabeth Hildebrand. He is an expert flintknapper and skilled replicator of primitive technologies. He uses the results of stone knapping and tool use experiments to improve archaeological methods for reconstructing human behavior through the analysis of stone tools. His most recent research in this area focuses on the origins of stone projectile point technology. Dr. Sheas presentation is open to the entire campus community and is a swipeable event for WKU students. It is sponsored by the WKU chapter of Sigma Xi.
