These days, \"meditation\" has become a buzzword in the wellness community \u2014 but what is meditation exactly? And what are the benefits of meditating? Meditation is the process of focusing and thinking deeply, connecting the mind, body, and spirit in a state of reflection, awareness, and relaxation. [Archeologists estimate](https://www.news-medical.net/health/Meditation-History.aspx) the practice dates back to around 3,000 BC! Today, people meditate with or without the influence of religion, and the practice has many physical, emotional, and spiritual advantages.

Crystal meditation helps you understand your crystal's energies, benefits, and connection to you. By clearing your mind and opening your heart, the universe finds space to bring you divine wisdom through your crystal. More importantly, you strengthen your intuition, helping you discover the strength and insight within yourself. If that sounds good, you're ready to learn how to work with crystals during meditation! So, what crystals do I meditate with? Choosing the Right Meditation Stone When picking out your meditation crystal, the best rule of thumb is to follow your intuition. If you feel drawn to a stone, trust your gut! However, you can also choose your stone(s) based on whether their healing properties match your goals. In that vein, which gemstone is good for meditation? It depends on your crystal's uses. Beginners can start with an [essential meditation crystal set](https://www.zenluma.com/product/essential-crystal-wand-set/) of amethyst, rose quartz, clear quartz, and obsidian. Let's go over why each crystal is great for meditation! Clear Quartz Known as the \"Master Healer,\" [clear quartz](https://www.zenluma.com/blog/crystals/quartz-crystal-healing-properties/) is the best stone for crystal beginners to find their footing. Meditation with clear quartz brings your spirit to its highest level, keeping distractions away to infuse your session with peace and [crystals for concentration](https://www.zenluma.com/blog/crystals/crystals-for-focus/). If you're setting intentions, clear quartz is the best crystal for helping you manifest them. It's also a powerful amplifier, perfect for combining with other crystals to strengthen their power. Amethyst [Amethyst](https://www.zenluma.com/blog/crystals/amethyst-meaning-healing-properties-ancient-powers/) takes the cake for spirituality and tranquility! Its healing properties bring divine wisdom, insight, and love. Using amethyst for meditation strengthens intuition and promotes metaphysical gifts like foresight and astral projection. Once you know how to meditate with amethyst, you're ready to embrace its purifying, calming, and inspiring energies in every area of your life! Rose Quartz For emotional matters, [rose quartz](https://www.zenluma.com/blog/crystals/rose-quartz-meaning-healing-properties-uses/) is the best healing crystal. Nicknamed the \"Stone of Unconditional Love,\" rose quartz brings openness, empathy, and self-love. Its celestial, loving vibrations help close the wounds of heartbreak and invite new opportunities for romance or friendship. Pro-tip on how to meditate with rose quartz: As you inhale, imagine breathing in the crystal's joyous, loving energy, and allow it to fill your heart with reassurance. Obsidian [Black obsidian](https://www.zenluma.com/product-category/crystals/black-obsidian/) is a great meditation crystal for quieting a troubled or overactive mind. It also supports you during difficult transitions and [new beginnings](https://www.zenluma.com/product/new-beginnings-crystal-wand-set/), encouraging you to learn from mistakes rather than being defined by them. When using obsidian for meditation, it's important to be open to seeing your strengths and weaknesses. When you surrender guilt and pride, obsidian can help you experience honest self-reflection and growth. These examples are by no means the only options. Every healing crystal offers unique benefits that can enhance your meditation, and you can even combine crystals for intensified power. Regardless of which crystal you choose, the next step is learning how to use it during meditation! How to Meditate with Crystals There are many meditation methods, from guided visualization to mindful mantras. You can even try some more ancient practices like chakra meditation \u2014 which we'll cover later! But before you begin, you need to prepare your crystals. Cleanse Your Crystals First If you buy a new crystal and want to charge it with a new intention, or you use it to absorb negative energies, you need to cleanse it. Built-up energies can \"clog\" your stone's healing abilities over time, making it less effective. Cleansing clears out that build-up, creating a fresh path for the crystal's energies to find you. Now, you're probably wondering [how to cleanse your crystals](https://www.zenluma.com/blog/crystals/how-to-cleanse-your-crystals/). Here are some tried-and-true methods: - Moon Bath. Leave your crystal(s) outside under the moonlight for 2-3 hours or overnight. [Smudging](https://www.zenluma.com/product/cleansing-smoke-essentials/). Burn sage or Palo santo and circle the smoke around the stone. - Salt. Bury the crystal in a shallow bowl of sea salt and leave for 2-3 hours or overnight. [Selenite](https://www.zenluma.com/product-category/selenite-2/). Place your crystal(s) on a [selenite bowl](https://www.zenluma.com/product/selenite-heart-healing-bowl-4/)or around a selenite stick](https://www.zenluma.com/product/large-selenite-sticks/). Leave for 24 hours. [Mists](https://www.zenluma.com/product-category/cleansing/sprays-mists/). Lightly spritz a cleansing mist over your crystal(s) and let them air dry. Some cleansing ingredients for your mist are sage, rose water, or witch hazel. With your crystals cleansed, it's time to meditate! How to Meditate with Crystals: Step-by-Step There aren't explicit rules on how to meditate properly; it's a personal and adaptable experience. The goal is to unwind and focus on personal growth. However, if you don't know where to start, we'll lay out the basic steps! Step 1: Find a quiet, relaxed space. Your meditation space could be a bedroom, backyard, or even your car! If you set a designated area for regular meditation, try your best to keep it decluttered and free of visual distractions. If you can, silence or turn off your phone and any other devices where notifications can distract you. Step 2: Find a comfortable position to sit in. Here's the 411 on how to sit when meditating: you don't have to! Many folks with disabilities find typical meditation positions restrictive, painful, or unfeasible. The lotus position might even be uncomfortable for someone without any ailments! When you meditate, you're free to stand, sit, lay down, or even switch positions as you go! Bottom line: Adapt your practice to your needs. Step 3: Hold your crystal or place it in front of you. We recommend making physical contact with your crystal to form a deeper spiritual connection to its healing energies. You can touch it, hold it, or place it on your body (bonus if it's placed on the corresponding chakra area!) But physical contact is not required \u2014 you can have your crystal set somewhere nearby instead if you prefer. Step 4: Focus on breathing deeply. If you're worried about how to breathe while meditating, don't overthink it. You can't really do it wrong! However, certain techniques enhance relaxation and focus while you breathe. Inhale slowly and deeply, feeling your lungs fill up and your stomach expand. You can visualize breathing in your crystal's healing energies. Exhale for a longer time than you inhaled, feeling your stomach move back in. If counting helps you focus, you can inhale for four seconds, hold for seven seconds, then exhale for eight seconds. This is called the 4-7-8 technique. Another technique is the 7/11 method: Inhale for seven seconds and exhale for 11 seconds (if that's difficult, you can also inhale for three and exhale for five). You can look at your crystal as you breathe or close your eyes. Step 5: Think about your crystal, intention, and/or goals. This step will probably change from session to session. You can visualize the crystal's color as a glowing light surrounding you, or visualize [setting an intention](https://www.zenluma.com/blog/crystals/intention-setting-with-crystals-a-complete-guide/) that absorbs into the crystal. Maybe you have a mantra to repeat aloud or mentally. Ten minutes is usually the best length for your crystal healing session; however, listen to your intuition and body's cues to know when time is up. Once you're done, open your eyes (if closed). Slowly move your body around \u2014 stretch out your toes, gently roll your neck back and forth, or make any other movements that feel good. The movement will help you feel recentered and grounded after the session. And that's it! If you want to expand your meditation, check out our tips below! Tips for Maximizing Crystal Meditation Crystal meditation is all about personalization, so we have some pro-tips for taking your session to the next level! Repeat Mantras to Strengthen Your Intention If you're wondering how to [manifest](https://www.zenluma.com/blog/crystals/5-crystals-manifesting-miracles-dreams-and-desires/) while meditating, it starts with an intention. You can make intentions stronger by repeating a mantra! A mantra can be a sound, word, or phrase. Repeating a mantra clarifies your intention, awakens your spirit, and helps manifest goals. Plus, your crystal amplifies that manifestation! To create a mantra, start with \"I\" and follow with a clear intention. For example, \"I will release the past and embrace the future.\" Need some inspiration? [Check out more mantras here](https://www.zenluma.com/blog/crystals/10-best-mantras-for-crystals-healing/)! Incorporate All Five Senses By holding your crystal, your sense of touch is engaged, but what about the rest? You can create a more enriching meditation by incorporating other sensual elements, like: - Smell: Light a [candle](https://www.zenluma.com/product-category/crystal-candles/), burn [incense](https://www.zenluma.com/product-category/cleansing/incense-burner/), or turn on an oil diffuser. We recommend jasmine and lavender scents! - Sound: Some prefer silence, but you can also incorporate sound by using a guided meditation app or turning on some soothing crystal meditation music. - Sight: Low-lighting is recommended, but you can set a mood with colored lights, too! Blue is the most relaxing, while red is stressful and not recommended. - Taste: Sip on some calming jasmine or chamomile tea to fill your body and spirit with warmth. Try Chakra Crystal Meditation Chakra healing is an ancient practice involving the seven chakras, energy centers that correspond to different areas of flowing life energy.
