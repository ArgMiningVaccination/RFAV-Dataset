Payment will vary based on the provider you see and your insurance (if you have insurance). Most integrative medicine doctors are naturopathic physicians but the insurance coverage for their services is limited. While some do have contracts with insurance, Arizona naturopathic doctors have less insurance coverage then say Oregon or Washington naturopathic doctors. However most HSA plans will cover the charges billed from [naturoapthic doctors Arizona](//www.swintegrativemedicine.com/blog/bid/120209/the-benefit-of-using-naturopathic-doctors-arizona).

By work, we mean they have scientific validity supporting them. Some treatments have more scientific validity than others. Often times this is because someone has taken the time and resources to fund and research the treatment.
