Child Protection and Forensic Pediatrics - Jacksonville PED E 12J | 4th Year Elective | Pediatrics | Clinical Science Prerequisites 4th year medical student Course Description Course Description: Forensic Pediatrics is the study of child abuse as it relates broadly to pediatrics. Th is elective is both didactic and heavily experiential - co mbining study, lectures, and field experiences. Identification, diagnosis, manageme nt, and policy issues will be a ddressed. At the conclusion of this elective, the senior medical student will have a greatly increased understanding of child abuse and how it is a major component to child and adult health, and a set of skills in its identification. The didactic portion consists of readings in child abuse (book s, articles, CDs, photographic atlases). The student will have field experiences in a clinic seeing physical abuse, sexual abuse and neglect; observe chil d interviews; review current child abuse case records; participate in child abuse consultations on the hospital and observe community activities including DCF investigations, court, law enfo rcement, and child abuse preven tion. There is an opportunity to also observe telemedicine examinations. INTRODUCTION In many primate societies, its smallest and most vulnerable members are both cherished and occasionally abused by adults. Humans also mist reat their young - at a relatively high rate. The statistics about this are many, but a few to consider: 1. Child abuse has been experienced in one form or another by at le ast 30% of the adult population 2. Child abuse is the leading cause of death between 6 months of age and 12 months of age. It is the second leading cause of death betw een 6 months and 12 years of age. 3. Over 90% of prisoners were victims of child abuse; over 90 % of prostitutes were sexually abused as children; and about 70% of adult psyc hiatric outpatients were victims of child abuse 4. It is conservatively estimated that there are an additional 36,000 violent criminals and 250 murders in the US each year because of child abuse 5. Child abuse is conservatively estimated to co st at least $124 billi on per year to society 6. Each case of shaken baby syndrome costs at least $1 million 7. Medical schools in the US t ypically provide 2 hours of form al training about child abuse 8. The CDC states that adverse childhood experiences are the most important health problem in the U.S. The goal of this elective is not to make you a sp ecialist in the area (thi s would require a three year fellowship post residency), but to heighten your awareness as to the diversity and depth of the problem, and to enhance basic skills in identification and interv ention. (At the conclusion, you should be more familiar with child abuse issues than most pediatric residents.) Several key misconceptions that are common among the general public and many physicians include: 1. The primary means to determine if a child ha s been sexually abused is to send her to the doctor for an examination 2. Children can suffer a fair amount of physical abus e or neglect, but will turn out ok if they are then placed in a loving environment 3. Child abuse is an infrequent, abnormal conditio n of humanity and would not be caused by nice people such as themselves Welcome to one of the most interesting, sophi sticated and diverse areas of medicine! The children and adults you care for during the rest of your career will be better because of your insights and the knowledge you obtain.

Endocrinology/Diabetes Clinical Clerkship PED E 8 | 4th Year Elective | Pediatrics | Clinical Science Prerequisites 4th year medical student Course Description Endocrinology Elective: Goals The goal of this elective is to allow the resident or student to acquire sufficient familiarity with common pediatric endocrine problems to deal with them intelligently at the general pediatric level including an appreciation of the range of normal variation in growth and development and when referral to a pediatric e ndocrinologist is indicated. Successful completion of the elective should allow you to approach the pediatric shelf examination with confidence and meet long-ter m professional career goals. By completing the elective in pediatric endocrinol ogy you should not expect to beco me proficient in the field. Nevertheless, by participating in the various activiti es of the division in th e hospital, in outpatient clinics, and in diabetes summer camping and weekend retreat programs, the resident will be exposed to a diversity of pe diatric endocrine problems. In clinic you will work with diabetes educator s, nutritionists, research coordinators, and members of the Psychology department who assist in difficult psychosocial cases. You are encouraged to talk to all pers onnel associated with the multiple aspects of our clinical and research practice to learn more about pediatric endocrinology. You will be expected to interact courteously and professionally with all team members (professionalism, communication). In order to ensure that all residents have adequate exposure to a ll aspects of pediatric endocrinology, residents or student s attending diabetes camp (July or August) will be asked to separate their rotation into 2 week blocks such that they will ha ve 2 weeks of the rotation during a non-camp month. We will work wi th you as well as the chief re sidents and medical school to coordinate your rotation for the be st possible educational experience. The Division of Pediatric Endocrinology has produced a detailed curriculum which will introduce you to the field of pediatric endoc rinology. You will be expected to read the curriculum and engage in further reading/literature searches as needed for patient care and to satisfy your curiosity. You will be given a copy of Styne's Pediatri c Endocrinology to use as your primary reading source during the rotation. This must be retu rned before you complete the rotation. You are strongly encouraged to read this brief review of pe diatric endocrinology in its entirety during your rotation. (PBL, medical knowledge, professionalism). A. Specific Objectives Residents and students taking this elective will be expected to a ttain the necessary skills to mange common pediatric endocrine problems. The endocrine syllabus has been divided into three categories in which different degrees of expertise are expected at the termination of the rotation. These are: Highly compet ent, i.e. the resident should acquire detailed knowledge of the topic and be able to diagnose and manage most patients with this condition and recognize those requiring referral for definitive diagnosis and tr eatment. Competent, i.e. the student should acquire general knowledge of the condition and be able to diagnose and treat with consultative help. Aware, i.e. the resident or student should be aware of the condition but should refer the patient to the subspecialty serv ice for evaluation and management. 1. Highly Competent Short stature Failure to thrive Obesity Puberty-normal variations Adrenarche Thelarche Gynecomastia Delayed puberty Nutritional rickets 2. Childhood goiter Congenital hypothroidism Acquired hypothyroidism Precocious puberty Cryptorchidism Turner syndrome Klinefelter syndrome 3. Aware Diabetes mellitus in children Education of the family of a newly diagnosed patient Outpatient management Diabetic ketoacidosis Complications of diabetes Adrenal insufficiency Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Hypoglycemia syndrome Growth hormone and th erapy for non-GH deficiency states Thyroid nodules, carcinoma Disorders of the adrenal medulla Adrenal and gonadal tumors Endocrine hypertension Ambiguous genitalia Epidemiology, etiology, and prevention of Autoimmune endocrinopathies Disorders of calcium, phosphate, and Vitami n D (other than nutritional rickets) Parathyroid deficiency states Hyperparathyroidism Metabolic bone disease Neonatal calcium and phosphate disorders Disorders of water balance Diabetes insipidus ( central, nephrogenic) SIADH Hyperlipidemia B. Specific Learning Experiences 1. Inpatient Service You will be expected to follow patients on the inpatient and cons ult services. Student should pre- round on inpatients and consults so that rounds flow smoothly and there is time for teaching. Students are expected to be on time for rounds. St udents are expected to present their patients accurately and concisely. Students are expected to read about their patients and participate actively in rounds. The attending on service will coordinate with the resident and the on service fellow how inpatients and consults will be assi gned. (professionalism, practice based learning, medical knowledge, patient skills). 2. Outpatient Clinics Clinic experiences are available all day M onday, Tuesday afternoon, all day Wednesday, and Friday morning (see Schedule below). Students will be expected to be on time for clinics. Clinic attendance will be the primary focu s of the elective as the majo rity of pediatric endocrinology involves outpatient work-up. Students will be working under the direction of an Attending Physician. Patients will be put into rooms by the Nurse. Take this time to review the chart. Students should refrain from discussing the patien t or reviewing the chart in any general area. Make sure that the door is cl osed in the Clinic Conference Room when patients are being discussed. (PBL, medical know ledge, professionalism) Patients should be seen promptly and courteously. Residents will identify themselves to the patient, obtain the history and perform the physical examination, and present to one of the clinic Attendings who will review the hi story and physical findings with the patient/patient's family. Residents are expected to dictate all Endocrine patients. Students wi ll not be required to dictate. Residents are expected to dictate all new Diabet es patients. Residents and students should fill out a clinic note on returning Diabetes patients, but do not need to di ctate them. Please dictate/write up charts promptly- at the end of the day at th e latest (professionalism , PBL, patient skills). 3. Nutrition In the first week of the rota tion, residents should schedule a se ssion with our nutritionist to discuss the nutritional aspect s of Diabetes and Obesity with a focus on carbohydrate counting and low fat diets (medical knowledge). 4. Diabetes Education In the first week of th e rotation, residents should schedule a se ssion with one of the C.D.E.'s to discuss practical aspects of di abetes management. Attending th e education session for a newly diagnosed diabetes patient is a priority and will be encouraged in lieu of attending clinic. This session should include discussions on the various types of meters, insulin delivery devices, etc. (medical knowledge). 5. Referrals to the Endocrine Service Every Tuesday morning, residents w ill review with the attending the previous week's referrals to the endocrine service. Residents will be expected to make recommendations as to whether/how quickly the new referrals should be seen based on a review of the chart and reading (PBL, medical knowledge). 6. Fellow's Journal club Residents should attend the monthly fellows' j ournal club (Tuesday noon to 1:30PM). Residents will be expected to have read the articles assigned by the attending (medical knowledge, PBL). 7. Fellow's Core Conference Students and Residents are expect ed to attend the weekly Core Conferences (Thursday noon to 1:30) where a didactic lecture wi ll be given by a fellow or attending related to an important topic in pediatric endocrinology. We rec ognize the potential conf lict with the Core le cture series of the Residency Program, so the decision on which lectur e to attend will depend on the lecture topic and the interests of the resident. 8. Student Pediatric Endocrine Presentation The last Thursday of the rotation, students are ex pected to present a 30 minute review of a topic which was of interest during the rotation. The pr esentation should include a short literature review of the topic (P BL, medical knowledge). 9. Endocrine Testing Early in the rotation, residents should acquire a familiarity with provocative hormone testing by observing/assisting with a test. These are usua lly scheduled for Monday and Friday mornings during Endocrine Clinic (PBL, pa tient skills, medical knowledge). 10. On Call Residents/Students will be expected to be on call an averag e of every fourth night during the rotation. Call will be from home. Residents will not directly get phone calls from patients or physicians. These will go to the fellow/attending on call. Residents/students will be notified if the fellow/attending has to go to the ER/hospital and will be expected to meet the fellow/attending and participate in the evaluation a nd treatment of the patient.

The general structur e encourages students to develop ideas on reflective practice and to become reflective practitioners and learn how to apply the principles of narrative medicine to the physician-patient relatio nship. Narrative medicine is a field of medical humanities that privileges study of narrative as a means of developing and retaining physician empathy, of developing more effective physician-pa tient relationships, and of developing greater analytical and critical thi nking skills. Much of the focus of narrative medicine is on understanding the patient story as a narrative, and teaching the study of narrative structure and the collection of detailed patient stories. In coll ection of a detailed story the physician then learns more about the patient that will be important in negotiating treatment plan s, in increasing cultural competency, in maximizing psycho-social aspect s of healing, and in maximizing physician self- care behaviors.

Clinical service The neurosurgery service at Shands Hospital UF is divided into multiple services consisting of faculty, a senior resident,a junior resident and, on some services, an intern. Medical students will have the opportunity to work with all services over the 4 week rotation. The student will rotate through the services and will come under the direct mentorship of the senior resident for each service. The services are generally divided by su bspecialty area, and allow a student to focus on one subset of neurosurgical di sease, although all services also care for general neurosurgical patients. During the rotation students may be assigned patien ts by the mentoring senior resident (usually 2 patients per week). The student is responsible for presenting these pa tients on morning rounds and is expected to complete all floor duties related to those patients including writing orders/daily notes etc. It is expected that the student is in communication with the resident members of his or her team throughout the day to be sure that all tasks related to the service are completed. 2.

COPD 1. http://www.annals.org/content/143/5/317.full.pdf+html A large multi-center RCT of VA patients with mode rate to severe COPD (mean baseline FEV1 36%) found tiotropium reduced the proportion of patie nts with 1 or more exacerbations during 6 months of treatment vs. placebo (27.9 % vs. 32.3 %). These results support using tiotropium in COPD patients with moderate to severe obstruction and frequent exacerbations. 2. http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa021322 This study found a combination of BMI, FEV1 , modified MRC dyspnea scale, and 6-minute walk (i.e. the BODE index) wa s a better predictor of mortality than FEV1 alone. The BODE index may prove to be a better guide than FEV1 for assessing the efficacy of new treatments and adjusting the aggressiveness of therapy. 3. http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJM200012283432601 The TORCH study randomized over 6,000 patients with baseline FEV1 < 60% predicted to placebo vs. salmeterol alone vs. fl uticasone alone vs. a combination of salmeterol and fluticasone over 3 years. Compared to pl acebo, patients receiving combin ation therapy had a 0.9% annual reduction in mortality (p = .052). Use of salmeterol, fluticasone, or a combination of the 2 reduced the frequency of exacerbations, but p wa s >.10 for all 3 for reducing risk of COPD- related death. All-cause mortalit y and COPD-related death were lo wer with combination therapy than fluticasone alone (p = .007 and .008, respectively). 4. http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJM199906243402502 Multicenter, double blind, placebo- controlled st udy found modest benefit to use of high-dose intravenous steroids. Steroid group had fewer treatment failure s (combined endpoint of death, need for intubation, readmission, or intensification of pharmaco logic therapy), and shorter hospital stays, but the primary benefit was in decr easing the need to intens ify therapy with use of open-label steroids. No benefit fr om steroids was present at 6 m onths of f/u, and 2 week and 8 week courses were equally effective. ASTHMA 1. http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa042552 RCT of 466 patients of 6 months duration found PRN use of a single i nhaler combination of beclomethasone and albuterol resu lted in better peak flows and fe wer exacerbations compared to PRN use of albuterol alone, as well as compar able peak flows, exacerbation rate, lung function, and symptoms to regular twice daily use of beclomethasone. The PRN beclomethasone group on average used < 125 mcg/day compared to 500 mc g/day in the regular twice daily groups. 2. http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa042552 A year-long RCT of 225 adults with mild persistent asthma compared prn inhaled corticosteroids based upon symptom-based action plan vs. dail y treatment with ICS vs. daily leukotriene inhibitor and found no difference in morning peak expiratory flow and the rate of asthma exacerbations despite the prn corticosteroid group using an average of only 0.5 week of steroid per year. The ICS group had superior asthma control scores and lower markers of airway inflammation. Some attribute this relatively mode st benefit of regular ICS use to the lower exacerbation rate in this study compared to its predecessors, which speaks to the challenge of identifying mild persistent asthmatics. 3. http://ajrccm.atsjourna ls.org/cgi/reprint/171/2/129 This study included 2,760 asthmatics with a history of at least one exacerbation in the previous year and regular need for rescue bronchodilators despite baseline use of , on average, moderate doses of inhaled corticosteroi d. Patients randomized to budesoni de/formoterol (80/4.5) bid and prn had prolonged time to exacerbations requi ring medical intervention compared to combination therapy with terbutaline prn or higher dose steroid (bude sonide 320 bid) plus terbutaline prn. Subsequent RCTs have also sh own favorable outcomes with this approach. 4. http://ajrccm.atsjournals .org/cgi/reprint/164/8/S1/S12 Review summarizes several large RCTs studying th e role of anti-IgE anti body in allergic asthma. The use of anti-IgE is associated with decr eased frequency of exacerbations, reductions in corticosteroid dose, and improved quality of life in symptomatic patients with moderate to severe allergic asthma CAP 1. http://jama.ama-assn.or g/cgi/reprin t/302/10/1059 359 patients with lower respiratory tract infe ctions in 6 Swiss academic hospitals were randomized to a treatment algorithm based on pro calcitonin (PCT) levels or to treatment based on current evidence based guidelines. PCT-guide d therapy reduced total antibiotic exposure without any change in advers e outcomes. Controversy exists regarding the unusually high prevalence of \"severe\" pneumonia by PSI score, and that reduction in exposure was primarily due to reduced duration of antibio tics rather than avoidance.

Emergency Medicine - Career Track - Shands at Gainesville EMD R2 | 4th Year Required | Emergency Medicine | Clinical Science Prerequisites The 4th year UF medical student must have inte rest in pursuing residency training in Emergency Medicine. Students need to demonstrate appropriate clinical skills by successfully completing the 3rd year core clerkships (inc luding IM, Surgery, OB/Gyn, Pediatri cs). It is not necessary to complete an EM rotation prior to this course. Course Description Goals and Objectives This rotation is designed fo r the student interested in emergency medicine as a career. As emergency medicine has grown into it's role as a medical specialty it has become clear that there are certain attrib utes and skills needed to assure success and satisfaction in this field. While all physicians need training in the ha ndling of basic medical emergencies, this is generally covered in the standard 4th year emer gency medicine rotation. Students interested in making a career of emergency medicine need exposu re to other aspects of life as an emergency physician. These include the rigors of shift wo rk, the communication skills necessary for transference of care, the skill set needed to ma ke rapid patient dispositions, the importance of concise ED case presentations, the ability to mana ge patients simultaneously and the appropriate use of consultation services. This rotation also provides opportunities to gain advice on how to plan for residency; evaluation of programs, th e application process, interviewing, internship survival, etc. This rotation affords students the o pportunity to: 1) practice recognition of \"sick\" vs \"not-sick\" patients 2) refine skills in stabilization of acute life threatening emergencies 3) enhance skills at developing \"complaint-bas ed\" differential diagnos es 4) experience the continuum of initial evaluation, st abilization, treatment and dispos ition of the acutely ill or injured patient 5) foster understanding of the co mplimentary interactions between the Emergency Department (ED) and the rest of the health care system 6) refine ED case presentation skills 7) develop a mini-mentorship relationship with an academic emergency physi cian Curriculum Shift schedules - Schedules will be modeled after th e EM intern schedules. Expectations include making expedited, efficient and appropriate pres entations, differentiating accurately between sick and not-sick patients, cr eating well rounded differential dia gnosis lists and forming, as well as, supporting a plan of evaluation and treatmen t. Students will be e xpected to prepare and present a formal case presentation during the rotation based on a ED case. Efficiency, conciseness and completeness of the presentati on, charting and handling of the question session will be graded. Active participation in our monthly journal club is expected. Examinations - Students will continue to take the multiple choice \"end-of-rotation\" test as administered to all required clerkship rotators. Instru ctional Labs - Students will part icipate in procedure labs to learn and refine skills in suturing/wound mana gement, airway management, splinting, central venous access, ultrasound, etc. These labs will involve the use of hi-fidelity simulation mannequins. Students have the opportunity to deve lop diagnostic and treatment plan skills in simulated patient encounters. Some of these will al so take place in small group sessions with oral board type cases. Some will take place using hi -fidelity patient simulators. The cases will cover commonly encountered high-risk patient complaints such as chest pain, sh ort of breath, altered level of consciousness, multiple trauma, etc Course Faculty and Staff Beth Magyari (Course Staff) Matthew Ryan MD, PhD (Director) Meeting Place and Time Orientation: First Monday of the rotation.

Students will complete one shift with Duval Co. Fi re Rescue or attend 911 EMS dispatch. Presentations - Expedited and efficient (but complete) case presentations are a core skill of competent emergency physicians. Students will be expected to prepare a formal case presentation by the end of the rotation. This cas e will be accompanied by a formal written ED- chart. The students will be required to present the case at a conference during the third week of the rotation in front of educational staff, resident s and attendings. They wi ll then field questions on the case, as if they were signing the case out to a colleague. Efficiency, conciseness and completeness of the presentation, charting and hand ling of the question session will be graded. Journal Club/Didactic Lectures - Didactic le ctures and SIM sessions will focus on common topics in EM (approach to CP, SO B, AMS, trauma, etc), or topics often not covered elsewhere in the COM curriculum (environmental emergencies, toxicology, etc). Our monthly journal club is open for attendance fo r the students. Articles are chosen to help learners develop skills in critically appraisi ng the literature, and for timely relevance to EM. Articles are presented by residents, but one paper may be evaluated by, and presented by, the sub-I students. Faculty mentors will aid the s ub-I students in evaluating the paper prior to presentation at the formal journal club. This will further provide interaction time between residents and EM-bound students. Examinations - SAEMTESTS.org- The Societ y for Academic Emergency Medicine has developed a web-based set of EM -subject tests. Sub-I students during the rotation will perform these tests. Students will take the NBME EM ACE (she lf exam) the last da y of the rotation. Instructional Labs - Students will participate in proce dure labs to learn and refine skills in suturing/wound management, airway management , splinting, central venous access, ultrasound, etc. These labs will involve the use of hi-fidelity simulation mannequins. Simulated Patient Encounters - Students will get the opportunity to develop diagnostic and treatment plan skills in simulated patient enc ounters. Some of these will take place in small group sessions with oral board type cases. So me will take place usi ng hi-fidelity patient simulators. The cases will cover commonly encount ered high-risk patient complaints such as chest pain, short of breath, altered level of consciousness, multiple trauma, etc Course Faculty and Staff Debra Eurom (Course Staff) Thomas K Morrissey MD, PhD (Director) Kelsey Kyne (Course Staff) Meeting Place and Time Orientation: first Monday of the rotation.
