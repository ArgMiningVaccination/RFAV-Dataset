Introduction General practice is at the forefront of healthcare in Australia and in a pivotal position to deliver preventive healthcare. More than 137 million general practice consultations take place annually in Australia and 85% of the Australian population consult a general practitioner (GP) at least once a year.1 Preventive healthcare is an important activity in general practice. It includes the prevention of illness, the early detection of specific disease, and the promotion and maintenance of health. The partnership between GP and patient can help people reach their goals of maintaining or improving health. Preventive care is also critical in addressing the health disparities faced by disadvantaged and vulnerable population groups. Prevention of illness is the key to Australia's future health - both individually and collectively. About 32% of Australia's total burden of disease can be attributed to modifiable risk factors (Figure I.1 and Table I.1).2 Figure I.1. Leading risk factors contributing to the burden of disease3 *Total burden of disease and injury measured by disability-adjusted life year (DALY) A healthy lifestyle is vital for preventing disease, including prevention of cancer. Cancer Australia4 summarises the recommendations for adults to reduce their risk of cancer and stay healthy as the following: Do not smoke Maintain a healthy weight Be active Eat a balanced and nutritious diet Limit alcohol consumption Be sun smart Protect against infection The evidence of associations between behavioural and biomedical risk factors and chronic diseases is summarised in Table I.1.0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8Low fruit and vegetable consumptionAlcoholHigh blood cholesterolPhysical inactivityOverweight/obesityHigh blood pressureTobacco % DALYS*2 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Table I.1.

The recommendation is to enhance vitamin D levels through adequate sun exposure and/or supplements if required For colorectal cancer (CRC), dietary risks relate to high intakes of processed (preserved) meat. In addition, a high intake of red meat is associated with an increased risk of CRC. The Australian dietary guidelines (ADG) therefore recommend that processed meat intake should be limited (also because of its high saturated fat content). In addition, to enhance dietary variety and reduce some of the health risks associated with consuming red meat, the ADG recommend Australian adults should consume up to a maximum of 455 g per week (one serve [65 g] per day) of lean red meats \u00a7The evidence for tobacco smoking and oral health relate to oral cancer and adult periodontal diseases ||The evidence for excessive alcohol consumption and oral health relate to oral cancer #For oral health, dietary risks relate to amount and frequency of free sugars for dental caries, soft drinks and fruit juices for dental erosion, excess fluoride for enamel developmental defects, and deficiency of vitamin C for periodontal disease **The evidence for obesity and breast cancer is for postmenopausal women Persistent infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV) is a central cause of cervical cancer. HPV infection is not identified in Table I.1 as it only includes those risk factors that are implicated in more than one chronic disease and have the greatest prevalence within the population. It is important to recognise that the behavioural risk factors of multiple sexual partners and early age at initiation of sexual activity reflect the probability of being infected with HPV The chronic diseases included in Table I.1 are those that currently contribute the most to burden of disease and/or are the focus of ongoing national surveillance efforts The behavioural and biomedical risk factors included in Table I.1 are those that are implicated in more than one chronic disease and have the greatest prevalence within the population ADG, Australian dietary guidelines; CKD, chronic HPV, human papillomavirus Reproduced with permission from Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. Chronic disease risk factors. Canberra: AIHW, 20163 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition The Red Book The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) has published the Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice (Red Book) since 1989 to support evidence-based preventive activities in primary care. The Red Book is now widely accepted as the main guide to the provision of preventive care in Australian general practice. Purpose The Red Book is designed to provide the general practice team with guidance on opportunistic and proactive preventive care. It provides a comprehensive and concise set of recommendations for patients in general practice with additional information about tailoring advice depending on risk and need. The Red Book provides the evidence and reasons for the efficient and effective use of healthcare resources in general practice. The Red Book's companion publication, National guide to a preventive health assessment for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, 2nd edn, is intended for all health professionals delivering primary healthcare to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Scope The Red Book covers primary (preventing the initial occurrence of a disorder) and secondary (preventive early detection and intervention) activities. These guidelines focus on preventive activities applicable to substantial portions of the general practice population rather than specific subgroups. This means, in general, recommendations apply to asymptomatic (low-risk) people. However, there is an emphasis on equity, with recommendations aimed at major disadvantaged groups at higher risk of disease and those who are less likely to receive preventive care. These guidelines do not include: detailed information on the management of risk factors or disease (eg what medications to use when treating hypertension) information about the prevention of infectious diseases. This information has been limited largely to immunisation and some sexually transmissible infections (STIs). There is limited advice about travel medicine. This information can be obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel or World Health Organization (WHO) International Travel and Health at www.who.int/ith/en The Australian experience The role of general practice in prevention has been recognised by the Council of Australian Governments (COAG)6 and in the Australian Government's National Preventative Health Strategy and National Primary Health Care Strategic Framework.2,7 Deaths and hospitalisations from preventable illness have continued to decline in Australia. However, the leading causes of death and disability in Australia are preventable or able to be delayed by early treatment and intervention (Figure I.2).84 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Figure I.2.

There were 32,919 potentially avoidable deaths in Australia in 2010; 62% were classified as potentially preventable and 38% as potentially treatable.8 Preventable death rates fell from 142 to 91 deaths per 100,000 between 1997 and 2010 (36%), and treatable death rates fell by 41% (from 97 to 57 deaths per 100,000) Reproduced with permission from Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. Australia's health 2014. Canberra: AIHW, 2014. An Australian review10 concluded that lifestyle interventions could have a large impact on population health. The absolute cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk approach and screening for diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) were also given high priority for action. Despite this evidence and wide acceptance of its importance, preventive interventions in general practice remain underused, being the primary reason for the consultation in only seven of every 100 clinical encounters.11 This is small when it is considered that preventable chronic diseases, along with biomedical risk factors, account for approximately one-fifth of all problems currently managed in Australian general practice.12 Each preventive activity uses up some of the available time that GPs have to spend with their patients. It may also involve direct or indirect costs to the patient. Much more needs to be done to support and improve proper evidence- based preventive strategies, and to minimise practices that are not beneficial or have been proven to be harmful. The RACGP has been championing this cause since its foundation, and encourages all general practices, GPs and their teams to prioritise evidence-based preventive health activities. Benefits and harms of preventive health activities 'Prevention is better than cure' makes intuitive sense. Yet there is evidence that some preventive activities are not effective, some are actually harmful. It has been said 'all screening programs do some harm; some do good as well'.13 Screening of asymptomatic patients may lead to overdiagnosis, causing needless anxiety, appointments, tests, drugs and even operations, and may leave the patient less healthy as a consequence. Therefore, it is crucial that evidence clearly demonstrates that benefits outweigh those harms for each preventive activity. Determining whether a preventive activity is beneficial, harmful or of indeterminate effect (ie there is not enough evidence on which to base a decision) requires a consistent, unbiased, evidence-based approach. Cancer screening, in particular, can polarise different sectors of the health profession and broader community. The objective interpretation of evidence, balancing harms and benefits, and considering overdiagnosis and overtreatment is a goal of the Red Book.5 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition In the Red Book, the RACGP provides information to assist GPs in caring for their patients, including in areas where the evidence is uncertain or contentious. Screening activities are only recommended where evidence demonstrates that benefits outweigh harms. Chapter 15 provides some guidance on common tests where this is not the case or where the evidence is either unclear or not available. Prevention in the practice population The risk of illness and disease is associated with a range of factors that operate on the individual across the lifecycle. For example, poor nutrition and lack of antenatal care during pregnancy are associated with later risk of chronic diseases in the child. Risk behaviours in childhood may become entrenched, leading to progressive physiological changes that can cause chronic diseases in later life. All these factors are in turn influenced by the social determinants of health, which operate at the local community and broader societal levels; these are poverty, housing, education and economic development (Figure I.3). Thus, it is highly desirable for general practice to think beyond the preventive healthcare needs of the individual patient, towards a practice population approach to primary prevention. Figure I.3.

Australia's health 2014. Canberra: AIHW, 2014.6 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition General practice has a practical role to play in addressing these determinants and helping to break the cycle that may exist linking social and economic factors to illness and injury. This requires a systematic approach across the whole practice population, not just for those who seek out or are most receptive to preventive care. This may include auditing medical records to identify those who are missing out, using special strategies to support patients with low literacy, and being proactive in following up patients who are most at risk. It will usually require teamwork within the practice as well as links with other services. General practice also has a broader role in facilitating health improvement for vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in the local community, in association with other services and providers. In some cases, this may involve advocacy for their needs. Information on local vulnerable and disadvantaged groups and their access to healthcare can be obtained from local Primary Health Networks (PHNs) or state and territory health networks. Measures to improve access to preventive healthcare by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are especially important given their higher burden of disease and the barriers that exist to preventive healthcare. More information is available in the National guide to preventive health assessment for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, 2nd edn. Screening versus case finding Many clinicians confuse screening and case-finding tests. Screening is defined as 'the examination of asymptomatic people in order to classify them as likely or unlikely to have a disease'.14 The primary purpose of screening tests is to detect early disease in apparently healthy individuals. Case finding is the examination of an individual or group suspected of having, or at risk of, the condition. Case finding is a targeted approach to identifying conditions in select patients who may already have symptoms.15 A diagnostic test is any kind of medical test performed to establish the presence (or absence) of disease as a basis for treatment decisions in symptomatic or screen-positive individuals (confirmatory test). Examples include taking a mid-stream urine (MSU) sample for evaluation of a urinary tract infection and performing a mammogram for a suspicious breast lump. Screening and case finding carry different ethical obligations. If a clinician initiates screening in asymptomatic individuals, there needs to be conclusive evidence that the procedure can positively affect the natural history of the disorder. Moreover, the risks of screening must be carefully considered as the patient has not asked the health professional for assistance. This situation is somewhat different from case finding, where the patient has presented with a particular problem or has asked for some level of assistance. In this situation, there is no guarantee of benefit of the tests undertaken. It could be argued that there is at least some implied exposure to risk (eg performing colonoscopy to investigate abdominal pain). Opportunistic versus systematic prevention Most preventive activities are undertaken in Australia opportunistically - that is when patients present for other reasons, and the preventive activity is an add-on.16 This approach is supported by evidence, which shows that visits just for 'a general check-up' are not effective or necessary.17 However, systematic approaches to register and recall patients for some specific targeted conditions are worthwhile - including childhood immunisations; and screening for cervical, breast and colorectal cancers (CRC), and diabetes. Proactive recall of patients for screening is warranted for high-risk groups, those who may have difficulty accessing services and for conditions where population coverage has been identified by the government as a public health priority.157 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Screening principles The World Health Organization (WHO) has produced guidelines18,19 for the effectiveness of screening programs. These and the National Health Service's (NHS) guidelines20 in the UK have been kept in mind in the development of recommendations about screening in the Red Book. Condition It should be an important health problem. It should have a recognisable latent or early symptomatic stage. The natural history of the condition, including development from latent to declared disease, should be adequately understood. Test It should be simple, safe, precise and validated. It should be acceptable to the target population. The distribution of test values in the target population should be known and a suitable cut-off level defined and agreed. Treatment There should be an effective treatment for patients identified, with evidence that early treatment leads to better outcomes. There should be an agreed policy on who should be treated and how they should be treated. Outcome There should be evidence of improved mortality, morbidity or quality of life as a result of screening, and the benefits of screening should outweigh the harm. The cost of case finding (including diagnosis and treatment of patients who are diagnosed) should be economically balanced in relation to possible expenditure on medical care as a whole. Consumers Consumers should be informed of the evidence so they can make an informed choice about participation. In Australia, there is an increasing number of Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) items for health assessments in particular population groups: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and adults, refugees, people with an intellectual disability, those aged 45-49 years (with a risk factor), and those aged 75 years. There is evidence that these assessments improve the likelihood of preventive care being received.21 However, it is important that such 'health checks' involve preventive interventions where there is clear evidence of their effectiveness.8 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition II. Patient education and health literacy Impact of patient education Patient education and counselling contribute to behaviour change for the primary prevention of disease.21 More broadly, they may also help to create greater 'health literacy' - the knowledge and skills patients require to maintain their own health, including use of health services. The use of behavioural techniques, especially for self-monitoring, is recommended, as is the use of personal communication and written or other audiovisual materials.22 Patients view the general practitioner (GP) as a key first contact and credible source of preventive advice. Factors that increase the effectiveness of patient education delivered by GPs include: assessing the patient's health literacy23 the patient's sense of trust in their GP24 face-to-face delivery25 patient involvement in decision making26-28 highlighting the benefits and costs29,30 strategies to help the patient remember what they have been told31 tailoring the information to the patient's interest in change32 strategies that address the difficulty in adherence28,33 the use of decision aids.34 Many preventive activities involve a change in health-related behaviour. In general practice, it may take at least six to eight sessions to discuss and see changes to diet, physical activity or weight loss. This will often require referral, which should be followed up by the general practice. As the patient plays a large role in making this happen, it is useful to facilitate more active inclusion of patients in their care. This process is an essential component of self- management support strategies35,36 and has the potential to increase the patient's responsibility for their health. In addition, it: enhances the quality of communication37,38 enhances the doctor-patient consultation26 can reduce the cost of aspects of care through better informed patients27 increases the demand and use of appropriate referral to other health professionals and agencies38 increases adherence to recommended preventive activities and therapeutic regimens.38,39 For those whose first language is not English, a professional interpreter should be considered. Approaches to patient education Patients need to develop their own understanding of the problem and what can be done about it. For simple behavioural changes, such as having a cervical cancer screening test, patients weigh up the perceived benefits and costs.40 These benefits and costs may include answers to the following questions: How big is the problem to the individual? What are the consequences of not doing the test? What are the benefits? What are the barriers? Some health education may require more complex actions over a period of time, such as changing diet, stopping smoking or increasing physical activity. 9 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition There are a number of theoretical approaches to understanding and supporting behaviour change including the: Theory of planned behaviour41 Health belief model42 capability, opportunity and motivation (COM-B) system, which has been proposed by Michie et al as a way of representing the necessary conditions for behaviour change to occur43 'stages of change model',44 which proposes five stages of change, which are viewed as a cyclical, ongoing process during which the person has differing levels of motivation or readiness to change, and the ability to relapse or repeat a stage. Although there is a lack of evidence for greater effectiveness of stage-based approaches,45 this model provides a useful framework for clinicians to identify patients' interest in behaviour change in the consultation and to provide tailored support in a way that is time efficient and likely to be well received.46 Support from the GP and/or practice nurse may involve motivational interviewing. This is an evidence-based counselling technique based on a therapeutic partnership that acknowledges and explores the patient's ambivalence about a behaviour in a way that allows them to clarify what goals are important to them and to organise their reasons in a way that supports actions. Motivational interviewing is a counselling philosophy that values patient autonomy and mutual respect, and the use of open-ended questions, affirmations, reflection and summarising.47 Further information about motivational interviewing and its application in general practice can be found in The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners' (RACGP) Smoking, nutrition, alcohol and physical activity (SNAP): A population health guide to behavioural risk factors in general practice (www.racgp.org.au/your-practice/guidelines/ snap ) and Putting prevention into practice: Guidelines for the implementation of prevention in the general practice setting (Green Book; www.racgp.org.au/your-practice/guidelines/greenbook ). Health inequity It is well recognised that socioeconomic disadvantage has a profound impact on people's health, and GPs are often in a good position to confront this.48 However, poverty is not evenly spread across Australia, and it is likely that GPs who see some patients with socioeconomic disadvantage will see many. Similarly, GPs are not evenly spread with respect to poverty. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) have shown that, in 2006, 11% of GPs worked in the most disadvantaged areas, while 24% worked in the least disadvantaged.49 Healthcare in communities that are socioeconomically deprived is often complex. As well as having more chronic health conditions, and more health behaviours leading to increased risk, there may be a lack of local support and infrastructure to improve the situation. General practices are often one of the few resources patients have to call on. There are often significant personal and social barriers to achieving change. As well as good communication skills, GPs may need to help patients navigate health, housing, welfare and legal systems. This often makes for more- frequent, longer, more-complex consultations. However, the long-term relationships GPs develop with patients are significant enablers for patients who are socioeconomically deprived to be able to make changes. Health equity issues are more complex than just socioeconomic factors. There are specific issues for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, where an ongoing history of colonisation, dispossession and racism interact with a lack of economic opportunity. The National guide to a preventive health assessment for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people , 2nd edn50 provides extensive detail on specific preventive care issues facing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and the health equity material canvassed here should be read in conjunction with those guidelines. They provide much more in-depth and important guidance on preventive healthcare strategies that are recommended for practitioners working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and communities. In addition, GPs should optimise their use of Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) Item 715 that supports health checks in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and their use of Close the Gap provisions in ensuring affordable access to medicines. GPs should also proactively address cost barriers to referral to other services faced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.10 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Supporting patient education and health literacy in disadvantaged groups What are the key equity issues and who is at risk? The complex needs and health problems of disadvantaged groups, and the interactions between social, psychological, environmental and physical determinants of health mean that special effort is required for patient education to be effective. Socioeconomic disadvantage and low health literacy are linked. Health literacy is a key factor in how patient education leads to patient empowerment. It allows individuals to access, understand and use information to negotiate the health system and support self-management.51 Health literacy is important as low health literacy is associated with poorer health outcomes and lower utilisation of health services such as screening and preventive care. Other groups that require particular focus in patient education include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) groups.52 What can GPs do? A range of strategies can be used by GPs to help patients with low health literacy and to promote health-related behaviour changes.51,53 These include: specific communication techniques such as asking patients to 'teach back' what has been taught to them and the 'ask me 3' health education program based on three patient-led (https://npsf.site-ym.com/ default.asp?page=askme3 ) motivational interviewing and counselling techniques plain-language and culturally appropriate written materials (explicitly asking about reading skills may be important) use of web-based or computer-based programs (explicitly asking about internet access, eg at home or through a library may be important) helping patients navigate the healthcare system to improve access to care, for example, by working in collaboration with other services such as community health centres and consumer organisations to access community health and group education programs. Effective patient education for CALD populations means ensuring that health services and messages are accessible and relevant. GPs should: offer interpreter services during consultations. There is good evidence that interpreter services improve care experience and clinical outcomes55 use patient education materials in plain English or those that are culturally and linguistically sensitive (eg have a range of patient material in relevant different languages in your practice) link individuals to specific community-based health programs.56,57 Cultural competence is important in providing appropriate patient education to all communities. This is particularly important in working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.58 It is important for GPs to better appreciate Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' perspectives on health, culture and history, and provide services within a culturally appropriate framework.59 This could be facilitated through: reading about the history and impact of colonisation on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and their health, nationally and locally60 arranging Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural awareness training for themselves and practice staff (www.racgp.org.au/yourracgp/faculties/aboriginal/education/resources-for-gps-and-practice-staff/cultural- awareness ) linking your practice and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients to local Aboriginal community controlled health services61 developing relationships with your local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community, and resources, people and services that can provide you with assistance and cultural mentorship.11 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition III. Development of the Red Book The Red Book, 9th edn, has been developed by a team of general practitioners (GPs) and experts to ensure that the content is the most valuable and useful for GPs and their teams. The content broadly conforms to the highest evidence-based standards according to the principles underlying the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) tool.62,63 The dimensions addressed are: scope and purpose clarity of presentation rigour of development stakeholder involvement applicability editorial independence. The Red Book maintains developmental rigour, editorial independence, and relevance and applicability to general practice. Recommendations The recommendations in the Red Book are based on current, evidence-based guidelines for preventive activities. Focus has been on those most relevant to Australian general practice. Usually, this means that the recommendations are based on Australian guidelines such as those endorsed by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). Where NHMRC guidelines are not available or recent, other sources have been used, such as guidelines from the National Heart Foundation of Australia, Canadian or US preventive guidelines, or the results of systematic reviews. References to support these recommendations are listed. However, particular references may relate only to part of the recommendation (eg only relating to one of the high-risk groups listed), and other references in the section may have been considered in formulating the overall recommendation. These recommendations are based on the best available information at the time of writing (May 2015 to May 2016). Any updated information will be posted on The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners' (RACGP) website. More information and guidelines can be found on the NHMRC website www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines-publications , the Australian Government clinical guidelines portal www.clinicalguidelines.gov.au ) and the Cochrane Collaboration website ( www.cochrane.org ).12 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition I V. How to use the Red Book The Red Book is designed to be used in a number of ways, all of which can be useful in day-to-day general practice. The Red Book can be used as a: guide to establish who is most at risk and for whom screening or preventive care is most appropriate refresher to check the latest recommendations reminder to check at a glance what preventive activities are to be performed in various age groups and how often checklist of preventive activities used according to an individual patient's health profile patient education tool, to demonstrate to patients the evidence that exists for preventive activities study guide - a comprehensive list of references is provided in each chapter. This allows more in-depth information on a particular topic. Organisational detail The information in the Red Book is organised into three levels. The first level is the lifecycle chart, which highlights when preventive activities should be performed and the optimum frequency for each activity. The lifecycle chart is organised by age and clinical topic. Simply check the column under a particular age group to see what activities should be considered for the patient. The preventive activities that are recommended for everyone within a particular age range, and for which there is sound research evidence, are shaded in red. Activities to be performed only in patients with risk factors or where the evidence is not as strong are shaded in light red or pink. A copy of this chart can be downloaded and attached to the patient record as a systematic reminder for preventive activities. General practitioners (GPs) can also use it as a wall chart or keep it handy on the desk. The second level is more detailed and presents a summary of recommendations in addition to tables that identify what preventive care should be provided for particular groups in the population. This edition of the Red Book adopts the existing National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) levels of evidence and grades of recommendations.64 Future editions will consider adopting the GRADE system ( www.gradeworkinggroup.org ) for evaluating the quality of evidence for outcomes reported in systematic reviews. Recommendations in the tables are graded according to the levels of evidence and strength of recommendation. The levels of evidence are coded by the roman numerals I-IV while the strength of recommendation is coded by the letters A-D. Practice Points are employed where no good evidence is available. Refer to Table IV.1 for more information.13 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Table IV.1. Coding scheme used for levels of evidence and grades of recommendation64 Levels of evidence Level Explanation I Evidence obtained from a systematic review of level II studies II Evidence obtained from a randomised controlled trial (RCT) III-1 Evidence obtained from a pseudo-randomised controlled trial (ie alternate allocation or some other method) III-2Evidence obtained from a comparative study with concurrent controls: non-randomised, experimental trial cohort study case-control study interrupted time series with a control group III-3Evidence obtained from a comparative study without concurrent controls: historical control study two or more single arm study interrupted time series without a parallel control group IV Case series with either post-test or pre-test/post-test outcomes Practice PointOpinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, descriptive studies or reports of expert committees Grades of recommendations Grade Explanation A Body of evidence can be trusted to guide practice B Body of evidence can be trusted to guide practice in most situations C Body of evidence provides some support for recommendation(s) but care should be taken in its application D Body of evidence is weak and recommendation must be applied with caution Only key references used to formulate the recommendations are included in the tables. Where the evidence is available on the internet, the web link is given to enable easy access to original materials. There is also information on how the preventive care should be implemented, for example, a brief outline of the method of screening Finally, there is a third level of information, which is on particular disadvantaged population groups that may be at risk of not receiving preventive care and what should be done to increase their chance of preventive care.14 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition References - Chapters I-IV 1.

What's new in the 9th edition? Chapter Change 1. Preventive activities prior to pregnancyAdvice on nutrition, weight assessment and oral health has been included in Table 1.1 Information on health inequity is presented under 'What are the key equity issues and who is at risk?' and 'What can GPs do?', highlighting the key issues and strategies 2. Genetic counselling and testing Information on referral to clinical genetic services has been added Inclusion of the use of a simple family history screening questionnaire to identify individuals in general practice who may require a more detailed assessment of their family history of cancer, heart disease or diabetes (Appendix 2A. Family history screening questionnaire) Additional advice added regarding Down syndrome - for all pregnant women - hereditary haemochromatosis, haemoglobinopathies and thalassaemias (Table 2.1) Non-invasive prenatal test now included 3.

Additional advice and information on effective interventions Section 7.5. Physical activity includes assessment advice and referral information for different age groups, and those at increased risk Consumption of red meat and processed meat recommendations modified to align with World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations Information on health inequity is presented under 'What are the key equity issues and who is at risk?' and 'What can GPs do?', highlighting the key issues and strategies17 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition 8. Prevention of vascular and metabolic diseaseInformation added on assessing need for anticoagulation (Table 8.5.2) New information on atrial fibrillation New advice about screening for diabetes based on US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines Information on health inequity is presented under 'What are the key equity issues and who is at risk?' and 'What can GPs do?', highlighting the key issues and strategies 9. Early detection of cancer Sections rearranged in order of incidence - that is, most commonly reported in Australia ( www.aihw.gov.au/cancer/cancer-in-australia-overview-2012/ch2/#t3 ) After reviewing information from recent large trials of prostate cancer screening, population screening for prostate cancer by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing continues to not be recommended. Therefore, GPs have no obligation to offer prostate cancer screening to asymptomatic men. Reference included to a decision aid to assist discussion of possible benefits and harms of screening with PSA in men who have individual concerns about prostate cancer Inclusion of information on the cervical cancer screening program to commence in May 2017 New information about the risks and benefits of screening mammogram; in particular, the risk of over-diagnosis Oral cancer section moved to Chapter 11. Oral health Information on health inequity is presented under 'What are the key equity issues and who is at risk?' and 'What can GPs do?' highlighting the key issues and strategies 10. Psychosocial Additional information on adolescents and those at average risk included for intimate partner violence (Table 10.3.1) Information on health inequity is presented under 'What are the key equity issues and who is at risk?' and 'What can GPs do?', highlighting the key issues and strategies 11. Oral health Title of chapter has changed from 'Oral hygiene' to 'Oral health' to include information on both oral hygiene and cancer 14. Osteoporosis Inclusion of an additional section on quantitative ultrasound as an alternative imaging technique for assessing fracture risk 15. Screening tests of unproven benefitAdditional screening tests not recommended: Coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography for coronary artery disease Cardiac calcium scoring for coronary heart disease Thermography and single nucleotide polymorphisms testing for breast cancer Optical colonoscopy and CT colonography for colorectal cancer Heel ultrasound for osteoporosis Carotid artery ultrasound for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis Enquiry about sleep for obstructive sleep apnoea Bimanual pelvic exam during a routine Pap smear in women Genetic testing for methylenetetrahydrofolate has been renamed 'genomic sequencing'18 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition 1. Preventive activities prior to pregnancy of reproductive age should be considered for preconception care (C). This consists of interventions that aim to identify and modify biomedical, behavioural and social risks to a woman's health or pregnancy outcome through prevention and management.1 Preconception care should include reproductive planning and the effective use of contraception to prevent unplanned pregnancy (A), smoking cessation (A)2 and advice to consider abstinence from alcohol (especially if planning a pregnancy, or if the woman could become pregnant or is in the early stages of pregnancy),3 folic acid and iodine supplementation (A),4,5 nutrition and weight review of immunisation status (C),7 medications (B),8 oral health,9 and chronic medical conditions, especially glucose control in patients with diabetes (B).10 There is evidence to demonstrate improved birth outcomes with preconception healthcare in women with diabetes, phenylketonuria and nutritional deficiency,11 as well as benefit from the use of folate supplementation12 and a reduction in maternal anxiety.13 Below is information about all the potential interventions in preconception care that expert groups have recommended (C). What does preconception care include? Medical issues Reproductive life plan Assist your patients to develop a reproductive life plan that includes whether they want to have children. If they do, discuss the number, spacing and timing of intended children, and provide effective contraception to enable the implementation of this plan and reduce the risk of an unplanned pregnancy. If relevant, discuss reduction in fertility with advancing maternal age. Reproductive history Ask if there have been any problems with previous pregnancies such as infant death, fetal loss, birth defects (particularly neural tube defects [NTD]), low birth weight, preterm birth, or gestational diabetes. Also, if there are any ongoing risks that could lead to a recurrence in a future pregnancy. Medical history Ask if there are any medical conditions that may affect future pregnancies. Are chronic conditions such as diabetes, thyroid disease, hypertension, epilepsy and thrombophilia well managed? Consider if current management is optimal for early pregnancy given that early embryogenesis will occur prior to any consultation in pregnancy. Medication use Review all current medications for teratogenic effects, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins and supplements.19 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Genetic/family history (also refer to Chapter 2. Genetic counselling and testing) Increased frequency of intellectual disability, multiple pregnancy losses, stillbirth or early death, and children with congenital abnormalities may suggest the presence of genetically determined disease. Patients of particular ethnic backgrounds may be at increased risk and can benefit from genetic testing for specific conditions. Possible consanguinity (eg cousins married to each other) should be explored, for example, by asking, 'Is there any chance that a relative of yours might be related to someone in your partner's family?' General practitioners (GPs) should consider referral to, or consultation with, a genetic service for testing because test results, which rely on sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value, are not straightforward. Testing often involves complex ethical, social and legal issues. The time on waiting lists for genetic services is usually longer than one month, so direct consultation and liaison by telephone are necessary when the genetic advice could affect a current pregnancy. Provide opportunity for carrier screening for genetic conditions (eg cystic fibrosis, haemoglobinopathies) and referral for genetic counselling based upon risk factors. General physical assessment Conduct a breast examination and, if it is due, perform a cervical screening test (eg Papanicolaou [Pap] test) before pregnancy. Also assess body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure (BP), and check the oral cavity. Substance use Ask about tobacco, alcohol and illegal drug use. Offer counselling and referral for specialised assistance when use is identified. Vaccinations The need for vaccination, particularly for hepatitis B, rubella and varicella, should be assessed as part of any pre conception health check. Vaccinations can prevent some infections that may be contracted during pregnancy, and relevant serological testing can be undertaken to ascertain immunity to hepatitis B and rubella. Routine serological testing for varicella does not provide a reliable measure of vaccine-induced immunity; however, it can indicate whether natural immunity has occurred due to prior infection. Women receiving live viral vaccines such as measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) and varicella should be advised against becoming pregnant within 28 days of vaccination. It is also important that women of childbearing age who present for immunisation should be questioned regarding the possibility of pregnancy as part of the routine pre-vaccination screening, to avoid inadvertent administration of a vaccine(s) not recommended in pregnancy (refer to Section 2.1.4 Prevaccination screening in the those without a clear history of chickenpox or who are non-immune on testing) influenza (recommended during pregnancy) diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (dTpa; to protect newborn from pertussis). Lifestyle issues Family planning Based on the patient's reproductive life plan (refer to above), discuss fertility awareness and how fertility reduces with age, chance of conception, the risk of infertility, and fetal abnormality. For patients not planning to become pregnant, discuss effective contraception and emergency contraceptive options. Folic acid supplementation Women should take a 0.4-0.5 mg per day supplement of folic acid for at least one month prior to pregnancy, and for the first three months after conception. Where there is a known increased risk of NTD (ie patients taking anticonvulsant medication, or with pre-pregnancy diabetes mellitus, previous child or family history of NTD, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate deficiency or BMI >30 kg/m2) or a risk of malabsorption, a 5 mg daily dose is recommended.1420 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Iodine supplementation Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or considering pregnancy should take an iodine supplement of 150 g each day.5 Healthy weight, nutrition and exercise Discuss weight management and caution against being overweight or underweight. Recommend regular, moderate-intensity exercise and assess risk of nutritional deficiencies (eg vegan diet, lactose intolerance, and calcium, iron or vitamin D deficiency due to lack of sun exposure). Psychosocial health Discuss perinatal mental health, including anxiety and depression, preexisting mental health conditions, psychological or psychiatric assessment and treatment, use of medication, and the risk of exacerbation of mood disorders in pregnancy and postpartum. Mental health screening should include a psychosocial assessment. Smoking, alcohol and illegal drug cessation (as indicated) Smoking,15 illegal drug16 and excessive alcohol use17 during pregnancy can have serious consequences for an unborn child and should be stopped prior to conception. Healthy environments Repeated exposure to hazardous toxins in the household and workplace environment can affect fertility and increase the risk of miscarriage and birth defects. Discuss the avoidance of TORCH infections: Toxoplasmosis, Other soil, raw/undercooked meat and unpasteurised milk products; wash all fruit and vegetables. Cytomegalovirus, parvovirus B19 (fifth disease): Discuss the importance of frequent hand-washing. Those who work with children or in the healthcare sector can further reduce risk by using gloves when changing nappies. Listeriosis: Avoid pat\u00e9, soft cheeses (eg feta, brie, blue vein), prepackaged salads, deli meats and chilled/ smoked seafood. Wash all fruit and vegetables before eating. Refer to Food Standards Australia New Zealand (www.foodstandards.gov.au/consumer/generalissues/pregnancy/Pages/default.aspx ) regarding folate, listeria and mercury. Fish: Limit fish containing high levels of mercury. Refer to www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/ mercury-in-fish21 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Table 1.1. Preconception: Preventive interventions Intervention Technique References Folate supplementationMost women: 0.5 mg/day supplementation, beginning ideally at least one month prior to conception and continuing for the first trimester High-risk women: 5 mg/day supplementation, ideally beginning at least one month prior to conception and continuing for the first trimester4, 18-20 Iodine supplementationAll women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or considering pregnancy should take an iodine supplement of 150 g each day5, 14 Nutrition and weight assessmentAll women, especially those who become pregnant in adolescence or have closely- spaced pregnancies (interpregnancy interval less than six months), require nutritional assessment and appropriate intervention in the preconception period with an emphasis on optimising maternal body mass index (BMI) and micronutrient reserves6, 21 Check oral cavity and referralAsk the woman if she has bleeding gums, swellings, sensitive teeth, loose teeth, holes in teeth, broken teeth, toothache, or any other problems in the mouth Check oral cavity to confirm. Reassure the patient that it is safe to have a range of dental treatments during pregnancy Smoking cessationInform women who smoke that tobacco affects fetal growth and advise them to stop smoking. Evidence exists to suggest improved cognitive ability in children of mothers who quit smoking during gestation (III, A). Consider pharmacotherapy when a pregnant woman is otherwise unable to quit, and when the likelihood and benefits of cessation outweigh the risks of pharmacotherapy and potential continued smoking22 Alcohol and illicit drug useFor women who are pregnant or planning a pregnancy, not drinking is the safest option. The risk of harm to the fetus is highest when there is high, frequent maternal alcohol intake. The risk of harm to the fetus is likely to be low if a woman has consumed only small amounts of alcohol before she knew she was pregnant. Inform pregnant women that illicit drugs may harm the fetus and advise them to avoid use1 Interpregnancy intervalPerinatal outcomes are worse with interpregnancy intervals <18 months or >59 months; the outcomes affected are preterm birth, low birth weight and small size for gestational age23 Chronic diseases Optimise control of existing chronic diseases (eg diabetes, hypertension, epilepsy). Avoid teratogenic medications18 BMI, body mass index22 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Health inequity What are the key equity issues and who is at risk? Preconception care is especially important to adolescents and young women in vulnerable populations.24 Adolescent parenthood is more common in low socioeconomic groups and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, and is associated with poor birth outcomes and adverse health effects, including mental health issues and substance misuse.25-29 Decreased folate supplementation is associated with being a woman from a lower socioeconomic group, being an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander person, or being younger or from a rural area.30 Awareness of folic acid is related to income, educational level and younger age.31,32 Other dietary supplements may follow similar gradients. Smoking and alcohol use in pregnancy show socioeconomic gradients. Women who are young, on a low income and of low socioeconomic status, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, single mothers, and women experiencing addiction, violence and mental health issues are all more likely to smoke during pregnancy.33,34 Women from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds are more likely to experience poorer perinatal outcomes.36-38 What can GPs do? Provide youth-friendly care to adolescent parents through non-judgemental, competent, considerate and respectful advice and services.39 Offer women culturally appropriate resources, including in the mother's own language, about health issues and the health system, and consider the use of interpreters. Link women into English language and perinatal education courses, and offer cultural brokerage through maternity liaison officers or bilingual health workers wherever possible.39 Refer to 'Antenatal care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women' in the Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council's Clinical practice guidelines : Antenatal care - Module 1 .39 Refer to the general principles of providing patient education and supporting health literacy in disadvantaged groups.

Genetic counselling and can be used for various purposes, from preconception planning (refer to Chapter 1. Preventive activities prior to pregnancy), during pregnancy, for neonates (newborn screening), during childhood and right through to adult-onset familial diseases (eg cancer, cardiac and neurodegenerative diseases). In order to identify patients who may be at risk of a genetic disorder, a comprehensive family history must be taken from all patients, and this should be regularly updated. A family history should include first-degree and second- degree relatives on both sides of the family and ethnic background. Age of onset of disease and age of death should be recorded where available. Increased frequency and early onset of cancers in families, premature ischaemic heart disease or sudden cardiac death, intellectual disability, multiple pregnancy losses, stillbirth or early death, and children with congenital abnormalities may suggest the presence of genetically determined disease. Patients of particular ethnic backgrounds may be at increased risk and may benefit from genetic testing for specific conditions. Possible consanguinity (eg cousins married to each other) should be explored, for example, by asking, 'Is there any chance that a relative of yours might be related to someone in your partner's family?' General Practitioners (GPs) should consider referral to, or consultation with, a genetic service (general or cancer genetics) for testing because test results, which rely on sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value, are not straightforward. Testing often involves complex ethical, social and legal issues. The time on waiting lists for genetic services is usually longer than one month, so direct consultation and liaison by telephone are necessary when the genetic advice could affect a current pregnancy. On the basis of current evidence, whole genome sequencing is not recommended in low-risk general practice populations (refer to Chapter 15. Screening tests of unproven benefit). Clinical genetic services provide testing, diagnosis, management and counselling for a wide range of genetic conditions. Reasons for referral include: diagnosis of a genetic condition family history of a genetic condition recurrence risk counselling (eg risk of recurrence in a future pregnancy) pregnancy counselling (eg preconception, consanguinity) prenatal screening and testing presymptomatic and predictive testing for adult-onset disorders (eg cancer) discussions surrounding genetic testing arranging of genetic testing. Services such as paternity testing or genetic testing/management of very common genetic conditions (eg haemochromatosis) are not provided by clinical genetic services. Use of a simple family history screening questionnaire (FHSQ) can help identify individuals who may require a more detailed assessment of their family history of cancer, heart disease or diabetes (refer to Appendix 2A. Family history screening questionnaire for a published and validated FHSQ).1 This tool can be used as part of the patient assessment at their first visit to a practice. If a patient is uncertain about their family history, they can be asked to discuss the FHSQ with their relatives prior to completing the questionnaire. For patients with low literacy, the FHSQ may need to be completed with the support of a healthcare professional. A positive response to any question requires follow-up with a more detailed assessment of the family history. As family history can change, it is recommended that the FHSQ be repeated at least three every years.25 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Table 2.1.

Family history screening questionnaire The use of a simple family history screening questionnaire (FHSQ) can help identify individuals who may require a more detailed assessment of their family history of cancer, heart disease or diabetes.1 This tool can be used as part of the patient's assessment at their first visit to a practice. If patients are uncertain about their family history, they can be asked to discuss the FHSQ with their relatives prior to completing the questionnaire. For patients with low literacy, the FHSQ may need to be completed with the support of a healthcare professional. A positive response to any question requires follow-up with a more detailed assessment of the family history. As family history can change it is recommended that the FHSQ be repeated at least every three years. This risk assessment focuses on your close relatives including parents, children, brothers and sisters who are either living or dead. Yes No Have any of your close relatives had heart disease before 60 years of age? 'Heart disease' includes cardiovascular disease, heart attack, angina and bypass surgery. Have any of your close relatives had diabetes? 'Diabetes' is also known as type 2 diabetes or non-insulin dependent diabetes. Do you have any close relatives who had melanoma? Have any of your close relatives had bowel cancer before 55 years of age? Do you have more than one relative on the same side of the family who had bowel cancer at any age? Please think about your parents, children, brothers, sisters, grandparents, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and grandchildren.* Have any of your close male relatives had prostate cancer before 60 years of age? Have any of your close female relatives had ovarian cancer? Have any of your close relatives had breast cancer before 50 years of age? Do you have more than one relative on the same side of your family who has had breast cancer at any age? Please think about your parents, children, brothers, sisters, grandparents, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and grandchildren.* *Only first-degree and second-degree relatives need be considered in this screening questionnaire Reproduced with permission from Emery JD, Reid G, Prevost AT, Ravine D, Walter FM.

Preventive activities in children and young people intervention Prevention and health promotion in the early years, from conception to 5 years of age, is important for an individual's lifelong health and wellbeing.1 It may also be an opportunity to redress health inequalities.2,3 In adolescence, neurodevelopmental studies support the value of early intervention to prevent ongoing harm.4 Many infants and children visit their general practitioner (GP) frequently, and adolescents visit at least once a year.5 This frequent contact provides opportunities for disease prevention and health promotion. Evidence provides moderate support for the hypothesis that 'accessible, family-centred, continuous, comprehensive, coordinated, compassionate and culturally effective care improves health outcomes for children with special healthcare needs'.6 There is also evidence that supports the beneficial impact of similar care for children without special healthcare needs.7,8 Health inequity What are the key equity issues and who is at risk? Low socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with increased childhood morbidity and mortality.9 This includes higher rates of death from neonatal hypoxia, sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI), prematurity-related disorders, and accidental and non-accidental injury;10,11 hospitalisations related to asthma;12 and risk of child abuse.13 Low SES is also associated with overweight and obesity in children.14 While there has been a decline in infant mortality since the 1990s, infant mortality in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples is more than twice that of non-Indigenous children,10 in part due to pregnancy, labour and delivery complications, and trauma and congenital malformations.15 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander infants have higher rates of death from SUDI.16 They are also more likely to be born premature or with low birth weight17,18 and are more likely to be hospitalised before 1 year of age.19 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and people from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to experience low immunisation rates.20 What can GPs do? Refer to the general strategies for supporting patient education and health literacy in disadvantaged groups. Consider advocating for and supporting community-based strategies or policies for health promoting changes within the environments in which families live (eg school-based programs targeting nutrition and physical activity).21-27 Use resources supporting the provision of culturally competent care to adolescents from culturally diverse backgrounds.2833 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Table 3.1.

Intimate partner violence c The Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy's (ASCIA) 2016 Guidelines for allergy prevention in infants supports the introduction of complementary 'solid' foods within four to six months of age and preferably while breastfeeding.51 The introduction of allergenic food should not be delayed. However, the ASCIA position is in conflict with the 2012 National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) guideline, which recommends exclusive breastfeeding until 6 months of age35 The new ASCIA guidelines provide: good evidence* that introducing peanut into the diet of infants who already have severe eczema and/or egg allergy before 12 months of age can reduce the risk of these infants developing peanut allergy moderate evidence that introducing cooked egg into an infant's diet before 8 months of age, where there is a family history of allergy, can reduce the risk of developing egg allergy. Raw egg is not recommended Also refer to Table 7.3.2 *High/good/strong evidence means convincing evidence from well-conducted studies, or many well- conducted studies results pooled into a large analysis (meta-analysis) Moderate evidence means evidence from reasonably well-conducted studies or well-conducted single studies d Developmental progress Early intervention presupposes early detection. Prior to 3 years of age, the rate of attaining developmental milestones varies so much that the simple application of screening 'tools' would excessively detect developmental delay (false positive). This risk is reduced after 3 years of age In the earliest years, guides to developmental progress can be used to initiate an ongoing conversation with parents to elicit their concerns about their child's progress52,53 Developmental milestone assessments are outlined in the Child Personal Health Record, which is provided at birth in New South Wales A tool, such as the Parents' evaluation of developmental status (PEDS), can be used on a regular basis to identify any concerns about their child's development. The information gathered helps the GP gain a better understanding of the progress of each child. Further information on the PEDS questionnaire can be accessed at www.rch.org.au/ccch/peds The value of the PEDS may be increased if used in conjunction with: Learn the signs - Act early at www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/actearly/index.htm l Red flags early intervention guide at www.health.qld.gov.au/cq/child-development/docs/red-flag-a3- poster-banana.pdf (refer to Appendix 3A.

Be aware that small errors in measuring either height/length or weight cause large errors in the position of the calculated BMI on the BMI percentile chart. This is because percentile lines are crowded together in the preschool ages h An Australian randomised controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated that a coordinated cross-agency system of parenting support, which included general practice, produced meaningful effects at the population level56 i For pre-school children, family support and parenting programs continue to be the most effective method of preventing the onset of emotional and behavioural problems, which predispose to mental illness in later childhood and adolescence32,56 j The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concludes with moderate certainty that vision screening for all children at least once between 3 and 5 years of age to detect the presence of amblyopia or its risk factors has a moderate net benefit.57 The USPSTF concludes that the benefits of vision screening for children aged <3 years are uncertain, and that the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined for this age group k The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen children aged 6 years for obesity and offer them or refer them to comprehensive, intensive behavioural interventions to promote improvement in weight status (B)45 There is a moderate net benefit for screening children aged 6-18 years As a screening tool, BMI is an 'acceptable measure for identifying children and adolescents with excess weight'45 'Overweight' is having a BMI between the 85th and 94th percentiles for the individual's and gender 'Obesity' is having a BMI >95th percentile for age and gender l Mental, emotional, behavioural disorder in Australian young people Fifty per cent of adult disorders have onset by 14 years of age Between 14% and 18% of children and young people experience mental health problems of clinical significance Depression and coping with stress are priorities for: -16% of those aged 11-14 years -21% of those aged 15-19 years58 The USPSTF recommends the screening of adolescents (aged 12-18 years) for major depressive disorder when systems are in place to ensure accurate diagnosis, psychotherapy (cognitive, behavioural or interpersonal) and follow-up (B)59 Risk factors for major depressive disorder include parental depression, having comorbid mental health or chronic medical conditions, and having experienced a major negative life event5938 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Practice Point Comment m Assess for risky behaviours Promoting health and minimising harm is a whole-of-community opportunity and responsibility. Celebrating strengths, explaining confidentiality (including its limits) and using the HE2ADS3 framework60 (refer to below) to explore with young people the context in which they live are strategies that are likely to improve the clinician's capacity to promote health and minimise morbidity (C):61,62 -Eating and exercise -Activities -Drugs -Sexuality -Suicide -Safety Young people who present frequently are at higher risk of having a mental health problem63 Provide messages that encourage delay in initiation of potentially risky behaviours and, at the same time, promote risk-reduction strategies if adolescents choose to engage or are already engaging in the behaviour Use principles of motivational interviewing in the assessment and discussion of risky health behaviours with adolescent patients (including safe practice for those who are sexually active) Be familiar with the resources in the community that provide harm reduction programs for substance abuse, pregnancy prevention, injury prevention and road safety Be familiar with resources in the community that provide parenting skills training for parents of young people Advocate for the introduction, further development and evaluation of evidence-based prevention and treatment programs that use a harm reduction philosophy in schools and communities (C) ASCIA, Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy; BMI, body NHMRC, National Health trial; USPSTF, US Preventive Services Task Force References 1.

It will allow you to refer early before the child begins to struggle to achieve tasks usually managed by children of the same age. Step 1: Find the child's age across the top of the table below. Step 2: Read through the list and identify if the child is demonstrating any of the Red Flags at their age level. Step 3: If the child is between age levels (e.g. 2 yrs 5 months) check the lower age level for Red Flags (ie. 2 yrs)When to be concerned? One or more Red Flags (in any area) is a sign of delayed development. Who to go to? Parents: If you have concerns about your child's development, please contact your Family Doctor or Child Health Nurse Phone: (07) 4992 7000 Health Professionals: If you have screened and identified any Red Flags, please contact your local Child Development Service.Who helps with these Red Flags?

Preventive activities in middle age activities for low-risk patients in the 45-64 years age group are listed in Table 4.1. Patients should be offered these opportunistically, or at two-year to five-year intervals. Planned health checks in general practice of middle-aged adults have been demonstrated to improve the frequency of the management of smoking, nutrition, alcohol and physical activity (SNAP) behavioural risk factors; screening for cervical and colorectal cancer (CRC); and hyperlipidaemia.1-3 There is also evidence that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health checks improve early detection of diabetes and provision of preventive care.4 However, there is mixed evidence for the effectiveness of interventions to address multiple risk factors.5 These checks may be facilitated by the involvement of practice nurses.6-8 Interventions should be tailored to the level of risk, and the use of the 5As framework ( Ask, Assess, Advise and agree, Assist, Arrange follow-up) is recommended as a guide to their delivery in primary healthcare.9 Health inequity What are the key equity issues and who is at risk? Midlife, between 45 and 64 years of age, is particularly a time of determining patient risk factors and offering screening for health conditions. Multimorbidity, particularly physical-mental health comorbidity, is an important issue in middle aged populations. Social disadvantage can hasten the onset of multimorbidity by about 10-15 years, suggesting screening should start earlier in high-risk populations, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples (eg at 30 years of age). This may be a critical time for preventive interventions to reduce later life chronic illness.10 The impact of income-related inequalities on the prevalence of common mental health disorders and psychological distress is particularly seen in middle aged people.11 What can GPs do? Refer to the general principles of providing patient education and supporting health literacy in disadvantaged groups. Be aware that disadvantaged groups may be less likely to access health checks,12 so proactive efforts to go outside the practice (eg to workplaces) may be needed or preventive care may be built in opportunistically to routine consultations. Actively manage vulnerable patients by recalling patients by phone or text messages for preventive care. 43 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Table 4.1.

Preventive activities in older age Older people are at increased risk of multiple chronic conditions that may impair their function and quality of life. Those living alone, with difficulties accessing healthcare, with poor mobility and with limited financial support are particularly vulnerable.1 Their health problems may be exacerbated by poor nutrition, poor oral health,2 lack of physical activity,3 taking multiple medications4,5 and lack of sun exposure,6 all of which can be addressed in preventive activities. Older people may rely on the help and support of carers and family. Carers, particularly carers for people with dementia or depression, are at risk of depression, anxiety, emotional distress, loneliness and isolation, but their healthcare needs are often overlooked.7-11 Their need for support should be assessed when possible (C) and appropriate referral instituted.12 Carer support resources are helpful for carer wellbeing and may delay the need for the older person who is receiving care to be relocated to a residential facility.7,13-15 People should be advised to plan as much as possible for their care as they get older to prevent family disruption in episodes of illness as well as unpleasant and undesired acute care interventions. This includes organising wills, financial enduring power of attorney, and the equivalent documentation for health and care (called enduring guardianship in some jurisdictions), and an advance care plan.16 The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners' (RACGP) position statement on the incorporation of advance care planning into routine general practice is available at www.racgp.org.au/download/documents/Policies/Clinical/advancedcareplanning_ positionstatement.pdf Medication-related problems may cause unnecessary hospital admissions, adverse drug reactions and other adverse outcomes for older people living in the community.17 General practitioners (GPs) should review medications in older people, particularly for vulnerable groups. Vulnerability factors include: recent discharge from hospital or other facility significant changes made to medication treatment regimen in the past three months high-risk drug groups (eg those with a narrow therapeutic index and those that cause xerostomia) confusion/cognitive impairment or dementia other causes of difficulty managing medications including literacy, language issues, dexterity problems, sight impairment inability to manage therapeutic devices history of falls currently taking five or more regular medications taking >12 doses of medication per day patients attending multiple doctors including GPs and specialists disease states where medication management is an important process of care (chronic kidney disease, congestive cardiac failure)18 multiple chronic medical problems regular use of alcohol previous adverse drug reaction anticholinergic load. GPs may consider a medication review, in particular focusing on reducing medications and anticholinergic load. The most successful interventions were delivered by small numbers of pharmacists working in close liaison with primary care doctors (III, C).19 The review should include consideration of the need for each medication; issues around patient compliance and understanding of the medication; screening for side effects, particularly falls and cognitive impairment; and consideration of the use of aids such as dosette boxes and Webster packaging. A review of the combined anticholinergic and sedative loads of the medications may also be done, as anticholinergic and sedative loads increase the rate of confusion and other adverse side effects.20-23 This process is often referred to as 'deprescribing'.2446 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition recommended for adults aged >65 years, according to the Australian immunisation handbook (which is regularly updated and available at www.immunise.health.gov.au/internet/immunise/publishing. nsf/Content/Handbook10-home ). However, the benefits are modest, with a number needed to treat of 71 people in the general population for influenza vaccination to prevent a single episode of influenza in older age.25 Table 5.1. Immunisation: Preventive interventions in older age Intervention Technique References Vaccination: Influenza Annual influenza vaccination in the pre-flu season months (III, C) 26 Vaccination: Pneumococcal 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (23vPPV) is recommended for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease (II, B) Vaccination should be done opportunistically. One dose is currently recommended, except for those who have a condition that predisposes them to an increased risk of invasive pneumococcal disease Refer to www.health.gov.au/internet/immunise/publishing.nsf/content/ older-australians 27 Vaccination: Herpes zoster A single dose of zoster vaccine is recommended for adults aged >60 years (II, B) Also refer to Section 6.1. Immunisation28 23vPPV, 23-valent pneumococcal about moderate physical activity is recommended for all older people (A).29 In addition, vigorous physical activity offers additional benefits for those without specific contraindications such as unstable, advanced or terminal illness. For the older person, physical activity provides many benefits, as well as minimising some of the limitations of later life.30 Benefits include: maintaining or improving physical function and independent living improving social interactions, quality of life, sleep and reducing depression building and maintaining healthy bones, muscles and joints, reducing the risk of injuries from falls reducing the risk of heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, some cancers and vascular disease and Alzheimer's dementia improving management of lung disease, heart disease, arthritis, osteoporosis, kidney disease, stroke, cancer, and other chronic conditions.47 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition The following are Australia's physical activity and sedentary behaviour guidelines for older people31 (www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/health-pubhlth-strateg-phys-act-guidelines#chba ): Older people: should do some form of physical activity, no matter what their age, weight, health problems or abilities should be active every day in as many ways as possible, doing a range of physical activities that incorporate fitness, strength, balance and flexibility should accumulate at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity on most, preferably all, days who have stopped physical activity, or who are starting a new physical activity, should start at a level that is easily manageable and gradually build up to the recommended amount, type and frequency of activity who continue to enjoy a lifetime of vigorous physical activity should carry on doing so in a manner suited to their capability into later life, provided recommended safety procedures and guidelines are adhered to. Refer to falls risk reduction in Table 5.3.2 for more information on specific exercises. 5.3 of people aged 65 years report one or more falls in the past 12 months.32 Most falls are caused by an interaction of multiple risk factors. Having one fall puts you at risk of another fall, and the more risk factors, the greater the chance of falling. You can help your patients manage their risk and prevent further falls by regularly asking them about falls. Table 5.3.1. Falls: Identifying risks Who is at risk of falls? What should be done? How often? References Average risk: All people aged 65 years Screen for falls (I, A) Every 12 months 29, 33 Moderately high risk: Older people presenting with one or more falls, who report recurrent falls or with multiple risk factors (refer to Table 5.3.2)Case find for risk factors and involve in preventive activities (I, A)Every six months 32, 3348 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Table 5.3.2. Falls: Preventive interventions Intervention Technique References Screening for falls risk Case finding questions about risk factors to be used in those at moderately high riskAsk the following three screening questions: 1. Have you had two or more falls in the past 12 months? 2. Are you presenting following a fall? 3. Are you having difficulty with walking or balance? If the answers to any of these are positive, complete a multifactorial risk assessment including obtaining relevant medical history, completing a physical examination, and performing cognitive and functional assessments History should include: -detailed history of falls (eg how many falls?, at home or outdoors?, patient perception of causes, any fear of falling) -multiple medications, and specific medications (eg psychotropic medications) -impaired gait, balance and mobility -foot pain and deformities, and unsafe footwear -home hazards -bifocal or multifocal spectacle use -incontinence -recent discharge from hospital -chronic illness such as stroke, multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease, cognitive impairment/dementia -vitamin D deficiency/poor sun exposure if housebound or in a care facility Physical examination should include: -impaired visual acuity, including cataracts should include: -dementia/cognitive impairment assessment (eg General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition [GPCOG]) -activities of daily living and home assessment as appropriate (eg by occupational therapist) -falls risk-assessment tools -if unsteady, gait and mobility assessment by physiotherapist There are many fall risk-assessment tools. However, reports from researchers are variable, so no single tool can be recommended for implementation in all settings or for all subpopulations within each setting Also refer to Chapter 13. Urinary incontinence32, 34-36 29, 32, 33, 37 29 38, 3949 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Intervention Technique References Falls risk reductionPrescribe or refer for a home-based exercise program and/or encourage participation in a community-based exercise program, particularly targeting balance and which may include strength and endurance (I) For specific exercises to reduce the risk of falls, refer to www.racgp.org.au/ your-practice/guidelines/handi/interventions/musculoskeletal/exercises-for- falls-prevention Patients who report unsteadiness or are at higher risk of falls should be referred to a health professional for individual exercise prescription. Referral should specify fall prevention Exercise programs targeting non-English-speaking patients may need to address cultural norms about appropriate levels of physical activity Exercise guidelines for fall prevention recommend the following: Exercise that specifically challenges balance is the most effective physical activity intervention to prevent falls Exercise needs to be done for at least two hours per week and continue as a lifetime activity Fall prevention exercises can be home-based or a group program. Walking or strength training as a single intervention does not appear to prevent falls Regularly review medication. Encourage patients to keep a medication review card. Reduce dose to address side effects and dose sensitivity, and stop medications that are no longer needed Medications that can promote falls include psychotropic medications, and medications with anticholinergic activity, sedation effects and hypotensive effects or orthostatic hypotensive side effects Also refer to Chapter 14. Osteoporosis A home assessment should be considered for those at moderately high to high risk of falls. Occupational therapy interventions can reduce fall hazards, raise awareness of fall risk and implement safety strategies. Referral should specify fall prevention Other risk factors should be managed actively including: using a multidisciplinary team (eg podiatrist regarding foot problems, optometrist regarding avoidance of multifocal lenses, physiotherapist or nurse regarding urge incontinence) referring to relevant medical specialists (eg ophthalmologist for cataract surgery, cardiologist for consideration of pacemaker) investigating the causes of dizziness40-47 29, 33 41 48, 49 33 29, 33 29, 33 *Two simple tests are the repeated chair standing test and alternate step test. The repeated chair standing test measures how quickly an older person can rise from a chair five times without using the arms. A time of >12 seconds indicates an increased fall risk. The alternate step test measures how quickly an older person can alternate steps (left, right, left, etc) onto an 18 cm high step a total of eight times. A time >10 seconds indicates an increased fall risk. The Quickscreen assessment tool, developed and validated for use in an Australian population, includes these tests as well as simple assessments of medication use, vision, sensation and balance.

There is no evidence that screening of asymptomatic older people results in improved vision.50,51 Hearing loss is a common problem among older individuals and is associated with significant physical, functional and mental health consequences. Annual questioning about hearing impairment is recommended with people aged >65 years (B). In some states and territories, there are legal requirements for annual assessment (eg driving aged >70 years).52 Eye disease and visual impairment increase three-fold with each decade of life after 40 years of age. They are often accompanied by isolation, depression and poorer social relationships, and are strongly associated with falls and hip fractures.53 It should be determined whether the patient is wearing up-to-date prescription spectacles, and whether there is a possibility of falls because the patient is no longer capable of managing a bifocal, trifocal or multifocal prescription. People at greater risk of visual loss are older people and those with diabetes and a family history of vision impairment; such history should be sought. Smoking (current or previous) increases the risk of age-related macular degeneration.54 Cataracts are the most common eye disease in Australians aged 65 years (42% of cases of visual impairment), followed by age-related macular degeneration (AMD; 30%), diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. The leading causes of blindness in those aged 65 years are AMD (55%), glaucoma (16%) and diabetic retinopathy (16%).55,56 Table 5.4.1.

These may be detected opportunistically and assessed using questions addressed to the person and/or their carer (C). Depression and dementia may co-exist. When a person has dementia, adequate support is required for the person, carer and family. Counselling and education are important. Management priorities will vary from patient to patient, but there may be a need to consider medical management of dementia, behaviour and comorbidity, legal and financial planning, current work situation, driving, and advance care planning.59 Table 5.5.1.

Dementia: Preventive interventions Intervention Technique References Case finding and confirmation Ask 'How is your memory?' and obtain information about dementia and other cognitive problems from others who know the person (eg repeating questions, forgetting conversations, double buying, unpaid bills, social withdrawal) Other symptoms may include a decline in thinking, planning and organising, and reduced emotional control or change in social behaviour affecting daily activities. Not everyone with dementia has memory problems as an initial symptom (C). Other clues are missed appointments (receptionist often knows), change in compliance with medications, and observable deterioration in grooming or dressing. Falls may also be an indication of cognitive impairment Over several consultations, obtain the history from the person and family/carer, and perform a comprehensive physical examination. Undertake cognitive assessment using: -Standardised Mini-Mental State Examination (SMMSE) available of Cognition at www.gpcog.com.au -clock test -Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment Scale at www.fightdementia.org.au/ understanding-dementia/rowland-universal-dementia-assessment-scale.aspx which is a multicultural cognitive assessment scale that has been used to detect dementia across cultures -The Kimberley Indigenous Cognitive Assessment tool (KICA) dementia assessment instrument (available at www.healthinfonet.ecu.edu.au/key- resources/programs-projects?pid=509 ), may be used as a component of dementia assessment for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples living in remote areas; and the modified KICA, may be used as a component of dementia assessment in more urban Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples -The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), is the most widely used and evaluated scale. However, as it is now copyrighted, it should be replaced by the SMMSE A suite of recommended rating tools is available at www.dementia-assessment.com.au Assess functional status. The Instrumental activities of daily living at www.abramsoncenter.org/media/1456/instrumental-activities-of-daily-living. pdf assessment tool may be used. All screening instruments used to assess dementia in general practice have high rates of overdiagnosis (false positives) and underdiagnosis (false negatives), so the full clinical presentation needs to be taken into account. Reassessment after 6-12 months may be helpful Assessment should include relevant blood tests and imaging to a exclude space- occupying lesion or other brain disorder Relevant tests are recommended in the Clinical practice guidelines for dementia in Australia available at http://sydney.edu.au/medicine/cdpc/documents/resources/ LAVER_Dementia_Guidleines_recommendations_PRVW5.pdf75-77 75 78 79 80, 8153 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Intervention Technique References Early intervention and preventionEvidence is growing that attention to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors may improve cognitive function and/or reduce dementia risk. There is sufficient evidence now for clinicians to recommend the following strategies for early intervention and prevention of dementia: increased physical activity (eg 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity walking or equivalent) social engagement (increased number of social activities per week) cognitive training and rehabilitation diet - the Mediterranean and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diets have been shown to be protective against cognitive decline smoking cessation management of vascular risk factors (refer to Chapter 8. Prevention of vascular and metabolic disease) use of the risk assessment tool developed by the Collaborative Research Centre, which is based on dementia prevention, and takes about 15 minutes to fill out and provides a good overview for all the possible risks for dementia, for discussion with the GP available at http://anuadri.anu.edu.au Refer to Chapter 7.

Neurology 2014;83(16):1410-6.57 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition 6. Communicable diseases General practitioners (GPs) have an important role in the prevention and management of communicable diseases. This includes advice on prevention, immunisation, early detection and management. The use of immunisation information systems1 such as the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register (ACIR) and Vaccination Information and Vaccination Administration System (VIVAS) in Queensland helps raise immunisation rates. The available information in these databases helps to create recall-and-reminder systems and individual immunisation records within GP electronic medical records. An adult immunisation register is planned from September 2016.2 Updates on communicable diseases and notification requirements are available from the Department of Health at www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda-surveil-nndss-casedefs-distype.htm Notification of particular infectious diseases to state public health units is mandatory (the law overrides all privacy regulations). This is almost completely automated by pathology laboratories, but for clinically diagnosed infections such as varicella and herpes zoster, the GP is required to notify the relevant authority. 6.1 Immunisation recommended from birth for all children, and at particular ages throughout life, according to the Australian immunisation handbook (this is updated regularly at www.health.gov.au/internet/immunise/publishing. nsf/Content/Handbook10-home ). Consent Consent should be sought from someone with legal capacity before each vaccination. The individual providing consent should have the intellectual capacity to understand specific information and agree voluntarily without pressure, coercion or manipulation. The consent process should include written advice about benefits and harms of the vaccines, risk of not having the vaccine, and what to do after receiving the vaccine. Information on providing valid consent is available at www.immunise.health.gov.au/internet/immunise/publishing.nsf/Content/Handbook10- home~handbook10part2~handbook10-2-1#2-1-3 The National Immunisation Program Schedule (NIPS) lists the recommended funded vaccines for all Australian residents. There may be other vaccines that are not funded but are recommended in the Australian immunisation handbook , depending on occupation or travel. There may be variability in vaccines recommended/funded (eg hepatitis A vaccine). Vaccination for special high-risk groups Adults or children who develop asplenia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or a haematological malignancy, or who have received a bone marrow or other transplant, may not be fit for some vaccinations, or may require additional or repeat vaccinations.58 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Health inequity What are the key equity issues and who is at risk? GPs need to be aware of groups with lower levels of age-appropriate immunisation.3 Socioeconomic characteristics associated with lower immunisation rates at 12 months4 include: being Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander being born overseas no private health insurance being in the highest or lowest socioeconomic quintile being of low birth weight and singleton birth. All of these factors were also associated with lower immunisation coverage at 24 months, with the exception of low birth weight, which was only significant in the very low birth weight category. What can GPs do? Evidence supports a number of strategies in improving immunisation rates that could reduce inequities if efforts were focused on at-risk groups: audit of immunisation coverage of at-risk groups in the practice use of recall-and-reminder systems and catch-up plans, with a focus on at-risk groups integrating vaccination status checks into routine health assessments for those target population groups.

Infants born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mothers should be given hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and a dose of monovalent hepatitis B vaccine on the day of birth (preferably within 12 hours of birth and certainly within 48 hours). Further information at www.health.gov.au/internet/immunise/publishing.nsf/Content/Handbook10-home Rotavirus vaccines are contraindicated in infants with a history of intussusception (IS), or predisposing abnormality to IS, or severe combined immunodeficiency.

The ACIR can be used to obtain information on the vaccination history of individuals from birth to 7 years of age given since 1 January 1996 National Centre for Immunisation Research & Surveillance, available at www.ncirs.edu.au Notification of adverse events The reporting of adverse events following vaccinations varies geographically. It is possible to report directly to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) from anywhere in Australia by telephone on 1800 044 114, or online at www.tga.gov.au/hp/problem-medicine-reporting-reactions.htm61 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition 6.2 Sexually transmissible infections Sexually transmissible infections (STIs) are frequently seen in general practice, especially chlamydia, which is typically asymptomatic.5,6 It is important to detect it early in order to prevent transmission to others and minimise potential complications, such as infertility. It may also be appropriate to screen for other STIs. The individual's age, sexual behaviour and community HIV or STI prevalence all influence the level of risk, and should influence the choice of STI screening tests. For additional resources specific to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners' (RACGP) National guide to a preventive health assessment for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people , 2nd edn, includes information about sexual health and blood-borne viruses ( www.racgp.org.au/your-practice/guidelines/national-guide ). Sexual health consultation Many patients and doctors feel uncomfortable discussing sexual histories even when indicated or the patient is requesting STI testing. Taking a sexual history is an important part of the assessment and management of STIs, and it should not be a barrier to offering STI testing.7 A non-judgmental attitude and environment will facilitate disclosures on sexual matters.8 It is important to ask open- ended questions and to avoid assumptions about sexual orientation, by using the term 'partner'. Gentle enquiry about recent sexual activity, gender, number of partners, contraception (including use of condoms), travel history, and immunisation status helps to inform decision making. Additionally, ask about the risk for blood-borne viruses (hepatitis B, C, and HIV), such as injecting drug use, tattooing and piercing. Investigations should be explained, and patients should be asked for consent before tests such as HIV or hepatitis C are ordered. Contact tracing Contact tracing is essential in reducing the transmission of STIs and HIV. It is the responsibility of the diagnosing clinician to facilitate the process of notifying current and past partners. This may be through a direct approach from the patient, their treating health professional, or by using online partner notification services available such as: www.letthemknow.org.au www.thedramadownunder.info/notify (for men who have sex with men [MSM]) www.bettertoknow.org.au (for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youths). For more information and to determine 'how far back to trace', refer to the contact tracing manual at the Australasian Society of HIV, Viral Hepatitis and Sexual Health Medicine's (ASHM) website at http://contacttracing. ashm.org.au or the Contact Tracing Tool for General Practitioners at NSW STI Programs Unit's website at http:// stipu.nsw.gov.au/wp-content/uploads/GP-Contact-Tracing-Tool.pdf For HIV contact tracing, seek assistance from local sexual health services. In the case of a notifiable condition, the patient should be informed that case notification to public health authorities will occur. Notification should be made as set by the department of health in the relevant state or territory.62 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition 6.2.1 Chlamydia infections occur in people <29 years of age.9 Screening for chlamydia infection in all sexually active people up to 29 years of age is recommended because of increased prevalence and risk of complications.10 In asymptomatic, sexually active people up to 29 years of age, the overall absolute risk of infection is approximately 5% for chlamydia and 0.5% for gonorrhoea. The ranked risk for specific infections per 100,000 in general population/Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations:11 Chlamydia B (23/50) Syphilis (8/32) HIV (4/6) A large proportion of young people will attend primary care clinics each year, and this presents the opportunity to normalise sexual health care as part of usual general practice.10 Younger sexually active youths should not be excluded from case finding, or identifying any safety or abuse issues. This may involve a complete psychosocial (HE2ADS3)12 risk assessment as discussed in Table 3.2. Women with untreated chlamydia infections have a 2-8% risk of infertility.13 Other STIs to consider screening for in higher risk individuals are gonorrhoea, HIV and syphilis.14 The risk for gonorrhoea, HIV and syphilis is low for heterosexuals in all major cities in Australia and New Zealand,15 but rates of gonorrhoea and syphilis are higher among MSM. The individual's age and sexual habits, and community STI prevalence all influence the level of risk and should guide STI testing recommendations for patients (refer to Tables 6.2.1.1 and 6.2.1.2 for guidance). MSM should be screened for gonorrhoea, chlamydia, syphilis and HIV every 12 months. Screening should be performed more often if they have multiple sexual contacts. Most MSM with STIs have no symptoms.16 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are at higher risk and should also be screened for gonorrhoea, chlamydia, syphilis and HIV. Screening for hepatitis C should be provided if the patient is HIV positive or there is a history of injecting drug use, as this increases the risk of transmission.16 All pregnant women should be screened for hepatitis B, C, HIV and syphilis.14,17,18 Consider screening pregnant women up to 29 years of age for chlamydia (and also gonorrhoea, if the patient is at high risk).17-2063 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Table 6.2.1.1.

Notification rates per 100,000 increased from 35.4 in 1993 to 363 in 2011, and has been steady since; 78% of those infected are aged 15-29 years.11 Young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have higher infection rates especially in regional and remote areas, with a substantially increased risk of chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis.10 Screening sexually active women <25 years of age for chlamydia on an annual basis has been shown to halve the infection and complication rates.11,13,35 Treatment of partners and contact tracing All partners of those infected should be tested and treated presumptively. A systematic review has shown that providing patient-delivered partner therapy to index cases is more effective in reducing infection rates than paper- based methods of contact tracing.36 There is no single optimal strategy for contact tracing. Getting assistance from the local sexual health services is recommended for HIV and syphilis because it leads to more contacts being tested and treated.35 Referral to sexual health services should be considered for problematic or repeated infections.37 It is important to ensure current sexual partners are treated simultaneously. Untreated pregnant women infected with chlamydia have a 20-50% chance of infecting their infant at delivery.38 References 1. Community Preventive Services Task Force (USA).

Prevention of chronic disease The lifestyle risk factors of smoking, nutrition, alcohol and physical activity (SNAP) are common among patients attending general practice.1 They contribute significantly to the burden of disease, largely due to their effect on the incidence and complications of chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic respiratory disease and some cancers.2 General practitioners (GPs) and their teams can make an important contribution to managing each of the SNAP lifestyle behaviours, including smoking,3,4 dietary change,5 hazardous drinking,6 physical activity7,8 and weight.9,10 Each of these risk factors may interact with the others throughout the lifecycle and need to be considered together rather than separately.11 The 5As is an internationally accepted framework for organising the assessment and management of behavioural risk factors in primary healthcare.12-14 It consists of the following: Ask - A systematic approach to asking all patients about their SNAP , which may occur opportunistically as they present for other conditions and/or by recall for health checks. Assess - Assess readiness to change, and dependence (for smoking and alcohol). Advise - Provide brief, non-judgemental advice with patient education materials. Assist/agree - Work with the patient to set agreed goals for behaviour change; provide motivational interviewing; refer to telephone support services, group lifestyle programs or individual providers (eg dietitian or exercise physiologist); consider pharmacotherapy. Arrange - Regular follow-up visits to monitor maintenance and prevent relapse. Progress along the pathway from assessment and advice to goal setting, referral and follow-up is associated with increased patient motivation and behaviour change.15 A number of evidence-based preventive care guidelines are based on the 5As framework.9 Health inequity What are the key equity issues and who is at risk? The greatest burden of chronic illness is experienced by socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, who access preventive healthcare less frequently than other groups.16-18 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have a significantly lower life expectancy at birth than non-Indigenous Australians. This is attributable, to a significant extent, to inequities in prevalence and care for chronic diseases.19,20 This gap appears to be widening and is the widest seen globally between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations.21 Multimorbidity is more common in disadvantaged groups and is associated with higher levels of psychosocial stress.22,23 The uptake of preventive and screening services in primary healthcare is significantly related to higher levels of education, health motivation, and self-rated health, as well as to particular cultural groups. Immigrant groups undergo fewer preventive consultations and screening tests, and have overall less primary care utilisation.24 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and socioeconomically deprived people have higher risks of disease, but are less likely to be offered preventive interventions.25 Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with higher rates of smoking and alcohol use, poorer diets and lower levels of physical activity. The higher rates are a product of social, environmental and individual factors. Smoking rates show significant inequities across groups. Most disadvantaged groups continue to have higher smoking rates. Smoking status varies by education level, employment status, socioeconomic status (SES), geographic location and Indigenous status.26,27 Nationally, the prevalence of smoking among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples (45%) is more than double that of non-Indigenous Australians, and is up to 82% in remote communities.28,29 Smoking is also more prevalent in people with long-term mental illness.3067 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Overweight and obesity rates are higher in socioeconomically disadvantaged groups and the gap is widening.31-33 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have higher rates of being overweight and obese as well as a higher incidence of vascular disease.34 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in remote regions face significant access barriers to nutritious and affordable food.35,36 Nutritious food tends to cost more in rural and remote areas, and cost may also be an issue in low SES groups.37,38 Low-income groups are less likely to be offered interventions to prevent being overweight.39 Alcohol may produce a greater burden of harm in more socially disadvantaged groups partly through the more hazardous pattern of drinking and partly through reduced access to resources to mitigate harm.40-43 Recognition and treatment are also impeded by the social stigma associated with problematic use of alcohol.44-46 What can GPs do? Interventions targeting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples could include individual and group interventions delivered in primary healthcare and community settings to promote improved health literacy and awareness of behavioural risk factors.47 Financial assistance to enable healthier food choices may be effective.48 The Centre for Excellence in Indigenous Tobacco Control (CEITC) provides resources and strategies at www.ceitc.org.au Improvements in physical activity for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients may be achieved by linking health advice with locally available and appropriate community sport and recreation programs, as well as social support programs such as group activities.34,49 Provide motivational interviewing for at-risk patients with low SES.50-52 Individual behavioural counselling is more likely to be effective for patients from disadvantaged backgrounds if linked to community resources, and if financial and access barriers are addressed.53,54 Interventions to improve physical activity among socially disadvantaged patients would ideally be linked to community programs that improve the physical environment, are culturally acceptable and address cost barriers.55-57 Supportive provider attitudes are also important in building self-efficacy among patients from these groups.58 Be aware that behavioural risk factors are not simply a matter of 'individual lifestyle choices'. For example, racism and stress may be drivers of smoking for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and dietary choices may be shaped significantly by availability, cost and distribution of healthy food. Quality improvement activities, especially clinical audit and practice plans, can help improve the assessment and recording of behavioural risk factors.59 status and interest in quitting should be assessed and documented in the medical record for every patient >10 years of age.3,13,60 All patients who smoke, regardless of the amount they smoke, should be offered smoking cessation advice. This should include the following actions: Ask about their interest in quitting (B). Advise to stop smoking (A), agreeing on quit goals and offer pharmacotherapy to all patients smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day unless contraindicated, especially if there is evidence of nicotine dependence (A). Offer referral to a proactive telephone call-back cessation service (eg Quitline 13 7848; A). Follow up to support maintenance and prevent relapse using self-help or pharmacotherapy (A). To assess nicotine dependence, ask about the:60 number of minutes between waking and smoking the first cigarette number of cigarettes smoked a day (there is a high likelihood of nicotine dependence if the person smokes within 30 minutes of waking and smokes more than 10-15 cigarettes a day) type of craving or withdrawal symptoms experienced in previous quit attempts.68 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Table 7.1.1.

Non-judgmental enquiry about smoking is associated with greater patient satisfaction64-66 Implementation At an individual patient level, GPs and their teams can influence smoking rates by systematically providing opportunistic advice and offering support to all attending patients who smoke.67 Where this is insufficient, other effective treatment strategies include referral to the Quitline,68 pharmacotherapy69,70 and motivational interviewing.71,72 Tobacco use is most effectively treated with a comprehensive approach involving behavioural support and pharmacotherapy. Combined pharmacotherapy and behavioural support increases the success of smoking cessation.73 Pregnant women find it especially difficult to quit; pregnancy alters nicotine metabolism and heightens withdrawal symptoms and the support from partners is an important element in quitting. Higher smoking rates in disadvantaged individuals reflect greater neighbourhood disadvantage, less social support, greater negative effect 69 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition and lower self-efficacy.21,28 Removing access barriers and providing incentives to motivate patients to quit may improve quit rates. Patients should be reviewed within one week and again after one month of stopping smoking in order to help increase the long-term chance of quitting. There is a lack of consistent, bias-free evidence that acupuncture, acupressure or laser therapy have sustained benefit on smoking cessation for longer than six months.74 There is insufficient evidence that electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) help smokers to stop smoking when compared with nicotine patches or placebo.75 The CEITC provides resources and strategies index (BMI) and waist circumference should be measured every two years and recorded in the medical record (A). On its own, BMI may be misleading, especially in older people and muscular individuals, and classifications may need to be adjusted for some ethnic groups.9 Waist circumference is a stronger predictor of CVD and diabetes than weight alone.76,77 Patients who are overweight or obese should be offered individual lifestyle education and skills training (A).9 Restrictive dieting is not recommended for children and most adolescents who have not completed their growth spurt.9 A modest loss of 5-10% of starting body weight in adults who are overweight is sufficient to achieve some health benefits.9,7870 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Table 7.2.1.

Advise the risks of being overweight and a lifestyle program that includes reduced caloric intake (aiming for 600 kcal or 2500 kJ energy deficit) and increased physical activity (increasing to 60 minutes at moderate intensity five days per week), supported by behavioural counselling Assist/Agree : Discuss goals, including a realistic initial target of 5% weight loss and specific measurable changes to diet and physical activity. Make contact (eg visit, phone) two weeks after commencing weight loss to determine adherence and if goals are being met. If no response (<1 kg weight or <1 cm waist reduction) after three months, consider alternative approaches, including referral to lifestyle programs or coaching. These programs may be face to face or delivered by phone Arrange : After achieving initial weight loss, advise that patients may regain weight without a maintenance program that includes support, monitoring and relapse prevention Consider very low energy diets if there is no response to lifestyle programs. Bariatric surgery may be considered in patients who fail lifestyle interventions and who have a BMI >35 kg/m2 with comorbidities, such as poorly controlled diabetes, who are expected to improve with weight reduction9, 81 BMI, body mass index72 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Table 7.2.3.

Individual education and simple behavioural interventions are appropriate for some patients, while behavioural approaches may be more appropriate for those with disordered eating patterns. Behaviour change techniques include goal setting, self-monitoring of behaviour and progress, stimulus control (eg recognising and avoiding triggers that prompt unplanned eating), cognitive restructuring (modifying unhelpful thoughts or thinking patterns) or problem-solving, and relapse prevention and management.9 Telephone coaching has been demonstrated to be comparable with face-to-face techniques and is available in most states.83,84 For adolescents and children, lifestyle programs should focus on parents, carers and families. Advise that weight maintenance is an acceptable approach in most situations for children who are overweight or obese. Recommend lifestyle changes, including reducing energy intake and sedentary behaviour, and increasing physical activity based on current Australian dietary and physical activity guidelines.9 For more information, refer to The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners' (RACGP) Smoking, Nutrition, Alcohol and Physical activity (SNAP): A population health guide to behavioural risk82 and National Health and Medical Reserach Council's (NHMRC) Clinical practice guidelines for the management of overweight and obesity in adults, adolescents and children in Australia .973 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition 7.3 Nutrition adults how many portions of fruits or vegetables they eat in a day and advise to follow the NHMRC's Australian dietary guidelines (B).85 Brief advice should be given to eat two serves of fruit and five serves of vegetables per day (2 + 5 portions), and to limit sugar, saturated fat, salt and alcohol. Breastfeeding should be promoted as the most appropriate method for feeding infants (and one that offers protection against infection and some chronic diseases).85 Refer to Chapter 3.

Nutrition-related complications: Preventive interventions Intervention Technique References Vitamin supplements Vitamin supplementation is not of established value in asymptomatic individuals* (with the exception of folate and iodine in pregnancy). Routine screening for vitamin D deficiency is not recommended in low-risk populations85 Dietary recommendationsEnjoy a wide variety of foods each day, including: five serves of vegetables (of different types and colours, and legumes/ beans) and two serves of fruit grain or cereals (mostly wholegrain and/or high fibre varieties such as breads, rice, pasta, noodles, polenta, couscous, oats, quinoa and barley) lean meats, fish, poultry, eggs, tofu, nuts and seeds and drink plenty of water. Take care to: limit saturated fat and reduce salt limit alcohol intake avoid sugary beverages including soft drink and limit fruit juices limit sugars and foods containing added sugars limit red meat (three to four times per week) and limit or avoid processed meat care for food: prepare and store it safely encourage and support breastfeeding For specific advice, especially patients with specific conditions, refer to a dietitian The National Heart Foundation of Australia has a number of nutrition position statements at http://heartfoundation.org.au/for-professionals/food-and- nutrition/position-statements In children, overweight or obesity is associated with sweet drink consumption, and dental problems are associated with consumption of fatty foods and sweet drinks85 88 89 Encourage breastfeedingEncourage and support exclusive breastfeeding until 4 to 6 months of age (there is current controversy about when to introduce foods; refer to Practice Point c in Table 3.2). It is recommended that breastfeeding continue until 12 months of age and thereafter as long as is mutually desired85 *Prevalence of nutritional deficiency is high in certain groups, such as people with alcohol dependence and the elderly living alone or in institutions. For further information, refer to the RACGP's SNAP guide, 2nd edn,82 and NHMRC's Australian dietary guidelines .8575 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition 7.4 Early detection of at-risk patients should be asked about the quantity and frequency of alcohol intake from 15 years of age (A).6 Those with at-risk patterns of alcohol consumption should be offered brief advice on the risk in drinking (A).90 Motivational interviewing is both a useful and effective counselling strategy to facilitate a decrease of alcohol intake to low-risk drinking (I, B).91-94 Table 7.4.1.

Strategies to increase effectiveness Intervention Technique References Screening Early detection of at-risk drinking may be improved by asking patients about their drinking more frequently. New patient registration, health assessment, chronic disease or mental health assessments and care planning are acceptable times for enquiry122, 123 Brief intervention Screening and brief advice in general practice has been demonstrated to have resulted in a reduction in drinking of about four to six standard drinks per week for men While there is no clear dose-response curve for spending more time counselling subjects who are drinking at risky levels, the minimum time to achieve some impact is between five and 15 minutes. Although some have argued that screening, of itself, constitutes a brief intervention, the impact of interventions of less than five minutes is less clear Components of effective interventions include: -motivational interviewing, especially being more person-centred and eliciting change talk -asking about drinking and its consequences -personalised feedback about impact on health -goal setting90, 124-126 126-129 124, 130, 131 Management of dependence or heavy drinking Brief interventions and routine GP care are likely to be insufficient for patients with alcohol dependence or heavy drinking. Such patients should be referred to a drug and alcohol service132 Implementation There is some evidence from earlier systematic reviews that for every 10 hazardous drinkers treated using brief interventions, one will reduce drinking to low-risk levels.102,133,134 For more information, refer to the RACGP's SNAP guide, 2nd edn.82 7.5 patient's current level of physical activity and sedentary behaviour, and assess against current guidelines. Provide age-specific advice on meeting recommended levels of sedentary behaviour and physical activity. The message that any physical activity is better than none is important. If a patient does not already engage in regular physical activity, they can be encouraged to start by doing some, and then gradually build up to the recommended amount.135 Advice, written physical activity materials and referral should be tailored to age (refer to Table 7.5.1).78 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Table 7.5.1. Physical activity: Assessment, advice and referral Age and risk group What should be done? How often? References Children 0-5 years of age From birth, encourage physical activity, particularly supervised floor-based play in safe environments Toddlers and pre-schoolers should be physically active every day for at least three hours, spread throughout the day (Practice Point) Recommend children <2 years of age not spend time in front of screens. From two to five years of age recommend limiting screen time to one hour per day (Practice Point)At times of child health surveillance or immunisation (Practice Point)136 Children 5-17 years of age Ask questions regarding current level of activity and sedentary behaviour, and assess against current guidelines (II, A) Recommend accumulating 60 minutes of a variety of moderate or vigorous aerobic physical activity per day (I, A) and muscle strengthening activity three days a week (II, A) Recommend limiting or breaking up sitting time and use of screens to no more than two hours a day (Practice Point)Opportunistically 136 Adults 18-64 years of age Ask questions regarding current level of activity and sedentary behaviour, and assess against current guidelines (II, A) Recommend doing some activity on most days of the week. Accumulate 2.5-5 hours of moderate intensity physical activity, 1.25-2.5 hours of vigorous intensity physical activity, or a combination of these per week (III, A). Do muscle strengthening activities at least two days a week (I, A) Avoid prolonged sitting and break up periods of sitting (III, C)Every two years (III, C)135 People 65 years of age Ask questions regarding current level of activity and sedentary behaviour, and assess against current guidelines (II, A) Recommend some physical activity every day that improves fitness, strength, balance and flexibility (III, C) Gradually increase amount and frequency (Practice Point) Accumulate at least 30 minutes of moderate activity on most days (III, C; refer to Section 5.2 . Physical activity )Every two years 137, 13879 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Age and risk group What should be done? How often? References Increased risk Those at higher risk include teenage girls, older adults, office workers, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and people from low socioeconomic and non-English-speaking backgrounds Those with or at high risk of a chronic condition or cancer (refer to Chapter 8. Prevention of vascular and metabolic disease, and Chapter 9. Cancer)Ask questions regarding current level of activity and sedentary behaviour and assess against current guidelines (III, C) Provide brief interventions (refer to below) and age-appropriate written physical activity materials (III, C) Refer to an exercise or physical activity professional or program if appropriate brief interventions within the general practice cannot be offered (I, D) or if preferred by the patient (Practice Point) Programs with additional behaviour change support may be more beneficial (III, C)At least two yearly and opportunistically (IV, D)139-141 142, 143 Table 7.5.2. Physical inactivity interventions Assessment and intervention Technique References Brief interventions to increase levels of physical activitySome of the components of interventions in general practice that have been shown to have short-term benefit in changing behaviour related to physical activity include: at least two sessions of face-to-face provision of brief advice or counselling on exercise with supporting written materials written prescription for exercise and/or supplementary advice or counselling by telephone pedometer step target that is incremental and agreed with the patient 142, 144 Physical activity program Structured programs of physical activity education and exercise may be delivered as individual or group program and over several sessions. The National Heart Foundation of Australia's program is available at http://heartmoves.heartfoundation.org.au and some local councils have information on local physical activity programs. Exercise physiologists are listed at www.essa.org.au Non-face-to-face programs using telephone or internet have been demonstrated to be effective in adults >50 years of age It should be noted that there is limited research examining the effectiveness of exercise referral and none comparing exercise referrals to general practice-based physical activity interventions145, 146 143, 147 Implementation Physically inactive patients may be referred to physical activity programs or classes run by local community organisations. Those who have a chronic medical condition and complex needs may benefit from referral to an accredited exercise physiologist or physiotherapist.

Prevention of vascular and metabolic disease Cardiovascular disease (CVD) occurs in 18% of Australians. It accounts for 36% of all deaths and 6.9% of all disability.1 The most important behavioural and physiological risk factors for CVD are smoking, diabetes, raised blood pressure (BP), dyslipidaemia, obesity, physical inactivity and poor diet.2 These risk factors are common in the Australian population: 90% of adults aged >45 years have at least one modifiable risk factor and 66% have three or more risk factors for CVD.3 In addition to these, a family history of premature heart disease in a first-degree relative,4 history of depression, social isolation and lack of quality social support are recognised risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD).5 Health inequity What are the key equity issues and who is at risk? CVD: Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with higher rates of CVD.6 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, people living in rural and remote areas, and people in lower socioeconomic groups, all have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.6 Minority groups have high risk factor rates of cardiovascular disease globally.6,7 Type 2 diabetes (T2D): There is a higher prevalence of T2D among Australians in the lower socioeconomic groups.8 T2D is more than twice as common in the most disadvantaged communities.9 Certain ethnic groups are more at risk.10 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are three times more likely to have diabetes than non-Indigenous Australians, and T2D is a direct or indirect cause for 20% of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander deaths.11 CVD risk factors: Biological and behavioural risk factors play a role in increasing cardiovascular risk (refer to Chapter 7. Prevention of chronic disease). However, while smoking, nutrition, alcohol and physical activity (SNAP) risk factors exhibit clear socioeconomic gradients,10,12 the higher prevalence of vascular and metabolic disease is only partly mediated by behavioural risk factors and is more consistently observed in women.13 Diabetes and CVD are more common in rural populations, and this is exacerbated by poorer access to healthcare.14 There is evidence that men from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds may be less likely to be offered statins.15 Chronic kidney disease (CKD): Disadvantaged groups have higher rates of CKD for which type 2 diabetic nephropathy is a common cause.16,17 Over the past 25 years, the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples commencing renal replacement therapy was 3.5 times greater than the majority of the population. CKD has an earlier onset in Indigenous peoples.18-20 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are 10 times more likely than non-Indigenous Australians to be hospitalised for CKD, and, from 2008 to 2012, CKD was responsible for or associated with 16% of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander deaths.11 What can GPs do? Inequities in diabetes care can be ameliorated using a structured systems-based approach to care targeting at- risk and minority populations using diabetes registries.21 Social disadvantage may be a factor in poor medication adherence in patients with chronic disease.22,23 Interventions that can help improve medication adherence include those that target the barriers created by socioeconomic status (SES) and the treatment itself.23 Underuse of cardiovascular medications is common in older adults at high risk of CVD, and may be a factor in inequity in cardiovascular outcomes.2486 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Effective chronic disease interventions are likely to be those that address the determinants of behavioural risk factors that arise from root social causes such as poverty and low health literacy.6 Interventions delivered in community settings that target families and are multifaceted to incorporate the social context are generally the most successful.25,26 Trust is an important element in the delivery of culturally competent health service to patients with chronic diseases, particularly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Key ways to improve healthcare delivery are to respond to social complexity; promote empowerment, trust and rapport; and reduce discrimination and racism. To do so requires not only practice-system change but also Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural training of health professionals to build culturally safe environments.27,28 Continuity of care and patient-centred care are also important. Culturally specific interventions are needed and there are ongoing initiatives to develop these.29-33 8.1 Assessment of absolute cardiovascular disease Torres Strait Islander peoples Absolute CVD risk assessment combines risk factors to calculate the probability that an individual will develop a cardiovascular event (eg myocardial infarction, stroke) or other vascular disease within a specified time frame (usually five years). Absolute CVD risk assessment should be conducted at least every two years in all adults aged >45 years who are not known to have CVD or to be at clinically determined high risk (B).34 This calculation requires information on the patient's age, sex, smoking status, total and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and whether the patient is known to have diabetes or left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). In adults at low absolute CVD risk, blood test results within five years may be used for review of absolute CVD risk unless there are reasons to the contrary.34 Adults >74 years of age may have their absolute CVD risk assessed with age entered as 74 years. This is likely to underestimate five-year risk but will give an estimate of minimum risk.35 Patients with a family history of premature CVD (in a first-degree relative - men aged <55 years, women aged <65 years)4 or obesity (body mass index [BMI] above 30 kg/m2 or more) may be at greater risk.36-38 Similarly, patients with depression and atrial fibrillation (AF) may also be at increased risk.3487 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Table 8.1.1.

Australian cardiovascular disease risk charts) or online at www.cvdcheck.org.au Blood lipid results within five years can be used in the calculation of absolute CVD risk, but blood pressure (BP) should be measured at the time of assessment. On-therapy measures of BP and cholesterol may underestimate absolute risk, and thus, recently recorded pre-treatment measures may be more appropriate to use if available. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is not required to determine left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) if it is not previously known. Other absolute CVD risk calculators have been developed but most should not be applied to the Australian population. Adults with any of the following do not require absolute CVD risk assessment using the absolute risk calculator, because they are already known to be at clinically determined high risk of CVD (IV, D): diabetes and >60 years of age diabetes g/min males, >3.5 mg/mmol for females) moderate or severe chronic kidney disease (CKD; persistent proteinuria or estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] m2) diagnosis pressure (SBP) 110 mmHg serum total cholesterol >7.5 mmol/L Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander peoples aged >74 years (Practice Point) BP , blood should be measured in all adults from 18 years of age (A) at least every two years.

The Australian type 2 diabetes risk assesment tool (AUSDRISK) is useful in assessing risk of diabetes. Preventive interventions (refer to Table 8.4.3) have been shown to reduce progression to diabetes in patients with impaired fasting glucose. Patients at high risk should be screened for diabetes every three years from 40 years of age. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples should have their risk of diabetes assessed every three years from 18 years of age. Screening should be part of a comprehensive CVD assessment including BP , lipids, smoking, physical activity, diet, overweight and obesity. Table 8.4.1.

People at high risk should be questioned about symptoms of TIA to determine appropriate action. Adults with AF should have their absolute CVD risk assessed and the cause of their AF determined and treated according to cardiovascular and thromboembolic risk (II, B). Table 8.5.1. Stroke: Identifying risk Who is at risk? What should be done? How often? References High absolute risk: Calculated >15% absolute risk, clinically determined high risk or pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) Previous stroke (especially with co-existent atrial fibrillation [AF] or high grade [70-99%] symptomatic carotid stenosis) Previous transient ischaemic attack (TIA)Question about symptoms of TIA. If TIA, stratify risk of stroke and consider anticoagulation* (I, A) If AF, determine cause of AF and treat according to cardiovascular and thromboembolic risk (II, B) Manage behavioural and physiological risk factors actively. Treat with antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications unless contraindicated or clinically inappropriate (II, B)Every 12 (IV, in asymptomatic people is not recommended in the general adult population as a screening tool for stroke risk. Screening with duplex ultrasonography in this population is not cost-effective (yields many false positive results). In addition, the overall benefit of surgery is, at best, small; hence, very careful selection of patients is needed to justify surgery in those with severe (>60%) but asymptomatic stenosis However, the presence of a carotid bruit has been shown to be associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death, so may be a useful prognostic marker when assessing cardiovascular risk generally Screen patients with known asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis for other treatable causes of stroke and treat these intensively67, 69-71 67 *Anticoagulation therapy for long-term secondary prevention should be used in people with ischaemic stroke or TIA who have documented atrial fibrillation or cardio-embolic stroke Antiplatelet therapy should be considered for non-cardio-embolic stroke or TIA atrial fibrillation; CVD, cardiovascular disease; TIA, transient ischaemic attack95 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Table 8.5.2. Tests to detect stroke risk Test Technique References Question about transient ischaemic attack (TIA) ABCD2 toolQuestion patient or carer regarding symptoms of sudden onset of loss of focal neurological function such as weakness or numbness of arms or legs, speech disturbance, double vision or vertigo All patients with suspected TIA should have stroke risk assessment, which may include the ABCD2 tool: Age: >60 years (1 point) BP: >140/90 mmHg (1 point) Clinical features: Unilateral weakness (2 points), speech impairment without weakness (1 point) Duration: >60 minutes (2 points), 10-59 minutes (1 point) Diabetes (1 point) Important additional information required: presence of atrial fibrillation (AF) signs that might indicate carotid disease (eg anterior circulation signs), in people who are candidates for carotid surgery 2 TIAs within the previous seven days (crescendo TIA) For those deemed high risk (ABCD2 tool = 4-7 and/or AF, potential carotid disease or crescendo TIA): Urgent brain and carotid imaging ('urgent' is considered immediately, but certainly within 24 hours). If carotid territory symptoms, consider duplex ultrasound for patients who are potential candidates for carotid revascularisation For those deemed low risk (ABCD2 tool = 0-3 without AF, potential carotid disease or crescendo TIA): Refer for computed tomography (CT) of brain (and carotid ultrasound where indicated) as soon as possible (ie within 48-72 hours)68, 72 Assess the need for anticoagulationA decision to anticoagulate someone with AF can be assisted by stroke ischaemic attack For further information about secondary prevention after stroke or TIA, refer to https://strokefoundation.com.au Also refer to Chapter 15.

Notes: The risk charts include values for SBP alone as this is the most informative of conventionally measured blood pressure parameters for cardiovascular risk. For specific groups, additional guidance includes: The Framingham Risk Equation has not been validated for all population groups, the assessment score should be interpreted with caution in the following groups: The Framingham Risk Equation may underestimate CVD risk in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples (EBR Grade D); adults with diabetes aged between 45 and 60 years (EBR Grade C); adults aged over 74 years (CBR), however, available evidence suggests that this approach will provide an estimate of minimum cardiovascular risk. The Framingham Risk Equation is likely to underestimate CVD risk in adults with socioeconomic deprivation (an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease) (PP) or depression (PP). The predictive value of the Framingham Risk Equation has not been specifically assessed in adults who are overweight or obese (EBR Grade D). The increased risk of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality , in addition to thromboembolic disease including stroke, should be taken into account for adults with atrial fibrillation (particularly those aged over 65 years) (PP).

There are many risk factors for cancers that GPs can explore - most are specific to each cancer. 9.1 Prostate cancer a preventive activity Screening of asymptomatic (low-risk) men for prostate cancer by prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing is not recommended because the benefits have not clearly been shown to outweigh the harms.1 This remains the case following recent large trials.1 Therefore, GPs have no obligation to offer prostate cancer screening to asymptomatic men. Some men may have individual concerns about prostate cancer and may put a higher value on the possible benefits of prostate cancer screening. This requires specific discussion to address the benefits and harms (from overdiagnosis and overtreatment) of prostate cancer screening.2 The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) has produced a patient decision aid that may assist this discussion ( www.racgp.org.au/ your-practice/guidelines/prostate-cancer ). If after an informed process , perhaps using a decision aid, a man still requests prostate cancer screening, a PSA blood test is acceptable.3 Digital rectal examination (DRE) is no longer recommended as it is insufficiently sensitive to detect prostate cancers early enough.4 Clinicians should not test for asymptomatic prostate cancer (eg by adding the PSA test to a battery of other tests) without counselling about possible harms as well as possible benefits, and obtaining informed consent. Table 9.1.1. Prostate cancer: Identifying risk Who is at risk? What should be done? How often? References Average risk: The risk of developing prostate cancer increases with age and positive family history. However, because prostate cancer is normally slow growing, men aged >75 years or with a life expectancy of <10 years are at reduced threat of dying from a diagnosis of prostate cancer Men with uncomplicated lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) do not appear to have an increased risk of prostate cancer. The most common cause of LUTS is benign prostate enlargement. Early prostate cancer often does not have symptomsRespond to requests for screening by informing patients of risks and benefits of screening using a decision support aid (I, A)On demand (Practice Point)5, 6 High risk: Men with one or more first-degree relatives diagnosed <65 years of age Men with a first-degree relative with familial breast cancer ( BRCA1 or BRCA2 )Respond to requests for screening by informing patients of risks and benefits of screening (Practice Point)On demand (Practice Point)5-7 LUTS, lower urinary tract symptoms105 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Table 9.1.2. Screening for prostate cancer in asymptomatic men Not recommended Justification References Prostate specific antigen (PSA) screeningThe most common adverse effect of radical prostatectomy is erectile dysfunction, which affects most men (it is less common in younger men, those with a lower PSA, and when nerve-sparing surgical techniques are used) Other complications are common as well, including urinary incontinence (which is very common in the months after treatment; however, this returns to normal in 75-90% men after two years, depending on treatment type). To a lesser extent, urinary irritation and bowel symptoms can occur. General feelings of 'vitality' are lost in about 10% of men Both suicide and cardiovascular disease (CVD) increase enormously (eight and 11 times more respectively) in the week after men are given their diagnosis of prostate cancer Even diagnostic procedures performed following positive screening can be harmful, with Australian data showing that the risk of life-threatening sepsis needing intensive care admission is about 1% after biopsy Despite large trials, two meta-analysis suggests that prostate cancer screening does not save lives For more information on benefits and harms, visit the Clinical practice guidelines PSA testing and early management of test-detected prostate cancer at http://wiki.cancer.org.au/australia/Guidelines:PSA_Testing/About_this_guideline4, 8-11 12 13, 14 15 2, 8 CVD, cardiovascular disease; PSA, prostate specific antigen Implementation Strategy Patients who request testing should be informed about the risks and benefits of tests for prostate cancer, and should be assisted to make their own decision using an acceptable decision aid.16 9.2 risk High risk 10 years prior to age of onset of affected family member Biennial faecal occult blood test (FOBT) can reduce colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality by 16%.17 The original trials of FOBT screening used the guaiac-based FOBT , but this has been superseded by the more sensitive and specific faecal immunochemical test (ie iFOBT). Organised screening by iFOBT is recommended for the asymptomatic (average risk) population from 50 years of age every two years (A) until 74 years of age with repeated negative findings.18,19 In November 2017, the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) endorsed a new national guideline on CRC prevention and screening. Screening recommendations, which used to be determined solely on lifetime risk of CRC, now also account for absolute risk of cancer in the short term.109 Risk assessment should include determining the number and type of relatives affected by CRC, and age at diagnosis (refer to Table 9.2.1. Colorectal cancer: Identifying risk). The new guideline also changed the recommendations on CRC screening modality in people at moderate risk of CRC. Of note, iFOBT is now recommended for people in this group from 40 to 49 years of age 106 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition and colonoscopy five-yearly from 50 to 74 years of age. Digital rectal examination (DRE) is not recommended as a screening tool (D), but is important in evaluating patients who present with symptoms (eg rectal bleeding). Colonoscopy is not recommended as a screening test for people at average risk of CRC. No randomised controlled trial (RCT) has evaluated the effect of colonoscopy on CRC mortality, although trials are in progress in Spain, Sweden and the US. Colonoscopy has indirect and direct harms, including, rarely, death from the procedure (one in 10,000-14,000 colonoscopies).20,21 Harm may be caused by the bowel cleanout prior to the procedure ( eg dehydration, electrolyte imbalances), sedation used during the procedure (eg cardiovascular events), or the procedure itself (eg infection, colonic perforations, bleeding). There is insufficient evidence about the use of computed tomography (CT) colonography (also refer to Chapter 15. Screening tests of unproven benefit), faecal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or plasma circulating DNA tests to recommend them as alternatives to iFOBT for CRC screening.22 The 2017 NHMRC-endorsed guideline also examined an updated systematic review of trial evidence on the effects of low-dose aspirin on CRC incidence and mortality. The guideline development group considered evidence relating to the additional benefits from reduction in cardiovascular disease risk and potential adverse effects (ie haemorrhagic stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding, peptic ulcer).109 Overall, it was found that the benefits of taking low-dose aspirin outweighed the harms, and the guideline recommends that aspirin should be actively considered in all people aged 50-74 years.

The individual should take into account the potential risks of taking aspirin. Aspirin should be avoided in patients with current dyspepsia, any history of peptic ulcer, aspirin allergy, bleeding diathesis, an increased risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage (eg associated with use of oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents), or renal impairment. The benefit may extend to older ages with longer duration of use. The benefit for cancer prevention (though shorter for cardiovascular risk) is evident only after 10 years of initiation, so a life expectancy of at least 10 years should be taken into consideration in the advice to use aspirin. Approximately 5% of all CRCs and 10-15% of CRCs diagnosed in people aged <50 years are caused by high-risk germline mutations. Genetic knowledge is rapidly expanding and new discoveries are likely to explain cases of heritable predisposition for which a mutation cannot currently be identified. Genetic testing for familial cancer syndromes is undergoing rapid change as technology improves and costs for more extensive testing strategies drop. Testing strategies are moving towards testing a panel of genes covering all polyposis conditions, or a non-polyposis Lynch panel, or both where the phenotype is unclear. \u00a7Lynch syndrome-related cancers include endometrial, ovarian, gastric, pancreatic, urothelial, adenomas and keratoacanthomas. ||Aspirin at 600 mg/day reduced syndrome cancer incidence by 50-68% in the Colorectal Adenoma/Carcinoma Prevention Programme 2 (CAPP2) randomised controlled trials (RCTs)28,29 suggests low-dose aspirin (100 mg/day) also reduces cancer incidence by half. A dose-response RCT in Lynch syndrome is open for recruitment at www.capp3.org #There are several rare polyposis syndromes, some of which are associated with other cancers (eg familial adenomatous polyposis is associated with duodenal, Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Patients who have adenomatous polyps removed at colonoscopy are then classified as having above-average risk for the development of metachronous adenomatous polyps and CRC. Table 9.2.2 provides advice about colonoscopic surveillance and recommended frequency based on the number and histology of polyps. It is important to try to obtain information about the histology, size and number of polyps removed, as this determines the future risk of adenomas and CRC and, therefore, frequency of recommended surveillance colonoscopy.30 Table 9.2.2. Follow-up after polypectomy Polyp type colonoscopy interval Small, pale, distal hyperplastic polyps only (not adenomas) No follow-up required as no increased risk of metachronous colorectal neoplasia One to two small tubular (<10 mm) adenomas Repeat colonoscopy at five years If that colonoscopy is normal, repeat colonoscopy at 10 years or immunochemical faecal occult blood test (iFOBT) every two years High-risk adenomas (three or more adenomas, 10 mm, or with tubulovillous or villous histology, or high-grade dysplasia)Three-year intervals Large and sessile adenomas removed piecemeal Three to six months and again at 12 months to ensure complete removal Multiple adenomas, which is a strong determinant of risk of metachronous advanced and non-advanced neoplasia: 5 adenomas12 months Multiple adenomas, which is a strong determinant of risk of metachronous advanced and non-advanced neoplasia: 10 adenomasSooner than 12 months (because of the likelihood of missed synchronous polyps) Family history in addition to adenomas Intervals determined by adenoma characteristics, unless a syndromic risk mandates more frequent surveillance If advanced adenomas are found during subsequent surveillanceThree-yearly schedule is prudent, but the choice should be individualised; interval can be lengthened if advanced adenomas are not found People aged 75 years No surveillance as lead time for progression of an adenoma to cancer is approximately 10-20 years iFOBT, immunochemical faecal occult blood test Table 9.2.3. to detect colorectal cancer Test Technique References Faecal occult blood test (FOBT) screeningTwo main faecal immunochemical test (iFOBT) iFOBTs are preferred as they have greater sensitivity and higher uptake (A).31 Two or three serial stools should be tested, depending on the type and brand of test being used. Follow the manufacturer's instructions It is essential that any positive iFOBT (including just one of the samples) is appropriately investigated by colonoscopy (such people being at least 12 times more likely to have colorectal cancer [CRC] than those with a negative test). With guaiac tests, even if a subject fails to follow dietary restrictions, it is dangerous to assume that a positive result is a result of dietary non-compliance31, Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Implementation Strategy Measures to increase screening in these groups include organised approaches such as employing recall and reminder systems;32,33 recommendations by the GP for the screening;33,34 addressing capacity issues, including convenience;33,35 and minimising barriers such as cost.33,35,36 Refer to the RACGP's Putting prevention into practice: Guidelines for the implementation of prevention in the general practice setting (Green Book) . The National Bowel Cancer Screening Program, using iFOBT, is being expanded, and by 2020 will offer biennial screening for people aged 50-74 years. GPs are critical, not just in maximising participation but in managing participants with a positive iFOBT.34,37 Participation is under-represented by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) peoples.38 age is a major risk factor for developing breast cancer. Other major risk factors include a personal history of atypical hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ, a strong family history of the disease or mutation in a breast cancer predisposition gene, and previous radiotherapy (eg for previous cancer). Breast cancer risk factors that reflect hormonal exposures in the distant past, such as age at menarche or age at first birth, are less predictive of late-life breast cancer than factors indicating recent hormonal exposures such as high bone mass or obesity (refer to https://canceraustralia.gov.au/clinical-best-practice/breast-cancer/breast-cancer-risk for further information). Breast cancer risk is not normally distributed: most women have a low (<4%) lifetime risk; and the remainder 4% to more than 80%.39,40 Prevention of breast cancer Physical activity,41 adequate folate,42 a Mediterranean diet,43 normal BMI (in postmenopausal women only) and decreased alcohol consumption44 are associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer in observational studies. For women at moderate (ie 1.5-3 times the population risk) or high (ie >3 times the population risk) risk, additional interventions such as risk-reducing medication45 (moderate and high risk) and risk-reducing surgery46 (high risk) are available. Referral to specialist genetic assessment is available for women assessed at high risk. Screening The screening strategy employed for an individual woman depends on her individual degree of risk. Validated tools are available that can assess an individual woman's breast cancer risk (eg International Breast Cancer Intervention Study [IBIS] tool, available at www.ems-trials.org/riskevaluator ).47 For asymptomatic, low-risk women, BreastScreen Australia recommends screening mammograms every two years for women aged 50-74 years (B).48 The benefits of screening are obvious. However, the risks must not be forgotten: assuming that screening reduces breast cancer mortality by 15%, and that overdiagnosis and overtreatment is at 30%, then for every 2000 women invited for screening over 10 years, one will avoid dying of breast cancer and 10 healthy women, who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening, will be treated unnecessarily.49,50 An extra 200 women will experience important psychological distress including anxiety and uncertainty from false positive findings. The substantial advances in treatment, and greater breast cancer awareness since the trials were carried out, mean that presented breast cancers are detected earlier and survive better, so screening today is less effective than at 110 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition the time of the trials. Recent observational studies show more overdiagnosis than in the trials and very little or no reduction in the incidence of advanced cancers with screening.51 The decision to start screening mammogram should be an individual one. This is especially for women aged <50 years, where the benefits-harms ratio is less favourable.48 Some points: Screening mammogram in women aged 40-49 years may reduce the risk of dying of breast cancer, but the number of deaths averted is much smaller than in older women, and the number of false-positive tests and unnecessary biopsies are larger (C). Some women put a higher value on the potential benefit than the potential harms, and may choose to begin screening between the ages of 40-49 years (C).48 For women at average risk (ie <1.5 times population risk) of breast cancer, most of the benefit of a mammogram will result from biennial screening during ages 50-74 years of age.48 Of all age groups, women aged 60-69 years are most likely to avoid a breast cancer death through mammogram screening (C).48 All women undergoing regular screening mammogram are at risk of overdiagnosis - the detection (and then treatment) of non-invasive and invasive breast cancer that would otherwise not have become a threat to their health, or even apparent, during her lifetime (C).48 Women with a parent, sibling, or child with breast cancer may benefit more than average-risk women from beginning screening between 40 and 49 years of age (C).48 Cancer Australia recommends considering annual mammograms from 40 years of age if the woman has a first- degree relative <50 years of age diagnosed with breast cancer (refer to Table 9.3.1).48 There is insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammogram in women aged >75 years (I).48 Randomised trials of the benefits of screening mammogram did not include women >74 years of age. However observational studies favour extending screening mammogram to older women who have a life expectancy of not less than 10 years.52 There is insufficient evidence to recommend that clinical breast examination offers any benefits to women, of any age (C).48 However, it is recommended that all women, whether or not they undergo mammogram screening, are aware of how their breasts normally look and feel, and promptly report any new or unusual changes (such as a lump, nipple changes, nipple discharge, change in skin colour, pain in a breast) to their GP . No one method for women to use when checking their breasts is recommended over another. The recommended screening strategy for women at different individual degrees of risk is outlined in Table 9.3.1. Cancer Australia recommends that women at any age at increased risk (ie >1.5 times population risk) are offered an individualised surveillance program by their GP and/or specialist.53 This might include regular clinical breast examination and breast imaging with mammography and/or ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). There is government funding available for MRI screening for women <50 years of age at high risk of developing breast cancer.54111 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Table 9.3.1.

Everyone, particularly children, should be advised to adopt protective measures when ultraviolet (UV) levels are 3. An RCT in Queensland showed that sunscreen applied daily reduces the incidence of melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in adults with a previous history of skin cancer.58,59 Screening of asymptomatic (low-risk) people for melanoma or non-melanocytic skin cancer (NMSC) is not recommended as there is insufficient evidence available to show that this reduces death.60 A skin cancer screening program in one region of Germany reported temporary reductions in melanoma mortality; however, this ecological study may be subject to several biases.61,62 Instead of screening, providing education that raises awareness of the early signs of skin cancer, particularly in people aged >40 years is recommended. Patients can be assessed opportunistically, or when concerned generally, or about a specific skin lesion. 9.4.1 sun protection and prevention Screen increased-risk and high-risk patients Clinical assessment of future risk of melanoma should take into account:60 patient's age and sex history of previous melanoma or NMSC number of naevi (common and atypical) family history of melanoma skin and hair pigmentation response to sun exposure evidence of actinic skin damage.

Characteristics of suspicious naevi include asymmetry, border irregularity, variable colour (including a surrounding coloured halo) and diameter >6 mm (mnemonic 'ABCD'). Naevi that stand out from the others ('ugly duckling') are also suspicious. Nodular melanomas (with a much worse prognosis) are characteristically elevated, firm, growing over the past month (mnemonic 'EFG') The 7-point checklist is an alternative method to assess pigmented skin lesions and is the only one to have been validated and shown to improve the identification of melanoma in primary care.

Skin self-examination should be encouraged for high-risk individuals (B). The most common preventable cause of NMSC is UV exposure. All people, especially children, should be advised to use protective measures when UV levels are 3 (A). An RCT in Queensland showed that sunscreen applied daily reduces the incidence of melanoma and SCC in adults with a previous history of skin cancer.58 In northern Australia and some parts of southern Australia, UV exposure is sufficiently high to require daily use of sunscreen.

They are adjustable to specific geographic locations around Australia, and is available at www.sunsmart.com.au60, 67 Skin examinationPrecede skin examination by enquiring for relevant history (eg of lesions of concern to patient or recent appearance or change in any lesions in the past few months or years). Examination should identify skin lumps, ulcers or scaly patches, particularly growing, scarred or inflamed lesions. Consider incision, shave or excision biopsy for histology (or referral). There are many suitable means to treat non-melanocytic skin cancer (NMSC); these include surgery, cryotherapy, curettage and cytotoxic and immune modulating creams Training in the use of dermoscopy can assist in diagnosis70, 75 Self- examinationAdvise patients to be alert for skin lesion changes 79 NMSC, non-melanocytic skin cancer; SPF, sun protection vaccination (B) For maximal effect, the vaccination should be given prior to the onset of sexual activity. It has no modifying effect on already acquired human papillomavirus (HPV) infections. It is available as part of the National Immunisation Program Schedule for girls and boys in year 7.81,82 HPV-vaccinated women still require cervical screening as the HPV vaccine does not protect against all the types of HPV that cause cervical cancer .118 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Screening Australia has the lowest mortality rate and the second lowest incidence of cervical cancer in the world. The success of the cervical screening program is dependent upon the recruitment of women: 85% of women in Australia who develop cervical cancer have either not had a Papanicolaou (Pap) test or been inadequately screened in the past 10 years. Women aged >50 years are still under-screened.83 Australia's National Cervical Cancer Screening Program will change from May 2017. As of that date, women aged 25-74 years, both HPV vaccinated and unvaccinated, will be invited to undertake an HPV test every five years.84 Women of any age who have symptoms (including pain or bleeding) should have appropriate clinical assessment, which may include a cervical cytology test and an HPV test. Women between 70 and 74 years of age who have had a regular screening test will be recommended to have an exit HPV test before leaving the cervical screening program. A comparison between the current program and the one starting in May 2017 is given in Box A. In the interim, the National Cervical Cancer Screening program continues to recommend Pap test screening every two years for women who have ever had sex and have an intact cervix, commencing from 18-20 years of age (or up to two years after first having sexual intercourse, whichever is later).85 Box A.

Women aged >70 years who have never had a Pap test, or who request a Pap test, should be screened Women with female sex partners are also at risk of developing cervical cancer and should be screened as above85 Increased risk: Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types is necessary for the development of cervical cancer. Other risk factors include: -immunosuppression -cigarette smoking -use of combined oral contraception >5 yearsPap test (Practice Point)It is important to ensure the patient always receives the results of her test Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL): A woman with a Pap test report of possible/definite LSIL should have a repeat Pap test in 12 months (Practice Point). If the repeat test at 12 months shows LSIL (definite or possible) the woman should be referred for colposcopy A woman aged 30 years with a Pap test report of LSIL, without a history of negative smears in the preceding two to three years, should be offered either colposcopy or a repeat Pap test at six months (Practice Point) High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL): Refer for colposcopy where indicated Glandular abnormality or adenocarcinoma: Refer for colposcopy by an experienced gynaecologist or gynaecological oncologist If the woman is symptomatic or if she has a clinically abnormal cervix, referral for colposcopy is preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Table 9.5.2. Tests to detect cervical cancer risk Test Technique References Papanicolaou (Pap) testA sample of the ectocervix (using an extended tip spatula) then the endocervix (using a cytobrush), provides the best method of sampling and can be used in all age groups of women (the cytobrush is not recommended for use during pregnancy) The cervical broom can be used on its own in premenopausal women if it is possible to sample from both sides of the transformation zone. In postmenopausal women, the transformation zone tends to be higher in the endocervical canal The cervical cells should be placed onto a glass slide and fixed with spray within five seconds. If the smear is reported as technically unsatisfactory, it should not be repeated before six weeks In postmenopausal women with atrophic changes, it may be necessary to use vaginal oestrogen for 14-21 days prior to the test. Refer to Chapter 15. Screening tests of unproven benefit regarding evidence related to bimanual vaginal examination88 Human papillomavirus (HPV) testingAs a primary screening tool: Current national guidelines do not support the use of HPV testing as a primary screening tool. This will change from May 2017 In triage of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL): The use of HPV testing in the triage of LSIL remains under investigation and is not currently recommended by the National Cervical Cancer Screening guidelines In follow-up of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion HSIL, cervical cytology plus HPV testing should be performed 12 months post-treatment and annually thereafter until both tests are negative on two consecutive occasions, at which point women can return to the routine cervical screening interval85, 89, 90 85, 91-93 Liquid-based cytologyLiquid-based cytology can be used as an additional test to the conventional smear, but not as a substitute. Its addition may be useful when repeating an unsatisfactory smear, or added if requested by the woman94, 95 Self-collection If patients do not agree to undergo Pap (or HPV) testing by a clinician, they can be assisted to collect the sample provide helpful advice: Recommended screening tests and the visual appearance of the cervix, www.papscreen.org.au/downloads/ resources/other/cervical_sampling_card.pdf HPV: A guide for practitioners, www.papscreen.org.au/downloads/resources/other/hpv-a-guide-for- practitioners.pdf Pelvic examination Screening pelvic examinations for the detection of pathology in asymptomatic, non-pregnant, adult women is not recommended because there is no evidence of benefit.98 Also refer to Chapter 15. Screening tests of unproven benefit. Implementation Strategy Methods of encouraging women to undergo cervical screening include invitations, reminders, education, message framing, counselling, risk-factor assessment, procedures and economic interventions. Evidence supports the use of invitations and, to a lesser extent, educational materials. It is likely other methods are advantageous, but the evidence is not as strong. Further research is required.97121 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition 9.6 Ovarian cancer a preventive activity Screening in asymptomatic, low-risk women is not recommended. Screening methods for ovarian cancer employ blood tests for cancer antigen (CA) 125, or transabdominal or transvaginal ultrasound. There are three large randomised trials on ovarian cancer screening: the United States Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian trial (PLCO), which reported in 2011;99 the United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) in late 2015;100 and a European trial, which commenced in 2005 and has not reported yet. The UK trial found a small reduction in ovarian deaths from CA125, and transvaginal ultrasound for routine population-based screening for ovarian cancer. However, the results are regarded as preliminary, requiring confirmation and longer follow-up100 and, in the meantime, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against ovarian cancer screening.101 Table 9.6.1. Ovarian cancer: Identifying risk Who is at risk? What should be done? How often? References Lower risk: Those who have used the oral contraception or carried a pregnancy to term (risk of about half the population average)No screening 102 Higher risk: Family history of ovarian cancer, especially first-degree relatives and more than one relative (risk of about 3 times the population average) Presence of the genes BRCA1 or BRCA2No screening Consider increased frequency of screening for breast and colorectal cancer (CRC)103 104 CRC, recommended as a preventive activity There is insufficient evidence to routinely screen for testicular cancer using clinical or self-examination.105,106 Those performing testicular self-examination are not more likely to detect early-stage tumours or have better survival than those who do not (C).

Psychosocial General practitioners (GPs) play an important role in the detection and management of mental illness, especially with prevalent conditions such as depression and anxiety, and social conditions such as intimate partner violence.1 The prevalence of gender-based violence has been estimated at 27.4%.2 In the most recent (2007) Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing, the prevalence of any lifetime mental disorder was 45.5%, with a 12-month prevalence of 14.4% for anxiety disorders, 6.2% for affective disorders and 5.1% for substance use disorders.3 Patients, especially women, who experience underlying intimate partner violence, often present with depression and anxiety.4 Health inequity What are the key equity issues and who is at risk? Socioeconomic disadvantage - The National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing identified that 'the proportion of people who reported having mental problems increased as levels of socioeconomic disadvantage increased'. In 2007-08, 16% of people living in the most disadvantaged areas had a mental or behavioural problem, compared with 11% of people living in the least disadvantaged areas.3 The likelihood of depression among low socioeconomic status (SES) persons is almost double that of high SES persons (most marked for persistent depression).3,5-7 Anxiety and affective disorders are more common in unemployed people.8,9 In patients with chronic disease and disability, lower educational level and unemployment are predictive of depression.10,11 -Practices in disadvantaged areas have a higher prevalence of depression to identify and manage. Mental health services overall are used at lower rates by the socioeconomically disadvantaged, possibly related to low health literacy and stigma.12-14 -Suicide and attempted suicide are consistently associated with markers of SES disadvantage including limited educational achievement and homelessness.15,16 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples - Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are known to be at greater risk of morbidity and mortality from mental health-related conditions affecting social and emotional wellbeing. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are hospitalised for mental health problems at twice the rate of non-Indigenous Australians and experience twice the rate of suicide, rising to five times the rate in the 15-19 years age group.17 Very high psychological distress in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities may be related to the risk factors of chronic stress and exposure to violence, racism (including within the health system18 where all concerned have a role to ensure this does not happen), and marginalisation and dispossession.19 Culturally and linguistically diverse patients (CALD) - Differences in the way depression is understood and presented may create barriers to accessing effective depression care for patients from non-English-speaking and culturally diverse backgrounds.20 Age - Income-related inequalities in the prevalence of psychological distress and common mental health conditions are particularly common in midlife.21 With advancing age, socioeconomic inequities lead to an increase in anxiety and depression. Young people with a low level of education have the greatest likelihood of experiencing chronic depression and progression from anxiety to depression. Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with both the incidence and chronic nature of depression and anxiety symptoms in older adults.22 Childbirth - Postpartum depression and poor childbirth outcomes are associated with socioeconomic disadvantage.23 Postpartum depression is more common in women from CALD backgrounds and these women are less likely to receive help.24 Immigrant women experience many barriers to accessing high-quality, equitable care and are especially vulnerable to stress in the postpartum period, which may result in postnatal depression.25,26127 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition What can GPs do? Refer to the general principles of providing patient education and supporting health literacy in disadvantaged groups (refer to preamble). Be aware of the associated stigma of mental illness if offering opportunistic screening for depression to disadvantaged groups. Refer to The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners' (RACGP) National guide to a preventive health assessment for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people for important information on offering mental health care to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients.27 Assist women to achieve optimal postpartum health by linking them into social and medical supports, improving their health literacy and self-efficacy, and promoting positive coping strategies and realistic expectations.28 Early screening and treatment of women with perinatal mental illness can alleviate symptoms and decrease comorbid disease risk.29 Culturally appropriate, individual-level interventions may is evidence that depression screening instruments have reasonable sensitivity and specificity, the evidence for improved health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of screening for depression in primary care remains unclear. There is evidence for routine screening for depression in the general adult population in the context of staff-assisted support to the GP in providing depression care, case management and coordination (eg via practice nurses; B).31 There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening in adults or adolescents where case management and coordination is not available (C).31 There is insufficient evidence to recommend screening in children.32 Clinicians should maintain a high level of awareness for depressive symptoms in patients at high risk of depression and make appropriate clinical assessments wherever the risk is high.33 Table 10.1.1. Depression: Identifying risk Who is at risk? What should be done? How often? References Average risk: Adult population aged 18 years, where no risk factors for depression are identifiedBe alert to possible depression, but do not routinely screen unless staff- assisted depression care supports are in place (C)Opportunistically 31 Increased risk: Past history of depression Family history of depression Other psychiatric disorders, including substance misuse Chronic medical conditions Unemployment Low socioeconomic status (SES) Older adults with significant life events (eg illness, cognitive decline, bereavement or institutional placement) All family members who have experienced family violence Lesbian, gay and bisexual peoples Experience of child abuseRecurrent screening may be more useful in people deemed to be at higher risk of depression (B); however, in the case of people with chronic diseases (eg diabetes, heart failure, coronary heart disease), a screen-and-treat strategy for depression has not been shown to improve chronic disease symptoms nor reduce health service use Maintain a high level of clinical awareness of those at high risk of depression and consider depression when a person presents with suggestive symptoms such as low mood, insomnia, anhedonia, suicidal thoughtsOpportunistically 31 33 34 35 36128 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Who is at risk? What should be done? How often? References Increased risk Pregnant and postpartum women Risk factors for depression during pregnancy and postpartum include poor self-esteem, child care stress, prenatal anxiety, life stress, decreased social support, single/ unpartnered relationship status, history of depression, difficult infant temperament, previous postpartum depression, lower SES, and unintended pregnancyRecurrent screening may be more useful in people deemed to be at higher risk of depression (B)Opportunistically 31 Adolescents aged 12-18 years, particularly with: -family history of depression -deliberate self-harm -comorbid mental health or chronic medical conditions -experience of a major negative life event (including being bullied)The benefits of screening alone have not been established, but screening is recommended where access to effective treatment and follow up is available Be alert for signs of depression in this age group (B) Consider use of HE2ADS3 assessment tool (refer to Practice Point m in Table 3.2)At every encounter 32, 37-39 40, 41 SES, socioeconomic status Table 10.1.2. Test to detect depression Test Technique References Question regarding mood and anhedoniaAsking two simple questions may be as effective as longer instruments: 'Over the past two weeks, have you felt down, depressed or hopeless?' 'Over the past two weeks, have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things?' Asking a patient if help is needed in addition to these two screening questions improves the specificity of a GP diagnosis of depression (IV) In adolescents, consider use of HE2ADS3 assessment tool (refer to Chapter 3. Preventive activities in children and young people) In women in the perinatal period, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) can be used to detect women requiring further assessment of possible major depression (B in the postnatal period) at www.blackdoginstitute.org.au/docs/ CliniciansdownloadableEdinburgh.pdf or www.beyondblue.org.au/who-does-it-affect/ pregnancy-and-early-parenthood/edinburgh-postnatal-depression-scale Refer to Section 10.3. Identification of intimate partner violence , as depression is a common reason for presentation in those experiencing violence42 33 43 EPDS, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale129 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition 10.2 Suicide There is a lack of evidence for the routine screening of patients using a screening instrument (C). GPs should be alert for higher-risk individuals and the possibility of suicide in these patients. There is evidence that detecting and treating depression has a role in suicide prevention.44,45 For example, the incidence of suicide has decreased in older men and women in association with exposure to antidepressants.31,46 Table 10.2.1. Suicide: Identifying risk Who is at risk?What should be done? How often?

Tests to detect suicide risk Test Technique References Evaluate the risk of suicide in the presence of risk factorsAssessment of risk involves enquiring into the extent of the person's suicidal thinking and intent, including the following: Suicidal thinking - If suicidal thinking is present, how frequent and persistent is it? Plan - If the person has a plan, how detailed and realistic is it? Lethality - What method has the person chosen and how lethal is it? Means - Does the person have the means to carry out the method? Past history - Has the person ever planned or attempted suicide? Suicide of family member or peer - Has someone close to the person attempted or completed suicide? Consideration should also be given to: risk and protective factors mental state - hopelessness, despair, psychosis, agitation, shame, anger, guilt, impulsivity substance use - current misuse of alcohol or other drugs strengths and supports - availability, willingness and capacity of supports For all patients with suicidal ideation, enquiry should be made regarding preparatory actions (eg obtaining a weapon, making a plan, putting affairs in order, giving away prized possessions, preparing a suicide note)41 Screening for psychological distress in young peopleThe HE2ADS3 tool has questions that can assist in assessing suicide risk. For example: Sometimes when people feel really down, they feel like hurting or even killing themselves. Have you ever felt that way? Have you ever deliberately harmed or injured yourself (eg cutting, burning or putting yourself in unsafe situations, such as unsafe sex)? Do you feel sad or down more than usual? How long have you felt that way? Have you lost interest in things you usually like? On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being the worst you feel and 10 being really great and positive, how would you rate your mood today?40 10.3 Intimate partner use healthcare services more than non-abused women. They also identify healthcare providers as the professionals they would most trust with disclosure of abuse.52 Consider asking all pregnant adult and adolescent women about partner violence during antenatal care.1 There is insufficient evidence for screening the general population;53 however, there should be a low threshold for asking about abuse, particularly when the GP suspects underlying psychosocial problems.1 Training GPs to identify violence has resulted in increased identification and referral to services.54 Inviting women who are fearful of a partner to attend counselling by trained GPs has resulted in increased safety discussions with women and less depressive symptoms.55 There is some evidence for the effectiveness of interventions in clinical practice to reduce partner violence.56131 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Table 10.3.1. Intimate partner violence: Identifying risk Who is at risk? What should be done? How often?

Tests to detect intimate partner violence Test Technique References Ask about partner violenceVictimised women stress the importance of a trusting doctor-patient relationship, confidentiality, and respectful and non-judgemental attitudes to achieving disclosure, as well as acceptance of non-disclosure and a supportive response. It is crucial for safety reasons that any questions are asked privately, when the patient is alone - not when another family member, adult or child >2 years of age is present. It is a clinician's responsibility to ask and support women regardless of their response. Asking about abuse may 'plant a seed' for later action The World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines recommend that GPs should ask women who are 'symptomatic' (eg show symptoms of mental ill health, chronic unexplained physical symptoms, unexplained injuries, frequent attendance) about partner violence Questions and statements to make if you suspect domestic violence: Has your partner ever physically threatened or hurt you? Is there a lot of tension in your relationship? How do you resolve arguments? Sometimes partners react strongly in arguments and use physical force. Is this happening to you? Are you afraid of your partner? Violence is very common in the home. I ask a lot of my patients about abuse because nobody should have to live in fear of their partners52 1 WHO, World Health Organization These recommendations might apply to people in same-sex relationships and male victims, but there has been insufficient research in these areas.132 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition References 1.

Significant financial barriers to accessing dental care remain in Australia. People on low incomes are more likely to delay dental visits and less likely to receive appropriate dental care.18 Private dental insurance is associated with higher rates of dental care, but insurance is less common in low income groups or those in regional or remote locations. People who hold healthcare cards are less likely to receive preventive dental care and more likely to receive extractions when visiting the dentist.18,19 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are at higher risk of poor oral health.20136 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition References 1.

Evidence supports screening people at higher risk for glaucoma (A). General practitioners (GPs) have an important role in identifying those at increased risk for glaucoma and referring them for testing. There is no consensus on the recommended frequency of screening for at-risk groups.1,2 Table 12.1. Glaucoma: Identifying risk Who is at risk? What should be done? How often?

Canberra: NHMRC, 2010.138 Guidelines for preventive activities in general evidence for screening general population There is no evidence for screening for urinary incontinence in the general population. Instead, GPs should case-find those at higher risk (B). Within the general population, up to 19% of children,1 13% of men and 37% of women may be affected by some form of urinary incontinence.2 While urinary incontinence is most common in women and increases with age, bedwetting (enuresis) is common in children (5.5% of children also report daytime wetting).1 In men, uncomplicated lower urinary tract symptoms do not appear to be associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer.3 Of those sitting in a GP waiting room, 65% of women and 30% of men report some type of urinary incontinence, yet only 31% of these people report having sought help from a health professional.4 Primary care professionals are in a position to take a more proactive approach to incontinence treatment by asking about urinary symptoms in at-risk groups during routine appointments. There remains considerable health decrement due to urinary incontinence in those not receiving help in a population readily accessible to primary care services.5 Table 13.1. Urinary incontinence: Identifying risk Who is at higher risk of urinary incontinence? What should be done? How often? References Average risk: There is no evidence to support screening (IV)N/A Higher risk: Prenatal and postnatal women Women who have had children Women who are overweight Women reporting constipation People with respiratory conditions, diabetes stroke, heart conditions, recent surgery, neurological disorders Frail elderly people or long-term care residentsCase finding (IV, B) Ask about the occurrence of urinary incontinence In residential aged care facilities, residents are automatically assessedEvery 12 months2 Table 13.2.

Simple patient survey assessment tools have been shown to be valid and reliable (A)6139 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Intervention Technique References Assessment Patients with urinary incontinence should be assessed to determine the diagnostic category as well as underlying aetiology. This can usually be determined on the basis of history, physical examination, and urinary dipstick and culture, if indicated. A post-void residual may be required in the assessment of possible retention and/or overflow There are four common types of incontinence: 1. Stress incontinence is the leaking of urine that may occur during exercise, coughing, sneezing, laughing, walking, lifting or playing sport. This is more common in women, although it also occurs in men, especially after prostate surgery. Pregnancy, childbirth and menopause are the main contributors 2. Urge incontinence is a sudden and strong need to urinate. It is often associated with frequency and nocturia, and is often due to having an over-active or unstable bladder, neurological condition, constipation, enlarged prostate or history of poor bladder habits 3. Mixed incontinence is a combination of stress and urge incontinence, and is most common in older women 4. Overflow incontinence as a result of bladder outflow obstruction or injury. Its symptoms may be confused with stress incontinence Because treatments differ, urge incontinence should be distinguished from stress incontinence (A) To make this distinction, the International Continence Society guidelines recommend an extensive evaluation that is too time-consuming for primary care practice However, the 3 Incontinence Questions (3IQ) questionnaire is a simple, quick, and non-invasive test with acceptable accuracy for classifying urge and stress incontinence, and may be appropriate for use in primary care settings (A). The questionnaire is provided in Appendix 13A7 8, 9 The Continence Foundation of Australia (CFA) has a helpline available for consumers and healthcare professionals at 1800 33 00 66.

Osteoporosis Men The goal of the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis is to reduce a person's overall fracture risk, not just to maintain bone density. Review of fracture risk factors for postmenopausal women aged >45 years and men aged >50 years is recommended (Practice Point). Those with increased risk should have bone density assessed (Practice Point). Osteoporosis is a disease characterised by low bone mass and micro-architectural deterioration of bone tissue, leading to bone fragility and increased fracture risk.1 It is diagnosed on the presence of a fragility fracture (fracture from the equivalent of a fall from standing height or less, or a fracture that under normal circumstances would not be expected in a healthy young man or woman). For epidemiological and clinical purposes, osteoporosis is defined by bone mineral density (BMD) as a T-score of -2.5. However, age, lifestyle factors, family history, and some medications and diseases contribute to bone loss and increased risk of fragility fractures. Furthermore, it is important to note that in an individual who has sustained a fragility fracture, a T-score of -2.5 is not also required to make the diagnosis of osteoporosis, the presence of a fragile fracture is sufficient. Thus, the goal of prevention and treatment is to reduce a person's overall fracture risk (not just maintain bone density). Two of the most widely validated methods to estimate absolute fracture risk for osteoporotic fractures relevant to the Australian population are available at: www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX www.garvan.org.au/promotions/bone-fracture-risk/calculator These calculators can be used with and without measuring BMD, though the Garvan fracture risk calculator has not been validated in an external cohort when BMD has not been used in the calculator.2 Risk estimation is imperfect, with the tools being modest predictors of fracture risk.3,4 Risk factors (eg falls, glucocorticoid use) not included in one or the other risk algorithm require clinical judgement to modify the risk estimate. To date, there are no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) directly evaluating screening effectiveness, harms and intervals, and whether screening is performed by bone density screening by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) or by estimating absolute fracture risk.4 The place of absolute fracture risk assessment in the prevention and management of osteoporosis requires further clarification as its effectiveness is yet to be tested.142 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Table 14.1. Osteoporosis: Identifying risk Who is at risk? What should be done? How often? References Average risk: Postmenopausal women (aged 45 years) Men aged 50 yearsClinical assessment for risk factors (Practice Point) Preventive advice (II, C)Every 12 months (Practice Point)1, 3, 5 Increased risk: Aged >60 years for men and >50 years for women plus any of: -family history of fragility fracture -smoking -high alcohol intake (>4 standard drinks per day for men and >2 for women) -vitamin D deficiency <50 nmol (screening for vitamin D not indicated just for risk assessment)* -low body weight (body mass index [BMI] <20kg/m2) -recurrent falls -low levels of physical activity -immobility (to the extent that person cannot leave their home or cannot do any housework) Medical conditions and medications that may cause secondary osteoporosis including: -endocrine disorders amenorrhea for >12 months (unrelated to pregnancy) before 45 years of age -inflammatory conditions (eg rheumatoid arthritis) -malabsorption gammopathies -human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and treatment -Type and type 2 diabetes mellitus -drugs, especially corticosteroids (eg 7.5 mg for >3 months) used for immunosuppression including as part of chronic anti-rejection therapy in organ or bone marrow transplant, anti-epileptic, aromatase inhibitors, anti-androgen, excessive X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to measure bone mineral density (BMD) and management of risk factors (II, A to III, D depending on risk factor) Investigate for causes of secondary osteoporosis if indicated by history, examination findings or BMD result (Practice Point)The optimal timing of repeated DXA for screening is unknown but is likely to vary depending on baseline BMD Women with baseline T-score >-1.0 may take longer than 15 years to transition to osteoporosis Repeat only when it is likely to change management (II, C) Where there is a specific condition or medication present likely to lead to accelerated bone loss (eg corticosteroid use [refer to causes of secondary osteoporosis]), consider more frequent repeat of DXA (Practice Point)3, 5-8143 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Who is at risk? What should be done? How often? References High risk of further fracture: Patients aged >45 years who have sustained a low-trauma fracture Postmenopausal women, and older men with a vertebral fracture. Such fractures should be ruled out if clinically suspected (eg from loss of height >3 cm, kyphosis, back pain)DXA to measure BMD and management of risk factors (II, A) Investigate for causes of secondary osteoporosis if indicated by history, examination findings or BMD result (Practice Point) Recommend that such individuals are initiated on effective anti-osteoporosis therapy unless there are specific contraindicationsDXA at presentation and no more than every two years (II, B). It is appropriate to recommend a repeat BMD by DXA after two years for patients at risk of developing osteoporosis, to assist in re-evaluation of fracture risk In patients with confirmed osteoporosis, repeat BMD is generally not required; however, it may be conducted before initiating a change in, or cessation of, anti-osteoporotic therapy (Practice Point) Where there is a specific condition or medication present likely to lead to accelerated bone loss (eg corticosteroid use [refer to causes of secondary osteoporosis]), consider more frequent repeat of DXA (Practice Point)1 *Assessment of the potential clinical importance of a given serum vitamin D level should take into consideration the season in which the test was done, as levels in an individual will be higher from late spring to autumn than in winter to early spring6,9 (Practice Point) There is no accepted cut-off or standard definition for defining low levels of physical activity as a risk factor for osteoporosis. Those at risk would include people with higher levels of sedentary behaviour, (eg those who participate in no recreational exercise,10 or who are sitting and lying for more than 20 hours per day).11 It also includes those who perform relatively low levels of weight bearing physical activity (eg people who walk less than 60 minutes per day,11 less than 12 km per week,12 or do not walk for exercise)10 BMD, bone mineral density; BMI, body serotonin reuptake inhibitor144 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Table 14.2. Osteoporosis: Preventive interventions Intervention Technique References Assessment of risk factorsTake a thorough history, paying particular attention to the risk factors above plus: vertebral deformity (if has occurred within 5-10 years, this creates an equivalent risk to any other fragility fracture) loss of height (>3 cm) and/or thoracic kyphosis (consider lateral spine X-ray for vertebral deformity) Preventive actions Encourage a daily dietary calcium intake that meets the age-appropriate Australian recommended daily intake (1000 mg for adult men until 70 years of age and women until 50 years of age, 1300 mg after this age; prevention of bone loss [I, A] but not for fracture prevention [III-2, D]) Encourage healthy lifestyle (eg smoking cessation and limiting alcohol intake) (D) Education and psychosocial support for risk factor modification (Practice Point) Falls reduction strategies: Falls (I, A), and fracture risk reduction (Practice Point) Encourage regular weight-bearing and resistance exercise for the prevention of falls (I, A), bone loss (I, A) and fracture risk reduction (I, C) Advise on appropriate sun exposure levels (which minimise the risk of skin cancer) as a source of vitamin D (II, C)* Discuss absolute risk of fracture (Practice Point)13-19 Bone mineral densitometry (BMD)BMD should be measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanning performed on two sites, preferably antero-posterior spine and hip. Without bone-losing medical conditions (eg hypogonadism, anti-gonadal therapy or corticosteroid use), BMD is unlikely to change significantly in <2 years (II, B) DXA should generally be repeated only when patient is at risk of reaching treatment thresholds (average decrease in T-score is usually approximately 0.1/year if no specific bone-losing medical conditions; Practice Point)8, 20 *Population screening for vitamin D deficiency is not recommended, but targeted testing of people who are at risk of osteoporosis and/or who are at high risk of vitamin D deficiency should be considered. Vitamin D supplements could be considered in deficient individuals if increasing sun exposure is contraindicated or not feasible or if deficiency is more than mild (ie <30 nmol/L) and so is less likely to be corrected by low-risk levels of sun exposure 21 (Practice Point) BMD, bone mineral density; DXA, dual X-ray absorptiometry Quantitative ultrasound An alternative imaging technique for assessing fracture risk is quantitative ultrasound, which measures parameters such as speed of sound (SOS) and broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA), with these values being combined into composite parameters such as stiffness index. These parameters predict fracture to a similar degree as DXA measures of BMD. However, there is no agreed definition of osteoporosis using quantitative ultrasound, and it cannot be used to assess the response to osteoporosis treatment.22 Moreover, intervention trials have predominantly been based on cases identified through DXA assessment, so their results cannot readily be applied to individuals identified by other means.1,3 For this reason, DXA remains the recommended method of assessment.145 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Implementation Several Australian studies have shown an evidence-practice gap, where the majority of people with a fragility fracture tend to have their fracture treated, but not the underlying osteoporosis.23,24 Those with a previous fragility fracture have a very high risk of further fracture, and have greatest benefit from specific anti-osteoporosis treatment. Fracture risk reductions with optimal therapy are substantial and treatment according to current guidelines is recommended unless absolutely contraindicated. This is unlikely given the range of treatments now available. Optimal treatment necessitates the use of a specific anti-osteoporosis treatment such as a bisphosphonate, but also includes ensuring adequate calcium intake and correcting vitamin D deficiency. There are inequities in the use of BMD measurement with relative underuse in men and people from rural and remote locations.25 There is insufficient evidence to support population screening of younger women by DXA. However, if a DXA is performed for a clinical indication, the results could be used opportunistically to improve bone health via feedback of relative fracture risk. In women aged 25-45 years, written feedback of being at high risk compared to not at high risk of fracture in later life (based on mean DXA hip and lumbar spine T-score being less than or greater than or equal or zero) resulted in improved osteoporosis preventive behaviours and femoral neck BMD at two26 and 12 years.27 References 1.

There is no current evidence of patient benefit. However, there is evidence of harms from screening, including significant procedural risk and cost Carotid stenting cannot be recommended because it causes about twice as many strokes or deaths as carotid endarterectomy (CEA), a risk that is not offset by the CEA risk of myocardial infarction Also, asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis patients with particularly high ipsilateral stroke risk who benefit from CEA, in addition to current optimal medical treatment alone, have not been identified. Evidence is insufficient to allow reliable risk stratification. For example, degree of stenosis within the 50-99% stenosis progression, plaque echolucency and transcranial Doppler embolus detection are not specific enough to identify patients likely to benefit from CEA A research priority is to find out if screening to detect asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis improves medical treatment and patient outcomes over screening for, and optimal treatment of, other established vascular risk factors38-43 Cancer Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)Breast cancer Ongoing surveillance strategies for women at high risk of breast cancer may include imaging with MRI.

There is insufficient evidence to support the use of thermography in breast cancer screening or as an adjunctive tool to mammography52, 53 Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) testingBreast cancer Use of a SNPbased breast cancer risk assessment test should only be undertaken after an indepth discussion led by a clinical professional familiar with the implications of genetic risk assessment and testing, including the potential insurance implications Genetic testing should be offered only with pre-test and post-test counselling to discuss the limitations, potential benefits, and possible consequences46, 54-56149 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Screening test Condition Reason not to use References Cancer antigen (CA)125/ transvaginal ultrasoundOvarian cancer There is no evidence to support the use of any test - including pelvic examination, CA125, or other biomarkers, ultrasound (including transvaginal ultrasound), or combination of tests - for routine population-based screening for ovarian cancer CA125 is limited by poor sensitivity in early-stage disease and low specificity. The specificity of transvaginal ultrasound is low. The low prevalence of ovarian cancer means that even screening tests that have very high sensitivity and specificity have a low positive predictive value for disease detection The recently reported UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) trial of transvaginal ultrasound +/- CA125 found no significant difference in mortality over 0-14 years Secondary analyses suggest a possible benefit of screening using transvaginal ultrasound and CA125, but further follow-up is needed before firm conclusions can be reached on the long-term efficacy and cost- effectiveness of ovarian cancer screening46, tomography (CT) colonographyColorectal cancer (CRC)These have good sensitivity for cancer and advanced polyps, and are more acceptable than colonoscopy, but there is no current evidence of the reduction of CRC mortality. There are several trials under way to assess effectiveness and cost effectiveness of this as a screening strategy Neither optical colonoscopy nor CT colonography are recommended for primary screening because there is no current RCT evidence of effectiveness in relation to any harms62-69 Whole-body CT or MRI Cancer Whole-body imaging has not been shown to improve quality of life and/or decrease mortality. It is associated with additional radiation exposure and a high number of false positive results. There are no RCTs of whole- body imaging to detect cancer or CVD70-77 Lung disease Spirometry Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)Screening with spirometry in the absence of symptoms has no net benefit Opportunistic case-finding should be considered in high-risk individuals. These include those aged >40 years, plus either: symptoms (chronic cough, increased sputum production, wheezing or dyspnoea) history of exposure to relevant environmental factors such as cigarette smoke Several questionnaires\u00a7 are useful and if positive, should be followed by spirometry by a trained professional (consensus statement)78-83150 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Screening test Condition Reason not to use References Endocrine Thyroid function tests Thyroid dysfunctionDespite the relatively high incidence of subclinical hypothyroidism in older women (up to 17%), there is a lack of convincing data from controlled trials that early treatment reduces lipid levels, symptoms or the risk for CVD in patients with mild thyroid dysfunction detected by screening There is no evidence supporting an increased risk for stroke associated with subclinical thyroid dysfunction More research is needed to determine the clinical benefits associated with thyroid screening84-89 Chronic disease prevention Vitamin D Vitamin D deficiencyCurrent evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults90-97 Heel ultrasound Osteoporosis While there is some evidence that heel ultrasound in combination with femoral neck bone densitometry better predicts hip fracture, there are no RCTs showing any benefit of using heel ultrasound as the primary screening tool for osteoporosis, nor is its usefulness as a pre-screening tool in tandem with dual-energy X-ray treating non-pregnant adults with asymptomatic bacteriuria does not improve outcomes and may increase antibiotic resistance. The only two exceptions to this are pregnancy and a patient who is about to undergo a urological procedure104, 105 Other tests Enquiry about sleep Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA)The prevalence of undiagnosed OSA is high and it is associated with considerable morbidity. While there are some screening tools that are available, there are no large-scale RCTs showing the benefit or cost-benefit of routine screening for OSA in primary care Case-finding for OSA may be beneficial in commercial vehicle drivers and pilots, but it has not been mandated by any government authority106-109 Bimanual pelvic exam During a routine Papanicolaou (Pap) test in an asymptomatic womanA bimanual examination performed as part of routine Pap smear examination is of no proven benefit, but studies are limited It has been shown to be not an effective screening method for ovarian cancer detection110-113151 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition *CCTA involves the use of multi-slice CT and intravenously administered contrast material to obtain detailed images of the blood vessels of the heart. It has been used as an alternative to conventional invasive coronary angiography for evaluating CAD and coronary artery anomalies. CCTA requires high doses of ionizing radiation, with an average dose of 8.1 milliSieverts for patients weighing 75 kg. This dose is approximately two to three times higher than the average radiation dose administered to patients during conventional coronary angiography CT calcium scoring (also known as Coronary Calcium Scan and Coronary Artery Calcium Scoring). A good summary on CT calcium score can be found at www.aetna.com/cpb/medical/data/200_299/0228.html [Accessed 26 May 2016] There are no current Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) rebates for performing cardiac CT in asymptomatic individuals. \u00a7Refer to the Lung Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening Table 15.2. Screening tests of indeterminate value Screening test Condition Reason not to use References Vitamin D Pregnancy Pregnant women with one or more risk factors for low vitamin D levels should have their serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels measured at their first antenatal visit Risk factors for low vitamin D levels are lack of skin exposure to sunlight, dark skin, southerly latitude, conditions affecting vitamin D metabolism and storage (including obesity) and, for infants, being born to a mother with low vitamin D levels and exclusive breastfeeding combined with at least one other risk factor.92, 114-17 Vascular Ultrasound Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)National screening of men aged 65 years has been successfully introduced in the UK and parts of Scandinavia for AAA. However, it is unclear what the impact of the lower- than-expected prevalence (<2%) of AAAs will be on the long-term benefit The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening of older male smokers. Limiting screening to this sub-group has raised some ethical issues and may influence cost-effectiveness Unpublished recent data from the Western Australian trial of screening for AAA suggests that the magnitude of the benefit from screening men aged 65 years does not warrant the introduction of a national AAA screening program in Australia at this stage118-23152 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition Screening test Condition Reason not to use References B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)Congestive cardiac failureThe evidence for screening for heart failure using BNP is mixed despite its sensitivity and prognostic significance. It may be useful in excluding the condition in suspected heart failure. A recent, pragmatic, un- blinded randomised controlled trial (RCT) has shown some benefit for BNP screening in high-risk groups, but large scale trials are needed to confirm these findings and establish feasibility and cost effectiveness25, 124-30 Cancer Low-dose chest computed tomographyLung cancer A large trial in the US has shown that patients selected for high lung cancer risk have reduced lung cancer and total mortality within a carefully conducted LDCT screening program in the context of a structured program of selection, screening, evaluation, and management of the relatively high number of benign abnormalities Performing CT scans in high-risk individuals outside well-designed and conducted research programs may lack any benefit and may be harmful. Low-risk persons should not have screening CT as the reasonably foreseeable benefits are lower and may be substantially outweighed by harms. More accurate data on the identification of the appropriate target group including the threshold for absolute lung cancer risk, are required before any recommendation on LDCT131-38 Positron emission tomography - computed tomography (or PET CT scan)Lung cancer There is no current evidence of benefit for PET screening for lung cancer135, 139, 140 Elderly Visual acuity Visual impairment Current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for impaired visual acuity in older adults141-43 ; USPSTF, US Preventive Services Task Force153 Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice 9th edition References 1.
