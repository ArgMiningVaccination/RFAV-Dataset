For example, a child 2 months of age, must have 1 dose each of DTaP, Polio , Hib, and PCV before being permitted to enter child care/preschool . A child entering at a younger age range than listed above must have proof of receiving vaccines in the previous age bracket. Example: A child entering child care/preschool at 11 months of age, would need at least the following: 3 DTaP, 2 Polio, 2 Hib, and 2 PCV . If a child has not received any vaccines, he/she would need at least one dose of each required vaccine to enter school provis ionally and be in the process of receiving the remaining doses as rapidly and as medically feasible. The current seasonal flu vaccine is required every year by December 31 for children 6 -59 months of age.NJ Department of Health (NJDOH) Vaccine Preventable Disease Program Summary of NJ Child Care/Preschool Immunization Requirements Listed in the chart below are the minimum required number of doses your child must have to attend a NJ child care/preschool.* This is strictly a summary document.

At least 1 dose given on or after the first birthday Pneumococcal conjugate (PCV 13) Dose #1 Dose #2 1-4 doses (see footnote)At least 1 dose given on or after the first birthday Measles, mumps, rubella each year| CHILD CARE/PRES CHOOL DIRECTORS AND PARENTS: IMMUNIZATION REQUIREMENTS *Interpretation: Children need to receive the minimum number of age -appropriate vaccines prior to entering child care/pres chool. For example, a child 2 months of age, must have 1 dose each of DTaP, Polio , Hib, and PCV before being permitted to enter child care/preschool . A child entering at a younger age range than listed above must have proof of receiving vaccines in the previous age bracket. Example: A child entering child care/preschool at 11 months of age, would need at least the following: 3 DTaP, 2 Polio, 2 Hib, and 2 PCV . If a child has not received any vaccines, he/she would need at least one dose of each required vaccine to enter school provis ionally and be in the process of receiving the remaining doses as rapidly and as medically feasible. The current seasonal flu vaccine is required every year by December 31 for children 6 -59 months of age.Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and pneumococcal (PCV) vaccines are special cases. If children started late with th ese vaccin es they may need fewer doses. One dose of each is required on or after the first birthday in all cases . Please Note: The use of combination vaccines may allow students to receive the 1st birthday booster dose of Hib between 15- 18 months of age. MMR vaccine may be given as early as 12 months of age , but NJ requires childr en to receive the vaccine by 15 months of age. Prior to age 15 months, children may enter preschool/child care without a documented dose of MMR. \u00a7Varicella vaccine may be given as early as 12 months of age , but NJ require s children t o receive the vaccine by 19 months of age. Prior to age 19 months, children may enter preschool/chil d care without a documented dose of varicella. Children who previously had chickenpox do not nee d t o receive the varicella vaccine as long as a parent/guardian can provide the school with one of the following: 1) Documented laboratory evidence showing immunity (protection) from chickenpox, 2) A physician's written statement that the child previously had chickenpox, or 3) A parent's written statement that the child previously had chickenpox. |Seasonal Flu: The current seasonal influenza vaccine is required every year for those children 6 months through 59 months of age. Children who have not received the flu vaccine by December 31 must be excluded (not allowed to attend child care/preschool) for the duration of influenza season (through March 31), until they receive at least one dose of the influenza vaccine or until they turn 60 months of age. Children entering child care/preschool after December 31, must provide documentation of receiving the current seasonal flu vaccine. Children enteri ng child care/preschool after March 31 are not required to receive the flu vaccine; however, flu season may extend until May and therefore getting a flu vaccine even late i n the season is still protective. NOTE: NJ also accepts valid medical and religious exemptions (reasons for not showing proof of immunizations) as per the NJ Immunization of Pupils in School regulations, (N.J.A.C. 8:57 -4). Children without proof of immunity as defined by ACIP, including those with medical and religious exemptions, may be excluded from a school, preschool, or child care facility during a vaccine preventable disease outbreak or threatened outbrea k as determined by the Commissioner, Department of Health or his or her designee. In addition, anybody having control of a school may, on account of the prevalence of any communicable disease, or to prevent the spread of communicable disease, prohibit the attendance of any teac her or pupil of any school under their control and specify the time during which the teacher or scholar shal l remain away from school. The Department of Health shall provide guidance to the school of the appropriateness of any such prohibition. This document is meant to be a quick resource.

DTaP: Children who previously attended child care/preschool should have received 4 doses since the requirement to receive the fourth birthday booster dose (5th dose) does not apply until they attend Kindergarten. However, if one of these 4 doses was given on or after the 4th birthday, an additional dose is not needed for Kindergarten. Alternatively, any 5 doses are acceptable. Children seven years and older who are not fully immunized with DTaP vaccine should have a history of receiving at least three doses of DTaP, Td, and/or Tdap or should use the CDC Catch -Up schedule to get caught up. Tdap given at ages 10 and older can count towards the sixth- grade school requirement. For CDC schedules and catch -up guidance , visit https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/catchup.html . Polio : Children who previously attended child care/preschool should have 3 doses since the requirement to receive the fourth birthday booster dose (4th dose) does not apply until they attend Kindergarten. However, if one of these 3 doses was given on or after the 4th birthday, no additional doses are needed for Kindergarten. Alternatively , any 4 doses are acceptable. \u00a7MMR: Children are required to receive two doses of measles, one dose of mumps, and one dose of rubella once they enter Kindergarten. Since single antigen (separate components of the vaccine) is not readily available, most children will have two MMR vaccines. The Antibody Titer Law (Holly's Law, NJSA 26:2N -8-11), passed on January 14, 2004, requires the New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH) to accept serologic evidence of protective immunity to measles, mumps and rubella in lieu of the second ACIP recommended measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. For more information, please visit http://nj.gov/health/cd/documents/antibody_titer_law.pdf . |Varicella vaccine is only required for children born on or after January 1, 1998. Children who previously had chickenpox do not need to receive the varicella vaccine as long as a parent /guardian can provide the school with one of the following: 1) Documented laboratory evidence showing immunity (protection) from chickenpox, 2) A physician's written statement that the child previously had chickenpox, or 3) A parent's written statement that the child previously had chickenpox. \u00b6M eningococcal and Tdap vaccines are required for all entering 6th graders who are 11 years of age or older . If in 6th grade and under age 11, children must receive the vaccines within 2 weeks of their 11th birthday. Meningococcal (MenACWY) vaccines administered at age 10 or older will be accepted for NJ school attendance. As of the 2020 -2021 school year, children who receive a Tdap before age 10 would need to receive an additional dose to meet NJ's immunization requirements for sixth grade and higher. Note, ACIP no longer recommends a minimum interval between a dose of Tdap and a tetanus -diphtheria -containing vaccine, however, current rule [N.J.A.C. 8:57 -4.10(i)] states a minimum of five years must have elapsed from the last tetanus -and diphtheria -containing dose. NOTE: NJ also accepts valid medical and religious exemptions (reasons for not showing proof of immunizations) as per the NJ Immunization of Pupils in School r egulations, (N.J.A.C. 8:57 -4). Children without proof of immunity as defined by ACIP, including those with medical and religious exemptions, may be excluded from a school, preschool, or child care facility during a vaccine preventable disease outbreak or threatened outbreak as determined by the Commissioner, Department of Health or his or her designee. In addition, anybody having control of a school may, on account of the prevalence of any communicable disease, or to prevent the spread of communicable disease, prohibit the attendance of any teacher or pupil of any school under their control and specify the time during which the teacher or scholar shall remain away from school. The Department of Health shall provide guidance to the school of the appropriateness of any such prohibition. This document is meant to be a quick resource.
