Today many people are aware that our diet is often lacking in certain beneficial nutrients, especially those who eat mainly processed foods, such as readymade meals, sausages, ham etc. Breaking open the kernels to remove the seeds There are no nasty side effects from eating apricot seeds, but it is important to get organic seeds which have no fertilisers or pesticides used on the fruit trees. The small seeds which grow at altitudes of over 6,000 feet in the Himalayas are found to be the most beneficial. Here the apricots grow wild and are gathered by the local villagers. Then the fruit is either eaten or dried on walls. The kernels are always saved and broken open to extract the seeds. In this way the local villagers can earn much needed extra income. 10-20 seeds can be taken during the day; they taste a little like bitter almonds. It is best to start with just a few seeds and build the quantity up slowly over a period of days. To help prevent cancer cells from forming, take 5-10 seeds a day. Lifestyle and diet as well as other complementary therapies are also very important in the prevention and treatment of cancer. Further Reading 1.

We are constantly exposed to toxins through the food we eat and the air we breathe. But, how do these toxins really affect our bodies? - Mucosa wall breaks down leading to chronic inflammation; - Toxins colonize themselves and are stored in fatty tissues, slows down intestinal action, waste excretion, and nutrient absorption; - Blocks lymphatic drainage; - Weakens immune system; - Destroys useful bacteria; - Liver becomes overburdened and functions improperly - your liver needs a break! - Causes a Toxic Colon! If the waste is not being moved out of the Colon on a regular basis, it can accumulate and cause destruction and dehydration in the gut - just like your kitchen sink getting clogged up - you need to clean it so it does not cause any more issues. Feel Lethargic Often? We all get tired occasionally, but when occasional lethargy becomes a problem and recurs regularly, you need to look more deeper into the reasons why this lethargy is affecting you. When you are dragged down by the content of a toxic colon, this can give rise to headaches, make you feel that you don't have much energy and feel very irritable. Sound familiar? Natural Colon Cleansing helps purge your body of built-up waste, improving nutritional uptake while expelling toxins at the same time. The cleansing process helps support digestive health and optimises digestive function, but can also naturally revitalise and rejuvenate your liver, lungs, kidneys and other vital organ systems. Ready to Explore Colon, Internal, and Parasite Cleansing? Restoring your digestive health is the most important step to reasserting the natural internal balance necessary for improved nutrition, immune function and overall well-being.

CPM has been used to treat low back pain with clinically significant results3. By creating a sideways oscillating motion through the spine, the flow of synovial fluid between the discs can be encouraged, helping to reduce inflammation and ease pain, as well as improving range of motion. The FlexxiCore\u00ae Passive Exerciser combines the therapeutic back care benefits of CPM with the energizing and calming effects of a simple exercise machine popularised by the Japanese. The user simply lies down, puts their feet up on a cushioned cradle, and lets the FlexxiCore's robust motor do the work. The body's natural response to the swinging of the feet is a pleasant goldfish-like motion from the hips up, releasing tension in back, neck and shoulders, deepening respiration, and boosting circulation. Research has shown that back pain can often be attributed to an inability to relax, physically and/or mentally4. A regular rocking motion is also known to help synchronize brain waves and calm the nervous system5. Another area of research has shown how cartilage production in degenerative joints can be stimulated by relatively small degrees of motion, thus allowing for better gliding of the joint surfaces without pain or restriction6. At the recent Back Pain Show at Olympia, 50 visitors were offered a 5-minute session on the FlexxiCore, with 84% reporting having experienced stiffness or pain in their Back / Neck / Shoulders (\"BNS\") recently. Each reported on what they noticed during and after a 5-minute session: 72% reported feeling more relaxed / calmer; 54% noticed a reduction in tension; 40% said it had immediately helped BNS problems; 32% reported feeling more energetic; and 85% felt the session was of benefit for their condition, including 35 of the 42 (83.3%) who had recent BNS stiffness or pain. Case studies from Practitioner Trials with over 200 healthcare professionals have previously confirmed the FlexxiCore's benefits with a broad range of health conditions7. One practitioner's client had back problems following removal of a benign tumour. After just 11 sessions she reported relief of tension in the back, increased mobility, better posture, and improved feelings of hope and courage for the future.8 References 1.

Ramsay and Acheson were unequivocal: \"Complete rest, from the beginning of the illness gives the best prognosis\". And if the patient's circumstances didn't permit them to rest, the illness resulted in a permanent state of exhaustion. The 25% of the severely ill would tell you that exhaustion is a very mild term for the suffering they endure, all day, every day. Yet the influential psychiatrists who control both medical and public opinion about this illness insist that rest is damaging, and exercise is a 'safe and effective' treatment. I wrote The Beginner's Guide to ME/CFS because I was lucky enough to escape from the attentions of misguided medical advice, I was never forced into Guided Exercise Therapy (GET), and I am well enough to produce a book to help others escape from the idea that these practices are helpful, and hopefully, escape through resting, into a pathway towards improvement. It made me sad that one reviewer was so discouraged by the message of my book, because it felt like 'just giving up'. I hoped that maybe she did 'just give up', at least give up the exhausting efforts many patients make, going to doctor after doctor, appointment after appointment - when each visit sets them back another few weeks. My reader wasn't apparently able to understand the whole message - which is 'give up, to get better'. 'Giving up' - that is, resting because the illness requires it, getting every physical aide possible, using a wheelchair as a useful tool - it is all about conserving muscular exertion. Because muscular exertion is what makes us worse, and conserving it is what allows our body to galvanize its own healing mechanisms. ME is an autoimmune disease which usually follows a relatively minor viral infection. Our immune system becomes very active, but can't find the culprit. Medical researchers are still looking for the culprit, and there may be many. In the meantime, we have, often suddenly, become extremely disabled - not by paralysis, but by the failure of our muscles to function after a very short time, and delayed and protracted exhaustion after exertion. Our cognitive abilities are also affected, with problems of short term memory, confusion, and inability to solve problems or follow stories. Our endocrine regulatory system is out of whack, so sleep rhythms, temperature regulation, appetite are not working properly, we may have headaches, and we have an ongoing low fever, swollen and sensitive lymph glands and sore throat, all evidence of immune activation. Les Simpson explains how haemorheology understand what is going on and how it can help. But no one yet has a cure, and in the meantime, we are left with the resources of our own body. Which, given a chance, can gradually give us some improvement, if not a complete recovery. It's not expensive, we can all do it, we can all afford it, and conserving our resources is all that we've got, until more is learned. I wish I could magically give a copy of my book to everyone who gets this illness, and if I could, I would. In the meantime, all I can do is tell you about it.

Water Re-Energizing Coaster Water has amazing properties that make it different from all other liquids and drinking water that is full of energy gives us more energy, relieves aches and pains, enables our bodies to work more efficiently and just makes us feel better. However, we know that when water travels through straight pipes and is treated with chemicals it loses its' energy until it becomes flat and its' ability to carry information (which is vital for our bodies) diminishes. So what can you do about it? We can help water by filtering it and then enabling it to re-energise by using the new re-energising coaster! Just stand a jug or glass of water on the coaster for at least 5 minutes and the information encoded into the design re-energises the water. Harness the Power of Quantum Physics and reap the health benefits! A Flintshire Kinesiologist has been inspired to develop a water energising coaster that has the ability to enhance health and wellbeing in those who use it. The coaster has a specific design that uses information from quantum physics and water experts. It is made from glass which also creates a vibrational element and delivers the relevant energy to the water. Peta Pendlebury, a therapist from Hope near Wrexham, plans to market the product across the UK and beyond through trade dealings and via one to one sales. Many of us will already be familiar with machines and jugs that have the ability to re energise water through magnetism or use of a vortex but this Water Re-Energising Coaster offers similar benefits but has the added bonus of being lightweight and compact and accessible to those with modest budgets and retails at just \u00a39.99 plus p&p. Victor Schauberger, a world renowned water researcher and ecologist said \"When water travels through straight pipes and is treated with chemicals it loses its energy until it becomes flat and its ability to carry information (which is vital for our bodies) diminishes.\" Peta sees herself as the facilitator for the product and the benefits it brings to others. She believes, like Victor Shauberger, that drinking water that is full of energy goes into our cells more easily and gives us more energy, relieves aches and pains, enables our bodies to work more efficiently and just makes us feel better. The coaster has a specific design that uses information from quantum physics and water experts. It is made from glass which also creates a vibrational element. The beauty of this product is that it can easily be carried in a handbag or purse and taken out for use as and when needed. You simply place a bottle, glass or jug of water on the coaster for 5 minutes to reap the benefits of use.

Bible Bruton-Seal and Matthew Seal Published by Merlin Unwin Books. Sept 2014. Hardback. \u00a325. ISBN: 978-1-906122-51-5. In 1640 a London master apothecary, herbalist and gardener called John Parkinson published his life's work on the healing 'vertues' of all the plants he had encountered. His lively and enquiring mind, combined with his expert herbalist skills, resulted in the surprisingly readable and informative text we can study today. It also shines a fascinating light on the health problems of 17th century Britain, in the days when infection often meant death, childbirth caused lifetime problems for women, and the plague, rabid dogs, a plethora of skin complaints, persistent coughs, fevers and stomach upsets challenged all, from King to pauper. Parkinson's massive, 1,788 page book, has never been reprinted: perhaps it was simply too big. Today, Julie Bruton-Seal has used her extensive professional herbalist's skills to write a modern commentary on Parkinson's classic herbal. She and writer Matthew Seal have selected for this new book some of the most fascinating entries from the Stuart Theatrum Botanicum, rediscovering in the process many long-forgotten remedies, concurring with Parkinson's theories which now seem so ahead of their time, and recommending new practical ways of interpreting Parkinson's immense wisdom and learning for the 21st century. The result is an exciting new practical herbal, putting ancient wisdom into modern use. Matthew Seal's thoughtful introduction to The Herbalist's Bible gathers together some fascinating research into the life, times and work of John Parkinson, Herbalist to King Charles I. Herbalist to King Charles I, John Parkinson (1567-1650) was a master apothecary, herbalist and gardener. Famous in his own lifetime for his influential books, his magnum opus was published in 1640: the Theatrum Botanicum, which ran to 1,788 large pages. The sheer scope and size was perhaps to prove the book's downfall because, while it was much revered and indeed plagiarized, it was never reprinted and now has the status of an extremely valuable rare book. Parkinson was writing at a time when Western herbalism was at its zenith and his skills as a plantsman (from his grounds in Covent Garden) combined perfectly with his passion for science, observation and historical scholarship.
