We study both the host cell receptors and their complexes with viral glycoproteins by using integrative structural biology approaches - cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography - combined with biochemistry, immunology and virology techniques. | | |[Bogunovic Lab](http://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/bogunoviclab/) |Focusing on the study of innate and adaptive immune systems using human forward immunogenetics | | |[Bouvier Lab](http://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/bouvierlab/) |Studying host and viral factors that affect the respiratory transmission of influenza viruses | | |[Branch Lab](http://icahn.mssm.edu/research/programs/studies-of-the-hepatitis-c-virus) |Conducting a wide variety of research on Hepatitis C Virus | | |[Chen Lab](http://icahn.mssm.edu/research/labs/benjamin-chen-laboratory) |Exploring the use of clinical genome informatics | | |[Evans Lab](http://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/matthew-j-evans) |Investigating how hosts and viruses interact, with a focus on the hepatitis C virus | | |[Fernandez-Sesma Lab](http://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/ana-fernandez-sesma) |Researching the interactions of important human pathogens with primary human immune cells | | |[Hioe Laboratory](http://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/hioelab/) |Investigating HIV envelope-mediated immunity and pathogenesis to design more effective preventive and therapeutic measures against HIV | | |[Johnson Lab](https://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/johnsonlab/people/jeffrey-r-johnson/) |Studies how pathogens remodel their host environments. | | |[Krammer Lab](http://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/florian-krammer) |Conducting research in various aspects of microbiology | | |[Lee Lab](http://icahn.mssm.edu/research/labs/lee-laboratory) |Exploring how viruses co-opt basic cell biological processes, and the myriad strategies used by viruses to propagate themselves | | |[Lim Lab](http://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/jean-k-lim) |Studying leukocyte trafficking events at the molecular and cellular level as they relate to host defense mechanisms and genetic susceptibility; developing new models to evaluate WNV and other flavivirus infections | | |[Marazzi Lab](http://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/ivan-marazzi) |Investigating epigenetic- and chromatin- mediated control of gene expression in the context of cellular response to pathogens or cellular differentiation | | |[Moran Lab](http://icahn.mssm.edu/research/institutes/experimental-therapeutics-institute/cores/center-for-therapeutic-antibody-development-ctad) |Collaborating on researchers in the design and development of monoclonal antibodies | | |[Palese Lab](http://icahn.mssm.edu/research/labs/palese-laboratory) |Focusing on genetic make-up and biology of viruses, as well as virus-host interactions | | |[Rosenberg Lab](http://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/rosenberglab/) |Studies host response to viral infection using genomics | | |[Simon Lab](http://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/simonlab/) |Investigating virus-host |[tenOever Lab](http://icahn.mssm.edu/research/labs/tenoever-laboratory) on the interplay viruses and small RNAs | | |[Tortorella Lab](http://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/domenico-tortorella) |Examining how viruses evade immune detection | | |[Weber Lab](http://icahn.mssm.edu/research/labs/weber-laboratory) |Focusing on on adeno-associated virus, a promising gene therapy vector | | |[Zolla-Pazner Lab](http://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/zolla-paznerlab/) |Developing and testing rationally-designed vaccines to prevent HIV infection, and also using the HIV envelope epitopes bound by human monoclonal antibodies to guide our vaccine design and test the vaccines in rabbits and monkeys to screen which vaccines are most immunogenic and should proceed to human trials. | "}
