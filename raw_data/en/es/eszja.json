I've seen my patients look and feel better as a result. Who cares how it works as long as it does?\" Six counter-arguments: 1. therapy could also do harm 2. endorsement leads to use as an alternative 3. even effective therapies have a placebo-effect 4. doctors should not delegate empathy 5. therapy costs \u00a3100 per session 6. endorsement of mystical nonsense undermines rationality PPSPPS--1111--0606 KK\u00f6\u00f6lnln--55--4040It follows: The use of an ineffective CAM is rarely justified. Prescribe a treatment with specific effects and maximize non-specific effects simultaneously.
