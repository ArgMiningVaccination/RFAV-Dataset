PHARMACY AND THERAPEUTICS (P&T) COMMITTEE The services of an independent National Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee (\"P&T Committee\") are utilized to approve safe and clinically effective drug therapies. The P&T Committee is an external advisory body of clinical professionals from across the United States. The P&T Committee's voting members include physicians, pharmacists, a pharmacoeconomist and a medical ethicist, all of whom have a broad background of clinical and academic expertise regarding prescription drugs. Employees with significant clinical expertise are invited to meet with the P&T Committee, but no CVS Caremark employee may vote on issues before the P&T Committee. Voting members of the P&T Committee must disclose any financial relationship or conflicts of interest with any pharmaceutical manufacturers. DRUG LIST PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS There are two ways to find your drug on this drug list: 1. Medical Conditions The drugs on this drug list are grouped by the type of medical conditions they are used to treat. For example, drugs used to treat a heart condition are listed under Cardiovascular. If you know what your drug is used for, look for the category name in the list and then look under the category name for your drug. 2. Alphabetical Listing If you are not sure what category to look under, look for your drug in the Index at the end of the drug list. The Index is an alphabetical list of all drugs in this document. Both brand-name drugs and generic drugs are in the Index. Look in the Index and find your drug. 7 \u00a92023 CVS Health and/or one of its affiliates. All rights reserved. 106-25954B 040123 Next to your drug, see the page number where you can find the coverage information. Turn to the page listed in the Index and find the name of your drug in the first column of the list. The first column of the chart lists the drug name. Brand-name drugs are capitalized (e.g., LIPITOR). Generic drugs are listed in the lower-case italics (e.g., atorvastatin ). The information in the Requirements/Limits column tells you if there are any special requirements for coverage of your drug. Their requirements and limits may include: Prior Authorization : Your plan needs you (or your doctor) to get prior approval or authorization for certain drugs. This means that you need to get approval from your plan before you fill your prescriptions. Quantity Limits : For certain drugs, your plan limits the amount of the drug that it will cover. Your plan may also limit the amount of drugs you may receive within a class of drugs. For example, for opioid-na\u00efve members aged 19 or younger, certain drugs within the opioid class are limited to a three-day or less supply. Step Therapy : Your plan needs you to try certain drugs as the first step to treat your medical condition before covering another drug for that condition. For example, if Drug A and Drug B both treat your medical condition, your plan may not cover Drug B unless you try Drug A first. If Drug A does not work for get approval, your plan may not cover the drug. LEGEND Symbol Name AGE Age Limit OTC Over the counter PA Prior Authorization PA* If Quantity Limit is exceeded, Prior Authorization may apply PA** If Step Therapy requirements are not met, Prior Authorization may apply QL Quantity Limit SP Specialty Drug ST Step Therapy GENERIC SUBSTITUTION Generic substitution is a pharmacy action whereby a generic version is dispensed rather than a prescribed brand-name product. In most instances, a brand-name drug for which a generic product becomes available will become non-formulary, with the generic product covered in its place, upon release of the generic product to the market. However, the document is subject to state specific regulations and rules regarding generic substitution and mandatory generic rules apply where appropriate. Generic drugs are usually priced lower than their brand-name equivalents. Prescription generic drugs are: Approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for safety and effectiveness and are manufactured under the same strict standards that apply to brand-name drugs. Tested in humans to assure the generic is absorbed into the bloodstream in a similar rate and extent compared to the brand-name drug (bioequivalence). Generics may be different from the brand in size, color and inactive ingredients, but this does not alter their effectiveness or ability to be absorbed just like the brand-name drug. Manufactured in the same strength and dosage form as the brand-name drugs. When a generic drug is substituted for a brand-name drug, you can expect the generic to produce the same clinical effect and safety profile as the brand-name drug (therapeutic equivalence). 8 \u00a92023 CVS Health and/or one of its affiliates.

Certain medications on the list are covered if utilization management criteria are met (i.e., Step Therapy, Prior Authorization, Quantity Limits, etc.); requests for use of such medications outside of their listed criteria will be reviewed for medical necessity. If a medication is not listed on the document, a formulary exception may be requested for coverage. Medical necessity or formulary exception requests will be reviewed based on drug- specific prior authorization criteria or standard non-formulary prescription request criteria. Special note for opioid containing products: The quantity of opioid product prescribed (including those that are combined with acetaminophen, aspirin, or ibuprofen) will be limited to up to 90 morphine milligram equivalents (MME) per day based on a 30 day supply. Members who are opioid-na\u00efve will be required to use an immediate-release (IR) formulation before moving to an extended-release (ER) formulation and will be subject to quantity limit restrictions. 9 \u00a92023 CVS Health and/or one of its affiliates.

II. COMMITMENT TO MBE/WBE PARTICIPATION A. In order to be considered responsive, the submit ter shall commit to the expenditure of at least 25% of the total contract price with MBEs (\"MBE goal\") and at least 5% with WBEs (\"WBE goal\"), and identify by category the type of work, goods, or se rvice that will be provided by MBE/WBE firms, unless, prior to the submission of the proposal, the Park District grants a percentage reduction or a waiver through the proce ss detailed in Section II.F below. The Director of Purchasing, subject to the approval of the General Superintendent, ma y extend the period for the granting of reductions or waivers in order to increase the opportunities for the participation of MBEs and/or WBEs in the performance of the contract. B. If the submitter is a certified MBE firm, the WBE requirement must still be met . If the submitter is a certified WBE firm, the MBE requirement must still be met . A business enterprise owned by a woman who is a member of a minority group may be c ounted on a particular contract as an MBE or a WBE, but not both . C. The total dollar value of the submitter's MBE or WBE direct participation and indirect participation shall be counted toward the MBE and/or WBE goals. D. If the contract value is increased through a c hange order or contract modification, the MBE and WBE expenditures must increase proportionally. E. The commitment to achieve the MBE goal and the WBE goal may be met by: 1. the submitter's status as a MBE or a WBE; or 2. the submitter's status as a joint venturer wi th one or more MBEs and/or WBEs. The percentage of the ownership and control of the MBE joint venturer or WBE joint venturer shall be the percentage of participation counted toward the MBE goal and/or the WBE goal. A joint venture is eligible for participation as an MBE and/ or WBE, if, and only if, all of the following requirements are satisfied: a. the MBE or WBE venturer(s) participat es in the ownership, control, management responsibilities, risks and profits of the joint venture in proportion with the MBE and/or WBE ownership percentage; b. the MBE and/or WBE venturer(s) is responsible for a clearly defined portion of the work of the contract in proportion with the MBE's and/or WBE's ownership percentage; and c. the MBE and/or WBE venturer(s) actually performs with its own forces and using its own equipment, work equal to at least 75% of the va lue of its ownership of the joint venture. The Director of Purchasing, in consultation with appropriate Park District staff, will evaluate the proposed joint venture agreement and all other relevant documents to determine whether these requirements have been satisfied; or 3. subcontracting a portion of the work of the contract to one or more MBEs and/or WBEs: a. A submitter may count toward its MBE or WBE goal only expenditures to firms that perform a commercially useful function in the work of the contact. b. Brokering will not be counted toward the Program's goals . Consistent with normal industry practices, a MBE or WBE may enter in to subcontracts; however, if an MBE or WBE subcontracts a significantly greater portion of t he work of the contract than would be expected on the basis of normal industry practices, the MBE or WBE shall be presumed not to be performing a commercially useful function. The submitter may present evidence to rebut this presumption. Where an MBE or WBE, consistent wi th industry practices, intends to enter into further subcontracts totaling more than 25% of the value of the MBE's or WBE's subcontract, the MBE or WBE must submit all documents r equired by Section IV of these Conditions regarding all further subcontracts, except that reductions or waivers of the MBE goal or WBE goal need not be obtained. However, the dollar val ue of any work that is further subcontracted to other than MBEs and/or WBEs shall not be counted toward the attainment of the bidder's MBE and/or WBE goals. This provision does not apply to MBEs or WBEs who represent manufacturers. Agreements between a submitte r and an MBE or WBE in which the MBE or WBE promises not to provide subcontracting quot ations to other submitters are prohibited. 4. the purchase of materials or services used in or related to the performance of the contract from one or more MBEs and/or WBEs; or 5. Any combination of the foregoing. F. Reduction or Waiver of the MBE goal and/or WBE goal The Director of Purchasing, in c onsultation with appropriate Park Di strict staff, shall consider any request for a reduction or a waiver of the MBE goal and/or the WBE goal when necessary. A reduction or waiver may be granted if, among other things, the reasonable and necessary requirements of the contract render sufficient subcontr acting, joint venturing or other participation of MBEs and/or WBEs unfeasible or excessively cost ly; or, sufficient MBEs and/or WBEs capable of providing the goods and services required by the cont ract are not readily available despite affirmative efforts to locate such businesses. 1. If a submitter determines that it is unable to meet the required MBE goal and/or the WBE goal through direct subcontracts, the submitter should attempt to meet the goals through indirect subcontracts. 2. In the rare instance in which indirect subcontra cting also is not possible, the submitter must request a reduction or a waiver of the goal(s) prior to submission of its proposal . In order to obtain a reduction or waiver, the submitter mu st document its unsucces sful solicitation (as either subcontractors or joint venturers) of a reasonable number of the appropriately certified MBEs and WBEs. Documentation must incl ude, but is not necessarily limited to: a. a detailed statement of efforts to identify and select portions of work identified in the proposal solicitation for subcontracting to or joint venturing with MBEs and WBEs; and b. a listing of all MBEs and WBEs contacted and not utilized, including: i. names, addresses and telephone numbers of MBEs and WBEs solicited; ii. date, time and method of contact; iii. a statement from each contacted MBE or W BE explaining why it was not available to do the work, or a statement that t he MBE or WBE did not respond; and iv. where relevant, documentation of all pr ices quoted by all subcontractors. III. COMPLIANCE WITH MBE/WBE REQUIREMENTS A. Proposal 1. In the MBE/WBE Affidavit provided in the submit tal documents, the submitter must commit to a minimum of 25% MBE and 5% WBE participation in any contract awarded to the submitter as a result of this proposal solicitation, and identif y by category the type of work, goods, or service that will be provided by MBE/WBE firms. 2.

B. Prior to award 1. Schedule A: Statement of Prime Submitter Regarding MBE/WBE Utilization . During the pre- award evaluation period, the potential awardee will be required to submit a completed Schedule A, committing to the utilization of each listed MBE and WBE, including MBE and WBE joint venturers. That submitter must commit to the expenditure of a specific dollar and/or percentage amount of participation by each MBE and WBE firm. The total dollar or percentage commitment to proposed MBE firms must at least equal the MBE goal of 25%. The total dollar or percentage commitment to proposed WBE firms must at least equal the WBE goal of 5%. The submitter is responsible for calculating the dollar equival ent of the MBE and WBE goals. All commitments made in Schedule A must conform to the submitted Schedule Bs. The submitter will not be permitted to substitute another firm for the MBEs and/or WBEs listed in Schedule A, except as described in Section IV. C. of these Conditions. 2. Schedule B: Letter of Intent from MBE or W BE to Perform as Subcontractor, Supplier and/or Consultant as included in the Submitter's Schedule A . Each Schedule B must accurately detail the work to be performed by the MBE or WBE and the agreed rates and prices, and must be completed and signed by the MBE or WBE firm. 3. Letters of Certification: A copy of each proposed MBE's and WBE's current letters of certification (or other ce rtification documents) must be submi tted with the Schedule B. The Park District accepts certification by public or private entities such as the City of Chicago, the Chicago Minority Supplier Development Council [CMSDC ], the Women's Business Development Center [WBDC], or the Small Business Administration [SBA] . The Park District reserves the right to determine that even if an entity is certified, it s inclusion in the Program does not further the Program's purposes. The Park District - not t he bidder - shall determine the adequacy of the letters of certification or other certification documents. a. A receipt for the submittal of an application for certification is NOT AN ACCEPTABLE alternative to a current certification letter. b. The only ACCEPTABLE alternative to a current ce rtification letter is a \"courtesy extension letter\" from the same certifying agency. C. Evaluation of the Schedules If the potential awardee fails to meet the MBE goal and/or the WBE goal and no reduction or waiver was granted before the proposal was submitted; or if the submitter is found to be unresponsive or uncooperative; or if false statements were made in the Schedules; or if the submitter fails to cooperate promptly with the Park Distric t; the submitter may be deemed unresponsive and eliminated from award consideration. IV. CONTRACT PERFORMANCE A. MBE and WBE Utilization Reports The awardee shall maintain records of all relevant data with respect to the utilization of MBEs and WBEs, retaining these records for a period of at leas t three years after expiration of the contract. The awardee shall file quarterly MBE and WBE Utilization Reports . Each MBE and WBE Utilization Report will reflect the current status of current and projected payments to MBEs and WBEs. Such reports shall include the following: the nam e, business address, telephone number and contact person of each MBE and WBE actually involved in t he performance of the contract; a description of the work performed and/or product or service supplied by each MBE or WBE; the date and amount of each payment; and such other information as may assist the Director of Purchasing in determining the awardee's compliance with the provisions of the Program. B. Access to Records During the term of the contract and for a period of three years after the expiration date of the contract, the Director of Purchasing shall have ac cess to the awardee's books and records, including without limitation payroll records, tax returns and records, and books of account, on five business days notice, to allow the Director of Purchasi ng to determine the awardee's compliance with its commitment to MBE and WBE participation and the status of any MBE or WBE performing any portion of the contract. This provision shall be in addition to, and not a substitute for, any other provision allowing inspection of the awardee's records by any officer or official of the Chicago Park District for any purpose. C. Substitution of MBEs and WBEs Listed in the Schedules When the awardee believes it has become necessary to substitute a new MBE or WBE in order to actually fulfill the MBE goal or WBE goal, or to comp lete the work of the contract, the awardee must submit to the Director of Purchasing a written reque st for permission to substitute a different MBE or WBE. Any substitution must receive prior appro val from the Director of Purchasing. If the participation of MBEs and/or WBEs in the contra ct would be reduced by the substitution, the awardee must utilize MBEs and/or WBEs in other ar eas of the contract to meet the MBE goal and/or WBE goal, unless a reduction or waiver is granted. Such a request must include specific reasons for the proposed substitution, including an affidavit fr om the MBE or WBE listed in Schedule A and not utilized, stating why the MBE or WBE is unable to co mplete the work. Acceptable reasons include, but are not limited to, the following: 1. the MBE or WBE was found not to be able to perf orm the work as described in the Schedules, or was not able to perform on time; 2. the MBE or WBE was found not to be able to produce acceptable work; 3. the MBE or WBE was discovered to be improperly certified; or 4. the MBE or WBE later demands an unreasonable escalation of price. The awardee's substitution request should inclu de the names, addresses, and officials of any proposed substitute MBE or WBE and the dollar value and scope of work of the proposed subcontract. Such notification shall also include documents that are require d for the determination of proposal compliance, including the Schedules and cu rrent certification letters. The Park District will not approve extra payment fo r escalated cost s incurred by the awar dee when a substitution becomes necessary for the awardee in order to comply with the MBE goal and/or the WBE goal. V. NON-COMPLIANCE The following constitute material breaches of the cont ract and shall entitle the Park District to declare a default, terminate the contract and exercise those remedies provided for in the contract and at law or in equity: (1) failure to satisfy the MBE goal and/or t he WBE goal required by the contract; or (2) the disqualification of the MBE or WBE when such st atus was a factor in the contract award and was misrepresented by the submitter . A. In the event of an awardee's non-compliance with the commitment to MBE and/or WBE participation, the awardee agrees to pay damages to the MBEs and WBEs that were underu tilized due to no fault of the MBE or WBE. The unexcused reduction of MBE and/or WBE participation in connection with a contract, including any modification thereof, sha ll entitle the affected MBEs and WBEs to damages. The awardee agrees to submit any dispute concer ning such damages to binding arbitration by an independent arbitrator, other than any department or agency of the Chicago Park District, with reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees and costs being recoverable by a prevailing MBE or WBE. B. In the event that an awardee is determined by t he Director of Purchasing not to have been involved in any misrepresentation of the status of a disqualified MBE or WBE included in the Schedules, the Director of Purchasing may allow the awardee to di scharge the MBE or WBE and, if possible, identify and engage a qualified MBE or WBE as a replacement. A MBE must be replaced by another MBE and a WBE must be replaced by another WBE, unless a reduction or waiver is granted. C. If, after notice and a hearing before the Dire ctor of Purchasing, the General Superintendent determines that an awardee or a MBE or WBE has made fraudulent misrepresentations to the Director of Purchasing regarding the utilization of MBEs or WBEs, or has colluded with another making such fraudulent misrepresentations, the aw ardee or MBE or WBE shall be disqualified from contracting or subcontracting on additi onal contracts with the Park Distri ct for a period of three years. D. The consequences provided herein shall be in additi on to any other criminal or civil liability to which such entities may be subject. The General Superintendent, through the General Counsel of the Park District, shall inform the appropriate law enfor cement officers of instances of fraudulent misrepresentation and collusion.
