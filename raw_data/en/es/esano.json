Integr Med Res ; 9(3): 100473, 2020 Sep. covidwho-645131 ABSTRACT BACKGROUND:Due to the [pandemic], there is a significant interest in the [therapeutic] [resources]linked to TCIM to support potentially [therapeutic research]and intervention in the management of [Coronavirus]- 19 (COVID-19). At the date of this evidence map\u00b4s [publication], there is no evidence of specific [treatments]for COVID-19. This map organizes information about symptoms management (especially on dimensions related to [mental health]and mild viral [respiratory infections], as well [antiviral]activity). METHOD:This evidence map applies [methodology]developed by [Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information]based on the 3iE [evidence gap]map. A search was performed in the Traditional, Complementary and [Integrative Medicine] [Virtual Health Library]and [PubMed], using [epidemics], COVID-19 symptoms, non-pharmacological interventions related to TCIM. RESULTS:For the map, 126 systematic reviews and controlled clinical studies were characterized, distributed in a matrix with 62 interventions (18 [phytotherapy], 9 [mind-body therapies], 11 [traditional Chinese medicine], 7 homeopathic and anthroposophic dynamized medicines and 17 supplements), and 67 outcomes (14 immunological response, 23 [mental health], 25 complementary clinical management of the [infection]and 5 other). CONCLUSION:The map presents an overview of possible TCIM contributions to various dimensions of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in the field of [mental health], and it is directed to [researchers]and [health]professionals specialized in TCIM. Most of the [antiviral]activity outcomes described in this map refers to respiratory [viruses]in general, and not specifically to [SARS-CoV-2]( [Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2]). This information may be useful to guide new [research], but not necessarily to support a [therapeutic]recommendation. Finally, any suspicion of COVID-19 [infection]should follow the "}
