Bacillus subtilis, a harmless intestinal commensal, has recently earned a strong reputation as a vaccine production host and delivery vector, with advantages such as low cost, safety for human consumption, and straightforward oral administration. In this study, we have succeeded generating \"S spores\" by engineering B. subtilis with spore coat proteins resembling the spike (S) protein of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. With the addition of two immunostimulating natural products as adjuvants, namely Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bge (AM) and Coriolus versicolor (CV), oral administration of S spores could elicit mild immune responses against COVID-19 infection without toxicity. Mucosal IgA against the S protein was enhanced by co-feeding with AM and CV in an S spores-inoculated mouse model. Faster and stronger IgG responses against the S protein were observed when the mice were fed with S spores prior to vaccination with the commercial COVID-19 vaccine CoronaVac. In vitro studies demonstrated that AM, CV, and B. subtilis spores could dose-dependently activate both macrophages and dendritic cells by secreting innate immunity-related IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-, and some other proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines. In conclusion, the combination of S spores with AM and CV may be helpful in developing a vaccine-like supplement against respiratory infection.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-06-26", "cleaned_text": "Creating a Vaccine-like Supplement against Respiratory Infection Using Recombinant Bacillus subtilis Spores Expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein with Natural Products [https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28134996](https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28134996) [Antibacterial, respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron are now spreading rapidly, possibly due to spike mutations that alter the antibody required by the host, resulting in immune escape [ [5](#B5-molecules-28-04996)]. Interventions are urgently needed to prevent the new emerging variant and/or to treat the disease. Genetic engineering of the spores of Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) has raised interest in vaccine development. The B. subtilis spores are desirable as a carrier for vaccines because the FDA generally recognizes them as safe, and the spores can act as an adjuvant to boost immune response, especially innate immunity [ [6](#B6-molecules-28-04996), [7](#B7-molecules-28-04996)]. B. subtilis has been studied for decades and developed as a bioactive supplement for immunomodulation [ [8](#B8-molecules-28-04996)]. Specific proteins with known targets for the induction of adaptive immune responses can be used as antigens for vaccine development. The ease of administration is another major advantage for the development of oral vaccination against infectious diseases. We have successfully generated B. subtilis spores expressing the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein genetically fused to the surface-exposed spore coat proteins CotC of the B. subtilis spores [ [9](#B9-molecules-28-04996)], and a similar B. subtilis construct has recently been produced by another group [ [10](#B10-molecules-28-04996)]. [11](#B11-molecules-28-04996), [12](#B12-molecules-28-04996), [13](#B13-molecules-28-04996)]. We found that the bioactive polysaccharides isolated from AM and CV exhibited significant immunomodulatory effects by stimulating the proliferation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and enhancing innate properties of AM and CV polysaccharides may promote trained immunity [ [18](#B18-molecules-28-04996)] with a long-term enhancement of innate immune responses and induce heterologous protection against infection. The objectives of this study were to investigate the immunopotentiating effects of B. subtilis spores, AM and CV, by examining the (i) in vitro innate immunity-boosting effects using human macrophages and intestinal HT-29 cells co-culture and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC), (ii) the in vivo oral vaccination-like activities using a mouse immunization model [ [19](#B19-molecules-28-04996), [20](#B20-molecules-28-04996)], and (iii) the use of B. subtilis spores, S spores, AM, and CV as an oral supplement for CoronaVac vaccination. 2. Results 2.1. MTT Cytotoxicity Test [Figure Co-Culture Cells and AM, CV, or spores ( [Figure 2](#molecules-28-04996-f002)). The stimulatory effects of B. subtilis spores were more potent than AM and CV. CV (100-1000 g/mL) produced significantly higher concentrations of IL-1, IL-10, and TNF- when compared to AM. Compared with macrophages and HT-29 culture separately without treatment, the cytokine production profiles were similar to the co-culture of macrophages with HT-29 cells ( [Figure A5](#molecules-28-04996-f0A5)). Results can, therefore, exclude the possibility of the effect of HT29 cells on macrophages in co-culture. [Figure 3](#molecules-28-04996-f003)). Similar co-culture of macrophage and HT-29 cells, the stimulatory effects of B. subtilis spores were more potent than AM and CV. CV (100-1000 g/mL) produced significantly higher concentrations of IL-1, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF- when compared to AM. Taken together, B. subtilis or AM/CV could promote the immune response and has an immune-adjuvant effect on macrophages and DC, which are the principal antigen-presenting cells to B cells for antibody production in humoral immunity. 2.3. Oral Vaccination of B. subtilis Spores, AM, and CV [Figure 4](#molecules-28-04996-f004)a). After oral vaccination 2 times, a small increase in serum IgG titer against the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was observed in mice receiving S protein-engineered B. subtilis together with AM/CV. Very small increases in IgA production (OD 0.05) against the SARS-CoV-2 S protein were detected in the sera of mice from all groups. Adjuvant activities on the serum antibody production were not observed in the groups receiving S spores and co-treated with AM/CV. From the feces collected from different time points ( [Figure 4](#molecules-28-04996-f004)b), significantly higher levels of IgA against S protein were observed from mice fed with S protein-engineered B. subtilis alone, co-treatment with AM/CV compared with PBS group and mice fed only with native spores or AM/CV after first oral vaccination (all p < 0.05). For intestine lavage of the sacrificed mice ( [Figure 4](#molecules-28-04996-f004)c), a stronger IgA secretion against spike protein was observed in the mice from the S spores treatment group when compared with the PBS and AM/CV treatment-only groups, and one mouse produced a strong IgA response against SARS-CoV-2 S protein (OD = 1.4). For the S spores and AM/CV co-treatment group, an enhanced effect on IgA production was observed in all 5 mice (OD ranged from 0.4-1.5). A small but detectable IgM response against the S protein (not statistically significant) was observed in the mice after the first and second oral vaccination with the native or S spores. This may be due to the cross-reactivity between the surface antigens of the spores and the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 S protein. [Figure 5](#molecules-28-04996-f005). In the S spores group, the serum concentration of IL-1 in one mouse was 490 pg/mL, which was 2-fold higher than the PBS group. Overall, a significant increase in IL-1 production was observed in the group of mice treated with S spores only compared to the control group. The increase in cytokine secretion was not observed in the mice treated with S spores and AM/CV. 2.4. Toxicity Studies [Figure 6](#molecules-28-04996-f006)) compared to the PBS group. There was no significant difference in the serum concentrations of liver AST in all treatment groups. It was concluded that the liver functions of the mice were not affected by oral administration of B. subtilis spores, AM, or CV. [Figure 7](#molecules-28-04996-f007). Compared with the non-treated group, inflammatory cell infiltrates, epithelial changes, disrupted epithelial barrier, and alterations in the overall mucosal architecture, presence of ulcerations, granulation tissue, irregular crypts, or crypt loss were not observed in the small intestine of any of the treatment groups. In the liver, hepatocellular morphology was similar in all treatment groups compared with the untreated group. Inflammation, hemorrhage, and architectural disruption of the liver were not observed. In lung tissue sections, the surrounding lung parenchyma was similar in all groups. Only mild infiltration of immune cells was observed in the groups treated with S spores and S spores + AM + CV when compared with the control group, but no bronchial epithelial damage, tissue necrosis, hemorrhage, or lesions were observed in these two treatment groups. 2.5. Adjuvant Effects of B. subtilis Spores, AM/CV on CoronaVac Vaccine [Figure 8](#molecules-28-04996-f008). The antibody levels (IgA, IgM, and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins) of all groups tested were low on Day 1. After the first CoronaVac vaccination, a slight increase in IgM against both N and S proteins was observed in all vaccinated groups with no significant difference (all p > 0.05). For IgG antibodies against the N protein, the activities were low compared to the sera IgG before vaccination. A significant increase in IgG production against the S protein was observed only in the S spores-fed group (p < 0.05), suggesting that oral administration of S spores 14 days before CoronaVac could enhance the production of antibodies against the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. In the mice fed with AM and CV, IgM and IgG antibody activities against both N and S proteins were similar to those in the group that received CoronaVac alone. Notably, one mouse in the AM/CV group produced a relatively higher level of IgA against N protein after the first and second CoronaVac vaccinations. After the second CoronaVac vaccination, higher concentrations of IgG against S protein were observed in all vaccinated groups compared to the serum activities of the corresponding groups after the first vaccination. For N protein, higher levels of IgG against N protein were observed in both the S spores and AM/CV groups compared to the CoronaVac alone group. The mice sera were further tested for neutralizing antibody activities against SARS-CoV-2 using a commercially available SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody ELISA assay ( [Figure 8](#molecules-28-04996-f008)b). After the first vaccination of CoronaVac, a significantly stronger neutralization activity was observed in the S spores-fed group (% neutralization = 22.2%) (p < 0.05) when compared with the other two groups: CoronaVac +AM/CV and CoronaVac only (4% and 6.2%). In summary, a significantly higher concentration of neutralizing IgG against S protein could be induced in mice with CoronaVac vaccination with prior oral administration of S spores. 3. Discussion [21](#B21-molecules-28-04996)]. Previous findings in the field of immune memory have shown that B and T cell-mediated adaptive immunity after infection is enhanced by \"Trained Immunity\" [ [22](#B22-molecules-28-04996)]. This effect has been investigated for the tuberculosis vaccine strain Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) [ [23](#B23-molecules-28-04996)]. Natea developed the concept of \"Trained Immunity\" based on epidemiological observations that people who have received commonplace vaccinations, such as BCG against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, tend to be more resistant to other infections. Using severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice infected with Candida albicans, it was found that they could be protected against reinfection in a monocyte-dependent manner [ [24](#B24-molecules-28-04996)]. It is suggested that this protective effect is mediated by a BCG-induced increase in innate immune cell function with several distinct features, including higher proinflammatory cytokine responses to unrelated secondary pathogens and activation of the innate immune effector cells such as macrophages and DC. This immune process is mediated by transcriptomic and epigenetic changes in myeloid cells, such as monocytes and macrophages [ [25](#B25-molecules-28-04996)]. Monocytes can develop immunological memory, a functional feature widely recognized as innate immune training, to distinguish it from memory in adaptive immune cells. Upon a secondary immune challenge, either homologous or heterologous, trained monocytes/macrophages exhibit a more robust production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-, [ [26](#B26-molecules-28-04996)]. The reprogramming of monocytes leads to increased innate immunity-related cytokine and chemokine production that could be induced by the bioactive -glucans of the fungal cell wall [ [27](#B27-molecules-28-04996)]. [28](#B28-molecules-28-04996)]. DC has also been shown to exhibit immune memory responses [ [29](#B29-molecules-28-04996)]. DCs are the most potent professional antigen-presenting cells involved in the antibody production process. In our study, we have shown that B. subtilis spores, AM, and CV could stimulate DCs, monocytes, and macrophages and chemokines for immunomodulation. The combination of S protein-engineered B. subtilis, AM, and CV may produce better outcomes in developing an oral vaccine-like supplement against COVID-19 by boosting the memory response and immune activities of both monocytes and dendritic cells in innate immunity. [30](#B30-molecules-28-04996)], mice, and guinea pigs [ [19](#B19-molecules-28-04996), [31](#B31-molecules-28-04996), [32](#B32-molecules-28-04996)]. Interestingly, the antibody titers in these published studies were quite similar, and only relatively weak antibody responses were elicited (OD < 1.0). The results of our animal studies with B. subtilis spores expressing S proteins alone were similar to those published. Oral administration of -glucan enriched CV and AM extracts enhanced mucosal IgA production and could not be achieved with either CV or AM alone. In our case, the antibody immune responses elicited by oral vaccination with B. subtilis spores with or without CV/AM extracts against COVID-19 were mild compared to the conventionally used vaccines such as CoronaVac with intramuscular injection. When mice were fed with S spores prior to CoronaVac vaccination, faster and stronger IgG responses to S protein were observed. The immunogenicity of the S spores with or without AM+CV alone may not be strong enough to induce a systemic IgG immune response against the S protein. However, the mucosal immune response induced by S spores could produce a faster and stronger neutralizing IgG response against the S protein prior to vaccination with the commercial COVID-19 vaccine CoronaVac, thereby producing stronger immunogenicity and IgG response against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. [33](#B33-molecules-28-04996)]. In addition to AM/CV, -glucan-enriched yeasts with immunostimulatory properties have recently been tested as a vaccine vehicle and adjuvant. An extended-release vaccine delivery system (GP-diABZI-RBD) consisting of the original SARS-CoV-2 WA1 strain RBD as the antigen and diABZI STING agonist in conjunction with yeast -glucan particles (GP-diABZI) has been tested [ [34](#B34-molecules-28-04996)]. The respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts are the main targets of COVID-19 infection, with 12 to 61% of patients reported to have various gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, direct damage to intestinal mucosal epithelial cells, malnutrition, and intestinal flora disorders [ [35](#B35-molecules-28-04996)]. The mucosal immunity enhanced by our spores, together with -glucan CV and AM enriched, may provide additional protection against the gastrointestinal tract's infection by COVID-19. [9](#B9-molecules-28-04996)] who received oral B. subtilis spores expressing the S protein RBD of SARS-CoV-2 on the spore surface or placebo for three courses on three consecutive days. These participants were vaccinated with either BBIBP-CorV [ [36](#B36-molecules-28-04996)] or BNT162b2 [ [37](#B37-molecules-28-04996)] prior to the clinical trial. In the placebo group, the neutralizing antibody levels gradually declined, whereas the participants receiving the S protein spores showed an increase in neutralizing antibody levels against SARS-CoV-2. No observable local or systemic adverse effects were reported. Apart from the vaccine-like activities, the innate immune-boosting effects of both B. subtilis spores and S spores together with CV and AM may provide protection against various respiratory and intestinal infections. Bacillus-based probiotics have been shown to strengthen the intestinal barrier and limit inflammatory responses, which may indeed improve digestive health [ [38](#B38-molecules-28-04996)]. Recently, Bacillus species have been shown to be a potential source of anti-SARS-CoV-2 major protease inhibitors [ [39](#B39-molecules-28-04996)]. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Preparation of B. subtilis Spores (S Spores) Expressing the Ancestral SARS-CoV-2 RBD of S Protein [Figure A1](#molecules-28-04996-f0A1)). The spore was blocked with 5% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and then stained with rabbit-anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD antibody (1:500 dilution) (Sino Biological, Beijing, followed conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen, Cat. No. R37118, 1:1000). The amount of S protein in the spores was semi-quantified by Western blotting. The spores were lysed with SDS-PAGE buffer and then denatured for 10 min at 100 \u00b0C. After centrifugation at 14,800\u00d7 g for 15 min, spore lysate was analyzed in SDS-PAGE and then blotted with monoclonal antibodies against the RBD of S protein. The S protein RBD standard with known concentrations (0.4, 2, and 10 ng/mL) was used for semi-quantitation (Sino Biological, Beijing, China, Cat. No. 40592-V08B). Native spores of non-transformed B. subtilis were used as the negative control. 4.2. Preparation of the Extract of AM and CV [Figure A2](#molecules-28-04996-f0A2)). The extraction of AM and CV was performed according to the traditional custom of Chinese medicine preparation. Each of the individual herbs was extracted twice by heating under reflux at 100 \u00b0C using 10\u00d7 distilled water for each extraction. The aqueous extracts for each of the individual herbs were then combined individually and filtered using cotton wool. The filtrates were concentrated under reduced pressure at 60 \u00b0C. The concentrated extracts were lyophilized. AM was authenticated using thin-layer chromatography and compared with corresponding chemical markers in accordance with the Chinese Pharmacopoeia [ [40](#B40-molecules-28-04996)] ( [Figure A3](#molecules-28-04996-f0A3)). phenol-sulfuric acid colorimetric method. The polysaccharide content in CV water extract was 8.02 \u00b1 0.21% (w/w). The chemical composition of CV was further analyzed with UPLC-QTOF analysis ( [Figure A4](#molecules-28-04996-f0A4)). A total of 7 compounds were tentatively identified in the CV extracts by UPLC-MS. A total of 3 hydroxybenzoic acids, 2 hydroxycinnamic acids, esculetin, and quinic acid were found. The number of endotoxins present in herbal extracts was quantified with a HEK-Blue LPS Detection Kit 2, InvivoGen, Toulouse, France). The endotoxin levels of AM and CV were 20.1 and 19.2 EU/mL, respectively. As a small amount of endotoxins was present in the herbal extracts, the antibiotic polymyxin B sulfate (10 g/L) [ [41](#B41-molecules-28-04996)] was used in the in vitro studies to neutralize the effect of endotoxins in the herbal extracts. 4.3. 2.3 3-[4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 Intestinal HT-29 Cells and Monocyte Derived Dendritic Cells (DC) Culture 4.5. Immunization Regimens [Figure 9](#molecules-28-04996-f009)). Blood and fecal samples were collected 3 days before the immunization regimen and on days 8, 22, and 38. At the terminal stage, sera and tissues from the mice, including liver, lung, small and large intestine, were collected. The tissues were perfused with 1 mL of 10% neutral-buffered formalin. The tissues were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The stained sections were examined with light microscopy to assess the histopathological changes. To check for any toxic effect on the liver function, the sera of the mice were used to measure concentrations of the liver enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (AST) using an AST Activity Assay Kit from Abcam. Individual sera and fecal samples from each group of mice were tested for antibody response. The collected fecal materials were first lyophilized and stored at 20 \u00b0C until use. Four fecal pellets per mouse were homogenized in 200 L of PBS containing 1% BSA and protease inhibitors. The suspensions were centrifuged (16,000\u00d7 g, 10 min, 4 \u00b0C), and supernatants were collected. The activities of IgM, IgA, and IgG against the spike protein were measured using ELISA coated with the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD-His Tag protein (Sino Biological, Beijing, China, catalog number: 40592-V08B). 4.6. Adjuvant Effects of B. subtilis Spores, AM, and CV on CoronaVac Vaccine [42](#B42-molecules-28-04996), [43](#B43-molecules-28-04996), [44](#B44-molecules-28-04996)]. Whole viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were used for the vaccine, and antibodies against different regions of the viral particle (e.g., nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) proteins) can be induced by the CoronaVac vaccination. To study the adjuvant effects of B. subtilis spores, AM, and CV on the CoronaVac vaccine, sixteen 6-week-old female BALB/c mice were divided into 4 groups: (1) orally fed with S spores (4-day course) 14 days prior to CoronaVac vaccination (50 L) on day 1 and 15; (2) immunized with CoronaVac only; (3) intramuscularly AM (0.74 g/kg) and CV (1.38 g/kg), (days 1-4 PBS ( [Figure 10](#molecules-28-04996-f010)). Individual sera and samples of each mice group were tested for antibody response such as IgM, IgA, and IgG against N and S proteins, as described in [Section 2.5](#sec2dot5-molecules-28-04996). 4.7. Neutralization Assay 4.8. Statistical Analyses 5. Conclusions [33](#B33-molecules-28-04996), [45](#B45-molecules-28-04996)]. Further studies, such as the in vivo functional activities of the macrophages and DC, are needed to clarify these issues before practical use. To enhance the immune response of S spores, increasing the expressions of S proteins in B. subtilis spores or adding multivalent SARS-CoV-2 variants S proteins [ [46](#B46-molecules-28-04996), [47](#B47-molecules-28-04996)] to the spores may further enhance the efficacy of the supplement against the current COVID-19 pandemic. 6.

The medicinal mushroom CV belongs to the group of Basidiomycetes, in which the fruiting bodies are characterized by hymenium (fertile layer) in vertical pores on the underside of the caps. The upper surface of the cap of CV shows typical concentric zones of different colors, such as brown, white, and grey, with overlapping clusters on dead wood. The cap flat is often triangular or round, with zones of fine hairs. The pore surface is whitish or light brown, with round and twisted pores (a). AM was derived from the dried root of Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bge. of the family Fabaceae (Leguminosae). The outer surface was pale brownish-yellow or pale brown with irregular, longitudinal wrinkles or furrows. The texture was hard, tenacious, and uneasily broken. The central part of the old root was occasionally rotten-wood-shaped, blackish-brown, or hollow (b). The extraction of AM and CV was performed according to the traditional practice of Chinese medicine preparation. Each of the individual herbs was extracted twice by heating under reflux at 100 \u00b0C using 10\u00d7 distilled water for each extraction. The aqueous extracts for each of the individual herbs were then combined individually and filtered using cotton wool. The filtrates were concentrated under reduced pressure at 60 \u00b0C. The concentrated extracts were lyophilized. All the extracts (c,d) were stored in desiccators at room temperature before use. The extraction efficiency of herbs refers to the number of water extracts extracted from Chinese medicine relative to the number of extracts in the herbs. The yield of extract (extractable components) expressed on a dry weight basis was calculated using the following equation: Yield (g/100 g) = (W1 \u00d7 100)/W2 where W1 is the weight of the extract residue obtained after water extraction. W2 is the total weight of the original plant. The extraction efficiencies of CV and AM were 9.85% and 39.27%, respectively. References - Callaway, E.
