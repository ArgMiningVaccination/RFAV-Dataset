These are the elements of your immune system which fight disease. The immune system maintains a record of every microbe it's ever defeated, in forms of white blood cells (B- and T-lymphocytes) called memory cells. This means it can recognize and destroy the microbe quickly if it ever re-enters the body, multiply, and make you sick. Some infections, such as flu or the common cold, must be fought many times since so many unique viruses or strains of the identical kind of virus may cause these illnesses. Obtaining a cold or flu from one virus doesn't give you immunity against the others. Your first step in the defense is to choose a healthful lifestyle. Ayurveda brings in many components of a healthy lifestyle. These good health practices can go far in [keeping your immune system strong](https://www.nourishdoc.com/webinars/essential-oils-for-immune-system) and healthy. Trying to boost the cells of your immune system is particularly complicated because there are several different sorts of cells in the immune system which react to so many unique microbes in lots of ways. Which cells should you increase, and to what amount? Thus far, scientists don't know the solution. What is known is that the body is constantly generating immune cells. Certainly, it produces a lot more lymphocytes than it can possibly use. The additional cells eliminate themselves via a natural process of cell death called apoptosis - a few before they see any activity, some after the battle is won. Nobody knows how many cells the ideal mix of cells that the immune system needs to function at its optimal level. How does Ayurveda view immune system? Immune system preventing germs The Ayurvedic theory of immunity is based on maintaining good health in a balanced, holistic sense. It is known as Beej-bhumi, which translates to \"seed and soil.\" The body is the fertile soil on which harmful infection germs may germinate and grow. If our body is out of balance and filled with Ama (the harmful by-products that result from incomplete digestion), viruses and harmful bacteria will discover fertile soil for their development. Ojas is the energy essential for the body and mind obtained from eating pure and nourishing (sattvic) foods. If digestion is healthy, Ojas will predominate in our own body. Contrary to Ama, Ojas has a strengthening effect on your immune system, and when it predominates, the seeds of disease find it difficult to take hold. Immunity due to seasonal changes According to Ayurveda, seasonal changes, say from fall to winter or winter to spring up, are inclined to have a weakening effect on the body, and we become more susceptible to infections, such as respiratory issues. The metabolic and digestive systems function differently in each season. Because of this, during the transition between one season and another, Agni (digestive fire) can fluctuate dramatically. This may cause incomplete digestion and into the build-up of partly digested food or Ama within our cells. If we fail to change our diet and don't follow the suitable Ayurvedic seasonal guidelines, Ama becomes more toxic and efficiently becomes prepared for the rise of diseases. This is the reason why respiratory disorders and allergies abound in the fall and early spring. In the early spring, there is an extra element. As spring progresses, the weather begins to heat up, and any Ama that has accumulated during winter begins to become mobile. This mobile Ama begins flooding our Shrotas (body channels and micro-channels), and this then overloads our immune system. If our immune system isn't so powerful, our body becomes a fertile ground for viruses, harmful bacteria, and allergens.
