You might feel a certain amount of unease or uncertainty when it comes to stressful situations such as taking a test, giving a presentation, or meeting new people. In many cases, a small amount of anxiety every so often can be a good thing. It helps to keep you aware of potential dangers and motivates you to be prepared. For many people, however, anxiety occurs more frequently. They experience it almost every day. [Anxiety disorders](https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/guide/anxiety-disorders#1) such as [generalized anxiety disorder](https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/guide/generalized-anxiety-disorder#1), [panic disorder](https://www.webmd.com/balance/stress-management/rm-quiz-stress-anxiety), or [phobias](https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/specific-phobias#1) can interfere with normal daily activities, affecting their work, home, and personal lives. They differ from regular anxiety in that people feel an excessive amount of fear or anxiousness. Dealing with anxiety can be stressful, but it is treatable. Many people with anxiety find relief with treatment. While some people benefit from taking medication, others find success with natural remedies. Natural Remedies for Anxiety Natural remedies for anxiety are those that don't involve [conventional medications](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/qa/what-is-conventional-medicine) (medicine you get from a doctor or health professional). They include things such as herbs, aromatherapy, and performing certain actions that promote relaxation. Some people with anxiety use natural remedies alongside conventional treatments to find relief. Examples of natural remedies for anxiety include: Exercise isn't just good for your physical health; it's also beneficial for your [mental health](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/default.htm). While the connection isn't well understood, studies do show that exercise can help to alleviate symptoms of anxiety. Getting active helps to take your mind off of the issues bothering you. It also triggers your body to release [endorphins](https://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/qa/what-are-endorphins), which are natural feel-good hormones. Herbal Remedies Several different [herbs](https://www.webmd.com/balance/features/are-herbs-good-medicine#1) and herbal supplements may help alleviate anxiety symptoms, helping you to relax and feel calmer. Some of the more well-known varieties include: [Lavender](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/ss/slideshow-vitamins-lavender-uses) - Lemon balm [Chamomile](https://www.webmd.com/diet/supplement-guide-chamomile#1) [Passionflower](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/passionflower-uses-and-risks) [Kava](https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/news/20090514/kava-for-anxiety-is-short-term-use-safe#1) Studies show that chamomile can help with symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder.

Many people also drink herbal teas to help them relax. Aromatherapy involves the use of [essential oils](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/ss/slideshow-essential-oils) to improve health and overall well-being. Many scents can help to boost your mood, help you relax, and reduce anxiety. There are a few ways you can use essential oils. You can use a diffuser, place a few drops on a lava bead bracelet, or mix your favorite scent in a carrier oil to place on your wrist or neck. Scents to use for anxiety include: - Lavender - Ylang ylang - Grapefruit - Clary sage - Bergamont Hemp-derived CBD oil has risen in popularity in recent years. Unlike [marijuana-derived CBD](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/video/video-cbd-oil), CBD from hemp plants has little (less than 0.3%) to no [tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/cbd-thc-difference#1), the cannabinoid that causes a high. Several studies have shown that CBD can help with many ailments, such as pain, inflammation, [insomnia](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/video/anxiety-stress-insomnia), and anxiety. While research is still in the early stages, studies show that it may have a lot of potential as an alternative anxiety treatment. You can find CBD products in many mainstream stores. There are many options, including: - CBD oil tinctures (liquid drops) - CBD gummies - CBD chocolate and candies - CBD topicals (creams or lotions) Meditation involves the practice of mindfulness. You focus on removing chaotic thoughts from your mind and replacing them with calm. Research indicates that meditation can help to relieve anxiety symptoms, helping you to feel more at ease. [Deep Breathing](https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/guide/understanding-anxiety-treatment#1) Exercises Rapid, shallow breathing is a common symptom of anxiety. Breathing in this manner can increase your heart rate, make you feel dizzy, and may even increase the risk of a [panic attack](https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/ss/slideshow-panic-attack). Deep breathing involves taking deliberately deep and measured breaths to restore normal breathing patterns, which can help to reduce anxiety. Weighted Blankets Research shows that weighted blankets can be beneficial for alleviating symptoms of anxiety. The pressure helps to put your body into \"rest mode,\" reducing those symptoms and preparing your body to rest. These blankets come in many different sizes and weights, enabling you to find what works best for you. Quit Cigarettes and Alcohol Both alcohol and cigarettes may appear to calm your nerves at first. After taking a drink, however, your anxiety may worsen. A cycle can develop, leading to [alcohol dependence](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/ss/slideshow-signs-alcohol-problem). Several studies also show that smoking can worsen symptoms of anxiety. Therefore, it's a good idea to try to avoid drinking or smoking to reduce feelings of anxiety. When to See a Doctor While natural treatments can help with anxiety symptoms, some signs may indicate that you need to call your doctor: - Your anxiety is chronic (long-lasting), and it interferes with your ability to function daily - Your symptoms have persisted for six months or more - You're experiencing physical symptoms such as [rapid heart rate](https://www.webmd.com/heart/ss/slideshow-heart-rate), difficulty sleeping, stomach issues, or chronic fatigue - You're avoiding people or places - You're having thoughts of [self-harm](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/features/cutting-self-harm-signs-treatment#1)or [suicide](https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/depression-recognizing-signs-of-suicide#1) Your doctor may prescribe anti-anxiety medications or refer you to a specialist. In some cases, the natural remedies described above may be used along with more conventional treatments to help you manage your symptoms.
