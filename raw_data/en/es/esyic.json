Holistic health is a natural approach to health, wellness, vitality and longevity. The main goal of holistic health, often referred to as Eastern medicine, Oriental Medicine, Integrative medicine, Functional medicine or alternative medicine is to harmonize the connection between the body, mind, and spirit. When it comes to holistic healthcare, providers of Oriental Medicine look beyond the physical body and aim to address the physical, emotional, social, spiritual, and intellectual health and wellness of a patient using natural healing methods. The goal is to effectively treat the body as a complete system, rather than focusing on only symptoms or a specific troublesome area of a patient's body as is common with Western medicine. What is Western Medicine? According to the [National Health Institute](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/western-medicine), Western medicine is defined as \"a system in which medical providers and other healthcare professionals (such as nurses, pharmacists, and therapists) treat symptoms and diseases using drugs, radiation, or surgery. Also called allopathic medicine, biomedicine, conventional medicine, mainstream medicine, and orthodox medicine. While modern day Western medicine has brought many life-saving advancements to today's healthcare industry; it's focus is often on a patient's specific complaint, treating those set of symptoms or that particular body part in an effort to give their patient the most immediate relief. In doing so, Western Medicine relies heavily on a pharmaceutical approach to achieve the desired results. When treating the body through pharmaceutical approaches the underlying causes may or may not be treated and/or discovered. Health and wellness as a whole is often overlooked and underestimated. What is Eastern Medicine? Eastern medicine, otherwise known as Oriental medicine and sometimes referred to as alternative medicine is a complete medical system spanning over 23 centuries which incorporates ancient knowledge and techniques. Often times, these techniques are combined with modern research to form life-changing protocols to treat both acute and/or chronic disorders. Eastern medicine has been shown to be an excellent tool for preventative health measures as well as an effective tool for treating disorders and imbalances. The goal of Eastern medicine is to restore the body's balance and harmony between the natural opposing forces of yin and yang. Perhaps one of the most well known Eastern medicine techniques is acupuncture. Acupuncture has been shown to help alleviate pain associated with a wide variety of ailments.
