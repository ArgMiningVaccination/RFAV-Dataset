Background: Acupuncture has gained increasing international attention in recent decades. The act of incorporating acupuncture treatment into the routine treatment of COVID-19 in China drove us to review the 100 most influential articles of the last 20 years to learn about the current status and trends of acupuncture. Method: Articles related to acupuncture from January 1, 2001, to July 4, 2022, were searched in the Clarivate Analytics Web of Science Core Collection database. The top 100 most cited publications were selected, and information was extracted. Software such as VOSviewer, GraphPad Prism, Scimago Graphica, and CiteSpace were used to visualize and analyze the extracted data. Result: The 100 most cited articles were identified, with an average of 218 citations (range: 131-625). The majority of the top 100 articles were from the USA (n = 53). The institution that published the most highly cited papers was Harvard University (n = 16). The most influential team was Klaus Linde's group. Pain was the top-ranked journal in terms of the number of publications. The largest clusters for co-occurrence keyword analysis focused on acupuncture and electroacupuncture analgesia and brain imaging responses to acupuncture stimulation via functional MRI. The two highest strength burst keywords were \"randomized controlled trials\" and \"osteoarthritis,\" with \"randomized controlled trials\" being a consistent burst keyword from 2011 to the present. Conclusion: This study provides insight into articles of historical significance in the field of acupuncture through bibliometric analysis. These data should provide clinicians and researchers with insight into future directions related to acupuncture.", "sitename": "Karger Publishers", "date": "2023-06-01", "cleaned_text": "Abstract Background: Acupuncture has gained increasing international attention in recent decades.
