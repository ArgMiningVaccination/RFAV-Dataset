Fact: With natural infection, there is a level of uncertainty on how the antibodies will respond, and immunity is really specific to that particular variant. On the other hand, we do know that the vaccine is very protective for most variants. In most people, getting vaccinated generates a lot of antibodies. Myth: The vaccine will expose me to the virus and could allow me to spreadit to other people. Fact: mRNA and vector-based vaccines do not contain COVID-19, living or dead. They won't give you COVID-19 or cause you to shed the virus to others. Myth: I'm young, healthy, and there's a 99% survival rate \u2014 I don'tneed the vaccine. Fact: The way people respond to COVID-19 is unpredictable, and this includes those who don't knowingly have high-risk conditions.

You don't think you are going to be in an accident, but it's worth wearing so you have protection just in case. Myth: Testing for the COVID-19 vaccine wasn't diverse.

Myth: The COVID-19 vaccine has severe side effects. Fact: All medical treatments have some degree of risk. For vaccines, that risk is typically small, and many vaccineshave mild side effects. With the COVID-19 vaccine, side effects typically occur within two days and are completely over within seven days. It's important to know that risks reported in connection with the COVID-19 vaccine are significantly lower \u2014 and less severe \u2014 than the risks associated with contracting COVID-19 itself. Myth: There's still a chance of getting COVID-19 after the vaccine, so there's no point in getting vaccinated.Fact: No vaccination is 100% effective. However, your chances of getting COVID-19 are much lower after vaccination, and you are much less likely to be seriously ill or have complications after vaccination. This is because your immune system is primed and ready to fight off the virus before it can cause a lot of damage. Myth: I had COVID-19, so I don't need the vaccine.
