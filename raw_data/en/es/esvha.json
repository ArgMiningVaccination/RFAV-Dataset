He is a true Vaidya (Ayurvedic Physician) and his office is peaceful and serene. He has a positive and cheerful disposition and a truly youthful spirit. But don't let his young appearance fool you, he is a true master of his craft and a superb Ayurvedic doctor with a vast amount of ancient wisdom and authentic healing modalities to offer you. Trust that you will be in truly gifted hands with Dr Jay and his staff. Nourish your mind, body and spirit with his light and healing wisdom by making an apt to visit him soon, it will be a life changing decision. Thank you Dr Jay! - 1/2/2023 The staff and doctor at Athreya are amazing. They are always willing to help with scheduling and ordering medications. I have been suffering with pretty bad back & stomach issues and have been feeling better since starting and following the routine. - 1/19/2023 Amazing doctor who has supported me greatly on the path from long covid hell to wellness. Compassionate person and very wise. Big heart. Treatment that works. I am living a vibrant, active life again. I am better than ever. Thank you! - 1/7/2022 I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Jay. I began seeing him for peri menopause symptoms two months ago and am now firmly on the path to wellness. I am so grateful for his soothing and effective treatment. - 5/28/2022 Beware of this so-called Doctor! he doesn't give a damn about your health, I went to him a clearly explained my situation to him saying I can't take any spices and it makes me very sick, he charged me about $500 for a visit and meds and gave me medication that included black pepper and spices that made me worse and when I tried reaching him, his staff ditched me multiple times, her receptionist kept telling me I will tell the doctor and didn't answer my call after a while and I had to call her using a different number when she picked up and surprised and again promised me that doctor will call me back, but he never did. Needless to say I emailed the doctor many times but the only time he answered me was before I go to him for a visit, but never later when I was begging in pain for help (I guess there was no profit for him to answer his emails later) around 6 months later I called his office again and her receptionist was able to get me the doctor, I explained to him what happened and he said yeah I was in India, but this didn't have anything to do, my calls were placed before even he left... then he promised me saying \"sure sure, we can set up a zoom meeting so I can give you more consultation\" guess what? Again, they never reached back to me to share the meeting info. I waited about a year for this, because I didn't want to write this review first, but I had enough, he proved to be a careless doctor that his priority is money, so people deserve to know who is going to be their doctor! don't be fooled by thinking anyone with an Ayurvedic doctor title, knows what he is doing, in reality, maybe less than 5% of Ayurvedic doctors are really knowledgeable! - 8/30/2018First to Review I have met Dr. Jay one year ago today. I was in very bad physical and emotional shape. I was walking with a cane, weighed 250 lbs and could not imagine a future for myself. Today I am in great physical condition. I walk normally, i have lost 40lb and I smile at my future(s).I have great plans and a lot of fun in my life. Thank you Dr Jay for your work, your infinite knowledge, your kindness, your support. Not only are you an amazing Doctor, you are an amazing person. - 12/23/2019 I started seeing Vaidya Jayagopal after western medicine was unable to help me address intensifying and expanding allergies. After 3 months following the treatment plan, I was already experiencing changes. One year later, my allergies are all but gone - I only become symptomatic when I eat certain kinds of foods for too long - and I am so much healthier than I was before. Now, I rarely get sick, my sleep and overall breathing quality has vastly improved, as has my energy, and my body feels stronger. It was a bit challenging to learn this ancient system and way of thinking about food and medicine, but Vaidya Jayagopal is very understanding and supported taking steps as I felt ready, without any pressure or judgement. And the entire staff is warm and thoughtful. I am so grateful! - 11/3/2018 Doctor Jay is a wonderful Ayurvedic practitioner. I've experienced 25 lb weight loss and decrease in sacroiliac pain. Hope to lose another 25lbs and walk pain free in the near future. Thank you Dr. Jay... Namaste !!! - 4/13/2019 An amazing find for health and wellness in Long Beach! I went to Athreya Ayurvedic Integravive Health Clinic to find relief from hot flashes and claustrophobia without using pharmaceuticals. I recieved individual treatment for my issues and found the results affirming that health can be approached in an alternative way. I no longer suffer from hot flashes or claustraphobia! Dr. Jay took the time to explain how Ayurveda can help my body and mind be balanced, with diet, lifestyle and herbs, to help maintain health and build immunity to help ward off problems. Dr. Jay's knowlege about how the body functions and his compassiate manner combine to make a true healing environment. I would highly recommend to anyone seeking integrative approaches to health to come to the clinic. - 10/11/2019 Athreya Ayurvedic Integrative Health Center (AAIHC) and Vaida Jayagopal (Dr. Jay) have been great blessings over the last 12 months. I started with nutritional modifications to assist health concerns, added specific therapeutic treatments for ailing body parts, and have recently finished Panchakarma, an Ayurvedic method of detoxing, to work on a chronic medical issue. Panchakarma is mind-boggling in the greatest way imaginable. My allopathic physicians as well as family and friends are amazed at the changes in my health, well-being, and body composition over the course of the last year. There are many other healing practices offered by AAIHC which I look forward to trying. Expect a very positive, karma-zen experience from the moment you walk through the doors. Namaste.
