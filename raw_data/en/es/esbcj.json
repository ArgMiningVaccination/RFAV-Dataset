Its aims are to treat the whole person and restore the balance between the physical, emotional and mental aspect of the individual rather than specific symptoms in isolation. Acupuncture brings the body back to a state of equilibrium by the insertion of very fine needles just beneath the body's surface into acupuncture points. These points are situated along the meridian channels/ energy channels which then effect and stimulate the systems of the body. The energy channels circulate throughout the body and connect to all the organs, like a network of river and streams. When harmonised, the channels flow freely but when there is disturbance they can cause blockages and a disruption in the flow of energy in the channels that result in symptoms. "}
