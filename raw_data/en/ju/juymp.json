Answer our questions and find out if your flexibility is compromised. [Find out how flexible you are](/health/muscles-joints/how-flexible-are-you/) Treating fibromyalgia can be difficult because no one is really sure what causes it. As there is no root cause to treat, it is often necessary to simply manage the symptoms. In this blog post, I talk you through some of the common symptoms of fibromyalgia, as well as the natural and herbal remedies available to ease them. This blog will look at how natural remedies can help treat the common symptoms of fibromyalgia which are: You may experience all of these symptoms, some of them, or perhaps you have different symptoms altogether. For some people, these symptoms are present every day, whilst for others, they will come and go. This is not to mention the fact that symptoms can vary in intensity each day. Now you know why it is so frustrating for you and your doctor when trying to diagnose this condition! So, let's take a closer look at the problem to get a better understanding of it. It isn't clear why fibromyalgia affects some people and not others; however, studies are clear that it appears to affect more women than men.1 It has also been suggested that high stress levels, poor eating habits and sleep problems can all contribute to its onset. [Many fibromyalgia sufferers experience sleep problems](/health/muscles-joints/fibromyalgia/symptoms/sleep-problems/), plus pain can make it more difficult to switch off at night. Whilst you are asleep the body undergoes many restorative processes, meaning that if you fail to get a good night's sleep, these can't happen. This may help explain why people who sleep badly have also been known to feel more pain. One of the most common symptoms of fibromyalgia is [widespread pain](/health/muscles-joints/fibromyalgia/symptoms/pain/). This might be a deep throbbing ache, a stabbing pain, or a burning sensation. It can be felt throughout the body but is often concentrated in certain areas, such as your neck or back. The pain can often affect a sufferer's ability to carry on with day-to-day tasks. When diagnosing fibromyalgia most doctors rely on locating [pain trigger points](/health/muscles-joints/fibromyalgia/trigger-points/) on the body. As well as having a number of physical symptoms associated with it, fibromyalgia is also linked to several emotional symptoms, including [stress ](/health/stress-anxiety-low-mood/stress/)and [anxiety.](/health/stress-anxiety-low-mood/anxiety/) There is a lot of worry around fibromyalgia, especially as it is a relatively unexplained condition. This worry can then lead to anxiety, which is often increased by stressful situations, or the stress of dealing with troublesome symptoms. These emotional responses have also been linked to increased nerve responses to stimuli, including touch. This makes those with fibromyalgia hypersensitive to physical sensations, particularly pain. Additionally, anxiety can cause muscle tension, resulting in tenderness and pain. Stress, meanwhile, can cause poor sleep. All of this can impact the many physical symptoms of fibromyalgia. People with fibromyalgia often experience fatigue and find that they get tired easily. People suffering from fibromyalgia can experience a whole variety of [digestive problems](/health/muscles-joints/fibromyalgia/symptoms/digestive-problems/), including bloating, excess wind, stomach pain, diarrhoea and constipation. These symptoms can often be diagnosed as [ Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).](/health/digestive-system/ibs/) Those with fibromyalgia often find it difficult to concentrate and can have trouble remembering things or learning new things. This ['fibro-fog' ](/health/muscles-joints/fibromyalgia/symptoms/fibro-fog/)can lead to frustration, increasing stress and anxiety levels. People with fibromyalgia tend to suffer from three different types of [headache](/health/muscles-joints/fibromyalgia/symptoms/headaches/): muscle tension headaches, migraines and combination headaches. Headaches can make fibromyalgia even harder to deal with. As, aside from being very painful, headaches can also cause even more problems with concentration (fibro-fog), sleep and difficulty controlling emotions. [Fibromyalgia can make your joints feel stiff](/health/muscles-joints/fibromyalgia/symptoms/stiffness/) and it is often at its worst in the morning. This makes it difficult to get going for the day ahead as movement can be uncomfortable and sometimes painful. [Sensitivity to bright light, noise, tastes and smells are common among fibromyalgia sufferers.](/health/muscles-joints/fibromyalgia/symptoms/sensory/) It is thought that the pain associated with fibromyalgia occurs because of over-activity in the sensory receptors, so it is likely that, for this reason, other senses become more alert and responsive too. Identify what's causing your sensitivity and manage it - keeping a diary could help as you can note down when you experience sensitivities and, if possible, what has caused them. This can help identify ways to handle your sensory overload. For example, you may need to start wearing sunglasses if you find lights too bright or avoid strong smells from air fresheners and scented candles if these prove too much. 1 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6425926/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6425926/) 2 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3165132/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3165132/) Originally published 21 October 2015 (updated 13 May 2020) [Looking for a solution to to help relieve symptoms such as muscle and joint pain, backache, rheumatic pain and lumbago?](/herbal-remedies/devils-claw-atrosan/) Buy now from your local store. \"I have used these for several years and would not wish to be without them.\" To find local independent stores in your area that sell Atrosan Devil's Claw tablets, simply type your postcode below.
