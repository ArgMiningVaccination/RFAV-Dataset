However, we are in the world but not of it and with Jesus all things are possible to those who believe. In these 6 videos and one picture below you will see his motor skills catching up to his abilities once the demonic oppression was removed. People say that the cause of autism in the natural is typically vaccinations but what these do primarily is to weaken the immune system to allow an opportunity for the enemy to attack the body by oppression. Most forms of sickness are literally demonic oppression. How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him. Acts 1038 In the case of autism, it oppresses the child's neurological and motor skills development. So once you cast out the oppressor, the child's neurological and motor skills need to catch up to their age. This is why, once prayed for, you must treat the child as already healed. Not only because he or she is already healed by the stripes of Jesus (1 Peter 2:24) but he or she will naturally rise to your level of expectation of them as you speak and act their healing into manifestation. Yes, this takes patience. A lot of patience. If they never ate with a spoon before, you give them the spoon and tell them to eat and mirror it in front of them. And keep doing it until they catch on. Even if they throw the spoon and make a mess, over and over again, you keep doing it until they get it. And when they get it, you don't make a big deal about it. You may be rejoicing in your heart and want to scream it from the rooftops for joy, but you keep it in especially in front of them because this is normal behavior. You never use the word autism ever again and certainly never in front of them. They are already healed and their skills are catching up to them. This is now the new normal. Here is his mother's testimony: \"My son Kowshik is diagnosed with autism. Kowshik was zero in writing he can simply trace the letters but he can't make proper letters in writing. Praise Jesus there is lot of changes. After we started to pray within a week he started to ride bicycle. Kowshik was not able to express what he thinks and desires but now started to respond and talk. Now he understands and started to do mathematics. I give praise and thanks to the Lord Jesus and Brother Frank for his prayer and guidance. and we thank Sister Presanna Martin also for her continual prayer support. Praise Jesus!\" Kowshik's videos: Praise Jesus! Franciscus M.
