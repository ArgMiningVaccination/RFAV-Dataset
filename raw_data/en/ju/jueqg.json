Students and travelling Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners used this 'Deluxe' kit. It contains equipment needed during moxibustion therapy. Moxibustion is a therapeutic technique used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Acupuncture points are stimulated by applying burning moxa. Moxa is formed from the plant Artemisia vulgaris when dried. It is applied directly to the skin or burned on the head of an acupuncture needle in a combination therapy. The kit contains three grades of raw moxa and equipment for direct (on the skin) and indirect (above the skin) treatment. 'Punk' sticks are pre-rolled compacted moxa sticks for direct application. The metal moxa caps are receptacles for burning moxa slightly above the skin. Moxibustion is believed to stimulate the flow of the life force known as qi (chi) around the body. Qi is considered essential for wellbeing and health. "}
