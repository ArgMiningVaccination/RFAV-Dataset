Fischer Words from the Chairman When I came to the Beth Israel Deacone ss Medical Center (BIDMC) four and a half years ago, I had in mind to rebuild the Department of Surgery into an academically-oriented Department. As many of you are aware, such rebuilding involved, first and foremo st, staffing the Department with individuals to provide extraordinary patient care. I continue to be dedicated to this effort, which remains the hallmark of both the current (BIDMC) and the previous (University of Cincinnati) Departments of Surgery that I had the privilege to lead. However, an academ ic Department of Surgery also has another component, which is the pursuit of knowledge that is obtained by bench as well as by clinical research. I set a number of goals for Research in the Department of Surgery when I came to Boston. The first goal was that we would grow our research programs and increase our NIH funding to climb from, I think, number 16 or 17 in the country, to one of the top 5 Surgery Departments in total research support. This goal is difficult to quantify because the rankings are for combined Departments within a University and not for individual Departments, like the situation we have here at Harvard. Although the ranking of BIDMC in total NIH-funded research is not presently known, what I do know is that we have grown substantially in the past years with the addition of new surgeons and investigators that are involved in basic and clinical research. Another goal I set concerning research was that each Division should have an NIH-funded laboratory, something which we are well on the way to achieving. So, how are we doing in funding our basic and clinical res earch programs? I am pleased to say that our research holdings from the NIH have continued to grow each year. Last year we saw almost an 8% increase in NIH funding, which followed on the heels of a 13.4% increase in 2004, and a 22.5% increase in 2003. The total awarded funds for research last year, as you will see fr om the chart included in the report from Surgical Research that includes both NIH and non-NIH funding, was about $12.6 million dollars. Since 2001 when I arrived at BIDMC, this represents a 23% increase in total funds awarded to our research pr ograms in Surgery! Having productive and well-funded research laboratories in Surgery is an important part of our residency program too, so that our residents can go into the laboratory and carry-out first-class research with memb ers of the Department of Surgery. Hence, we have gone a long way toward fulfilling our goal of sustained growth in research, both at the departmental and divisional levels, which could only be realized by the hard work and dedication of our research faculty, staff, and fellows over the past four and a half years. I wish to thank all of the Division Chiefs and members of the Department, faculty and sta ff alike, for their continued superb efforts in making the Department of Surgery at the Beth Israel D eaconess Medical Center a true academic Department. My thanks are also extended to Drs. Per- Olof Hasselgren and Susan Hagen for putting together this book, and for their continued efforts to build and promote an especially strong academic program in Surgery. Josef E.

Our respon sibilities include assisting in the process of submission of grant applications and interaction with the BIDMC Office of Sponsored Programs. 2) Management of research space, including laboratory and office space, and shared research equipment. For this, we oversee the allocation of research space within the Depa rtment, maintain shared tissue culture facilities, and repr esent the Department at ReAc space sub-committee meetings. 3) Organizing monthly Surgical Research seminars. 4) Preparing the Department of Surgery Annual Research Report. 5) Organ izing laboratory and shared equipment maintenance and telecommunications. 6) Supporting a nd mentoring junior faculty in the establishment of research laboratories. 7) Interacting with and providing informati on to Surgical Residents who plan to spend time in the research laboratory. 8) Obtaining visas for foreign scholars in Research and in preparing application for HMS appointments (Research Fellow-Instructor) to Harvard Medical School. 9) Making recommendations concerning research faculty appointments (Assistant-Full Professor) and reappointments in Surgery. 10) Assisting with the development of existing and new research areas within the Department of Surgery, including both short- and long-term strategic planning and recruitment. Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2005 Division of Surgical Research 2 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center The Division of Surgical Research is headed by Per-Olof Hasselgren, MD, PhD, who is the Vice Chairman for Research in the Department of Surgery. Susan J. Hagen, PhD, is Associate Director. Dr. Hagen works closely with Dr. Hasselgren to accomplish the goals and mission for the Division. Andrew French is the Adm inistrative Coordinator for Surgical Research. Andrew provides admi nistrative support for the Division, under the supervision of Dr. Hagen. The Division of Surgical Research works closely with Research Administration Team 5, headed by Jennifer Sabbagh. Ruth Coburn and Jennifer Clark-Croes are Senior Research Administrators, and William Decaneas and JeeSoo Erickson are Research Administrators in Team 5. The Team 5 staff is responsible for pre-award grant assistance, post-award grant management, research-related purchases, compliance, staff payroll, and the management of new hires for research in Surgery. Research Activity (Funding) for Fiscal Year 2005 Although it may be debated how the success and progress of a research prog ram should be monitored, external funding is one tangible measure of the vitality of research. Based on that criterion, research programs in the Department continue to be successful. External research funding in the Departme nt of Surgery increased by 0.5% from $12,553,220 in fiscal year (FY) 2004 to $12,622,9 77 in FY05 (Figure 1). This increase in total funding includes a significant, 7.4%, increase in NIH funding in FY05 (Figure 2). Approximately 79% of the awarded funding in FY05 was from federal sources, primarily from th e NIH, and 21% from Other Sponsors. Again this year, there were numerous awards for clinical trials, which was about 7% of total funding for research in Surgery. It should also be noted that sinc e 2002, NIH funding in Surgery has increased by 23% (Figure 2). 2002 2003 2004TOTAL AWARDED DOLLARS (IN MILLIONS) 02468101214 $9,714,965$11,819,036 Fiscal Year$12,553,220 2005$12,622,977* *Estimated from expended total of $10,784,756 *Estimated from expended total of $8,496,7042002 2003 2004 Fiscal AWARDED DOLLARS (IN MILLIONS) 0246810 $6,005,4407.4% $9,199,450* $8,490,928 $7,352,53123% Figure 2 Summary of total awarded funds from the NIH from FY02-FY05.

Andrew French Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2005 Division of Surgical Research Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 3 Nine Divisions contributed to the resea rch effort in Surgery in FY05 and 7 have significant ex ternal funding (Figure 3). General Surgery and Transplant Surgery Divisions continue to be the largest with $3.4 million each in total research funding (Figure 3). Urology and Vascular Surgery each contribute about $1.5 million and Cardiothoracic and Podiatry each contri bute about $1 million to total research funding (F igure 3). The Department of Surgery also holds 2 active NIH training grants, one in Cardiovascular Surgery (Dr. Sellk e) and one in Vascular Surgery (Dr. LoGerfo). Investigators in Surgery at BIDMC also actively participate in the GI Surgery Training grant held at Brigham and Women's Hospital (Dr. Soybel). An additional NIH training grant for Surg ery at BIDMC, submitted by the Transplant/Immunobiology Program (Dr. Hanto), is pending. Research Facilities and Space This year, research in the Department of Surgery occupied appr oximately 32,000 square feet of laboratory space including wet labs, special purpose rooms (cold rooms, tissue culture rooms, and shared equipment rooms), and office space. Surgery (basic) research space included (in square feet) 8,139 at HIM, 12,556 in Dana/Research West, 917 in Slosberg-Landy, 1,664 at 21 -27 Burlington Avenue, and 5,322 at Research North. Clinical research in Surgery included (in square feet) 44 3 in Palmer and 1,982 in Feldberg. Th e greatest numbers of researchers were located on the 7th and 8th floors of the Dana/Research We st building on the East Cam pus, where General Surgery, Cardiothoracic Surgery, Ne urosurgery, and Urology re search laboratories are located. Vascular Surgery, Cardiothoracic Surgery, and Urology laboratories are located on the 1st and 10th floors of the Harvard Institutes of Medicine. Research related to Transplanta tion/ Immunobiology is located on the 3rd floor of Research North and 10th floor of the Harvard Institutes of Medicine. Finally, Surgical Nu trition research laboratories are located at the Burlington Avenue building and the Clinical Nutrition laboratories on Feldberg 8. Podiatry's clinical research effort remains in Palmer. Research Seminars The Division of Surgical Research offered a seminar series with presentations from investigators within the Department of Surgery, from other Departments at BIDMC, and from other local institutions. Again this year, seminars were designed with a programmatic theme, with seminars each from Vascular/Cardiovascular, Transplant, Muscle Wasting and Metabolism, Epithelial Biology, and Ur ology. A summary of seminars that were presented in 2005 are listed in Table 1. Table 1.

Faculty Accomplishments During 2005, research in the Department of Surgery wa s conducted by 48 faculty, 24 postdoctoral research fellows, 6 surgical residents, 28 research associates and assistants, 1 visiting scientist, 3 nurses, 1 dietitian, 1 medical writer, and 16 undergraduate, graduate, and me dical students. Numerous research coordi nators, administrative assistants, and administrative coordinators provided important admi nistrative support for research-related efforts in Surgery. The details of staffing for research in Surgery accompany each Divisional report. Many new grant applications were funded in 2005. New NI H grants, in the R01, R03, and R21 categories were awarded to Drs. Blackburn, Zhou, and Gaston. New research grants from other sources were awarded to Drs. Gaston and Veves. Drs. Levitsky and Sellke also successfully renewed their long-standing R01 grants. Ms. Anne Warren, an HMS medical student, received the prestigious Doris Duke Clinical Research Fellowship to work for 1 year with the Plastic and Reconstructive Division. Grants activity for new investigators also increased in 2005, with Drs. Archer, Parangi, and Bai submitting firs t-time R-category grant applications. Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2005 Division of Surgical Research 6 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center In 2005, many faculty members in Surgery were also active in national service. Drs. Hagen (GMPB) and Otterbein were appointed to NIH study sections and seve ral faculty in Surgery served on ad hoc NIH study sections including Drs. Blackburn, Zhou, Hasselgren, Gaston, Ferran, and Veves. Drs. Ferran, Otterbein, Veves also reviewed grant applications for the Juvenile Diabet es Foundation and for the American Diabetes Association. Dr. Olumi reviewed grant applications for the DOD and Dr. Zhou reviewed grant applications for the Natural Science Foundation of China. In 2005, Dr. Veves continued to be a journal editor for Wounds-A Compendium of Clinical Research and Practice and Dr. Olumi served on the editorial board of the Journal of Urology and for Investigative Urology. Dr. Blackburn was an associate editor for Obesity Research and on the editorial board for the journal Obesity Management. Dr. Slav in was an associate editor for the British Journal of Plastic Surgery. In the national and in ternational arena, Surgery facu lty members were invited speakers around the world, from Israel (Slavin, Borud, Contreras, Lee) to the UK (Veves) to Belgiu m (Hasselgren), to Stockholm (Otterbein) to Brazil (Ferran) to India (Das). Dr. Levitsky delivered the presti gious William W.L. Glenn Lecture in Cardiac Surgery at the 2005 annual meeting of the AHA. Dr. Borud was f eatured nationally on Dateline NBC and Drs. DeWolf and Slavin were highlighted in Boston Magazine's list of the Best Doctors. Many honors we re also bestowed-upon the faculty in Surgery this year. Dr. Sanda was the recipient of the Young Investigators Award from the Society of Urological Oncology and Dr. Olumi received the same award from the Society of Basic Urology. Drs. Archer and Parangi were elected to the Surgical Biology Club and Dr. Jones received the 2005 James IV Fellowship, providing travel funds to deliver lectures on minimally invasi ve surgery in the UK, Chin a, and Australia. Dr. Borud was admitted to the NE Society of Plastic Surgeons and Dr. Das was elected Vice-chair for the Committee on Young Surgeons at the American College of Surgeons. Dr. Bach received an honorary Doctor of Medicine degree from the University of Vienna. Researchers in Surgery also continued a strong commitment to teaching. This includes acting as mentors in the NIH in-service teacher program, MIT Bioengin eering Undergraduate Research Program, Biomedical Science Careers Program, Project Success, Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program, and Research Scholars Institute Summer Program. The Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Division continues to be actively involved in the William J von Leibig research training program for both medical and postdo ctoral students. At Harvard Medical School, many investigators in Surgery teach in the Body, Cell Biology, Pharmacology, and/or GI Pathophysiology courses and nearly all of the Surgeons participate in the surgical clerkships. Dr. Jones was Course Director for the MIS course series and laboratory. Bibliography (January - December 2005) The second means by which we monitor the success and progress of our research program is by productivity in terms of publications. Based on this second criterion, research programs in the Department also continue to be successful. In 2005, a total of 95 original articles were published and 52 articles were submitted or accepted for publication by faculty members in the Department of Surge ry. This represents a 38% increase in published original articles and a 73% increase in submitted/accepted articles when compared to the previous year. The number of Reviews, Chapters, and Editorials was high again this year at 98 published or in press articles. Contributions to Books, Monographs, an d Textbooks, as well as to Clinical Communications, Educational an d Non-Print Materials, and Abstracts were also high again this year. Below is a listing, in alphabetical or der, of articles published by researchers in the Department of Surgery in 2005. Bold represents research Faculty in Surgery at BIDMC.

Henry Ellis Jr, MD, PhD Basic Research A tumor suppressor gene, p27, controls progression of cells from the G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. It is reduced or absent in resected specimens from patients with Barrett's Associated Aden ocarcinoma (BAA). This loss of p27 is correlated with tumors of high grade, with increased depth of invasion, greater lymph node involvement, and a decreased postoperative survival rate. These findings influenced us to develop an experimental mouse model of BAA by performing an esophagojejunostomy, to promote reflux of alkaline and acid juices into the esophagus, along with the administration of a carcinogen (N- methyl N-benzylnitrosamine). Subsequently, we showed that malignant transformation of the esophageal mucosa was enhanced in p27 knockout (KO) mice, but could be reduced by administration of flavopiridol, a CDK inhibitor, as a chemopreventive agent.

Flavopiridol combined with gemcitabine (Gem) were administered to mice four months after esophagojejunostomy and carcinogen administration. Results of these showed a si gnificant difference from the diluent (Contr ol) group. We are currently adding two new groups of mice: one treated with flavo and the other with Gem alone.

McCully, PhD The primary focus of the laboratory is to elucidate the mechanis ms and subcellular localization of biochemical and molecular events contributing to myocardi al cell death. In particular, we are interested in the discriminant and/or coordinate contribution of necrosis and apoptosis to myocardial cell death. Study designs utilize models of stunning and ischemia/reperfusion injury in the isolated Langendorff perfused rabbit and the in situ blood perfused pig heart to determine the relative contribution of these pathways in the aged as compared to the mature cardiac surgical patient. The laboratory is also involved in the isolation and identification of genes associated with myocardial ischemia/reperfusion amelioration using differential display, selective subtraction hybr idization, and microarray technology. For this, we use rabbit and pig heart cDNA libraries constructed in our laboratory and non-redundant cDNA's isolated, sequenced and pu tatively identified by our laboratory for microarray analysis. Current research areas involve identification of mitochondrial changes in morphology, function, respiration, volume and DNA integrity in association with intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic and necrotic myocardial cell death following ischemia and reperfusion. In addition studies are underway to the identify mitochondrial ATP- sensitive potassium channel regulation of apoptosis and necrosis in the blood perfused pig heart model of acute myocardial infarction; and the role of STAT1/STAT2 signal transduction in myocardial preservation. These studies includ e comparison between mature and aged populations and differential gender response. Current Employee Erin E.

McCully, PhD Collaborating Investigator: Sidney Levitsky, MD DIVISIONAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS OVER THE PAST YEAR Individual Accomplishments In the past year we have constructed rabbit heart cDNA lib raries and have isolated a nd 5' sequenced 8647 rabbit cDNAs and have identified and stored 2592 non-redundant cDNAs with a mean insert size of 1.67 kb. These non-redundant cDNAs have been used to constr uct rabbit heart microarrays to allow for the parallel determination of multiple gene products and relative mRNA abundance levels and the identification of the co- regulated genes and the functionally related gene groups associated with global ischemia and the enhanced cardioprotection afforded by cardiople gia in the mature and aged male and female heart. This work was performed as current human and mouse cDNA libraries did not allow for anal ysis with the rabbit heart owing to differences in 3' untranslated regions. MitochondrionDepartment of Surgery Annual Research Report 2005 Division of Cardiovascular Surgery 26 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center We have also developed an isolated perfused mouse he art model for use with wild type and knock-out mouse models. Current studies include electro-mechanical changes and reduction and redistribution of gap junction and adherens proteins during ischemia/reperfusion injury and the effects of cardioplegia. Age and gender studies have been performed and will continue using mature and aged orchidectomized male rabbits and appropriate shams and ov ariohysterectomized female rabbits with appropriate shams and hormone replacement therapy along with de n ovo RNA and protein synt hesis inhibition. These studies are designed to utilize microarray technology to identify specific up an d down regulated RNA's and functionally related gene groups modulated by global ischemia and by cardioplegia with gender and with age. It is expected that these studies will allow for the development of gender and age specific cardioprotective protocols using specific hormonal (17 -estradiol, testosterone) or molecular biological techniques which will allow for the short-term activation or suppression of RNA transcripts and provide for enhanced post-ischemic recovery following cardiac surgery. The ability to specifically modify the functional and biochemical response for the male and female mature and aged heart through the directed specific activation or suppression of RNA transcripts will ultimately enhance the ischemic tolerance and reduce morbidity and mortality in human cardiac surgery with specific benefit being expected in the aged female cardiac surgical patient.

This work is of significant clinical and societal importance since colon can cer is the third most common cancer, and the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S.A. Although both environmental and genetic factors play a role in its genesis, environmental factors appear to predominate in importance. Butyrate, a product of fiber fermentation in the colon, is known to inhibit colon carcinogenesis and col on cancer cell growth both in vivo and in vitro . Cell growth occurs through cell cycle progression and cell cycle progression is controlled by a variety of protein cyc lins and their associated kinases. These complexes are inhibited by small proteins, e.g. p21, which cause growth arrest. Our laboratory has shown that butyrate mediates this inhibition of colon cancer cell growth in vitro via transcriptional induction of the cell cycle inhibitor, p21. We have further defined the molecular mechanisms which are involved in the transcriptional induction of p21 by butyrate both in vitro and in vivo . In addition, we have expanded the scope of this work to include examination of other cell cycle regulators, such as cyclin B1. Cyclin B1 is a cell cycle promoter which is increased in colon cancer cells and we are now actively involved in studies which address the regulation and importance of this cell cycle gene product in colon cancer cell growth as well as its regulation by butyrate. Our long-term goal is to continue to advance the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in butyrate's (and fiber's) protection against colon carcinogenesis. My e xpectation is that we will eventually be able to translate these findings into diagnostic and therapeutic strategies against colon cancer.

Blac kburn, MD, PhD Jin-Rong Zhou, PhD Section of Surgical Nutrition- Center for the Study of Nu tritional Medicine (CSNM) Nutrition Metabolism Laboratory (NML) Clinical Research (C enter for the Study of Nutrition Medicine) The Center for the Study of Nutrition Medicine (CSNM), directed by Dr. Blackburn, has 30-years of extensive experience conducting longitudinal studies particularly in multi-center settings. The CSNM is particularly well- equipped with the infrastructure to develop clinical investigation and outcomes assessment and provides sophisticated, scientific nutrition interventions that are utilized to s upport research, training and patient care in many disease states. The CSNM mission is in line with the medical center's \"bench-to- bedside\" mission. Last February, the CSNM released a mul tidisciplinary evidence-based report on best practices in weight loss surgery\u2014the findings of an expert panel sponsored by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health's Betsy Lehman Center for Patient Safety and Medical Error Reduction. Publication of this repo rt put Massachusetts at the forefront of an accelerating national trend to impose standards an d safeguards on the practice of bariatric surgery, a specialty that has grown in the U.S. from approximately 16,000 procedures a year in the early 1990s to more than an estimated 140,000 in 2004. In Massachusetts, the number of weight loss surgeries increased from 148 in 1996 to 3,036 in 2004, raising concerns about patient safety. The Lehman Center addressed these c oncerns by bringing together obesity experts and allied health professional from more than 80% of the sites pe rforming weight loss surgery in the Commonwealth. Together they developed in-depth recommendations and guidelines based on a model of evidence-based medicine similar to that used by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force a nd the National Institutes of Health. Their findings have informed health care policy and had far-reaching effects on both state and national levels. To date, the report has been posted on the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) website, adopted by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, applied as a standard by the state's Board of Registration in Medicine, and used as the blueprint for the American College of Surgeons (ACS) Bariatric Surgery Center Network Accreditation Program. Other professional groups, including the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) and the American So ciety of Bariatric Surgeons (ASBS), have joined the ACS in launching similar programs. So have many managed care companies and third party payers, including: Aetna, Kaiser Permanente, Cigna, the California Associa tion of Health Plans, Health America, and Blue Cross Blue Shields in South Dakota, Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Idaho. These efforts mark a turning point in the practice of we ight loss surgery, away from patchwork reporting and performance analysis and toward a national network of prosp ective, clinically-derived databases that can serve as a vehicle for quality improvement, much like current systems for coronary artery bypass graft surgery established by the Society for Thoracic Surgeons. The lone surgeon in bariatrics has given way to the multidisciplinary team involving nurse practitioners, triage nurses, dietitians, on-call expert consultants, and administrative support staff. In the last 10 years, weight loss surgery has become mainstreamed into the disc ipline of surgery, medical practice in general, and public awareness. In the coming years, quality assurance will be mainstreamed into bariatric surgery to ensure the delivery of appropriate , safe, and effective care. Basic Research (Nutrition Metabolism Laboratory) The Nutrition Metabolism Laboratory (NML), directed by Dr. Joe Zhou, studies the effects of dietary and nutritional components, such as soy phytochemicals, tea polyphenols, and other dietary/herbal supplements, on the prevention and treatment of cancer and obesity, an d to elucidate the underlying molecu lar and cellular mechanisms. The NML is particularly interested in the in vivo evaluation of preventive activities of bi oactive components in soy, tea, and other plant compounds by application of clinically relevant orthotopic and transgenic mouse tumor models. The NML has a particular interest in studying the molecular mechanisms by which dietary bioactive components Dr. Geor ge BlackburnDepartment of Surgery Annual Research Report 2005 Division of General Surgery 38 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center modulate cell proliferation, apoptosis, and tumor angiogenesis. We also investigate the effect of a novel daidzein-rich isoflavone-aglycone extract from soy germ fermentation with Koji fungus ( Aspergliius awamori ) on the prevention of obesity and inflammation. We are further isolating and identifying other bioactive components in soy and tea that may be responsible for their cancer prevention activity. Collaborative research with the investigators inside and outside the BIDMC involves studies in hormone-independent prostate cancer (Steve Balk, Department of Medicine, BIDMC), in the effect of adiponectin on breast cancer (Christos Mantzoros, Department of Medicine, BIDMC), in the protective role of L-glutamine on gastric atrophy and cancer progression during H. pylori infection (Susan Hagen, Department of Surgery, BIDMC), the effect of diet/nutrition on pancreatic cancer (Sareh Parangi, Department of Surgery, BI DMC), in molecular mechanism studies of prostate cancer progression modulated by dietary components (Sandra Gaston, Department of Surgery, BIDMC), in the modulation of gene expr ession by nutritional ma nipulations in prostate and br east cancer (Towia Libermann, Department of Medicine, BIDMC), in the effect of plant components and synthetic analogues on prostate cancer prevention by inhibition of DNA topoisomerase (David L ee, McLean Hospital/HMS), in the effect of peptides delivered by nano-particles on prostate cancer progression (Martin Yarmush, MGH), and in the effect of ER-beta modulation by phytoestrogens on prostate cancer (Paul Mak, Urology Department, University of Massachusetts Medical School). Our long-term goal of research is to identify the effective components in nature for prevention of cancer and obesity.

Approval continuing review was obtained at BIDMC on June 13th, 2005. Women's Intervention Nutrition Study Extension - Protocol #: 2001-P-001549/7 Additional funding support was obtained from the National Cancer Institute to allow for a WINS Extension to complete the original study design follow-up duration. Notification from the IRB for approval of this extension was obtained at BIDMC on November 15th, 2005. Packages to study participants including a letter regarding current status of WINS Extension study, new consent form (2 copies, one for pt file, one for BIDMC file) and Health Status Forms were sent out in December. Follow-up will continue through 2006. Adiponectin in Relation to Breast Cancer - Protocol #: 20005p-000256 Exemption status was approved by the BIDMC Committee on Clinical Investigations on October 18 th, 2005. Plasma samples were obtained in November from existing data from the Women's Intervention Nutrition Study (WINS). Measurement of adiponectin levels began in December using RIA and data will be analyzed using univariate and multivariate analysis. This will allow us to assess whether baseline serum adiponectin levels predict risk for developing breast cancer and whether the effect of low fat di et on breast cancer is direct and/or whether it is mediated through changes in adiponectin levels. Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Di abetes) is a multi-center randomized c linical trial to examine the effects of a lifestyle intervention designed to achieve and maintain weight loss over the long term through decreased caloric intake and exercise. Look AHEAD is focusing on the disease most affected by overweight and obesity, type 2 diabetes, and on the outcome that causes the greatest morbidity and mortality, cardiovascular disease. The Look AHEAD trial has completed enrollment of 5,145 obese patients with type 2 diabetes. At study entry, participants were randomly assigned to one of two inte rventions, the Lifestyle Intervention or Diabetes Support and Education. They will be followed for a total period of up to 11.5 years. The primary aim of Look AHEAD is to study the effects of the two interventions on major cardiovascular events: heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular-related d eath. Look AHEAD also will investigate the impact of the interventions on other cardiovascular disease-related outcomes, cardiovascular risk factors, and all-cause mortality. Additional outcomes includ e: diabetes control and complications, fitness, general health, health- related quality of life and psychological outcomes. The cost and cost effectiveness of the Lifestyle Intervention relative to Diabetes Support and Education will be assessed. DSE-Control Group Two social retention events-\"Night at the Pops\" and \"Holiday Party at Longwood Grille\" were completed. Classes were organized throughout the year for nutrition, exercise and support. These classes showed improved attendance from previous years. We offered a class for Transition into Phase III- Year 5 and beyond and the first class ready to go for January 2006. We also did a seasonal Newsletter. Lifestyle Intervention Group This year we tried a new initiative, which was \"Reunion Groups\". These groups have the aim to serve as a retention event for participants to meet with the original group members from the first year. We accomplished three weight loss campai gns/refreshers-1) Mission Possible II, 2) World Series, and 3) The After Dark Campaign. We also hosted a Holiday Weight Loss Challenge. This event was new for 2005 and was not a national campaign, but was done only at the Joslin. Participants signed a contract during the holiday season to either maintain or lose weight during a matter of 8 weeks. There was an incentive provided if successful. Results from the event are below.

We are investigating the effect of the novel daidzein-rich isoflavone-aglycone extract from soy germ fermentation on the severity and frequency of hot flashes in postmenopausal women. We are responsible for analyses of biomarkers in the blood and urine samples. The laboratory is equipped with two state-of-art HPLC systems to determine soy isoflavones and catecholamines for the proposed clinical study. The pilot and feasibility study as been accepted for publication and the recr uitment for the fu ll trial has been completed; we are analyzing the data an d preparing manuscripts with the results. Calcium Supplementation for Healthy Weight (CaSHew) The CSNM has been given the opportunity to collaborate with one of our Boston Obesity Nutrition Research groups at the Massachusetts General Hospital to investigate Calcium Supplementation for Healthy Weight (CaSHew). The hypothesis is adding calcium and vitamin D supplementation, via orange juice, to caloric restriction enhances weight loss and decreases visceral fa t in adults with BMI in the range of 25 to 35 kg/m 2. The primary objective of this proposal is to evaluate the effect of cal cium and vitamin D supplementation (in form of calcium and vitamin D fortified orange juice beverage) in combination with caloric deficit diet on weight loss in overweight and obese adults. Visceral fat loss will be examined as a secondary outcome. New Staff We have two new investigators Grazyna Galicka-Piskorska, MD, Ph.D. an instructor in Medicine with the division of Nephrology; she will be looking at the effect of surgical weight reduction and associated medical interventions on microalbuminuria and hypertension in patien ts with morbid obesity. The other investigator Daniel S. Rooks, Ph.D. from the division of Rheumatology, Assistant Professor in Medicine will be investigating the role of preoperative exercise for weight loss surgery. New Awards and Clinical Trials Dr. Zhou will be co-investigator on a new grant, \"New strategies for interpreting in vivo prostate MRI/MRS choline spectra: manipulating gene expression to enha nce cancer specificity\". The award is from the Department of Defense and is a Hypothesis Development Award. Dr. Blackburn was awarded two new grants, \"Regular OJ-- Effect of calcium/vitamin D on weight loss\" and \"Light OJ-- Effect of calcium/vitamin D on weight loss\".

Callery, MD, FACS Pancreatic cancer is an extraordinarily lethal disease. It is profoundly resistant to any therapy currently ava ilable. Our research focuses on the identification of the molecular mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon. We have undertaken three different approaches to reveal these mechanisms. Investigate the role of Bcl-X L in the chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer . We have examined the expression and potency of three major death receptors TNF-R, TRAIL-R and Fas in mediating cytotoxicity in pancreatic cancer cell lines. We have analyzed the expression of major anti-apoptotic factors, cell cycle re gulators, and death receptor decoys (DcRs) in comparison with normal pa ncreas tissues and five other human malignant tumor cell lines. By using RNA interference (RNAi) we demonstrate that predominant Bcl-X L overexpression plays a critical role in pancreatic cancer chemoresistance. We have utilized RNA interference (RNAi) to deplete Bcl-X L expression and further investigated its effect s on chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer by using in vitro assay and in vivo mouse tumor xenograft models. Investigate the role of HDAC-1 in tumorigenesis of pancreatic cancer . Histone by alteri ng the acetylation status of histones and some transcription factors on target gene promoters. We have found that pancreatic cancer cell lines overexpress HDAC-1 co mpared to control tissues. Trichostatin A (TSA) treatment of pancreatic cancer cell lines identified TSA-resistant and sensitive phenotypes. To reveal the role that HDAC-1 may play in tumorigenesis of pancreatic cancer, we have constructed HDAC-1 knockdown cells and control counterparts by using RNAi. The effects of HDAC-1 knockdown on cancer cell proliferation and the growth of tumor xenograft in vivo are assessed. Development of optimal combinatorial chemotherapy . Pancreatic cancer cells overexpress multiple anti-apoptotic factors and death receptor decoys, and are strongly resistant to radiation, and to 5-fluorourical (5-FU)- or gemcitabine (Gem)-based chemotherapy regimens. Most panc reatic (Dox) when administered individually. We hypothesized that an optimal combination of anti-tumor drugs would maximize killing of pancreatic cancer cells of diverse sources at low drug doses. In order to achieve this goal, we have investigated the cytotoxic effects of PS-341, GA, TSA and Dox in eight invasive pancreatic cancer cell lines in the absence of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as death receptor ligands. In particular, we have compared the efficaci es of cytotoxicity of di fferent combinatorial regimens among these drugs in pancreatic cancer cell lines. Through these analyses, we have identified an optimal drug combination that effective kill most pancreatic cancer cell lines in vitro .

We have demonstrated that different pancreatic cancer cell lines coexpress high-level TRAI L-R, Fas, and TNF-R1, but are strongly resistant to apoptosis triggered by the death receptors. Death recept or decoys DcR2 and DcR3 overexpression may partly contribute to the resistance of pancreatic cancer cells to TRAIL-R and Fas-mediated cytotoxicity. However, predominant Bcl-XL overexpression plays a vital role in the chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer. We have developed Bcl-XL RNAi knockdown overexpression in The knockdown predominant Bcl-XL overexpression significantly reduces the viability of pancreatic cancer cells to TNF- and TRAIL mediated apoptosis by sublethal-dose PS-341 and GA or combined antitumor drugs including PS-341/Ga and PS-341/TSA regimens. To investigate further the effects of Bcl-XL depletion on tumor growth, we subcutaneously injected Bcl-XL knockdown pancreatic cancer cells and control counterparts into athymic mice at rear flanks. The animals were maintained for 2 months to allow tumor engraftment. At the end of the experiment, tumor volumes and weight were measured for statistic comparison between Bcl-XL knockdown and control groups. We found that the knockdown of Bcl-XL significantly increased apoptosis, reduced angiogenesis and suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Pancreatic cancer cell lines overexpr ess HDAC-1 compared to control tissu es. Trichostatin A (TSA) treatment of pancreatic cancer cell lines identif ied TSA-resistant and sensitive phenotyp es. To reveal the role that HDAC- 1 may play in tumorigenesis of pancreatic cancer, we have constructed HDAC-1 knockdown cells and control counterparts by retroviral vector harboring RNAi constructs . By using in vitro proliferation assay, we found that HDAC-1 depletion in TSA-sensitive cells had no effect s on proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells in the presence or absence of antitumor durgs under hypoxic or monoxic conditions. However, TNF - triggered proliferation of TSA-resistant pancreatic cancer cells in the presence of PS-341 and TSA/PS-341 under hypoxic conditions. In a preliminary study, we found that HDAC-1 knockdown increased the growth of xenografts derived from TSA- resistant cells in athymic mouse models. We have further purified cellular RNA from HDAC-1 knockdown and control cells for gene profiling assays in order to identify HDAC-1 regulated target genes in the future. We have found low-dose proteasome Jirong Bai, and Aram Demirjian Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2005 Division of General Surgery Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 49 induces cytotoxicity in a panel of eight diverse pa ncreatic cancer cell lines. Combining TSA with PS-341 caused RelA depletion, effectively disrupted NF B signaling, suppressed the predominant endogenous anti- apoptotic factor Bcl-XL overexpression, and caused an average of 76% apoptotic cell death in six of eight pancreatic cell lines by triggering the intrinsic apopto sis pathway. TSA and PS-341 combinatorial therapy also caused the depletion of K-Ras, pancreatic cancer inactivating NF B signaling and MAP kinase pathways and may represent a novel antitumor chemotherapy.

Hagen, PhD Our current NIH sponsored research is concerned with the regulation of gastric barrier function during health and disease, and our projects include mechanisms that regulate tight junction organization and permeability in the stomach, gastric mucosal restitution after injury, and cell death and survival of gastric epithelial cells. Although we are particularly interested in the regulation of barrier function during Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection and how defects in the gastric mucosal barrier result in mucosal damage and gastric atrophy during infection, such studies are also pertinent to understanding gastric ulceration and stress-induced mucosal damage under surg ical conditions and other critical illnesses including trauma and sepsis, where inflammation and hypoxia impact mucosal permeability, restitution, and epithelial cell death. Tight junction Permeability Although the structure of tight junctions is well defined (inset), whether this generic organization is the same and how it relates to barrier properties of the gastric mucosa is unknown. In recent studies, it was shown that when o ccludin, one of two proteins that seal the paracellular space (inset), is knocked-out, mucosal damage occurs in the stomach and the stomach histology is id entical to that seen during infection with HP. Lack of occludin affected only 2 tissues, the stomach and testis, suggesting that occludin regulates, in a unique way, the maintenance and/or development of tight junctions in thes e tissues. Because little is known about how occludin regulates development and/or maintenance of tight junctions at the surface of the gastric mucosa or in gastric glands, new culture models were recently developed by us to study the cell and molecular regulation of occludin in gastric surface and chief ce lls. How infection with HP alters occludin localization and mucosal permeability are studies currently underway in the laboratory. Gastric Mucosal Restitution after Injury This laboratory is most known for studies concerning mechanisms that regulate restitution, which is rapid epithelial repair after injury, in the stomach. Our current focus co ncerns mechanisms by which intracellular pH is regulated and how this regulation affects restitution and subsequent repair of barrier function after injury. We recently proposed a novel idea that H+/lactate export, via the monocarboxylate transporter, may be essential for pH regulation during restitution by exporting lactate that is gene rated by glycolysis, a process we recently showed to be the main energy source for restitution after injury in the st omach. Current studies are concerned with understanding the role of monocarboxylate transport in restitution. Cell Death A new area of investigation in the laboratory is concerne d with understanding pathways that regulate cell death and survival of gastric epithelial cells. These new studies were initiated because Th1 cytokines, liberated during HP infection, kill gastric epithelial cells rather than affecting ti ght junction integrity as occurs in other GI cells. In all inflammatory diseases of the stomach, including infection with HP, death of gastric chief and parietal cells within the gastric gland results in atrophy, which is the major initiating factor in the progression to gastric cancer. In work we submitted for publication in the past year, a novel idea was proposed that gastric chief and parietal cells have single, non-overlapping, cell death path ways that are regulated by unique factors and physiology. Chief cells express BCL-X, which is regulated by transcriptional mech anisms, whereas parietal cells express BAD, which is regulated by intracellular signaling pathways that result in serine phosphorylation. The lab is currently working to understand the regulation of these pathways using isolated cell models. from Mitic, et al, Am J Physiol 279: G250, 2002 Dr. Susan Ha genDepartment of Surgery Annual Research Report 2005 Division of General Surgery 52 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Current Employees Research Laboratory Songhua Zhang, MD, PhD Research Fellow Regina Ragasa, BS Research Assistant Andrew French, BA Administrative Coordinator Saeko Yanaka Student, Tokyo University Jacob Sanders Student, Harvard University Core Facilities Dan Brown, MS Sr. Research Associate, Microscopy Core Justine Curley, MS Research Assistant, Microscopy Core Suzanne White, BS Histotechnologist Supervisor, Histology Core Wendy Litzkow, BS Histotechnologist, Histology Core Core Facility Staff: Dan Brown, Justine Curley, Suzanne White, (Left) and Wendy Litzkow (Right) LIST OF CURRENT FUNDING \"GI Mucosal Barrier in Health and Surgical Disease\" National Institutes of Health, NIDDK - DK15681-33 Principal Investigator: Susan J.

Dr. Kimihito Tashima finished a paper where he outlined the procedure for prepar ing isolated cultures of gastric chief cells that grow into a confluent monolayer within 3 days. We pursued this line of investigation because no immortalized cell lines exist for gastric parietal or chie f cells and, to date, it has not been possible to grow isolated chief cells in culture from rodent species. To accomp lish the production of chief cell cultu res, we determined that HGF is required. Although the physiological significance of th is finding is not presently known, HGF facilitates better cell attachment after isolation and increases protein synthesis resulting in faster confluency and greater pepsinogen protein available for secretion. Confluent monolayers of chief cells also have a very high transepithelial resistance and low permeability making them suitable for further studies of barrier properties and regulation of tight junction structure. We then used the chief cell cultures to show how pro-inflammatory cytokines affect cell viability via the cell survival/death pathway regulated by BCL-X. In April of 2005, Dr. Tashima returned to Japan to take a position as an Associate Professor of Pharmacology. In collaboration with Dr. Ursula Seidler, Professor of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at Hannover Medical School in Germany, we finished a paper to show the significance of Kir4.1 channels in membrane trafficking and acid secretion in gastric parietal cells. In brief, Ki r4.1 channels are apical membrane channels in parietal cells that we propose function, in concert with KCNQ1 channels, to regulate K+-efflux and acid secretion after stimulation. We believe that the ion conductance channels contain heteromeric Kir proteins and that KCNQ1 functions in membrane depolarization after stimulation.

Accomplishments this year were successful completion, in collaboration with Dr. Per-Olof Hasselgren, of the \"Annual Research Report\" and \"Funding Sources for Residents\". I was al so able to fill the vacant Administrative Coordinator position in the Office for Surgical Research with a very capable and experienced administrator, Andrew French, who was past Office Manager for the Shad Fitness Center at the Harvard Business School. I continued to direct the Morphology, Histology, and Confocal Microscopy Core Facilities and to provide oversight and consultation for imaging experiments in the hospital and for members of the Harvard Digestive Diseases Center. Accomplishments this year were that I applied for and was awarded, by the BIDMC, funds to purchase a new confocal microscope, a Zeiss LSM510 META, for the Morphology Core Facility. This instrument will replace our outdated Bi o-Rad MRC1024 laser confocal system. I submitted a shared instrument grant application to the NIH in collaboration with 6 other PI's at the BIDMC to request funds for a live-cell confocal microscope. This instrument will be used for measuring intracellu lar pH and for doing FRET analysis in living cells. We obtained a good priority score and the application is pending a funding decision. I was also provided funds by Research and Academic Affairs to hire a new histotechnologist, Wendy Litzkow, to help with the ever increasing demand for se rvice in the Histology Core Facility. Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2005 Division of General Surgery 54 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Individual Accomplishments I was asked to sit on 2 NIH study sections in 2005. The first invitation was to review applications for an ad hoc section set-up to review a program pr oject grant application from the University of Illinois at Chicago. The second invitation was to review applications for the newly established Gastrointestinal Mucosal Pathobiology (GMPB) study section. Subsequently, I became a charter member of the GMPB study section for a 3 year term starting in October of 2005. I was invited to serve as an abstract reviewer in the Es ophageal, Gastric, and Duodenal Disorders section of the American Gastroenterologi cal Association (AGA). I was asked to be session chair: \"H. pylori Biology and Gastric Immunology\" at the 10th International Proton Transport Conference in Sa n Diego CA. March, 2005. Invited Presentations (Local, National, and International) Invited Speaker: \"Revisiting the Harvard Connection: Acid -base Balance and Bile Salts on Physiology of the Frog Gastric Mucosa\".

Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2005 Division of General Surgery 56 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2005 Division of General Surgery Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 57 Per-Olof Hasselgren, MD, PhD The research efforts in our group are focused on the metabolic and inflammatory responses to injury and sepsis in skeletal musc le and intestinal mucosa. Sepsis and severe injury are associated with muscle wasting (Figure 1), mainly reflecting ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation of the myofibrillar proteins actin and myosin. Our research supports a model in which myofilaments are released from the sarcomere thorugh a calcium/calpain-dependent mechanism followed by ubiquitination and degradation of actin and myosin by the 26S proteasome. The gene expression of calpains and several components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, in particular the ubiquitin ligases atrogin-1 and MuRF1, is upregulated in atrophying muscle, supporting the concept that increased gene transcription is an integral part of muscle wasting mechanisms. Currently, the transcriptional regulation of genes in the ubiquitin-proteas ome pathway is examined. In particular, the roles of the transcription factors C/EBP and and NF-kB as well as the nucl ear co-factors p 300 and PGC-1 and in the regulation of atrogin-1 and MuRF1 expression are examined. In addition, the role of calcium in sepsis-induced and glucocorticoid-regulated muscle proteolysis is examined, in particular with regards to the activation of calcium- calmodulin protein kinase II and the PI3K/Akt/GSK3 signaling pathway. The long-term goal of the studies is to define molecular mechanisms responsible for sepsis-induced muscle proteolysis and to de fine molecule(s) that can be targeted to prevent or treat muscle wasting in sepsis and other catabolic conditions. In other studies, the regulation of IL-6 production in gut mucosa and enterocytes is examined. IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine that can have both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties. In previous studies, we found evidence that mucosal IL-6 production is increased during sepsis and endotoxemia and in human enterocytes stimulated with IL- 1 (Figure 2). In other experiments, we defined transcription factors (NF-kB, AP-1, CREB, and C/EBP) that are involved in the activation of the IL-6 gene in stimulated enterocytes. We have recently made the interesting observation that the heat shock response upregulates the expression of IL-6 in stimulated enterocytes and in intestinal mucosa. In current experiments, we are defining signaling pathways that are involved in heat shock-induced potentiation of IL-6 production and have found evidence that the PI3K/Akt pathway may be important for this response. In more recent experiments, we have found evidence that probiotic bacteria may also potentiate IL-6 production in enterocytes and that this effect of probiotics is secondary to induction of the heat shock response. Because IL-6 may exert protective effects in enterocytes/gut mucosa, treatments that augment IL-6 production and understanding the mechanisms of stimulated IL-6 production may have important clinical implications.

Jones, MD, FACS Section for Minimally Invasive Surgery, Center for Minimally Invasive Surgery (CMIS) Simulation and Skills Center, Bariatric Program Our group integrates clinical activity and teaching into innovation and education research. We have focused on minimally invasive surgery, bariatric surgery, and technical skill acquisition. Bench-top work last year has led to technical innovations in instrumentation for laparoscopic adjustable banding, robotic colonoscopy, and fibrin glue repair of inguinal hernia repair and current investigation is leading to a better understanding of hormonal regulation of obesity. CMIS has trained medical students, residents, research fellows, clinical fellows, and surgeons worldwide in advanced laparoscopic techniques. Education research is fo cused on establishing a technical skills laboratory validating new teaching tools and instituting curriculums for medical students and residents. At Harvard Medical School we have established educational programs as part of the Tele-conferencing, Simulation and Technical Skills Lab. First year students observe live surgery telebroadcasts that are available to student groups learning anatomy. During clerkships, students also interact with surgeons from the telec onference center in small gr oups. These unique learning approaches have challenged traditional pathways. The skills lab has recen tly been expanded with the addition of a mock operating theatre and mock ICU, and $2.75 million in philanthropic gifts to create the Simulation and Skills Lab. Further information about the CMIS lab can be obtained at http://www.bidmc.harvard.edu/mis . In collaboration, with the Department of Chemical Engineering at MIT, we have investigated the use of alginate and collagen as materials, which can be modified to synthesize an injectable mesh. The goal is to develop a biodegradable liquid that will solidify upon injection into the hernia defect. Availability of an injectable liquid mesh cannot only make the hernia operation less invasive but also potentially eliminate the need fo r incisions. The project is currently funded through the Center for the Integration of Medicine and Innovative Technology (CIMIT), a research consortium of Harvard hospitals and MIT. In collaboration with the Weight Loss Program at MGH, we have developed a rodent model to study the laparoscopic adjustable band technique compared to the gastric bypass surgery. Studies evaluate central gut neuroendocrine changes after surgery, specifically ghrelin , the POMC pathway, and PYY 3-3. Bariatric efforts have also resulted in publication of evidence-based best practices in Massachusetts, hospital clinical care pathways, SAGES national consensus statement on the surgical tr eatment of morbid obesity, and led the American Colle ge of Surgeons Bariatric Network.

Tawa, Jr., MD, PhD Basic Research Our work focuses on the mechanisms by which dietary protein or amino acid defi ciency reduces muscle proteolysis. In the past year, we have performed experiments demonstrating that pre-conditioning with a low protein diet prevents the rise in protein breakdown and loss of muscle size induced by catabolic stimuli, including denervation, fasting, or free radical exposure. Under these circumstan ces, low protein diets appear to block the activation of the muscle-specific ubiquitin-protein ligase atrogin, which normally is induced under catabolic conditions.

Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2005 Division of General Surgery 76 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Plans for the Coming Year Basic Research Determining the basis for the suppression of muscle proteolysis which occurs in conditions of dietary protein deficiency and prolonged fasting is our main goal. We have now shown that protein deficiency represents a low insulin state, with an accompanying, predictable inhibition of Akt/mTOR kinase signaling in muscle. A suppression of Akt signaling would normally result in activation of the transcri ption factor FOXO, with subsequent induction of atrogin and a rise in ubiquitin-p roteasome mediated proteolysis. However, in protein deficient animals, FOXO's ability to induce a rise in atrogin in muscle is profoundly suppressed. We will further explore the intracellular mechanisms for this adaptation, including the role.of endocrine signals, specifically the interaction between insulin signaling and thyroid and adrenal status in protein deficient animals. The role of specific intracellular si gnaling mechanisms involving Sirt-1 and HIF, which may modify FOXO action and which have relevance to other physiological states such as caloric restriction and aging, will also be assessed.

In collaboration with Dr. John Frangioni at the BIDMC, NIR techniques are being investigated in the laboratory to transcutaneously visualize the location of major arterial and venous perforating vessels to aid in flap design (see Figure 1). Already, data gathered in a pig model shows promise for future work. Clinical Research Lymphedema . The Lymphedema Treatment Center continues to develop under the direction of Drs. Slavin and Borud. Now open two afternoons a month, the Clinic treated 183 patients in the last 2.5 years and also serves as a focal point for much needed residency education in the area of the diagnosis and treatment of lymphedema. No other medical institution in Boston (and few in the U. S.) provides residency education in this area of patient care. Clinical data on lymphedema is leading to research projects and papers by attending physicians and residents. Drs. Slavin and Borud are currently managing the preparation of manuscripts involving the treatment of both lymphedema and lipedema. Several manuscripts are in press; others have been submitted for publication. Abstracts by both attending physicians and faculty have also been presented at regional, national, and international meetings. Research involving the use of bioimped ance analysis to document lymphedema is being conducted in collaboration with Anne Warren, a clinical research fellow from HMS. Pilot studies performed using the bioimpedance device has shown it to be a sensitive, reliable tool for evaluating and measuring lymphedema non-invasively. Planned future studies include using the technology to document clinical response to the surgical treatment of lymphedema. Massive Weight Loss / Body Contouring . Dr. Borud has established a database of patients undergoing body contouring following massive weight loss. To date, over 150 patients have been treated with major body contouring procedures, including panniculectomy, brachioplasty, mastopexy, neck lift, lower body lift, and thigh lift. Already, analysis of this experience has resulted in numerous local, regional, and national presentations. Peter Jay Sharp Foundation Program for Reconstructive and Aesthetic Breast Surgery . Through the efforts of Drs. Slavin, Tobias, Lee, Borud, and staff, development continues on the Peter Jay Sharp Foundation Program for Aesthetic and Reconstructive Breast Surgery. In the past two years, 120 perforator and S-GAP flaps have been performed for breast reconstruction. Clinical data from these cases is now being compiled and analyzed for future perforator flap studies, including some in the following areas: BRCA and bilateral mastectomy with DIEP Flap reconstruction; Fluorescein for evaluation of skin sparing mastectomy flaps; Vitamin E coagulophathy: a case report and literature review; Pedicled perforator flaps in massive weight deep infe rior epigastric perforator anatomy: animal study in pigs.

In the past two years, 120 perforator and S-GAP flaps have been performed by Drs. Lee and Tobias for breast reconstruction. The program has also been active in resident education. A nurse manager, Linda Dicenzo, RN, was hired to work with patients and to develop the infrastructure of the program, including the ordering of clinical equipment. In the year, the Division practice moved into a new space, and developed key networks and working relationships with the BIDMC breast center, bariatric surgeons, and local area VNA's. Throughout the year, both public relations and educational materials for patients were developed including a website (www.bostondiep.com), Sharp Foundation brochures, and an educational CD-ROM for patients. At the end of the year, a Harvard- wide fellowship was submitted to the GME to establish an unaccredited Reconstructive and Aesthetic Breast Fellowship at the BI DMC. Dr. Sheila Barnett, Director of Graduate Medical Education, BIDMC, has said that the fello wship submission is a \"mode l proposal\" for unaccredited fellowships in the medical center. The start of the breast fellowship is planned for July 1, 2006. Recruitment has begun. Robert M. Goldwyn, M.D., Di stinguished Visiting Lectureshi p with Harvard Medical School . Dr. Slavin, with help from Geoffrey Brahmer, continued to raise funds for the lectureship. To date, the fund has accrued $96,000 in donations. It is the goal of this project to establish a yearly visiting professor lectureship in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at the BIDMC. A second solicitation is planned for 2006. Lymphedema . Drs. Slavin and Borud continue to expand their efforts in the lymphedema clinic, involving more residents in clinical research, speci al projects, and presentations each year. Our scientific collaboration continues with Dr. H\u00e5kan Brorson, M.D., a surgical investigator in Malmo, Sweden. In 2005, Dr. Brorson, a world expert in the surgical treatment of lymphedema, came to the BIDMC to oper ate with Dr. Slavin on a patient from Israel with extreme lipedema. Another c linical collaboration for lymphedema was developed with is with Laura Jacobs, M.D., Ph.D., a physical medicine an d rehabilitation expert. Dr. Jacobs is the inventor of Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2005 Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 81 the Normatec, an external pneumatic compression device which has been effective with lymphedema, lipedema, chronic vascular disease, and open wounds. In January, 2005, Dr. Slavin and Dr. Borud spok e to the Massachusetts HMO Medical Directors on lymphedema, patient care needs, and the difficulties of obtaining payment from insurance companies. This presentation was a result of advocacy on behalf of patients in the General Court of Massachusetts for Senate Bill 848, which passed the Massachusetts State Senate. Mary Beth Heffernan, Gove rnmental Director, BIDMC, and Geoffrey Brahmer were actively involved in organizing and planning the meeting. The entire Division, including residents and medical students, was active on behalf of patients with lymphedema, both Jennifer Forgione and Linda Dicenzo, RN, worked closely with patients for information and referral, appointment scheduling, patient education, and follow-up. Hand Surgery . Dr. Upton led a hand dissection workshop at HMS on February 17, 2005. The workshop was organized by the BIDMC Division of Plastic Surgery and the Department of Orthopaedics. In addition to Drs. Borud, Day, and Upton from the BIDMC, Harvard faculty members from the MGH and Children's Hospital also led specific components of the se ssion, teaching about 30 residents and in terns in a total dissection of the upper limb: plexus nerve, flexor mechanisms, extensor mechanisms, wrist and interphalangal joints, arterial anatomy and intrinsic muscles. The Division also clos ely collaborated with the De partment of Orthopaedic Surgery to develop a proposal for a second ACGME hand fellow at the BIDMC.

During the last few years, I developed the Microcirculation Lab, whic h tests the microvasculature in a non-invasive way. The Microcirculation Lab is also equipped w ith an ultrasound apparatus that enables evaluation of endothelial function in the brachial artery. Our research is mainly funded by gran ts from the NIH, American Di abetes Association, and by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. In addition, we conduct investigator-initiated studies that are funded by the pharmaceutical industry. I am interested in the relationship between functional change s in the vascular reactivity a nd structural changes of the skin. Other interests include the effect of c-nociceptive fiber dysfunction of wound healing and the diabetes-related impairment of angiogenesis. My laboratory is also collaborating with small biotech comp anies. This collaboration has resulted in funding from the NIH, either in the form of SBIR or SBTT grants. The main aim of these collaborations is to develop new techniques that can improve our diag nostic abilities or develop new therapeu tic interventions that will treat long- term diabetic complications. My group is also interested in the etiology of diabetic foot problems and the pathophysiology of foot ulcer healing in diabetes. We are curren tly conducting a larger prospective study that will evaluate the role of microvascular dysfunction in foot ulceration and wound healing failure. We also plan to evaluate the degree of oxygenation in the ulcer bed by using hyperspectral imaging to quantify the amount of oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin in the ulcer distribution (Figure 1). In collaboration with the department of Radiology, we also employ a 3 Tesla (3T) magnetic resonance scanner that can access metabolic ac tivity through measurements of the concentrations and reaction rates of the high-energy phosphorus cellular compounds in humans by employing magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy methods. The main advantage of this technique is that it can give a direct non-invasive assessment of muscle metabolism. As a first step, we evaluate the effect of diabetes and its complications on the leg blood flow and metabolic function. Finally, research in my Lab, in collaboration with Roy Freeman, MD, examines the natural history of the progression of peripheral neuropathy in diabetic patients.

Bach, MD My group focuses on the effects of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and two of the products of HO-1 degradation of heme in models of shock, transplantation and vascular injury. We are particularly interested in cell signal transduction and have focused on the mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) and other signaling molecules in particular this year. We studied the effects of biliverdin/bilirubin in ischemia-rep erfusion injury (IRI) in models of the small intestinal and liver transplantation as well as in intimal hyperplasia following balloon injury. Most have begun a study of the signaling events consequent to biliverdin administration in LPS stimulated macrophages. Biliverdin acted to ameliorate the undesirable consequences of decreased function and tissue injury in IRI likely based on its potent anti-inflammatory properties. Interestingly, biliverdin di d not achieve these results in the same manner as carbon monoxide (CO), another agent we tested in the small bowel transplantation mode l even though both agents prevented bowel dysfunction and cell damage. Biliverdin su ppressed the expression of the adhesion molecules and markedly reduced the infiltration of host leukocytes into th e bowel, something that CO did not do. This is in concert with our findings that bilirubin suppressed adhesion mole cules on cultured endothelial cells stimulated with TNF while CO did not. The studies on the suppression of smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation following balloon injury provided further evidence that the beneficial effects of biliverdin/bilirubin are mediated by pathways different from the effects of CO. Both biliverdin/bilirubin and CO suppressed SMC proliferation in vitro and intimal hyperplasia in vivo, however, the signaling molecules that effected these changes were diff erent for CO and biliverdin. Even though both molecules involved modulation of p38 MAPK, biliverdin suppressed p38 while CO stimulated p38. We hypothesize that this is due to the differential modulation of p38 and p38 by CO and biliverdin. As a part of the study with biliverdin and intimal hyperplasia, we studied the downstream signaling molecules involved in those effects. Interestingly, biliverdin modulated the phosphorylation of Rb leading to hyperphosphorylation of that molecule and consequent suppression of action of transcription factors such as YY1 that are needed for SMC pr oliferation. This again was different from the effects of CO. We extensively studied the effects of expressing HO-1 in a model of tolerance induced by DST. The conclusions from that study showed that not only did induction of HO-1 increase the e fficacy of DST stimulated tolerance, but blocking of HO-1 eliminated the tolerance-inducing effect s of DST. This finding suggests that HO-1 may be a critical molecule that is need ed for T regulatory mediated tolerance, something we are testing further. Also in that study, we confirmed the earlier findings of the previous years that HO-1 expression le ads to antigen induced cell death (AICD). However, in this case we showed additionally that HO-1 expression did not lead to the death of T regulatory cells, although exact quantification of those effects must still be accomplished.

Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2005 Division of Transplant Surgery Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 99 Douglas W. Hanto, MD, PhD Basic Research My current laboratory research is focused on understandi ng the mechanisms of antibod y-mediated rejection in ABO incompatible allografts and the development of accommoda tion post-transplant. We are examining the ability of endothelial cells, the target of antibody-mediated rejectio n, to upregulate protective genes (genes that are anti- inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and anti-proliferative in so me cases), encoding heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), A20, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL. Expression of protective genes in the endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells protects these cells from undergoing activa tion that leads to inflammation and graft rejection. We hypothesize that treatment of the donor and recipient by inducing HO-1 or administering a product such as CO or biliverdin will protect the endothelial cells from antibodies and complement. We are testing our approach in a rodent model and will follow this with large an imal models (pig and cynomolgus monkeys ) in which ABO incompatible animals are tested. This work is being done in collaboration with Fr itz Bach, M.D., and Leo Otterbein, Ph.D. in our division. A second area of focus is the development of a non-human primate model of liver transplantation and the testing of novel tolerogenic immunosuppressive regimens. We are de veloping method for the successf ul transplantation of the liver in cynomolgus monkeys. We are planning to examine the ability of interleukin-2 an d interleukin-15 fusion proteins and rapamycin (with or without donor specific transfusions) to induce a permanent state of tolerance as has been shown in a monkey islet cell transplant model. The mechanism is limitation of the early expansion of activated T cells, accentuation of their subseque nt apoptotic clearance, amplifying their depleti on by antibody dependent mechanisms, while preserving CD4+CD25+ T cell dependent immunoregulatory networks. The balance between cytopathic and regulatory T cells is thereby tipped toward regulatory cells. We believe this may be a potent and effective means of inducing tolerance in the non-human prim ate model of liver transplantation and will have clinical applicability. This work is being done in collaboration w ith Terry Strom, M.D., Maria Koulmanda, Ph.D., and Scott Johnson, M.D. Clinical Research We are engaged in a number of prospective and retrospective clinical studies involving transplantation (kidney, liver, pancreas, and islet), dialysis acce ss, and nontransplant hepa tobiliary surgery. We have had a longstanding interest in the development of malignancies after transpla ntation, particularly post-t ransplant lymphoproliferative diseases (PTLD), and also in the risk of transmission of malignancy to recipients from donors with cancer. We have also been interested in antibody mediated rejection in ki dney and liver allograft recipients and the development of therapeutic strategies to permit ABO incompatible transplant s and transplants in highly sensitized patients. With the introduction of several new immunosuppressive drugs over the past several years, we are examining changes in immunosuppressive protocols to minimize the side-effects of chronic corticosteroid and calcineurin inhibitor toxicity. The ability to safely transplant HIV+ patients is another significant focus of our clinical research activities as part of a multi-center NIH sponsored trial. We are co -investigators in an NIH/NIAID Clinical Trials in Organ Transplantation study of novel immunosuppr essive protocols. We are beginning a clinical study in liver transplant recipients using transcriptional profiling to analyze the allograft response in patients that are likely to have predictive value for post-transplant liver function and risk of rejection, with the ultimate goal of being able to individualize the degree of immunosuppression. There are many other ongoing clinical studies examining several issues, including: risk of infectious complications with thymoglobulin induction in kidney transplant recipients; use of donors after cardiac death for kidney, liver, and pancreas transplantation; sa fety and efficacy of older live kidney donors; role of surgical procedures for bleeding varices in the transplant era; results of total hepatectomy and backtable resection for hepatic malignancies; incidence and outcome of colon cancer after kidney and liver transplantation; antiviral prophylaxis in kidney transpla ntation; of FTY720, a novel new immunosuppressive drug, in kidney transplantation.

Karp, MD Basic Research Basic research in the Karp laboratory is concerned with the molecular basis for liver development and regeneration. Ultimately we would like to apply this knowledge to produce liver tissue substitutes, enhance liver regeneration, and understand liver cancer. Multiple projects are ongoing in the labora tory. The first involves a screen for genes that are important for liver development and regeneration. We identified a number of transcription factors and members of important signaling pathways that are differentially regulated during liver development and regeneration. These are currently being analyzed using real time PCR, in situ hybridization, gene-trap knockouts, RNA inhibition, and transgenic overexpression. The second project seeks to determine lin eage commitments in the developing and regenerating liver. We believe understand ing which cells give rise to which cells in vivo will suggest a strategy for recapitulating liver organoge nesis in vitro. Using transgenic mice that express an inducible recombinase in the liver and a target construct th at fluoresces when the recombinase is activated, we are able to heritably mark liver cells in a temporally-restricted manner. Following the cells and their progeny is then possible. Combining this approach with 2/3 hepatectomy and other models of liver damage we can determine how the liver is repopulated. Other research involves the role of BMP signaling in liver regeneration using inducible gene targeting of specific members of the BMP family after 2/3 hepatectomy. Clinical Research Clinical research is concerned with predictors of graft survival from donation after cardiac death organs (DCD). We are reviewing the database of the New England Organ Bank to determine whether we can predict whether which factors make an organ unsuitable for transplantation.

Otterbein, PhD My work focuses on the potent therapeutic benefit of low concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) in models of shock, transplantation, and vascular injury. This work stems from the study of heme oxygenase-1, which is also a focus of the laboratory, as an induci ble enzyme that generates CO during the catalysis of heme. My research support is to study mechanisms by which CO is protective, which includes identifying novel targets of its action. We are particularly interested in cell signal transduction, an d this year we focused on the mitogen activated protein kinases as well as the role of RhoA and eNOS and the generation of nitric oxide (NO) in endothelial cells. The genes which encode signaling pathways, with the exception of eNOS, while not containing heme moietie s, the otherwise presumed cellular target of CO, are critically involved in allowing CO to exert protective effects. Macrophages Results from a comprehensive gene microarray in CO- exposed macrophages revealed the candidate target gene Egr-1. Egr-1 is a master switch in inflammatory gene regulation. CO abrogated its induction by endotoxin. We confirmed that the ability of CO to block Egr-1 required the upregulation of PPAR using siRNA and cre-lox technology. In an effort to determine the mechanism by which CO induces PPAR , we examined the role of mitochondria as being a source of a large pool of heme- containing moieties in the cell. Using confocal microscopy and dyes, we dete rmined that CO increases an oxidative burst in the cell within 15 seconds of exposure. Figure 1 is FACs data showing the increase in fluorescence DCF dye which reacts with oxy gen radicals. This mild ROS burst leads to rapid stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor1- (HIF1-) that significantly pr ecedes expression of PPAR . The working hypothesis is that CO leads to a mild and transient generation of reactiv e oxygen species (ROS) that alters th e cellular phenotype towards one geared toward cytoprotection involving these two gene products. Our focus this upcoming year will be to confirm these observations and investigate further the mechanisms by which CO and ROS regulate cell signaling. We are currently investigating these events and gene expression patterns and applying them to other systems, such as the endothelial cell, vascular injury and organ rejection following transplantation, where CO exerts salutary effects. Endothelial Cells We are also very interested in the endothelial cell as the principal barrier cell between the vascular lumen and underlying tissue parenchyma. Moreover, the EC is the first target cell (other then the circulating leukocytes) that CO would target. Unlike smooth muscle cel ls where CO is anti-proliferative, CO augments cellular growth of EC to increase repair of the vessel. Figure 2 depicts CD31 & ICAM staining of rat carotid arteries 5 days post angioplasty. Exposure to CO (250 ppm) for 1 hr leads to more rapid re-endothelialization vs air-treated (arrows depict positively-stained cells) 5 days later. We believe this to be important in limiting intimal hyperplasia and lesion development. The focus of this project is to delineate the mechanism(s) by which this occurs which seems to involve the expression and activation of RhoA and eNOS and NO generation.

Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2005 Division of Urology Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 117 William C. DeWolf, MD Basic Research The basic component of my own research deals with biochemical characterization of a stem cell antigen called Gp200 that we originally described in 1992. We were the first to sequence the molecule and it was been found to be identical to a protein called podocalyxin (also TRA 1-60, TRA 1-81 and GCTM-2). This molecule is a 528 amino acid membrane protein that is heavily glycosylated an d contains a single putative transmembrane protein. Podocalyxin has a large extracellular region containing a mucin and globular domain and a small cytoplasmic domain with a PDZ-binding motif. Podocalyxin was originally identified and cloned from podocytes, the blood- filtering cells of the kidney, where it has been shown to have putative function as a protein anchoring membrane protein that forms complexes with other proteins through its cytoplasmic PDZ-binding motif. This podocalyxin complex is critical for proper podocyte function. We ar e studying what podocalyxin is interacting with in embryonal carcinoma cells. Protein sequencing data reveal that glucose-3 transporter, the testis and brain-specific glucose transporter, copurifies with podocalyxin in purified protein fractions from embryonal carcinoma stem cells. Immunoprecipitation experiments with antiglucose-3 transporter and podocalyxin antibody confirm a stable complex exists in detergent extracted protein lysates. Podocalyxin may be functioning as an anchoring protein for this plasma membrane glucose transporter in stem cells. Current studies are underway to determine if podocalyxin and the transporter are interacting directly or if other proteins, interacting through the PDZ-binding motif, are tethering podocalyxin to the transporter. We will further e xplore if there is any critical function for this complex in pleuripotent stem cells. We are also testing this testis cancer model as an example of human pleuripotent stem cell differentiation. This is based on the fact that embryonal carcinoma (EC) is a pleuripotent stem cell derived from human germ cell tumors. As noted above, all human pleuripotent cells share common stem cell defining markers which include TRA 1-60 and TRA 1-81 antigens which disappear from the stem cell surface upon differentiation. We have previously shown that our molecule of interest, podocalyxin , is the molecular carrier of TRA 1-60/TRA 1-81 antigens on EC. Furthermore, podocalyxin has been recently identified as a tumor marker of several distinct human cancers (as well as a marker of undifferentiated human embryonal stem cell lines). We have shown that retinoic acid induced differentiation of EC is associated with a modification of podocalyxin in which the TRA 1-60/TRA 1-81 components are lost. Further studies on these mechanisms are underway. Clinical Research Clinical research within the Division of Urology is very active. It involves not only urologic oncology and associated components but also outcom es analysis and education and teaching aspects, which is noted in the bibliography. Part of this stems from the initiation of our new urologic \"Community Clinic\" which is being used as a model for urologic care for unrestricted socioeconomic back grounds and is being developed as a teaching model for medical students and residents learning all new aspects of urologic care including office practice and economics.

Michael Scho pperle Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2005 Division of Urology 118 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center DIVISIONAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS OVER THE PAST YEAR Research Accomplishments We completed another phase of work on Gp200, which is a sialomucin expressed on embryonal carcinoma cells. This next installment of work has identified and sequenced the Gp200 protein which has been identified as podocalyxin. To our surprise and delight, we have discovered that glut-3 (which is a glucose transporter isoform found in human testis and brain) copurifies with podocalyxin; thus, podocalyxin and glut-3 transporter form a stable complex in EC cells. The basis for this interaction is not known, however podocalyxin has a PDZ-binding site in its intracellular domain that may play a role in forming protein-protein complexes. Further work is now planned looking at the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of a podocalyxin and glut-3 complex and provide some insight into why a glucose tr ansporter is interacting with a sialomucin in cancer cells. This work is also being developed to understand the effect of differentiation on the expression on embryonal stem cell marker TR A-1-60 as it is expressed on podocalyxin. Basically upon differentiation of EC stem cells the TRA-1-60 marker is lost. Results now show that antibodies to TRA-1-60 and podocalyxin recognize the 200 kilodalton TRA-1-60 stem cell antigen in protein preps of undifferentiated EC cells. However protein blots of undifferentiated EC cells exposed to retinoic acid reveal that the TRA-1-60 epitope is no longer detectable with TRA-1-60 antibodies. This model is being developed as a previously used EC based differentiation model adapte d to stem cell research.

Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2005 Division of Urology 120 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2005 Division of Urology Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 121 Sandra M. Gaston, PhD My laboratory is focused on characterizing the individual biological differences that can influence the clinical behavior of human can cers, with a major emphasis on prostate cancer. We are fortunate to have access to we ll-documented human clinical samples, and we have developed a number of innovative technologies that allow us to perform detailed molecular analyses of these specimens without compromising patient care. These include a set of tissue print and print-phoresis technologies that allow us to generate spatial- molecular maps of tumor markers in needle biopsies and surgical specimens while preserving the tissue for diagnostic histopathology. Currently, we are utilizing our tissue print technologies to investigate the molecular events that differentiate locally invasive prostate cancer from indolent tumors. We are also using tissue prints to map gene expression profiles that corres pond to specific prostate ca ncer phenotypes that can by imaged in human patients using advanced MRI techniques. These efforts have produced a set of new biomarkers that may ultimately be useful in the management of patients with prostate cancer. My laboratory has also developed a set of micro-bioassays that allow us to evaluate bioavailable androgens in complex biological fluids. In an animal model, our bioassays can measure changes in bioavailable serum androgen in response to soy based dietary supplements (in this mode l, bioavailable serum androgen, as measured by bioassay, is distinct from total and free serum testosterone). We found that our bioassay detected decreases in bioavailable serum androgen that were associated with inhibition of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer by soy dietary supplements; serum total and free testosterone showed no such association. Currently we are investigating the relationship between bioavailable serum androgen (as m easured by bioassay) and androgen-dependent gene expression in cell culture models of prostate cancer. We anticipate that that this strategy may have translational applications in the design of pharmacological and dietary interventions for prostate cancer patients who want to incorporate complementary therapies in to their cancer care program. Another focus of my laboratory is to use human semen samples, collected in the Andrology laboratory, to determine individual differences in the susceptibility to mitochondrial toxins, as measured by the effects of these toxins on sperm mitochondrial respiration and motilit y. Using this approach, we have identified a set of polymorphisms in the mitochondrial ATP synthetase that may be particularly important in determining both therapeutic and toxic responses to specific inhibitors of cell respiration.

Gaston, PhD DIVISIONAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS OVER THE PAST YEAR Research Accomplishments With NIH and intramural research support, my laboratory has continued to advance the development of a set of novel tissue printing technologies that support the mol ecular analysis of human tissue specimens. Our tissue print techniques allow us to transfer a microscopic laye r of cells and extracellular ma trix from the surface of a fresh tissue specimen onto nitrocellulose membranes, creating a \"molecular xero x\" which preserves the specimen for histopathology. We have combined tissue print techniques with specific protein and RNA/DNA detection methods to generate two-dimensional maps of molecular markers in radical prostatectomy specimens, and these maps have allowed us to identify clusters of molecular markers that co-localize with sites of microscopic invasion of cancer into the prostate capsule. This year, we published some of our major findings on markers of tumor invasion of the prostate capsule and an overview of our tissue printing techniques in Nature Medicine (see the Bibliography for reference details). Because our tissue print techni ques do not damage tissue specimens, we ha ve been able to u tilize this approach to obtain molecular marker profiles from human prostate needle biopsies. Prostate needle biopsies are key diagnostic specimens that must be submitted in their entirety for surgical pathology and are thus not usually available for molecular marker analys is. In previous studies, we used biopsy cores obtained from radical prostatectomy specimens as model specimens to demonstrate that we could generate both mRNA and protein marker profiles from biopsy tissue prints while preserving the cores for standard H&E and immunohistochemical studies. This last year, we significantly improved the efficiency of our print RNA extraction and have now achieved high quality gene e xpression profiles on Affymetrix microarrays using RNA obtained from prints from single biopsy cores. These important technical milestones have allowed us to move forward with a pilot translational research protocol fo r tissue print analysis of diagnostic prostate needle biopsies. This protocol will allow us to capture mol ecular markers in prostate tissues from a much broader range of patients than can be represented in tissue bank s that rely upon radical prostatectomy specimens. Our biopsy print RNAs represent a significant new resource for the biomarker development efforts currently underway in our laboratory and in the la rger prostate cancer research community. With support from General Electric Industry Sponsore d Research, we have used tissue prints to produce \"molecular whole mounts\" of radical prostatectomy specimens that can be mapped point-to-point with structures visualized in vivo by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectra (MRS). We have collaborated with Dr. Robert Lenkinski and other investigators in the BIDMC MRI/MRS program to profile the patterns of mRNA expression that underlie the MRI/MRS choline peak that is frequently observed in prostate cancer. The genes that regulate choline meta bolism include several that have been identified as Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2005 Division of Urology Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 123 \"druggable\" targets for new anti-cancer compounds. Recently, we have identified an animal model of prostate cancer that appears to reca pitulate some of the tumor-associated changes in choline metabolism that are observed in human patients, and this year we received a DOD prostate can cer research grant to support the development of this animal model for the pre-clini cal study of the molecular mechanisms that produce MRI/MRS visible changes in tumor choline metabolism. Our tissue print \"molecular whole mounts\" of radical prosta tectomy specimens have also allowed us to generate gene expression maps of the angiogenic processes in human prostate cancer that result in MRI visible tumor- associated changes in tissue perfusion, as visualized in vivo by dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Recen tly, we succeeded in obtaining Affymetrix microarray data that has allowed us to begin to compile a gene expression \"signature\" of DC E-MRI positive prostate cancers. These studies are an important component of a larger effort to interpret pr ostate DCR-MRI images in terms of the biological and clinical sub-types of human prostate cancer. Mitochondrial toxicity can present a si gnificant limitation to the clinical a pplication of new therapeutic agents, and current pre-clinical models are inadequate to effi ciently screen for this adverse activity. Because the motility of mammalian spermatozoa is exquisitely sensitiv e to the status of the mitochondria in the sperm midpiece, we have developed a novel in vitro bioassay that utilizes motile spermatozoa to detect individual differences in susceptibility to drugs and toxins that inhi bit mitochondrial respiration. Utilizing both clinical samples and samples from an animal model (domestic boars), we have identified individuals whose pattern of sensitivity or resistance to specific classes of mitochondria l toxins could have important clinical consequences. Currently, we are characterizing genetic polymorphisms that we have found to be associated with increased sensitivity to the drug oligomycin. We anticipate that this study will provide proof-of-principle for a new pharmacogenomic screening strategy that can be used to identify the human chromosomal and/or mitochondrial alleles that give rise to individual differences in sens itivity/resistance to specific inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration.

Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2005 Division of Urology Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 125 Ann A. Kiessling, PhD Robert C. Eyre, MD Paul Church, MD Basic Research The long-term goals of our research are to understand tissue specificity and controls on gene and retrovirus expression in genitourinary tract tissues and in embryos. Studies of HIV infection of male GU tract tissues began over 20 years ago with the first measurements of viral burden in seminal plasma from men with AIDS. The immune privilege of male GU tract tissues led to the hypothesis that semen- producing organs could be an isolated sanctuary of HIV disease. Originally controversial, this concept is now broadly accepted. The work has lead to studies of specific immunologic features of prostate, seminal vesicles and epididymis. Results to date suggest that the role of the prostate in immune- protection of spermatozoa may relate to th e disease predisposition of the prostate in general, including bacterial infections and cancer. In addition, the unique population of tissue-specific macrophages in seminal vesicles and epididymis that play a role in their normal development and function, may also serve as hosts for HIV infection. If so, they may be important life-long reservoirs of infection, difficult to penetrate by anti-retroviral drugs. Current focus: (1) Genetic and phylogenetic analyses of HIV genes cloned from paired specimens of blood and semen contributed by study subjects in a five-year longitudinal study design . To date, we have sequenced and analyzed approximately 1200 clones of HIV genes, including envelope, protease, and reverse transcriptase genes. The genetic analyses have illustrated unique clustering patterns of HIV quasispecies isolated from paired blood and semen specimens from long term study subjects. These findings support and extend the concept, proposed by this laboratory over 20 years ago, that semen producing organs are a sequestered focus of HIV infection, separate from blood. Importantly, in the present study, several study subjects have demonstrated th e appearance of therapy resistance-conferring mutations in semen before they appear in blood. More recent analyses of HIV envelope genes have rev ealed compartmentalization of syncytium-inducing virus species (utilize chemokine receptor non-syncytiu m-inducing virus species (utilize chemokine receptor CCR5). This confirms and extends reports from other la boratories that HIV variants which utilize CCR5 receptors to gain access to host cells are the sexua lly transmitted virus species. Lymphoc ytes express high levels of CXCR4 receptors, whereas monocytes and macrophages express pr edominantly CCR5 receptors. As infection progresses, blood HIV variants mutate to express envelopes that pr eferentially bind to CXCR4 rath er than CCR5. This switch in virus tropism is due to point mutations at one or two amino acid residues (S306R or E320K,R) in the V3 loop of HIVenv, and marks a turning point in disease progression due to increased levels of infection and loss of CD4+ lymphocytes incorporated into lymph node syncytia. The switch in virus tropism has traditionally been attributed to the high error rate inherent in the virus reverse transcriptase, but more recent studies have revealed another possibility. A family of deaminases, CEM15 (APOBEC3G), function as an innate cellular defense mechan against retroviral infection. CEM15 deaminates cytosine in the nascent DNA strand synthesized by viral reverse transcriptase during the process of infection. The resulting uracil residue triggers destruction of the nascen t DNA strand by intracellular DNAses. If, however, the nascent DNA is not destroyed, the positive strand has an adenosine substitution for the guanosine residue that formerly paired with the cytosine. To determine if such mutations influence disease progression, we have analyzed two subsets of our HIV sequence data: 53 unique sequences of the V3 loop of Gp120 from a long-term non-progressor and 82 unique sequences of protease from a man who developed therapy resistance at 32 months of treatment. The logistics of archiving and analyzing a growing data se t of gene sequences have necessitated the development of a custom database, which has been recently completed in MySQL. We have begun to use the database as the starting point for sequence analyses. Dr. Ann Kiessling Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2005 Division of Urology 126 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center We have more recently created a public database, http://www.lrb.med.harvard.edu , in which we have compiled all of the published HIVenv sequences from semen. We included HIVenv sequences from paired blood specimens when available. This is the first public database of its kind and is providing background for understanding the most significant HIV host cells in semen pr oducing organs, as well as for the design of vaccines targeting semen transmitted disease. (2) Immunology of male GU tract tissues with emphasis on the prostate, seminal vesicles and epididymis . Understanding immune controls in these tissues will provide important insights into not only sexually transmitted diseases, but also specific gland pathologies, such as prostatitis and prostate cancer. Previous studies used mouse model systems to characterize the tissue distribution of leukocyte subsets in testis, epididymis, and seminal vesicles. More recent studies have attempted parallel experiments in human tissues. The figure illustrates immunostaining (red-brown color) of human epididymis and seminal vesicles for marker, CD45, and the tissue-specific macrophage marker , CD97 (Figure 1). These are possible host cells for HIV infection. Several lines of evidence, including work from this laboratory, indicate the prostate is immunosuppressed. This characteristic could play an important role in prostate di seases, such as prostatitis and prostate cancer. We have previously reported that prostatitis may drive HIV disease by promoting the development of therapy resistance mutations. For these reasons, we have begun to explore the bacterial species present in prostatic tissues. We have used PCR amplification of bacterial ribosomal gene sequences, followed by sequencing the PCR products and identification through GenBank searches. The work has begun with two cohorts of patients, one group undergoing fertility assessment, and another group undergoing vasectom y. Pre-and post-vasectomy specimens have allowed the comparison of specimens w ith and without contribution from the epididymis. We are in the process of compiling the information for publication. We have invested considerable time in developing a reference library of bacterial DNA sequences amplifiable from laboratory reagents, a problem known to haunt this line of investigation. To date, we have amassed a total library of approximately 200 rDNA gene sequences. (3) Endogenous retrovirus expression in male urogenital The human genome contains more retrovirus-related sequences (45%) than the mouse genome The first retrovirus identified was an endogenous retrovirus expressed by placental cells - in vivo and in vitro. The physiologic significance of the human endogenous retrovirus repertoire is poorly understood, bu t there is a growing awareness of the mobility of genomic elements and their role in cancer. A full-length human endogenous retrovirus (HERV-L) appears to be currently active in the human genome. The mouse counterpart, MERV-L, also appears to be active in the mouse genome, and is a likely candidate for the highly epididymal specific retrovirus expression described by his laboratory over a decade ago. For this reason, we have undertaken a prelim inary survey of a library of male mouse tissue RNAs for expression of MERV-L. Interestingly, it appears to be expressed in a variety of tissues as both mRNA and cytoplasmic cDNAs. Th is work is on-going. (4) We have established a collaboration with the Southwest Biomedical Research Foundation to examine biopsies of tissues from long-term HI V-infected ma le chimpanzees . The goal of this work is to supplement the information we are obtaining in the longitudinal study of paired semen and blood samples from our HIV-infected cohort. The first experiment is planned for September, 2006.

DIVISIONAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS OVER THE PAST YEAR Research Accomplishments The longitudinal genetic and phylogenetic analyses of HI V genes are now proceeding rapidly. The results to date indicate that male GU tract organs are a clinically important reservoir of HIV disease in men, including those on therapy. To establish tissue specific reserv oirs of disease, we are initiating a collaboration with Southwest Biomedical Research Foun dation to analyze tissue biopsies from HIV-infected chimpanzees. The novel class of macrophages in male mouse and human tissues appear to play a fundamental role in organ function. This could have broad application to understan ding the physiology of the prostate, seminal vesicles, and epididymis, as well as their role as reservoirs of HIV infection. The work in the mouse has now been published and the human work is on-going. We have completed a pilot survey of male mouse genita l tract RNAs and DNAs for presence and expression of the endogenous retrovirus, MERV-L. This work formed the basis for the R21 application submitted in Jan., 2005. We have instituted pilot studies to detect bacteria in semen and prostate tissues using PCR-amplification of bacterial ribosomal RNA gene sequences.

Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2005 Division of Urology Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 129 Aria Olumi, MD Basic Research PROJECT 1: Stromal-Epithelial Interactions Regulate Development of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). Development, growth, and tumorigenesis in the prostate are closely regulated by stromal- epithelial interactions. This research project has as its aim to identifying signal transduction pathways that are involved in stormal-epithelial interactions, to enable a better understanding of normal prostate biology and of the pathogenesis of prostatic disease. We hypothesize that the expression of particular stromal genes/proteins is one component that regulates development, growth, and survival of prostatic epithelial cells. It is our goal to determine if BPH results from the altered expression of stromal genes/proteins in adulthood. Jun-family proteins, which are early tran scription factor molecules, have been shown to regulate stromal-epithelial interactions via paracrine modulation of epithelial signaling pathways in other tissues. Jun-family member proteins have also been shown to play an important role in development of the genitourinary organs. Differential expression of Jun-family members in the prostatic stroma may regulate survival or death signals in prostatic epithelial cells. Thus, this project focuses on the way in which Jun-family-mediated paracrine signals from stromal cells regulates proliferation, cell death, and differentiation in pros tatic epithelial cells. These studies will improve our understanding of stromal-epithelial interactions that may lead to BPH in adulthood. PROJECT 2: Molecular Mechanisms of Developing Resistance to Trail-Induced Apoptosis in Prostate Cancer. TNF-related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand (TRAIL) has been shown to induce apoptosis in a variety of tumorigenic and transformed cell lines but not in normal cells, hen ce making TRAIL an ideal cancer therapeutic agent with minimal cytotoxicity. FLICE Inhibitory Protein (c-FLIP) is an important regulator of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. We have demonstrated that persistent expression of c-FLIP(L) is inversely correlated with the ability of TRAIL to induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. In a series of correlative and functional studies we have shown that persistent expression of c-FLIP(L) is necessary and sufficient to regulate sensitivity to TRAIL mediated apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Deciphering th e molecular mechanisms of resistance to TRAIL can improve the efficacy of pro-apoptotic agents in treatment of malignancies. Clinical Research PROJECT: Hypogonadism and Association with Diagnosis and Outcome of Patients with Prostate Cancer. Androgens regulate normal prostate development and prostate cancer progression. We have previously shown a paradoxical link of serum total and Free-T levels with prosta te cancer. The purpose of this project is to evaluate whether hypogonadism is associated with high grade pr ostate cancer, to examine the relationship between Free- Testosterone, PSA, and age of diagnosis, and to determine whether Free-T levels can be used as predictors for prostate cancer recurrence after surg ical therapy for prostate cancer.

LoGerfo, MD Basic Research Vascular Surgery Research Laboratory - Dr. Frank W. LoGerfo, MD (Laboratory Director) The vascular surgery research laboratory has been extensively involved in three main areas of vascular biology research: 1) evaluating mechanisms responsible for prosthet ic graft failure, 2) developing novel biomaterial surfaces, and 3) prevention of intimal hyperplasia in vein grafts. Anastomotic intimal hyperplasia (AIH) is the most common cause of delayed prosthetic arterial graft failure, and delaye d failure of vein grafts. As graft healing occurs, genes are either up- or down-regulated as compared to a quiescent arterial wall. We study altered gene expression that results in cellular proliferation, migration, and extracellular matrix production by smooth muscle cells, leading to AIH. Differential gene expression is assessed using various techniques such as, microarray analysis, qPCR and immunohistochemistry. Laser-Capture Microdissection (LCM), a relatively new technology developed by the National Institutes of Health, which is available at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. We have now established proficiency with LCM, a tool designed to isolate homog eneous populations of cells for genetic analysis. This technique allows direct microscopic visualization and isolation of selected cell populations from frozen tissue sections and permits selection of cells within a chosen ar ea of tissue. The significance and unique aspect of this work is that our group is the first to identify specific genes that are altered following prosthetic arterial grafting and vein grafting in vivo and to examine their role in the cellular environment using various in vitro cell culture assays. This information is now being used to identify targets for RNA silencing. We have established our ability to silence RNA in cell culture and in the vein graft wall. We are working towards systems for RNA silencing that will be practical for intraoperative use. For biomaterials research, we have designed and patented several novel biomaterial surfaces. An infection-resistant ionic polyurethane was developed in Phase I and II STTR grants in which quinolone antibiotics were incorporated into the polymer using textile dyeing techniques, with this surface demonstrating antimicrobial activity both in vitro and in vitro . This biomaterial can be used to comprise a wide range of implantable devices such as catheters, wound dressings and vascular grafts, avenues that are currently being explored. A similar ionic polyurethane was then employed to seal FDA-approved knitted Dacron vascular graf ts using a patented perfusion technology. As part of a Phase II STTR grant, these sealed vascular grafts were evaluated at various acute and chronic time periods using a canine carotid arterial grafting model. A porcine cardiac surgical model to evaluate a novel infection-resistant Dacron prosthetic valve sewing cuff with optimum antimicrobial properties is currently in the development stages in order to complete the objectives of a Phase II SBIR grant. We have also developed in vitro, as described in our Phase I STTR proposal, a novel small-diameter nanofibr ous polyurethane vascular graft via electrospinning technology. Lastly for metallic implants comprised of titanium such as bone joints and dental posts, we have completed early development of a novel titanium surface wi th mitogenic properties via covalent linkage of bone morphogenic protein-2 (an osteoblast mitogen). Recently we have developed a surface including Activated protein C to prevent thrombosis and to stimulate cellular healing of the Dacron arterial grafts. This past year two new scientists joined our group. Leena Pradhan, PhD, came from Tulane University with expertise in endothelial cell biology. Her administrative roles include oversight of our research training programs for residents and medical students. In addition, she will spearhead the involvement of our laboratory in translational research related to the pathobiology of ulceration in the Diabetic foot. Our initial focus is on the role of neuropeptides and the relationship between neuropathy and ischemia. This work is in collaboration with Aristidis Veves, M.D., from our division of Podiatry. The second scientist to join us is Sheng-Quian Wu, PhD, w ho joined us from Dr. William Aird's laboratory. Dr Wu is developing models of biologically active artific ial surfaces to prevent clot formation and to enhance biocompatibility. Vascular Immunobiology Laboratory - Christiane Ferran, MD, PhD (Laboratory Director) Most of my time effort, i.e. eighty five per cent, is devote d to Research. My major research interests are in the field of vascular biology mainly intimal hyperplasia as well as the micro and macrovascular complications of diabetes, transplantation including xenotransplantation and islet transplantation as well as autoimmune diabetes, acute liver failure and liver regeneration. More specifically, the work in my laboratory is focused on the understanding of the function (s) of the anti-apoptotic genes A20, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and A1 in different cell types, their relationship to the pathophysiology of diseases and their potential therapeutic use in organ transplantation, diabetes, atherosclerosis, Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2005 Division of Vascular & Endovascular Surgery 140 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center diabetic vasculopathy and liver regeneration. This interest is based on our original finding that these genes, mainly A20 serve a broad cytoprotective function in endothelial cells (EC), islets and hepatocytes and an atheroprotective function in smooth muscle cells (SMC). Expression of A20 in endothelial cells, islets and hepatocytes not only protects the cells from apoptosis by interrupting the activation of the caspase cascade but also exerts a broad anti-inflammatory purpose by blocking activation of the transcription factor NF- B. Uniquely A20 also promotes hepatocyte proliferation hence liver regeneration by down-regulating the cell cycle brake p21 waf1. In addition, we have recently demonstrated that A20 also increases the expression of peroxisome proliferators associated receptor a (PPAR ), which adds to its anti-inflammatory effect in hepatocytes, and unveil its role in regulating lipid metabolism. These novel findings are strong proof that A20 based therapies may be highly beneficial for patients presenting with severe liver damage but who still have a fraction of viable hepatocytes. Protecting this reduced functional liver mass in the face of ongoing inflammation would meet metabolic demands and allow enough time for regeneration. Expression of A20 is particularly promising for reducing the donor graft size necessary for living donor liver transplantation, allowing the safe use of steatotic organs, and permitting extensive liver resection for the cure of neoplasia. Expression of A20 in SMCs on the other hand inhibits thei r proliferation and sensitizes neointimal (i.e. the major component of atherosclerotic lesions), but not medial SMC, to apoptosis through a novel NO dependent mechanism. A20 fulfills most of the criteria required for an ideal atheroprotective therapy that confers an athero-resistant phenotype to both EC and SMC. We propose that A20 based therapies hold strong promise for the prevention and cure of vascular neointimal disease including atherosclerosis, transplant arteriosclerosis, in-stent restenosis and diabetic vasculopathy. This hypothesis is strengthened by our recent demonstration of impaired expression of A20 in failed vein grafts of diabetic patients that could account for their increased susceptibility to atherosclerosis. We have preliminary evidence that expression of the \"atheroprotective\" protein A20 in the two major target cells of hyperglycemic damage within the vessel wall i.e. Endothelial (EC) and smooth muscle (SMC) cells, is blunted by high glucose (HG) in vitro and uncontrolled hyperglycemia in vivo. Altered A20 expression in face of HG stems from its post-translational modification by O-glycosylation (a newly recognized, key post-translational modification), which marks it for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome (Figure 1). Glucose- mediated degradation of A20 in EC/SMC promotes their acquisition of a pro-atherogenic phenotype, contributing to accelerated atherosclerosis in DM. In a similar vein, we have breakthrough evidence that A20 is a negative regulator of angiogenic pathways in EC, both upstream and downstream of VEGF. Expression of A20 in EC inhibits EC tube formation, in vitro, through blockade of PKC II and ERK1/2 activation while enhancing VEGF mediated AKT phosphorylation. As such, its degradation in the face of high glucose, also contributes, through increased angiogenic, to diabetic retinopathy. Restoring adequate levels of the \"atheroprotective\" and \"anti-angiogenesis\" protein A20, in the face of high glucose/hyperglycemia, should protect from the macro and microvascular complications of diabetes. Clinical Research Clinical Research in Vascular Surgery -Allen Hamdan, MD The clinical research component of the Vascular Division continues to be very vibrant. One of the main problems in the past year was a changing over and updating of our database, which caused some significant delays in entering data as well as computer problems. With hard work by a number of people in the Division, including Lynn Francis and Haig Panossian, we have been able to rectify most of the issues and now can go forward. Another significant Figure 1 Dr. Christiane Ferran Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2005 Division of Vascular & Endovascular Surgery Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 141 addition to our Division has been Dr. Marc Schermerhorn who is Section Chief for Endovascular Surgery. He has a strong increase in outcomes and through his efforts has spearheaded our joining the Society of Vascular Surgery registry for carotid stents as well as the Northern New England group that follows all major vascular interventions. This will allow us to be on the forefront of divisions in regards to understanding our own outcomes as well as being able to publish them and to provide patients as well as insurers with that information. Another significant addition was the hiring of Despina Hoffman as our Research Coordinator. Jennifer Lambert received her Nurse Practitioner's License and has stayed in the Division, but has stepped down as our Research Coordinator. Despina brings an incredible research background, mainly in cancer research, but has significant expertise in running clinical trials.

LoGerfo, MD Graft Failure: Anastomotic intimal hyperplasia (AIH) remains the most common cause of delayed prosthetic arterial graft failu re, a consequence of focal, unregulated gene expression. As graft healing occurs, genes are either up or down-regulated compared to a quiescent arterial wall. Our hypothesis is that altered gene expression results in cellular proliferation, migration, and extracellular matrix production by smooth muscle cells leading to AIH. Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2005 Division of Vascular & Endovascular Surgery Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 143 Our continued investigation will assess gene expression at different time points (24 and 48 hours; 7, 14, 30, and 60 days) after surgical implantation of ePTFE 6mmID prosthetic grafts in our common carotid artery canine model. Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure 2: Histological cross section of normal common carotid artery (Control). Figure 3: Distal anastomosis at 60 days. (H& E / 1X). Figure 4: Histological cross section of distal anastomosis at 60 days and LCM of neointima (SMC) at the Graft luminal surface.(Unstained /1x). To date, we have completed all surgical implantations and have collected specimens for all time intervals (n=3 per time interval). Once specimens were harvested, frozen sections of normal common carotid artery (control, Figure 2) and the distal anastomosis (Figure 3) were generated for Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM). Smooth muscle cells from the neointima and control arterial wall were dissected out through LCM (Figure 4), RNA was extracted and amplified for Affymetrix microarray analysis with qPCR validation on control arterial wall and neointima to facilitate localization of altered gene expression over time (7, 14, 30, and 60 days). At present we are completing our two remaining time points (24 and 48 hours) for LCM, RNA extraction, amplification and qPCR validation. We plan to have all samples ready for Microarrays by March 2006. Protein expression will be examined using immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. We believe identifying alterations in gene expression, their time courses, cellular localization and computational analysis will provide a valuable guide to a comprehensive understanding of AIH. Prevention of Intimal Hyperplasia in Vein Grafts : Intimal hyperplasia in arterialized vein bypass grafts is a significant cause of vein graft stenosis and delayed graft failure. Injury at the time of implantation or as a consequence of transplantation into the high pressure arterial system may contribute to these delayed events. Alterations in gene expression accompany implantation and arterialization injury. These alterations lead to intimal hyperplasia, including transformation of endothelial cells to an inflammatory state and initiating migration and transformation of smooth muscle cells from the contractile to secretory states thus creating the lesion of intimal hyperplasia. It is our hypothesis that silencing of genes upregulated by injury to the vein wall will diminish intimal hyperplasia. Furthermore, gene silencing can be accomplished within the constraints of operating room conditions. We have demonstrated the ability to identify candidate genes associated with intimal hyperplasia and our ability to knockdown gene expression with siRNA. Using LCM we have separated genetic events in the endothelium from those in smooth muscle. Currently we are applying these technologies to (1) systematically identify silencing targets, (2) to silence target genes in vitro, (3) to silence target genes under surgical conditions, (4) to demonstrate inhibition of intimal hyperplasia in vein grafts in vivo. We are performing studies in human tissue and in canine models as well as in vitro using human smooth muscle cells and human coronary artery endothelial cells. In 2005, the work of Dr. Thomas Monahan characterized the contributions of two novel target genes identified by our lab, cadherin 11 (CDH11) and the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate pathologic in vitro phenotypes associated with intimal hyperplasia and identified both as promising targets for ther apeutic gene silencing in vein grafts. These studies resulted in three national presentations, two upcoming journal submissions, and a provisional patent for the use of MARCKS as a target for inhibiting restenosis after vasc ular interventions. The work of Nicholas Andersen Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2005 Division of Vascular & Endovascular Surgery 144 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center focused on translating siRNA technology for use in vascular surgical procedures, including the validation of siRNA technology in vascular cells cultured in vitro to the rapid transfection of human vein segments under operating room conditions. Promising results were obtained on both fronts and accepted by two national meetings for presentation in 2006. Continued progress on the inquiry outlined above will greatly strengthen the application of gene silencing to clinical problems in vascular surgery, and broaden our understanding of vascular wall biology. Infection Resistant Prosthetic Valve Sewing Cuffs : Bacterial infection is a major complication associated with implantation of prosthetic valves for cardiac valve replacement. Infections are localized to the biomaterial/tissue interface leading to cuff and annular abscess formation. An infection-resistant knitted polyester (Dacron) cuff material was developed in our laboratory with optimum antimicrobial properties via thermo fixation (pad/heat) dyeing of the antibiotic ciprofloaxin (Cipro). Application of this technology resulted in slow, sustained antibiotic release without the use of exogenous binders. Our hypothesis is that the application of quinolone antibiotics, such as Cipro, to Dacron sewing cuffs using our proprietary dyeing technology will significantly reduce cardiac valve infections when challenged with a significant bacterial innoculum. Figure 5 Figure 6 Figure 5: Surgical incision and sewing cuff r ing implantation into the ascending aorta. Figure 6: Closure of the ascending aort a with sewing cuff ring in place. At present, we are conducting our in vivo studies by implanting unmodified (clinical standard/control) and Cipro-dyed sewing cuffs in our porcine ascending aorta infection model (Figure 5 and 6). We will assess control and Cipro-dyed Dacron sewing cuffs via histological/microbiological techniques and determine physical properties of Cipro-dyed sewing cuffs post-explanation. A Nanofibrous Biocomposite Small-Diameter Graft: no small-diameter (< 5mm internal diameter) vascular prosthesis approved for clinical use in small vessel reconstruction. Current prostheses are not capable of emulating the biological and physical properties of the normal arterial wall, resulting in high failure rates. Our hypothesis is that the next generation of prosthetic arterial grafts will have to possess multiple structural and biological properties that mimic some of those proc esses inherent to native arteries in order to prevent complications such as thrombosis from occurring. We have designed a new, nanofibrous biocomposite small- diameter vascular graft comprised of Dacron and Type IV collagen (ESDC). bound to the ESDC surface (ESDC-rHir-VEGF). These surface bound agents were biologically active as determined via specific in vitro assays and showed stability under simulated arterial flow conditions. Our goal of this Phase II prject is to assess blood permeation and graft patency/healing of the ESDC-rHir-VEGF graft using a canine arterial grafting model (femoral artery interposition). Development of a Biologically-Active Prosthetic Graft: Surface thrombosis and lack of cell in growth lead to prosthetic vascular graft implantation failure. Biological modification of existing materials remains one of the promising approaches to overcome the problems. Activated protein C (APC) is a potent anticoagulant and the ligand for endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR), which is primarily expressed on endothelial cells and on some hematopoietic stem cells. This project sets out to test the feasibility of immobilizing APC to Dacron and to evaluate the biocompatibility of APC Dacron. When modified with APC bound to Dacron underwent multi-step modification. Surface bound APC has promising physical and Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2005 Division of Vascular & Endovascular Surgery Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 145 functional stability as tested using a static system and a simulated arterial flow system. The APC bond Dacron surface demonstrated good anti-coagulant activity as indicated by chromogenic assay and clotting assay. An abstract base on our preliminary study has been accepted by the Society for Biomaterial for presentation. A research grant application will be submitted to CIMIT for the fiscal year of 2006. Role of neuropeptides in diabetic foot ulcerations: Abnormal wound healing is a major complication of both type I and type II diabetes and is the most frequent cause of non-traumatic lower limb amputation. Wound healing requires the orchestrated integration of complex biological and molecular events. Inflammation, proliferation, and migration of cells followed by angiogenesis and re-epithelization are essential phases of wound healing. Recently, dysregulation of neuropeptides, such as Substance P (SP) and Neuropeptide Y (NPY), secreted from peripheral nerves have been implicated in abnormal wound healing. The link between wound healing and the nervous system is clinically apparent as peripheral neuropathy is reported in 30-50% of diabetic patients and is the most common and sensitive predictor of foot ulceration. Furthermore, molecular studies have shown SP and NPY levels are reduced in diabetic patients. Receptors for SP are found on relevant wound healing cells including monocytes, mast cells, endothelial cells (ECs) and keratinocytes. SP is known to evoke an acute inflammatory response, consistent with the inflammatory phase of wound healing. It also has a proliferative effect on ECs, an important step in a ngiogenesis. Thus, SP affects numerous phases of wound healing and any dysfunction in the production, release or signaling of SP could impair wound healing. NPY has a similar proliferative effect on ECs, and NPY receptor null mice demonstrate impaired wound healing. Although SP and NPY production and metabolism appear to play a role in diabetic wound healing, the exact molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these complex interactions remain elusive. Our hypothesis is that inadequate levels of neuropep tides such as SP and NPY and/or dysregulation in their signaling pathways leads to abnormal wound healing in diabetes. We are planning on testing this hypothesis in vitro, in vivo, and in human samples obtained from diabetic patients with clinical neuropathy and chronic foot ulcerations. Molecular in vitro studies will be conducted in Human Dermal Microvascular Endothelial Cells (DMVECs) and U-937 monocytes to delineate neuropeptide signaling mechanisms in the setting of high glucose. In vivo studies will be performed in alloxan induced diabetic rabbits in which wounds will be created in the ear and wound closure monitored in the presen ce or absence of exogenous SP and/or NPY. Our novel approach includes rendering the ear neuroischemic prior to wounding and studying the individual and combined contributions of neuropathy and ischemia to diabetic wound healing. In human samples, we will analyze the relationship of plasma and skin neuropeptides with markers of angiogenesis. This study will be critical in determining the role of neuropeptides in clinical human disease. Based on this hypothesis, a grant proposal was submitted by Leena Pradhan to the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation for the Advanced Postdoctoral Fellowship award for the year 2006. Immunobiology Research Center-Christiane Ferran, MD, PhD The past year, we have mainly extended our program to studying the impact of A20 upon diabetic vasculopathy and diabetic retinopathy. Our preliminary results resulted in the discovery that diabetes mellitus impairs the expression of atheroprotective genes such as A20. A20 is blunted in diabetic patients due to metabolic disturbances aggravated by genetically determined factors specific to patients with type I DM. This work has set the basis for a Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation grant aimed at evaluating the role of A20 upon diabetic retinopathy that has already been funded. This work was also the subject of a proposal to the NIH loan repayment program (LRP) submitted by Salvatore Scali MD that is currently under review. Our groundbreaking data on the role of A20 in DV has also set the basis for an NIH grant proposal that has just been submitted aimed at evaluating the role of A20 glycosylation upon the development of DV and of complementary grant proposal submitted to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation on January 16 th 2006. The work on the role of A20 in the development of DV was also the subject of a proposal to the NIH loan repayment program (LRP) that was successfully awarded last year to Gautam Shrikhande MD. We have also been successful in expanding our work demonstrating the beneficial effect of A20 expression in medial smooth muscle in preventing intimal hyperplasia to studying its impact on already established disease. Our data demonstrate that expression of A20 in neointimal smooth muscle cells induces the regression of established lesions via its unique capacity to sensitize neointimal SMC to apoptosis via a NO dependent mechanism. These provocative and exciting results have been finalized in a manuscript now under revision for Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2005 Division of Vascular & Endovascular Surgery 146 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center publication to FASEB journal. This work was the subject of a proposal to the NIH LRP that was successfully awarded to Virendra Patel MD last year. In addition, it has served as a basis to 2 grant proposals . The first one was successfully submitted to the Roche Organ Transplant Research Foundation and funding will begin on January 1 st 2006. The second was submitted as an RO1 application to the NIH. It previously received a priority score of 170 (14.7 percentile) and is currently pending a funding decision. This later work was also submitted in a proposal to the NIH loan repayment program (LRP) that was successfully awarded to Mark D. M. Fisher MD. We have also expanded our work on the effect of A20 upon liver regeneration and demonstrated that this gene has the unique capacity to promote liver regeneration via decreasing the expression of the cell cycle brake p21 waf1. This data has been published in Hepatology. New stimulating data generated, implicating an effect of A20 on the cyclin dependent kinase p21waf1 and PPAR , are solid leads for the competitive renewal of this grant by the end of next year. We have also been successful in expanding our work demonstrating the beneficial effect of A20 expression in medial smooth muscle in preventing intimal hyperplasia to studying its impact on already established disease. Our data demonstrate that expression of A20 in neointimal smooth muscle cells induces the regression of established lesions via its unique capacity to sensitize neontimal SMC to apoptosis via a NO dependent mechanism. These provocative and exciting results have been finalized in two manuscripts submitted for publication to the Journal of Experimental Medicine. This work was also the subject of a proposal to the NIH LRP that was successfully awarded to Virendra Patel, M.D. We also expanded our work on the effect of A20 upon liver regeneration and demonstrated that this gene has the unique capacity to promote liver regeneration via decreasing the expression of the cell cycle brake p21 waf1. Data were presented at the annual BIDMC competition for surgical residents by Christopher Longo, MD and received an award. Results were also finalized in a manuscript submitted for publication in Hepatology. Vascular Surgery Clinical Research-Allen Hamdan, MD Inflammatory marker trial: This is a prospective trial looking at about 300 patients in concert with the Brigham and Women's Hospital under the direction of Dr. Mike Conte. Patients are prospectively followed who undergo vein bypass grafts. A number of inflammatory markers including C reactive protein are evaluated pre- and post-operatively to see if there is any impact on progression of vascular disease. There was a recent acceptance of an abstract on the relation of C reactive protein to perioperative events that we presented at the Society of Vascular Surgery national meeting, which I suspect will be published in the Journal of Vascular Surgery six months later. We continue to actively enroll patients. Crest trial: Dr. Schermerhorn is now the site PI for this trial. It is a randomized trial looking at carotid stent vs. carotid endarterectomy. All of the surgeons are eligible to perform carotid endarterectomy in the trial. Dr. Schermerhorn is eligible to perform endarterectomy as well as carotid stenting. He is one of the few surgeons in the country who has this dual nomination. We will be actively enrolling patients in this very important trial. Capture registry: This is a post-marked release registry to evaluate a carotid stent and embolic protection system. In addition, this allows for us to treat patients with stents and have their procedures covered through the trial, which is a welcome addition to the proper patient. Pivotal trial: We are awaiting final IRB approval of this trial, but basically it will evaluate patients with 4.0 to 5.0 cm. abdominal aortic aneurysms. They will be randomized into an early treatment arm using endovascular stent graft vs. ultrasound and CT surveillance. The intent of this study is to identify patients who are better treated early for aneurysm disease as opposed to standard, which is watchful waiting. We are a number of approximately 70 centers across the country evaluating this issue.

LoGerfo, MD This training program is designed to provide two years of intense basic research training in vascular surgery for academic clinicians. The training program addresses the absence of adequate research training for vascular surgeons as it applies to specific areas of clinical diseas e. This program is in its twelfth year. Trainees pursue a program of research activity supplemented with course work in research design, ethics, statistics and evaluation Formatted: Bullets and NumberingDepartment of Surgery Annual Research Report 2005 Division of Vascular & Endovascular Surgery 150 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center of published research in the areas of molecular and cell biology, biomechanics, coagulation and thrombosis and angiogenesis. Clinically relevant atherogenesis, intimal hyperplasia, prosthetic/host interactions and thrombosis will be the main focus of thes e research projects. Trainees carry out their research projects under the guidance of a faculty advisor selected from 20 renowned vascular researchers based at four Harvard Medical School hospitals (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Brigham and Women's, Children's Hospital (Boston) and Joslin Diabetes Institute) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Upon completion of the program, trainees are capable of indepe ndent research and possess the scientific and research background needed to obtain peer-reviewed grants. Selection of trainees is based on candidate's demonstrated ability and career choice of academic practice. Applicants are resident physicians who have completed either 2/3 years of clinical post-doctoral experience (surgical re sidency) or 5 years of clinical training (i.e. are board eligible). Only those applicants with career goals in academic surgery, with a keen interest in basic research in vascular surgery are compatible. Trainees in the program are not involved in any clinical activities unless research related. Trainee General Surgery Training Program Richard Bafford, MD Brigham and Women's Hospital Thomas S.
