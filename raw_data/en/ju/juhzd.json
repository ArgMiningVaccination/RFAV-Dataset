It is deeply ingrained in all aspects of our culture and dnA. Our speed of innovation, our ability to marry traditional Ayurvedic knowledge with modern-day science, complete focus on quality and high distribution reach have been our key strengths in the marketplace.Innovation @ DaburCorporate overviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial statements24 25 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 The first steps in this journey can be traced back to the year 1919 when dabur established its dedicated Research laboratory for Ayurvedic medicines. since then, it has been a story of continuous innovation from diversification into Ayurvedic and natural Personal Care with the launch of dabur Amla Hair Oil in 1940 to the introduction of India's first packaged and branded Chyawanprash in 1949. The year 1970 saw dabur enter the oral care market with the launch of dabur Lal dant Manjan, a conveniently packaged herbal toothpowder made available at affordable prices. Another major step forward in this journey was our decision to brand and launch an Ayurvedic digestive medicine as Hajmola in 1978. Hajmola, which continues to be the most preferred digestive tablet in the country with its unique chatpata taste, was soon extended to the confectionery market with the launch of Hajmola Candy, which became an instant hit. There have been several such examples over the past century, the most notable among them being dabur's decision to roll out its highly efficacious and popular toothpowder dabur Lal dant Manjan in a paste format with dabur Red Paste, in the year 1995. The launch of R\u00e9al Fruit Juices soon followed in 1997, which pioneered the concept of packaged fruit juices in India. subsequently, dabur also rolled out ethnic cooking pastes and chutneys with the brand Hommade. The year 2004 saw dabur step outside India's shores with a unique game plan to establish a local supply chain and manufacturing base in the overseas countries. While we followed the same brand architecture as in India, with brands like dabur Amla and Vatika, the products introduced under these brands were tailored to suit the needs of the local populace there. This has been one of the key ingredients of our success abroad.the past few months have seen Dabur accelerate its innovation strategy, rolling out over two dozen products with a majority of them being introduced within two months of the Co VID-19 outbreak. a number of these products were fast- tracked to meet the growing consumer need for quality immunity-boosting products in the wake of Co VID outbreak. In addition, the year also saw Dabur expand its presence in the personal and household hygiene space with a slew of new introductions.26 Dabur India LimitedCorporate overviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial statements27 Annual Report 2019-20 The new launches cover the following categories: heaL th CaRe peRSonaL & houSehoLD hYGIene FooDSInteRnatIonaL BuSIneSS peRSonaL CaRe Following are some of the new products launched in the recent months:Corporate overviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial statements28 29 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 1.

While most entertainment channels witnessed a drop in viewership, the national broadcaster doordarshan gained favour from viewers as it started repeat telecast of yesteryears' popular historical serials like Ramayan and Mahabharat with these series topping viewership charts. our response to this changing landscape dabur altered its media mix by discontinuing ads in newspapers, General entertainment Channels and shifting focus to news channels, which were drawing high visibility We increased our focus on marquee events on TV like Prime Minister narendra Modi's Address to the nation and 'Mann Ki Baat' programmes Heavy advertisements were pumped-in on doordarshan, specially on the historical serials like Ramayan and Mahabharat, which were drawing high eyeballs To top it all, we also recrafted our brand communications establishing the Immunity Building, Germ Kill properties of Dabur brands With consumers staying home during the lockdown and consuming more digital media, we also increased our focus on digital and social Media with relevant content around CoronaVirus, lockdowns and protection from germs special social messages and videos were created to thank the frontline Corona Warriors like police personnel, health workers, sanitation workers etc As the original custodian of Ayurveda, dabur and its various Health Care brands put together special educational and public interest videos for social media, highlighting the benefits of Ayurveda in fighting COVId-19, further establishing dabur's credentials in immunity-building arena With no new outdoor shoots possible, we also developed special 'Slice of Life' films from home videos and shot within households using hand-held cameras and mobile phones to reach out to millennials on social media during the lockdown 2.

In addition to immunity-booster , personal hygiene products like hand sanitisers have also today become an essential part of the monthly grocery basket for households. to address this growing consumer need, Dabur fast-tracked the launch of new products across healthcare, home & personal Ca re and Foods categories. Corporate overviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial statements44 45 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 The lockdown put the entire sales system in complete disarray with stockists unable to open their outlets and availability of vehicles, manpower for product delivery emerging as key challenges. With consumers indulging in panic buying of daily use products, most retail outlets were also staring at stockouts in the initial days of the lockdown. to meet these emerging challenges, Dabur overhauled its Go- to-Market strategy and put in place several new steps to ensure uninterrupted supplies of our products. these include: Motivating our stockist network to operate from home and take delivery early in the morning Supplemented Stockist staff with our Sales force deployed third-party delivery vehicles to assist stockists in ensuring timely and uninterrupted supplies to retailers Provided Health Insurance cover to over 2,200 sales personnel at stockists to cover COVId emergencies Incentive scheme launched for delivery boys who report on duty and stockists who open for business Worked closely with state, Central Government to secure physical, e-passes for our sales personnel3.

Within 7-10 days, dabur sought and received permissions to operate its manufacturing units for producing a range of essential items like Hand sanitisers, Hand Wash, disinfectants, Ayurvedic Medicines, Juices, Coconut Water, Honey etc. However, the reverse migration of labour to their respective hometowns impacted availability of trained manpower at the units, which prevented scale-up of operations. Also, non-availability of truck drivers hampered smooth movement of raw material, packing material and finished products. dabur reached out local people in areas around its manufacturing units and even secured permissions from state authorities to hire and transport people from as far away as Jharkhand to its manufacturing units in Jammu, Uttarakhand and Baddi to bridge the gap. t oday, all our manufacturing units are operational and are working at near normal operating capacity. as we commenced operations, several steps were taken to ensure smooth functioning of our units and safety of our workmen. these include: Fumigation of all areas with a disinfectant on a weekly basis Placing hand sanitisers at all areas deploying special buses to transport workers from nearby areas to the plants, with social distancing maintained inside the bus Thermal screening of employees and truck drivers during entry and exit at the security Gate sanitising of delivery vehicles Restricted number of employees travelling together in elevators Regular cleaning of all high contact areas Adequate social distance maintained in cafeteria, including while seated Floor marking in shop floor to ensure social distancing4.

The same holds true for India with the 'Made in India' tag being a key unifying factor for millions of Indian consumers with the power to influence purchase decision. In the days following the COVID outbreak, millions of Indians have rediscovered the power of Ayurveda. The Ministry of AYUSH, in its guidelines, advocated use of Ayurvedic remedies and Yoga to boost your immunity to fight against the pandemic. This was followed by our Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi's clarion call for an Atma Nirbhar Bharat (self-dependent India) and being 'Vocal for Local'. Responding to this call, Dabur rolled out a series of campaigns that not only harnessed India's traditional knowledge like Ayurveda, but also talked about our diversity and our indigenous products that are an integral part of our identity. As a brand, Dabur evokes feelings of Trust, Health and Well-Being in the minds of our consumers. With our 'Vocal for Local' campaign, we are highlighting the Indian roots of Dabur and our 136-year-old heritage of caring for every Indian household's health and well-being. Our brand communications around #Vocal4Local reflect our Ayurvedic and Indian heritage, and our strong sense of pride about 'Made in India, by Indians, for Indians'. These campaigns were promoted on digital media and also on mainstream media like television, particularly news channels. Two videos were specially created as a part of this initiative. The first campaign, with the anthem \"Ye Bharat Hai Hamara, Ye Dabur Hai Hamara\" (https://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=dxZ90b_6AvE), sought to showcase the strong legacy of the various Dabur brands and their role in the everyday lives of our consumers.

I sincerely hope you stay safe and protected from COVID. My heart goes out to the families and friends of all those people whose lives have been impacted by the pandemic. I would also like to take this opportunity to show my immense gratitude to all our frontline heroes - police personnel, doctors, health workers and sanitation workers - for their efforts in keeping us safe. Dabur has also been at the forefront by lending a helping hand in the fight against the disease by supporting various national and local institutions and the central and state governments. The Dabur Group has committed ` 21 crore towards these relief measures. Details of our COVID relief initiatives have been provided in this report. With the COVID pandemic impacting economies, lives and livelihood all over the world, the Company's sales and profits were also impacted during last quarter of the financial year. Despite the COVID impact, Dabur ended FY 2019-20 with a 2% growth in Revenue from Operations at ` 8,704 Crore. Net Profit for the full year stood at ` 1,445 Crore, reflecting a similar level as last year. Excluding exceptional items, Net Profit for the year marked a growth of 5.8%. Before the CoronaVirus outbreak, Dabur was on track to deliver a strong operating performance on the back of Power Brand strategy, aggressive brand-building and distribution enhancement initiatives. The year saw Dabur progress on its growth strategy by investing heavily behind the nine identified Power Brands, majority of which fall in the strategically important health care domain. The strategy paid off with these brands reporting good growth during the year and gaining market share in their respective categories. Details of the Power Brand strategy are presented in the following sections of this report. We also continue d to expand our distribution footprint, particularly in the hinterland, taking up our village coverage to 52,000 villages by the end of March 2020 as against 44,000 villages in March 2019. Our direct retail coverage has also increased from 1.1 million outlets to 1.2 million outlets during the year. With the lockdown restrictions easing now, we are continuing our strategy of distribution expansion and plan to increase the village network to 60,000 villages by the end of the current financial year, besides increasing the direct coverage to 1.5 million outlets over the next 2 to 3 years. Our International business was on track of strong growth before it was impacted by COVID-19. In addition to this crisis, macro-economic slowdown driven by declining oil prices further started to impact our business particularly in the MENA region. We successfully mitigated the impact with a series of localised measures and initiatives and ended the year with strong gains in market shares across most categories. Our International Business reported growth of 4.9% during FY 2019-20. We will continue to leverage our global presence, natural heritage, consumer-relevant innovations and unmatched product portfolio to generate strong profitable growth in our international business. Our brand portfolio, which includes 18 brands with more than one billion rupees in Revenue, remains unmatched in the FMCg industry.Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements50 51 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 science of Ayurveda Since the COVID outbreak, the demand dynamics have undergone a sea change with consumers increasingly seeking Ayurvedic products that build immunity, besides products to meet their personal and household hygiene needs. As the country's largest Ayurvedic products maker, our business is well positioned to address this trend with our portfolio of immunity building products. We have further strengthened this portfolio with the introduction of a whole new range of Immunity Boosters. We have also entered the personal and household hygiene market, details of which have been provided in other sections of this report. As an organisation, we have always believed in the benefits of Ayurveda and have been propagating the goodness of Ayurveda for the past 136 years. In the past year, we have taken several steps to further enhance the popularity of Ayurveda and make it more mainstream which includes launch of contemporary formats, enhanced distribution and visibility and promotion on digital media. Samvaad conferences were organised to discuss Ayurvedic products, processes and new developments in this field with medical professionals. We also organised health camps and doctor meets to disseminate information about the efficacy of Ayurvedic medicines in managing healthcare including lifestyle diseases that are surfacing in current times. Future Ready The nimble-footedness and agility that our management team has displayed in responding to the changing dynamics in the marketplace with a more streamlined portfolio and refreshed positioning to meet the emerging needs of our consumer is indeed commendable. During the year, more than 50 new products have been introduced across categories, a majority of which were launched during and after the lockdown period reflecting a strong and committed effort to mitigate the immediate crisis and emerge from it stronger and Future Ready. Our brand portfolio, which includes 18 brands with more than one billion Rupees in Revenue, remains unmatched in the FMCG industry. With our strong heritage and our unmatched product portfolio, we are confident of effectively managing our business, regardless of the operating environment and relentlessly working towards delivering long-term value for our stakeholders. Caring for environment The Company has a strong commitment towards environment sustainability and social development. We continue to build on this strength by working more proactively in the areas of plastic waste management and community welfare. This year, we expanded our plastic waste management initiative to 25 states, collecting and processing/recycling over 12,000 MT of post-consumer plastic waste, which accounts for around 60% of our plastic waste generation. This is part of our commitment to reducing the impact of our business on the environment and be a responsible corporate citizen. Our commitment to social responsibility is also reflected in the several welfare programmes we run across the country. Details of these activities are provided in other sections of this report. Our biodiversity initiatives also gained pace during the year and Dabur distributed over 19 lakh saplings of medicinal plants free of cost to farmers across the country. Today, we grow these rare medicinal herbs in over 4,800 acres of land spread across the country with over 6,900 farmers benefiting from the exercise. Looking back, I would say FY 2019-20 was not an easy year especially towards the end. But I know that we can count on the experience of our management team and the commitment of our 7,000-plus employees worldwide to weather any storm that comes our way. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our colleagues across the globe for their continued hard work and commitment over the last year, and particularly during the COVID-imposed lockdown. We owe our success to them. They are our true Corona Warriors and their commitment is what drives our business forward during these troubled times and positions us for sustainable growth in the future. We are today a much more agile organisation that is fuelled by the passion and entrepreneurship spirit of our employees. I would also like to extend my gratitude to our distributors, vendors, business associates and our consumers for their continued support and commitment towards Dabur India Ltd. Finally, I thank you, our esteemed shareholders and investors, for your continued trust, confidence and guidance in these trying times. We are committed to investing strongly behind our business and driving it on a strong growth trajectory and we look forward to continuing this rewarding journey together with you in the current fiscal and beyond. Sincerely, Amit Burman ChairmanCorporate OverviewBoard & Management Report 2019-20 Q&A wITh CeO MR. MOhIT MALhOTRA Q. You have just completed the first year of being CEO of Dabur . How was fiscal 2019-20 for you? A. Mr . Mohit Malhotra: The year was going well for us till COVID happened. We set new paradigm of excellence, strengthened the strategic framework, stepped up on innovation and were steadily moving forward on our growth trajectory through most part of the year despite the overall macroeconomic headwinds and demand slowdown in the industry. Our Power Brand strategy has worked well, and our brands continue to outgrow the industry across all categories, winning market share even when category growths are negative in some cases. Our International Business too posted good growth during the first eleven months of the year. Till February 2020, Dabur was on track to deliver around 6% growth in Revenue and 14% growth in Net Profit before exceptionals. However, the onset of CoronaVirus pandemic and nationwide lockdown in March impacted the revenue and profitability severely and we ended FY 2019-20 with a 2% growth in Revenue from Operations and 5.8% growth in Net Profit before exceptional items. Q. COVID-19 has been an unprecedented event globally. How is Dabur handling the business in this pandemic? has there been a tactical change in strategy to cope with this situation? A. MM: To succeed in this uncertain and highly dynamic environment, we needed to be agile and seize opportunities in a very short timeframe. We had to quickly adapt our business approach, mobilise our teams to put in a strong effort despite lockdown restrictions, besides leveraging technology and innovation to address the changing environment and the emerging needs of our consumers. We completely changed the way the organisation worked, adapting the existing policies and procedures to changing times. The situation was so dynamic, that every hour a different decision had to be taken. We put in place a 24x7 war room with our sales, marketing and supply chain teams to share and resolve issues on a real-time basis. As the situation became more complex and we decided to step on gas with innovation, the war room was extended to other functions, including R&D. This is how we were able to launch more than 40 new products, re-purpose the brands and launch extensive campaigns on mainstream media as well as digital platforms during the lockdown period. This has brought about a highly collaborative culture in the organisation, bringing out the inter dependence of all functions and has significantly enhanced the risk-taking ability of our teams. COVID, in fact, has acted as a catalyst for change. We have become much more agile, nimble-footed and quick in our execution. Communication and connecting with partners and business associates have become more seamless today, enabled by technology. Technology has, in fact, gained substantial prominence in the organisation now. With physical order-booking becoming difficult during the lockdown period, we leveraged technology to make the process simpler and seamless for our partners. We rolled out a Mobile App for retailers, commenced order-booking on WhatsApp and activated our Call Centre to take orders from retail outlets across the country. We also saw a major increase in our e-commerce sales and anticipate this channel to continue to gain salience. There has been a steep jump in advertising through digital media and even activities like market research are now becoming digital and online. We believe these initiatives are not just for the short term but will lead to more opportunities for an efficient and technology-enabled working culture in the organisation. COVID has also been a trigger for change in the way we operate our business. We are implementing Continuous Replenishment System (CRS) to manage our inventories better. We have been able to reduce the Our Power Brand strategy has worked well, and our brands continue to outgrow the industry across all categories, winning market share even when category growths are negative in some cases.Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements52 53 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 pipeline inventory by almost 5-6 days. A new module of Drishti, the front-end ERP platform, has been rolled out for majority of our distributors and we are bringing in greater automation in a lot of our functions. In fiscal 2019-20, we had upgraded to SAP HANA, which has enhanced the capability of our IT systems. All these initiatives will make the company more efficient and Future-Ready. Q. what are the key consumer trends you see developing, going forward? A. MM: Health and Hygiene have emerged as the key consumer needs in the post-COVID world. Ayurveda-based preventive healthcare and hygiene - both personal and household - are gaining prominence in the consumer mindspace. People are now more inclined to prophylactic health remedies, especially immunity boosting products. This trend would sustain, going forward. In view of this changing consumer behaviour, we have revamped our portfolio mix with immunity boosting healthcare and hygiene products gaining prominence. Dabur has introduced a slew of innovations under the immunity umbrella to cater to this growing consumer need. We are also conducting clinical trials on Chyawanprash, in addition to prophylaxis studies on Ashwagandha and Giloy, specifically with respect to COVID-19. These studies are expected to generate data to back the efficacy and effectiveness of this Ayurvedic remedy on preventing COVID-19 and also its effect on recovery from COVID and reducing the severity of COVID infection. There is also greater collaboration now between the Public and Private sector. For instance, Dabur is conducting studies for Prophylaxis and management of COVID-19, along with various State Governments and the Ministry of AYUSH. This offers a great opportunity for Dabur to make Ayurveda mainstream and popularise hitherto hidden gems of Ayurveda for prophylactic healthcare. While the demand for hygiene products may moderate once the pandemic subsides, we believe that need for hygiene will get embedded in lifestyle and habits of people. This health crisis has become an inflection point in giving a major fillip to categories such as hand and surface sanitisers, veggie wash and disinfectants and some of these trends are likely to sustain over the longer term. The pandemic has also led to a shift in shopping behaviour of consumers with the propensity for online shopping increasing. Targeting this emerging trend, we are launching a series of new products exclusively for online markets. Q. have you made any change in the way you are looking at innovation and what is the strategy going forward? A. MM: I believe a crisis is not to be wasted. It is, in fact, an opportunity to work harder, strengthen the business with new capabilities and innovations to emerge stronger and further entrench our leadership position in the marketplace. That's exactly what we did with COVID. We have transformed ourselves as an organisation, become more aggressive and fearless. We have also enhanced our risk-taking ability, encouraging our employees to become more entrepreneurial. To support this attitude, trusting people and accepting failures is also important - which is what we are doing. Innovation is critical to our sustained success. To support this, we have not only increased our R&D spends but are also ensuring that innovations are targeted and quick to market. This shift in our Innovation strategy is the reason why we have been able to roll-out more than 40 new products within a span of three months since the COVID outbreak. We are planning to continue adding more products and offer age-old Ayurvedic remedies in convenient and modern formats which will not only increase our repertoire but also provide a better connect with millennials in future. Q. how is your Power brand strategy panning out and have you made any changes in your strategy? A. MM: The Power Brand strategy has been one of the key pillars of our growth strategy. A year back, we had started this journey with 8 Power Brands - Dabur Chyawanprash, Dabur Amla Hair Oil, Tail, Dabur Honitus and Dabur Pudin Hara. We have since expanded this portfolio with the addition of Vatika as an International Power Brand. Together, these 9 Power Brands account for more than 70% of our total Sales. We have been putting disproportionate investments behind these brands to improve visibility, enhance distribution and drive innovation by way of new products, variants and format launches. These focussed initiatives, which have helped these Power Brands improve connect with the millennials and Gen-Z, will continue. The brands continue to grow ahead of their categories and gain market share. We will stay the course with this strategy, which includes building flanker brands for our Power Brands. We started this with Dabur Amla and are now extending it to other Power Brands. Q. what is your strategy for healthcare and how large is the opportunity for this business? A. MM: Dabur is the world's largest Ayurvedic and Natural Healthcare Company. This is a space where Dabur has the right to win, with our portfolio of Ayurvedic Healthcare products that are highly popular and household names in India. We are very excited about the year ahead, particularly with our strong pipeline of product innovation and strong route to market and execution strategy. A majority of our new introductions have been in the healthcare space, where consumers are today seeking products to boost their immunity and fight illnesses. Going forward, we will be further strengthening this portfolio with the launch of a string of Ayurveda-based products in modern, ready-to-use formats. Our aim is to make Ayurveda mainstream. COVID has acted as an inflection point, increasing the relevance of Ayurveda in consumers' minds. As an organisation, we want to structurally change the skew of our product portfolio to give greater prominence to Healthcare, which is also margin accretive, and reduce our reliance on the HPC category. COVID has enabled it, increasing the contribution of Healthcare in our Consolidated Sales. This is a great opportunity for Dabur and is in line with our stated mission of being dedicated to the 'Health and Well-Being of every Household'. There is currently good momentum in healthcare and we will leverage this tailwind to build the business further through innovation, distribution enhancement and higher visibility.Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements54 55 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 At Dabur, we firmly believe that Stakeholder Engagement is critical for the sustainable growth of our business.

As one of the leading consumer goods manufacturers of India, Dabur recognises its role and responsibility to minimise its contribution to Climate Change. We have been addressing the environmental impact of our operations with a strategic and long-term approach. From manufacturing units that produce zero waste water to new systems powered by Solar Energy, we are working to establish frameworks for the efficient use of resources and stable supply of renewable energy. Our stated intent is to move to a phase where all the electricity we consume at our manufacturing units will come from renewable sources.

We continuously seek to not just prevent and minimise generation of waste at our production units, but also work towards waste recycling and use of alternative methods of waste treatment to prevent them from reaching landfill sites. We fully embrace the concept of waste minimisation across the supply chain by following the 3R principle of Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.We have rolled out initiatives that promote awareness about the importance of Segregation at Source and recycling, besides establishing systems to ensure effective practice. We have joined forces with local municipalities to train waste workers and ragpickers in these concepts and to provide an efficient collection system that covers virtually all segments: Households, Offices, Schools, Hospitals and Commercial Establishments. Proper segregation, we believe, drastically reduces the amount of waste going to landfill sites with the dry waste collected providing competitive raw material to several industries like Glass, Paper and Plastic. Our interventions have also resulted in higher earnings for ragpickers and waste workers. Dabur is today implementing a series of waste management projects tailored to local situations, which includes promoting home composting and involving women's Self-Help Groups. 4% Increase in Hazardous Waste Generation in FY 2019-20 as compared to FY 2018-198 MT e-waste disposed to approved e-waste recyclers in FY 2019-20 60% Plastic waste generated by Dabur collected and processed/recycled in FY 2019-20 Under our Plastic Waste Management EPR activity, Dabur has collected over 12,000 tonnes of post-consumer Plastic Waste (both recyclable and non-recyclable) direct from the end-users with the help of around 15,000 local ragpickers, covering 100 Collection Centres and 30 local NGOs/Local Partners.

These 25 States & purposes only.Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements86 87 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 Moving forward on its commitment towards becoming a Plastic Waste Neutral Company, Dabur has launched a unique Plastic Waste Collection drive - My 10 Kg Plastic. Under this initiative, Dabur, along with Indian Pollution Control Association (IPCA), have been running a series of programmes involving Government agencies, community members, residential societies, schools and offices to build awareness about segregation and safe disposal of plastic waste. The plastic waste collected under this initiative is sent to waste collection centres established by IPCA across Delhi-NCR, preventing them from ending up in landfills, rivers and oceans. The programme was rolled out as part of East Delhi Municipal Corporation's (EDMC) six-week-long 'Swacchta Hi Sewa - Plastic Waste Shramdaan Campaign' on the occasion of the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. This initiative draws from the fact that Per Capita plastic waste generation in India today stands at around 10 Kg, which means every individual generates around 10 Kg of plastic waste every year. Through this programme, we have been inviting individuals to collect and send 10 Kg of plastic waste generated in your homes to become Plastic Waste Neutral Citizens. This programme is gradually being extended to other parts of the city and country. Taking this initiative further, we also conducted a Plogging Run with the EDMC in Delhi, which saw enthusiastic participation from community members and Dabur employees. To increase the involvement of Dabur employees and their families in the plastic waste management programme, we have now rolled a unique incentive scheme for employees donating plastic waste under the 'My 10 Kg Plastic' initiative. A special Mobile App and a microsite has been created for employees, where they can log-in and place their request for plastic waste collection at their doorstep. A special waste collection vehicle will reach their homes at a scheduled time to weigh and collect the plastic waste. The depositor is awarded reward points for every Kg of plastic waste submitted. They can accumulate these points and redeem them at the microsite for a variety of gifts and products. water stewardship Water is the most valuable natural resource for life and thriving ecosystems. Reducing water consumption and improving water quality are important elements of environmental stewardship at Dabur. We continuously optimise water consumption through process modification and adoption of new technologies. Water conservation is an integral part of the Environment Management System at Dabur India Ltd, and we have developed a water management strategy that provides guidance on how we drive water efficiencies and reduce water usage at our facilities. We closely monitor water use at our factories, and most of our manufacturing locations have adopted a zero liquid discharge strategy. Dabur strives to recycle usable water from the effluents after treatment in order to reduce freshwater intake. We understand that availability of water is fundamental for operating any plants, and we could face risks due to drought situations or less rainfall in monsoon, or regulated allocation of water. We are committed to implement the 3R principle for conservation of water at all our units. In addition to setting up Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) and Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) at all manufacturing units, we have also deployed rainwater harvesting facilities, which help to recharge groundwater. Other waste management initiatives include recycling boiler blowdown water; ash water recycling; re-use of treated wastewater for Gardening, Road Cleaning, Toilet Flushing Purpose and in Fire Storage Tanks. 1.7% Reduction in fresh Raw Water consumption in FY 2019-20 over FY 2018-19 4.8% OverviewBoard & India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 energy & emission Optimisation Energy consumption is one of the main causes of Greenhouse Gas emissions and, as a result, Climate Change. All our operations factor energy management in their business plans and implement technologies and systems that could improve energy usage. We believe that a significant impact can be made from reducing wastage of energy and increasing energy efficiency. In FY 2019-20, various initiatives were taken by Dabur and our employees to reduce indirect energy consumption through optimisation of operations involving cooling tower fan, cooling water pump, etc. The toilets in all our units are designed for maximum utilisation of natural light and have sensor-triggered automated lighting system. All employees are also motivated to Switch-Off the lights when not in use. This has not only helped us reduce our energy consumption but also resulted in significant waste minimisation at source. Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring, On-Line Stack Monitoring & Thermography Tests are conducted. Dabur maintains Particulate Matter (PM), SOx, NOx and other pollutants well below the prescribed stipulated standards at all our locations. These are also reported to the regulatory authorities. Dabur does not use any Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) in its operations. Growing cost of energy and its linkage with Climate Change is a major business concern at Dabur. To tackle this issue, we have decided to focus on improving process energy efficiency and shifting from Diesel Generators to PNG Generator at our units.

The characteristics of treated effluent are maintained below limits prescribed by respective State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs). Monitoring of water quality parameters is conducted at regular intervals with the Ministry of Environment & Forests-certified or SPCB-recognised environmental laboratories. At all operating plants, 100% domestic water is treated in STP and recycled for plantation development or sprayed to minimise fugitive dust emission. The treated effluent is utilised for dust suppression. Most of the other solid wastes generated are sold to third-party contractors for appropriate disposal. A large percentage of non-hazardous waste disposed in this manner is eventually recycled or reused. Hazardous waste is stored and disposed as per Hazardous Wastes (Management, Handling and Trans-boundary Movement), 2008 & its subsequent amendments. There have been no spills in the reporting year.

Technical goods and services, marketing services and research and development are important components of our indirect procurement portfolio. We also engage with several farmers across India for cultivation of medicinal plants and herbs. Our scientists engage with these farmers and tribal communities, training them on scientific and sustainable cultivation of herbs. This exercise has resulted in an increase in the population of these medicinal herbs, some of which are rare, besides supplementing the household income of these farmers. We have been taking long-term actions to reduce our GHG emissions jointly with our suppliers and business associates. Even to transport our products, we choose partners who are dedicated to sustainability and are socially conscious.

Ayurvedic herbs With a number of wild Ayurvedic and medicinal herbs staring at extinction due to over-exploitation and deforestation, Dabur - as the pioneer in Ayurvedic products - has taken the lead in preserving and growing this herbal wealth. The success of this initiative can be gauged by the fact that the total area under cultivation of rare medicinal herbs has grown to over 6,000 acres and the number of farmers taking up cultivation today stands at 8,500 farmers. Our biodiversity initiatives involve farmers, tribal and forest- based communities across the country, taking them along in this mission to not just arrest the decline in the population of these rare herbs but also increase their numbers. Our Environment Sustainability strategy is aimed at preserving ecosystems, halting the accelerated loss of biodiversity through programmes aimed at protecting rare medicinal herbs from extinction, promoting sustainable cultivation of rare herbs, understanding environmental challenges associated with cultivating herbs. We have identified environmentally-sensitive species of medicinal plants and herbs, and developed methodologies to address their sustainability concerns. We have joined hands with local NGOs across the country and Universities in this mission, jointly undertaking special training programmes for farmers, villagers and tribal communities across the country to train them on sustainable and environment-friendly cultivation processes. We have also established a fully automated state-of-the- art greenhouse in Pantnagar (Uttarakhand), in addition to satellite nurseries and demo cultivation sites across the country. Today, we have over 10 satellite nurseries situated across the length and breadth of the country, from the Himalayan valleys to the coastal region in Tamil Nadu.

The pandemic has thrown economies out of gear, disrupted lives and livelihood like never before. At Dabur, we have pledged support towards India's fight against the COVID-19 pandemic by lending a hand to the Government's efforts to endure the social and economic impacts of the CoronaVirus pandemic as well as protecting vulnerable populations by enabling access to food and essential supplies. With the rapid spread of the outbreak, Dabur realigned its CSR strategy and immediately commenced activities aimed at providing relief to COVID patients, frontline Police, Health and Sanitation workers, migrant workers and community members during these unprecedented times. The Dabur Group also established a 'Dabur Care Fund for COVID-19', to protect lives and livelihood, and support those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We have further earmarked a fund of ` 21 Crore towards Relief efforts in FY 2020-21, helping meet immediate needs of those most affected by this pandemic. Dabur's COVID support initiatives included: supporting the 10,000-bed COVID Centre: With the rapid spread of the COVID pandemic, the Union Government and Delhi Government have together set up a 10,000-bed COVID Centre in the outskirts of the national capital. Dabur has been supporting this centre by providing them necessary medical and logistics support in managing the centre. We are also providing a range of our hygiene products, like Hand Wash and Hand Sanitisers, to various hospitals set up for COVID-19 Mobile COVID-Testing Van: We have rolled a mobile testing van in Noida to support the Uttar Pradesh Government's efforts towards increasing COVID testing in the district. This van has been conducting 200-250 COVID tests every day free of cost Protective Kits for frontline Police Personnel: We are providing Health & Hygiene Kits to Police Personnel across the country as they work towards ensuring the safety of citizens during the lockdown period. These kits include Face Masks, Hand Sanitisers and immunity- booster medicines like Dabur Chyawanprash. In addition, we are working with Police Departments across the country and providing them Ayurvedic immunity boosting medicines to protect the health of these frontline warriors Immunity and nutrition support to Communities and Migrant w orkers: Hunger has emerged as a big challenge due to COVID-19 with a large number of migrant and daily-wage workers struggling each day for essentials to survive. We are working with local NGOs and community leaders in extending support towards provision of nutritious meals and medicines to people in need during this lockdown. As part of this relief package, Dabur has provided over 10,00,000 litres of fruit juices and coconut water to support the nutrition needs of the urban poor and migrant workers. In addition, we have also been supporting communities with dry ration hygiene and safety Kits for Communities: Safety and Personal Hygiene have also emerged as key needs within the community. To meet the growing need for preventive gears like face masks in rural India, Dabur has engaged members of the Tailoring Centres that it operates in the hinterland to stitch face masks, which are being distributed free of cost to villagers and Rural Health Centre workersCorporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements100 101 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 200-250 COVID tests conducted every day, free of cost in Noida10,00,000 Litres of fruit juices, coconut water to meet the nutrition needs of migrant workers swasthya Aur suraksha Discrimination against girls in India has been going on since ages now. Even today, there are several sections of the Indian society where the girl child is treated as a burden. Given this scenario, Dabur has put together an integrated programme aimed at improving the Health, Nutrition and Safety Standards in rural India, with a particular focus on the girl child. The programmes have been specially crafted to give the girl child the right chances to nurture their talent and skills, and helping them excel in different areas of life. The four key pillars of this Integrated Programme are: Safe and Nutritious Food Promoting Kitchen Garden Self-Defence Training Promoting Health Care As part of this programme, we - along with Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) - organise Safe & Nutritious Food (SNF) campaigns in schools to spread awareness about having a balanced diet and staying away from junk food. We understand that children are powerful change agents who can usher in behavioural change and promote consumption of safe and wholesome food in their respective households. With this programme, we reach out to school-going kids and teacher to spread information about nutritious food intake. Under this, we have also trained and appointed Wellness Co-ordinators in schools, who would conduct these awareness sessions on a regular basis, besides organising activities to make students understand the significance of washing hands and maintaining hygiene.Taking this further, we also distribute seeds of fruit plants and vegetable among the students and encourage them to grow these in their home kitchen gardens under our 'Ghar ki Bagiya' project. We have also organised Dental Camps in schools to educate kids about the need for proper Oral Hygiene. We are now taking this forward and incorporating sessions on menstrual hygiene for the girl child. With instances of harassment against girls and women prevalent in our society, we offer Self-Defence training to girls in villages, to promote life skill for self-protection and self-development among the girls. By making them learn self-defence, we can ensure a society brimming with powerful and strong women who can protect themselves. 30 Government schools where awareness sessions on safe nutrition were held886 Students were distributed vegetable seeds in 23 schools 318 Students covered through dental camps34 Self Defence training sessions in 12 schools for 1,333 students water , sanitation & hygiene (w ash) '700 Se 7 Kadam' is one of our flagship development initiatives aimed at protecting the dignity of women in rural India. As part of this programme, we have been giving them access to clean sanitation facilities within their households, in addition to establishing proper sanitation facilities in schools. The household sanitation programme today covers three states: Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh. This programme a saturation level with Dabur constructing nearly 3,882 household toilets in these states, covering all the households in the villages adopted by us. This project has gone a long way in improving the health & sanitation standards in households and has significantly reduced the cases of diseases and malnutrition due to open defecation. With the household toilet construction activity now completed, Dabur is focussing on maintenance of existing household toilets and conducting awareness and training programmes, besides distribution of hygiene kits in households. 57 Villages achieved Open Defecation-Free status Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements100 101 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 Immune India One of our longest running development programmes, Immune India seeks to drive awareness among school-going kids on the need for boosting your body's internal immunity system to remain healthy in today's fast- paced life. Through this programme, we have been reaching out to schools across the country and educating students, teachers and even the parents on how good immunity can help battle the host of diseases and recurring ailments spread by these germs, viruses, and other organisms during the change of season. In FY 2019-20, we organised this campaign in schools and orphanages across India to promote awareness about Immunity and prevention from illnesses. Ayurvedic practitioners were roped in for hosting awareness camps. 3,000+ Underprivileged children reached out to in 14 cities health Camps As part of our commitment to provide Health and Well-Being for all, Dabur organises Health Camps across the country. These multi-disciplinary camps also offer the poor and needy access to good quality health care and subsidised medicines. At these camps, people were offered free diagnosis, Ayurvedic medicines and care. Lady doctors are also present at these camps to reach out to a large number of women in the selected intervention areas. The uniqueness of the model lies in its comprehensive approach where health promotion and prevention are given equal importance while curative care is administered. As a special initiative this year, Dabur organised an Ayurveda Health Camp specially for Bhopal Gas Victims on Sharad Purnima, particularly aimed at treating long-standing respiratory diseases and allergies such as asthma, bronchitis, chronic cough & cold, sinus etc. In this unique all-night Health Camp, which ran throughout the night from 9 pm to 5 am, the medicines are kept exposed to moon rays all through the night and consumed in the early morning with Vedic chanting. Besides offering free health check-ups to around 12,000 people, Dabur also provided Ayurvedic medicines to the poor & needy, free of cost at these camps. Dabur also runs a Wellness Centre in the walled city area of Delhi offering health check-ups and subsidised medicines to public, particularly from the minority community. 1,208 General Health Camps organised in FY 2019-201,52,349 Patients examined at these Health Camps environment sustainability Project Our Environment Sustainability strategy is aimed at preserving ecosystems, halting the accelerated loss of biodiversity through programmes aimed at protecting rare medicinal herbs from extinction, promoting sustainable cultivation of rare herbs, understanding environmental challenges associated with cultivating herbs and supporting farmers to take up herb cultivation and bee-keeping. Under this project, spread across 10 states, we have joined hands with local NGOs and Universities to undertake special training programmes for farmers, villagers and tribal communities across the country to train them on sustainable and environment-friendly cultivation processes. We engage with marginal farmers, providing them visible economic opportunities and supplementing their income. We also supply quality plantation material, grown at our state-of-the-art nursery and greenhouse in Pantnagar, free of cost to these farmers. 4,820 Acres of land under cultivation of medicinal herbs6,947 Farmers engaged in cultivation of medicinal herbs 34 Districts covered under our herb cultivation programme19,32,325 Saplings of herbs distributed free of cost to farmers in FY 2019-20 1,800 Farmers involved in Bee-Keeping139 MT of Honey produced by farmers in FY 2019-20Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements102 103 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 We also help local farmers in Bihar take up Bee-Keeping as an additional income generation activity. This activity is undertaken in 10 districts of Bihar, and we have supported the farmers by distributing 18,000 bee boxes to them. water Conservation in Rajasthan Recognising the growing importance of community-level programmes for Water Conservation and Management, Dabur has been running a water conservation programme in Rajasthan, covering two areas: Alwar and Newai. The programme has been developed with active community participation to improve the sustainable livelihood of the poorest and excluded communities in the area by strengthening their access to water and technology as well as management capacities. Called Desert Bloom, this project uses cost-effective, eco-friendly community-based technologies like water harvesting, water conservation, recharging of tube wells and plantation to give rural communities in Rajasthan get access to water all through the year for their personal consumption and irrigation needs. 1,200 Families directly benefited from the Water Conservation project10 Feet rise in Water Table in Newai Promotion of education At Dabur, we believe that Education is both the means to a better life and a key to ensure overall development of the society. Our Education programmes form a key pillar of our development agenda. On the one hand, we have been sensitising people living in urban and semi-urban slums on the need for education and encouraging them to enrol their children to formal schools. Our non-formal education centres, called Gyan Deep Kendras, providing basic education to out-of-school underprivileged kids between 202 Kids received basic education at 5 Non-Formal Education Centres337 Kids given special learning classes at 13 Remedial Education Centres 14,482 Kids in 55 schools in 6 states benefited by School Support programme1,533 Sets of desk-benches distributed 30 Schools revamped with BaLA paintings6 and 14 years of age. On completing the basic education course at our centres, these kids are linked to formal schools. We also operate Remedial Education Centres, called Gyan Arjan Kendras, to support weaker students by offering them special tuition classes. On the other hand, we work towards improving the infrastructure in schools to uplift their learning experience. Under this programme, called Adarsh Paathshala, we provide basic infrastructure to these schools by way of solid wood desks and benches for students and teachers, development of kitchen area and drinking water facilities, providing almirahs and dustbins etc. Building as Learning Aid (BaLA) paintings are also undertaken in schools. We are also constructing separate toilet blocks for girls and boys in select schools as part of our sanitation programme. Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements102 103 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 women empowerment At Dabur, we believe that Skill Development is a powerful agent of social transformation. Providing vocational training to women and girls in rural India not only helps bridge the gap between skilled and unskilled labour but also helps the rural youth with better employment and self-employment opportunities. Dabur runs vocational training programmes, devised after detailed discussions with the community members and keeping in mind their specific needs and sensitivities, for developing soft skills that can help girls in these villages set up small businesses and become local entrepreneurs. At our Skill Development Centres in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Assam and Rajasthan, we provide rural girls training on various crafts like Cutting- Tailoring, Beauty Care, Handicraft etc. This year, we announced the launch of 'Fem Beauty Academy' in rural Uttar Pradesh to offer advanced beauty training. Dabur joined hands with renowned beautician Ms Veena Desai and conducted an Advanced Beauty Training programme for our trainers in Uttar Pradesh. Eight Trainers underwent the week-long programme and were awarded certificates, jointly endorsed by Ms Desai's salon 'Beauty Affairs' and Fem. These master trainers would now further train women in rural UP . We have also joined hands with NIIT Foundation to offer Computer Education and Training to rural boys and girls in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh. This has today emerged as a much sought-after course in the hinterland. As part of our Women Empowerment and Financial Inclusion interventions, Dabur is also helping women form Self-Help Group (SHGs) and Joint Liability Groups (JLGs), and raise funds for running small businesses. The success of this initiative can be gauged by the fact that there's hardly been any default in repayment of bank loans. This initiative has gone a long way in raising the self-esteem of women in the hinterland. 1,011 Rural girls and women offered skill training in FY 2019-2046 Students trained at our Computer Literacy Centres 125 Self-Help Groups functional today, benefiting 1,545 families Care for Ragpickers Ragpickers play a vital role in cleaning the cities and are usually prone to various skin diseases. As part of our overall waste management programme, we have been working towards offering Health Care support to this community. Through a dedicated Health Post established within their community in the outskirts of Delhi, we offer consultancy through an Ayurvedic and Allopathic practitioner besides medicines to meet their health care needs. A series of awareness programmes are also run for ragpickers to educate them about safe collection of consumer waste and improve their standard of living. We have provided safety gloves and face masks to the waste collectors to safeguard their health, besides addressing their nutrition concerns by providing them a variety of nutritious food products. We are also operating a non-formal education centre for the children of ragpickers in the area, offering them basic education and connecting them to mainstream schools. Promotion of sports A special initiative rolled out in Tezpur (Assam) followed a detailed need assessment survey done in the region, this initiative is aimed at identifying sporting talent, particularly in the field of football, from the grassroot and give them an opportunity to enter the mainstream world of sports. We run a Football Training Camp in Tezpur, offering boys and girls, training in football, a sport of choice in the region. A national level trainer has been hired to conduct the programme. Some of our trainees at the camp have been selected by Ansula United Football Club to be part of the team to play at the Indo Nepal Championship Football Tournament in Nepal. Our trainees were also selected in the under-18 trial organised by Rajasthan FC and Palamos CF, while two other kids were selected to represent the district football team. 86 Kids (56 boys and 30 girls) offered Football TrainingCorporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements104 105 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 Intellectual Capital Accumulating and Leveraging the Wealth of Knowledge and Expertise to enhance our Corporate Value.

Stimulating local innovation across markets is an important part of economic inclusion, job creation and social development. Our nearly 100-member strong Research department is involved in every step of the product value chain - from bush to brand. We grow rare medicinal herbs to ensure that only authentic herbs form the ingredients of our various products. Detailed scientific tests are conducted on ingredients to ensure that each product meets the highest standard of quality. Over the past few years, Ayurveda has gained currency with the new-age consumers seeking traditional remedies for their Health and Personal Care needs. The demand for Ayurvedic Healthcare products, particularly in Preventive Healthcare and Immunity Building witnessed a surge in the wake of the COVID pandemic. To meet the growing consumer need for such medicines, Dabur introduced a slew of products in formats as varied as powders to capsules. While many companies have joined the Immunity bandwagon, Dabur, with its 136-year-old heritage, traditional herbal positioning, and strong R&D, was able to quickly roll-out a range of immunity boosters that matched the consumer expectations. science-Based Ayurveda For the past over a century, Dabur has been known as the Science-based Ayurveda Company. We have been marrying the traditional knowledge of Ayurveda with modern-day Science to create products that are highly efficacious and meet the changing needs of consumers, across generations. We have been applying the techniques and methods of modern science to test and validate results, assure quality and explain benefits of various Ayurvedic ingredients as well as Ayurvedic medicines and products in our portfolio. In the wake of the COVID outbreak, we have begun clinical trials to validate the benefit of Dabur Chyawanprash to assess its benefits in building immunity against the novel CoronaVirus. The open-label, randomised trial, which is being conducted at five sites across India, will see whether Chyawanprash can prevent the fatal respiratory disease or reduce the severity of it. This study would generate data to back the efficacy and effectiveness of this Ayurvedic remedy on preventing COVID-19 and also its effect on recovery from COVID and reducing the severity of COVID infection on individuals who become positive during the course of study. We are also conducting studies for Prophylaxis and management of COVID-19, along with various State Governments and the Ministry of AYUSH. As part of this initiative, we have already supplied 7.5 lakh tablets of Guduchi Ghanvati (Giloy tablets) and around 3,000 kg of Dabur Chyawanprash, which are being used to evaluate the immunity-boosting properties of Ayurvedic interventions in preventing and managing COVID-19. We have further committed to supply 6 lakh tablets of Ashwagandha and around 5,000 kg of Chyawanprash for similar studies. We have also committed to support the Ayur Raksha programme recently announced by the Ministry of AYUSH, under which 80,000 Police personnel will be provided AYUSH immunity boosting interventions. These initiatives, we feel, will go a long way in making Ayurveda mainstream. Intellectual Property Our success is a derivative of approach towards managing intellectual capital by acquiring patents and building a strong patent portfolio. Over the years, Dabur has secured several Product Process patents, including bio-medical patents for Ayurvedic formulations. These have further established Dabur's Ayurvedic credentials and leadership in the marketplace. 1 Patent application filed in FY 2019-2043 Patent applications filed by Dabur till date 8 Patents granted till date8 Research Observations published & accepted for publishing in Peer Review Journals in FY 2019-20 Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements106 107 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 Board & Management Reports and Financial statementsCorporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements108 109 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 Management Discussion & Analysis Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements108 109 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 Management Discussion & Analysis Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements110 111 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 EconoMIc ScEnARIo Global Economy The unprecedented onset of Covid-19 pandemic has heavily impacted the global economy. The pandemic is raging high across the world with rising human casualties. Protecting lives and allowing health care systems to cope have required isolation, lockdowns, and widespread closures to slow the spread of the virus. The health crisis is therefore having a severe impact on economic activity. As a result of the pandemic, the global economy is projected to contract sharply by 4.9% in 2020, much worse than during the 2008-09 financial crisis (Fig 1.1).

Source: Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI)Fig 1.2 - GDP Growth of India in 2019 been slowing down during this period primarily due to declining rural wages, high unemployment levels, liquidity crunch in the system and slowdown in demand. First few cases of Covid-19 infection emerged in India in February 2020. Travel restrictions and testing norms were put in place from 1st week of March and these intensified further in the following week leading to a complete lockdown of entire country on 24th March 2020. This led to severe supply bottlenecks as transportation system came to a halt. Large sections of migrant labour moved back to their villages and movement of goods came to a standstill. Demand also came under pressure as consumers stocked up essential goods but cut down on purchases of non-essential products. Most companies shut down their operations in the first 21 days of the lockdown. By May 2020, the restrictions on movement of goods were eased and supply chains became operational, particularly outside the containment zones. While companies have started operations of their manufacturing facilities, a large part of the economy especially the hospitality sector, malls and recreation places, travel and tourism, small and medium industry, continue to be impacted even though there has been easing of lockdown in these sectors as well. Dabur also announced a production shutdown across all its manufacturing units during first phase of the lockdown. Production resumed at some of our manufacturing units, after securing permissions for producing essential products and immunity-boosting Ayurvedic medicines that were gaining demand in view of COVID-19. We deployed innovative strategies and developed new solutions to ensure uninterrupted supplies to retail shelves, which included joining hands with Online Delivery Service providers like Swiggy, Dunzo and Zomato, and leveraging technology to drive sales and service orders. Details of the initiatives undertaken by Dabur have been presented in the Integrated Report section of this Annual Report. outL ook The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have a major negative impact across the world. It has led to quarantines, regional lockdowns and social distancing\u2014which are essential to contain the virus \u2014with particularly acute effects on sectors that rely on social interactions such as travel, hospitality, entertainment, and tourism.

During FY2019-20, the sector witnessed growth of 7.2% as per AC Nielsen, which is almost half of the 14% growth reported in FY2018-19. The FMCG sector saw a sharp slowdown during the year on account of moderation in economic activity, low farm incomes and weak rural wage growth, liquidity crunch in the system, high unemployment levels and downtrading across categories. By March 2020, the sectoral growth dropped to 3.3% in value terms and 0.5% in volume terms. The Corona virus pandemic has further impacted the sector since March 2020 due to restrictions on movement of goods, supply side bottlenecks and impact on consumption. Consumers have been stocking up essential products such as packaged foods, staples, tea, coffee, milk, detergents, and other products of daily usage. During this phase, demand has also surged for health and hygiene products as these aspects came into sharp focus. There was a surge in demand for hygiene products like sanitizers and disinfectants in addition to immunity building OTC and healthcare products. However, discretionary and nonessential items have seen weak demand as the focus during the lockdown has been on food and hygiene. outlook Currently the path to recovery is still uncertain as the curve of infection has not yet flattened and there are more than 3,500 containment zones across the country.

We expect the following consumer trends to pick up in the post-COVID world: 1. Increased consumer focus on healthcare, particularly preventive healthcare, with a preference for Ayurveda- based solutions that boost immunity 2. Greater focus on Personal Hygiene with demand for hand and home sanitisers expected to grow exponentially 3. Discretionary spending would be curtailed due to shift of priorities towards essentials 4. Movement towards financial security to gain momentum 5. Technology to act as a catalyst for convenient, safe and enhanced consumer experiences We also expect the industry to undergo recalibration of the supply chain and distribution network, with channels like e-commerce and Direct to Consumer gaining salience. Local kirana (grocery) stores have seen a resurgence as proximity and availability of products came into prominence. These retail outlets may become more organized, digitally enabled, and serviced directly. Recently, India's Top 12 consumer goods companies, including Dabur India Ltd, have partnered with the government to convert millions of neighbourhood kirana stores into sanitised and safe retail outlets selling daily essentials. These kiranas will be called Suraksha Stores and linked to the government's Aarogya Setu app. The companies, in addition to registering these outlets as Suraksha Stores, will help the kirana staff implement safety norms such as social distancing and sanitisation, and supply them sanitisers, masks and gloves. The government is targeting to bring 1 million stores under this category in the first phase. This is the one of the several steps that FMCG companies are taking to push demand and ensure that retail shelves remain stocked in the eventuality of the lockdown and its impact on trade channels persisting. According to Nielsen, the effects of the disruptions caused by COVID-19 would linger on for the rest of the year, prompting the market researcher to slash its 2020 growth outlook for India's FMCG sector to 5-6% from its earlier projection of 9-10%. It further stated said that the long-term effects of the pandemic will have widespread impact in the months to come. However, FMCG sector is one of those which will be less impacted than others as demand for consumer staples is expected to revive as situation begins to normalize. Health care Industry In view of Covid-19 pandemic, the need to build immunity and fight illnesses has gained prominence, not just in consumer mind space but also among the medical fraternity. The demand for Ayurvedic products has been on the rise for a few years now. As per a report by IMARC, released prior to the COVID pandemic spread, Indian Ayurvedic products market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 14% during 2019-2024. A key factor driving the Indian ayurvedic products market is increasing popularity of natural and herbal medicines and their benefits among the consumers. Factors such as rising health concerns and awareness about the side-effects of western medicines is further driving the consumer preference for Ayurvedic products in the country. Furthermore, the distribution network of ayurvedic products have improved significantly, increasing the accessibility of these products across both urban and rural regions. The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a sharper resurgence in consumer interest, awareness and demand for Ayurvedic therapies and medicines. Within a month of the outbreak, 'Immunity' became one of the most searched words on Google, reflecting the shift in consumer preference. The word 'Immunity' saw a 500% increase while 'Vitamin C' searches went up by over 150% in 2020. There is today a significant interest towards immunity building, health and hygiene products and the adoption rates are improving as well. The government through the Ministry of AYUSH has been encouraging citizens of India to use Ayurvedic products and practice Yoga to build immunity. As per an advisory issued on 31st March 2020, the AYUSH Ministry had, among other measures, recommended the following to boost immunity to fight illnesses: Take Chyawanprash 10gm (1tsp) in the morning. Diabetics were advised to take sugar free Chyawanprash. Drink herbal tea / decoction (Kadha) made from Tulsi (Basil), Dalchini (Cinnamon), Kalimirch (Black pepper), Shunthi (Dry Ginger) and Munakka (Raisin) - once or twice a day. Add jaggery (natural sugar) and / or fresh lemon juice to your taste, if needed. Golden Milk- Half tea-spoon Haldi (turmeric) powder in 150 ml hot milk - once or twice a day.

Ever since the COVID outbreak, the consumer need for hygiene products - ranging from hand sanitisers to household disinfectants - has gone up significantly. According to Nielsen India, demand for such products jumped by nearly three-fold. To cater to this growing need, companies across sectors diversified into manufacturing hygiene products for sanitizing hands and personal spaces within homes. Dabur also advanced the launch of its hand sanitizer by nearly a quarter to mid-March, in order to meet the emerging need gap. We have since expanded this portfolio with the introduction of air sanitisers, all-purpose disinfectants and sanitizing floor cleaners. This increasing awareness on personal hygiene, coupled with the rise in adoption of digital media, social media and e-commerce, consumption of home and personal care products is likely to sustain. Going forward, in the Covid-19 world, we might see consumers spending more on essential personal care products and lesser on discretionary personal care products. Consumers are likely to increase focus on value for money with premium category likely to see a moderation. However, some of these trends may be temporary in nature and a rebound is likely to happen post Covid. Foods Industry The Food sector, which contributes to 57% of the overall FMCG market, comprises broad categories like packaged Atta, rice, edible oil, dairy products, beverages, baby food etc. During the year, this category witnessed growth of 8-9%. While the Food sector, riding on demand for consumer staples, has been growing at a good pace, the Juices & Nectars segment saw some pressure over the past year on account of downtrading by the consumers to lower priced alternatives such as milk-based and carbonated beverages/drinks. That said, the Juices & Nectars market is still heavily underpenetrated and has a huge headroom for growth by capitalizing on innovations both in formats and extensions. Due to the extended lockdown in India, cooking at home was a big theme due to which convenience foods and cooking ingredients were in high demand. Dabur's Culinary portfolio under the Hommade brand tapped the 'Chef within households' during the lockdown with a range of easy-to-prepare online recipes. These trends may get strengthened going forward as Covid effect is expected to last for a while. coMPAny o vERvIEw Dabur India Ltd is the largest Ayurvedic and natural health care company in the country with a portfolio of over 400 products.

Sales & Distribution - India Despite the economic headwinds and liquidity crunch in the marketplace, Dabur has been aggressively investing ahead of the curve to ramp up its distribution infrastructure, covering both urban and rural India. The year saw Dabur move ahead full steam on its plans to expand its rural footprint by enhancing its village network and creating special products to ride this network expansion. On the other hand, significant investments were made to drive up its direct reach in retail outlets, besides enhancing coverage of Chemist outlets. This distribution enhancement exercise helped Dabur during the COVID-imposed lockdown. As part of this strategy, we have increased our village network to cover 52,298 villages, up from 44,068 villages in March 2019. This helped us drive our rural business strongly and mitigate the impact of the economic slowdown through most part of the year. This expansion also held good during the COVID-imposed lockdown as demand continued to pour in from rural India, making up for some of the losses from urban markets, where the lockdown was more severe. We have increased our direct reach to 1.2 million outlets by the end of the 2019-20 financial year, adding 113,989 new outlets during the year. In the urban markets, Dabur has been working towards driving growth with a special focus on emerging channels like e-commerce, Modern Trade and Cash & Carry, as these channels have shown signs of resilience during the slowdown. Modern Trade and e-commerce had been growing at a faster pace with urban and millennial consumers gravitating towards more premium offerings. To cater to this demand, we created special products for the e-commerce marketplace, which are more premium in nature. The first of the new e-commerce specific range was our Dabur Amla Kids Hair Care range. We have also been investing in higher consumer activations and promotion in Modern Trade outlets to drive demand. The lockdown imposed post Covid brought the entire Sales system to a grinding halt in the initial days with movement restricted and consumers shying away from stepping outside their homes. The traditional Kirana stores became the preferred go-to point for consumers for their daily grocery needs during the lockdown. As they remained open during the lockdown period, these neighborhood Kirana stores gained prominence in the minds of consumers and emerged as the preferred contact point for consumers to fulfil their needs for daily essentials. Dabur also deepened its engagement with these outlets in several ways. Dabur has joined forces with 11 other like-minded FMCG companies in India to support the Government in providing Indians a safe shopping experience in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak. Under this joint initiative, called Suraksha Stores, we are working towards converting the neighborhood Kirana stores into sanitised retail outlets selling daily essentials, while adhering to safety norms such as social distancing and sanitisation. This would go a long way in controlling the spread of COVID-19 in India. The retail outlets have been mapped and linked to the Government's newly created mobile application, Aarogya Setu. Under this program, we have reached out to retail Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements128 129 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 stores across India, enrolled them under the program and provided online training on safe hygiene practices. In the second phase, we are supporting these outlets by providing them sanitsation kits which would be put outside the stores to be used by consumers. The staff at these stores are also being provided face masks, gloves and hand sanitisers for personal protection. In addition, these outlets are being trained to ensure that they maintain social distancing within and outside their outlets and display posters related to safe practices. This initiative is also being extended to cover the entire Supply Chain. Called Suraksha Circle, this would involve educating the Supply Chain partners and enabling them with the right tools to create a safe environment for all. The initial days of the lockdown saw the distribution supply chain come to a grinding halt with most stockists and distributor downing shutters. We worked closely with the stockist partners to help them restart their businesses and even started supplying products to their homes. We also established direct connect with retail partners to ensure that they do not run out of stock and uninterrupted supplies are maintained. During these unprecedented times, Dabur developed innovative solutions and leveraged technology to ensure uninterrupted supply of our essential products to retailers. In some cases where stockists were unable to operate, we commenced direct supplies to retail outlets. We also created a special Mobile App for Retailers, through which they can place orders for Dabur products. These orders are then serviced either directly through our salesforce or through nearby stockists. Around 40,000 retail outlets were enrolled on the App. other unique interventions include initiating retailer order-booking through WhatsApp wherein a dedicated WhatsApp number was shared with retailers on which orders can be sent as a text message. Further, we activated our Call Centre to receive orders directly from retailers, besides booking orders through tele-calling. With the parlor channel being closed in view of the lockdown and social distancing guidelines issued by the government, we realigned our entire Parlor sales force to the service the General Trade and neighbourhood Kirana stores. With stockists unable to send vehicles due to the lockdown, we deployed third party delivery vehicles to send supplies. In some cases, our Salesforce even carried supplies in their personal vehicles to retail outlets and stockiest points. As the lockdown intensified and disrupted the traditional Supply Chain network, we forged new linkages with food aggregators, online delivery service providers, hyperlocal apps and even newspaper vendors to ensure timely supplies of our products to retail shelves. We tied up with logistics firms Delhivery and Javis, besides engaging with Online Delivery Service Providers like Dunzo, and food aggregators like Swiggy and Zomato to deliver products to retail outlets and consumers. With newspaper services also disrupted, we engaged the newspaper hawkers across several cities to ensure timely delivery of products to Retail outlets early in the morning in order to meet the new curfew timings in these cities. With the consumer need and enquiries for immunity- boosting products and Ayurvedic medicines growing in the wake of the COVID outbreak, Dabur worked with retail outlets and Modern Trade stores to create special Immunity corners within these shops. Under our 'Immunity in Shop' program, we enhanced in-shop display and promotion of the Dabur Immunity Booster range. Special branded Immunity Vans were also deployed to showcase the range and generate sales. The Dabur Immunity booster products range was also placed in Dairy & Kirana Stores. With the extended lockdown forcing many consumers to be home-bound, we also commenced a direct outreach program to reach consumer households with our range of Immunity booster products, hygiene products and daily essentials like fruit juices etc. Under this 'Immunity at your Doorsteps' program, our sales officials reached out to Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) across the country and set up small sales counters in their locality or within housing societies, while strictly following the norms of social distancing and personal protection, to give households access to our range of immunity boosters like Dabur Chyawanprash, Giloy tablets, Giloy Churna and Immunity Kit. Similar initiatives were undertaken at community parks and petrol stations to directly reach out to consumers. In some cases where consumers reached out to us on Social Media expressing their inability to move out of their houses during the lockdown to buy Ayurvedic medicines, our frontline salesforce went the extra mile and got the products delivered at their doorsteps. Dabur also worked with B2C e-commerce chains by leveraging the 'essentials' portfolio. Special banners were created for digital media to spread awareness about the essential products in Dabur basket, including the range of immunity building products and hygiene products.we also created a special Mobile App for Retailers, through which they can place orders for Dabur products. these orders are then serviced either directly through our salesforce or through nearby stockists. Around 40,000 retail outlets were enrolled on the App.Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements130 131 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 The E-commerce channel, which has been scaling up well for the Company, now contributed 2.4% to Sales as compared to 1.4% a year ago. This channel has been experiencing the fastest growth through most part of the year. While the channel faced some difficulties during the initial days of the lockdown, it bounced back soon and became the first channel for rolling out new products. Brands covering all categories like Health Supplements, Packaged Juices, Hair Oils, Oral care and Home Care, saw good traction on e-commerce platforms. Another first this year was the introduction of an e-commerce exclusive product range with the launch of Dabur Amla Kids Hair Care range.

Digital Marketing & Media Strategy With a growing number of consumers, particularly millennials and centennials, spending longer periods of time on their mobile screens and laptops, the media landscape in India is undergoing a major shift. There are also a growing number of consumers who now prefer to shop online for FMCG products. According to recent research by Kantar IMRB, India's Internet users have reached about 627 million. Of this, 293 million active users reside in urban India and 200 million active users in rural India. The rural internet users are growing at a rate of 35% annually as against an urban user growth of 7%. At Dabur, we have strengthened our Digital Marketing initiatives and have put in place annual partnerships and sponsorships with digital platforms to improve our brand presence. Special tie-ups are also being put in place with digital platforms and e-commerce chains to create virtual shelf display of Dabur products. This initiative, in fact, gained momentum during the COVID lockdown period, helping us better reach out to the specific target audience and improve top-of-mind awareness and recall by positioning your products contextually. Special Immunity and Hygiene counters were created on online platforms. Our spends on digital and e-commerce have grown exponentially in the past year with brands creating special digital-only content. With videos emerging as one of the most consumed forms of content, we have been investing behind creating differentiated and disruptive campaigns across brands.

These special digital creatives helped us drive conversation among our consumers, build strong communities and develop a loyal consumer base. We also effectively used Moment Marketing to drive relevance and conversation around our brands. Memes and special posts were developed around current new developments and public events to build a greater connect with the digitally savvy consumers. With News emerging as the most watched segment across media in the wake of the COVID outbreak, Dabur increased its brand presence on digital News channels and websites with specially created Banner ads and Contextual ads around specific brands like Dabur Chyawanprash, Dabur ImuDab, Dabur Giloy tablets, Real juices and Dabur Red Paste. Digital media was also used to support brands like Dabur ImuDab immunity building syrup and Giloy ki Ghanvati tablets that are not heavily advertised on mainstream media. This strategy has helped improve visibility for these brands, particularly during the lockdown. Influencer marketing is another key pillar of our digital strategy. Dabur has been effectively using influencers and celebrities to tap into their huge follower base and increase consumer awareness about our products. Dabur Honey rolled out a #StayFitFromHome campaign on social media, which saw its brand ambassador Jacqueline Fernandes posting about her fitness regime. Other brands in the Dabur portfolio like Vatika enriched Coconut Oil, OxyLife Bleach, Fem Bleach, Real Activ 100% Juice and Dabur Hommade too increased engagement with consumers on Social Media through Contests and Celebrity-led content on Instagram and YouTube. Dabur Amla Hair Oil created a series of digital campaigns, especially during the lockdown period to build greater connect with consumer.

This was further exacerbated by the lockdown imposed by the government in the second half of March 2020 to curtail the spread of Covid-19. At this point of time, we see the FY 2020-21 revenue and profitability being impacted on account of weak first quarter due to the continued lockdowns in the first two months of the current fiscal.

(Mohit Malhotra) (Dr. Ajay Dua) Chairman & Management ReportsFinancial StatementsPB 193 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 Opinion 1. We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Dabur India Limited ('the Company'), which comprise the Balance Sheet as at 31 March, 2020, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Cash Flow Statement and the Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and a summary of the significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. 2. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 ('Act') in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India including Indian Accounting Standards ('Ind AS') specified under Section 133 of the Act, of the state of affairs of the Company as at 31 March, 2020, and its profit (including other comprehensive income), its cash flows and the changes in equity for the year ended on that date. Basis for Opinion 3. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ('ICAI') together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Key Audit Matters 4. Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 5. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.Independent Auditor's Report To the Members of Dabur India Limited Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter A. Revenue recognition Refer note 32 to the standalone financial statements. Revenue of the Company consists primarily of sale of products and is recognized when control of products being sold is transferred to customer and there is no unfulfilled obligation. Revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable and is accounted for net of rebates, trade discounts. The estimation of discounts, incentives and rebates recognized, related to sales made during the year, is material and considered to be complex and subject to judgments. The complexity mainly relates to various discounts, incentives and scheme offers, diverse range of market presence and complex contractual agreements/commercial terms across those markets. Therefore, there is a risk of revenue being misstated as a result of inaccurate estimates of discounts and rebates. Our key procedures included, but not limited to, the following: a) Assessed the appropriateness of the Company's revenue recognition accounting policies, including those relating to rebates and trade discounts by comparing with the applicable accounting standards; b) Tested the design and operating effectiveness of the general IT control environment and the manual controls for recognition of revenue, calculation of discounts and rebates; c) Performed test of details: i. Tested, on a sample basis, sales transactions to the underlying supporting documentation which includes goods dispatch notes and shipping documents; ii. Reviewed, on a sample basis, sales agreements and the underlying contractual terms related to delivery of goods and rebates to assess the Company's revenue recognition policies with reference to the requirements of the applicable accounting standards; iii. Assessed the Company's process for recording of the accruals for discounts and rebates as at the year-end for the prevailing incentive schemes; Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements194 195 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter The Company also focuses on revenue as a key performance measure, which could create an incentive for overstating revenue by influencing the computation of rebates and discounts. Considering the materiality of amounts involved, significant judgements related to estimation of rebates and discounts, the same has been considered as a key audit matter.iv. Tested, on a sample basis, discounts and rebates recorded during the year to the relevant approvals and supporting documentation which includes assessing the terms and conditions defined in the prevalent schemes and customer contracts; v. Obtained supporting documentation for a sample of credit notes issued after the year end to determine whether the transaction was recognized in the correct accounting period; and vi. Assessed if there is any modification to, or other impact on the contracts with customers due to COVID 19 outbreak. d) Compared the discount, incentives and rebates of the current year with the prior year for variance/trend analysis and where relevant, conducted further inquiries and testing to corroborate the variances by considering both internal and external benchmarks, overlaying our understanding of industry practices and recent changes in economic environment . e) Assessed the appropriateness of the Company's description of the accounting policy, disclosures related to discounts, incentives and rebates and whether these are adequately presented in the standalone financial statements. B. Litigations and claims - provisions and contingent liabilities Refer note 45A and 48 to the standalone financial statements. The Company is involved in direct, indirect tax and other litigations ('litigations') that are pending with different statutory authorities. The level of management judgement associated with determining the need for, and the quantum of, provisions for any liabilities arising from these litigations is considered to be high. This judgement is dependent on a number of significant assumptions and assessments which involves interpreting the various applicable rules, regulations, practices and considering precedents in the various jurisdictions. This matter is considered as a key audit matter, in view of the uncertainty regarding the outcome of these litigations, the significance of the amounts involved and the subjectivity involved in management's judgement as to whether the amount should be recognized as a provision or only disclosed as contingent liability in the standalone financial statements.Our key procedures included, but not limited to, the following: a) Assessed the appropriateness of the Company's accounting policies relating to provisions and contingent liability by comparing with the applicable accounting standards; b) Assessed the Company's process and the underlying controls for identification of the pending litigations and completeness for financial reporting and also for monitoring of significant developments in relation to such pending litigations; c) Assessed the Company's assumptions and estimates in respect of litigations, including the liabilities or provisions recognized or contingent liabilities disclosed in the standalone financial statements. This involved assessing the probability of an unfavorable outcome of a given proceeding and the reliability of estimates of related amounts; d) Performed substantive procedures on the underlying calculations supporting the provisions recorded; e) Assessed the management's conclusions through understanding relevant judicial precedents in similar cases and the applicable rules and regulations; f) Obtained legal opinions from the Company's external legal counsel, where appropriate; g) Engaged subject matter specialists to gain an understanding of the current status of litigations and monitored changes in the disputes, if any, through discussions with the management and by reading external advice received by the Company, where relevant, to validate management's conclusions; and h) Assessed the appropriateness of the Company's description of the accounting policy, disclosures related to litigations and whether these are adequately presented in the standalone financial statements.Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements194 195 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter C. Valuation of investments and impairment thereof Refer note 7 and 13 to the standalone financial statements. The Company's investment portfolio represents a significant portion of the Company's total assets, which primarily consists of: i. Bonds; ii. Non-convertible debentures; and iii. Fixed deposits The aforementioned instruments are valued at amortized cost or fair value through other compressive income (FVTOCI) depending upon the requirements of Ind AS 109, Financial Instruments, as summarized below: 1. Instrument valued at amortized cost: a) Non-convertible debentures; b) Bond; and c) Fixed deposits. 2. Instrument valued at fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVTOCI'): a) Bonds; and b) Non- convertible debentures. This is considered to be a significant area in view of the materiality of amounts involved, judgements involved in determining of impairment/ recoverability of instruments measured at amortized cost which includes assessment of market data/conditions and financial indicators of the investee and judgements in selecting the valuation basis and the complexities involved in the valuation of instruments carried at FVTOCI which includes assessment of the available trading yield of relevant instruments and impact of the COVID 19 outbreak on the assumptions considered for such fair valuations.Our key procedures included, but not limited to, the following: a) Assessed the appropriateness of the relevant accounting policies of the Company, including those relating to recognition and measurement of financial instrument by comparing with the applicable accounting standards; b) For instrument valued at fair value: i. Assessed the availability of quoted prices in liquid markets; ii. Assessed whether the valuation process is appropriately designed and captures relevant valuation inputs; iii. Performed testing of the inputs/assumptions used in the valuation; and iv. Assessed pricing model methodologies and assumptions against industry practice, recent changes in economic environment and valuation guidelines c) For instrument valued at amortized cost: Assessed the instrument for impairment by evaluating if there is any significant increase in credit risk, which mainly involves: i. Evaluating the credit rating of individual instrument, where relevant, to assess if there is any rating downgrade due to recent changes in economic environment; ii. Evaluating the regularity of the interest payment and principal repayment as per agreed plan/term of issuance of instrument, where applicable; and iii. Obtained the valuations of instruments, where required; d) Assessed the appropriateness of the Company's description of the accounting policy and disclosures related to investments and whether these are adequately presented in the standalone financial statements. Information other than the Standalone Financial Statements and Auditor's Report thereon required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of Management and those Charged with Governance for the Standalone Financial Statements 7. The accompanying standalone financial statements have been approved by the Company's Board of Directors. The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance including other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Ind AS specified under Section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and 6. The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Report on Corporate Governance and Director's Report, but does not include the standalone financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements196 197 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 8. In preparing the standalone financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 9. Those Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process. Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements 10. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements. 11. As part of an audit in accordance with Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3) (i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls; Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management; Conclude on the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern; and Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; 12. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 13. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. 14. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements 15. As required by Section 197(16) of the Act, based on our audit, we report that the Company has paid remuneration Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements196 197 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 to its Directors during the year in accordance with the provisions of and limits laid down under Section 197 read with Schedule V to the Act. 16.

In conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements of Dabur India Limited ('the Company') as at and for the year ended 31 March 2020, we have audited the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements of the Company as at that date. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for Internal Financial Controls 2. The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting ('the Guidance Note') issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ('ICAI'). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of the Company's business, including adherence to the Company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act. Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements 3. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing issued by the ICAI prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, and the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements were established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects. 4. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements includes obtaining an understanding of such internal financial controls, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. 5. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to financial statements. Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements 6. A company's internal financial controls with reference to financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial controls with reference to financial statements include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements 7. Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements200 201 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 to financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Opinion 8. In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and such controls were operating effectively as at 31 March, 2020, based on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Ministry of Corporate Affairs (\"MCA\") notifies new accounting standards or amendments to the existing accounting standards. There is no such notification which should have been published from 01 April, 2020. 5. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The financial statements have been prepared using the significant accounting policies and measurement bases summarized below. a. Current / non-current classification: All assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-current as per the Company's normal operating cycle and other criteria set-out in the Act. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and non-current liabilities, as the case may be. b. Revenue recognition: Revenue from sale of products is recognized when control of products being sold is transferred to customer and when there are no longer any unfulfilled obligations. The performance obligations in contracts are considered as fulfilled in accordance with the terms agreed with the respective customers. Revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable and are accounted for net of returns, rebates and trade discount. Sales, as disclosed, are exclusive of goods and services tax. The Company considers the terms of the contract and its customary business practices to determine the transaction price. The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties (for example taxes collected on behalf of government). The consideration promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed consideration, variable consideration (if reversal is less likely in future), or both. The transaction price is allocated by the Company to each performance obligation in an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods to the customer.Summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information for the year ended 31 March, 2020 (All amounts in H crores, unless otherwise stated)Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements208 209 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 For each performance obligation identified, the Company determines at contract inception whether it satisfies the performance obligation over time or satisfies the performance obligation at a point in time. When either party to a contract has performed its obligation, an entity shall present the contract in the balance sheet as a contract asset or a contract liability, depending on the relationship between the entity's performance and the customer's payment. Income from export incentives such as duty drawback, premium on sale of import licenses and lease license fee are recognized on accrual basis when no significant uncertainties as to the amount of consideration that would be derived and as to its ultimate collection exist. Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the lease, except for contingent rental income which is recognized when it arises and where scheduled increase in rent compensates the lessor for expected inflationary costs. Interest income is recognized using effective interest method. Dividend income is recognized at the time when the right to receive is established by the reporting date. Other incomes have been recognized on accrual basis in the financial statements, except when there is uncertainty of collection. c. Property, plant and equipment: Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. These tangible assets are held for use in production, supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes. Cost comprises purchase cost, freight, duties, taxes and other expenses directly incidental to acquisition, bringing the asset to the location and installation including site restoration up to the time when the asset is ready for intended use. Such costs also include borrowing cost if the recognition criteria are met. When a major inspection/repair occurs, its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of the property, plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. Any remaining carrying amount of the cost of previous inspection/repair is derecognized. All other repair and maintenance are recognized in the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss as incurred. Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is provided over the useful lives of assets as specified in Schedule II to the Act except where the Management, has estimated useful life of an asset supported by the technical assessment, external or internal i.e., higher or lower from the indicative useful life given under Schedule II. The Management believes that these estimated useful lives are realistic and reflect fair approximation of the period over which the assets are likely to be used. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: Description Useful lives(upto) Leasehold land Over lease period Building 60 years Plant and machinery 15 years Furniture and fixtures 10 years Vehicles 8 years Office equipment 10 years The residual value and useful life is reviewed annually and any deviation is accounted for as a change in estimate. Components relevant to property, plant and equipment, where significant, are separately depreciated on straight line basis in terms of their life span assessed by technical evaluation in item specific context. For new projects, all direct expenses and direct overheads (excluding services of non-exclusive nature provided by employees in Company's regular payroll) are capitalized till the assets are ready for intended use. During disposal of property, plant and equipment, any profit earned / loss sustained towards excess / shortfall of sale value vis-a-vis carrying cost of assets is accounted for in Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss. d. Capital work-in-progress and intangible assets under development: Capital work-in-progress and intangible assets under development represents expenditure incurred in respect of capital projects / intangible assets under development and are carried at cost. Cost comprises of purchase cost, related acquisition expenses, development / construction costs, borrowing costs and other direct expenditure. e. Investment property: Properties held to earn rentals or / and for capital appreciation or both but not for sale in the ordinary course of business, use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes, Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements210 211 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 are categorized as investment properties. These are measured initially at cost of acquisition, including transaction costs and other direct costs attributable to bringing asset to its working condition for intended use. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss, if any. The cost shall also include borrowing cost if the recognition criteria are met. Said assets are depreciated on straight line basis based on expected life span of assets which is in accordance with Schedule II of the Act. Significant parts of the property are depreciated separately based on their specific useful lives as follows: Description Useful lives(upto) Leasehold land Over lease period Building 60 years Any gain or loss on disposal of investment properties is recognized in Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss. Fair value of investments properties under each category are disclosed under note 6C to the standalone financial statements. Fair values are determined based on the evaluation performed by an accredited external independent valuer applying a recognized and accepted valuation model or estimation based on available sources of information from market. Transfers to or from the investment property is made only when there is a change in use and the same is made at the carrying amount of investment property. f. Intangible assets: Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost of acquisition. The cost comprises of purchase price and directly attributable costs of bringing the assets to its working condition for intended use. Intangible assets arising on acquisition of business are measured at fair value as at date of acquisition. In case of internally generated assets, measured at development cost subject to satisfaction of recognition criteria (identifiability, control and future economic benefit) in accordance with Ind AS 38 'Intangible Assets'. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment loss, if any. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic life. The amortization expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognized in the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss. Amortization of intangible assets such as softwares is computed on a straight-line basis, at the rates representing estimated useful life of up to 5 years. The brands and trademarks acquired as part of business combinations normally have a remaining legal life of not exceeding ten years but is renewable every ten years at little cost and is well established. g. Government subsidy / grants: Government grant is recognized only when there is a reasonable assurance that the entity will comply with the conditions attached to them and the grants will be received. Subsidy related to assets is recognized as deferred income which is recognized in the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss on systematic basis over the useful life of the assets. Purchase of assets and receipts of related grants are separately disclosed in Standalone Statement of Cash Flow. Grants related to income are treated as other operating income in Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss subject to due disclosure about the nature of grant. h. Impairment of non-financial assets At each reporting date, the Company assesses whether there is any indication based on internal / external factors, that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or the cash generating unit (CGU) is estimated. If such recoverable amount of the asset or CGU to which the asset belongs is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount and the reduction is treated as an impairment loss and is recognized in the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss. If, at the reporting date, there is an indication that a previously assessed impairment loss no longer exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed and the asset is reflected at the recoverable amount. Impairment losses previously recognized are accordingly reversed in the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss. An asset is deemed impairable when recoverable value is less than its carrying cost and the difference between the two represents provisioning exigency. i. Impairment of financial assets: In accordance with Ind AS 109 'Financial Instruments', the Company applies expected credit loss ('ECL') model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss for financial assets. ECL is the weighted-average of difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to the Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements210 211 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 Company in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Company expects to receive, discounted at the original effective interest rate, with the respective risks of default occurring as the weights. When estimating the cash flows, the Company is required to consider: All contractual terms of the financial assets (including prepayment and extension) over the expected life of the assets; Cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms. j. Trade receivables: In respect of trade receivables, the Company applies the simplified approach of Ind AS 109 'Financial Instruments', which requires measurement of loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. Lifetime expected credit losses are the expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. k. Other financial assets: In respect of its other financial assets, the Company assesses if the credit risk on those financial assets has increased significantly since initial recognition. If the credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Company measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses, else at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses. When making this assessment, the Company uses the change in the risk of a default occurring over the expected life of the financial asset. To make that assessment, the Company compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial asset as at the balance sheet date with the risk of a default occurring on the financial asset as at the date of initial recognition and considers reasonable and supportable information, that is available without undue cost or effort, that is indicative of significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition. The Company assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the financial asset is determined to have low credit risk at the balance sheet date. l. Financial instruments: Initial recognition and measurement Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument and are measured initially at fair value adjusted for transaction costs, except for those carried at fair value through profit or loss which are measured initially at fair value. Subsequent measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities is described below: Non-derivative financial assets Subsequent measurement Financial assets carried at amortized cost A financial asset is measured at the amortized cost, if both the following conditions are met: a. The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows; and b. Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest ('SPPI') on the principal amount outstanding. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate ('EIR') method. Investments in equity instruments of subsidiaries and joint ventures Investments in equity instruments of subsidiaries and joint ventures are accounted for at cost in accordance with Ind AS 27 'Separate Financial Statements'. Investments in other equity instruments Investments in equity instruments which are held for trading are classified as at fair value through profit or loss ('FVTPL'). For all other equity instruments, the Company makes an irrevocable choice upon initial recognition, on an instrument by instrument basis, to classify the same either as at fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVTOCI') or fair value through profit or loss ('FVTPL'). Amounts presented in other comprehensive income are not subsequently transferred to profit or loss. However, the Company transfers the cumulative gain or loss within equity. Dividends on such investments are recognized in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Debt instruments Debt instruments are initially measured at amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVTOCI') or fair value through profit or loss ('FVTPL') till de-recognition on the basis of: a. the entity's business model for managing the financial assets and b. the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements212 213 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 a. Measured at amortized cost Financial assets that are held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest, are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the EIR method less impairment, if any. The amortization of EIR and loss arising from impairment, if any is recognized in the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss. b. Measured at fair value through other comprehensive income Financial assets that are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both, selling financial assets and collecting contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest, are subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. Fair value movements are recognized in the other comprehensive income ('OCI'). Interest income measured using the EIR method and impairment losses, if any are recognized in the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss. On de-recognition, cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in OCI is reclassified from the equity to 'other income' in the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss. c. Measured at fair value through profit or loss A financial asset not classified as either amortized cost or FVTOCI, is classified as FVTPL. Such financial assets are measured at fair value with all changes in fair value, including interest income and dividend income if any, recognized as 'other income' in the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss. Investments in mutual funds Investments in mutual funds are measured at FVTPL.De-recognition of financial assetsA financial asset is primarily de-recognized when the contractual rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired or the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset. Non-derivative financial liabilities Subsequent measurementSubsequent to initial recognition, all non-derivative financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. De-recognition of financial liabilitiesA financial liability is de-recognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss. Derivative financial instruments The Company holds derivative financial instruments in the form of future contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposure. The counterparty for these contracts are scheduled commercial banks / regulated brokerage firms. Although these derivatives constitute hedges from an economic perspective, they do not qualify for hedge accounting under Ind AS 109 'Financial Instruments' and consequently are categorized as financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. The resulting exchange gain or loss is included in other income / expenses and attributable transaction costs are recognized in the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss when incurred. Financial guarantee contracts Financial guarantee contracts are those contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the specified party fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are recognized as a financial liability at the time the guarantee is issued at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the amount of expected loss allowance determined as per impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 'Financial Instruments' and the amount recognized less cumulative amortization. Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the Standalone Balance Sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. m. Fair value measurement: The Company measures financial instruments, such as, derivatives at fair value at each Standalone Balance Sheet date.Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements212 213 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: In the principal market for the asset or liability; or In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 \u2014 Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 \u2014 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable. Level 3 \u2014 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable. For assets and liabilities that are recognized in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re- assessing categorization (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period. The Company's Management determines the policies and procedures for both recurring fair value measurement, such as derivative instruments and unquoted financial assets measured at fair value, and for non-recurring measurement, such as assets held for distribution in discontinued operations. n. Leases: Where the Company is the lessee Right of use assets and lease liabilities For any new contracts entered into on or after 1 April, 2019, (the transition approach has been explained and disclosed in Note 49) the Company considers whether a contract is, or contains a lease. A lease is defined as 'a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to use an asset (the underlying asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration'. Classification of leases The Company enters into leasing arrangements for various assets. The assessment of the lease is based on several factors, including, but not limited to, transfer of ownership of leased asset at end of lease term, lessee's option to extend/purchase etc. Recognition and initial measurementAt lease commencement date, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet. The right-of-use asset is measured at cost, which is made up of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any initial direct costs incurred by the Company, an estimate of any costs to dismantle and remove the asset at the end of the lease (if any), and any lease payments made in advance of the lease commencement date (net of any incentives received). Subsequent measurementThe Company depreciates the right-of-use assets on a straight-line basis from the lease commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The Company also assesses the right-of-use asset for impairment when such indicators exist. At lease commencement date, the Company measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments unpaid at that date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease if that rate is readily available or the Company's incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability are made up of fixed payments (including in substance fixed payments) and variable payments based on an index or rate. Subsequent to initial measurement, the liability will be reduced for payments made and increased for interest. It is re-measured to reflect any reassessment or modification, or if there are changes in Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements214 215 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 in-substance fixed payments. When the lease liability is re-measured, the corresponding adjustment is reflected in the right-of-use asset. The Company has elected to account for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets using the practical expedients. Instead of recognizing a right-of-use asset and lease liability, the payments in relation to these are recognized as an expense in standalone statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Where the Company is the lessor Leases in which the Company does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are classified as operating leases. Rental income from operating lease is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease, except when the lease rentals, increase are in line with general inflation index. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents are recognized as revenue in the period in which they are earned. Leases are classified as finance leases when substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership transfer from the Company to the lessee. Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as receivables at the Company's net investment in the leases. Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment outstanding in respect of the lease. o. Inventories: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes purchase price, duties, transport, handing costs and other costs directly attributable to the acquisition and bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. The basis of determination of cost is as follows: Raw material, packing material and stock-in-trade valued on moving weighted average basis; Stores and spares valued on weighted average basis; Work-in-progress valued at cost of input valued at moving weighted average basis plus overheads up till the stage of completion; and Finished goods valued at cost of input valued at moving weighted average basis plus appropriate overheads.p. Employee benefits: Liabilities in respect of employee benefits to employees are provided for as follows: Current employee benefitsa. Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non- monetary benefits that are expected to be settled wholly within 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service are recognized in respect of employees' services up to the end of the reporting period and are measured at the amounts expected to be incurred when the liabilities are settled. The liabilities are presented as current employee dues payable in the Standalone Balance Sheet. b. Employees' State Insurance ('ESI') is provided on the basis of actual liability accrued and paid to authorities. c. The Company has adopted a policy on compensated absences which are both accumulating and non-accumulating in nature. The expected cost of accumulating compensated absences is determined by actuarial valuation performed by an independent actuary at each balance sheet date using projected unit credit method on the additional amount expected to be paid / availed as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the balance sheet date. Expense on non-accumulating compensated absences is recognized in the period in which the absences occur. d. Expense in respect of other short-term benefits is recognized on the basis of the amount paid or payable for the period during which services are rendered by the employee. Post separation employee benefit plan a. Defined benefit plan Post separation benefits of Directors are accounted for on the basis of actuarial valuation as per Ind AS 19 'Employee Benefits'. Gratuity liability accounted for on the basis of actuarial valuation as per Ind AS 19 'Employee Benefits'. Liability recognized in the Standalone Balance Sheet in respect of gratuity is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of each reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by an independent actuary using the projected unit credit method. The Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements214 215 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 present value of defined benefit is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows by reference to market yield at the end of each reporting period on government bonds that have terms approximate to the terms of the related obligation. The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefit expense in the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss. The Company contributes its share of contribution to Employees' Provident Fund Scheme administered by a separate trust with its obligation to make good the shortfall, if any, in trust fund arising on account of difference between the return on investments of the trust and the interest rate on provident fund dues notified periodically by the Central Government and any expected loss in investment. Liability recognized in the Standalone Balance Sheet in respect of Dabur India E.P .F. trust is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of each reporting period less the fair value of plan assets on the basis of actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method. Actuarial gain / loss pertaining to gratuity, post separation benefits and PF trust are accounted for as OCI. All remaining components of costs are accounted for in Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss. b. Defined contribution plans Liability for superannuation fund is provided on the basis of the premium paid to insurance company in respect of employees covered under Superannuation Fund Policy. q. Taxation: Tax expense recognized in Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss comprises the sum of deferred tax and current tax except the ones recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Current tax is determined as the tax payable in respect of taxable income for the year and is computed in accordance with relevant tax regulations. Current income tax relating to items recognized outside profit or loss is recognized outside profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or in equity). Minimum Alternate Tax ('MAT') credit entitlement is recognized as an asset only when and to the extent there is convincing evidence that normal income tax will be paid during the specified period. In the year in which MAT credit becomes eligible to be recognized as an asset, the said asset is created by way of a credit to the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss and shown as MAT credit entitlement. This is reviewed at each balance sheet date and the carrying amount of MAT credit entitlement is written down to the extent it is not reasonably certain that normal income tax will be paid during the specified period. Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit under Income-tax Act, 1961. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax relating to items recognized outside Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss is recognized outside Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss (either in other comprehensive income or in equity). r . Provisions, contingent liability and contingent assets: Provisions are recognized only when there is a present obligation, as a result of past events and when a reliable estimate of the amount of obligation can be made at the reporting date. These estimates are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates. Provisions are discounted to their present values, where the time value of money is material. Contingent liability is disclosed for: a. Possible obligations which will be confirmed only by future events not wholly within the control of the Company; or b. Present obligations arising from past events where it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation cannot be made. Contingent assets are neither recognized nor disclosed except when realization of income is virtually certain, related asset is recognised. s. Foreign currency transactions and translations: Foreign currency transactions are recorded in the functional currency, by applying the exchange rate Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements216 217 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 between the functional currency and the foreign currency at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency monetary items outstanding at the balance sheet date are converted to functional currency using the closing rate. Non-monetary items denominated in a foreign currency which are carried at historical cost are reported using the exchange rate at the date of the transactions. Exchange differences arising on monetary items on settlement, or restatement as at reporting date, at rates different from those at which they were initially recorded, are recognized in the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss in the year in which they arise. t. Share based payments - Employee Stock Option Scheme ('ESOP'): The fair value of options granted under Employee Stock Option Plan is recognized as an employee benefits expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options. The total expense is recognized over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each period, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting and service conditions. It recognizes the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. Upon exercise of share options, the proceeds received are allocated to share capital up to the par value of the shares issued with any excess being recorded as share premium. u. Operating segments: Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker ('CODM') of the Company. The CODM is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments of the Company. v. Earnings per share: Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit for the period attributed to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period is adjusted for the effects of all potentially dilutive equity shares.w. Research and development: Expenditure on research is recognized as an expense when it is incurred. Expenditure on development which does not meet the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset is recognized as an expense when it is incurred. Items of property, plant and equipment and acquired intangible assets utilized for research and development are capitalized and depreciated / amortized in accordance with the policies stated for Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets. x. Borrowing cost: Borrowing cost consists of interest and other costs incurred in connection with the borrowing of funds and also include exchange differences to the extent regarded as an adjustment to the same. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition and/or construction of a qualifying asset are capitalized during the period of time that is necessary to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use or sale. A qualifying asset is one that necessarily takes substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use. All other borrowing costs are charged to the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss as incurred. y. Cash and cash equivalents: For the purpose of the Standalone Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cheques in hand, bank balances, demand deposits with banks where the original maturity is three months or less and other short-term highly liquid investments net of outstanding bank overdrafts and cash credit facilities as they are considered an integral part of the Company's cash management. z. Significant Management judgement in applying accounting policies and estimation uncertainty: The preparation of the Company's financial statements requires the Management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Evaluation of indicators for impairment of assets The evaluation of applicability of indicators of impairment of assets requires, the management to make an assessment of several external and internal factors which could result in deterioration of recoverable amount of the assets.Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements216 217 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 Recoverability of advances / receivables At each balance sheet date, based on historical default rates observed over expected life, the management assesses the expected credit losses on outstanding receivables and advances. Defined benefit obligation ('DBO') Management's estimate of the DBO is based on a number of underlying assumptions such as standard rates of inflation, mortality, discount rate and anticipation of future salary increases. Variation in these assumptions may significantly impact the DBO amount and the annual defined benefit expenses. Provisions At each balance sheet date basis the management judgment, changes in facts and legal aspects, the Company assesses the requirement of provisions against the outstanding contingent liabilities. However, the actual future outcome may be different from this judgement. Classification of leases The Company enters into leasing arrangements for various premises. The assessment (including measurement) of the lease is based on several factors, including, but not limited to, transfer of ownership of leased asset at end of lease term, lessee's option to extend/terminate etc. After the Commencement date, the Company reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to extend or to terminate. Contingencies Contingent liabilities may arise from the ordinary course of business in relation to claims against the Company, (refer note 45). By their nature, contingencies will be resolved only when one or more uncertain future events occur or fail to occur. The assessment of the existence, and potential quantum, of contingencies inherently involves the exercise of significant judgments by management and the use of estimates regarding the outcome of future events. Fair value measurements Management applies valuation techniques to determine the fair value of financial instruments (where active market quotes are not available) and share based payments. This involves developing estimates and assumptions consistent with how market participants would price the instrument. The Company engages third party valuers, where required, to perform the valuation. Information about the valuation techniques and inputs used in determining the fair value of various assets, liabilities and share based payments are disclosed in the notes to standalone financial statements. Inventories The Company estimates the net realizable values of inventories, taking into account the most reliable evidence available at each reporting date. The future realization of these inventories may be affected by future demand or other market-driven changes that may reduce future selling prices. Useful lives of depreciable / amortizable assets Management reviews its estimate of the useful lives of depreciable / amortizable assets at each reporting date, based on the expected utility of the assets. Uncertainties in these estimates relate to technical and economic obsolescence that may change the utility of assets. Valuation of investment property Investment property is stated at cost. However, as per Ind AS 40 'Investment Property', there is a requirement to disclose fair value as at the balance sheet date. The Company engages independent valuation specialists to determine the fair value of its investment property as at reporting date. Income taxes The Company's tax jurisdiction is India. Significant judgements are involved in estimating budgeted profits for the purpose of paying advance tax, determining the provision for income taxes, including amount expected to be paid / recovered for uncertain tax positions (refer note 41). The extent to which deferred tax assets/minimum alternate tax credit can be recognized is based on management's assessment of the probability of the future taxable income against which the deferred tax assets/minimum alternate tax credit can be utilized.Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements218 219 Dabur 2019-20Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements218 219 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 6 A PROPERTY , PLANT AND EQUIPMENT The changes in the carrying value of property, plant and equipment for the year ended 31 March, 2019 and 31 March, 2020, are as follows: Description Leasehold landFreehold landLeased Buildings*Buildings Plant and equipmentFurniture and fixturesVehicles Office equipmentTotal Gross block Balance as at April, 31.58 38.89 - 479.75 869.30 69.27 6.942.24 8.0986.50 Transfer from 14.24 0.12 - 0.67 20.02 Disposals / adjustments for the year - - - 0.13 11.08 0.20 1.92 1.78 15.11 Balance as at 929.24 13.59 0.76 - -17.84 Disposals - 2.020.08 13.84 1.544.22 4.45 33.93 2.96 - - 116.48 384.73 37.17 8.27 2.96 102.79 Disposals - - - 0.01 8.890.28 1.05 1.69 11.92 Balance as at 31 March, 2019 3.73 - - 130.95 452.59 41.80 10.14 39.06 678.27 15.00 3.39122.38 Disposals / 0.02 11.01 1.50 1.97 4.10 19.73 Balance 522.75 45.79 10.99 38.35 - 363.27 484.57 32.10 16.76 7.13 365.40 476.65 34.33 15.21 assets (refer note 49) Notes: a) Addition to the above property, plant and equipment includes ` 7.23 crores (31 March, 2019: ` 2.09 crores) incurred at inhouse research and development facilities at Sahibabad, Uttar Pradesh. b) Plant and equipment have been hypothecated with banks against term loans, refer note 22. c) Contractual obligations : Refer note 45 for disclosure of contractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment. d) Leasehold land : Represents land taken on lease for the years ranging from 20 to 99. e) Impairment loss : 'Disposals / adjustments for the year' above include impairment provision mainly pertaining to assets which are lying idle, damaged and having no future use amounting to ` 0.14 crores (31 March, 2019: ` Nil). 6 B CAPITAL WORK-IN-PROGRESS The changes in the carrying value of capital work-in-progress for the year ended 31 March, 2019 and 31 March, 2020 are as follows : Description Amount Gross block Balance as at 1 April, 2018 26.82 Addition for the year 19.92 Transfer to property, plant and equipment 20.02 Transfer to intangible asset 5.03 Balance as at 31 March, 2019 21.69 Addition for the year 102.00 Transfer to property, plant and equipment 17.84 Transfer to intangible asset 0.02 Balance as at 31 March, 2020 105.83Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements218 219 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements 218 219 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 6 C INVESTMENT PROPERTY The changes in the carrying value of investment property for the year ended 31 March, 2019 and 31 March, 2020 are as follows: Description Freehold land Buildings Total Gross block Balance as at 1 April, 2018 5.06 53.57 58.63 Addition for the year - - - Disposals for the year - - - Balance as at 31 March, 2019 5.06 53.57 58.63 Addition for the year - - - Disposals for the year - - - Balance as at 31 March, 2020 5.06 53.57 58.63 Accumulated depreciation Balance as at 1 April, 2018 - 8.27 8.27 Addition for the year - 0.99 0.99 Disposals for the year - - - Balance as at 31 March, 2019 - 9.26 9.26 Addition for the year - 0.99 0.99 Disposals for the year - - - Balance as at 31 March, 2020 - 10.25 10.25 Net block as at 1 April, 2018 5.06 45.30 50.36 Net block as at 31 March, 2019 5.06 44.31 49.37 Net block as at 31 March, 2020 5.06 43.32 48.38 Notes: a) Amount recognized in Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss for investment properties: Particulars For the year ended 31 March, 2020For the year ended 31 March, 2019 Rental income derived from investment properties 9.98 10.39 Less: direct operating expenses that generated rental income 0.43 0.48 Less: direct operating expenses that did not generate rental income - - Profit from leasing of investment properties before depreciation 9.56 9.91 Less: depreciation expense 0.99 0.99 Profit from leasing of investment properties after depreciation 8.57 8.92 b) As at 31 March, 2020, the fair value of investment properties are ` 160.08 crores (31 March, 2019: ` 161.77 crores).

Information on lease transactions pursuant to Ind AS 116 - Leases A Assets taken on lease * The Company has leases for office building, warehouses and related facilities and cars. With the exception of short-term leases and leases of low-value underlying assets, each lease is reflected on the balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. Variable lease payments which do not depend on an index or a rate are excluded from the initial measurement of the lease liability and right of use assets. The Company currently classifies its right-of-use assets in a consistent manner in leased buildings under property, plant and equipment. Each lease generally imposes a restriction that, unless there is a contractual right for the Company to sublease the asset to another party, the right-of-use asset can only be used by the Company. Some leases contain an option to extend the lease for a further term. The Company is prohibited from selling or pledging the underlying leased assets as security.

The adoption of this standard has resulted in recognition of lease liability and right-of-use assets amounting to Rs 45.62 Crores and Rs 46.77 Crores respectivelyas at 1 April, 2019, however it did not have any material impact on the profit of the year ended 31 March, 2020. For contracts in place as at 1 April, 2019, Company has elected to apply the definition of a lease from Ind AS 17 and has not applied Ind AS 116 to arrangements that were previously not identified as lease under Ind AS 17. The Company has elected not to include initial direct costs in the measurement of the right-of-use asset for operating leases in existence at the date of initial application of Ind AS 116, being 1 April, 2019. Instead of performing an impairment review on the right-of-use assets at the date of initial application, the Company has relied on its historic assessment as to whether leases were onerous immediately before the date of initial application of Ind AS 116. On transition, for leases previously accounted for as operating leases with a remaining lease term of less than 12 months and for leases of low-value assets the Company has applied the optional exemptions to not recognise right-of-use assets but to account for the lease expense on a straightline basis over the remaining lease term. For those leases previously classified as finance leases, the right-of-use asset and lease liability are measured at the date of initial application at the same amounts as under Ind AS 17 immediately before the date of initial application. The Company has benefited from the use of hindsight for determining the lease term when considering options to extend and terminate leases. On transition to Ind AS 116 the weighted average incremental borrowing rate applied to lease liabilities recognised was 10 %.Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements242 243 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 The following is a reconciliation of total operating lease commitments at 31 March, 2019 (as disclosed in the financial statements for the year ended 31 March, 2019) to the lease liabilities recognised at 1 April, 2019: Total operating lease commitments disclosed as at 31 March, 2019 2.48 Other adjustments relating to lease commitment disclosures 59.24 Recognition exemptions: Leases of low value assets (1.03) Leases with remaining lease term of less than 12 months (1.45) Operating lease liabilities before discounting 59.24 Discounting impact (using incremental borrowing rate) (14.76) Operating lease liability 44.48 Finance lease obligations under Ind AS 17 1.14 Total lease liabilities recognised under Ind AS 116 at 1 April, 2019 45.62 * Lease rent debited to the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss is 27.88 crores (31 March, 2019 : 38.53 crores) including 25.57 crores ( 31 March, 2019: 22.97 crores).

To manage this, the Company periodically assesses the financial reliability of customers, taking into account the financial condition, current economic trends, and analysis of historical bad debts and ageing of account receivables. Individual risk limits are also set accordingly. The Company considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of asset and whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis throughout each reporting period. To assess whether there is a significant increase in credit risk, the Company compares the risk of default occurring on the asset as at the reporting date with the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition. The Company considers reasonable and supportive forward-looking information. Financial assets are written-off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, such as debtor failing to engage in a repayment plan with the Company. The Company provides for overdue outstanding for more than 90 days other than institutional customers which are evaluated on a case to case basis. The Company's concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables is low, as its customer's base is widely spread across the length and breadth of the country.

Category wise classification of financial instruments The fair values of the financial assets and financial liabilities are defined as the price that would be received on sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values are consistent with those used for the financial year 2018-19. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements254 255 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 i) The fair values of investments in mutual fund units is based on the net asset value ('NAV') as stated by the issuers of these mutual fund units in the published statements as at Balance Sheet date. NAV represents the price at which the issuer will issue further units of mutual fund and the price at which issuers will redeem such units from the investors. ii) The fair values of other investments measured at FVTOCI and FVTPL are determined based on observable market data other than quoted prices in active market. iii) The carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost in these standalone financial statements are a reasonable approximation of their fair values since the Company does not anticipate that the carrying amounts would be significantly different from the values that would eventually be received or settled. Financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value in these financial statement and are grouped into three levels of a fair value hierarchy. The three Levels are defined based on the observability of significant inputs to the measurement, as follows: Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability A The carrying values and fair values of financial instruments by categories as at 31 March, 2020 are as follows: Particulars Carrying valueFair Value* Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 financial assets at fair value through profit and loss ('fVTPL ') Investments in mutual funds 573.73 573.73 - - Total 573.73 573.73 - - Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVTOCI') Investments in debt instruments 892.13 - 892.13 - Investments in equity instruments 0.02 - - 0.02 Total 892.15 - 892.13 0.02 Financial assets at amortised costNon-current(i) Investments Investments in debt instruments 93.34 Investments in subsidiaries and joint venture 98.67 (ii) Loans Security deposits 16.78 (iii) Other financial assets 403.27 Total 612.06 Current(i) Investments Investments in debt instruments / others 808.94 (ii) Loans Security deposits 1.22 (iii) Trade receivables 379.63Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements256 257 Report 2019-20 Particulars Carrying valueFair Value* Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 (iv) Cash and cash equivalents 2.87 (v) Bank balances other than (iv) above 522.73 (vi) Other financial assets 9.25 Sub-Total 1,724.64 Total 2,336.70 Financial liabilities at amortised cost Non-current(i) Borrowings 24.68 (ii) Other financial liabilities 4.66 Total 29.34 Current(i) Borrowings 89.28 (ii) liabilities 137.29 Sub-Total 1,259.02 Total 1,288.36 * During the year, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements.

C Valuation technique used to determine fair value: Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include: (a) Investment in mutual funds: The fair values of investments in mutual fund units is based on the net asset value ('NAV') as stated by the issuers of these mutual fund units in the published statements as at Balance Sheet date. (b) Investment in debt instruments: The fair value of investments that are not traded in an active market is determined using market approach and valuation techniques which maximize the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. 59.

The nationwide lockdown ordered by the Government of India has resulted in significant reduction in economic activities and also the business operations of the Company in terms of sales and production. The Management has considered the possible effects that may result from the pandemic on the recoverability/carrying value of the assets. Based on the current indicators of future economic conditions, the management expects to recover the carrying amount of the assets, however the management will continue to closely monitor any material changes to future economic conditions. Given the uncertainties, the final impact on Company's assets in future may differ from that estimated as at the date of approval of these financial statements. 62. The figures of the previous year have been re-grouped / re-classified to render them comparable with the figures of the current year. 63 In the opinion of the Board of Directors, current assets have a value on realization in the ordinary course of business at least equal to the amount at which they are stated in the balance sheet and provisions for all known / expected liabilities have been made.

Key Audit Matters 4. Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment and based on the consideration of the reports of the other auditors on separate financial statements and on the other financial information of the subsidiaries, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 5. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements266 267 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter A. Revenue recognition Refer note 34 to the consolidated financial statements.Revenue of the Group consists primarily of sale of products and is recognized when control of products being sold is transferred to customer and there is no unfulfilled obligation. Revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable and is accounted for net of rebates, trade discounts. The estimation of discounts, incentives and rebates recognized, related to sales made during the year, is material and considered to be complex and subject to judgments. The complexity mainly relates to various discounts, incentives and scheme offers, diverse range of market presence and complex contractual agreements/commercial terms across those markets. Therefore, there is a risk of revenue being misstated as a result of inaccurate estimates of discounts and rebates. The Group also focuses on revenue as a key performance measure, which could create an incentive for overstating revenue by influencing the computation of rebates and discounts. Considering the materiality of amounts involved, significant judgements related to estimation of rebates and discounts, the same has been considered as a key audit matter. This matter has also been reported as key audit matter to the audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements of Dabur International Limited, a subsidiary of the Holding Company, by an independent firm of Chartered Accountants vide its report dated 23 May, 2020.Our key procedures included, but were not limited to, the following: a) Assessed the appropriateness of the Group's revenue recognition accounting policies, including those relating to rebates and trade discounts by comparing with the applicable accounting standards; b) Tested the design and operating effectiveness of the general IT control environment and the manual controls for recognition of revenue, calculation of discounts and rebates; c) Performed test of details: i. Tested, on a sample basis, sales transactions to the underlying supporting documentation which includes goods dispatch notes and shipping documents; ii. Reviewed, on a sample basis, sales agreements and the underlying contractual terms related to delivery of goods and rebates to assess the Group's revenue recognition policies with reference to the requirements of the applicable accounting standards; iii.

Tested, on a sample basis, discounts and rebates recorded during the year to the relevant approvals and supporting documentation which includes assessing the terms and conditions defined in the prevalent schemes and customer contracts; v. Obtained supporting documentation for a sample of credit notes issued after the year end to determine whether the transaction was recognized in the correct accounting period; and vi. Assessed if there is any modification to, or other impact on the contracts with customers due to COVID 19 outbreak. d) Compared the discount, incentives and rebates of the current year with the prior year for variance/trend analysis and where relevant, conducted further inquiries and testing to corroborate the variances by considering both internal and external benchmarks, overlaying our understanding of industry practices and recent changes in economic environment; and e) Assessed the appropriateness of the Group's description of the accounting policy, disclosures related to discounts, incentives and rebates and whether these are adequately presented in the consolidated financial statements. B. Litigations and claims - provisions and contingent liabilities Refer note 47A and 48 to the consolidated financial statements.The Group is involved in direct, indirect tax and other litigations ('litigations') that are pending with different statutory authorities. The level of management judgement associated with determining the need for, and the quantum of, provisions for any liabilities arising from these litigations is considered to be high. This judgement is dependent on a number of significant assumptions and assessments which involves interpreting the various applicable rules, regulations, practices and considering precedents in the various jurisdictions. Our key procedures included, but not limited to, the following: a) Assessed the appropriateness of the Group's accounting policies relating to provisions and contingent liability by comparing with the applicable accounting standards; b) Assessed the Group's process and the underlying controls for identification of the pending litigations and completeness for financial reporting and also for monitoring of significant developments in relation to such pending litigations; c) Assessed the Group's assumptions and estimates in respect of litigations, including the liabilities or provisions recognized or contingent liabilities disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. This involved assessing the probability of an unfavorable outcome of a given proceeding and the reliability of estimates of related amounts;Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements266 267 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter This matter is considered as a key audit matter, in view of the uncertainty regarding the outcome of these litigations, the significance of the amounts involved and the subjectivity involved in management's judgement as to whether the amount should be recognized as a provision or only disclosed as contingent liability in the consolidated financial statements. This matter has also been reported as key audit matter to the audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements of Dabur International Limited, a subsidiary of the Holding Company, by an independent firm of Chartered Accountants vide its report dated 23 May, 2020.d) Performed substantive procedures on the underlying calculations supporting the provisions recorded; e) Assessed the management's conclusions through understanding relevant judicial precedents in similar cases and the applicable rules and regulations; f) Obtained legal opinions from the Group's external legal counsel, where appropriate; g) Engaged subject matter specialists to gain an understanding of the current status of litigations and monitored changes in the disputes, if any, through discussions with the management and by reading external advice received by the Group, where relevant, to validate management's conclusions; and h) Assessed the appropriateness of the Group's description of the accounting policy, disclosures related to litigations and whether these are adequately presented in the consolidated financial statements.

Instrument valued at amortized cost:a) Non-convertible debentures; b) Bond; and c) Fixed deposits 2.

This is considered to be a significant area in view of the materiality of amounts involved, judgements involved in determining of impairment/ recoverability of instruments measured at amortized cost which includes assessment of market data/conditions and financial indicators of the investee and judgements in selecting the valuation basis and the complexities involved in the valuation of instruments carried at FVTOCI which includes assessment of the available trading yield of relevant instruments and impact of the COVID 19 outbreak on the assumptions considered for such fair valuations. This matter has also been reported as key audit matter to the audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements of Dabur International Limited, a subsidiary of the Holding Company, by an independent firm of Chartered Accountants vide its report dated 23 May, 2020.Our key procedures included, but not limited to, the following: a) Assessed the appropriateness of the relevant accounting policies of the Group, including those relating to recognition and measurement of financial instrument by comparing with the applicable accounting standards; b) For instrument valued at fair value: i.

Recoverability of goodwill pertaining to step down subsidiaries companies Refer note 7D to the consolidated financial statements.The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at 31 March, 2020 carries goodwill amounting to 335.97 crores. This goodwill was recorded on the acquisition of step down subsidiaries in earlier years. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually at the cash generating unit level, whereby the carrying amount of the cash generating unit (including goodwill) is compared with the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit. The recoverable amount is determined on the basis of the value in use which is the present value of future cash flows of the cash generating unit. The present value is determined using discounted cash flow model. The Group's approved annual plans forms the starting point which is then updated with assumptions of long term growth rates. This also takes into account expectations about future market developments and other macroeconomic factors, including assessing the impact of the COVID 19 outbreak in the current year on such assumptions. The discounting is based on weighted average cost of capital of the cash generating unit. The result of this evaluation is highly dependent on management estimates, which among others include, the expected business and earnings forecasts for future years, the assumed long-term growth rates and the discount rate used and is therefore subject to considerable judgement.Our key procedures included, but not limited to, the following: a) Read group audit instructions, received from the principal auditor, in relation to testing of goodwill for impairment; b) Assessed the appropriateness of the Group's accounting policies, including those relating to recognition, measurement and impairment of goodwill by comparing with the applicable accounting standards; c) Assessed the appropriateness of the significant assumptions as well as the Group's valuation model with the support of our valuation specialists. This included a discussion of the expected development of the business and results as well as of the underlying assumptions used with those responsible for the planning process.

We also assessed the relevant skill set/experience of the management expert in respect of carrying out the valuation; d) Compared the discount rate used (in particular the underlying parameters such as risk free rate, market risk premium and the beta factor) with the publicly available information and also checked mathematical accuracy of the valuation model; e) Evaluated the appropriateness of the weighted average cost of capital considered in the valuation; f) Assessed the robustness of financial projections prepared by management by comparing projections for previous financial years with actual results realized and considering recent changes in global economic environment and analysed significant deviations, if any; g) Performed a sensitivity analysis for reasonably possible changes in the sales growth, discount rate applied and the long-term growth rate; and h) Assessed the appropriateness of the Group's description of the accounting policy and disclosures related to goodwill and impairment testing and whether these are adequately presented in the consolidated financial statements.The following key audit matter with respect to the audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements of Dabur International Limited, a subsidiary of the Holding Company, has been reported by an independent firm of Chartered Accountants vide its report dated 23 May, 2020 and has reproduced by us as under:Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements268 269 Management ReportsFinancial Statements 268 269 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 Information other than the Consolidated Financial Statements and Auditor's Report thereon 6.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements 7. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been approved by the Holding Company's Board of Directors. The Holding Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view of the consolidated state of affairs (consolidated financial position), consolidated profit or loss (consolidated financial performance including other comprehensive income), consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group including its joint venture in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Ind AS specified under Section 133 of the Act.

Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the companies included in the Group and of its joint venture. Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 10. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 11. As part of an audit in accordance with Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3) (i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls; evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management; conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements270 271 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 significant doubt on the ability of the Group and its joint ventures to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and its joint ventures to cease to continue as a going concern; evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities within the Group, and its joint venture, to express an opinion on the financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of financial statements of such entities included in the financial statements, of which we are the independent auditors. For the other entities included in the financial statements, which have been audited by the other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. 12. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 13. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. 14. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

No.: FCS 4311Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements280 281 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 1. GROUP INFORMATION Dabur India Limited (the 'Holding Company') is a domestic public limited company with registered office situated at 8/3, Asaf Ali Road, New Delhi - 110002 and is listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange Limited (BSE) and National Stock Exchange of India Limited (NSE). The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Holding Company, its subsidiaries and joint venture collectively hereinafter referred to as the 'Group'. The Group is one of the leading global fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) players' dealing in consumer care and food products. It has wide network of operations in local as well as foreign markets. 2. GENERAL INFORMATION AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH IND AS These consolidated financial statements ('financial statements') of the Group have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards ('Ind AS') specified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 ('the Act') and other relevant provisions of the Act. The Group has uniformly applied the accounting policies during the periods presented. The financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees ('') which is also the functional currency of the Holding Company. The financial statements for the year ended 31 March, 2020 were authorized and approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 27 May, 2020. The revision to financial statements is permitted by the Board of Directors after obtaining necessary approvals or at the instance of regulatory authorities as per provisions of the Act. 3. BASIS OF PREPARATION The financial statements have been prepared on going concern basis in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in India. Further, the financial statements have been prepared on historical cost basis except for certain financial assets and financial liabilities and share based payments which are measured at fair values as explained in relevant accounting policies. Amount in the financial statements are presented in crores, unless otherwise stated. Certain amounts that are required to be disclosed and do not appear due to rounding-off are expressed as 0.00 crores.4. BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION SubsidiariesSubsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the relevant activities of the entity. The Group can have power over the investee even if it owns less than majority voting rights i.e. rights arising from other contractual arrangements. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. Statement of profit and loss (including other comprehensive income ('OCI')) of subsidiaries acquired or disposed off during the period are recognized from the effective date of acquisition, or up to the effective date of disposal, as applicable. The Group combines the financial statements of the Holding Company and its subsidiaries line by line adding together like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses. Intercompany transactions, balances and un-realized gains/ losses on transactions between group companies are eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. Non-controlling interests, presented as part of equity, represent the portion of a subsidiary's Statement of Profit and Loss and net assets that is not held by the Group. Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss balance (including other comprehensive income ('OCI')) is attributed to the equity holders of the Holding Company and to the non-controlling interest basis the respective ownership interests and such balance is attributed even if this results in controlling interests having a deficit balance. The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in a loss of control as transactions with equity owners of the Group. Such a change in ownership interest results in an adjustment between the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests to reflect their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount of the adjustment to non- controlling interests and any consideration paid or received is recognized within equity. Joint venture Interest in joint venture is accounted for using the equity method, after initially being recognized at cost. The Summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information for the year ended 31 March, 2020 (All amounts in J crores, unless otherwise stated)Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements280 281 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 carrying amount of the investment is adjusted thereafter for the post acquisition change in the share of net assets of the investee, adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies of the Group. The Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (including the OCI) includes the Group's share of the results of the operations of the investee. Dividends received or receivable from joint ventures are recognized as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment. 5. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Ministry of Corporate Affairs (\"MCA\") notifies new accounting standards or amendments to the existing accounting standards. There is no such notification which would have been applicable from 01 April, 2020. 6. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The financial statements have been prepared using the significant accounting policies and measurement basis summarized below: a. Current / non-current classification: All assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-current as per the Group's normal operating cycle and other criteria set-out in the Act. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and non-current liabilities, as the case may be. b. Business combinations The Group applies the acquisition method in accounting for business combinations. The consideration transferred by the Group to obtain control of a subsidiary is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of assets transferred, liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their acquisition-date fair values. Goodwill is measured as excess of the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration transferred, the amount recognized for non-controlling interests and fair value of any previous interest held, over the fair value of the net of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is in excess of the aggregate mentioned above, the resulting gain on bargain purchase is recognized in OCI and accumulated in equity as capital reserve. However, if there is no clear evidence of bargain purchase, the entity recognizes the gain directly in equity as capital reserve, without routing the same through other comprehensive income. Business combinations involving entities or businesses under common control have been accounted for using the pooling of interest method. The assets and liabilities of the combining entities are reflected at their carrying amounts. No adjustments have been made to reflect fair values, or to recognize any new assets or liabilities. c. Revenue recognition: Revenue from sale of products is recognised when control of products being sold is transferred to customer and when there are no longer any unfulfilled obligations. The performance obligations in contracts are considered as fulfilled in accordance with the terms agreed with the respective customers. Revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable and are accounted for net of returns, rebates and trade discount. Sales, as disclosed, are exclusive of goods and services tax, where applicable. The Group considers the terms of the contract and its customary business practices to determine the transaction price. The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties (for example taxes collected on behalf of government). The consideration promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed consideration, variable consideration (if reversal is less likely in future), or both. The transaction price is allocated by the Group to each performance obligation in an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods to the customer. For each performance obligation identified, the Group determines at contract inception whether it satisfies the performance obligation over time or satisfies the performance obligation at a point in time. When either party to a contract has performed its obligation, an entity shall present the contract in the balance sheet as a contract asset or a contract liability, depending on the relationship between the Group's performance and the customer's payment. Income from export incentives such as duty drawback, premium on sale of import licenses and lease license fee are recognized on accrual basis Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements282 283 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 when no significant uncertainties as to the amount of consideration that would be derived and as to its ultimate collection exist. Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the lease, except for contingent rental income which is recognized when it arises and where scheduled increase in rent compensates the lessor for expected inflationary costs. Interest income is recognized using effective interest method. Dividend income is recognized at the time when the right to receive is established by the reporting date. Other incomes have been recognized on accrual basis in the financial statements, except when there is uncertainty of collection. d. Property, plant and equipment: Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. These tangible assets are held for use in production, supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes. Cost comprises of purchase cost, freight, duties, taxes and other expenses directly incidental to acquisition, bringing the asset to the location and installation including site restoration up to the time when the asset is ready for intended use. Such costs also include borrowing cost if the recognition criteria are met. When a major inspection / repair occur, its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of the property, plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. Any remaining carrying amount of the cost of previous inspection / repair is derecognized. All other repair and maintenance are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as incurred. Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is provided over the useful lives of assets as specified in Schedule II to the Act except where the management, has estimated useful life of an asset supported by the technical assessment, external or internal i.e., higher or lower from the indicative useful life given under Schedule II. The management believes that these estimated useful lives are realistic and reflect fair approximation of the period over which the assets are likely to be used. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:Description Useful lives(upto) Leasehold land Over lease period Building 60 years Plant and machinery 15 years Furniture and fixtures 10 years Vehicles 8 years Office equipment 10 years The residual value and useful life is reviewed annually and any deviation is accounted for as a change in estimate. Components relevant to property, plant and equipment, where significant, are separately depreciated on straight-line basis in terms of their life span assessed by technical evaluation in item specific context. For new projects, all direct expenses and direct overheads (excluding services of non-exclusive nature provided by employees in Group's regular payroll) are capitalized till the assets are ready for intended use. During disposal of property, plant and equipment, any profit earned / loss sustained towards excess / shortfall of sale value vis-a-vis carrying cost of assets is accounted for in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. e. Capital work-in-progress and intangible assets under development: Capital work-in-progress and intangible assets under development represents expenditure incurred in respect of capital projects / intangible assets under development and are carried at cost. Cost comprises of purchase cost, related acquisition expenses, development / construction costs, borrowing costs and other direct expenditure. f. Investment property: Properties held to earn rentals or / and for capital appreciation or both but not for sale in the ordinary course of business, use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes, are categorized as investment properties. These are measured initially at cost of acquisition, including transaction costs and other direct costs attributable to bringing asset to its working condition for intended use. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss, if any. The cost shall also include borrowing cost if the recognition criteria are met. Said assets are depreciated on straight line basis based on expected life span of assets which is in accordance with Schedule II of the Act.Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements282 283 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 Significant parts of the property are depreciated separately based on their specific useful lives as follows: Description Useful lives(upto) Leasehold land Over lease period Building 60 years Any gain or loss on disposal of investment properties is recognized in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. Fair value of investments properties under each category are disclosed under note 7C to the financial statements. Fair values are determined based on the evaluation performed by an accredited external independent valuer applying a recognized and accepted valuation model or estimation based on available sources of information from market. Transfers to or from the investment property is made only when there is a change in use and the same is made at the carrying amount of investment property. g. Goodwill Goodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the consideration transferred over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, measured in accordance with Ind AS 103 'Business Combinations'. Goodwill is considered to have indefinite useful life and hence is not subject to amortization but tested for impairment annually. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. h. Intangible assets: Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost of acquisition. The cost comprises of purchase price and directly attributable costs of bringing the assets to its working condition for intended use. Intangible assets arising on acquisition of business are measured at fair value as at date of acquisition. In case of internally generated assets, measured at development cost subject to satisfaction of recognition criteria (identifiability, control and future economic benefit) in accordance with Ind AS 38 'Intangible Assets'. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment loss, if any. Intangible Assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic life. The amortization expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. Amortization of intangible assets such as softwares is computed on a straight-line basis, at the rates representing estimated useful life of up to 5 years. The brands and trademarks acquired as part of business combinations normally have a remaining legal life of not exceeding ten years but is renewable every ten years at little cost and is well established. i. Government subsidy / grants: Government grant is recognized only when there is a reasonable assurance that the entity will comply with the conditions attached to them and the grants will be received. Subsidy related to assets is recognized as deferred income which is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss on systematic basis over the useful life of the assets. Purchase of assets and receipts of related grants are separately disclosed in Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow. Grants related to income are treated as other operating income in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss subject to due disclosure about the nature of grant. j. Impairment of non-financial assets: Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment on annual basis. If on testing, any impairment exists, the carrying amount of goodwill is reduced to the extent of any impairment loss and such loss is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. Other assets At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication based on internal / external factors, that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or the cash generating unit (CGU) is estimated. If such recoverable amount of the asset or CGU to which the asset belongs is less than its carrying amount. The carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount and the reduction is treated as an impairment loss and is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. If, at the reporting date, there is an indication that a previously assessed impairment loss no longer exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed and the asset is reflected at the recoverable amount. Impairment losses previously recognized are accordingly reversed in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements284 285 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 k. Impairment of financial assets: In accordance with Ind AS 109 'Financial Instruments', the Group applies expected credit loss ('ECL') model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss for financial assets. ECL is the weighted-average of difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to the Group in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at the original effective interest rate, with the respective risks of default occurring as the weights. When estimating the cash flows, the Group is required to consider: All contractual terms of the financial assets (including prepayment and extension) over the expected life of the assets; Cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms. l. Trade receivables: In respect of trade receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach of Ind AS 109 'Financial Instruments', which requires measurement of loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. Lifetime expected credit losses are the expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. m. Other financial assets: In respect of its other financial assets, the Group assesses if the credit risk on those financial assets has increased significantly since initial recognition. If the credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses, else at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses. When making this assessment, the Group uses the change in the risk of a default occurring over the expected life of the financial asset. To make that assessment, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial asset as at the balance sheet date with the risk of a default occurring on the financial asset as at the date of initial recognition and considers reasonable and supportable information, that is available without undue cost or effort, that is indicative of significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition. The Group assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the financial asset is determined to have low credit risk at the balance sheet date. n. Financial instruments: Initial recognition and measurementFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument and are measured initially at fair value adjusted for transaction costs, except for those carried at fair value through profit or loss which are measured initially at fair value. Subsequent measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities is described below: Non-derivative financial assets Subsequent measurement Financial assets carried at amortized cost A financial asset is measured at the amortized cost, if both the following conditions are met: a. The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows; and b. Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest ('SPPI') on the principal amount outstanding. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate ('EIR') method. Investments in other equity instruments Investments in equity instruments which are held for trading are classified as at fair value through profit or loss ('FVTPL'). For all other equity instruments, the Group makes an irrevocable choice upon initial recognition, on an instrument by instrument basis, to classify the same either as at fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVTOCI') or fair value through profit or loss ('FVTPL'). Amounts presented in other comprehensive income are not subsequently transferred to profit or loss. However, the Group transfers the cumulative gain or loss within equity. Dividends on such investments are recognized in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Debt instruments Debt instruments are initially measured at amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVTOCI') or fair value through profit or loss ('FVTPL') till de-recognition on the basis of: a. the entity's business model for managing the financial assets; and b. the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. a. Measured at amortized cost Financial assets that are held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest, are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the EIR method less impairment, if any. The amortization of EIR and loss arising Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements284 285 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 from impairment, if any is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. b. Measured at fair value through other comprehensive income Financial assets that are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both, selling financial assets and collecting contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest, are subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. Fair value movements are recognized in the other comprehensive income ('OCI'). Interest income measured using the EIR method and impairment losses, if any are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. On de-recognition, cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in OCI is reclassified from the equity to 'other income' in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. c. Measured at fair value through profit or loss A financial asset not classified as either amortized cost or FVTOCI, is classified as FVTPL. Such financial assets are measured at fair value with all changes in fair value, including interest income and dividend income if any, recognized as 'other income' in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. Investments in mutual funds Investments in mutual funds are measured at FVTPL. De-recognition of financial assetsA financial asset is primarily de-recognized when the contractual rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired or the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset. Non-derivative financial liabilities Subsequent measurementSubsequent to initial recognition, all non-derivative financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. De-recognition of financial liabilitiesA financial liability is de-recognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.Derivative financial instruments The Group holds derivative financial instruments in the form of future contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposure. The counterparty for these contracts are scheduled commercial banks / regulated brokerage firms. Although these derivatives constitute hedges from an economic perspective, they do not qualify for hedge accounting under Ind AS 109 'Financial Instruments' and consequently are categorized as financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. The resulting exchange gain or loss is included in other income / expenses and attributable transaction costs are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss when incurred. Financial guarantee contracts Financial guarantee contracts are those contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the specified party fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are recognized as a financial liability at the time the guarantee is issued at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the amount of expected loss allowance determined as per impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 'Financial Instruments' and the amount recognized less cumulative amortization. Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. o. Fair value measurement: The Group measures financial instruments, such as, derivatives at fair value at each Consolidated Balance Sheet date. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: In the principal market for the asset or liability; or In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group.Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements286 287 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 \u2014 Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 \u2014 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable Level 3 \u2014 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable For assets and liabilities that are recognized in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period. The Management determines the policies and procedures for both recurring fair value measurement, such as derivative instruments and unquoted financial assets measured at fair value, and for non-recurring measurement, such as assets held for distribution in discontinued operations. p. Leases: Where the Group is the lessee Right of use assets and lease liabilities For any new contracts entered into on or after 1 April, 2019 (the transition approach has been explained and disclosed in Note 49), the Group considers whether a contract is, or contains a lease. A lease is defined as 'a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to use an asset (the underlying asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration'. Classification of leases The Group enters into leasing arrangements for various assets. The assessment of the lease is based on several factors, including, but not limited to, transfer of ownership of leased asset at end of lease term, lessee's option to extend/purchase etc. Recognition and initial measurementAt lease commencement date, the Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet. The right-of-use asset is measured at cost, which is made up of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any initial direct costs incurred by the Group, an estimate of any costs to dismantle and remove the asset at the end of the lease (if any), and any lease payments made in advance of the lease commencement date (net of any incentives received). Subsequent measurement The Group depreciates the right-of-use assets on a straight-line basis from the lease commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of- use asset or the end of the lease term. The Group also assesses the right-of-use asset for impairment when such indicators exist. At lease commencement date, the Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments unpaid at that date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease if that rate is readily available or the Group's incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability are made up of fixed payments (including in substance fixed payments) and variable payments based on an index or rate. Subsequent to initial measurement, the liability will be reduced for payments made and increased for interest. It is re-measured to reflect any reassessment or modification, or if there are changes in in-substance fixed payments. When the lease liability is re-measured, the corresponding adjustment is reflected in the right-of-use asset. The Group has elected to account for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets using the practical expedients. Instead of recognizing a right-of-use asset and lease liability, the payments in relation to these are recognized as an expense in consolidated statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Where the Group is the lessorLeases in which the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are classified as operating leases. Rental income from operating lease is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease, except when the lease rentals, increase are in line with general inflation index. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents are recognized as revenue in the period in which they are earned.Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements286 287 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 Leases are classified as finance leases when substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership transfer from the Group to the lessee. Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as receivables at the Group's net investment in the leases. Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment outstanding in respect of the lease. q. Inventories: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes purchase price, duties, transport, handing costs and other costs directly attributable to the acquisition and bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. The basis of determination of cost is as follows: Raw material, packing material and stock-in-trade valued on moving weighted average basis; Stores and spares valued on weighted average basis; Work-in-progress valued at cost of input valued at moving weighted average basis plus overheads up till the stage of completion; and Finished goods valued at cost of input valued at moving weighted average basis plus appropriate overheads. r . Employee benefits: Liabilities in respect of employee benefits to employees are provided for as follows: Current employee benefits a. Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits that are expected to be settled wholly within 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service are recognized in respect of employees' services up to the end of the reporting period and are measured at the amounts expected to be incurred when the liabilities are settled. The liabilities are presented as current employee dues payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. b. Employees' State Insurance ('ESI') is provided on the basis of actual liability accrued and paid to authorities. c. The Group has adopted a policy on compensated absences which are both accumulating and non-accumulating in nature. The expected cost of accumulating compensated absences is determined by actuarial valuation performed by an independent actuary at each balance sheet date using projected unit credit method on the additional amount expected to be paid / availed as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the balance sheet date. Expense on non-accumulating compensated absences is recognized in the period in which the absences occur. d. Expense in respect of other short-term benefits is recognized on the basis of the amount paid or payable for the period during which services are rendered by the employee. Post separation employee benefit plan a. Defined benefit plan Post separation benefits of Directors are accounted for on the basis of actuarial valuation as per Ind AS 19 'Employee Benefits'. Gratuity liability accounted for on the basis of actuarial valuation as per Ind AS 19 'Employee Benefits'. Liability recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in respect of gratuity is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of each reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by an independent actuary using the projected unit credit method. The present value of defined benefit is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows by reference to market yield at the end of each reporting period on government bonds that have terms approximate to the terms of the related obligation. The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefit expense in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. Group contributes its share of contribution to Employees' Provident Fund Scheme administered by a separate trust with its obligation to make good the shortfall, if any, in trust fund arising on account of difference between the return on investments of the trust and the interest rate on provident fund dues notified periodically by the Central Government and any expected loss in investment. Liability recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in respect of Dabur India E.P .F trust is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of each reporting period less the fair value of plan assets on the basis of actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method. Actuarial gain / loss pertaining to gratuity and post separation benefits are accounted for as OCI. All remaining components of costs are accounted for in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements288 289 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 b. Defined contribution plans Liability for superannuation fund is provided on the basis of the premium paid to insurance company in respect of employees covered under Superannuation Fund Policy. s. Taxation: Tax expense recognized in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss comprises the sum of deferred tax and current tax except the ones recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Current tax is determined as the tax payable in respect of taxable income for the year and is computed in accordance with relevant tax regulations of the respective jurisdictions. Current income tax relating to items recognized outside profit or loss is recognized outside profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or in equity). Minimum Alternate Tax ('MAT') credit entitlement is recognized as an asset only when and to the extent there is convincing evidence that normal income tax will be paid during the specified period. In the year in which MAT credit becomes eligible to be recognized as an asset, the said asset is created by way of a credit to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss and shown as MAT credit entitlement. This is reviewed at each balance sheet date and the carrying amount of MAT credit entitlement is written down to the extent it is not reasonably certain that normal income tax will be paid during the specified period. Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit under provisions of the Income Tax Acts of the respective jurisdictions. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax relating to items recognized outside Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss is recognized outside Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (either in other comprehensive income or in equity). t. Provisions, contingent liability and contingent assets: Provisions are recognized only when there is a present obligation, as a result of past events and when a reliable estimate of the amount of obligation can be made at the reporting date. These estimates are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates. Provisions are discounted to their present values, where the time value of money is material. Contingent liability is disclosed for: a. Possible obligations which will be confirmed only by future events not wholly within the control of the Group; or b. Present obligations arising from past events where it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation cannot be made. Contingent assets are neither recognized nor disclosed except when realization of income is virtually certain, related asset is recognized. u. Foreign currency translation: Foreign currency transactions are recorded in the functional currency, by applying the exchange rate between the functional currency and the foreign currency at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency monetary items outstanding at the balance sheet date are converted to functional currency using the closing rate. Non-monetary items denominated in a foreign currency which are carried at historical cost are reported using the exchange rate at the date of the transactions. Exchange differences arising on monetary items on settlement, or restatement as at reporting date, at rates different from those at which they were initially recorded, are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss in the year in which they arise. Functional and reporting currencies of foreign operations are different from the reporting currency of the Holding Company. For all the foreign operations of the Group, all assets and liabilities (excluding equity share capital and opening reserves and surplus) are translated into Indian Rupees ('') using the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date. Equity share capital, reserves and surplus are carried at historical cost. Revenues, costs and expenses are translated using the weighted-average exchange rate during the reporting period. The resultant currency translation difference is recognized as foreign currency translation reserve under the head 'other equity'. v. Share based payments - Employee Stock Option Scheme ('ESOP'): The fair value of options granted under Employee Stock Option Plan is recognized as an employee benefits expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options. The total expense is recognized over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each period, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting and service Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements288 289 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 conditions. It recognizes the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. Upon exercise of share options, the proceeds received are allocated to share capital up to the par value of the shares issued with any excess being recorded as share premium. w. Operating segments: Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker ('CODM') of the Group. The CODM is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments of the Group. x. Earnings per share: Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit for the period attributed to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period is adjusted for the effects of all potentially dilutive equity shares. y. Research and development: Expenditure on research is recognized as an expense when it is incurred. Expenditure on development which does not meet the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset is recognized as an expense when it is incurred. Items of property, plant and equipment and acquired intangible assets utilized for research and development are capitalized and depreciated / amortized in accordance with the policies stated for Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets. z. Borrowing cost: Borrowing cost consists of interest and other costs incurred in connection with the borrowing of funds and also include exchange differences to the extent regarded as an adjustment to the same. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition and/or construction of a qualifying asset are capitalized during the period of time that is necessary to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use or sale. A qualifying asset is one that necessarily takes substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use. All other borrowing costs are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as incurred. aa. Cash and cash equivalents: For the purpose of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cheques in hand, bank balances, demand deposits with banks where the original maturity is three months or less and other short-term highly liquid investments net of outstanding bank overdrafts and cash credit facilities as they are considered an integral part of the Group's cash management. ab. Assets held for sale: The Group classifies assets as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale rather than through continuing use of the assets and actions required to complete such sale indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan to sell will be made or that the decision to sell will be withdrawn. Also, such assets are classified as held for sale, if the management expects to complete the sale within one year from the date of classification. Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and the fair value less cost to sell. ac. Significant management judgement in applying accounting policies and estimation uncertainty: The preparation of the Group's financial statements requires the Management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Evaluation of indicators for impairment of assets The evaluation of applicability of indicators of impairment of assets requires, the management to make an assessment of several external and internal factors which could result in deterioration of recoverable amount of the assets. Classification of leases The Group enters into leasing arrangements for various premises. The assessment (including measurement) of the lease is based on several factors, including, but not limited to, transfer of ownership of leased asset at end of lease term, lessee's option to extend/terminate etc. After the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to extend or to terminate. Recoverability of advances / receivables At each balance sheet date, based on historical default rates observed over expected life, the management assesses the expected credit losses on outstanding receivables and advances. Defined benefit obligation ('DBO') Management's estimate of the DBO is based on a number of underlying assumptions such as standard rates of inflation, mortality, discount rate and Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements290 291 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 anticipation of future salary increases. Variation in these assumptions may significantly impact the DBO amount and the annual defined benefit expenses. Provisions At each balance sheet date basis the management judgment, changes in facts and legal aspects, the Group assesses the requirement of provisions against the outstanding contingent liabilities. However, the actual future outcome may be different from this judgement. Contingencies Contingent liabilities may arise from the ordinary course of business in relation to claims against the Group, refer note 47. By their nature, contingencies will be resolved only when one or more uncertain future events occur or fail to occur. The assessment of the existence, and potential quantum, of contingencies inherently involves the exercise of significant judgments and the use of estimates regarding the outcome of future events. Fair value measurements Management applies valuation techniques to determine the fair value of financial instruments (where active market quotes are not available) and share based payments. This involves developing estimates and assumptions consistent with how market participants would price the instrument. The Group engages third party valuers, where required, to perform the valuation. Information about the valuation techniques and inputs used in determining the fair value of various assets, liabilities and share based payments are disclosed in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Inventories The Group estimates the net realizable values of inventories, taking into account the most reliable evidence available at each reporting date. The future realization of these inventories may be affected by future demand or other market-driven changes that may reduce future selling prices. Useful lives of depreciable / amortizable assets Management reviews its estimate of the useful lives of depreciable / amortizable assets at each reporting date, based on the expected utility of the assets. Uncertainties in these estimates relate to technical and economic obsolescence that may change the utility of assets. Valuation of investment property Investment property is stated at cost. However, as per Ind AS 40 'Investment Property', there is a requirement to disclose fair value as at the balance sheet date. The Group engaged independent valuation specialists to determine the fair value of its investment property as at reporting date. Business combinations and intangible assets The Holding Company uses valuation techniques when determining the fair values of certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination. In particular, the fair value of contingent consideration is dependent on the outcome of many variables including the acquirees' future profitability. These valuations are conducted by independent valuation experts. Income taxes Significant judgements are involved in estimating budgeted profits for the purpose of paying advance tax, determining the provision for income taxes, including amount expected to be paid / recovered for uncertain tax positions (refer note 43). The extent to which deferred tax assets/minimum alternate tax credit can be recognized is based on management's assessment of the probability of the future taxable income against which the deferred tax assets/ minimum alternate tax credit can be utilized. Recognition of deferred tax liability on undistributed profits The extent to which the Holding Company can control the timing of reversal of deferred tax liability on undistributed profits of its subsidiaries requires judgement.Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements290 291 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 7A PROPERTY , PLANT AND EQUIPMENT The changes in the carrying value of property, plant and equipment for the year ended 31 March, 2019 and 31 March, 2020 are as follows: Description Leasehold landFreehold landBuildings Leased Buildings**Plant and equipmentFurniture and fixturesVehicles Office equipmentTotal Gross block Balance as at 762.64 -

The goodwill amounting to 335.97 crores (31 March, 2019: 336.07 crores) acquired through business combination has been entirely allocated to 'Consumer Care Business' segment of the Group. ii) Allocation of goodwill to cash generating units (CGU): Goodwill has been allocated to the following CGUs for impairment testing purpose with carrying amount of goodwill being significant in comparison with the entity's total carrying amount of goodwill with indefinite useful lives: Particulars 31 March, 2020 31 March, 2019 Goodwill relating to Hobi Group and Namaste Group being part of consumer care business 314.29 314.29 The recoverable amount of the above mentioned Groups, for impairment testing is determined based on value-in-use calculations which uses cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by Management covering a five-year period, as the Group believes this to be the most appropriate timescale for reviewing and considering annual performance before applying a fixed terminal value multiple to the final cash flows. Cash flows beyond the five-year period were extrapolated using estimate rates stated below. iii) Impairment of Goodwill: As at 31 March, 2020, the Group recognised impairment in the value of goodwill amounting to Nil crores (31 March, 2019: 75.34 cores). The impairment charge of the previous year pertains to the Hobi Group (represented by M/s Hobi Kozmetic and M/s Rapazarlama, Turkey) in view of currency devaluation in the country of its operation. Such impairment was recognized as an expense during the previous year and was included in 'exceptional items' in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. iv) Key assumptions used for value in use calculations are as follows: *# The Group prepares its cash flow forecasts based on the most recent financial budgets approved by management with projected revenue growth rate ranges from 5% to 10% for the five-year period. The growth rates used for extrapolation of cash flows beyond the five-year period covered by the forecast ranges from 1.5% to 3%. The rate used to discount the forecasted cash flows ranges from 5% to 22%. The financial projections basis which the future cash flows have been estimated consider the increase in economic uncertainties due to COVID-19, reassessment of the discount rates, revisiting the growth rates factored while arriving at terminal value and subjecting these variables to sensitivity analysis. * Discount rates - Management estimates discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the risks specific to the CGU, taking into consideration the time value of money and individual risks of the underlying assets that have not been incorporated in the cash flow estimates. The discount rate calculation is based on the specific circumstances of the Group and its operating segments and is derived from its weighted average cost of capital (WACC).Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements294 295 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 # Growth rates - The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts. Management determines the budgeted growth rates based on past performance and its expectations on market development. The weighted average growth rates used were consistent with industry reports. The Management has performed sensitivity analysis around the base assumptions consequent to the change in estimated future economic conditions on account of possible effects relating to COVID-19 and has concluded that no reasonable changes in key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount of the CGU to be less than the carrying value. 7E OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS The changes in the carrying value of intangible asset for the year ended 31 March, 2019 and 31 March, 2020 are as follows : Description Brands / trademarksComputer softwareTotal Gross block Balance as at 1 April, 2018 14.27 49.32 63.59 Addition for the year 20.00 7.91 27.91 Transfer from capital work-in-progress -

Pursuant to judgement by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India dated 28 February 2019, it was held that basic wages, for the purpose of provident fund, should include certain allowances which are common for all employees. However, there is uncertainty with respect to the applicability of the judgement and period from which the same applies and accordingly, the Group has not provided for any liability on account of this. The Group has certain ongoing direct tax litigations in relation to which the management believes that there will be no outflow of resources embodying economic benefits that would be required to settle such obligations. However, in the event of any unfavourable outcome in respect to such litigations, that liability would be settled against unused minimum alternate tax credits which have not been recognized as an asset in the books of accounts as been explained in note 27.3.

Hence, the Group is not able to reasonably ascertain the timing of the outflow. ii) Discounting obligation has been ignored considering that these disputes relate to Government Authorities. 49 INFORMATION ON LEASE TRANSACTIONS PURSUANT TO IND AS 116 - LEASES A Assets taken on lease The Group has leases for office building, warehouses, stores and related facilities and cars. With the exception of short-term leases and leases of low-value underlying assets, each lease is reflected on the balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. Variable lease payments which do not depend on an index or a rate are excluded from the initial measurement of the lease liability and right of use assets. The Group currently classifies its right-of-use assets in a consistent manner in leased buildings under property, plant and equipment. Each lease generally imposes a restriction that, unless there is a contractual right for the Group to sublease the asset to another party, the right-of-use asset can only be used by the Group. Some leases contain an option to extend the lease for a further term. The Group is prohibited from selling or pledging the underlying leased assets as security. For leases over office buildings, stores and other premises the Group must keep those properties in a good state of repair and return the properties in their original condition at the end of the lease. Further, the Group is required to pay maintenance fees in accordance with the lease contracts. i) Lease payments not included in measurement of lease liability The expense relating to payments not included in the measurement of the lease liability is as follows: Particulars 31 March, 2020 Short-term leases 17.33 Leases of low value assets 2.20 Variable lease payments 0.27 Total 19.80 ii) Total cash outflow for leases for the year ended 31 March, 2020 was 56.09 crores.Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements316 317 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 iii) Maturity of lease liabilities The lease liabilities are secured by the related underlying assets.

On transition, the adoption of new standard resulted in recognition of lease liability of Rs. 149.04 crores and corresponding right of use asset of Rs. 153.46 crores. For contracts in place as at 1 April, 2019, Group has elected to apply the definition of a lease from Ind AS 17 and has not applied Ind AS 116 to arrangements that were previously not identified as lease under Ind AS 17. The Group has elected not to include initial direct costs in the measurement of the right-of-use asset for operating leases in existence at the date of initial application of Ind AS 116, being 1 April, 2019. Instead of performing an impairment review on the right-of-use assets at the date of initial application, the Group has relied on its historic assessment as to whether leases were onerous immediately before the date of initial application of Ind AS 116. On transition, for leases previously accounted for as operating leases with a remaining lease term of less than 12 months and for leases of low-value assets the Group has applied the optional exemptions to not recognise right-of-use assets but to account for the lease expense on a straightline basis over the remaining lease term. For those leases previously classified as finance leases, the right-of-use asset and lease liability are measured at the date of initial application at the same amounts as under Ind AS 17 immediately before the date of initial application. The Group has benefited from the use of hindsight for determining the lease term when considering options to extend and terminate leases. On transition to Ind AS 116 the weighted average incremental borrowing rate applied to lease liabilities recognised was 10 %.

The Group's activities expose it to market risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The Board of Directors ('Board') oversee the management of these financial risks through its Risk Management Committee. The Risk Management Policy of the Group formulated by the Risk Management Committee and approved by the Board, states the Group's approach to address uncertainties in its endeavour to achieve its stated and implicit objectives. It prescribes the roles and responsibilities of the Group's management, the structure for managing risks and the framework for risk management. The framework seeks to identify, assess and mitigate financial risks in order to minimize potential adverse effects on the Group's financial performance. The following disclosures summarize the Group's exposure to financial risks and information regarding use of derivatives employed to manage exposures to such risks. Quantitative sensitivity analysis have been provided to reflect the impact of reasonably possible changes in market rates on the financial results, cash flows and financial position of the Group. A Market risk Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair value or future cash flows arising out of change in the price of a financial instrument. These include change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including investments and deposits, foreign currency receivables, payables and loans and borrowings. The Group manages market risk through a Risk Management Committee engaged in, inter alia, evaluation and identification of risk factors with the object of governing/mitigating them according to Group's objectives and declared policies in specific Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements332 333 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 context of impact thereof on various segments of financial instruments. The Board provides oversight and reviews the risk management policy on a quarterly basis. i) Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. In order to balance the Group's position with regards to interest income and interest expense and to manage the interest rate risk, treasury performs a comprehensive interest rate risk management. The Group is not exposed to significant interest rate risk as at the respective reporting dates. ii) Foreign currency risk The Group operates internationally with transactions entered into several currencies. Consequently the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk towards honouring of export/ import commitments. Management evaluates exchange rate exposure in this connection in terms if its established risk management policies which includes the use of derivatives like foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge risk of exposure in foreign currency. The carrying amounts of the Group's foreign currency denominated monetary items are as follows: Foreign currency exposure as at 31 March, 2020 USD EUR SGD AUD GBP NGN CHF KWD Total Export receivables 176.44 - - - - -181.27 Overseas creditors 106.58 4.92 -0.14 - -0.15 0.01 111.80 Advance to suppliers 9.53 - -3.17 0.23 - - -12.93 Advance from customers 4.85 0.18 -0.00 - - - - 5.03 Bank balances in Exchange Earner Foreign Currency (EEFC) accounts0.73 - - - - - - - 0.73 Packing credit loan (hedged through future contract) - - - - - - - - - Foreign currency exposure as at 31 March, 2019 USD EUR SGD AUD GBP 0.01 - -0.10 -78.78 Advance to suppliers 1.86 - - - - - - - 1.86 Advance from customers 1.53 - - - - - - - 1.53 Bank balances in Exchange Earner Foreign Currency (EEFC) accounts8.75 - - - - - - - 8.75 Packing credit loan (hedged through future contract) 55.32 - - - - - - -55.32 The above table represents total exposure of the Group towards foreign exchange denominated assets and liabilities.

To manage this, the Group periodically assesses the financial reliability of customers, taking into account the financial condition, current economic trends, and analysis of historical bad debts and ageing of account receivables. Individual risk limits are also set accordingly. The Group considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of asset and whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis throughout each reporting period. To assess whether there is a significant increase in credit risk the Group compares the risk of default occuring on the asset as at the reporting date with the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition. The Group considers reasonable and supportive forward-looking information.Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements334 335 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 Financial assets are written-off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, such as debtor failing to engage in a repayment plan with the Group. The Group provides for overdue outstanding for more than 90 days other than institutional customers which are evaluated on a case to case basis. The Group's concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables is low, as its customer's base is widely spread across local as well as foreign markets.

Unallocated 2.45 1.56 Total 813.89 833.56 60 CATEGORY WISE CLASSIFICATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The fair values of the financial assets and financial liabilities are defined as the price that would be received on sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values are consistent with those used for the financial year 2018-19. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: i) The fair values of investments in mutual fund units is based on the net asset value ('NAV') as stated by the issuers of these mutual fund units in the published statements as at balance sheet date. NAV represents the price at which the issuer will issue further units of mutual fund and the price at which issuers will redeem such units from the investors. ii) The fair values of other investments measured at FVTOCI and FVTPL are determined based on observable market data other than quoted prices in active market. iii) The carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost in the financial statements are a reasonable approximation of their fair values since the Group does not anticipate that the carrying amounts would be significantly different from the values that would eventually be received or settled.Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements334 335 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 Financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value in the financial statements and are grouped into three levels of the fair value hierarchy. The three levels are defined based on the observability of significant inputs to the measurement, as follows: Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability A The carrying values and fair values of financial instruments by categories as at 31 March, 2020 are as follows: * Particulars Carrying valueFair value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss ('FVTPL ') Investments in debt instruments Investments in mutual funds 573.73 573.73 - - Total 573.73 573.73 - - Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVTOCI') Investments in debt instruments 892.13 - 892.13 - Investments in equity instruments 0.02 - - 0.02 Total 892.15 - 892.13 0.02 Financial assets at amortised cost Non-current (i) Investments Investments in debt instruments 504.80 - - - Investments in joint venture 12.28 - - - (ii) Loans Security deposits 24.64 - - - (iii) Others financial assets 528.48 - - - Total 1,070.20 - - - Current (i) Investments Investments in debt instruments 817.30 - - - (ii) Loans Security deposits 13.07 - - - (iii) Trade receivables 813.89 - - - (iv) Cash and cash equivalents 163.94 - - - (v) Bank balances other than (iv) above 647.43 - - - (vi) Other financial assets 2.62 - - - Sub-Total 2,458.25 - - - Total 3,528.45 - - - Financial liabilities at amortised cost Non-current (i) Borrowings 162.89 - - - (ii) Other financial liabilities 4.66 - - - Total 167.55 - - - Current (i) Borrowings 304.24 - - - (ii) Trade payables 1,482.15 - - - (iii) Other financial liabilities 225.52 - - - Sub-Total 2,011.91 - - - Total 2,179.46 - - - * During the year there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements.Corporate OverviewBoard & Management ReportsFinancial Statements336 337 Dabur India Limited Annual Report 2019-20 B The carrying values and fair values of financial instruments by categories as at 31 March, 2019 are as follows: * Particulars Carrying valueFair value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss ('FVTPL ') Investments in debt instruments - - - - Investments in mutual funds 73.59 73.59 - - Total 73.59 73.59 - - Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVTOCI') Investments in debt instruments 939.61 - 939.61 - Investments in equity instruments 0.07 - - 0.07 Total 939.68 - 939.61 0.07 Financial assets at amortised costNon-current (i) Investments Investments in debt instruments 1,681.38 - - - Investments in joint venture 12.29 - - - (ii) Loans Security deposits 17.56 - - - (iii) Others financial assets 77.66 - - - Total 1,788.89 - - - Current(i) Investments Investments in debt instruments 651.82 - - - (ii) Loans Security deposits 11.04 - - - (iii) Trade receivables 833.56 - - - (iv) Cash and cash equivalents 107.69 - - - (v) Bank balances other than (iv) above 220.47 - - - (vi) Other financial assets 26.47 - - - Sub-Total 1,851.05 - - - Total 3,639.94 - - - Financial liabilities at amortised cost Non-current (i) Borrowings 26.05 - - - (ii) Other financial liabilities 4.56 - - - Total 30.61 - - - Current(i) Borrowings 498.23 - - - (ii) Trade payables 1,455.43 - - - (iii) Other financial liabilities 327.62 - - - Sub-Total 2,281.28 - - - Total 2,311.89 - - - * During the year there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements.
