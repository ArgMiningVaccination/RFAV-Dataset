Haemophilus ||1,398 disease) may cause media, sinusitis, epiglottis and upper respiratory infections. ||Bacterial meningitis; most cases of invasive disease occur in children 3 months to 3 years of age. | |Hepatitis B ||Virus ||8,036 ||Exposure to infected blood or body fluids. In children primarily prenatally spread. ||General flu-like symptoms (may be asymptomatic). Liver may be enlarged, dark urine, light stool, jaundice. Symptoms last 4-6 or droplet. ||Flu-like symptoms, high fever (greater that 101), cough, and conjunctivitis. Rash usually starts on the face and spreads to the body. Kopliks spots in the mouth are bluish with very fine red spots. ||Pneumonia and encephalitis. Persons allergic to eggs may have severe reactions to the vaccine. | |Mumps ||Virus ||338 ||Person-to person contact or droplet. Communicable 6 days before to 9 days after swelling. Most often occurs in children. ||Low-grade fever, headache, earache, pain and swelling of parotid glands (may be unilateral or bilateral). Swelling lasts about a week. ||Infrequent complications are encephalitis and meningitis. Orchitis may occur in males who have reached puberty, but sterility is rare. | |Pertussis ||Gram-negative bacteria ||7,867 ||Person-to person contact or droplet. Very contagious. ||Characteristic cough is nonproductive with quick expiratory phase followed by inspiratory \"whoop.\" Small scleral and conjunctival hemorrhages can occur because of severe coughing. ||Infants younger than 1 year are severely affected. Pneumonia, seizures, and ear infections may occur. | |Pneumococcus ||Gram-positive bacteria ||Not a reportable disease ||Person-to-person, likely by droplet contact; in many persons are colonized in the upper respiratory tract. ||Causes otitis media, sinusitis, ||Virus ||0 ||Direct contact of virus with mouth. ||Low-grade fever and sore throat (most cases are asymptomatic). ||Muscle weakness progressing to paralysis in 0.1-2% of cases. May affect any muscle group including limbs and respiratory muscles. Adults may develop postpolio syndrome 30-40 years after the disease. | |Rubella ||Virus ||176 ||Person-to-person contact or droplet. Communicable 4 days before to 4 days after rash appears. Highly contagious. ||Mild in adults and young children; macular rash on scalp, trunk, and limbs lasting 1-3 days. ||Severe complications in early fetal developmentmay result in congenital malformations and death. Vaccine is live so it must NOT be given to pregnant women. | |Tetanus ||Neurotoxin produced by an anaerobic, Gram-positive bacteria ||35 ||Exposure of wound to the bacterium. Deep-puncture wounds are at greatest risk. Neonatal tetanus results from contamination of the umbilical stump. ||Severe generalized muscle spasms. || | |Varicella ||Virus ||27,382 ||Person-to-person contact or contact with airborne droplets. Very contagious. Communicable 2 days before to 6 days after vesicles appear. Primarily affects children. ||Low-grade fever, listlessness. Lesions appear within 2-4 days. Rash has three phases: raised spots, fluid-filled vesicles, and scabs. Rash itches and is found over entire body. ||Grandparents and older adults should avoid caring for children because they may develop herpes zoster (shingles). | "}
