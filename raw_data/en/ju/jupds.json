Their traditions and healing practices are centred around spirituality, community, environment and self. Balance and respect for nature is at the very core of their belief systems. Traditional Native American healers were elders trained in the healing arts. They used plant-based medicines in order to promote health and wellbeing and their knowledge of sacred and medicinal herbs is second to none. They believe in the power of herbs to heal through herbal medicine and ceremonies and rituals by ridding the body or the environment of negative thoughts, feelings and spirits while improving energy. They also use song, music, dance and community to create powerful healing energy. Native American healers used a wide range of plants and herbs in their healing including; yarrow, sumac, rosemary, mint, wild ginger, lavender and [sage](https://siriusherbal.com/product/salvia-apiana-white-sage/). The term Shaman or Medicine Man is often applied to these healers, who also perform healing ceremonies alongside this herbalism. These include sweat lodges, ceremonial peace pipes, curanderismo and the use of the medicine wheel. Smudging One of the most common Native American ceremonies, and probably the best known, is the smudging ceremony. This involves burning sacred herbs including [sage](https://siriusherbal.com/product/salvia-apiana-white-sage/) to create a fragrant smoke and wafting this smoke over people, belongings or spaces. It is performed regularly, indeed by some Native Americans daily for health and wellness. Smudging is associated with purification and cleansing, as well as giving blessings and stopping illness. Sacred herbs such as sage, cedar, sweetgrass and tobacco can be bundled together with a ribbon and burned, or placed in a bowl and burned to produce cleansing and purifying smoke. The burning of the herbs is usually accompanied by prayers, as the smoke and the prayers are believed to connect us with higher realms; attracting good spirits, while chasing away bad spirits and negative energy. Following this ritual, the space and the people within it have a sense of peace and harmony and illnesses are said to disappear. The importance of sage to the Native Americans Sage is one of the key herbs which are used in smudging and for good reason. According to Healthline's article on the [benefits of burning sage](https://www.healthline.com/health/benefits-of-burning-sage), it has antimicrobial properties, helping to keep infectious bacteria, viruses and fungi at bay.
