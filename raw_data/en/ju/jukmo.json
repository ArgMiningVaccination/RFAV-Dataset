Vaccination is the administration of a vaccine in the human body. It can be given either orally or in injection form. Vaccines boost our immune system by developing immunity against disease-causing pathogens. Vaccines prevent us from many fatal diseases. It also reduces the risk of infection transmission from one person to another. How does the vaccine work? The vaccine consists of weakened, live or inactive forms of a disease-causing virus or micro-organism. After entering our body, vaccine act like a weak disease-causing pathogen, and our body initiate a response against this infection. The infection-like state caused by the vaccine never causes illness, but it activates our [immune system](https://www.narayanahealth.org/blog/how-do-vaccine-work-on-immune-system/) to produce antibodies and T-lymphocytes. Once this imitative infection effect wears off, remaining T and B lymphocytes will fight against future infection. It will take a few weeks for our body to produce these disease-fighting lymphocytes after vaccination. Types of vaccines Vaccines undergo many testing and approval processes before their use on humans. There are many methods are to develop vaccines: - Live attenuated vaccines: These vaccines contain the bacteria or virus that is alive but weakened. Some examples of live attenuated vaccines are: - Rotavirus vaccine - Shingles vaccine - BCG vaccine - MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine - Inactivated or dead vaccine: These contain inactivated or split bacteria or viruses. Some examples are: - Hepatitis A vaccine - Influenza vaccine - Polio vaccine - Rabies vaccine - Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine: These vaccines produce protein to trigger an immune response in our body. These vaccines do not contain live viruses, so the chances of falling ill after vaccination are zero. The mRNA vaccine field is still in the nascent stage. During the recent pandemic, the use of the mRNA vaccine has protected us from a severe COVID-19 infection. - Toxoid vaccines: When some germs enter our body, they produce toxin-like substances that cause diseases in our body. Toxoid vaccines use these toxins in vaccine manufacturing. Some toxoid vaccines are: - Diphtheria - Tetanus - Subunit, recombinant, and conjugate vaccines: These types of vaccines use a specific part of the pathogen (protein, sugar, or capsid). These vaccines give protection against: - Hepatitis B - Whooping cough - HPV - Meningococcal infection - Pneumococcal infection Benefits of vaccination Mostly, vaccines are given to people before they contract any disease. Some of the benefits of vaccines are: - Vaccination may protect us from many life-threatening diseases. - Immunization prevents the spread of diseases from one person to another. - Vaccination may decrease the severity of the disease. Because of various global immunization programs, many epidemic infectious diseases, such as polio and smallpox are eradicated or are nearing eradication. Vaccines for Children: Right from birth to the age of twelve, children are prone to many infections. Recommended vaccines for children are: - Rotavirus - Hepatitis B - Haemophilus influenza type B - Poliovirus - Influenza - MMR combination vaccine (measles, mumps, and rubella) - DPT vaccine (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis) [Hepatitis](https://www.narayanahealth.org/blog/know-all-about-hepatitis/)A - Meningococcal infection - Chickenpox Vaccines for children aged 12-18 years: - DPT booster dose - OPV booster - Encephalitis vaccine - COVID-19 vaccine Vaccination during pregnancy: Vaccination during pregnancy is an effective method to protect the mother and the unborn baby from various infectious diseases. Some vaccines recommended during pregnancy are: - Tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (Tdap) vaccine - Hepatitis B vaccine - Influenza vaccine - Hepatitis A vaccine [HPV vaccine](https://www.narayanahealth.org/blog/hpv-vaccination/) - COVID-19 vaccines Vaccination for adults: Vaccinations in adults prevent many diseases. Some recommended vaccines are: - Influenza shots - Tdap vaccine - HPV vaccine - Hepatitis vaccine Vaccines are very effective in preventing and spreading various diseases. Sometimes we get infected after vaccination, but the disease severity is mild. So without further wait, get your vaccination to keep many diseases at bay.
