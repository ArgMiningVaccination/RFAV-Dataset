It has wreaked havoc through time and been a source of profound comfort and good. Religion majors at Emory represent a wide range of individuals with an equally wide range of interests. Whether you're looking to go into the clergy, medicine, public service, or any number of other careers, developing a deeper understanding of religious traditions and their impact on history, policy, culture, society, and the way we interpret our stories will serve you well.

Mind-Body Science Summer Abroad The Emory-Tibet Science Initiative offers a unique opportunity to combine study of western science and Buddhist philosophies. Spend five weeks with a Buddhist refugee community in India in an environment where Tibetan Buddhist monastics and students inspire and learn from each other. Emory University is the only university in the Western Hemisphere to have such a close partnership with Tibet and His Holiness the Dalai Lama. Religion has really asked me to question the boundaries that we've set up and so readily accept religion as one thing and secularism, politics, and science as another. I'm interested in both diplomacy and human rights and want to be able to work with people of different faiths and cultures. "}
