This is done by following infants born to hepatitis B positive women to ensure they receive the hepatitis B birth dose and hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth, receive the additional hepatitis B vaccine doses to complete the series, and are tested for hepatitis B infection and immunity after they have completed the hepatitis B vaccination series.
