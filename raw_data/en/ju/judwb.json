Acupuncture (Chinese Medicine) and Ayurveda (India) are ancient medicines of Asia. Both medicine are based on a view that all phenomenon are pulsating rhythm called Breath Of Shakti or PranaVayu or ShaktiPrana or Laya or Vak , also called Qi in Daoism and \"Breath of Life\" in CranioSacral work. When the rhythms of prana or qi is imbalanced and we find ourselves ungrounded, unfocused, stressed, overly emotional, \"out of mind\", struggling to sleep or rest, in pain and dis-ease. We can harmonize our prana or Qi using acupuncture, diet, herbs, essential oils, bodywork therapies, meditation, and by cultivating serene stillness in our heart. "}
