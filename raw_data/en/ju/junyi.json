As advocatesfor advanced inquiry and creativity, we greatly prizethe curious and exceptionally competent student. We value this moment to introduce students and others to the intellectual vision of the GraduateSchool and the programs and faculty that embodythat vision. The bulletin's offerings demonstrate thatgraduate schools are the intellectual nerve center ofthe modern university .Graduate schools make groundbreaking discoveries, investigate ideas old andnew, and prepare the next generation of scholars,researchers, thinkers, and teachers. As a matter offact, New York University was a pioneer in graduate education. In 1866, New York Universitybecame the second university in the United States to offer an earned doctorate. In 1886, it for-mally opened a graduate division. Today, the Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS)houses 48 programs that offer doctoral and master's degrees and enrolls over 4,600 studentsannually. The pioneering continues. As we chart the course of our Graduate School for a new century ,we must fuse the strengths of today with a vision of tomorrow's possibilities. To achieve this fusion, GSAS calls on the abun-dant creative ener gies of New York City. Even more important, the Graduate School draws on the extraordinary New York University faculty to work with students to become intellectual leaders\u2014no matter what career they might eventually choose. Graduate education depends first and fore-most on an institution's faculty and students, on the brains that power the school. Buoyed by its city, rooted in its faculty, the Graduate School of Arts and Science shares this bulletin with those who seek a range of graduate degrees, a balance of disciplinary andinterdisciplinary work, and the core values of intellectual communities: rigorous inquiry ,life- long discovery of ideas, and a commitment to the ethics of scholarship.

MacCrackenbelieved that universities shouldrespond to the needs of modernity bygiving unprecedented priority toadvanced research and professional training. Guided by MacCracken's vision, New Y ork University became the second university in America toaward a Ph.D. on the basis of academic performance and examination. In addition to the emphasis on excellence in research, MacCracken recognized the urban environment asboth source and inspiration for aca- demic life. He believed that theUniversity's best interests lay in its interactions with the city. By the early 1900s, the Graduate School had intro-duced courses concerned with majorglobal issues, and the curriculumreflected movement toward progressivevalues. MacCracken's new vision of gradu- ate training attracted ever -growing numbers of young women and men todoctoral programs. The first female graduate students entered theUniversity in 1888. T oday,women constitute over half of the 4,100 mas- ter's and Ph.D. graduate studentsenrolled in 48 departments and pro- grams, as well as in a growing numberofinstitutes and interdisciplinary research areas. Mirroring the cultural diversity of New York City, the Graduate Schoolof Arts and Science is an urban,diverse, and internationally focusedmajor research center, with students from more than 100 countries. The Graduate School still honors the idealexpressed by Albert Gallatin, the University's goal: \"A private university in the publicservice.\"History of the Graduate School 6 HISTORY OF THE GRADUATE SCHOOL Washington Square by Fernand Harvey Lungren (c.1890).

NEW YORK UNIVERSITY AND NEW YORK 78 NEW YORK UNIVERSITY AND NEW YORKAPrivate University Since its founding, New York University has been a private universi- ty. It operates under a board of trusteesand derives its income from tuition,endowment, grants from private foun-dations and government, and giftsfrom friends, alumni, corporations, andother private philanthropic sources. The University is committed to a policy of equal treatment and opportu-nity in every aspect of its relationswith its faculty, students, and staffmembers, without regard to age, citi - zenship status, color, disability, maritalor parental status, national origin,race, religion, sex, sexual orientation,or veteran status.Inquiries regarding the application of the federal laws and regulations concerning affirmative action andantidiscrimination policies and proce-dures at New York University may bereferred to Dr. Sharon Weinberg, ViceProvost for Faculty Affairs, New YorkUniversity ,Elmer Holmes Bobst Library, 70 Washington Square South,New York, NY 10012-1091, 212-998-2370, for faculty and employees,and to Thomas Grace, Director ofJudicial Affairs and T itle IX and VI Officer, Office of the Vice Presidentfor Student Affairs, New Y ork University ,60 W ashington Square South, Suite 601, New York, NY 10012-1019, 212-998-4403, for stu-dents.

New York University is a member of the Association of AmericanUniversities and is accredited by theMiddle States Association of Collegesand Schools (Commission on HigherEducation of the Middle StatesAssociation of Colleges and Schools,3624 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA19104; 215-662-5606). Individualundergraduate, graduate, and profes-sional programs and schools areaccredited by the appropriate special - ized accrediting agencies.New York University is an integral part of the metropolitan community ofNew York City\u2014the business, cultur-al, artistic, and financial center of the nation and the home of the United Nations. The city's extraordinary resources enrich both the academicprograms and the experience of living at New York University. Professors whose extracurricular activities include service as editors for publishing houses and magazines; asadvisers to city government, banks,school systems, and social agencies;and as consultants for museums andindustrial corporations bring to teach-ing an experience of the world and aprofessional sophistication that are dif-ficult to match. Students also, either through course work or in outside activities, tend to beinvolved in the vigorous and varied lifeof the city. Research for term papers inthe humanities and social sciences may take them to such diverse places as theAmerican Museum of Natural History,the Museum of Modern Art, a garment factory, a deteriorating neighborhood, oraforeign consulate. Students in science work with their professors on such problems of imme- diate importance for urban society asthe pollution of waterways and the congestion of city streets. Business majors attend seminars in corporationboardrooms and intern as executiveassistants in business and financialhouses. The schools, courts, hospitals,settlement houses, theatres, play-grounds, and prisons of the greatestcity in the world form a regular part ofthe educational scene for students ofmedicine, dentistry, education, socialwork, law ,business and public admin - istration, and the creative and per- forming arts. The chief center for undergraduate and graduate study is at WashingtonSquare in Greenwich Village, longfamous for its contributions to the fine arts, literature, and drama and its per- sonalized, smaller-scale, European style of living. New York University itselfmakes a significant contribution to the creative activity of the Village throughthe high concentration of faculty and students who reside within a few blocks of the University. University apartment buildings provide housing for nearly 2,000members of the faculty and adminis-tration, and University student resi-dence halls accommodate over 11,500men and women. Many more facultyand students reside in private housingin the area.

It isdesigned to prepare students for advanced work and teaching in American studies. Interdepart-mental by definition, the student's course of study isarranged with the director of the program and the director ofgraduate studies and includesseminars offered in the program and selected courses offered inthe following departments, pro- grams, and institutes: Africana Studies, Anthropology ,Cinema Studies, Comparative Literature,English, Fine Arts, History,Humanities and Social Thought (the Draper Program), Journalism, Music, PerformanceStudies, Philosophy, Politics,and Sociology. The program's committee is made up of faculty from many ofthese departments. The programinterprets \"American\" in a broad sense to include assessments ofthe historical role of the United States in the Americas and, more generally ,in world affairs. Inasmuch as the program has aregional focus, special attentionis given to studies in urbanism and to New York in particular, a global city that comprises manyworld cultures.American StudiesPROGRAM IN FacultyArlene D\u00e1vila, Associate Professor , Anthropology (American Studies).

AMERICAN STUDIES 15285 MERCER STREET, 8TH FLOOR NEW YORK, NY 10003-6653 212-998-8538 TProgram and RequirementsAdmission: Admission to graduate studies in the Program in AmericanStudies is based on academic recordsand letters of recommendation. TheGraduate Record Examination (GRE)is required of all students. The basis of the program is multi- disciplinary; therefore it tends to admit exceptional students who are attuned to working across disciplines. MASTER OF ARTS Course of Study: The terminal M.A. program does not lead directly toPh.D. enrollment, though M.A. stu-dents may apply for Ph.D. study alongwith the general Ph.D. applicant poolin any given year .Atotal of 32 points of course credit\u2014at least 24 taken inresidence at NYU\u2014is required for theM.A. degree. M.A. students mustcomplete the introductory Americanstudies seminar, a research seminar,and three other courses taught by coreprogram faculty ,and they must demonstrate reading proficiency in aforeign language. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY Matriculation: Students may be admit- ted to the Ph.D. program either follow - ing M.A. study at NYU or elsewhere ordirectly after receipt of the bachelor'sdegree. In either case, the first semes- ters of enrollment in the Ph.D. pro- gram must confirm students' readinessfor doctoral work. Thus, students hold-ing the M.A. upon admission mustofficially apply to matriculate for thedoctorate after completing 12 points ofcourse work in American studies atNYU; those entering with only a bachelor' sdegree must do so upon com- pleting 32 points of course work.Approval of matriculation is based onstudents' progress to date and on rec-ommendations from faculty familiarwith their work. Degree Requirements: To qualify for the doctorate, a student must satis-factorily complete graduate studiestotaling at least 72 points, with aminimum of 32 points at the doctorallevel in residence at New York University; pass qualifying examina-tions; and present an acceptable disser-tation. Students who have completedrelevant graduate courses elsewheremay request that such courses be cred-ited to degree requirements within the second semester of study. Credits may be earned through courses, independ- ent study, and group study. Course of Study: All students must take the introductory Seminar inAmerican Studies (G13.3301), GroupResearch Seminar (G13.2319), andIndividual Research Seminar(G13.2306). Beyond this, studentswork with the director of the program,the director of graduate studies, andcommittee advisers to establish theircourse of study; at least 24 points(generally six courses) in addition tothose entailed by the required semi-nars must be earned in courses offeredby the program's core faculty. The program offers a range of six fields: (1) culture, work, and consumption;(2) identity, citizenship, and social for-mation; (3) media, communications, and expressive culture; (4) social and political theory; (5) science, technol- ogy, and society; and (6) urban and community studies. Doctoral students choose to concen- trate their course work in two of these fields and are examined in each. Under special circumstances, fields can beconstructed for students with extraor - dinary interests. If they wish, students may concentrate their work in specificdisciplines, although the chief purposeof the field structure is to encouragetransdisciplinary study. Foreign Language Requirements: Every matriculant must satisfy the doctoral foreign language proficiencyrequirement. This may be done in oneof three ways: (1) demonstrate profi - ciency at an intermediate level in a second foreign language as describedin the Degree Requirements section of this bulletin; (2) demonstrateadvanced proficiency in the same lan-guage offered at the master's level inthe Graduate School foreign language proficiency examination; or (3) in spe-cial cases, complete a yearlong course(with a grade of B or better) in statis-tics, computer methodology, or a tech-nical skill related to the student'sresearch, in addition to demonstrating proficiency in a first foreign language at the master's level. Qualifying Examination: Matriculated students who have completed or arecompleting the appropriate courses andhave already demonstrated knowledgeof the two foreign languages must passthe qualifying examinations. Each can - didate for the Ph.D. must satisfy therequirements set by the faculty com-mittee in two fields. For each field, thecandidate prepares a substantialresearch essay dealing with a widerange of literature in the field, consider-ing questions and topics central to acourse of reading set in consultationwith field examiners. An oral sessionmay be conducted after the work iscomplete. Dissertation: When the student has completed at least one year in resi - dence and all course and language requirements, passed the qualifyingexaminations, proposed an acceptablesubject for the dissertation, and been recommended by the program, he or she is formally admitted to candidacy for the doctorate, and an advisory committee is appointed. While mostcommittees are comprised of membersfrom the Program Committee, stu-dents are permitted to work with any appropriate member of the NYU fac- ulty. Approval of the dissertation bythe committee and a defense of thedissertation examination complete therequirements for the degree.

Myers DIRECTOR OF GRADUATE STUDIES: Associate Professor Susan Carol Rogers nthropologists are concerned with every aspect of human life, past and present. This view makes anthropology a complex disci-pline, its theories and methodstranscending the usual bound - aries of natural science, social science, and the humanities. Cultural anthropologists in the department share a belief thatstudy and research must be firmly grounded in rigorous training in general social and cul- tural theory ,both in contempo - rary writings and in the classics ofanthropology and sociology .The faculty also believe that basic ethnography remains the corner- stone on which all cultural anthropology rests and are con-cerned with the representation of anthropological knowledge in writing and film. There is a com-mitment to an understanding of complex societies that is informed by a comparative perspective andknowledge of small-scale soci- eties. Recent field research by fac - ulty and students has been conducted in Africa, Australia, Oceania, East Asia, India, theMiddle East, Europe, South America, the Caribbean, Mexico, and the United States. Facultyinterests converge around genderrelations; personhood; religion and belief nationalism; institutions in complex societies; trans-national processes; science andhealth; and urban life. Much fac - ulty research focuses on the medi-ation of identities throughpopular and public culturalforms\u2014such as art, television, indigenous media, urban space, regional cultures, and ideologiesof language use\u2014in a variety ofchanging social contexts. Linguistic anthropology focuses on how language is used to create and maintain the social relations and symbolic systemsthat constitute everyday life. Students are encouraged to carry out ethnographic studies of lan - guage use in communities and institutions both within and outside New York City. Archaeologists in the depart- ment are committed to the belief that the material remains ofancient societies provide signifi- cant insights into the dynamics of sociocultural evolution. Thedepartment has developed an archaeology program that focuses on key transformations in cul-tural evolution; the origins of art and symbolism; archaeology and gender; the emergence of foodproduction; class inequality and urbanism; and the development and collapse of chieftaincies andearly states. A diversity of theo- retical perspectives, includingcultural ecology, political econ- omy, and symbolic archaeology, are represented and encouraged.The geographic scope of faculty research includes the Near East,Egypt, South Asia, Europe, andNorth America. The biological anthropologists in the department are involvedin research on primate socioecol - ogy, comparative primate mor- phology ,molecular anthropology, paleoanthropology ,primate pale - ontology, and skeletal morphol- ogy. In addition to these specialist areas, faculty research is unified by a conceptual and intellectual foundation in genet - ics, evolutionary theory ,ecology , and behavior. These are core themes in a common enterprise that can be referred to as evolu- tionary primatology\u2014 the study of human beings and other pri - mates within an evolutionary context. Faculty research is based on a solid foundation of tradi- tional approaches and concepts inphysical anthropology, an appre- ciation of the multidisciplinarity of the subdiscipline, and techni - cal and theoretical proficiency in newly emer ging specialty areas. The research and training pro- gram in our department is dis- tinguished by its unique commitment to integrating laboratory-based and field-based research. We have state-of-the-art laboratories in population geneticsRUFUS D.

The fac-ulty's research takes them andtheir students to primatological and paleoanthropological fieldsites in Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Venezuela, Bolivia, Greece,Gabon, Cameroon, Zambia,Tanzania, Ethiopia, Malaysia, Indonesia, and China. The department is committed to comparative research that seekstheories allowing for the enor-mous diversity in human life. The program offers a holisticapproach to the study of humans and exposes students to the tradi-tional subdisciplines while ensur-ing that they also receive inten- sive training in particular prob-lems within one subfield.Students are encouraged toexplore the related fields of bio-logical sciences, earth sciences, ancient and contemporary lan-guages, film, history, and the humanities to enrich their under-standing of particular problems.

The department offers the Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degrees with specialization in various subdisci-plines. The department offers one stand-alone M.A. program in biologi-cal anthropology (track in human skeletal biology). In all other cases, the M.A. is awarded as a step in fulfill-ment of requirements for the Ph.D.Applicants should apply directly tothe Ph.D. program. They will be for-mally admitted to the Ph.D. program,however, only after the requirements outlined below have been fulfilled. MASTER OF ARTS Atotal of 36 points of course work is required for the M.A. degree, 12 ofthese being in the core courses. Allstudents in each of the subdisciplinesare required to take certain depart-mental core courses. It is recognized,however, that even at the master'slevel, students usually have definedtheir subdisciplines of interest. Hence,each student follows within a subdisci - pline a structured program to assurecompetence in anthropology by thetime the M.A. degree is completed.The requirements for each of the sub - disciplines are described below . Human Skeletal Biology: All students must take the following courses or theirapproved equivalents: (1) DepartmentalSeminar (G14.1000) or Ph.D. (3) Interpreting Human Skeletal Morphology (G14.1520); and (4) Biological Variation Among HumanPopulations (G14.1517) or HumanGenetics and Biology (G14.339X). Inaddition, students must take at leastone field training or internship course. Biological Anthropology: All stu - dents in the Ph.D. program must take(1) Departmental Seminar (G14.1000)or an alternative course approved bythe director of graduate studies andtheir M.A. advisory committee; (2) allthree of the New (3) II(G14.3218) or an equivalent seminarapproved by their M.A. advisory committee. Archaeological Anthropology: All students must take (1) DepartmentalSeminar (G14.1000) or an alternativecourse approved by the director ofgraduate and their M.A. advi- sory committee, Anthropological Archaeology (G14.1020), and Biological Anthropology (G14.1030) as their core courses (in semesters when G14.1030 is not offered, students should consult the director of graduatestudies or their M.A. advisory commit- tee); (2) either History of Anthropology(G14.1636) or a course in the history of archaeology; (3) one archaeology course focusing on a specific geographicregion; (4) one course in archaeologicalmethods; and (5) a supervised field tripexperience approved by their M.A.advisory committee. Cultural and Linguistic Anthropo- logy: All students must take (1) Departmental Seminar (G14.1000) or an alternative course approved by the director of graduate studies and their M.A. advisory committee, SocialAnthropology Theory and Practice(G14.1010), and Linguistic Anthropo-logy (G14.1040) as their core courses; (2) an Ethnographic Traditions course, chosen in consultation with their M.A.advisory committee; and (3) History ofAnthropology (G14.1636). On entering the M.A. program, each student is assigned an advisory com-mittee consisting of three facultymembers who meet with the studentonce each semester to plan the stu-dent's course work for the following semester. The department evaluates all M.A. graduate courses taken at otheruniversities, and credit may be trans - ferred within the limits set by the Graduate School of Arts and Science. No later than the middle of the term in which all M.A. course work has been completed, usually the thirdsemester of full-time course work, thestudent selects an M.A. paper commit - tee, consisting of a supervisor and areader ,from among the faculty. The topic of the paper is selected in consul - tation with the M.A. paper commit - tee, and this committee must approve the M.A. paper before the master'sdegree is awarded. Note: Students in the master' sprogram may take no more than 8 points in research or read - ing courses. During the second year of graduate study ,students petition to enter the Ph.D. program, as described below. No student may register for more than12 points beyond the M.A. until themaster' spaper has been accepted and she or he has provisional entry to thedoctoral program.DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY There are two ways to apply for admis- sion into the Ph.D. program. Studentswho already have a master's degree inanthropology apply for admissiondirectly through the Graduate Schoolof Arts and Science. Students enrolledin the M.A. program petition for entryinto the Ph.D. program at the begin-ning of the fourth semester in resi-dence. To petition, a student mustdevelop a program of study that hasbeen approved by his or her Ph.D.committee, consisting of three facultymembers in the department who for- mally agree to supervise the student's research. The head of the Ph.D. com-mittee is the student's main disserta-tion adviser. A successful petition consists of a written statement indicat- ing a plan of study and research, for-mulated in consultation with theproposed Ph.D. committee and thenapproved by the entire departmentalfaculty. Final acceptance is conditionalupon successful completion of themaster' scourse work and master' s paper. These course points are then applied toward the Ph.D., whichrequires a total of 72 points. Studentswho have been formally admitted tothe Ph.D. program may take a maxi-mum of 24 points in research courses. On completion of 64 points or more of course work, a student must takethe written Ph.D. comprehensiveexaminations. These examinationscover work in three areas of specializa-tion. The Ph.D. committee may alsoset other course requirements, depend - ing on the particular needs of the stu-dent. The language requirement mustbe fulfilled as well as an oral defense ofthe dissertation proposal. Once theserequirements are completed, the stu-dent has achieved Ph.D. candidacy andmay pursue dissertation research. Atthis time, the student files for the degree of M.Phil. After completion of the dissertation, the student defendsthe dissertation at a final oral examina-tion conducted by members of thePh.D. committee and two additionalscholars. Three members of the exam - ining committee must be from theanthropology faculty . LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS The department requires that all stu- dents in the Ph.D. program demon-strate proficiency in one foreignlanguage. The language is usually cho-sen from Arabic, Chinese, French,German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese,Russian, or Spanish. Petitions to take26 ANTHROPOLOGYother languages should be made to the director of graduate studies. Students at the master's level are not required to demonstrate compe-tence in a foreign language, but thedepartment recommends that suchcompetence be developed. URBAN ANTHROPOLOGY The special area of study in urban anthropology is open to students in the departmental curriculum but has no specific requirements. It emphasizesapplication of anthropological method-ology to the problems of urban societyin the United States and abroad. NewYork City provides excellent trainingconditions for studies of urban life, aswell as access to urban institutions andagencies at the local, state, national,and international levels. CERTIFICATE PROGRAM IN CULTURE AND MEDIA (See the Certificate Program in Culture and Media section of this bulletin for further information.) The Departments of Anthropology and Cinema Studies offer a joint course ofstudy, integrated with Ph.D. work ineither of those departments, leading tothe Advanced Certificate in Cultureand Media. Core faculty are ProfessorFaye Ginsburg, director of theProgram in Culture and Media;Assistant Professors T ejaswini Ganti and Jeff Himpele of the Department ofAnthropology; and Professor Robert P . Stam of the Department of CinemaStudies. The certificate program provides a focused course of graduate studies inte-grating production with theory andresearch. Training in this program willenable students to pursue the following: 1. Production of work in 16 mm film and state-of-the-art digital video based on their own research, resulting in a half-hour documentary. 2. Ethnographic research into the uses and meanings of media in a range ofcommunities and cultures. Studentsfrom the program have been doingPh.D. research on the development ofmedia in diverse settings, from theemergence of media in Papua New Guinea, to circulation of religious mediain northern Nigeria, to the use of mediain linking the Tibetan diaspora. 3. Teaching the history ,theory ,and production of ethnographic documen- tary and related issues in cinema andmedia studies.4. A career in media requiring an understanding of anthropology, such asspecialized programming and distribu-tion of ethnographic film and video,community-based documentary pro-duction, management of ethnographicfilm/video libraries and archives, orwork in new media. The program's philosophy takes a broad approach to the relationships betweenculture and media in a number ofdomains including a critical approach toethnographic film's significance for thefields of anthropology and cinema/media studies; problems in representa-tion of cultures through media; thedevelopment of media in indigenous,diaspora, and non-Western communi-ties; the emerging social and culturalformations shaped by new media prac-tices; and the political economy shapingthe production, distribution, and con-sumption of media worldwide. Curriculum: The program requires approximately one additional semesterbeyond the M.A. degree and consists of an original project and eight courses, two of which may be counted towardthe M.A. degree, two toward the Ph.D.Courses include seminars that criticallyaddress the history and theory of ethnographic film and issues in culture and media, production courses in filmand/or video in the film school, culturetheory and the documentary, and elec-tives on topics such as Third Worldcinema and feminist film criticism.Students may not take courses in theculture and media program unless theyare pursuing an M.A. or a Ph.D. incinema studies or a Ph.D. in anthro-pology at NYU. Students with priortraining in media may be able to sub-stitute other courses from the extensivecurriculum offered in cinema studies,anthropology, or media production\u2014including other forms such as photog - raphy and new media. Internships: The program also arranges supervised internships forcourse credit, tailored to individualresearch and professional interests.Students work in a variety of program-ming and production positions forinstitutions such as the Margaret MeadFilm Festival, the Museum of theAmerican Indian, the Asia Society, andthe Jewish Museum. The program works closely with the Center for Media, Culture, andHistory (see below).MASTER'S PROGRAM IN HUMAN SKELETAL BIOLOGY This program prepares graduates to apply the principles and techniques of skeletal biology and genetic research inphysical anthropology to a variety of contexts, including those in the foren-sic sciences (e.g., medical examiner'soffice, coroner's office, armed forces,criminal justice, law enforcement, mass disasters). The program can also beuseful training for students who are preparing for admission to doctoralprograms in skeletal biology and human evolution. Prospective students should hold a B.A. or B.S., preferably with an emphasis in anthropology, biology ,or the natural sciences. An integral part of the program is hands-on, semester-long professionalinternships developed according tostudent interest. These opportunitiesrange from those in genetics (depart-mental labs and the medical exam-iner's office), osteology and odontology(departmental labs, NYU College ofDentistry, the American Museum ofNatural History, and the medicalexaminer's office), and field recoverytraining (departmental or other fieldschools). Ideally, student research proj-ects evolve from these internships intoM.A. theses. Yearly skeletal biologycolloquia bring visiting scientists fortalks and workshops. THE NYCEP PROGRAM New York University participates in the New Y ork Consortium for Evolutionary Primatology (NYCEP), a graduate training program in evolutionary prima-tology that includes City University ofNew York, Columbia University, theWildlife Conservation Society at theBronx Zoo, and the American Museumof Natural History. The consortium pro-vides an integrated training programthat allows students to take courses,seminars, and internships at any of theseinstitutions given by more than 40physical anthropologists, primatologists,and vertebrate paleontologists partici-pating in the program. In addition to the departmental requirements, students in biological anthropology must take three NYCEP core courses. These are the founda-tional courses Primate Behavior,Ecology, and Conservation;Evolutionary Morphology; andGenetics and Evolutionary Theory . Students also gain practical experiencethrough required internships, wherethey work individually on research projects with NYCEP faculty. MostANTHROPOLOGY 27students are provided the opportunity to travel abroad during the summer toconduct research at active field sites. JOINT PH.D. PROGRAM IN ANTHROPOLOGY AND FRENCH STUDIES The Department of Anthropology and the Institute of French Studies offer ajoint Ph.D. degree for students inter-ested in the anthropology of France.The degree prepares a student for teaching and research as a Europeanist in departments of anthropology or as a civilization specialist in departmentsof French. Students must be admitted to both the Department of Anthropology andthe Institute of French Studies. Fluency in French is required. Students nor- mally begin by completing the M.A. in French studies and petitioning for admission into the Ph.D. program inanthropology in the fall of the secondyear in residence. A total of 72 pointsis required for the joint degree, with atleast 36 points in anthropology,including courses cross-listed betweenthe department and the Institute.Course requirements include a two-course sequence in 19th- and 20th-cen-tury French history, two additionalcore courses in French studies, the corecourses in social anthropology and lin-guistic anthropology, History ofAnthropology (G14.1636), one non-Western area anthropology course, and three theory and methods courses in anthropology .Formal exchange agree- ments with the Ecole des Hautes Etudes and the Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, Paris, per- mit students to take some of their course work in France during the thirdyear of study. See the Institute of French Studies section of this bulletin for fur- ther details. ANTHROPOLOGY WITH A FOCUS IN NEAR EASTERN STUDIES The Department of Anthropology offers Ph.D. candidates a special area of study with a focus in Near Eastern studies. This emphasis enables anthro-pologists to acquire systematic train - ing in a Near Eastern language as wellas knowledge of the literature, history , and civilization of the Near East. It isintended for both sociocultural anthro-pologists and archaeologists. Requirements include the M.A. core courses in anthropology, one course inNear Eastern archaeology ,two courses in the anthropology of the Near East,and four courses in the Near Eastern field chosen outside the Department ofAnthropology (usually in the history,literature, and civilization of the NearEast). Language competence in bothwritten and spoken versions of one of the area languages is also required. CENTER FOR LATIN AMERICAN AND CARIBBEAN STUDIES The Department of Anthropology is actively connected with the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CLACS) of the Graduate School of Artsand Science. CLACS brings together University faculty specializing in Latin American and Caribbean research.Anthropology faculty members offer courses and guidance to students in this program, and anthropology students may construct special programs of study and research that utilize theresources offered by CLACS. TheCenter forms a consortium with theInstitute for Latin American Studies atColumbia University that sponsorsjoint courses and conferences that NewYork University students may attend. KING JUAN CARLOS I CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF SPAINAND THE SPANISH-SPEAKINGWORLD Department faculty maintain ties to this preeminent center for interdisci - plinary Spanish studies.

This seminar situatesethnographic film within the wider project of the representation of cultural lives, and especially of \"natives.\"Starting with what are regarded as thefirst examples of the genre, the courseexamines how these emerged in a par-ticular intellectual context and politicaleconomy. It then considers the keyworks that have defined the genre, andthe epistemological and formal innova-tions associated with them, addressingquestions concerning social theory ,doc- umentary ,as well as the institutional structures through which they are funded, distributed, and seen by vari-ous audiences. Throughout, the coursekeeps in mind the properties of film asasignifying practice, its status as a form of anthropological knowledge,and the ethical and political concernsraised by cross-cultural representation.Culture and Media II: Ethnography of Media G14.1216 Open only to grad- uate students in the Departments ofAnthropology, Cinema Studies, andPerformance Studies. Prerequisite: G14.1215. Ginsburg, Himpele. 4 points. Inthe last decade, a new field\u2014the ethnography of media\u2014has emerged asan exciting new arena of research.While claims about media in people'slives are made on a daily basis, surpris- ingly little research has actually attempted to look at how media is partof the naturally occurring lived reali-ties of people's lives. In the last decade,anthropologists and media scholarsinterested in film, television, and videohave been turning their attentionincreasingly beyond the text and the empiricist notions of audiences(stereotypically associated with theethnography of media), to consider,ethnographically ,the complex social worlds in which media is produced, circulated, and consumed, at home andelsewhere. This work theorizes mediastudies from the point of view of cross-cultural ethnographic realities and anthropology from the perspective of new spaces of communication focusingon the social, economic, and political life of media and how it makes a dif- ference in the daily lives of people as apractice, whether in production, recep-tion, or circulation.

The mis - sion of the Center is to bridge thegap between the theoreticaladvances in those branches of applied mathematics relevant togeophysical flows and the under- standing of phenomena observedin the climate system. The research expertise within theCourant Institute that is directly relevant to the kinds of problemsaddressed within atmospheric andoceanic sciences includes partial differential equations, numericalanalysis, turbulence, fluid dynam - ics, dynamical systems and chaos,statistical mechanics, adaptive meshes, visualization, and data mining. Associated and core fac-ulty in CAOS are active members of the international science com-munity in all of the scientific dis- ciplines intersecting with of the Center, including dynamical meteorology, physicaloceanography, and climatedynamics. The placement of the Center within the Courant envi-ronment, and the diverse con - stituent faculty of the Centeritself, creates the potential for important advances in the climate sciences.251 MERCER STREET NEW YORK, NY 10012-1185 212-998-3231 WEB SITE: TATMOSPHERE OCEAN SCIENCE 37Program and OF PHILOSOPHY Ph.D. candidates are expected to be full-time students.

The curriculum includes a broad base of course work in cellular and molecular biology togetherwith specialty classes in concepts and techniques of structural biology.During their first year, students per- form research rotations with faculty at NYU or at an NIH campus. The latterusually is an option during the sum- mers. After exploring all the thesis research options available, students select a faculty research supervisor at either the NIH or NYU. Depending on the thesis research area, studentsmay perform research at either or bothinstitutions and have an advisory com-mittee composed of both NIH andNYU faculty .After meeting all requirements, students receive theirPh.D. degree from New YorkUniversity. NYU Program Program (Medical Scientist Training Program, orMSTP): This program provides a select group of aspiring medical scien-tists not only with the broad biomed-ical and clinical insights of a physician but also with the rigorous research training in a specific discipline that ischaracteristic of a Ph.D. degree pro-gram in basic science. M.D.-Ph.D. students are simultane- ously registered in the School ofMedicine and the Graduate School ofArts and Science (GSAS) of New YorkUniversity. They must meet all therequirements for the Ph.D. degree inGSAS and for the M.D. degree in theSchool of Medicine. The program allowsalimited number of students the oppor- tunity to pursue a combined degree inmedicine and the social sciences. In a typical program, the first 18 to 24 months are devoted to a preclinicalbasic sciences curriculum similar tothat pursued by candidates for theBASIC MEDICAL SCIENCES 41M.D. degree. The student then enters a graduate program in which he or she takes advanced graduate courses andpursues a research project. M.D.-Ph.D. students usually take their qualifyingexaminations at the end of the third year or the beginning of their fourth year. Following the completion of stud- ies toward the Ph.D. degree, the stu-dent takes an accelerated special clinical program and completes the remainingrequirements for the M.D. degree in 13to 18 months. Completion of therequirements for the M.D.-Ph.D. usu-ally takes six to seven years. All M.D.-Ph.D. candidates receive full financial support, which includestuition, fees, and an annual stipend ($26,000 for 2005-2006). Admission to the M.D.-Ph.D. program is highlycompetitive, and the selection commit- tee pays special attention to the research experience of the candidateand to the quality of his or her scien-tific preparation. A description of thecandidate's research experience and let-ters of recommendation from allresearch supervisors are essential com -ponents of the M.D.-Ph.D. application. Toapply for admission to the pro- gram, applicants must 1. Complete the online AMCAS appli- cation at www.aamc.org/students/amcas and indicate that they are applying to the M.D.-Ph.D. program at NYU.The deadline is October 15, 2005. 2.

Biotic Resources Integrating Development, Genetics,Evolution, and Systematics (BRIDGES) is a specializedtraining track in molecular evolution. Students in thistrack are trained to use molecu - lar approaches to understandthe evolution and diversity ofplants and animal species and aspects related to the conserva-tion and curation of thesebiotic resources. The BRIDGEStrack was developed jointly byfaculty at New York Universityand its affiliated institutions,the New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) and theAmerican Museum of Natural History (AMNH), which curateand study large collections ofplant and animal species. The Developmental Genetics (DG) track offers students a cur- riculum focused on the use of genetic approaches to under- stand developmental mecha-nisms. Students conduct research with investigatorsworking in a variety of genetic systems, including Drosophila, C. elegans, Xenopus, Arabidopsis, mouse, chicken, and zebrafish, and studying diverse develop-mental processes, such as pat- tern formation, cell determina-tion, cell lineage, and cell-cellinteractions. This track bringstogether investigators from theDepartment of Biology and theNew York University School ofMedicine to provide a compre- hensive program focused indevelopmental genetics. The graduate program in basic sciences (College ofDentistry) is part of the gradu-ate program of the Departmentof Biology, Graduate School of Arts and Science, and focuses on oral biology.

Admission: In addition to the general Graduate School of Arts and Sciencerequirements for admission, applicantsare expected to have an average of B orbetter in the sciences and to have com-pleted the equivalent of an undergrad-uate major in biology .Admission to graduate study is based on academic records, recommendations, assessmentsof the applicant's scientific potential,and scores on the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). The GRE general test is required of all applicants to theM.S. and Ph.D. programs. Theadvanced GRE test in biology is rec-ommended of all applicants to thePh.D. program. Consideration is givento applicants with an under graduate major other than biology; remedial work to make up any undergraduatedeficiencies may be taken prior to, orconcurrent with, the master' sprogram but must be completed within the first year in the Ph.D. program. Applications for graduate study are accepted on a continuing basis. M.S.students may begin study in the fall,spring, or summer semester; however,Ph.D. students may start only in thefall semester. All students with international cre - dentials whose native language is notEnglish should refer to the Admission to Degree Programs section of this bulletin regarding the required Test of Englishas a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Insome cases, prior to taking graduatecourses, students may be required toenroll in noncredit English courses attheir own expense. In special cases, a student may be accepted as a nonmatriculant. A non-degree student may take up to 12points in the Department of Biology before applying for matriculated statusin the M.S. or Ph.D. program. Theapplication for matriculation is onlyconsidered if the student has received aBor better in each course included in the 12 points. Deadlines for applyingfor nonmatriculant status are the sameas for the M.S. program. Seminars: All faculty and doctoral students attend the weekly departmen- tal seminar ,at which scholars from other institutions discuss their researchfindings. In addition, the departmentsponsors special topical seminarsthroughout the year. Special Notes: Although master's stu- dents may start their program in anysemester, some courses are full-yearcourses and must be started in the fall.

Qualifying Examination/Admission to Candidacy: The written Ph.D. qualifying examination (preliminaryexamination) is generally taken at theend of the first year of full-time study,that is, in the spring semester of a stu-dent' sfirst year .The examination con - sists of two parts. The first part is an independent and original research pro-posal on a topic related to the themeof the spring seminar series. The pro-posal is submitted to an examination committee consisting of three facultymembers. The proposal may not be inthe area of the student's thesisresearch. The second part is an oralexamination before the examinationcommittee, which is intended to testfurther the student's understanding ofthe topics contained in the writtenproposal. Satisfactory completion ofthe qualifying examination constitutesadmission to Ph.D. candidacy. By the end of the spring semester, the student must secure a facultysponsor and a research advisory com-mittee of at least three faculty mem-bers from within the department whohave formally agreed to supervise thedissertation research. A dissertation proposal for the completion of original biological research must be filed andapproved by the sponsor (generally during the semester following success - ful completion of the written qualify - ing examination). The student mustthen pass an oral examination on theresearch proposal before the student' s examining committee. Doctoral Dissertation: The plan of study and the dissertation research areformulated in consultation with thefaculty sponsor and the research advi-sory committee. The dissertation mustrepresent original, independentresearch in a significant area of biologyat a level comparable to research pub-lished in recognized journals or as pro-fessional monographs. When thedissertation is completed and has beenapproved by the sponsor and by theresearch advisory committee, the can - didate defends the results of theresearch before a faculty committeeand invited outside examiners with expertise in the field of research. No less than six months may lapsebetween the oral proposal examinationand the dissertation defense.

The Graduate RecordExamination (GRE) scores from thegeneral test and the advanced chem-istry (or other appropriate advanced-level area) test are required. Students whose native language is not English must submit the scorefrom either the Test of Spoken English(TSE) or the Test of English as aCHEMISTRY 69Foreign Language (TOEFL). Students beginning graduate study are usually accepted only for September admission. Part-time candidates for the M.S. degree are accepted only if they areable to attend classes in the daytime,since very few courses are offered inthe evening. MASTER OF SCIENCE Requirements: Students must satisfac- torily complete 32 points (at least 24 in residence at New York University) withaGPA of B (3.0) or better, and one of the following alternatives: (1) presenta-tion of a seminar on an advanced topicin the major field; (2) preparation of aninterpretative review of the literature ofaselected area of chemistry; (3) prepara- tion of a dissertation based on originalresearch; (4) passing an oral examina - tion in the major field. The suggested courses in each field are PHILOSOPHY The Doctor of Philosophy is a research degree. It signifies that the recipientis able to conduct independentresearch and has both a broad basicknowledge of all areas of chemistryand a comprehensive knowledge ofone field in particular. Since graduate students arrive with avariety of backgrounds, many with M.S. degrees from other institutions inthe United States and abroad, the pro-gram of courses for each student isdesigned in consultation with thedirector of graduate studies, takingeach student's specific background,experience, and interests into account. While there are no specific course requirements for the Ph.D. in chem-istry, students in the Ph.D. programmay choose to participate in one of thefollowing three tracks. Each track rep - resents an area of study reflecting both the current research foci of the faculty and the evolving interests of studentsand is designed to provide a morestructured academic experience. Each track provides a guideline for 24 of the72points required for the degree. These tracks may also be modified inconsultation with the adviser and thedirector of graduate studies to betterfit the individual needs of students. Note: Except where noted, each of the following courses carries 4 points. Organic/Bioorganic Chemistry Track: Organic Reactions (G25.1311) Structure and Theory in OrganicChemistry (G25.1313)Organic Analysis (G25.1326) and 12 points selected from the following: Special Topics in Organic Chemistry (G25.2261, 2262)Organic Photochemistry (G25.2281)Bioorganic Chemistry (G25.2884)Strategies in Synthetic Reaction Mechanisms 2 Chemistry(G25.2626)Chemical (G25.2680), 2points Applied Infrared Spectroscopy(G25.2690), 2 points Students must satisfactorily complete at least 72 points derived from coursesand research, at least 32 of which mustbe taken in residence at New YorkUniversity. Students usually gain labo-ratory research experience in one ormore groups during their first year.This laboratory experience providesstudents with direct exposure to tech-niques and methodology used in the various labs and helps them to choose athesis adviser . In order to gain matriculation into the Ph.D. program in chemistry ,astu- dent must pass the Ph.D. qualifyingexamination at the beginning of the spring semester of their second year.The exam is designed to ensure that students are ready to embark on seri-ous research and scholarship. It con-sists of a written report (5-10 pages)and an oral examination before theirdivisional faculty. If performance is notsatisfactory, one more attempt isallowed at the end of the second year.Students who pass are graduated to thestatus of a Ph.D. candidate. The Ph.D. program in chemistry requires two additional oral/written examinations. At the end of the third year of graduate study, students arerequired to pass a research progress examination, in which students give a 30-minute presentation on theirresearch to date before their thesisadvisory committee. At the beginningof the fourth year of graduate study, awritten and oral original research pro - posal examination must be passed. Theexam tests student skills in scientificwriting, reasoning analysis, integrationof scientific concepts, interpretation of data in the literature, and creativity in the design of new experiments.Feedback on student abstracts submit-ted prior to the exam is intended to help students identify promising research directions. The final writtenproposal (10-12 pages) and oral exami-nation are evaluated by an appointedcommittee. A passing grade must beachieved at least nine months beforethe thesis defense. The thesis defense,performed before the thesis advisorycommittee, is the last step of thePh.D. program. All doctoral candidates are expected to participate in the seminar programoffered by their division and to attendthe departmental colloquia presentedby distinguished visiting scientists. Doctoral Dissertation: The heart of the doctoral program is the researchleading to the preparation of the dis-sertation. The accumulation of highgrades in formal courses, while impor - tant, is secondary to the demonstrationof a capacity for original thinking andthe completion of an investigation thatcontributes significantly to chemicalknowledge. When a student is for-mally admitted to matriculation forthe doctorate, a committee consistingof the research adviser and two otherfaculty members is selected to advise the candidate and monitor the progress of the research by meetingwith the student at scheduled intervalsand whenever requested by the stu-dent. When the dissertation is com-pleted, it is read by the researchcommittee and two additional faculty. Up to two outside readers who areexperts in the field of the dissertation research may be appointed as disserta- tion readers. A public oral defense of the approved dissertation is then held.DEPARTMENTAL FELLOW- SHIPS, PRIZES, AND AWARDS Acomprehensive list of University, Graduate School, and departmentalfellowships, prizes, and awards appearsinthe Financing Graduate Education section of the GSAS Application for Admission and Financial Aid. 70 CHEMISTRYCoursesMost courses are lecture oriented; oth- ers emphasize individual study with attention to the needs of each student.

The approach to cinema is interdisci - plinary and international inscope and is concerned withunderstanding motion pictures in terms of the material prac- tices that produce them and within which they circulate. While film constitutes the pri - mary object of study, the depart-ment also considers other media that fall within the realm ofsound/image studies (e.g.,broadcast television, video art,and online technologies) to bewithin its purview. Three graduate programs are offered in the department: the M.A. Program in Cinema Studies, the M.A. Program in Moving Image Archiving and Preservation, and the Ph.D. Program in Cinema Studies. Graduate students may take a production course only in the summer through the Department of Film and Television. Studentsenrolled in the Certificate Programin Culture and Media are requiredto take further production coursesduring the academic year.Most courses in cinema stud- ies include extensive filmscreenings that are supple-mented by a weekly cinemath-eque. Students also have accessto extensive film and film- related resources in the depart- ment's George Amberg Study Center. In addition, the Elmer Holmes Bobst Library houses a substantial video collection that is located in the A very Fisher Center for Music and Media.Other New York City institu-tions such as the Museum of Modern Art, the Library of the Performing Arts at LincolnCenter ,and the Anthology Film Archives offer further invaluableresources for the film student.721 BROADWAY , 6TH FLOOR NEW YORK, NY 10003-6807 212-998-1600 T FacultyRichard Allen, Associate Professor.

Students also have the opportu-nity to pursue internships for credit atfilm libraries and archives in the city orin the film and media industries inorder to further their professionaldevelopment. Many lecture classes areoffered in the evening for the conven - ience of working students. Graduates of the program have gone on to suc-cessful careers as film curators, pro - grammers, preservationists, critics, andeducators as well as filmmakers, screen - writers, and industry professionals. The M.A. Program in Moving Image Archiving and Preservation is atwo-year course of study that providesmoving image archivists with an inter - national, comprehensive education in the theories, methods, and practices ofmoving image archiving and preserva-tion and includes, in addition to film,the study of video, broadcast television,and digital media. The curriculum covers all aspects of moving imagearchiving, including film history/histo - riography and film style; conservation, studies;use of new digital technologies; and access to archival holdings. This pro- gram takes full advantage of the NewYork City area resources. Studentswork with archives, museums,libraries, labs, and arts organizations.They do internships and practicumswith New York City organizations dur-ing two academic years and with repos- itories either in New York or elsewhere during the intervening summer. They also have the opportunity to engage with other programs at New YorkUniversity, such as the Program inMuseum Studies, the paper -based archives program in the Department ofHistory, and the conservation programof the Institute of Fine Arts. Althoughthe program trains students to dealwith all types of moving image mate - rial in all settings, it also pays atten- tion to problems posed by works thathave no institutional stewardship(orphan, independent, avant-garde,documentary ,noninstitutional Web sites, etc.). The program also addressesthe ties between the practices of mov-ing image archiving and the practicesof scholarly research. The Ph.D. Program in Cinema Studies prepares students to developteaching competence and to pursueresearch in cinema and media studies.The curriculum draws on the methodsof a number of disciplines, includingart history, cultural studies, Americanstudies, psychoanalytic theory, andphilosophy and involves intensive sem - inar-level study in film theory, history, and research methods. Graduates ofthe program have gone onto positionsof academic leadership in the field.

Thoughthe student may specialize in one par-ticular department/task within theinstitution, over the course of thesummer they are expected to obtain abroad knowledge of how the variousdepartments of that institution worktogether. Work done during theinternship experience may serve as thecore research and preparation for thefinal thesis project. Students areencouraged to engage in this intern-ship outside the United States to view how repositories operate differently in different countries. Thesis or Portfolio: Each student is required to complete a capstone projectin the form of either a well-developedthesis or a portfolio. The student is expected to work with their adviser beginning in their second semester to make sure that their capstone projectreflects their learning experience in the program. The portfolio must include awritten essay synthesizing the wide variety of topics learned during the program as well as good examples of projects that the student has com-pleted. The portfolio may serve as anexample of what the student might present to a potential employer. The portfolio must be turned in by the10th week of the student's final springsemester, and at the end of that semes- ter the student must orally present thisportfolio to a committee of faculty and working professionals who evaluate whether or not the student is ready tobe granted the degree. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY PRO- GRAM IN CINEMA STUDIES The Doctor of Philosophy degree is conferred for advanced studies inwhich the student demonstrates out-standing original scholarship. It signi - fies the student can conductindependent research and has both abroad basic knowledge of all areas ofhis or her field and a comprehensiveknowledge of one field in particular . Adoctoral candidate must complete all requirements no later than tenyears from matriculation or seven yearsfrom the time of his or her matricula - tion if the candidate holds a master's degree. Course of Study: Students must com- plete 36 points of course work in addi-tion to their M.A. degree (which willbe assessed at 36 points) for a total of72 points; three qualifying exams; a foreign language requirement; an oral defense of a dissertation proposal; adoctoral dissertation; and a dissertationdefense open to faculty and students.Students are permitted to take up totwo classes outside the department oras independent study.

Internships: It is possible for Ph.D. students to receive independent study credit for work at various film libraries,associations, and archives (such as the Donnell Library, the Association of Independent Video and Filmmakers, and the Museum of Modern Art). Permission from a liaison at the insti - tution and from a faculty adviser isrequired for such work. Incompletes: The department strongly discourages grades of \"incom-plete.\" Any incompletes granted mustbe made up before the end of the nextsemester. Outstanding incompletes may render a student ineligible for assistantships and financial aid. See theGSAS guidelines for completion dead-lines for incompletes. The dissertationdefense cannot be scheduled if out-standing incompletes exist. Qualifying Examinations: Each stu- dent must pass three exams: one in the field of film/culture/media theory, one in the field of film/media history, andone in a third area drawn from theexisting exam offerings or drawn up inconsultation with the student's facultyadviser as a special area of study thatrelates to the student' sproposed disser - tation topic. The theory exam areas include gender ,sexuality, and represen- tation; race, nation, and representation; cultural theory; media theory; ofnarrative and genre; theory of soundand The areas the American film\u20141895 American 1960,or American ent; history of French film; history ofItalian film; history of Japanese film;history of Soviet and post-Soviet film;history of German film; history theinternational avant-garde; history ofdocumentary film; history of LatinAmerican film; history of British film. All exams are take-home exams. The take-home exam consists of six questions, of which three are to be answered in the form of a 10-pageessay per question. The student hasone week to complete the take-homeexam. Each subject area is offered forexamination once a year either in thefall or spring semester. A schedule ofthe areas offered in a particular semes- ter is available from the department atthe beginning of each academic year.Exams are graded by three facultymembers. The student receives a gradeofhigh pass, pass, or fail. If a student fails an examination, the exam in thesame subject area must be taken the next time it is offered. Upon failing anexam in any one area twice, the stu- dent must leave the Ph.D. program. Students sit for their qualifying exams in their first, second, and third semes-ters of course work. Foreign Language Requirement: A student must demonstrate proficiency in one foreign language. Six languages are accepted toward fulfilling thePh.D. language requirement: Chinese,French, German, Italian, Russian, and Spanish. Students already proficient in alanguage other than English may request an exemption from this requirement from the director of grad - uate studies. Language proficiency maybe demonstrated by any of the follow-ing: (1) passing the foreign languageproficiency examination given by theGraduate School of Arts and Science;(2) passing a departmental examina-tion; or (3) completing, or having com- pleted not more than two years before matriculation, a full or final intermedi - ate-level college course in the languagewith a transcript grade of B or better.School of Continuing and ProfessionalStudies (SCPS) courses do not satisfythis requirement; however, studentswith no previous knowledge of a for- eign language or those who wish a review are encouraged to enroll in theSCPS special reading courses for gradu-ate degree candidates. For information,call the SCPS Foreign LanguageProgram, 212-998-7030.

The distributedcomputing group manages a dedicatedcluster of PCs and workstations for experiments in robust distributedsystems.COMPUTER SCIENCE 103Courses are generally scheduled from 5 to 7 p.m. or from 7 to 9 p.m.; how-ever, honors courses (intended prima-rily for full-time Ph.D. students) areheld during afternoon hours. For courses requiring programming, students may use the Courant Institute's computing facilities. Detailed course descriptions may be accessed each semester from the \"Course Home Pages\" links on the department's Web site. PREPARATORY ACCELERATED COURSE (PAC) Applicants to the master's programs who have insufficient background incomputer science but are otherwise admissible are referred to PAC. These two courses (part one, which is offeredin the fall, and part two, in the spring) are designed to fulfill the minimum prerequisites for beginning a master'sprogram in computer science or infor-mation systems. Those admitted to theM.S. program with the requirement tocomplete PAC are considered M.S.degree students while they are enrolledin PAC courses, although the creditsfor the courses do not count towardthe M.S. degree. Applicants should apply for their ultimate degree objective rather thanfor PAC, even if they expect to be required to take these courses.

This course offers a critical revision ofthe history of the genre of ethno-graphic film, the central debates it hasengaged around cross-cultural repre - sentation, and the theoretical and cine - matic responses to questions of thescreen representation of culture, from the early romantic constructions ofRobert Flaherty to current work infilm, television, and video on the partof indigenous people throughout theworld. Ethnographic film has a pecu-liar and highly contested status withinanthropology ,cinema studies, and doc -umentary practice. This seminar situ - ates ethnographic film within the wider project of the representation ofcultural lives, and especially of\"natives.\" Starting with what areregarded as the first examples of thegenre, the course examines how theseemerged in a particular intellectual context and political economy. It then considers the key works that havedefined the genre and the epistemo-logical and formal innovations associ-ated with them, addressing questionsconcerning social theory, documentary,as well as the institutional structuresthrough which they are funded, dis -tributed, and seen by various audi - ences. Throughout, the course keeps in mind the properties of film as a signi-fying practice, its status as a form ofknowledge, and the ethical and politi-cal concerns raised by cross-culturalrepresentation. Culture and Media II: Ethnography of Media G14.1216 Ginsburg, Himpele. 4 points. In the last decade, a new field\u2014the ethnography of media\u2014has emergedas an exciting new arena of research.While claims about media in people' s lives are made on a daily basis, surpris -110 CULTURE AND MEDIAingly little research has actually attempted to look at how media is part of the naturally occurring lived reali-ties of people's lives. In the last decade, anthropologists and media scholarsinterested in film, television, and video have been turning their attentionincreasingly beyond the text andempiricist notions of audiences to con-sider, ethnographically, the complexsocial worlds in which media is pro-duced, circulated, and consumed, athome and elsewhere. This work theo-rizes media studies from the point ofview of cross-cultural ethnographic realities and anthropology from the perspective of new spaces of communi-cation focusing on the social, eco- nomic, and political life of media and how it makes a difference in the dailylives of people as a practice, whether inproduction, reception, or circulation. Cultural Theory and the Documentary H72.2001 Taught by Cinema Studies faculty .4points. Advanced seminar that considers anthropological, historical, gender, sci-ence, sociological, and cultural studiestheory in the light of a range of docu - mentary genres: counter-colonial, direct cinema, ethnographic, instruc-tional, historical, and auteurist. Television: History and Culture H72.1026 McCarthy. 4 points. Examines the background, context, and history of radio, television, video,and sound. Topics include politics andeconomics of media institutions; audi - ences and reception; cultural andbroadcast policy; aesthetic modes andmovements. Social Anthropology Theory and Practice G14.1010 Myers. 4 points. This course is intended to acquaint graduate students in anthropologywith some core issues in social/cultural anthropology. It cannot pretend to be acomprehensive introduction to the discipline; matters are too complex. Instead it seeks to highlight basicissues in social theory and the relation- ship of theory and ethnographic prac-tice. It proceeds through aconsideration of key controversieswithin the field and through mappingsome contemporary directions.Although the course covers materialfrom the 19th through the 20th cen-turies, it is not a history of anthropo-logical thought; students are expected to complement this course with History of Anthropology (G14.1636)and a lifetime of reading in anthropol- ogy and related fields. The Language of Sight and Sound H72.1998 Taught by Tisch School of the Arts faculty. 8 points. Intensive six-week hands-on summer production course (early June to mid-July) in practical 16 mm filmmaking.Students are required to complete fiveshort films using equipment andmaterials provided. Emphasis is ini - tially on documentary techniques, which rely on editing for meaning. Students then move on to the scriptednarrative. The goal is to develop tech - nical skills while exploring creativepossibilities. Early application isencouraged, as this is a limited-enroll-ment workshop. Video Production Seminar I, II G14.1218, 1219 Open only to students in the Program in Culture and Media.Limited to 10 students. Prerequisites:G14.1215, H72.1998, and permission ofthe instructor. Ginsburg, Himpele. 4 pointsper term. Yearlong seminar in ethnographic doc- umentary video production usingstate-of-the-art digital video equip-ment for students in the Program in Culture and Media. The first portion of the course is dedicated to instruc-tion, exercises, and reading, familiariz- ing students with fundamentals ofvideo production and their application to a broad conception of ethnographicand documentary approaches.Assignments undertaken in the fallraise representational, methodological,and ethical issues in approaching andworking through an ethnographic anddocumentary project. Students developatopic and field site for their project early in the fall term, begin their shooting, and complete a short (5- to 10-minute) edited tape by the end ofthis semester. This work should demonstrate competence in shooting and editing using digital camera/audioand Final Cut Pro nonlinear editingsystems. Students devote the springsemester to intensive work on the project, continuing to shoot and edit, presenting work to the class and com - pleting their (approximately 20-minute) ethnographic documentaries.Student work is presented and cri-tiqued during class sessions, and atten - dance and participation in group critiques and lab sessions is manda- tory. Students should come into theclass with project ideas already well-developed. Students who have notcompleted the work assigned in thefirst semester are not allowed to regis-ter for the second semester .There is no lab fee, but students are expected to provide their own videotapes. In addi-tion to class time, there are regulartechnical lab sessions on the use ofequipment.East Asian StudiesDEPARTMENT OF FacultyThe intellectual strength and identity of our graduate program lies, first of all, in its sharp focus on the modern period and in its dedication to a theo-retically informed, interdisciplinaryapproach to the study of culture andsociety of modern East Asia. Our corefaculty members specialize in modernChinese, Japanese, and Korean lan-guages and literatures, Chinese andJapanese film and media studies, mod-ern Chinese and Japanese intellectualand cultural history, modern Koreansociety, and comparative studies ofnationalism, colonialism, revolution,and cultural politics. This unit of expertise is further reinforced by an array of associated members in history, anthropology, religious studies, arthistory, and cinema studies whosework is mainly concerned with mod-ern East Asia. This intellectual config-uration, both sound in a traditionalacademic sense and marking a depar-ture from the older area studies model,allows us to address many deep-seatedand pressing issues of modern EastAsia\u2014as they take shape in the com-plex of global relations\u2014with a depthof knowledge and critical rigor.

EAST ASIAN STUDIES 111CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Moss Roberts DIRECTOR OF GRADUATE STUDIES: Professor Xudong Zhang he graduate pro- gram in EastAsian culture offered by the Department of East Asian Studies is concerned with cul - ture, media, intellectual politics,and questions of representationas they relate to the formation of East Asian societies such as China, Japan, and Korea inmodern times. Rather than pur - sue the practice of area studies inthe traditional sense, the pro- gram is committed to a criticaland, whenever possible, interdis - ciplinary examination of EastAsia's modernity in a global con-figuration. While the program emphasizes how received pastsinteract in the modern present of these societies, the principalemphasis is on the question ofmodernity in search of its own historicity as both a historicaland theoretical problematic. In the course of their study, students are challenged todevelop a critical awareness ofthe political, institutional, and methodological consequences, as well as the historical provenance of both disciplinary-based andarea studies inquiry. Workingwith their advisers and other faculty inside and outside thedepartment, students are encouraged to design their pro - grams around literary and film studies, as well as studies of other media and forms of repre-sentation, theoretical or intellec-tual debates, historiographicalinquiry, questions of gender and sexuality, social and politicalmovements, or any combination of the above. As a part of the University community, the graduate pro- gram in East Asian cultureshares the general dynamic of NYU, which has been embark-ing on its pursuit to become atruly global university. The pro-gram closely works with otherdepartments, programs, centers,and institutes, such as the Departments of Comparative Literature, History, and Cinema Studies; the International Centerfor Advanced Studies; theCenter for Media, Culture, and History; the Center for theStudy of Gender and Sexuality; and the Institute of Fine Arts.This internal network of knowl - edge production, coupled withthe University-wide resourcescommitted to international stu-dent and scholarly exchanges,visits, and coordination, has cre- ated a stimulating environmentin which the student can thrive in his or her study of the mod-ern East Asia. 715 BROADWAY , 3RD Asian Studies, History.

M.A. PROGRAM IN EAST ASIAN CULTURE The M.A. program is designed for stu- dents who seek specialized and indi-vidualized enhancement of theirundergraduate education. The depart- ment offers an array of language courses at all levels in Chinese,Japanese, and Korean for the further development of language capability. Besides language instruction, thedepartment offers a wide range ofcourses in modern Asian culture, withemphasis on the literature and film ofChina, Japan, and Korea. Many ofthese courses treat these subjects in thecontext of such global issues as social - ism, colonialism, fascism, and modern - ization. In working out theirindividual course of study, those seek- ing the M.A. degree are expected tobalance out the different componentsof the program. For those who areinterested, some course work andguidance on premodern China is alsoavailable. Language Requirements: The M.A. degree in East Asian culture requiresdemonstrated student acquisition oftwo languages other than English. Asarule, one of these languages must be Chinese, Japanese, or Korean andattainment must be at a high level ofproficiency .While it is preferable for students to develop research compe- tence in at least two East Asian lan-guages, students are permitted to use aEuropean language as their secondchoice. Students may select one of the fol- lowing two options, met by formalcourse work, or its approved equivalent: Chinese: third-year level in modern Chinese; first-year level in Japanese. Japanese: third-year level in Japanese; first-year level in Chinese or Korean. Students are expected to be exam - ined for proficiency sometime beforethey take their general examination, and each student is required to com-plete a graduate reading/translationcourse taught by a faculty member orlanguage lecturer involved in the grad-uate curriculum. Degree Requirements: After success - ful completion of 32 points of credit in courses selected in consultationwith a faculty adviser and the directorof graduate studies, the student mustpass a written examination preparedand read by two members of the fac-ulty. The student must also submit aresearch paper on an approved special project to be read by two members of the faculty. In addition, the studentmust take the second part of the gen-eral examination in his or her chosenarea of research by the end of the sec-ond year. When the paper has beenaccepted, and the student has success-fully passed the general examination,the student is awarded the M.A.degree. Course of Study: In the first year, the student should take two to four lan-guage courses toward fulfilling thelanguage requirements; one coursefrom the Seminar on East AsianStudies series; one course from theEAST ASIAN STUDIES 113Theory and Methodology Seminars; and other courses in his or her chosen field. During the second year of study, the student is required to fulfill the lan-guage requirements, including the requirement in a second East Asian language and/or a major European lan- guage, by either enrolling in languageor nonlanguage courses offered inChinese or Japanese. The bulk of thecourse work during the second year, however, should be taken in the stu- dent's chosen field under various spe-cialized \"topics\" (Chinese literature,Chinese history, Japanese literature,Japanese history, etc.). A total of fourtopics courses must be taken withinthe student's chosen field. The studentis advised to take the second part ofthe general examinations in his or herchosen area of research by the end ofthe second year. The student advancesto candidacy upon successful comple - tion of this examination. The topic isusually limited to a national literatureor history, but with special permissionfrom the faculty adviser ,the student can choose to be examined in an inter - national movement (e.g., fascism) or aliterary-cultural phenomenon (e.g.,modernism or \"new cinema\") that cutsacross national examina - tion may be theory-oriented and inter-disciplinary in nature, but the purpose is to ensure the student's readiness forthe job market, which is still dividedby national and disciplinary bound - aries. A three-member faculty com-mittee (including the student'sadviser) is formed for each student tak-ing the second exam. The student andthe adviser decide on the formation ofthe committee after consultation.Questions are based on a bibliographyand a statement of teaching interestsubmitted by the student. PH.D. PROGRAM IN EAST ASIAN CULTURE Language Requirements: Areading knowledge of an additional East Asianor European language must be demon-strated, normally by taking a graduatereading course or by passing an exami-nation administered by the pertinentlanguage department. For nonnative language speakers of an East Asian language, two readingcourses are required. One of thesecourses should be at the fourth-yearlanguage level, which is advancedreading directed by a member of thelanguage staff. The other is a special-ized tutorial directed by a member ofthe faculty. All students working in Chinese language materials are advised to take at least one semester-long readingcourse in classical Chinese. Each stu-dent's program is determined in con-sultation with a faculty adviser and with the director of graduate studies inEast Asian culture. Courses in other departments may be included when-ever appropriate. Courses relevant tothe student's research but not availableatNYU can be taken through the con- sortium with Columbia University, CUNY Graduate Center, PrincetonUniversity, and Rutgers University. Degree Requirements: In order to satisfy the Ph.D. requirements, thestudent must complete 72 points (18courses). Among these, 40 points (10courses) must be taken within EastAsian studies, of which 4 courses must be in the student's area of specializa- tion, while others can be completedthrough courses taken outside thedepartment, such as directed readingcourses and research credits (a maxi-mum of 16 research credits can betaken over five semesters). Course of Study: In the first year, the student should enroll in two to four language courses toward fulfilling the language requirements; one coursefrom the Seminar on East AsianStudies series; one course from the Theory and Methodology Seminars; and other courses in his or her chosenfield. At the end of the first year ,the student is required to complete a research paper based on the two com-pleted seminars, addressing the theo - retical-historical questions concerningthe field of East Asian studies. Thispaper ,which takes the form of a take- home exam, is separate from the term papers required by the two completedseminars and constitutes a part of thegeneral examination. Two members ofthe faculty (one of whom is the stu-dent's adviser) grade the examination.In the event of a failed performance,the student is permitted to retake theexamination after consultation withhis or her adviser. During the second year of study, the student is also required to fulfill thelanguage requirements, including tak-ing the examination in his or her cho-sen area of research by the end of thesecond year. The student advances tocandidacy upon successful completionof this examination. The topic is usu-ally limited to a national literature orhistory, but with special permissionfrom the faculty adviser, the studentcan choose to be examined in an inter-national movement (e.g., fascism) or a literary cultural phenomenon (e.g., modernism or \"new cinema\") that cutsacross national borders. The examina-tion may be theory-oriented and inter-disciplinary in nature, but the purpose is to ensure the student's readiness for the job market, which is still divided by national and disciplinary bound-aries. A three-member faculty com-mittee (including the student'sadviser) is formed for each student tak- ing the second exam. The student and the adviser decide on the formation ofthe committee after consultation.Questions are based on a bibliographyand a statement of teaching interestsubmitted by the student. The form ofthe second examination can be either athree-hour take-home exam or a two-hour oral exam. Course work in the third year is designed to allow the student to renewhis or her inquiry in theory andmethodology and explore researchareas that are interdisciplinary innature. By the first half of the thirdyear,the student should finish all the required courses in East Asian studies. The student is advised to take thethird part of the general examinationat the end of the fourth year or thebeginning of the fifth year .This last phase of the general examination isbased on the student's conception of his or her dissertation research, whichincludes a bibliography, a methodolog-ical statement, and a sample chapterfrom the dissertation. The third exam-ination committee (with three mem-bers as required by GSAS) continues tofunction as the student's dissertationcommittee. Upon successful passing ofthe third and last part of the generalexamination, the student enters thestage of dissertation writing. If thestudent fails to pass the examination,he or she is given an opportunity,depending on the nature of the per-formance, to either retake those por-tions he or she failed or retake theentire examination at a later date. Ifthe student fails once more, he or sheis dropped from the program. Before graduating, the student must defend his or her dissertation in frontof a committee of five faculty mem-bers, including as many as two fromoutside the department. The defense isoral. The Ph.D. program requires all stu - dents to complete a minimum of 15courses, 8 or more of which must be inthe program. In addition, students arerequired to take 6 courses in a coher-ent teaching field of their choice.Students are encouraged to develop aprogram best suited to their intellec- tual and scholarly needs. While it is the purpose of the program to be as flexible as possible, given faculty and course offerings, students normallypursue work in one of the language areas or comparatively around a com-mon theme. Required Seminars: All first-year graduate students are required toenroll in a yearlong seminar,Introduction to Critical Asian Studies.This seminar may be team-taught by different faculty, and its aim is (1) to introduce the student to the institu- tional and political history of area studies as they have been practiced in the United States and, where relevant,elsewhere and (2) to familiarize stu- dents with current and historically sig-nificant debates in the field and to theintellectual, theoretical, and socialimplications of the study of modernEast Asia in today's world. This first-year seminar also concentrates on prin-cipal paradigms that have informedthe development of research agendas. Archives, Materials, and Research Procedures is a semester -long seminar required of all students in the program to be taken in their third year. Theseminar is designed to help studentsformulate an individual research proj - ect. Although its primary purpose is to familiarize students with a diversity of research methods and techniquesrelated to the identification of materi - als and the accessibility of collectionsand major research sites devoted toarchiving sources in East Asia, theform of the seminar is also critical and interdisciplinary in nature. Core Theory and Method: The 200- series seminars are designed to engageparticular theories or clusters of inter - related theories with wide-ranging rel - evance in critical, interdisciplinary research in modern East Asia. Howthese theories are implicated in EastAsian situations is explored to explain how theoretical formulations aregrasped as crystallizations of East Asian historical, social, and cultural circumstances rather than mere imported abstractions. Such explo-rations involve seeing how appropria- tions operate in specific circumstancestoproduce different and productive inflections that signify a lived and his-torical experience. In other words, the- ory (say, from Marxism topostcolonialism, from psychoanalysis to Maoism) marks the moments of how East Asian societies negotiated their own modernity. These core seminars deal with ques- tions of nationalism, imperialism,colonialism, diasporic movements, globalization and comparability,Marxism, feminism, modern- ization and modernism, gender andsexuality, class formations, productionof cultural identities, etc. Moreover, the 200-series seminars in core theories and methods areintended to be taken by students across the language groups. With per- mission from the director of graduatestudies or a student' sacademic adviser , these seminars can be substituted tofulfill requirements in the categories ofthemes, special topics, texts. Themes, Special T opics, T exts: The 300-series seminars deal with major themes, periods, movements, authors,genres, texts, and other cultural andhistorical forms. The 400-seriescourses offer more specialized focusand the opportunity for greater in-depth investigations of historical, social, and cultural phenomena reflect- ing the particular expertise and com - petence of the department's faculty. Students normally take 400-seriescourses only after they have completedthe required course work at 100, 200,and 300 levels. General Examinations: The general examinations consist of three parts.The first examination, on theory and history of the field, is taken at the end ofthe first year of graduate study. Students are expected to show criticalunderstanding of the institutional, social, and intellectual development ofEast Asian studies, as well as to demonstrate familiarity with majortheoretical and discursive paradigms in or relevant to the field. The BasicSeminars series is designed to help stu- dents prepare for the first examination. The format is that of a four-hour take- home exam, during which studentswrite a few short essays on the given topics. The first examination is admin-istered by an ad hoc faculty commit- tee, which decides on the topics and reads the results of the examinations. The second examination, taken toward the end of formal course work,usually during the third year of gradu-ate study ,is on the students' chosen fields of teaching. This is designed toensure the students' general compe-tence and viability as college teachers, although, under normal circumstances, the reading list should be relevant andleading to the students' work on theirdissertation. The teaching field can bedefined in more traditional terms ofnational literature or national history(such as modern Chinese literature ormodern Japanese history), etc., or ininterdisciplinary or theoretical termssuch as a phenomenon, a question, aproblematic (such as modernism ornationalism). The third and final examination is on the prospectus, bibliography, andmethodological statement of the stu-dents' dissertation. Students areexpected to present a substantive pro - posal of their dissertation research, adetailed projection of the progress ofthe dissertation, and, preferably ,a sample chapter .Successful passing of the third exam qualifies the students as Ph.D. candidates. 114 EAST ASIAN STUDIESCoursesThe following is a selected list of departmental course offerings. First-Year Seminar: Introduction to Critical Asian Studies G33.1001 Zhang. 4 points. Ateam-taught introductory seminar offered to first-year graduate studentsin East Asian studies. Provides a criti - cal overview of the social, political,intellectual, and institutional historyof the field of area/East Asian studies.Coordinated by the director of gradu - ate studies, members of the faculty and outside guest speakers cover areasof their specialty, such as Sinologicalresearch, the Cold War, the sixties,social sciences and area studies, therise of theory, and globalization.Parallel to a historical, chronologicalaccount of the evolution of the field,speakers examine the major researchparadigms and influential discourses,from the Fairbank School impact/reac-tion model to postcolonialism, from philology to critical theory and cul- tural studies. Cinema and Modernity: Melodramatic Imaginations G33.3615 Yoshimoto. 4 points. Examination of melodrama as a quin - tessential film genre and as a mode ofimagination specifically articulatingmodern experiences. Melodrama hasbeen extensively studied and analyzedEAST ASIAN STUDIES 115since the early 1970s. Unfortunately, a vibrant theoretical inquiry into melo-drama has been almost exclusivelybased on the study of Hollywood eventhough melodramatic film practicesoccupy a central position in cinemas of so many other countries. In this semi- nar, students focus on Japanese film melodrama as a genre and as a mode ofimagination negotiating the Japaneseself-identity in the age of modernityleading up to our contemporary times. The seminar's approach is fundamen- tally comparative: first become famil-iar with Hollywood melodrama andthe extensive scholarship on this sub-ject; then, closely dissect concreteJapanese films and relevant writtentexts not only to probe into the speci-ficity of Japanese film melodrama butalso to critique and revise the existingmelodrama theory and criticism. Historical Epics of China and Japan G33.0726 Roberts. 4 points. An in-depth study of the major epics of China, Japan, and Vietnam, from thehistorical-military and the social-roman - tic. The Chinese historical epic Three Kingdoms is read against the Japanese epic Tale of the Heike. Emphasis is placed on the political nature of the dynasticstate form, the types of legitimacy andthe forms of rebellion, the process ofbreakdown and reintegration of animperial house, the empire as dynastyand as territory, and the range of charac-terology .In the second half of the course, the Chinese classic Dream of the Red Chamber is read against the Japanese The Tale of Genji. In addition to the above-mentioned topics, attention isgiven to the role of women and mar-riage in a governing elite, the modali - ties of social criticism in a novel ofmanners. The V ietnamese national clas - sic Tale of Kieu is used as an introduction to the course because it combines all ofthe key topics. Particular attention isgiven to the ways in which Buddhist,Daoist, and Confucian doctrines func-tion in each work. The Asiatic Mode of Production: Theory and History G33.2530 Karl. 4points. Investigates aspects of the historical interpretation of China in the 19thand 20th centuries, focusing on thegenesis and development of one of themost debated and enduring tropes of the historiography of China: the Asiatic mode of production.Global Modernity: Politics After Politics G33.2610 Park. 4 points. The flourishing study of globalization in recent years has differentiated thecontemporary world from the preced-ing one, conceptualizing the former as late modernity accompanied by a flexi- ble capitalist regime, transnationalism, migration, and displacement and thelatter as modernity marked by aFordist capitalist regime, nationalism,and citizenship as a fundamental right. This course engages with streams of thoughts on global modernity. Inrethinking the periodization, thecourse considers economic logics ofglobal capitalism of these periods. Italso examines the shifts (and theirpremises) in the understanding of cap-ital accumulation, post/democracy , post/nationality, socialist hegemony,human rights, citizenship, and dias-pora. It considers the contestation ofhistory and historical change. The dis - cussion of these theoretical and con - ceptual issues is combined with readings on historical and contempo-rary changes in East Asia. Abroader goal of this course is to understand variant paradigms on modernity, democracy, and rights ofindividuals that have emerged afterthe dissolution of historically existingsocialism and the advancement of cul-tural studies. In other words, thecourse seeks to understand the state ofthe current politics that came after theputative end of (radical) politics. Seminar: Ink Painting in Socialist China, 1949-1976 G43.3010 Hay. 4points. The arrival of the Chinese Communist Party to power in 1949 led many artistswith a modernist training to give upthe media associated with modernismin favor of ink painting; these artistswere later joined by others originallytrained in socialist realism. It also ledto a demand for the depiction of social-ist themes by ink painters of all kinds,including those with a purely tradi - tional training. As a result, ink paintersdeveloped new iconographies for bothlandscape and figure painting, intro-duced new symbolisms into the genresof flower, plant, and tree painting, andcreated new rhetorics of style. Onceconsidered outside China as merecuriosities, to be appreciated despitetheir socialist themes for their evident skill, these paintings of the 1950s and 1960s have benefited from historicaldistance. Today, it can be argued thatthey represent a more considerableartistic achievement than Chinesesocialist realism, which itself has recently been the object of positivereevaluation. This course reconstructsthis achievement in its broad lines andmakes the case for the integration ofpost-49 ink painting into a global his- tory of modern art. No prior study of Chinese painting is required. Narratives of the Novel in Modern Japan G33.3101 Vincent. 4 points. Examines the rise of the novel (shosetsu) as the preeminent literary genre in modern Japan as a lensthrough which to read the discoursesof Japanese modernity and moderniza-tion. Looks both to the novels them-selves and to secondary theoreticaltreatments of the Japanese, European,and Chinese novel to see how debatesabout formal aspects of the novel suchas closure, free indirect discourse, char-acterization, tense, description, andnarrative dilation and developmentrun parallel to and sometimes stand infor similar concerns revolving aroundthe nation and the modern. Beginswith an examination of several pre - modern notions of the narrative and the literary, including the monagatari (tale), renga (linked verse), and Edo- period fiction and drama, to providestudents both with a background inthe various forms of narrative to befound in premodern Japanese literatureand an understanding of the way theseforms have been appropriated in amodern context. Compares theJapanese novel with its Euro-Americancounterpart to give students a sense ofboth the universality and the particu-larity of the Japanese experience ofmodernity. Colonialism and Modernism in East Asia G33.2570 Poole. 4 points. An exploration into the cultural and intellectual history of modernism inEast Asia. Particular attention is givento the relationship between mod-ernism and various East Asian socialformations of colonialism. Conceptssuch as colonial modernity ,semicolo - nialism and postcolonialism are inter - rogated through intensive reading both of theoretical work on mod-ernism and colonialism and modernistcultural texts. Although a majoremphasis is placed on literary mod-ernism, it is understood as part of abroader historical phenomenon that encompassed artists, philosophers, and other intellectuals. Contemporaryessays are juxtaposed with novels andshort stories, and, where possible,other media. The course also builds onthe recent proliferation of research on modernism in East Asia. Where possi-ble, emphasis is placed on the inter- connected nature of modernism in East Asia. Readings in Japanese Humanities and Social Sciences: AcademicProse and Critical Terminology G33.1280 Hanawa. 4 points. Scholarly reading and research in mod- ern Japanese. With varied content,approaches, and organization, this course exposes students to modern lit- erary and expository works, and partic- ularly to academic prose. Texts areselected to reflect circuits of knowl- edge and the development of discipli-nary characteristics in style. Some emphasis is paid to the choice of text in order to facilitate familiarization ofcritical terminology. Particular atten- tion is given to the role of translation as a means of considering the circula- tion of academic and intellectual ter-minology (and concepts) and thedevelopment of language by whichacademic discourse is conducted. Thecourse also introduces students tosome of the key reference work andmethodology for solving problems ofreading and interpretation at anadvanced level.Problems in the History of Early Modern China G33.1919 W aley- Cohen. 4 points. Advanced reading-intensive course intended for those who have already taken at least one and preferably twocourses in Chinese history and/or those with an interest in world history.Explores some of the most hotly debated issues concerning China 1500-1900. General topics include empire and ethnicity; China and the globaleconomy; intellectual life; gender rela- tions; urbanization; material culture and consumption; civil society and the existence of a public sphere. Require-ments include intensive reading assign- ments, active participation in class, papers (5-10 pages each). Anticolonialism and Internationalism G33.2571 Goswami. 4 points. An exploration of the diverse projects and imaginaries authored by variousanticolonial movements and intellectu - als in the early and mid-20th century . As a field of inquiry ,the study of anti - colonialism remains largely uncodi- fied. There is little agreement amongscholars about the character ,origins, and trajectory of distinct strands ofanticolonialism and even less analyticalconsensus on basic concepts, cate - gories, and questions. Preciselybecause the field remains open, andfundamental questions are actively contested, there are rich opportunitiesfor exploring and rethinking approaches to anticolonialism. Assigned readings examine key pri- mary texts principally drawn fromBritish imperial contexts in Asia and Africa. Topics include the imaginativegeography of anticolonialism, the rela- tionship in historical conjunctures, Pan-Asianism,the politics of utopia, and the imprint of diverse anticolonial movements in shaping the Third Worldism of the decolonization era. Theories of Modernity G43.2536 Hay. 4 points. This colloquium seeks to introduce, and critique from a non-Western per-spective, some of the theories of modernity that have been developed in recent decades by Western historians (De Certeau), sociologists (Giddens,Luhmann), and cultural theorists(Jameson). The course consists of amixture of lectures by the instructorand collective close readings by theclass. This \"pure theory\" course shouldbe particularly useful to students spe - cializing in modern or early modernart. 116 EAST ASIAN STUDIESECONOMICS 117CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Mark Gertler DIRECTOR OF GRADUATE STUDIES, M.A.: Clinical Associate Professor David A. Harper DIRECTOR OF GRADUATE STUDIES, PH.D.: Professor Debraj Ray he Department of Economics has aninternational repu- tation for the qual- ity of its faculty and education.The department' sPh.D. program trains students to conductresearch in the major fields of economics, especially economictheory (including game theory), macroeconomics, internationaleconomics, labor economics, development economics, indus-trial organization, and Austrianeconomics. Graduates of thePh.D. program are prepared forresearch careers in universities,government, and business. The M.A. program is more applied. It is one of the very few stand-alone master's programsoffered by a top-ten economics department. It is specially tai - lored to meet the needs of pro - fessional economists, governmentofficials, and economic consult-ants. An increasing number ofM.A. students are also using the M.A. degree as groundwork for pursuing graduate programselsewhere in the United States. The M.A. program may betaken on a full-time or part-time basis. The M.A. programalso offers an advanced certifi-cate in economic analysis withspecializations in internationaleconomics and developmenteconomics. The C. V . Starr Center for Applied Economics provides support for the research activi - ties of the department. TheCenter organizes conferences,publishes electronic workingpapers, provides faculty withcomputer support and research assistance, and hosts visiting academics. 269 MERCER STREET, 7TH FLOOR NEW YORK, NY 10003-6687 212-998-8900 WEB SITE: www.nyu.edu/econ (China).

Programs and RequirementsAdmission: Admission to graduate studies in economics is limited to stu-dents of outstanding promise. Allapplicants must take the general testof the Graduate Record Examination(GRE). All international studentsmust take the Test of English as aForeign Language (TOEFL).Exceptions to this rule include stu - dents who attended English-speaking college-level institutions. Studentsfrom English-speaking countries, suchas the United Kingdom or Ireland, arealso exempt from taking the TOEFL. The M.A. program is designed to accommodate both full-time and part-time students. The Ph.D. program isdesigned for full-time students only. Applicants for the M.A. program should have mastered intermediatemicroeconomics, intermediate macro-economics, at least one semester of cal-culus, and a course in statistics\u2014allwith a grade of B+ or better. Theymust also obtain GRE quantitativeand analytical scores in the 75th per-centile and above (around 730).GMAT scores are accepted in lieu ofthe GRE. International studentsshould aim for TOEFL scores above270. Successful applicants may also berequired to take a diagnostic languageevaluation test at the AmericanLanguage Institute at NYU and addi - tional English language courses tai- lored to the needs of graduatestudents. Applicants should have agrade point average of at least 3.25 intheir under graduate work. For stu -dents applying to the Ph.D. program, the M.A. requirements should be sup-plemented by at least one additionalsemester of calculus and one course inlinear algebra. In evaluating applicantsfor either of the above programs,members of the departmental admis-sions committee consider the follow - ing criteria: previous academic performance, quantitative GRE scores, letters of recommendation, personalstatement, and economics as well asmathematics backgrounds. Because ofthe diverse nature of such information,the admissions committee does notadhere to strictly defined cutoff pointson grade point averages or GREscores. All incoming Ph.D. students are guaranteed financial aid, renewable forfour years, conditioned on satisfactoryacademic performance. Financial sup-port includes certain obligations toprovide teaching assistance and may beconditioned on the presence or absenceof outside funding. There is no fund-ing for M.A. students. It is important to note that students who want to enter the Ph.D. programshould not start off with the M.A. pro-gram. The Ph.D. and M.A. programsare separate and distinct; entry intothe M.A. program does not guaranteeentry into the Ph.D. program. MASTER OF ARTS Amaster' sdegree in economics is an increasingly essential degree in a global economy. The M.A. program ineconomics at New York Universitycombines analytical rigor with anapplied focus. It provides studentswith a solid background in advancedeconomics for a career in business andgovernment. It enables students toupgrade their technical skills inapplied economic and statistical analy-sis. It is also an excellent preparatorydegree for graduate programs (e.g.,Ph.D. in economics, law degree) else-where in the United States. Graduates have been employed at Goldman Sachs, Bloomberg, Citicorp,and Credit Suisse. Other graduates havebeen admitted to Ph.D. programs ineconomics (e.g., Boston University),law schools (e.g., Columbia University), and public policy schools (e.g., Syracuse University). The M.A. degree in economics requires a minimum of three semestersof full-time study .The time limit for completion of the degree is five yearsfor both full- and part-time students. Course of Study: Formal require - ments for the Master of Arts degree in economics are the satisfactory comple - tion of graduate studies totaling atleast 32 points and the writing of aspecial project report. In order tograduate, students must complete atleast 24 points within the Departmentof Economics at New York University120 ECONOMICS(i.e., courses with a G31 prefix). (Transfer credits do not count towardthis requirement.) Most courses carry3points; the special project carries 2 points. Students must have a cumula-tive GPA of at least 3.0 (B) with 18points of B (3.0) or better. Students may take 8 points outside theDepartment of Economics. The M.A. degree requires five core courses, five elective courses, and a special project in economic research. The five core courses are Mathematics for Economists (G31.1001), Microeconomic Theory(G31.1003), Macroeconomic Theory I(G31.1005), Applied Statistics andEconometrics I (G31.1101), andApplied Statistics and Econometrics II(G31.1102). Special Project in Economic Research (G31.3200) is taken in thefinal or penultimate semester .The aim of the course is to integrate materialand tools that have been taughtthroughout the M.A. program inaddressing applied economic and policyproblems. Students are encouraged toapproach research questions from out-side a narrow specialization and to con - sider linkages between different fields. Elective courses are selected from the department's regular course offer-ings. Students may also select relevantcourses at the NYU Leonard N. SternSchool of Business. This strategy isdesigned to give students a well-rounded education that will be usefulafter graduation in the nonacademicworld. In addition to regular coursesin economics, students take courses infinance, accounting, internationalbusiness and operations research atStern. Highly qualified M.A. studentspreparing for a Ph.D. program may also take courses in the graduate divi - sion of the Department ofMathematics at the Courant Instituteof Mathematical Sciences, which offersbalanced training in mathematics andits applications in the broadest sense. MASTER OF ARTS AND ADV ANCED CER TIFICA TE PROGRAM IN APPLIED ECONOMIC ANAL YSIS The department offers advanced certifi - cate programs in economic develop - ment and international economics. Participating students must take therequired core courses (listed above) andcomplete the M.A. special projectreport. After receiving the M.A. degree,students may continue their studies toearn an advanced certificate with theopportunity to focus on one of the fol -lowing areas of study. (The advanced certificate option is also available toqualified master's-level students hold-ing degrees from institutions otherthan New York University.) A mini-mum of six specialized courses isrequired. When certain required courses are not offered, the departmentmay substitute other appropriate courses to satisfy the requirements forthe advanced certificate. Economic Development: This area of study is designed for those concerned with economic study of development policies in the less developed coun-tries. It is geared to those planningcareers with governments of develop-ing countries, the United Nations andother international institutions, U.S.government agencies concerned withdevelopment and foreign assistance,and corporations doing business in theless developed countries as well asother private organizations. Requirements include the core courses; G31.1603; where appropriate,G31.3001, 3002; additional electivepoints to complete 32 points; and aspecial project report. For the advanced certificate, three additional courses must be selectedfrom G31.1505; G31.1506; G31.1605;G31.1608; and, where appropriate,G31.3001, 3002. A total of 41 pointsat minimum is required for the M.A.and the advanced certificate. International Economics: The objec- tive of the international economicsarea of study is to train economists tofunction effectively in internationalorganizations such as the UnitedNations and its related agencies,regional economic groups such as theEuropean Union or the LatinAmerican Free T rade Association, national government bodies such as central banks and trade ministries, andcompanies in the private sector. Requirements include the core courses; G31.1505; G31.1506;G31.1402; and, where appropriate,G31.3001, 3002. A total of 32 pointsand a special project report completethe requirements for the M.A. For the advanced certificate, three additional courses must be selectedfrom G31.1603; where appropriate,G31.3001, 3002; (B40.3387); andInternational Financial Management (B40.3388). A total of 41 points at minimum is required for the M.A. andthe advanced certificate. Note: Courses designated by num- bers beginning with the letter B areoffered by the Leonard N. Stern Schoolof Business. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The Doctor of Philosophy is a research degree. It signifies that the recipient isable to conduct independent researchand has both a broad basic knowledgeof all areas of economics and a compre-hensive knowledge of one area in par-ticular. To qualify for the doctorate, astudent must satisfactorily completegraduate studies totaling at least 72 points (at least 64 in residence at New York University), pass three Ph.D.comprehensive examinations (in micro - economics, macroeconomics, and one area of specialization), write and pres- ent a third-year paper and, finally , defend an acceptable dissertation. Fields of specialization include eco-nomic theory (including game theory),monetary theory and macroeconomics,political economy, econometrics, indus-trial organization, international eco-nomics, labor economics, developmenteconomics, and Austrian economics. After passing all three Ph.D. com- prehensive examinations and havingcompleted 72 points of graduate work,astudent is asked to submit a formal dissertation proposal. This serves asthe basis for a preliminary oral exami-nation. When the dissertation is com - pleted and approved by three faculty members, a public oral examination is held, at which research results are pre - sented and defended by the candidatebefore a faculty committee. Reading proficiency in a foreign lan - guage is required, demonstrated by any of the methods described in the Degree Requirements section of this bulletin. Course requirements include Mathematics for Economists I (G31.1021) and II (G31.1022);Microeconomic Theory I (G31.1023)and II (G31.1024); MacroeconomicTheory I (G31.1025) two 3000-level courses (advancedcourses, seminar/workshops).

V . StarrCenter for Applied Economics.Students have the opportunity to asso - ciate with the Center's prominent visi- tors and distinguished researchscholars. PURPOSE The C. V . Starr Center for Applied Economics is the research branch ofthe Department of Economics at NewYork University. The Center seeks tobridge the gap between academic research and economic decisions in both business and government. TheCenter analyzes issues of important economic and social consequences toimprove tomorrow' seconomic deci - sions. These goals are pursued by the Center in three ways: analysis of cur-rent economic issues, design of tools tofacilitate economic decision making in the future, and wide dissemination of research results through publications,seminars, and conferences. RESEARCH ACTIVITIES The research activities of the Center are organized into two categories: short-term projects and long-termprojects. Short-term projects are major research projects that seek to completeaspecific piece of applied economic research in a period not exceeding 12months. Long-term projects are major research endeavors focusing on topicsof such fundamental intellectualimportance that one can expect the project will be continued past the ter - mination of the Center' sfunding. These projects typically involve atleast two members of the Center/Department of Economics at NewYork University . VISITORS PROGRAM Since its inception, the Center has funded a vigorous visitors program forleading academics from both theUnited States and abroad. These visi- tors have immersed themselves in many Center research activities,including seminar presentations,working paper publications, andresearch collaborations. Because of theCenter's close affiliation with theDepartment of Economics, graduatestudents have the opportunity toexchange ideas with these distin-guished visitors. CoursesCourse numbers consist of the gradu- ate department number (G31) fol-lowed by four digits. The first digitindicates the level of the course as fol-lows: (1) graduate course open to qual-ified undergraduates, (2) advancedgraduate course, and (3) research ortopics course, seminar, or workshop.

GRADUATE STEERING COMMITTEE Beverly S. Cohen, Judith D. Goldberg, Catherine B. Klein,Michael Marmor ,Toby Rossman, Jerome J. Solomon (Chair), Isaac Wirgin, and Judith T. Zelikoff.Programs and RequirementsThe areas of study offered by the program are biostatistics, epidemi- ology, ergonomics andtoxicology. The master's program offersenvironmental hygiene, environmentaltoxicology, and ergonomics and biome-chanics. The Program in EnvironmentalHealth Sciences collaborates with other departments of the Graduate School of Arts and Science. For example, a collab-orative doctoral program between biol-ogy and environmental health isdesigned for students who wish toobtain a solid foundation in biologywhile specializing in environmentalhealth. A description of the programscan be obtained from the environmentalhealth sciences (EHS) Web site at www.med.nyu.edu/environmental/graduate or the er gonomics and biomechanics (ERBI) Web site at www.oioc.org under Education .Applicants for admission and fellowship support should contact theEHS graduate coordinator at 845-731-3661 or the ERBI program administra-tor at 212-255-6690. MASTER OF SCIENCE IN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTHSCIENCES The M.S. program in environmental health sciences is a specialized course ofstudy providing students with theopportunity to develop applicable skillsand expertise in a selected subject area.It is designed for individuals needinggraduate training for employment injobs involving worker health and safety,health hazard communication, health risk assessment, and environmental analysis of toxicants, including relatedareas of administration and technicalsales. Potential employers include aca-demia, industry ,consulting firms, trade associations, and local, state, and federalgovernmental agencies. The expansionof regulations in occupational safetyand health and environmental protec-tion provides increased career opportu-nities for individuals trained in variousaspects of environmental health sci - ences. The program can also providesecondary school teachers with theappropriate background to allow intro - duction of environmental science into their school's curriculum or into exist-ing science courses. The program of study, which may be full time or part time, emphasizes anunderstanding of how to apply appro - priate scientific methodology to the solution of real-world environmentalproblems. It provides the student withabasic background in areas of environ- mental pollution, toxicology, and bio- statistics and also with practical knowledge on how to present scientific data and how to properly interpret sci-entific reports. Beyond this, the courseof study is individualized to the needsand interests of the particular student.To this end, students may take relevantcourses in other schools within the University, for example, in environmen- tal management and planning, environ-mental law, risk assessment, andenvironmental impact assessment. Admission :Applicants to the M.S. program in environmental health sci-ences are generally expected to have abachelor's degree in a scientific field,such as biology, chemistry, physics,engineering, or a related discipline.Exceptions to this may be made on anindividual basis depending on theselected course of study. Generaladmission guidelines are an overallGPA of 3.0 (on a scale of 4.0) andGRE scores of 500 verbal, 600 quanti-tative, and 4.5 analytical writing. Financial Support and Costs: All successful full-time M.S. applicants(ERBI candidates not included) qualifyfor these pay a stipend of $13,000 peryear plus tuition and fees. A compre - hensive list of University ,Graduate School, and departmental fellowships, prizes, and awards appears in the Financing Graduate Education section of the GSAS Application for Admission and Financal Aid . Course of Study: Awarding of the M.S. degree is dependent on the following: 1. The successful completion of 36 points of course work, of which atleast 24 must be in residence at theGraduate School of Arts and Science.Some M.S. tracks require additionalcourse work. 2. The satisfactory completion of a special project. Depending on the stu-dent's needs, this may be either alibrary thesis or a thesis based on alaboratory project performed under theguidance of a faculty member. The M.S. degree program in environ - mental health sciences offers two specialized tracks: toxicology and envi-ronmental hygiene. The latter specifi-cally focuses on the recognition,evaluation, and control of chemical andphysical agents in occupational settings.Required courses for the toxicology trackare Environmental Health (G48.1004),Communication Skills for BiomedicalScientists (G48.2025), Introduction to Biostatistics (G48.2303), Principles of Toxicology (G48.2310), and Organ System Toxicology (G48.2311). Required courses for the environmentalhygiene track are Environmental toBiostatistics (G48.2303), Principles EnvironmentalHygiene I (G48.2037), and Introduction toEpidemiology (G48.2039). In addition, students are required to attend departmental seminars and arestrongly encouraged to attend journalclubs. Laboratory rotations may bearranged in consultation with the stu-dent's academic adviser. Most courses areoffered at the Washington Square cam-pus of New Y ork University ,located in Manhattan, and most of the research isperformed in laboratories at SterlingForest in Tuxedo, New York, about 50miles northwest of Manhattan. MASTER OF SCIENCE IN ERGONOMICS AND BIOMECHANICS The primary objective of the M.S. pro - gram in er gonomics and biomechanics (ERBI) is to prepare students for pro- fessional careers in fields involved inthe prevention and treatment of mus - culoskeletal disorders, injuries, anddisabilities that result from the inter-action of physical, environmental, andpsychosocial factors. Applicants are expected to have the equivalent of an undergraduate degreein biology, physics, engineering, or health-related sciences with a total mean grade of B (3.0) or higher.Acceptance is based on undergraduategrades, GRE scores, professional or aca-demic experience, letters of recommen - dation, and an interview .All students are required to have basic anatomy , physics, and calculus. The master's degree requires the successful completion of 36 points ofcourse work. The program is designedto provide the skills essential for thedevelopment and management of mus - culoskeletal ailment prevention pro - grams in industry and the health careenvironment. The program also trainsthe student in basic research, studydesign, and the use of equipment andmeasurement techniques employed inergonomic and biomechanical evalua - tion and analysis. The master' sprogram encourages students to participate in ongoingresearch activities in such areas as ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES 141142 ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCESpatient evaluation and treatment, workplace evaluation, and workplace design and modification. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The Ph.D. training program is designed to prepare scientists for active and productive research careers and other professional service. The didacticportion of the program places a particu- lar emphasis on achieving a solid foun-dation in relevant basic sciences, whilethe research portion provides traineeswith the opportunity to design, con-duct, and interpret studies appropriate to address specific scientific issues in environmental health disciplines. Thediversity of the research within the pro-gram allows trainees to develop skillsusing various investigatory approaches. Admission: Admission is based on a strong academic background in a basicor applied science as judged by priorundergraduate academic performance,recommendation letters, an interview , performance on the general GRE, priorgraduate studies, and any relevantwork or research experience. Generalguidelines for admission are as follows: an overall GPA of at least 3.0 (on a scale of 4.0), a major field GPA of 3.3,and GRE scores of at least 550 verbal,600 quantitative, and 4.5 analyticalwriting. However ,each application is carefully considered, and there may be exceptions to the above. General Degree Requirements: A total of 72 points, as well as a doctoraldissertation, are required for the Ph.D.degree. At least 48 points must be fromdidactic courses; the remaining can beresearch and tutorial credits. Candidacyfor the Ph.D. is achieved through aqualifying examination, and the com-pleted dissertation is then defended in afinal oral examination. The qualifyingexamination consists of two stages: awritten examination, and the writing and oral defense of a specific research project proposal (doctoral dissertation outline). Doctoral students are requiredto attend departmental seminars andjournal clubs. New trainees are encour-aged to establish early and frequent dis-cussion with members of the faculty and to acquaint themselves with the types of research activities conducted within the department. This enables them to explore mutual interests, which facili-tates the ultimate selection of a thesisresearch mentor. To this end, all first-year predoctoral students are required to begin participating in a formal series of rotations within laboratories, selected onthe basis of their perceived interest andwith the advice and approval of theirinitial academic adviser. Presentations ofavailable research opportunities aregiven during the first week of each aca - demic year, in an orientation program atwhich faculty members describe theresearch opportunities in their laborato - ries. All students in the program arerequired to take three core courses inenvironmental health science. These areEnvironmental Health (G48.1004), Introduction to Biostatistics (G48.2303), and Principles of Toxicology (G48.2310). In addition,students are also required to take certaincourses in the basic sciences, the natureof which depends on the specific area ofconcentration. These courses are gener-ally offered through either theDepartment of Biology or the Programin Basic Medical Sciences. Beyond theabove requirements, there are no univer - sal course requirements. Thus, a specificprogram of study is arranged for eachstudent that is appropriate to his or her particular background and career goals. Areas of Specialization :The six areas of specialization offered in the programare biostatistics, epidemiology,ergonomics and biomechanics, exposureassessment and and toxicol- ogy (see www.med.nyu.edu/environmental/ graduate/phd.html for details on these specializations). The distinctionsbetween these areas are often more foracademic planning than for traineeresearch, and there is much overlap in the research approaches available. The full range of research resources within the program and expertise of the faculty are available to all trainees regardless ofthe specialization selected. Financial Support and Costs: All successful full-time Ph.D. applicants(ERBI candidates not included) qual-ify for graduate assistantships.Currently, these pay a stipend of$25,000 per year plus tuition and fees.Acomprehensive list of University, Graduate School, and departmentalfellowships, prizes, and awards appearsin the Financing Graduate Education section of the GSAS Application for Admission and Financal Aid . HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION The Graduate School of Arts and Science offers students a variety of housing opportunities through theUniversity' sDepartment of Housing, 8Washington Place, 212-998-4600. Housing is also provided in the Sterling Forest apartments. Contact Cindy McGinnis at 845-731-3500 inTuxedo, New Y ork, to obtain a hous - ing application. Since most courses are offered at Washington Square, stu-dents are encouraged to live near theManhattan site during their first twoyears. T ransportation is provided by van from W ashington Square to Sterling Forest to allow students to do laboratory rotations and attend semi-nars and journal clubs. CoursesThe courses listed below are generally given during the day at NYU'sWashington Square location inManhattan or the Research Laboratoriesfor Environmental Medicine at SterlingForest, T uxedo, New Y ork (45 miles from midtown Manhattan). All ERBI courses are conducted in the evening at the NYU/HJD-OIOC, located at 63 Downing Street, just a few blocks south-west of Washington Square. Many of thecourses are given in alternate years.Current course information and locationsare available in the office of the graduatecoordinator ,845-731-3661, or the ERBI program administrator, 212-255-6690. The following courses are lectures unless otherwise indicated. Environmental Health G48.1004 Identical to G23.1004. Lippmann. 4points.

Ecotoxicology: Hudson River Case Study G48.1005 Identical to G23.1005. Prerequisite: undergraduate biology or chemistry ,or permission of the instructor. Wirgin. 4 points. Ecosystems throughout the country are polluted with a variety of toxic chemi-cals. This course uses the HudsonRiver as a model to investigate theENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES 143sources, transport, transformation, toxic effects, management strategies,and remediation of polluted ecosys- tems. Over 200 miles of the Hudson River estuary has been designated a U.S. federal Superfund site because ofcontamination from PCBs, dioxins,and metals. As baseline information,this highly interdisciplinary courseinitially investigates the geologicalhistory of the Hudson River, its hydrology, and inventory of speciescomposition. Those chemical, physical,and biological factors impacting the bioavailability of contaminants to the ecosystem are presented. Efforts tomodel the trophic transfer of PCBs through the food chain are discussed. Toxic effects (cancer, reproductive dis-orders, immunological changes, etc.)of these contaminants to Hudson River fish, bird, and mammalian pop- ulations are highlighted. Models ofresistance of populations to chemicalcontaminants are explored. Accumu-lation of toxicants and possible effectson human consumers of Hudson Riverresources are introduced. Potential ben-eficial effects of microbial bioremedia - tion strategies are introduced. Problems and issues in the management ofHudson River Superfund sites are dis-cussed by regulatory officials as are thestrategies of advocacy groups to remedi-ate these sites. Impacts of remediationof one site on its natural populations are presented. Toxicology G48.1006 Identical to G23.1006.

EUROPEAN AND MEDITERRANEAN STUDIES 147DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER: Associate Professor K. Fleming he Center for European andMediterraneanStudies supports and promotes the study of con-temporary Europe, both W est and East, within the College and the Graduate School of Arts andScience and between the latter and the professional schools ofthe University .It complements existing European programs in both the humanities and the social sciences, such as theInstitute of French Studies, theprogram in Italian studies coor - dinated by the Casa ItalianaZerilli-Marim\u00f2, and the Alexander S. Onassis Program in Hellenic Studies, by offering courses and lectures on other major W estern European soci- eties and cultures as well as on Central and Eastern Europe. Italso offers courses, research opportunities, and noncurricular lectures and seminars on theEuropean Community and on European issues that transcendnational borders. Normally theCenter does not offer courses in subjects that are covered by other departments. The Center offers an undergraduate major andminor in European studies as well as a Master of Arts program. The programs, activities, and funding opportunities offered bythe Center and listed below arepartly supported by funds from a grant provided by the U.S.Department of Education, which in 1991 designated the Center,along with European centers at Columbia University and NewSchool University ,as a National Resource Center for WesternEurope. The three units operate together as the New Y ork Consortium for European Studies in outreach efforts toward otherschools and colleges in the region, research planning, and the sharing of visiting lecturers. Cooperation within this consor - tium permits graduate students to cross-register for courses at ourpartner institutions. The grant also funds the Foreign Languageand Area Studies (FLAS)Fellowship Program, which pro- vides full-year and summer lan- guage-study fellowships for graduate students in various dis-ciplines who are doing research on W estern Europe. The Center was also awarded two additional grants from theFund for the Improvement ofPostsecondary Education (FIPSE) to fund projects that providegraduate training to students interested in comparing theEuropean Union and the United States as federal systems and tothose interested in issues of transnationalism, internationalmigration, race, ethnocentrism, and the state. The Center represents the University in the Council forEuropean Studies, a national association of European pro- grams, and in expanding rela - tions with similar programs in European universities.58 WEST 10TH STREET NEW YORK, NY 10011-8702 212-998-3838 FAX: 212-995-4188 TPrograms and RequirementsMASTER OF ARTS The Master of Arts program in European studies is an interdisciplinaryprogram in the social sciences andhumanities designed to prepare stu-dents for professions requiring anadvanced understanding of Europe.The program draws upon the estab-lished resources of existing country programs in French studies, Italianstudies, and Hellenic studies, as well as the disciplinary programs, and alsooffers courses of its own. M.A. studentschoose one of three tracks for special - ization: European politics and society,humanities and cultural trends inWestern and/or East Central Europe, and European Union studies. Specialprograms of study are also possible. Eight courses (32 points), a thesis or aspecial project, and an oral examina - tion are required for the M.A. degree.Knowledge of a European language(other than English) at the advancedlevel is also required. Students canprove this advanced knowledge eitherby having completed during theirundergraduate studies an advanced-level language course or by passing theGSAS foreign language proficiencyexamination prior to graduation.Knowledge of a second European lan-guage is also encouraged. An intern- ship approved by the M.A. adviser is recommended. Of the eight courses, two (an intro - ductory course and a research seminar in European studies) are required, andsix elective courses must be chosenfrom the program courses in the socialsciences or the humanities, dependingon which track the student chooses for specialization. An internship or a research seminar (4 points/one course),arranged and approved by the Center,is accepted as a final course. STUDY ABROAD Candidates for the M.A. degree in European studies are encouraged tospend one semester abroad. COMFED Consortium: As part of the Comparative FederalismConsortium (COMFED), the Centerfor European Studies received a three-year grant from the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE, U.S. Department ofEducation) for a program that pro - motes collaborative teaching andresearch on issues related to the com-parison of the United States and theEuropean Union as political, eco - nomic, and legal systems. The under - lying objectives of the project are to enhance scientific knowledge of thefield of comparative EU-U.S. studies,to educate a new generation of futureacademic and policy leaders in boththe United States and the EuropeanUnion about the similarities and dif - ferences between the two systems, andto promote better understandingbetween the two sides.

Programs and RequirementsAdmission: In addition to the require- ments for admission to the Graduate School of Arts and Science (see the Admission section of this bulletin), can- didates for the Institute of Fine Arts must have a good background in theliberal arts, normally including at least four courses of undergraduate art his- tory. The Graduate Record Examinationis required of all applicants. The exami-nation must be taken sufficiently inadvance to ensure that the scores appearon the application when reviewed. (See Conservation Center, below, for additional requirements for admission to the con - servation program.) Applicants arerequired to make up deficiencies in theirpreliminary preparation. As part of the admission procedure, applicants with a master's degree in arthistory are requested to provide a copyof their thesis or another researchpaper to be read by a faculty memberin the appropriate field. For further admission information, consult the Academic Office, Instituteof Fine Arts, 1 East 78th Street, NewYork, NY 10021-0178; 212-992-5800; e-mail: ifa.program@nyu.edu. Also see the GSAS Application for Admission and Financial Aid. Registration: Fall, spring, and limited summer registration takes place byappointment made through theAcademic Office. Students from other New York University programs must consult the Academic Office before regis-tering for a course at the Institute. (Seethe calendar in the Announcement of Courses for details on the registration periods.) Nonmatriculated Status: Astudent in another university' sgraduate art history program may register for courses at the Institute by applying fornondegree status, with the permissionof the IF Adirector of graduate studies, through the Graduate Enrollment Services office of the Graduate Schoolof Arts and Science.Advisement: Each student in the first semester is assigned a member of the faculty as the adviser with whomhe or she plans a program and con- sults regularly. Minimum Program: During the first year of study, each student registers for aminimum of five courses. Exceptions are made only for urgent reasons andmust have the approval of the directorof graduate studies. The conservationtraining program must be followed onafull-time basis only. MASTER OF AR TS Language Requirements: To succeed in their graduate and professionalcareers, M.A. students need to beequipped to read the modern scholarlyliterature in art history, archaeology,and conservation. To this end, they areexpected to demonstrate reading profi-ciency in two modern languages otherthan English by passing a written lan - guage examination in each. In princi - ple, these two languages are German and French. The first examination mustbe taken at the beginning of the stu - dent'sfirst semester at the Institute, with a failure made up in the following semester. The Institute administerswritten examinations in German andFrench in fall, winter ,and spring; dates are posted on the academic calendar . Application to the director of graduatestudies is required to take either lan - guage examination for a third time. Under rare circumstances, if Italian or Spanish is the primary scholarlylanguage in the student's field of spe-cialization, that student's facultyadviser may recommend that the stu - dent be examined in that languageinstead of French. In such a case, thestudent's faculty adviser must petition the director of graduate studies for approval of the exception. Writtenexaminations in Italian and Spanishare scheduled as needed.The faculty adviser of students in the East Asian program may petition the director of graduate studies toallow a student to substitute a reading knowledge of Chinese or Japanese for French or German. If the exception isapproved, a written examination in Chinese or Japanese will be scheduled. Those students who fail the German examination are required to follow aplan of study approved by the faculty .A list of approved courses and tutors may be obtained from the Academic Office.The Institute offers a course in Germanreading comprehension. The course,taught by Deutsches Haus staff, meetsfor two hours twice a week. There is anominal charge. Students who wish tofollow a plan of study not alreadyapproved by the faculty must submitthe plan to the faculty in writing. Astudent entering with an M.A. degree from another institution mustsatisfy the language requirementswithin the first year of study and priorto the Ph.D. candidacy interview.Students with a foreign baccalaureatemay petition for the substitution oftheir native language for either Germanor French on the M.A. level only.Before applying to matriculate for thePh.D. program, international studentsmust pass tests in both German andFrench. Students in the East Asian artprogram may petition to substituteproficiency in Chinese or Japanese forone of the required languages. First-Term Paper: During the first term, all students are required to submit awritten paper ,the topic chosen in con - sultation with an Institute faculty mem - ber.In the case of students holding an M.A. degree obtained elsewhere, a thesis or paper written in conjunction with hisor her work for the M.A. degree may besubmitted as the first-term paper. Timing: Completing the requirements for the M.A. degree should not exceedtwo years. Students in the conservation154 FINE ARTSprogram normally complete the M.A. degree requirements in five semesters. Academic Standards: Each student's record is subject to review after the completion of the first semester andfirst year of study. A student must achieve a B+ or better average. Failuretodo so results in automatic proba- tionary status. A student on probation isexpected to attain a B+ average within one semester. Distribution of Course Points: A total of 36 points (nine courses) is required for the M.A. degree. Of these, 8points must be in two classroom sem- inars in different major areas as definedbelow. Of the 36 points taken in lecturecourses, seminars, colloquia, and read-ing courses for independent study, atleast one course must be taken in four ofthe six following major areas: (1) EastAsia, India, and Islam; (2) ancient NearEast, Egyptian, Greek, and Roman; (3)Early Christian, Byzantine, and Westernmedieval art to 1400; (4) W estern art, 1400 to 1780; (5) Western art, 1780 tothe present; and (6) African, Oceanic,pre-Columbian, and Native Americanart. At least one course must be taken inarea (1) or (6). In addition, one coursemust be taken in the conservation ofworks of art. Students planning to specialize in East Asian art may, with the writtenapproval of their adviser, take two ofthe distribution requirement courseslisted under (1) above. Two Qualifying Papers for the Master' sDegree: One qualifying paper is required in each of two differ - ent major areas, as defined above. Eachpaper is written under the direction ofadifferent instructor. The papers must be in publishable form. Topics may bedeveloped from seminar reports, from the first-term paper, in connection with a lecture course, or independentlyin consultation with a faculty member . For students enrolled in the conserva - tion training program, one qualifying term paper may be supervised by amember of the conservation faculty. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY Qualifying as a Matriculant for the Ph.D. Degree: The applicant must have fulfilled all requirements for theM.A. degree in art history and be sponsored by a faculty member. A stu- dent entering the Institute with amaster' sdegree must complete all M.A. degree requirements of theInstitute of Fine Arts (or provide evi - dence of equivalent work) within one academic year .During this probation - ary period, the student must also findafaculty sponsor. Students may be requested to show a reading knowl-edge of languages necessary for theirspecial fields of study. Students completing the master's degree at the Institute may take up to8points of additional course work before acceptance into the Ph.D. pro-gram. These courses are taken entirely at the student's risk and must beapproved by the director of graduate studies and the student's adviser. Candidacy Interview and Faculty Review: Acceptance into the Ph.D program is determined by (1) an inter-view with a three-member faculty com-mittee at the time the studentcompletes all Institute of Fine Artsrequirements for the M.A. degree and(2) an all-faculty review of the student'srecord and the results of the interview . Timing: The interview must be held before the end of the first term aftercompleting the requirements for theM.A. degree, except in the case of stu-dents holding an M.A. degreeobtained elsewhere, who must sched-ule the interview no later than the endof their second term of residence.Reviews by the full faculty are sched - uled in September, January, and Mayof each year. (See the calendar in the Announcement of Courses for dates.) Sponsorship: Application for the interview must be sponsored by a reg-ular member of the Institute faculty.Institute lecturers associated part-timewith the Institute may serve ascosponsors only if a regular facultymember has first agreed to serve assponsor. Advisers from other institu-tions can serve as dissertation advisersonly through prior arrangementbetween a regular faculty member and the student and with the permission ofthe director of graduate studies. Character of the Interview: The inter- view is administered by a committeeof the faculty and is oral. The studentdiscusses his or her proposed programof study ,i.e., choice of major and minor fields and possibly the subject or area he or she expects to treat in the dissertation. The committee, inreviewing the student's record, assesseshis or her basic knowledge of the his-tory of art as well as intellectual quali-fications and understanding of theareas in which the student plans towork. A major factor in determiningthe student's eligibility for matricula-tion for the Ph.D. degree is the evalu-ation of the student's proposedprogram in relation to the quality ofhis or her previous qualifying papers,seminar reports, and course work. For those entering with an M.A. degree, admission to the Institute doesnot imply acceptance of all graduatecourses taken prior to enrollment atthe Institute. If transfer of suchcourses is desired, the candidate mustpetition the faculty for approval immediately following acceptance intothe doctoral program. Distribution of Course Points: Atotal of 72 points is required for the Ph.D.degree, including the 36 required for the M.A. degree. At least 24 points (six courses) must be in classroom seminars, of which 8 points (two courses) must beoutside the student's major area of study.Of the total 72 points, 8 may be takenas the internship in curatorial studies. With the prior written consent of the director of graduate studies and aninstructor ,one or more Special Problems courses may be taken indi - vidually with a faculty member in lieuof lecture courses or, in exceptionalcases, of a seminar. Students specializing in East Asian, ancient Near Eastern, Egyptian, andIslamic art may be allowed up to fourcourses for undergraduate languagestudy in their field. Dissertation Proposal: Adissertation proposal must be approved by theentire faculty ,usually prior to the major oral examination. A Special Problems course may be taken with theadviser in preparation of the proposal.The proposal consists of a statementdescribing the project and currentresearch (1,000 words maximum), achapter outline (one page), a short bib-liography, and a single image. Twentycopies of the proposal, approved andsigned by the Institute faculty sponsor,should be provided to the AcademicOffice for distribution to the faculty .If the topic should change substantially in the process of research, it may benecessary to submit a new proposal. Final Examination in Major and Minor Fields: Students matriculated for the Ph.D. degree are required topass the final examination in one majorand two minor fields. A candidate maynot take the final examination, or anypart thereof, more than twice. Timing: Astudent may take the oral and written portions of the examina - tion in the major and related minor fields in the term in which therequired classroom courses are com-pleted, but no later than the followingterm. Note that the final examinationis not completed until the unrelatedminor portion is also satisfied. Character of the Examination: There are three components to the finalFINE ARTS 155examination: an oral session on the major and related minor fields, a two- week written paper on questionsdesigned for the individual student immediately after the oral portion, andawritten examination in the unrelated minor. Students may request exemp-tion from the examination in the unre- lated minor if they have completedthree courses (including a seminar) within the respective field with an average of A- or better. Major and Minor Fields: Each area listed below constitutes a minor field.Normally two contiguous areas consti-tute a major field. An additional field,the related minor, must be directlyrelated to the major, while a secondfield, the unrelated minor ,should be distinctly removed from the major field. Arelated minor outside the history of art is encouraged, and, in the specialareas of study of East Asian art andarchaeology, classical art and archaeol-ogy, and Near Eastern art and archaeol-ogy,it is required. The minor areas from which a student selects the major andminor fields for examination are (1) pre-historic and protohistoric art of the OldWorld; (2) African and Oceanic art; (3) pre-Columbian art; (4) early Chinese artthrough the Han Dynasty; (5) Chineseart from the Northern and SouthernDynasties to the Y uan Dynasty; (6) later Chinese art, Ming Dynasty to the present; (7) Chinese pictorial art; (8) Japanese art, ca. 600-1300; (9)Japanese art, ca. 1300 to the present;(10) Buddhist art; (11) Indian art (non- Muslim); (12) art of Southeast Asia; (13)Egyptian art; (14) Near Eastern art; (15) Aegean art; (17) Early Christianthrough Carolingian art; (19) Byzantine art; (20) Islamic art to the Mongol con- quest, 690-1250; (21) Islamic art afterthe Mongol conquest, 1250-1800; (22) Romanesque art; (23) Gothic art;(24) Italian art from 1300 to 1500; (25) Italian art of the 16th century; (26) art outside Italy from 1400 to 1600;(27) art in Italy, France, and Spain fromabout 1580 to the end of the 17th cen-tury; (28) art of the Netherlands,Germany ,and England from about 1580 to the end of the 17th century;(29) European (including English) andAmerican art from 1660 to 1780; (30) European (including English) andAmerican art from 1780 to the end ofthe 19th century; (31) art of the 20thcentury; (32) Latin American art; (33) conservation and technology ,in relation to a field or fields designated above, upon petition to the faculty.Dissertation: The dissertation is nor- mally no longer than 250 pages of text. Permission to exceed this limit can begranted only through petition to the faculty. The completed dissertation isexpected to be submitted within four years of the completion of the majororal examination. In addition to the copy of the dissertation required by theGraduate School of Arts and Science, candidates are required to file a second copy with the Institute of Fine Arts.Further information may be obtainedfrom the Academic Office. Final Oral Defense of the Dissertation: Each candidate in the Institute of Fine Arts submits to a final oral defense of the dissertation before a committee of five scholars,three of whom are members of the GSAS faculty. Scholars who are not members of the Institute may beinvited to consider the dissertation andtake part in the proceedings. SPECIAL AREAS OF STUDY Special areas of study follow the nor - mal requirements for the Ph.D. degree in fine arts and should include themodifications outlined below .Students must consult their advisers before reg - istering for any courses given outsidethe Institute. Students interested inany of the areas listed below shouldconsult the appropriate adviser . Classical Art and Archaeology: Students wishing to earn the Ph.D. degree with a specialization in classicalart and archaeology may do so eitherbased on art historical and archaeologicalcourse work or by way of interdepart-mental studies, i.e., with courses takenin classics, ancient history, and classicalart and archaeology. A faculty committee decides on this course of study in accor- dance with the applicant's educational background and special interests. Combined Studies in Near Eastern Art and Archaeology: This area of study for students working toward thePh.D. degree in fine arts includes thefollowing combinations: Egyptian/ancient Byzantine/early Islamic; Early Christian/earlyIslamic. Students should decide where their principal interest lies within the com - bined area of study and then study theappropriate language or languages. Atleast 16 but no more than 20 pointsmay be in the history of postclassical Western art. The total of these courses must be 72 points. East and South Asian Art: Students working toward the Ph.D. degree in fine arts with a specialization in this areashould take at least 48 points in class- room art history courses; they may take up to 20 points in Special Problemscourses (8 points for the M.A. degreeand 12 additional points for the Ph.D. degree) and up to a total of 16 points in credit courses in language and culture(of which up to 16 points may be for undergraduate study in language). Architectural Studies: This area of study offers the possibility for studentsto earn the Ph.D. with a specialization in the history of architecture and urbanism. The purpose of the program is to prepare students for research,teaching, and curating in this area inacademic departments, schools ofarchitecture, and museums. Study may include archaeological work as well as courses given outside the IFA frame-work in both architectural programsand art history departments wheresuch cross-registration is allowed, suchas at Columbia University. Certaincourses in history, philosophy, and thesocial sciences may also be consideredrelevant to this program. In formulat-ing the areas for which the student isresponsible in the Ph.D. oral examina - tion, architecture and urbanism maybe given greater than normal weight.All such decisions regarding the stu - dent' scourse of study are determined by a special faculty committee in accordance with the applicant' sback- ground and special interests, in con- sultation with the director of graduatestudies. CURATORIAL STUDIES PROGRAM This program is open only to candi- dates for the Ph.D. degree in the his-tory of art at the Institute. Theprogram is offered jointly by the Insti- tute of Fine Arts and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, under the supervisionof the Joint Committee on CuratorialStudies, which is composed of facultyand curators and includes the directorsof both institutions. The purpose of the program is to prepare students for curatorial careers.Problems of museum education andgeneral administration are not empha - sized. The Certificate in CuratorialStudies is awarded at the completionof all requirements.156 FINE ARTSRequirements: 1. Curatorial Studies I (G43.2037): This colloquium, focusing on the role and responsibilities of curators in art museums and emphasizing connois- seurship and research methods, is required for admission to the program;it is also open to students who do notintend to pursue the full CuratorialStudies Program. The course meets inthe spring term in the galleries, store-rooms, and conservation laboratories ofthe Metropolitan Museum of Art andmay be taken at any time beforeapplying for the curatorial studiesinterview (see below). 2.

In search of its own identity,contemporary poetry is the site of arigorous confrontation between \"say - ing\" and \"living.\" The study of theworks enable us to evaluate the impor-tance of the critical inquiry (aboutpoetry or art in general) that penetratesor accompanies them. This courseattempts to understand how languagelinks the poet's relationship to himself,to others, and to 4 points. Beckett' swork as one of the quintes - sential contemporary expressions of the human condition and as a funda-mental calling into question of lan-guage itself. The powerful images ofBeckett's fiction and drama are viewedas grim metaphors of existence, butthe tenacity of the Beckettian narratorto speak/write despite all odds may be considered as a possible positiveaffirmation. Sartre G45.2777 Hollier. 4 points. Overview of Sartre, with a concentration on the novels and the theory of narra - tion. Special emphasis is on the conceptof litt\u00e9rature engag\u00e9e, its archaeology and its implications. For ,if Sartre is credited for the concept, there always was and there remains today a great confusionconcerning the corpus of works (Sartre'sas well as others) and of genres to whichalabel that might be more prescriptive than descriptive applies. Camus G45.2778 Bishop. 4 points. Using a thematic approach, the course not only contextualizes Camus, the \"moralist\" and existential thinker(though not philosopher), in his own time but also relates him to our own.The course also approaches his books,plays, short stories, and essays stylisti- cally and structurally, as literary worksand especially as fiction and drama that inscribes itself in the major trendsofthe 20th century. A reading of most of his major works follows the evolu-tion in Camus's political, social, andartistic concerns. Some books (e.g., L'Etranger, La Chute) are studied as highly original literary landmarks. Studies in Contemporary Literature G45.2790 Selected topics are described below.

Exoticism, Ethnography, Errancy: The Postcolonial Moment in Francophone CaribbeanLiterature Dash. 4 points. This course looks at a unique series ofencounters that took place in the Caribbean during and after World War II between French writers escaping war-torn Europe and writ-ers in Martinique and Haiti. The experience of war and exile on thesurrealists traveling in theCaribbean led them to look atFrance for the first time from theoutside and to question the natureof the French colonial project aswell as ideas of cultural difference. The Space of Memory: Narrating the Nation in the FrancophoneCaribbean Dash. 4 points. This course examines novels written in the wake of negritude' sromanti- cizing of a mythical elsewhere andFanon's ideal of through aradicalized individual consciousness.The narratives to explore,rethink, and problematize the possi - bility of a roman du nous.

These fictions aretreated in the light of theoreticaltexts that deal - ory,and Identity Redefinedin Recent Francophone Writings Dash. 4 points. This course examines recent Francophone writing, especiallyexperimental prose fiction from theFrancophone Caribbean. In manyways, this writing emerges in thewake of the postmodern insistenceon the nontranscendental and theparticular as well as on the absenceof grand narratives for contempo - rary writing. However ,these novels also represent a reaction against theideological binarisms of the post - modern by exploring a pluralistic universalism and a transnationalcosmopolitanism.164 FRENCHFrancophone Theatre Miller. 4points. This into French-lan- theatre texts and perform- ances from four major Francophoneareas: West Africa, the Caribbean,North Africa, and Qu\u00e9bec. Focusingprimarily on West Africa and theCaribbean, students study the emer-gence of French-language theatre inlight of a particular colonial educa-tion and the fight to break free ofthat education. The class then con- siders the emergence of forms of theatre that combine elements oftraditional African and Afro- Caribbean expressive forms with elements that cause us to defineWestern theatre as \"theatre.\"Studying three key works fromQu\u00e9bec, students discuss an intrigu-ing development of Qu\u00e9be\u00e7ois the-atre from fierce nationalism tointernationalism. Topics in Francophone Civilization G45.1991 Selected topics are described below . Women Writing, South of the Mediterranean Djebar. 4 points. Examines the works of Marie Cardinal, FadhmaAmrouche, Assia Djebar, andAndr\u00e9e Chedid. How do theplaces of birth, childhood, and youth take their place in the fic - tion and nonfiction of these exiledwriters: through their presence or , on the contrary ,through their absence, which may be experi-enced as painful rupture? Can afeminine, sometimes postcolonial\"Francophonie\" define some ofthese women authors rather thanothers? The T wo Faces of Algerian \"Francophonie\" Djebar. 4points. For texts stemming from the Franco-Algerian nexus, it nowseems appropriate to deemphasizetheir sense of belonging to a com-munity (as in a collective history)in favor of a problematic thatgives full stress to the absence orthe addition of other languages(most often oral) in so many nov - elists, poets, and dramatists.Thus, following the Boudjedra,and Belamri butpaired or opposed to Senac,Pelegri, and Millecam. Does the multilingual ability of the formeraccentuate the conflicts, the vio- lence, the wounds of their writing? Studies in Literary Theory G45.2890 Aselected recent topic is described below. Theorizing Francophonie Apter. 4points. The course seeks egory of \"Francophonie\" in postcolo- nial studies while surveying some ofthe canonical literary and critical texts that have defined the field.

Studies in Genres and Modes: Prose Fiction G45.1123 Deneys-T unney . Reader-responsecriticism. Theories of fiction. Repre- sentation and ideology .Dialogism. Gender .Narrative and time. Studies in Literary History G45.2860 Selected recent topics are describedbelow. The Renaissance Zezula. 4 points. While the traditional history of lit - erature focuses primarily on describ- ing, evaluating, and classifyingliterary phenomena in terms of theirnature, significance, and order ofappearance, historical poetics seeksto define the system in which thesephenomena function and which,though coherent, is subject to his-torical and generic variabilities. Aseach of these approaches to literaryhistory has its merits, the objectiveof this course is to examine litera - ture of the French Renaissance fromboth perspectives\u2014a panoramicview of French literature from thelate Middle Ages through the earlyBaroque and an investigation of thecorrelation between literary dis - course of the Renaissance era and lit -FRENCH 165erary discourse in general or, strictly speaking, between literature and lit-erariness.

Autobiography as Novel: The Birth of a Genre Doubrovsky. 4points. Autobiography, long neglected by critical studies, has become a majortrend in contemporary French writ - ing. Most critical theorists contrast, as antithetical \"genres,\" autobiogra- phy, which strives to retrieve thetrue story of a man' slife as narrated by himself, and fiction, whichinvents a fanciful tale of imaginarycharacters. Yet, throughout the20th century ,many books appeared that erased the frontier between thetwo \"genres\" and moved freely fromone to the other. This course studies autobiography as novel in some rep- resentative and challenging works. Studies in Literary Theory G45.2890 Selected recent topics are describedbelow.

Each M.A. student is advised byamember of the Institute faculty, while each doctoral candidate nor-mally has two advisers: one from theInstitute and one from the departmentmost related to the student's disserta-tion field (i.e., anthropology, French, history, politics). THE MASTER'S PROGRAMS Master of Arts Program in French Studies The M.A. program is designed for stu- dents interested in careers in interna-tional business and banking, themedia, government, and culturalorganizations or in teaching Frenchcivilization in secondary schools ortwo-year colleges. The M.A. programoffered by the Institute can also com - plement work done toward a graduatedegree in French language and litera- ture. Full-time students can complete the M.A. degree in one calendar year ifthey attend the Institute's summerprogram in Paris. Those who do notparticipate in the summer programcomplete their M.A. requirements inthree semesters of study at NYU.Part-time students normally take twoyears to meet the course requirements. Course of Study: The program requires successful completion of eightcourses (32 points) and a comprehen - sive examination. The latter coversthree of the four basic fields in Frenchstudies: (1) French history since theAncien R\u00e9gime; (2) French society;and either (3) French politics and theeconomy since 1945 or (4) French cul-ture in society .Of the eight courses, at least four must be chosen from Institute core courses. Summer Study Abroad: The Institute offers one or two graduatecourses in Paris during the NYU inParis summer term, which typicallyruns from late June through earlyAugust. The course(s) are offered atthe NYU in Paris facilities and aretaught by faculty appointed by theInstitute. Students who take twocourses in Paris can complete allcourse work for their M.A. degree in one year . Dual and Joint Degree Programs The dual and joint degree programs integrate the study of France with thetraining offered by the NYU School of Law, the Leonard N. Stern School of Business, and the Department ofJournalism. All of these programsenable students to complete therequirements of the dual and jointdegrees in less time than if they werepursued independently. Candidates must submit two applications: one to the Institute and one to the respective school or department. Applicants mustmeet the admission requirements of both the Institute and the otherdepartment or school, and admission issubject to approval by both. The abil-ity to read French and to understandthe spoken language is a prerequisite. Dual Degree Program with Business Administration: The dual degree master's program in Frenchstudies and business administration offered in cooperation with NYU's Leonard N. Stern School of Business isthe first degree program in the UnitedStates to combine training for corpo - rate management with an integratedcourse of social and cultural studiesfocused on a major European country.The dual degree M.A.-M.B.A. pro - gram is intended for students seeking careers in business and finance thatmight require residence in anddetailed knowledge of France. Students in this program can com- plete the requirements in two and ahalf years of full-time study. One ofthe five semesters may be taken inParis, attending courses at Frenchbusiness schools and other institutions.Students may attempt the program on a part-time basis but must meet the requirements for both degreeswithin six years of initial enrollment.For further details on the M.A.-M.B.A. program, see the GSAS appli-cation and also contact the Institute ofFrench Studies. For Stern School application information, call theOffice of Admissions at 212-998-0600or visit the NYU Leonard N. SternSchool of Business Web site at www.stern.nyu.edu. Dual Degree Program with Law: The dual degree M.A.-J.D. program in French studies and law offered incooperation with the New YorkUniversity School of Law is of specialinterest to students who wish to con-tinue an undergraduate interest inFrench society and culture whilepreparing for a professional career inlaw. The influence of French law inEurope, in the European Union, andin the developing world makes the dual degrees useful for students who wish to work for public or private clients with business in those areas.They are also useful for future scholarsof comparative law, comparativejurisprudence, human rights, and legalphilosophy. Candidates for the program typi- cally have a strong knowledge of French and a desire to use the lan- guage in their professional work.Students currently enrolled in the NYU School of Law may also apply.The program can be completed inthree to four years. Normally, the firstyear of the program is spent at the lawschool; work toward the M.A. degreein French studies typically begins in the second year or during the summer between the first and second years. Further details on the M.A.-J.D. pro-gram are available in the GSAS appli - cation and also from the Institute. ForSchool of Law application information,call the Office of Admissions at 212-998-6060 or visit the NYU School of Law Web site at www.law.nyu.edu. Joint Degree Program with Journalism: The joint master' sdegree in French studies and journalism offered in cooperation with theDepartment of Journalism provideseducation and training at the master'slevel for students seeking careers asprofessional newspaper, magazine, orbroadcast journalists. Courses fromboth departments are combined toprovide the student with specializedknowledge of France and journalisticwriting and/or broadcasting skills. The degree is normally completed in two years, including a summer ofstudy and research in Paris. It requiresacomprehensive examination and final project, consisting of a feature articleon a subject related to contemporaryFrance or French-speaking countries.Further details on the joint M.A. pro-gram with journalism are available inthe GSAS application and also fromthe Institute. THE DOCTORAL PROGRAMS The Institute offers small, highly selective doctoral programs that pre-pare students for careers involvingresearch and teaching on contemporaryFrance. The programs offer two kindsof Ph.D. degrees: (1) the Ph.D. degreein French studies, focusing on Frenchsociety and culture; and (2) the jointPh.D. degree in French studies andeither anthropology, history, politics,or French literature. In recent yearsthe Institute has strongly encouragedapplicants to apply to one of the jointFRENCH STUDIES 169Ph.D. programs (rather than the Ph.D. program in French studies alone), and itcontinues to do so. Admission: Students applying for a joint Ph.D. with anthropology,French, history, or politics submit a single application, which must then beapproved by both the IFS and the partner department. In most cases,both approvals will be granted at the time of acceptance to the IFS, butpartner departments will sometimesdefer approval until the second or third year of study. (Students applying for the Ph.D. degree in French studiesrequire acceptance only by the IFS.) Students initially admitted to an M.A. program who wish to continue on to aPh.D. must formally apply for the Ph.D. program of their choice. Only afew such applications are approved. Course of Study: The Ph.D. pro- grams all require successful comple - tion of 72 points of course work, awritten and oral qualifying examina-tion, and a doctoral dissertation. Allstudents must first complete therequirements for the master's degree(see M.A. course requirementsdescribed above). Remaining coursework is chosen from Institute offeringsand from courses offered by otherdepartments (mainly anthropology , French, history ,or politics) according to the kind of doctorate pursued, the area of specialization, and career inter- ests of the student. Full-time studentsusually take three courses per term andfinish their course requirements inthree years. Most doctoral students spend one or two semesters of their third year in Paris, where they take courses at theFrench institutions with which the Institute has formal exchange agree-ments: the Ecole des Hautes Etudes enSciences Sociales, the Institut d'EtudesPolitiques, and the Ecole NormaleSup\u00e9rieure. Full New Y ork University course credit is given for courses suc - cessfully completed in Paris. W ith their adviser's permission, students may work at other Paris institutions,such as the University of Paris. After returning to New York, Ph.D. candidates who have completed 72points of course work design a disser - tation research project and take thewritten and oral qualifying examina - tion for the Ph.D. After successfully completing this examination andobtaining approval of a dissertationproposal, students generally spend ayear in France (normally their fifth year of matriculation) conducting dis- sertation research. Sixth-year students typically have completed their researchand spend the year writing their dis- sertation. Once the dissertation has been accepted, all Ph.D. candidates must defend their work in a final oralexamination. The Ph.D. therefore nor- mally requires six to seven years offull-time study. Ph.D. Program in French Studies The Ph.D. program in French studies provides the student with a broad knowledge of French society and cul-ture as well as a concentration in aspecialized field of interest to bedefined in consultation with facultyadvisers. This program prepares gradu-ates for teaching French studiescourses in French departments. Joint Ph.D. Programs The joint Ph.D. programs in French studies and anthropology, French, his-tory, and politics combine multidisci-plinary approaches to the study ofcontemporary France with rigorousdisciplinary training in one of thesocial sciences, history, or literature.Joint degree candidates normally pur-sue programs supervised by advisersfrom both the Institute and the disci-plinary department concerned. Jointdegrees prepare students for teachingin history or social science depart- ments and/or in the \"civilization\" track of French departments. The joint degree with French prepares for teach- ing in both the civilization and litera-ture tracks in French departments. Students in joint degree programs divide their 72 points of course workevenly between the Institute and thedisciplinary department, with mostInstitute course work being completedprior to receiving the M.A. degree andmost disciplinary work being com - pleted after receiving the M.A. degree.The Ph.D. qualifying examination foreach of the joint programs consists ofsections on French studies, on the dis-cipline in question, and on the inte-gration of the two. Examiners includefaculty from both the Institute and therelevant department. Similarly, thedissertation defense committeeincludes faculty from both units. Formore details on the current regulationsfor these joint programs, contact theInstitute of French Studies.THE CERTIFICATE PROGRAM The Institute offers a Certificate of Achievement in French Studiesdesigned for (1) students in other doc-toral or professional programs having aresearch or career interest relating toFrance; (2) individuals teaching orplanning to teach French in universi-ties, colleges, or secondary schools whodesire intensive training in French civ-ilization to complement their educa-tion in language and literature; and (3) professionals working in business,cultural organizations, government,the media, and other areas requiring expert knowledge of contemporary French culture and society.

It can be an end in itself for stu - dents whose personal and/or professionalgoal is an M.A. degree. It can be com-bined with a certificate in the archivesor public history .The M.A. can also be apreparatory graduate degree en route to the doctorate. The Master of Arts degree requires the completion of 32 points, of whichat least 24 must be within the historydepartment. No more than 8 pointsmay be transferred from other gradu-ate schools. A request for transfer cred - its must be made within the first yearof enrollment.

However, a student specializing in Middle Eastern history for an M.A.degree must demonstrate proficiency inArabic, Persian, or Turkish by passing,with a grade of B or better, at least twocourses at the advanced level or beyondin one of those languages. MASTER OF ARTS PROGRAM IN WORLD HISTORY The M.A. program in world history is intended for students who seek a con- temporary approach to historical studythat combines inquiry into the meth - ods and approaches to world history with comparative and thematic workand concrete training in one or tworegions of the world. Among thosewhose needs it may serve are highschool or college teachers, people involved in international occupations,writers and others involved in the fieldof communications, and those explor-ing their own interest in further study. Requirements for the program nor- mally include eight one-semester courses (32 credit points), consisting ofthree core courses, three courses in a major field of study, and two coursesin a minor field. Students must pre-sent a master's essay, and they mustdemonstrate a reading knowledge of a foreign language relevant to their work.

The available regions are Africa, East Asia, Europe, LatinAmerica, the Middle East, and NorthAmerica. Students must elect at leastone field outside of Europe and NorthAmerica. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The program for the Ph.D. degree pro- vides a framework within which stu-dents can acquire the followingtraining and experience: (1) broadexposure to a general area of interestand to its current literature and con-troversies; (2) more intense training inthe special field in which the studentintends to conduct research and do hisor her primary teaching; (3) a soundbut more limited introduction to asecond field; (4) training in researchprocedures and methods; (5) an appro- priate linguistic competence; and (6) the completion of a dissertationjudged to be a significant piece of his-torical research and writing. To achieve these aims, the program is made up of the following compo-nents. (For a more complete discus-sion, see the Handbook for Graduate Students, available in the Department of History.) Ph.D. Fields: 1. Africa 2. African diaspora 3. Atlantic world 4. Modern East Asia5. Early modern Europe6. Modern Europe7. Latin America and the Caribbean 8. United States9. Hebrew and Judaic studies (joint program) 10. Middle Eastern and Islamic studies (joint program) 11. French studies (joint program) Course of Study: Ph.D. students must complete 18 courses (72 points), which is the equivalent of six full-time semesters. All students must take theone-semester course Approaches toHistorical Research and Writing intheir first year and a dissertation-writ-ing seminar in their third year. Thereis no limit on the number of coursestaken within the consortium memberuniversities; nonetheless, each student should consult with his or her adviser on the appropriateness of the coursesand their relationship to the student' s course of study. Such courses cannot be taken in a student's first year of gradu-ate work without special permission.Doctoral students can transfer no morethan 40 points from outside thisdepartment. The request for transfer ofcredits must be made within one yearof enrollment. Foreign Language Requirement: Ph.D. students should satisfy the for - eign language requirement within the first year of graduate study; they mustdo so by the time they complete 48points of course work. The minimaldepartmental requirement is one for-eign language; additional languagesmay be required by the student' sadvi- sory committee. Students who choose the Middle East as their major field must fulfill the language requirementsspecified for the joint Ph.D. programin history and Middle Eastern studies;for details, see the Department of Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies section in this bulletin. Other areas requiring aforeign language for research may setparticular additional requirements.Students should consult their adviserabout what rules apply in their case. Students must demonstrate profi - ciency in a foreign language that has direct relevance to their area of study. The choice of language must beapproved by the student's adviser or bythe director of graduate studies.Students may satisfy proficiency in oneof the following ways: (1) by passingthe proficiency examination in the lan - guage given by the Graduate School ofArts and Science; (2) by having earnedagrade of B+ or better in an interme-192 HISTORYdiate or advanced language course in a college or university no more than twoyears prior to enrollment. Exceptionsmay be made for languages requiredfor primary research, by which a stu-dent's adviser may specify some otherprocedure as necessary to demonstratesufficient competence. The languageexamination is offered by the GraduateSchool three times a year. Qualifying Examination: Students must pass a written qualifying exami-nation in one of the department's des-ignated fields, as well as in a secondfield. Full-time students entering withabachelor's degree take this examina- tion at the end of the second year ofstudy; other students take the examina- tion within one semester after the com- pletion of 12 courses (48 points). Those entering with an M.A. degree from outside the history department are nor-mally expected to take the qualifyingexamination directly after they havecompleted six courses, of which onemust be a \"literature of the field\"course. Students who have done gradu - ate work elsewhere must, before sittingfor the exam, complete all work for thenumber of courses the director of grad - uate studies has determined to beappropriate in each case. A studentwho does not pass the examination hasthe right to retake it once. The qualifying examination is not a comprehensive examination. It isintended to test how well each studentunderstands and can explain historicalarguments and issues and bring to bear pertinent information and knowl-edge in discussing them. Prospectus Oral Examination: Each student must pass a 90-minute oralexamination after the language andcourse requirements have been com - pleted. Full-time students normally take this examination at the end of thethird year of study. Those enteringwith a master's degree should take theexamination at the end of the secondyear. For other students, the precisetime is arranged with the director of graduate studies, but it must be as soon after the completion of coursework as is practicable. The student must submit a disserta- tion prospectus prior to the examina-tion. The discussion of this proposal isamajor component of the examina- tion. The committee for the examina - tion consists of three faculty members: one is the student' smajor adviser; the other two are normally readers of thedissertation. Where appropriate, onemember of the committee may befrom outside the department. No stu- dent may sit for the major field exami-nation without the previous completionof the language proficiency specifiedfor that field. Students who fail themajor field examination may sit for itone more time, in the following fallterm. Dissertation: Each student must write adissertation under the supervision of amember of the department (joint advisers are permitted). The disserta-tion committee, including the adviser,has five members; a minimum of threemust be GSAS full-time faculty. Program Plan: Ph.D. students should arrange their schedules so that they cancomplete the required \"literature of thefield\" courses and at least one seminarby the end of the first year .The quali- fying examination is a major concern ofdoctoral students in the first two years,but students should also ensure thatthey begin serious work in the majorfield during these years, for the sake oftheir overall professional development.Astudent' sprogress toward these goals is taken into account during the evalu-ation the department undertakes foreach student following the qualifyingexamination. The third year should be devoted primarily to the student's major field,including the planning of the disserta - tion project. It may also, if necessary , be used for completing the secondfield. Major Field: Each doctoral student must designate a major field, withinwhich the subject of the student's dis-sertation falls and presumably the fieldin which the student expects to beprincipally involved as a writer andteacher. Major fields should be broadenough so that they can prepare stu-dents to teach an upper-level under-graduate course or a graduate colloquium, but narrow enough so that students can develop professionalcompetence in a body of literature,and each student's own primaryresearch can contribute to the prepara-tion. Major fields may be defined inchronological and geographical terms, or they may be partly topical. In each case, a student's major field should beworked out in discussion with his orher adviser and with one additionalfaculty member who has agreed to par - ticipate in examining it. Each field must be approved by the director ofgraduate studies. Second Field: Each doctoral student must choose, by the end of the thirdsemester ,asecond field and a secondfield adviser, who will examine the student in the qualifying exam.Normally the program consists ofthree courses. Asecond field may have the same dimensions as the major field, or itmay be thematically defined. In everycase, however, the second field maynot be contained within the student'smajor field but must introduce somesignificant new area or dimension.Second fields may also be arranged insome fields in which no major fields are available and may be comparative. Archival management and historicalediting also qualify as second fields,without respect to the major field.Women's history and public history, ifcomparative, also qualify as secondfields without respect to the major field. Transnational Fields: Two transna- tional fields contribute to the distinc-tiveness of our program, servingstudents across various fields of concentration. The African diaspora field focuses on the dispersal and activities of peo - ple of African descent, from antiquity to the present, and incorporates Africa,South America, the Caribbean, NorthAmerica, and Europe. The Atlantic world field incorpo- rates all of the continents that rim theAtlantic and spans early modern andmodern eras. FINANCIAL AID, ASSISTANT- SHIPS, AND EXTERNALFUNDING All students admitted into the Ph.D. program receive a five-year fellowshipfrom New York University thatrequires students to work as teachingassistants for three years. Students whohave outside fellowships are also con-sidered. There is some financial aid available for M.A. students in the archives pro-gram and for full-time teachers study-ing world history but not for otherM.A. students. Graduate students studying Arabic, Persian, or Turkish may be eligible foraForeign Language and Area Studies (FLAS) Fellowship. Graduate students are encouraged to seek external sources of funding,whenever and wherever possible. Thegraduate administrator makes availableto graduate students an up-to-date listof grants and fellowships. Smallergrants for special purposes are alsoavailable.HISTORY 193CoursesCourses are of several kinds: 1. Colloquia, based on common read- ing and discussion, in which students normally write interpretive papers,book critiques and review essays, and/or bibliographical essays. 2. Seminars, in which, after an initial period of common readings, studentswork primarily on a research project.(In certain cases students may alsowrite research papers in courses that are technically \"colloquia.\") 3. \"Literature of the field\" courses, designed to provide entry to a broadarea of history, through reading anddiscussion of a number of major issues,problems, and controversies that repre-sent traditional and contemporaryapproaches to the area as a whole.These courses introduce students to thekinds of materials and issues that aretested on the qualifying examinationand provide a framework for preparingto take the qualifying exam. M.A. stu-dents may be admitted to these courseswith the instructor's permission. 4. Methodology courses, intended to introduce students to a wide spectrumof issues, theories, and research strate - gies. Ph.D. students are required to take a methodology course in theirfirst year . 5. Independent study courses, devoted to reading, research, or some combina-tion, set up between a student, or asmall group of students, and a particu-lar faculty member. 6. Dissertation prospectus seminars. Ph.D. students are required to take this seminar in their third year. Doctoral students may, with the approval of their advisers, enroll in upto four courses in other departments;M.A. students may enroll in up totwo.

JOINT AND DUAL DEGREE PROGRAMS Joint degree programs at the doctoral level are available with the Institute ofFrench Studies, the SkirballDepartment of Hebrew and JudaicStudies, and the Department ofMiddle Eastern and Islamic Studies.M.A.-J.D. and Ph.D.-J.D. dual degreeprograms with the School of Law are204 HISTORYalso available. Admission to these joint and dual degree programs must begranted by both departments or insti- tutes or programs or schools upon entry or at the point of screening. Students in these programs normallyare expected to complete the \"litera- ture of the field\" courses and take thehistory department's qualifying exami- nation and a major field examination that may bridge the two disciplines. Joint and dual degree candidates areexempt from the departmentalrequirement for a second field. SPECIAL PROJECTS The Margaret Sanger Papers Project collects, assembles, and pub- lishes records documenting the life and career of the founder of theAmerican birth control movement. Located in the department since 1987, the Sanger Papers Project microfilmedthe Smith College Collections Series,consisting of almost 45,000 docu-ments; in 1995 an additional 9,000 documents gathered in an interna-tional search were microfilmed as the Collected Documents Series. Both microfilmed series are being published by University Publications of America,along with a reel guide and index. The project is preparing an electronic edi-tion of the microfilmed documents for distribution on CD-ROM or via the Internet. The project will then work on a four-volume book edition ofselected Sanger letters. The projectemploys graduate assistants and otherstudents. Documents from the Sanger Papers collection are available for stu- dent and faculty research and serve aspractical examples for the course on historical editing. For additional information, contact Dr. Esther Katz, codirector/editor ofthe Mar garet Sanger Papers. The Papers of Jacob Leisler Project is collecting, transcribing, and trans- lating the entire extant public and pri-vate correspondence of early New York governor Jacob Leisler (1640-1691) forpublication in microfilm and anno- tated book editions. Considered by some colonial historians as the \"Father of American Democracy\" and bestknown for the 1689 New York upris- ing that bears his name, Leisler playedaprominent role in the economic and social development of colonial New York and early America. Housed in the department since 1988, the LeislerPapers collection contains over 3,000documents in Dutch, French, German,and English that provide a wealth of information on the Atlantic world in the early modern era. The projectemploys graduate and other students to assist in making the collection available to scholars and the public. For additional information, please contact Dr .David W illiam V oorhees, director of the Papers of Jacob Leisler Project.HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL THOUGHT 205DIRECTOR OF THE PROGRAM: Robin Nagle ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF THE PROGRAM: Robert Dimit he Draper Program offersinnovative inter-disciplinary study in the humanities and social sci-ences that is both flexible and rigorous. The program is founded on a belief in the unique value ofcross-disciplinary research thatbrings together methods and materials from historical, cultural, artistic, political, literary, andother fields. Students choose from a broad range of courses to create indi- vidualized programs of study . The flexibility of the Drapercurriculum allows students to establish the links among disci-plines that best suit their intel -lectual goals and interests. Students integrate these variedelements with extensive facultyadvising and gain a solidmethodological foundation fromthe program's core courses. Theprogram is structured around six areas of inquiry: Art Worlds The City Gender Politics Global Histories Literary Cultures Science Studies Introductory courses familiarizestudents with the essential back- ground, the fundamental ques- tions, and the most currenttheories and scholarship in eacharea, thoroughly preparing stu - dents to participate in lar ger scholarly conversations. New Y ork University awards Draper students the Master ofArts degree on completion of 32 points (eight courses) and asupervised master's thesis. A minimum of four Drapercourses must be taken; theremaining courses may be takenin other departments and pro-grams of the Graduate School ofArts and Science. Either full-time or part-time study is possible, with mostcourses offered in the evening. Average time to complete thedegree is between two and three years; full-time students can finishthe program in three semesters. Students in the Draper Program interact with a talented and diverse student body, work with members of theUniversity' soutstanding faculty , and enjoy the vibrance of New York City .They also draw on the University' sextensive resources, including libraries,galleries, transportation resources, housing help, and athletic facilities. 14 UNIVERSITY PLACE NEW YORK, NY 10003-4589 212-998-8070 T FacultyMaster teachers in each area of inquiry play an important role in shaping theDraper Program. Senior members ofthe Faculty of Arts and Science whohave strong commitments to interdis-ciplinary scholarship, master teachers provide curricular guidance and help to maintain connections to the rest ofthe Graduate School. ADraper faculty fellow is also cho - sen for each area of inquiry .Faculty fellows are top-ranked junior scholars, selected through national searches,who are in residence at the DraperProgram for three years. They teach,advise students, supervise research, andkeep the program at the vanguard ofcurrent scholarship.Outstanding faculty from many departments and programs in theGraduate School of Arts and Scienceparticipate in the Draper Program.Professors from Africana studies,American studies, anthropology, biol- ogy,cinema studies, comparative liter - ature, English, Hebrew and Judaic studies, history ,journalism and mass communication, performance studies, philosophy ,physics, politics, and soci - ology regularly teach in the program, but in any given semester almost anydiscipline in the Graduate School maybe represented by the Draper Programfaculty .Additionally ,the program invites top visiting scholars to teach courses in particular areas of expertise.Julian Carter, Assistant Professor, Gender Politics; John W .

Introduction to Art Worlds II G65.1116 Focuses on questions of reception andinterpretation, particularly on the dis - tinctions between \"high\" culture andother cultural designations. How haveavant-garde notions and systems con-tributed to the \"culture wars\"? Whatrole do class distinctions have in theevolution of cultural controversies?How do notions of good and poor\"taste\" emerge, and how are theydefined? To what extent do debatesover cultural freedom serve as proxiesfor other political struggles? Possession This course recon-siders the relationship between spiritpossession as registered in diverse cul - tural contexts and the political demar - cation of the individual andcommunity .Students examine ethno - graphies, film, and psychological analyses of the significance of posses-sion and try to tie this discussion tocurrent debates surrounding the con- struction of national, racial, and sexualidentity. THE CITY Introduction to the City I G65.1108 Introduces the complex nature of thecity and the local and global political,social, and economic forces that shapeit. As these forces manifest themselvesdifferently in different localities, stu-dents study various city types, includ-ing the global city ,the modern metropolis, and the informal city .New York City is the main platform for exploration, revealing as it does thecontinuities and congruencies in the forms and processes that characterizecontemporary cities. Garbage in Gotham: The Anthropology of T rash G65.1813 Traces changing definitions of value and worthlessness throughEnlightenment, modern, and post-modern theory .Considers these through the perspective of trash,which is read as a reflection of contem-porary social mores, time/space com-pression, and fragmentations ofcultural identity, among other themes.Uses New Y ork City as a case study. The Contemporary City in Conflict: Militarization and Urban Warfare G65.2099 Seminar about the contemporary cityin low- and high-intensity conflictssince the Cold W ar era.

Introduction to the City II G65.2108 Students learn various approaches for studying the city by transforming atopic of interest into a researchablequestion, developing a research design,and identifying the most appropriatemethods for their chosen research proj-ect. An overview of qualitativeresearch methods is provided, boththrough the examination of existingstudies and the development of thestudents' own projects. GENDER POLITICS Introduction to Gender Politics I G65.1205 Investigates the relationship of theshape of the body to the shape of theself.

Students read accounts fromdifferent historical periods of humanencounters on and across the world'smajor seas and oceans\u2014\"contact zones\" that blur conventional territo - rial and cultural definitions\u2014and review related concepts, tools, andmethodologies adopted by world andglobal historians in their analyses. History of the News G65.1120 Identical to G54.0018. Broadly examines the cultural founda- tions of modern journalism; exploresassumptions built into the communica - tion called \"news.\" Particular attentionis paid to ways in which the medium affects content and perspective. African Slavery and the Atlantic Slave Trade G65.2051 Identical to G57.2555. Examines the institution of servitude and slavery in tropical Africa sinceclassical antiquity.

History, Economy, Society, andDiaspora in the Indian Ocean G65.2121 The history of the Indian Ocean isunique in its intensive indigenous com-merce before the arrival of Europeansand in the coexistence of European andindigenous trade during the so-calledmodern era. This course explores thehistory of the peoples and societies whohave \"made\" the world of the IndianOcean over more than 5,000 years. Thecourse pays particular attention to thetransformations of economies and themovement of peoples and culture around the Ocean into modern times.

Introduction to Literary Cultures II G65.1321 Investigates the ethical and politicaldimensions of contemporary critical theory .Also explores the ways in which literary texts articulate andunfold the ethical and political para-doxes that traditional philosophicaldiscourse too often characterizes assimply forms of error ,unreason, con - tradiction, or transgression. The Literary History of Sexuality G65.1323 Explores the mutually shaping rela-tionship between literature and sexual-ity.Investigates the ways in which Freudian and Foucauldian accounts ofsexuality are themselves determined bythe history of literary production,reception, and interpretation.

Heidegger and Wittgenstein G65.2192 \"Philosophy is an age grasped inthought,\" Hegel once said, and if the20th century was grasped in thoughtat all, it was by Martin Heidegger andHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL THOUGHT 209Ludwig Wittgenstein. If their thought iselusive, no wonder\u2014for their age made the very idea of comprehensionsuspect. In Heidegger andWittgenstein we meet two philoso-phers profoundly inclined toward the unity that metaphysics promises but forced to confront that promise as a receding possibility in an incompre-hensible historical moment. SCIENCE STUDIES Science, Colonialism, and the State G65.1105 Explores how science and technologyhave been used both to support and tosubvert colonialist and nationalistprojects. Examines political contestsover the meaning of the \"traditional\" and the \"modern,\" focusing on tech- nology, medicine, museums, schools, and weapons.Introduction to Science Studies I G65.1109 Surveys science from a variety of philo-sophical, sociological, historical, lin-guistic, anthropological, and criticalperspectives. Explores debates over constructivism, relativism, and the uses to which scientific knowledge is put by examining how cultural bound-aries between science and nonscience are constructed and maintained. Introduction to Science Studies II G65.1110 Examines how new and emergingknowledges and technologies, such ascold fusion, genetics, cloning, organtransplantation, and assisted concep- tion, are problematizing boundaries that are assumed to be natural and fixed, while at the same time remak- ing the social structures that support science.Modernism and the Alienation of Form G65.2190 Since the French Revolution, the ideaof progressive evolution gave Westernculture a unified sense of its place inthe great scheme of things, but the decades leading up to World War I saw the gradual decline of that para- digm. From the linguistic turn in phi-losophy to the professionalization of sociology, from symbolist poetry to cubism, from Bart\u00f3k to Bauhaus, fromthe New Criticism to socialist realism,apreoccupation with form emerged as the defining characteristic of a mod-ernism that could no longer rely onnatural design. This course considersvarious examples of that preoccupation in a search for the roots of postmodern dissolution.CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Associate Professor Ruth Ben-Ghiat DIRECTOR OF GRADUATE STUDIES: Professor Virginia Cox he Department of Italian Studies at New Y ork University is rec- ognized as one of the finest Italian programs in the country. It offers programsleading to the Master of Artsdegree in Italian, the Master ofArts degree in Italian studies, and the Ph.D. degree in Italian. Courses are taught by an out-standing faculty with specializa - tion in key areas of Italianliterature and cultural history. Specific strengths of the faculty lie in the fields of medieval and Renaissance studies; 20th-cen- tury literature, film, and cul - ture; postmodern Italy; the application of new technologies to the humanities; and culturaltheory. In addition to courses taught by faculty members, the program offers courses taught byeminent visiting professors from Italy and the United States. Therecently established Tiro a SegnoFoundation Fellowship in ItalianAmerican Culture allows the department to appoint promi-nent visiting professors to teachcourses concerning the experi- ence and contribution of Italianimmigrants and Italian Americans to American cultureand society . The Italian program attracts full-time graduate students of superior quality from all parts of the world. In addition to train-ing capable and creative schol-ars, one of the program's objectives is to promote theeffective teaching of Italian at all levels. To this end, students teach several Italian language and literature courses, normallyduring the second and third years. The Italian program also welcomes qualified part-time students who wish to obtain a master's degree. An interdisci-plinary approach is recom- mended: students areencouraged to enroll in addi- tional courses outside of thedepartment, e.g., courses in his-tory, cinema, comparative litera-ture, and the fine arts. NYU offers graduate students in Italian a number of uniqueresources. Students may take courses, pursue dissertationresearch, and do independent work at the magnificent V illa La Pietra, NYU' scenter for study abroad in Florence, and at theUniversity of Florence. Graduate students may also take advan- tage of the resources of CasaItaliana, one of the most activeItalian cultural centers in New York. Casa Italiana hosts collo - quia, lectures, film series, con - certs, and art exhibits throughout the year .In addi- tion, the Department of ItalianStudies and Casa Italiana or gan- ize the Zerilli-Marim\u00f2 Prize for Italian Fiction, awarded every year to the author of a new Italian novel, and host the win-ner and other authors.CASA ITALIANA ZERILLI-MARIM\u00d2 24 WEST 12TH STREET NEW YORK, 212-998-8730 SITE: www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/italian T FacultyMaria Luisa Ardizzone, Assistant Professor .Laurea 1967 (history), Palermo.

We want toeducate those who agree. Opportunities abound in the media world, but the opportu- nity to do compelling work that informs, engages\u2014and mat- ters\u2014 is what drives our faculty , motivates our students, andinforms our entire approach. Great journalism has always come from the great cities of the globe, and there is no betterplace to learn the craft than thecity of New Y ork\u2014where power and wealth concentrate, newsand culture originate, and daily events fascinate. Centrally located in Manhattan' sGreenwich V illage, the department immerses stu- dents in the richness and vitality of the city, while attracting to campus many of the leaders andthinkers in the journalism profes- sion. New Y ork City is our labo - ratory\u2014and our inspiration. The very first lesson we offer students is: Tap into it, with our help. NYU students study as interns in almost every major news organization in the city. They often graduate to jobs in newspa-pers, magazines, broadcast out- lets, and online operations headquartered in New Y ork, though some choose to go else- where. And every day ,studentsmove outward from the class- room to the city, on assignmentsthat take them all over town. The full-time faculty is itself of national stature in the journalismworld. As writers, reporters, pro-ducers, and critics, NYU profes- sors continue to practice thejournalism they teach and preach, holding the profession to its highest standards of public service. The adjunct faculty ,our teaching professionals, featuresworking journalists from all themajor news media, who share their wealth of experience and a commitment to craft. Each area of study pairs accomplished faculty who haveworked in the field with stu-dents who seek practical instruc- tion and intellectual depth. Most classes are kept small (12 to 18 students) to allow for one-on-one instruction. In addition to thegeneral M.A. program, general assignment and investigative reporting in print/online andbroadcast, the department offers specialized curricula based on subject matter: a concentrationin cultural reporting and criti- cism; a certificate program in business and economic report-ing; and a certificate program in science and environmental reporting. Students may alsoenroll in one of the department's joint programs: journalism and Latin American and Caribbeanstudies; journalism and Near Eastern studies; journalism andA 214 JOURNALISM JOURNALISM 215French studies; or biomedical journalism. Course work begins with the basic skills of reporting, writing, and research, but simultaneouslystudents are taught what jour-nalism at its best can be\u2014andwhat it should accomplish in afree and democratic society. Theyare also encouraged to publishtheir work, with assignments, internships, and online projectsgeared to this end.Housed within the arts and sciences core of a leading univer- sity, the department sees jour-nalism as an essential strand in the liberal arts tradition and acritical factor in public culture.But we also recognize that newsthese days is a business. Whenour skilled graduates enter thatbusiness, they are prepared toimprove and enliven it. Department facilities include state-of-the-art computer equip-ment; classrooms fashioned to generate an authentic newsroom atmosphere; the Center forOnline Research, which offers NEXIS/LEXIS and DIALOGcapabilities; and a fullyequipped broadcast facility withaTV studio and linear and non- linear editing and digital andbeta field equipment.

Students are advised by thedirector of graduate studies during their first year. After the first year of study, students select one of the law and society core or affiliated faculty asan adviser. Students enrolled in thePh.D. program in law and society maytake up to 12 credits in the NYUSchool of Law after consultation withtheir adviser and with the permissionof the instructor. Ph.D. students mayalso take a maximum of 24 credits inreading and research. General Degree Requirements :To qualify for the doctorate, a studentmust satisfactorily complete graduatestudies totaling at least 72 graduatecredits, with a minimum of 32 creditsat the doctoral level in residence atNew York University and a cumula-tive GPA of B (3.0) or better; passcomprehensive qualifying examina-tions; and present an acceptable disser-tation. Most graduate courses carry 4credits. Students may petition that alimited number of law and society graduate courses taken elsewhere betransferred and credited toward thedegree requirements, but only aftercompleting three courses at New YorkUniversity .Only relevant law and soci - ety courses approved by the director ofgraduate studies and GSAS may betransferred. Foreign Language Requirement: Proficiency in at least one language other than English is required of all doctoral candidates. Foreign languageproficiency examinations are at once an examination of both the foreign lan- guage and English. Currently, a stu-dent may choose to demonstrateproficiency in ancient Greek, Chinese, French, German, Hebrew ,Italian, Japanese, Latin, Portuguese, Russian,or Spanish. Students who use a foreignlanguage other than the above as anintegral part of their dissertationresearch may petition for a substitu-tion. Language proficiency may bedemonstrated by any of the following:(1) passing the foreign language profi - ciency examination given by the Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS); (2) passing the departmentalexamination, if one is regularly sched-uled by the department in which thestudent is registered; or (3) complet-ing, or having completed, not morethan two years before matriculation,with a grade of B or better, a full orfinal intermediate-level college coursein the language. Students who havemet the foreign language requirementin another graduate school not more than two years before matriculation in GSAS may request that such creden- tials be accepted, with the approval ofthe dean. The foreign languagerequirement may be waived withapproval by the LSP director of gradu-ate studies and GSAS. Basic Law and Society Course Requirement: This requirement ensures that students receive a compre-hensive knowledge of the social sciencetheories and research in the interdisci- plinary field of law and society. To meet this requirement, students musttake the two basic law and society courses with a minimum grade of B in their first year of study: SociolegalSeminar (G62.1001), offered each fallsemester ,andLaw and Social Policy (G62.1002), offered each spring. Students should complete this require - ment by the end of the first year of Ph.D. studies. Methods Course Requirement: To ensure that students receive adequatemethodological training for conduct-ing research, they are required to takeone quantitative methods course instatistics and one qualitative methodscourse in historical, interviewing, orethnographic methods. While notrequired, it is highly recommendedthat students take one advanced coursein either quantitative or qualitativemethods. The advanced methodscourse typically focuses on the meth-ods used for the dissertation research.Students should complete this require-ment by the end of the second year of Ph.D. studies. LAW AND SOCIETY 229Disciplinary Minor Course Requirement: All students are required to acquire a basic knowledge of one of the social science disciplinesengaged in disciplinary research in law and society. After selecting a disci- pline, each student is required to take three non-methods courses offered bythe selected disciplinary department. Agrade of B is the minimum grade required for each of the three courses. Law and Society Colloquium and Workshop Requirement: Law and society Ph.D. students are required to attend the law and society colloquiumand workshops during their first year of Ph.D. studies. Law and Society Written Field Exam: The law and society field exam requires that students demonstrate acomprehensive knowledge of the inter-disciplinary field of law and society.The examination covers material fromthe two basic law and society coursesand supplemental readings from thelaw and society reading list. The lawand society written field exam com-mittee is composed of the facultyteaching the two required basic lawand society courses. The exam is awritten 24-hour take-home exam thatis graded as pass or fail; it is giventwice a year .If students fail, they may take it again but are not permitted toretake it more than once. Students should complete this exam by the end of the second year of Ph.D. work. Law and Society Oral Subfield Exam: Each student is required to demonstrate an in-depth knowledge ofone of the subfields of law and society.Each student selects three NYU lawand society faculty to serve as the lawand society oral subfield exam commit - tee. T wo of the three oral exam com - mittee members must be NYU GSAS faculty or NYU School of Law facultywith a Ph.D. These faculty assist thestudent in developing an appropriatereading list for the exam. The law andsociety subfield exam is given twice ayear.If students fail, they make take it again but are not permitted to retake itmore than once. The exam is a two-hour oral exam graded as a pass or failby the three selected faculty. A passrequires that two of the three selectedfaculty pass the exam. Students shouldcomplete this exam by the end of thethird year of Ph.D. work. Dissertation :After the dissertation chair and two readers approve a disser-tation proposal and the chair submits adissertation proposal acceptance formsigned by the director of graduate stud-ies, the dissertation may be undertaken. Once the completed dissertation is approved by the dissertation chair and two readers, an oral defense form isfiled, and the oral dissertation defense is scheduled. Of the chair and two read- ers, two must be GSAS full-time fac- ulty. The completed dissertation isdefended in a two-hour oral defense before a five-member committee con-sisting of the dissertation chair, the two readers, and two additional members.Of the five members, three must befull-time GSAS faculty. Any disserta-tion members that are not full-timeGSAS faculty must be approved by thevice dean at least four months prior tothe defense. A successful defense requires that four of the five members of the dissertation committee vote toapprove the dissertation. For rules con- cerning time to degree, refer to the GSAS Policies and Procedures Manual. DUAL JURIS DOCTOR AND DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY Students with a special interest in law may wish to pursue the dual degreeprogram leading to the J.D. and Ph.D.degrees. Students who wish to enroll inthe dual degree program must applyseparately to the School of Law and tothe Graduate School of Arts andScience (GSAS). Students may apply toboth schools simultaneously or to oneschool while in the first year of study atthe other .There are no specific admis - sion standards or applications for dualdegree applicants at either school. Onceadmitted to both schools, the studentqualifies for the dual degree program. General Degree Requirements :The School of Law requires the completionof 82 credits in six semesters of full-time study for the J.D. degree. Full-time study is defined as 12 or more credit hours per semester, primarily in courses commencing prior to 6 p.m.One semester of full-time graduatestudy ,or up to 12 credits, from the Graduate School of Arts and Science is counted toward the J.D. degree. Thus,at least one of the student's semesters inGSAS must be full-time and consist ofamajority of credits in daytime courses. For a complete description of coursesrequired for the J.D. degree, consultthe School of Law Bulletin .The Ph.D. degree requires 72 credits of graduatestudy with a cumulative GPA of B(3.0) or better, of which 12 credits areaccepted from the School of Law. Thetwo degrees therefore require a total of130 credits (70 at the School of Lawand 60 at the Graduate School of Artsand Science). Because some of the cred-its earned in each program are counted toward the other degree, it is possible tocomplete the course requirements for both degrees in five years of full-timestudy. Students pursuing the dual degree program typically spend their first year in the Graduate School of Arts and Science, the second year in theSchool of Law, alternating years until the requirements for both schools aresatisfied. Students may also take up to a maximum of 24 credits in reading andresearch. Students may petition for alimited number of law and societygraduate courses taken elsewhere to betransferred and credited toward thePh.D. degree requirements, but onlyafter completing three courses at New York University. Only relevant law and society courses approved by the directorof graduate studies and GSAS may be transferred.

The Sociolegal Seminar G62.1001 (Law and Society)/L06.3570 (Law) Kornhauser. This seminar (1) surveys approaches for understanding the relationshipbetween social and legal thought and(2) examines their methodologies.Readings examine the extent to which social science and law have common theoretical and methodological foun - dations. Focus is on analytical, doctri - nal, institutional, and philosophical perspectives and approaches to thestudy of law and society. The interfacebetween legal and social, cultural, eco-nomic, and political phenomena isstudied through critical debates aswell as from a historical and compara - tive perspective. Law and Social Policy G62.1002 (Law and Society)/G93.3534(Sociology)/L06.3580 (Law) Dixon. Scholars have debated for centuries the relationship between law and socialpolicy and whether law leads or fol - lows social change. Regardless of one' s position on these issues, most agree that law and society are interwovensuch that law constitutes a field wheresocial policies are created, reinforced,and transformed. This course utilizesthe lens of the courts to examine the relationship between law, social poli-cies, and social change. The first part ofthe course analyzes how social policiesare created, reinforced, and transformedin constitutional courts. Students beginby examining the consequences of U.S. Supreme Court decisions in both creat- ing and eliminating race and gender segregation. Next, they explore therole of constitutional courts in trans-forming social welfare polices in transi- tional societies such as postcommunist Central Europe. The second part of thecourse analyzes how social policies arecreated, reinforced, and transformed intrial courts. Students consider the rela- tionship between social policy and the transformation of criminal courts inthe progressive era; they then investi-gate this relationship in the contempo-rary context. In particular, therelationship between social policies andcurrent criminal court transformationsinvolving plea bar gaining, sentencing guidelines, and the recent creation ofproblem-solving, specialized drug anddomestic violence courts is explored.The third and final part of the courseexamines how social policies are cre-ated, reinforced, and transformed ininternational courts. In particular ,stu- dents explore human rights policiesand the development of theInternational Criminal Court. Introduction to Legal Philosophy G62.1003 (Law and Society)/L06.3005 (Law) Murphy. Survey of 20th-century contributions to legal philosophy. In addition to thecentral debate between H. L. A. Hart and Ronald Dworkin over the concept of law, students discuss natural lawtheory, legal realism, critical legalstudies, feminist jurisprudence, criticalrace theory, and some aspects of post-modern legal theory. The coursebegins with an introduction to themethods of moral and political theory. Sociology of Law G62.1103 (Law and Society)/G93.2434 (Sociology) Dixon, Garland, Greenberg. Designed to provide a broad theoreti- cal framework for analyzing and inter-preting the interrelationships betweenlaw, politics, and society. This coursebegins with a consideration of theintellectual and methodological differ-ences between law and social science;it then examines the interface betweenlaw and social science from two per-spectives. First, the relationshipbetween law and society is traced fromthe point of view of the influence ofnorms and customs, social structure, and class and power on the develop-ment, form procedure, and substanceof law. Second, the impact of law onsociety is examined in the areas ofrights and social movements, race dis-crimination, gender discrimination, and crime and justice. Critical race theory and critical gender theory receive special attention here. A sec-tion on law, courts, and the adminis-tration of justice examines the institutional structure and transforma- tion of the American legal and judicialsystem, and a final section on the legalprofession, legal education, and criticallegal theory deals with the contradic- tory role of lawyers as agents of the status quo and of social change. Seminar in the Sociology of Law G93.3534 (Sociology) Dixon, Garland, Greenberg. This course is designed to allow stu - dents to conduct research on a topiccovered in G62.1103. Students arerequired to enter the course with awell-formulated research proposal. Law and Modern Society G62.1004 (Law and Society)/L06.3560 (Law) Garland. This seminar explores the changing forms and functions of law in modernsociety and the sociological theoriesthat seek to interpret these develop - ments. The concept of modernityforms the background for the first halfof the course, in which the work of Durkheim, Marx, and Weber are reviewed in some detail. Thereafter theclass addresses a body of work, by writers such as Foucault, Selznick, and Teubner, that argues that the characterof modern law\u2014and modern society\u2014is changing in ways that require us torevise our understanding of the rela-tionship of \"law\" to \"society.\" Themesinclude the decline of the rule of law;the emergence of responsive or reflex-ive law; law in the welfare state; laws,norms, and discipline; the relationbetween law and other systems of reg-ulation; and the idea of postmodernityas it applies to the legal sphere. Thecourse does not presuppose any priorknowledge of social theory. Classic Sociological Theory G93.2111 (Sociology) Garland, Lukes. Examines major figures of modern sociology, including Marx, Durkheim,Weber, Simmel, Mead, Freud, andParsons. Focuses on the conditions andassumptions of social theory, the 232 LAW AND SOCIETYprocess of concept formation and the- ory building, general methodological issues, and the present relevance of theauthors examined. An effort is made to speculate on the nature of the growth ofknowledge in sociology. Advanced Theory Seminar: Foucault G62.1010 (Law and Society)/G93.3112 (Sociology) Garland. This seminar is concerned with devel- oping an in-depth understanding of the work of Michel Foucault and its implications for social and historicalresearch. The class studies several of his substantive historical studies ( Discipline and Punish, Madness and Civilization, The Birth of the Clinic, and The History of Sexuality) and explores key concepts in Foucault's work, such as archaeology and genealogy, power/ knowledge, governmentality ,and sub - jectification. Critical responses to Foucault's work are discussed, as are attempts by other authors to put Foucaultian concepts to their own use. Law, Culture, and Power G62.1012 (Law and Society)/G14.3391(Anthropology)/L06.3701 (Law) Merry. Anthropologists view law as basic to social life but highly variable in differ - ent cultural and historical contexts.This course examines theoretical andmethodological issues in legal anthro - pology ,looking at some of the classics in the field as well as contemporary work concerning the cultural dimen - sions of law and their relationship to forms of power and governmentality. It focuses on ethnographic methods forstudying law and legal institutions. The first part of the course examines early work that grappled with thequestion of defining law in contextsthat lacked formal legal systems. Thesecond part explores legal pluralism,law and the colonial process, law andculture, the relationship between lawand discipline, and law and everyday life. As students read ethnographic studies of everyday legal phenomenon,they discuss how to carry out ethno - graphic research and experiment withmini-research projects. In each of thereadings, students consider ethno - graphic approaches to legal phenom - ena and discuss how each author has done his or her ethnographic researchand the techniques involved. Culture and Disputing G62.1301 (Law and Society)/L06.3500 (Law) Bruner, Chase, Chevigny. Study of various types of dispute reso- lution found in societies ranging from primitive to technocratic as well as variations in disputing models withinagiven society. In order to give theo- retical grounding to the foregoing,selections from texts on anthropology,law, and society and from the work oflegal comparativists are assigned. Thegoal is to obtain a deeper understand- ing of the cultural relativism of legal institutions. Alternative Dispute Resolution L09.3523 (Law) Chase. This course concerns \"alternate\" meth- ods of dispute resolution. By this is meant the processes used to resolve disputes that are different from, and therefore alternative to, formal civillitigation. These \"alternate\" processesinclude arbitration, mediation, and negotiation. This course focuses on the legal rules that regulate the use andmethodology of these processes. It alsoexplores the policy justifications andthe problems that are raised by thesealternatives: To what extent should such alternatives be permitted, encour- aged, or required by government?Further ,the course tries to understand the social forces that further or impede their adoption. Language and Problem Solving: The Legal Process and Narrated Self G14.1702 (Anthropology) Schieffelin. Analysis of language as a particular type of problem-solving activity. Viewslanguage as a significant form of social action and, as such, as a resource for participants and researchers. Groundingthemselves in comparative materials,theories, and methodologies drawnfrom the literature on comparativestudies of dispute resolution, symbolicinteraction, political economy of lan-guage, narrative, and the \"narrated self,\" students explore how two speech genres\u2014disputing and narrating\u2014come together in the context of smallclaims court, an important legal insti - tution in contemporary American soci - ety.This course introduces students to research in the ethnography of speak - ing, pragmatics, conversation analysis, narrative analysis, and interpretive sociolinguistics.Politics of the Legal Order G62.1101 (Law and Society)/ G53.2355 (Politics) Harrington. The role of law in politics. Overview of approaches that shape the theoreti- cal and empirical contours of the pub- lic law field and contribute tomultidisciplinary law and social sci- ence studies. Examines institutional,judicial behavior, legal impact, disputeprocessing, ideological, and neoinsti-tutional approaches. Studies multidis-ciplinary political movements and debates, such as liberal legalism, legal realism, legal pluralism, law and soci-ety, law and economics, feminist jurisprudence, critical legal race the- ory,and interpretive sociolegal theory. Focus is on legal and political develop-ment, legal institutions, judicial poli- tics, litigation, and legal-political mobilization. The object is to investi- gate both the politics of law and thelaw of politics. State, Law, and Politics in Society G62.1102 (Law and Society)/L06.3565 (Law)/G53.2356 (Politics) Chevigny, Harrington. Examines the relationship between law and the state by asking whether and how law is autonomous from the political powers of the state. Studiesthe institutional powers of the legalprofession and the judiciary, doctrinal,and legal rights. Examines sociolegaltheories of interpretation. Investigatesthe ideology of law in legal formalism, both contemporary and in the past; law and society; and critical legalstudies. The American Constitution G53.2350 (Politics) Randall. Analysis of the political, social, eco - nomic, cultural, and legal circum - stances surrounding the great conflicts in American constitutional develop-ment. Particular attention is given tohow those conditions and eventsaffected and were affected by theConstitution and its interpretation, in historical context and in American political thinking. The American judi-cial tradition and its discontents areexplored through the work of individ - ual justices of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court and the Constitution G53.2359 (Politics) Randall. Examines the third branch of govern- ment as chief interpreter of theConstitution and reviewer of the workof government. The structure, proce - dures, personnel, and informal or gani-LAW AND SOCIETY 233zation of the Court are considered along with the appointment process. Some attention is given to the impact of the Court's decisions and to publicopinion about the Court. Emphasis is on the Court's political role in a demo- cratic polity. Current Constitutional Issues G62.1201 (Law and Society)/ L01.3536.01 (Law) Bell. Students learn best by doing, that is, by active participation in the subjectmatter. Using simulation models, stu-dents perform the functions of bothjustices of the U.S. Supreme Court andattorneys handling litigation beforethat Court. By simulating the Court's perspective, on the litigation in which it grants or denies remedies, studentsbetter understand the often opaque reasoning the Court provides in adopt- ing or rejecting principles, doctrines,and standards. This structure enablesparticipants to gain a good under - standing of how factors, neither stated nor even recognized, can influence thejudicial process. Constitutional Theory of Emergency Powers L01.3533 (Law) Ferejohn, Pasquino. The seminar discusses from a historical perspective models of constitutionaliza-tion of emergency power, specifically: the Roman dictatorship; Machiavelli, Rousseau, and the revival of the consti-tutional emer gency power in the repub king' the \"veil onliberty ,\" and the \"suspension\" of the constitution during the French Revolution (the Revolutionary govern- ment); Lincoln and the suspension ofhabeas corpus during the AmericanCivil War; Carl Schmitt and the Diktatur gewalt of Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution; De Gaulle and Article 16 of the constitution theFrench Fifth Republic; Article 115a ofthe Bonner Grundgesetz; emergencypower Israel, Northern Ireland,and Latin America. The seminar consid-ers, moreover ,the recent American debate: Guantanamo and after. State and Local Government G62.1105 (Law and Society)/L01.3016 (Law) Jacobs, V iteritti. Explores the power that state and local governments have to regulate, providepublic services, redistribute wealth,spend, finance private projects, tax, andborrow, and ways in which law tries tokeep that power accountable. Some ofthe doctrinal issues considered includeconflicts between state and localauthority, controls imposed as condi- tions on federal or state grants, limits onborrowing and deficit spending, direct democracy, nondiscriminatoryaccess to services, and local government liability for damages for violations of civil rights and antitrust law. Seminar in Labor Law Theory G62.1026 (Law and Society)/L07.3560 (Law) Estreicher. Theoretical perspectives in the study of labor and employment law.

Law and Economics G62.1024 (Law and Society)/L06.3020 (Law) Kornhauser. The first part of this course is a survey of intermediate microeconomic theory, with an emphasis on welfare econom-ics. It provides a framework for thesecond part of the course, which is aneconomic analysis of tort and propertyrules and consideration of similarproblems in law and economics. Voting, Game Theory, and the Law G62.1025 (Law and Society)/L06.3035 (Law) Beno\u00eet. This course first addresses the proper- ties of various voting methods and pro - cedures. It considers desirableproperties that a voting method mightpossess and determines which methods,if any ,have these properties. The ideas developed are used to analyze practical problems, such as voting in union elec-tions and the provision of minorityrepresentation within the context of the V oting Rights Act. Next, the course considers the concept of power and examines the distribution of poweramong voters in different states andwithin voting bodies, such as theUnited Nations Security Council andcongressional committees. Finally, thecourse develops concepts related tostrategic thinking used in game theoryand applies these concepts to votingsituations and legal problems. Law and Social Science G62.1403 (Law and Society)/L06.3008 (Law) Tyler. Introduction to the interface between law and the social sciences. Exploresthe use of social science research find-ings in a variety of areas of the law.These areas include jury decision mak - ing; the use of profiles in identifyingsuspects; evidence such as lie detec- tors, eyewitnesses, and repressed underlyingconstitutional law; with the law and legal authori- ties; and a variety of other topics. Justice and Authority in Groups G62.1029 (Law and Society)/ G89.3404 (Psychology) Tyler. Introduction to psychological research on social justice. Three areas of justiceare considered: distributive justice,procedural justice, and impact of people' sassess- ments of the fairness of the distribu-tion of resources or opportunities within groups, or ganizations, or soci- eties. Procedural justice examines the importance of judgments about the fairness of decision-making proce-dures. Retributive justice explorespeople' sviews about fair ways to pun - ish those who break social rules. Emphasis is on reading and discussingrecent theoretical and empirical writ-ings on these topics. American Legal History G62.1202 (Law and Society)/L06.3010 (Law) Reid. Beginning with the colonial period and emphasizing the 19th century, this course covers the formative era of American law in early MassachusettsBay; the constitutional controversyleading to the American Revolution;the growth of law in the early repub - lic; the law of the clan and of theblood feud among the Cherokees; the American law of slavery; and the fugi- tive slave controversy.

Students are asked to submit two-page evalua - tions of works read. Seminar in Sociology of Law: Gender Politics and Law G62.1021 (Law and Society)/G93.3534(Sociology) Dixon. More than statutes, rules, and court cases, law constitutes a discursive fieldwhere structured inequalities and234 LAW AND SOCIETYshared cultural understandings are defined, reinforced, and transformed. This course focuses on the develop- ment and changes in U.S. legal dis- courses and how these debates produce the context for the development, administration, and interpretation ofgender relations. Students explore thehistorical development of the liberallegal system in the United States as itrelates to gender as well as critiques ofliberal legalism from the standpoint oflegal realism, critical legal theory, andliterary criticism. In addition, students examine legal debates in various sub- stantive areas, such as constitutionallaw, abortion, reproduction, homosex- uality, domestic and sexual violence, employment discrimination, divorce,and custody. Gender Issues in Law and Culture G62.1028 (Law and Society)/L06.3567 (Law) Bruner, Gilligan, Richards. This seminar explores, from both a historical and contemporary perspec - tive, the role of various interpretiveperspectives on gender in law and cul-ture as tools for the understanding,diagnosis, and remedy of racism andsexism as interlinked evils that afflictboth men and women, heterosexualsand homosexuals. Its central topic isthe terms of the struggle to introduce unconventional, gender-subversive voices and topics into public dis-course, criticizing cultural racism, sex - ism, and homophobia. Race and Legal Scholarship G62.1022 (Law and Society)/L06.3545 (Law) Caldwell. This seminar considers how concepts of prejudice and theoretical work on the operation of racial ideology affect developments in the law concerningthe protection against racial discrimi-nation afforded by specific constitu - tional and statutory laws as well as interpretations of the impact of racegenerally in other substantive legalareas. Recent developments in thestudy of race in the social sciences areconsidered. Students examine contem-porary problems in race relations inlight of the theoretical foundations ofclassical legal scholarship, law andeconomics, critical legal scholarship, and the emer ging critical scholarship on race\u2014much, but not all, of which is written by legal scholars of color. Race, Values, and the American Legal Process G62.1023 (Law and Society)/L06.3512 (Law) Higgenbotham Jr. This seminar examines the use of the law to both perpetuate and eradicate racial injustice in the United Statesfrom the inception and rise of slaveryduring the colonial period through theU.S. Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954. The major institutions studied are thecourts and the legislatures (predomi-nantly at the colony or state level). The course explores both criminal and civil law and focuses particularly on theirrole in the preclusion or allowance of traditional family relations, education options, due process in the courts, andother \"rights\" for blacks. Large-Scale Organizations G62.1104 (Law and Society)/ G93.2132 (Sociology) Dixon, Guthrie. Introduction to the rapidly changing field of lar ge-scale organizations. Begins by locating the field at theintersection of various social sciencedisciplines as well as business manage - ment, public administration, the anar - chist theory of or ganization, Marxism, and critical theory. Major organiza- tional theories and approaches discussedinclude W eber,scientific management, human relations, decision theory and systems models, contingency theory,resource-dependence and strategicchoice, institutionalism, populationecology, and the phenomenology oforganizations. After considering various methods of or ganizational analysis, the course focuses on a number of organiza-tional environments, with particularemphasis on the political economy ,the policy networks of the state, and the transformation of the judiciary and thecourts. Finally, certain dimensions ofinternal structure and change are dis - cussed, particularly or ganizational con- trol structures from markets andhierarchies to technocratic corporatismand democratic participation. Law and Literature L06.3510 (Law) Gillers, Stimpson. How does literature use law as a source of structure and theme? Howdoes literature view law and legal institutions? What can literature and literary imagination bring to the per - formance of legal tasks, including \"telling stories\" about cases? Whatdifferent similar) critics employin construing a text? How are humanpassions and the human condition dif -ferently described and treated in law and literature? Criminology G62.2021 (Law and Society)/G93.2503 (Sociology) Dixon, Garland, Greenberg. This course provides a critical evalua- tion of the historical development ofthe study of crime. The readings offeravariety of theoretical and method- ological approaches to the analysis ofvarious areas of crime (violent\u2014prop-erty\u2014victimless\u2014white collar). Theclass provides a forum for critically discussing the variety of theoretical frameworks, issues, research method-ologies, and findings used in examin- ing the construction, violation, and punishment of crime. Seminar in Criminology G93.3513 (Sociology) Dixon, Garland, Greenberg. This course is designed to allow stu- dents to conduct research on a topiccovered in G62.2021. Students are required to enter the course with a well-formulated research proposal. Juvenile Justice L04.3019 (Law) Jacobs. This course covers the full range of criminal procedures applicable to juve-niles: searches and seizures, pretrialinterrogation, confidentiality ,diver - son, pretrial detention, transfer to adult court, right to counsel, sentenc-ing, conditions of confinement, etc. Inaddition, the casebook is augmentedwith some materials on juvenile crime,juvenile criminal records, and the han - dling of juvenile offenders in othercountries.

The Sociology of Punishment G62.1020 (Law and Society)/ G93.2508 (Sociology) Garland. This seminar discusses the literature of the sociology of punishment and thevarious theoretical traditions throughwhich the institutions of penality havebeen understood. It is particularlyconcerned with developing a sociologi -LAW AND SOCIETY 235cal account of contemporary patterns of penal practice in the United States and elsewhere. Criminal Sanctions G62.2022 (Law and Society)/L04.3525 (Law) Garland. This seminar examines current issues inthe sentencing and sanctioning of offenders. Using historical, sociologi- cal, and philosophical approaches, itaims to develop a critical understand- ing of contemporary policies and prac-tices of punishment. Readings dealwith policies such as incapacitation,just desserts, expressive justice, andretribution and look at the decisionmaking and practices of the institu - tions that implement them. The aim is to ground normative analysis (as developed by the philosophical litera - ture) in a more empirical knowledge of how penal institutions actually work. Death Penalty G62.2028 (Law and Society)/L06.3577 (Law) Garland. The aim of this seminar is to develop an in-depth analysis of the institutionof capital punishment and to address aseries of questions to which it givesrise. Using historical and sociologicalresearch, the seminar explores how theforms, functions, and social meaningsof capital punishment have changedover time and what social forces havedriven these changes. Thereafter, the course focuses on the modern American death penalty and the specific charac-teristics of the institution that hastaken shape in the post-Furman era. Race, Poverty ,and Criminal Justice G62.2027 (Law and Society)/L04.3512 (Law) Stevenson. Examines the influence of race and vic- tim-offender economic status in theadministration of criminal justice. Conscious and unconscious racism as well as overt and more complicatedmechanisms for creating bias againstthe poor are explored. Students studyracial disparities in charging, discre-tionary judgments in the prosecutionof criminal cases, sentencing, and theformulation of crime policy in theUnited States, and discuss issues of raceand class in criminal case court deci-sions. Students assess the effectivenessof antidiscrimination law in the crimeand punishment area and review dataand empirical studies on a variety ofissues that impact the poor and peopleof color in the criminal justice system.Particular attention is paid to the roleof legislators, prosecutors, state andfederal judges, defense attorneys, andjurors, and litigation and other reformstrategies aimed at bias against racial minorities and the poor are discussed. Policing in Democratic Societies G62.2023 (Law and Society)/L04.3533 (Law) Skolnick. What are the origins of democratic policing? How are police organized,and how do they function? Why do law enforcement officials act the waythey do, in patrolling, searching, seiz- ing, interrogating? What are the occa-sions, explanations, and remedies forpolice brutality, corruption, and per-jury? What kinds of rules, organiza-tions, and institutions are appropriateand effective for maintaining policeaccountability in a democratic society? Although students discuss some con- stitutional cases, this is not a system - atic seminar in the doctrine of police practices. Rather, the focus is on the history, sociology, and politics of thepolice. Police accountability throughpolitics and law is a major concern. Gun Control G62.2025 (Law and Society)/L04.3525 (Law) Jacobs, Noble. This seminar examines the problem that firearms and other weapons posefor contemporary society and the con-stitutional, statutory, administrative,and court-made laws relating to theregulation of firearms and otherweaponry. Topics include firearms and crime; firearms and self-defense; the Second Amendment as a limitation oncongressional regulation; federalismand the federal role in the regulatingof firearms; the role of the Bureau ofAlcohol, T obacco, and Firearms; the conflict between state and local gov - ernment in regulating firearms; crimi- nal law issues (including aggravatedoffenses, prophylactic offenses, andpresumptions); sentencing law issues (bootstrapping and other enhance - ments for crimes committed with firearms); the prohibition and regula-tion of subcategories of firearms (e.g.,\"Saturday night specials\" and \"assaultrifles\"); products liability and guncontrol; controls on ammunition; con-trols on less lethal weaponry (knives,mace, and brass knuckles); and con-trols on more lethal weaponry (explo-sives and military weapons). Regulation of V ice G62.2024 (Law and Society)/L04.3559 (Law) Skolnick. What is vice and how does it differ from crime? If we criminalize it, canwe regulate it? And if we decriminal-ize it, how shall we regulate it? Thisseminar discusses a range of \"vices\"and regulatory strategies that mightbe applied. Because students need to know much about the nature of the \"vice\" in order to sensibly discuss pol- icy options, there is considerable read-ing, some of it required, others recommended. Corruption and Corruption Control G62.2026 (Law and Society)/L04.3510 (Law) Goldstock. This seminar examines the pervasive problem of official corruption and thevarious bodies of law and legal institu-tions that exist to prevent, detect, andpunish corruption. Topics includebribery and antigratuity statutes; thefederal role in investigating and prose - cuting state and local corruption under the Hobbes Act and mail statutes; conflict of interest and financial disclo - sure laws; government contracting; enforcement strate - gies and sanctions. Deviance and Social Control G62.2020 (Law and Society)/ G93.2160 (Sociology) Dixon, Duster, Greenberg, Horowitz. Broad, introductory course in the sociol- ogy of deviance and social control.Students read and analyze classical andcontemporary texts representing differ- ent theoretical and research traditions, dealing with the designation of sometypes of behavior and conditions asdeviant; ideologies and methods ofsocial control; the etiology of deviance;deviant subcultures; and the politics ofdeviance. An attempt is made to exam - ine a wide range of normative viola- tions, such as crime, mental illness,witchcraft, scientific deviance, alcoholand drug use, and various types of sex- ual deviance. Health Law G62.2002 (Law and Society)/L13.3525 (Law) Law. Considers how the law influences the availability, quality, and cost of med-ical care, and demands a sophisticatedunderstanding of many bodies of law , including the Constitution; state and federal administrative law; the regula-tion of insurance; the Byzantinestatutes defining benefit and regula - tory programs; tort principles of duty , consent, confidentiality ,and malprac - tice; corporate law (profit and not-for - profit); labor law; tax law; and more.However, the focus is not primarilylegal. Rather, the effort is to grapplewith defining life experiences and toexplore the political, philosophical,236 LAW AND SOCIETYand personal values that shape these experiences. Statutes, regulations, andjudicial decisions are primary sourcematerials, but these are placed in anempirical policy context. Empirical Issues in Land Use and Environmental Law G62.2004 (Law and Society)/L10.3501 (Law) Been. This seminar explores the empirical assumptions that underlie leading the- oretical justifications for variousaspects of land use and environmentallaw, survey and critique existingempirical evidence bearing upon thoseassumptions, and formulate researchplans for further tests of the assump-tions. Particular attention is given tothe empirical bases for various theoriesregarding when compensation shouldbe paid for environmental and landuse restrictions imposed upon prop-erty. The course does not assume sta-tistical or econometric knowledge, nor are students asked to conduct statisti- cal tests. Instead, the emphasis is onlearning to identify often hiddenempirical assumptions, gaining rudi - mentary understanding of empiricalmethodologies, and developing anability to formulate research questionsfor persons (such as expert witnesses)who do have the econometric skillsnecessary to actually execute the stud - ies. Students prepare short critiques ofexisting empirical studies and presentaproposal for an empirical study. Students who wish to use the seminarfor a part A paper may use the pro - posal as the springboard for a longer analysis. The seminar lays the ground - work for developing a clinic in which students provide empirical analysesnecessary for informed land use andenvironmental policy discussions.Although a background in land use orenvironmental law is not an absoluteprerequisite, some familiarity with atleast one of those areas is desirable. Land Use, Housing, and Community Development in NewYork City G62.1106 (Law and Society)/L10.3506 (Law) Schill, Upham. Overview of the theory and practice of urban development in low- and mod-erate-income neighborhoods. Focus ison three specific subject areas: landuse, housing, and community develop-ment. Begins with background read-ings on the growth of cities and urbaneconomies, the interaction of demo-graphics and markets, and the legalframework of local government in general. Then looks in detail at a seriesofcase studies selected to illustrate the fundamental legal, political, and eco-nomic issues in land use and housing.The primary goal for the seminar isthe familiarization of the studentswith the legal and political frame-works within which development takes place in low- and moderate- income neighborhoods in New York City. A second goal is the explicationinseveral concrete settings of the rela- tionship between legal doctrine\u2014thepresentations of \"legal frameworks\"that begin the seminar and each casestudy\u2014and what actually results fromthe interaction of legal, political, andeconomic forces. A third goal is thetraining of students in empirical field-work and sociolegal methodology.Fieldwork reports provide an opportu-nity for students to integrate empiricalinvestigation with theory building. Sex Discrimination Law G62.2006 (Law and Society)/L08.3508 (Law) Ellis, Goldscheid. Taught by feminist practitioners, this course seeks to integrate feminist the - ory with the practice of women'srights law by examining a wide rangeof contemporary women' srights legal issues. Beginning with the develop - ment of constitutional protection for gender discrimination, the courseexamines topics such as reproductiverights, educational equity, violenceagainst women, employment, and gen-der bias in the courts, with attentionto how women' srights concerns inter - sect with issues of race, class, and sex - ual orientation. The course discusses how litigation, public policy, and leg-islative strategies have and can be usedto achieve feminist visions of equality. Sexuality and the Law G62.2007 (Law and Society)/L08.3509 (Law) Ettelbrick. Begins with the development of con - stitutional, medical, and theoretical constructions of sexuality. The questionof how state regulations and legalanalysis promote or reflect certainviews of sexuality, gender, and sexualorientation is central to discussion andstudy. The later part of the courseapplies this background to three spe-cific institutional contexts in which thesocial rules of sexuality and gender arechallenged and charged through thelegal process: the military, marriageand the family, and the workplace.Intimate and Family Violence L08.3501 (Law) Mills. Lawyers and social workers are often unprepared for the unique emotional,legal, and cultural challenges posed byworking with survivors of intimateabuse. In part, the tension lies between the public feminist discourse ondomestic violence and the individ- ual realities of battered women's lives.Drawing on legal and related social work research and methods, this inter-disciplinary course for law and socialwork students explores how to recon-cile cultural, political, mental health,and safety concerns as they arereflected in the movement to addressdomestic violence. Using empiricalstudies as a platform for exploringdiverse approaches to working withbattered women, their batterers, andtheir children, this course develops amethod that lawyers and social work-ers can use to traverse such issues as the batterer's recidivism and the vic- tim'sautonomy. Developing a critique of feminist theory from the survivor' s point of view is key to improvingexisting strategies for addressingdomestic abuse. Rights of the Mentally Disabled G62.2008 (Law and Society)/L08.3535 (Law) Levy. Study of the delicate balance between government benevolence and individ-ual autonomy. This seminar considersthe rights of persons with mental dis - abilities in institutional and commu - nity settings and explores issues involving psychiatric expertise, invol - untary commitment, the right to treatment, the right to refuse treat-ment, discrimination, the rights ofnewborns with mental disabilities (the\"Baby Doe\" cases) and medical deci-sion making for incompetent persons(Cruzan, et. al.). Students examine thedevelopment of case law and statutesand the social policies underlyingthem, analyze briefs and transcriptsfrom selected cases, and attend a com-mitment hearing. Free Speech, Censorship, and Culture G62.1204 (Law and Society)/L01.3502 (Law) Adler. Examines the law of free speech and censorship from an interdisciplinaryperspective. Explores the followingquestions: What are the roots of theimpulse to censor? What culturalassumptions are embedded in FirstAmendment law and theory? Howdoes censorship law reflect or reinforce cultural anxieties about certain sub-LAW AND SOCIETY 237jects, such as gender and class, and about certain forms of expression, suchas technology and art? In what waysdoes censorship law shape literature,art, and popular culture? Readingsinclude First Amendment case law andtheory as well as selections from other disciplines Comparative Law and Social Change G62.3001 (Law and Society)/ G93.3534 (Sociology) Garland. This seminar explores the historical and structural interrelationships betweenlaw, politics, and economy in theUnited States and Europe in the 20thcentury. Starting with the theories ofMarx and Weber and the historical work of Horwitz, Hurot, Merryman, and Tigar and Levy, the focus is on theanalysis of 20th-century developments such as legal realism, the legal process approach, feminist jurisprudence, criti-cal legal studies, and the economicanalysis of law .Parallel jurisprudential movements are analyzed for Europe(e.g., the work of the early critical legaltheorists Fraenkel, Kirchheimer ,and Neumann and the theories of Luhmann, Teubner, and Habermas). Concludes with an inquiry into the underpinningsof state socialist, fascist, and postsocial - ist legal systems. History and Theory of International Law L06.3539 (Law) Kingsbury. This course explores the intellectual foundations of contemporary interna-tional law .The aim is to embed think - ing about international law in wider bodies of political and legal theory . The course considers the competingapproaches to international order developed by Grotius, Pufendorf, Hobbes, and some of their modernsuccessors, including fundamental con - cepts of sovereignty ,anarchy ,and soci- ety,and rights and law in international relations; the approaches to imperial - ism and colonial expansion taken by Vitoria, Gentili, Locke, and 19th-cen-tury British liberals, and the interac-tion of international law with colonialand postcolonial projects; the vitalityof alternative models of internationalorder and alternative histories of inter - national law; the theoretical underpin - nings of the positivist-progressivist mainstream of international law in the20th century, with a particular focuson Oppenheim and on the relations oflaw to power; the imagination andproblems of international law as law and as a discipline and of the roles of international lawyers. Indigenous Peoples in International Law L05.3547 (Law) Kingsbury. Issues concerning indigenous peoples (including descendants of precolonialinhabitants in the Americas andAustralasia and groups in Asia andelsewhere) are increasingly significant in many countries and in the United Nations, the World Bank, the Organization of American States, and other international institutions. This seminar discusses challenges to thestandard liberal concepts and to demo-cratic theory posed by such issues asthe meaning and problems of the con-cept of indigenous rights; the natureand meaning of the right to self-deter-mination (including native peoples' self-determination if Quebec secedes from Canada and important develop-ments in indigenous peoples' rights in Latin American states); tensions between individual rights and grouprights (e.g., in discriminatory member-ship rules); minority rights environ-mental law; under international trade andintellectual property regimes. Children' sRights in International Law L05.3563 (Law) Alston. This seminar focuses on the evolution of children' shuman rights within the context of international law and theextent to which they have influencedthe content and institutional arrange-ments for the promotion of humanrights. The Unites Nations conventionon the Rights of the Child, the mostwidely ratified human rights treaty inhistory, provides the framework for discussions. The seminar considers the background drafting of the 1989Convention and ways in which thebroader international law frameworkimpacts upon children. It exploresconceptual dilemmas involved in therecognition of these rights; the contentof the major principles enshrined inthe Convention (notably the principlesof nondiscrimination; the best inter-ests of the child; and children' sright to participate). The focus is on keytopics such as abortion; juvenile jus - tice; sol - diers; intercountry adoption; refugee children; and child sexual exploitation. International Human Rights L05.3034 (Law) Alston. This course provides a general intro- duction to the role of human rights inthe 21st century. It examines the his-torical origins of the concept, its inter-national legal context, and its normative structure. Themes that run throughout the course include cultural relativism, the relationship between rights and duties, the \"public-private\" distinction, and the changing concep-tions of statehood and sovereignty. Thecourse concentrates on the UnitedNations system, dealing with bothcharter-based and treaty-basedarrangements. In order to illustrate thefunctions and processes of institutions, the course looks at issues such as dis- appearances, arbitrary detention,female circumcision, homosexuality, political participation, and democrati- zation. The role of nonstate actors, andcorporations in particular, is examined. War Crimes and International Criminal Courts L05.3552 (Law) Alston. This seminar traces the evolution of International Humanitarian Law fromthe 19th century through Nurembur g to its current application by the inter - national criminal tribunals. Particular emphasis is on aspects of theInternational Criminal Court, whichwill be in the process of being estab-lished as the seminar progresses. JudgeRichard Goldstone of the SouthAfrican Constitutional Court and for - mer prosecutor of the ICTY (International Criminal T ribunal for the former Yugoslavia) will be con-tributing to part of the seminar. Constitutional Justice and Comparative Perspective L01.3528 (Law) Kramer ,Parquino. This course focuses on the decision- making procedures, the type of delib - eration, and the reasons-giving rhetoric of constitutional courts in dif-ferent countries (notably France,Germany, Italy, Spain\u2014other nationalcases are considered according to theinterest, the nationality ,and the lin - guistic competencies of the students). More specifically ,students read and discuss opinions of the courts and ana- lyze the role these institutions play inthe structure of constitutional govern-ments. The origins of judicial reviewand tensions between democraticaccountability and constitutional adju - dication are also discussed.Law and Development L06.3554 (Law) Holmes, Upham. This course examines the various theo- ries of the role that law and legal insti- tutions play in national economic, social, and political development and use empirical evidence from selected countries to critique these theories.Approaches range from neoclassicaleconomics to cultural determinism toinstitutional sociology and include thework of authors like Douglas North,Amartya Sen, Chalmers Johnson, andHernando de Soto. The course consid-ers themes such as the definition of therule of law for developing societies; themeaning of development; the impactand influence of economic globaliza- tion; the role of external organizations such as the World Bank, the WTO(World Trade Organization), or USAID (U.S. Agency for International Development); and the role of factorssuch as culture, history, and race. Race and the Law: The United States and South Africa G62.3003 (Law and Society)/L06.3542 (Law) Higgenbotham Jr. Comparative analysis of the legal process in South Africa and the UnitedStates. Focus is primarily on (1) thepolitical leadership and in-court advo-cacy by lawyers and (2) the similarities and differences in the education laws and cases in South Africa and in theUnited States. Law and Society in Japan G62.3004 (Law and Society)/L05.3006 (Law) Upham. Looks at the interaction of the legal sys- tem and legal institutions withJapanese society, politics, and econom-ics. The goal is to use Japan as a case study of the role that law can play in contemporary advanced democraciesand thereby test current social theory oflaw and society against a non-Westernexperience. Looks closely at several dif-ferent areas of law in Japan, includingenvironmental protection, patients'rights, freedom of religion, civil rightsissues in employment discriminationand affirmative action, criminal proce-dure and police practices, HIV/AIDS,and family law .Readings consist of translated cases, statutes, and othertypes of legal documents, and secondarymaterials. Evaluation is based primarily on a take-home examination/essay, although in particular circumstancespermission is granted to students whowish to write a research paper instead.No particular background is required orrecommended, and students with no previous interest or experience in Japan are welcome. Law and Society in China G62.3005 (Law and Society)/L05.3009 (Law) Cohen, Scogin. Deals with the development of the indigenous Chinese legal tradition,within the context of the Confucian,legalist, and Taoist philosophy; thereform of law in modern China; andthe emerging legal framework for for-eign investment in China. TheConfucian legal tradition is at the coreof the legal cultures of East Asiaincluding Japan, Korea, and much ofSoutheast Asia. The first part of the course serves as an introduction to that tradition. Contemporary China hasseen an effort to create a new legal sys- tem within the context of transform - ing a communist command economyinto a market system. The second partof the course looks at the role of law inthis process from the perspective ofdomestic actors as well as foreigninvestors. Islamic Law and Society G62.3006 (Law and Society)/G77.1852 (MiddleEastern and Islamic Studies)/L05.3560(Law) Haykel. The aim of this seminar is to expose graduate students to a variety of writ- ings in and on Islamic law. The firstreadings consist of introductory sur-veys. These are followed by recentstudies on the theoretical foundations of Islamic law (usul alfiqh). Students then sample some substantive legalmaterial as it is presented in the classi-cal legal manuals. The aim here is togive a sense of the way in whichIslamic law was traditionally presented and how these manuals were then used by scholars. This is followed by anexamination of the methods and formsof transmission of Islamic legal knowl-edge and expertise. Students then lookat a number of studies that depictIslamic law as it was understood, prac-ticed, and enforced. Next, studentslook at the treatment of Islamic juristsof marginals and minorities in theoreti-cal writings as well as historical experi - ence in order to explore how normswere established and enforced and howthose who did not fully fit these wereconceived and treated by the law . Finally, students survey the attempts to reform Islamic law in modern times.Women and Islamic Law G62.3007 (Law and Society)/G77.1854 (Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies) Haykel. Acquaints students with the ways Islamic law has treated women in the- ory and practice. Students are exposed to medieval and modern texts regard- ing the status of women as believers,daughters, wives, mothers, and legalpersons. Case studies from differentperiods of Islamic history as well aswritings from contemporary anthro-pology are read and discussed. Theaim is to examine the ways in whichIslamic law has been variously defined,invoked, implemented, or not imple-mented, in different contexts.Emphasis is on the strategies women have sought to transgress \"the law\" in order to achieve a better outcome forthemselves. In addition, students look at the ways in which modern legisla - tion in the Muslim world has treatedwomen and discuss the debates overtheir rights and identity that havetaken place amongst feminists (bothMuslim and non-Muslim) andIslamists and in international bodiessuch as the United Nations. Comparative Criminal Justice Clinic: Focus on Domestic Violence L02.2504 (Law) Das Dasgupta, Maguigan. Domestic violence occurs everywhere, with different resonances in differentcultures. Every country has a criminaljustice system, but the attempt to usearrest and prosecution as tools against domestic violence is far from universal. Within each nation where domesticviolence is prosecuted, there is debateabout whether a criminal-courtapproach will ever make more than amarginal difference. This debate, examined in a comparative and inter-disciplinary context, is the focus of theweekly seminar. Specific areas ofinquiry include mandatory arrest,prosecutorial discretion, no-drop poli-cies, and mandatory reporting to lawenforcement by health care providers.The main points of comparison areIndia and the United States. Legal Changes After Communism L05.3522 (Law) Holmes. This yearlong seminar focuses on the main issues of postcommunist legaldevelopment, with an emphasis on Russia and the countries of Eastern Europe, including problems of judicialreview ,federalism, separation of powers, legislative oversight, rights enforce - ment, electoral law ,and corruption. 238 LAW AND SOCIETYLAW AND SOCIETY 239Transitional Justice in Times of Transition L05.3536 (Law) Boraine, Van Zyl. This course deals with the historical, political, social and, especially, legalquestions arising from transitions incountries emerging from dictatorshipor authoritarian governments to new forms of democracy. In particular, the emphasis is on how countries deal withtheir past in building a new future. Many countries have experienced graveviolations of human rights, and thecourse examines the various ways ofaddressing these violations. The focusis on tribunals and truth commissions. The course considers the period of the Nurember gTrials until the contempo- rary conflicts in the Balkans. Case Studies in Transitional Justice L05.3540 (Law) Prerequisite: L05.3536. Boraine, V an Zyl. Case studies, historical and contempo - rary, of countries experiencing transi-tion are discussed in this course. Ineach case study ,documents related to the specific country are made availableto the students prior to the class.Examples of some of the countries con-sidered include Peru, East T imor, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Mexico, NorthernIreland, Afghanistan, Burma, andZimbabwe. Students select one casestudy for their semester paper . Topics in Advanced Property G62.3002 (Law and Society)/L10.3537 (Law) DeVita, Upham. This seminar addresses a range of issues in contemporary property law from the perspectives of American,European, and Japanese law. Topics include theories of property, security oftitle, land-use controls, the intergener- ational transfer of wealth, intellectual property, and the role of propertyrights in economic development. Global Public Service Lawyering: Theory and Practice L05.4510 (Law) Maguigan, Upham. This seminar examines the history and theory of public interest lawyeringfrom a global perspective. Topicsinclude the effectiveness of impact liti-gation versus other approaches to social change, the appropriateness of public interest law for non-Western societies,the impact of economic markets on the developing world, the role of interna-tional legal and political norms ondomestic law, and the consideration ofthe role of lawyers and legal institu-tions in addressing these issues. The Empowered Self: Law and Society in the Age of Individualism L06.3551 (Law) Franck. This seminar examines the gradual emancipation of the individual innational and international law ,includ - ing the right to nationality ,religion, choice of career, and name. These andother issues of personal emancipationare studied in the context of variouslegal systems and cultures. The emer g- ing rights pertaining to gender and political participation are discussed byreference to the historic evolution ofhuman rights and civil rights.

The Graduate RecordExamination is required of all applicants. The department has two different degree programs, and applicantsshould specify the degree program forwhich they are applying. The depart-ment's principal degree program is thePh.D. program, for students interestedin a career in research. Most studentsadmitted to the department enroll inthis program. Exceptionally, students may enroll in aterminal M.A. program. A student who is permitted to enroll in the termi-nal M.A. program and who subsequentlywishes to enter the Ph.D. program mustapply to the department for admission tothe latter alongside all new applicants.Acceptance is not automatic. MASTER OF ARTS Astudent enrolled in the terminal M.A. program must select a track inaccordance with the student' sinterests. Upon selecting a track, the studentthen selects an adviser who specializesin that area. Degree Requirements: 1. Satisfactory completion of graduate studies totaling at least 32 points ofapproved courses (at least 24 in resi-dence at New York University). Coursework in a field other than linguisticsmust be approved in advance by the student's adviser. The M.A. program is or ganized by track. Each track has its own courserequirements, which add up to 24 ofthe 32 points required for the M.A.The courses that the student takes forthe remaining 8 points are determinedby the student in consultation with thestudent's adviser. the following:G61.1220, G61.1410, G61.1510, orG61.1830. Any proposed substitution of some other course for a \"track\" course must beapproved both by the student' sadviser and the director of graduate studies. 2. Reasonable proficiency in a foreign language of clear relevance to the stu-dent's research, subject to approval bythe director of graduate studies.Proficiency can be demonstrated eitherby earning a grade of B or better in atleast the fourth term of a college for - eign language course completed notmore than two years before the stu - dent'sadmission to the Graduate School of Arts and Science, or by pass- ing the appropriate Graduate School ofArts and Science foreign language pro - ficiency examination. When profi- ciency is demonstrated in some other way (e.g., when a student presents anunder graduate degree from a foreign university where the language in ques - tion is the medium of instruction for the student's course of study), thedirector of graduate studies may for-ward to GSAS a request for a waiver ofthe foreign language examination. 3. Passing a written examination that should be taken during the term inwhich course work is completed (andmust be taken for the first time nolater than the term following the onein which course work is completed).Students may take the examination asecond time if necessary. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY M.A. Degree Requirements: 1. Satisfactory completion of graduate studies totaling at least 32 points ofapproved courses (at least 24 in resi-dence at New York University), includ- ing G61.1210, G61.1410, G61.1510, or G61.1830. While only one of the last four courses is required for the M.A., allfour of them are required for the Ph.D.Therefore, any of these four courses nottaken for the M.A. should be taken assoon as possible thereafter. Students wishing to specialize in syntax or semantics are required totake G61.2370. Students takingG61.2370 must take it in the semesterimmediately following G61.1340. The department recommends that students wishing to specialize in soci - olinguistics take at least two courses inlinguistic anthropology ,specifically Linguistic Anthropology (G14.1040)and one other from the following:Ethnographic Methods (G14.2700),Identity and Language (G14.3392), or Linguistic Field Methods (G14.3394). The department does not normally transfer credits for previous graduate course work. In exceptional circum- stances, a small number of graduatecredits may be transferred. The studentwill be advised by the director of gradu - ate studies concerning equivalencies.Requests for transfers of credits for par - ticular courses must be made within thestudent's first year in the department. 2. Reasonable proficiency in a foreign language of clear relevance to the stu-dent's research, subject to approval bythe director of graduate studies (DGS).Proficiency can be demonstrated eitherby earning a grade of B or better in atleast the fourth term of a college for - eign language course completed notmore than two years before the stu - dent's admission to the Graduate School of Arts and Science, or by pass-ing the appropriate Graduate School ofArts and Science foreign language pro-ficiency examination.

An article-quality paper in which the student demonstrates the ability tocarry out original research. This is thestudent's first qualifying paper; thePh.D. degree requires a second one. Therules and timetables for the two qualify- ing papers are spelled out together in item 4 of the Ph.D. requirements. Ph.D. Degree Requirements: 1. A Master of Arts degree in linguis- tics, as described above. 2. Completion of 40 points of approved course work beyond the mas-ter's degree, including G61.1340,G61.1410, G61.1510, and G61.1830,if the student has not taken them atthe M.A. level. Students must offer a total of 72 points of course work including work required for the mas-ter'sdegree or its equivalent. 3. In addition to the foreign language requirement for the M.A. degree, thestudent must demonstrate reasonableproficiency in a second foreign lan-guage of clear relevance to the student'sresearch, subject to approval by thedirector of graduate studies. Proficiencycan be demonstrated either by earningagrade of B or better in at least the fourth term of a college foreign lan-guage course completed not more thantwo years before the student's admis-sion to the Graduate School of Arts andScience, or by passing the appropriateGraduate School of Arts and Scienceforeign language proficiency examina - tion. When proficiency is demonstratedin some other way (e.g., when a studentpresents an undergraduate degree fromaforeign university where the language in question is the medium of instruc-tion for the student's course of study),the director of graduate studies mayforward to GSAS a request for a waiverof the foreign language examination. 4. Qualifying papers in two different areas of linguistics. A qualifying paper(QP) is called \"qualifying\" because by itastudent demonstrates that she/he is qualified to do a dissertation. It containsoriginal thought, a command of the lit-erature, sound linguistic analysis andargumentation, and clear presentation. Length of the paper. Each paper must be no more than 50 double-spacedpages in length (tables, charts, spec-trograms, footnotes, and bibliographyincluded).Qualifying-paper committee. Each qualifying-paper committee consists of acommittee chair and two other fac- ulty members. It is the student'sresponsibility to obtain the consent ofthe committee chair and members toparticipate on the committee. The committee should be fully constituted before the beginning of the semester in which work begins on the QP . The timetable for submission. The stu- dent submits the first QP in the fourthsemester of the student's career and the second QP in the fifth semester. If one of the QPs contains an extensive experi-mental or fieldwork component, onesemester is added to that QP's timetable. Thus, if it is the first QP , itis due in the fifth semester (and hence the second QP is due in the sixth semester), while if it is the second QP that adds an extensive experimental/fieldwork component, it is due in thesixth rather than the fifth semester .This alteration of timetable must be agreed upon by the student's adviser, QP com-mittee chair, and the DGS no later thanthe beginning of the semester in whichthe QP would otherwise be due. Proposals. Before undertaking a QP , students must prepare a two-page pro-posal of their QP consisting of anabstract and a reading list. For QPswith extensive experimental or field-work content, this proposal mustinclude a timetable indicating whatwork is to be done and when, extend- ing across both semesters of work. The student is then expected to adhere tothis timetable. For QPs conductedduring the spring semester ,the pro- posals must be delivered to the com-mittee chair in the last week of the fallsemester; for QPs conducted duringthe fall semester, they are due the firstweek of the fall semester. Studentsreceive prompt feedback from the QPcommittee members on the proposal. Deadlines. Asubstantial first draft of the QP must be submitted by thebeginning of the tenth week of springsemester (ordinarily the first week afterthe spring break), or the ninth week offall semester. The student's committeereviews the paper with the studentwithin three weeks of submission. Thisevaluation results in a finding that thepaper is either acceptable, acceptableupon revision, or unacceptable. If thepaper is found to be \"acceptable uponrevision,\" the student has four weeks tocomplete the revisions to the satisfac - tion of the committee. Students are expected to submit acceptable QPs on time. If a student'spaper is either not submitted on time orsubmitted but not deemed acceptable bythe student's committee, or if the stu- dent fails to complete acceptable revi- sions required by the committee within the prescribed time limits, then the stu-dent is placed on academic probation. Ifthe student fails to submit an acceptablepaper in the following semester, then the student is terminated. When a student onacademic probation submits an acceptable QP and returns to goodstanding, the student's QP timetable isadjusted by one semester. However, if astudent is on academic probation for the first QP , he or she may not go on aca- demic probation for nonsubmission,lateness, or unacceptability of the secondQP; instead, the student is terminated. In sum, the first time a student fails tosubmit an acceptable QP on time, the student goes on academic probation; the second time this happens in the course of a student' scareer (whether it is on the first QP or the second), the student isterminated. Probation is regulated by GSAS. Note also that the Graduate School requires completion of qualifyingrequirements for doctoral candidates bythe end of the third year of study ,which means that students must complete and pass both QPs by the end of the thirdyear. Failure to do so is grounds for ter-mination. Therefore, if students take anextra semester for a QP with extensiveexperimental work or field work, thereis no room to also have a semester ofprobation; conversely, if they take an extra semester to complete a QP for which they are placed on probation,there is no room for an extra semester todo experimental work/fieldwork. The M.A. degree for students in the Ph.D. program. When a student' sfirst paper is accepted, the student is eligi- ble for an M.A. degree, provided thatthe student has met the M.A. courseand foreign language requirements. Changing topics. If a student' sfirst submission is not accepted, the student is permitted to change the topic oreven the area of linguistics, providedthat the student's two acceptable quali-fying papers are in two different areasof linguistics. Changing the topic doesnot alter the student's timetable or thestudent' sstatus relative to academic probation or termination. If a studentchanges the topic or area after the firstsubmission is not accepted, the secondsubmission is precisely that, a secondsubmission of the first QP . The relationship of a student' sadvisers to qualifying-paper commit- tees.One of the student's overall advis- ers may additionally function as amember of one or both of the student' s qualifying-paper committees (and asLINGUISTICS 243the chair of one of them). It is, how- ever, not presumed that an adviser will doso, and students are encouraged to involve a wide range of faculty mem-bers in the preparation of their quali- fying papers. 5. Dissertation proposal. After com- pleting the second qualifying paper, the student begins work on a disserta-tion proposal. Once the student selects the area in which she or he wishes towrite a dissertation, the student meetswith her or his potential dissertation adviser and obtains that faculty mem- ber's agreement to serve in that capac-ity. Together the student and the dissertation adviser explore potential topics for the dissertation. Students may incorporate one (or both) of the qualifying papers into thedissertation proposal if appropriate. Similarly, it is fully expected that largesections of the dissertation proposalwill go directly into the dissertation. The timetable for submission. Astudent may hand in a dissertation proposal atany time during the fall semester; dur-ing the spring semester ,the proposal must be handed in by the Monday immediately following spring break. The timetable for completion of the dissertation proposal is sensitive to thetimetable for QPs (above). Specifically,it is sensitive to whether or not one ofthe student's QPs contains extensive empirical content and therefore requires an additional semester to complete. If neither of the student' sQPs con - tains extensive empirical content, the student submits the dissertation proposal during the fourth year .The student's dis- sertation proposal must be submittedand accepted by the end of the firstsemester of the fifth year. If that does not happen, then the student is placed on academic probation the following semes- ter. If the student's proposal is not sub-mitted and accepted in the student's first semester on academic probation (i.e., the second semester of the fifth year), then the student is terminated. Ifone of the student's QPs contains extensive empirical content, the studentsubmits a dissertation proposal during the fourth year or, at the latest, by theend of the first semester of the fifthyear. The student's dissertation proposalmust be submitted and accepted by theend of the fifth year. If that does nothappen, then the student is placed onacademic probation the following semester. If the student's proposal is not submitted and accepted in the student' s first semester on academic probation (i.e., the first semester of the sixth year), then the student is terminated. All students should note that the timetable for completion of the disser - tation proposal is not adjusted for a student who is placed on academicprobation for failure to get a QPaccepted in the semester in which it isdue. Regardless of a student's QP his-tory, the timetable for completion ofthe dissertation proposal is that whichis stated above. Evaluation of the proposal. Once a stu- dent submits a proposal, then the stu- dent' scommittee evaluates it. If the committee finds the proposal accept- able, then the student may proceed towork on the dissertation. If the com - mittee does not find the proposalacceptable, it notifies the student as towhat changes it recommends. The stu - dent may then submit a revised pro- posal in the following semester. Completion of other requirements. Ordinarily, a student whose disserta- tion proposal is accepted has already met the other nondissertation require-ments for the Ph.D. (i.e., the foreign language and course requirements). A student who reaches this level and has not yet met these requirements isencouraged to do so at once. 6.Defense of the dissertation is during afinal oral examination. Full-time status: To qualify for full- time status, Ph.D. students enroll in courses according to the following schedule. The three courses completedin the fourth and fifth years must beseminars; they cannot be reading courses. First Year: fall, 12 points; spring, 12 points. Second Year: fall, 12 points; spring, 8points. Third Year: fall, 8 spring, 8points. Year: 4 points; spring, 4points. Fifth Y ear:4points.

FACULTY EMERITUS James Carse. 254 MIDDLE EASTERN AND ISLAMIC STUDIESAll incoming graduate students are assigned an adviser, with whom theyshould consult regarding course selec - tion. Once they are in a program, stu - dents may change advisers afternotifying the director of graduatestudies. However, departmentalapproval is required for selection of adissertation adviser or change thereof. MASTER OF AR TS Admission: All applicants must sub- mit Graduate Record Examination(GRE) scores; graduates of under grad- uate institutions where instruction is in a language other than English mustalso submit scores from the Test ofEnglish as a Foreign Language(TOEFL) or equivalent. The depart-ment strongly recommends that appli-cants have already acquired proficiencyin Arabic, Persian, or T urkish at the intermediate level or beyond. The department accepts applicants for fall admission only. Course of Study: The Master of Arts degree requires the completion of 32points of course work, no more than 8points of which may be transferred fromother graduate schools. All students must take the following courses:Problems and Methods in MiddleEastern and Islamic Studies (G77.1687);two courses in Middle Eastern history;two other Middle East-related courses;one seminar on a Middle East-relatedtopic; and two language courses at theadvanced level or beyond. Students must also either complete amaster' sthesis that meets depart - mental standards or ,with the approval of their adviser ,submit two seminar papers, at least one of which would contain substantial original researchbased on primary sources and both ofwhich would, in the judgment of thestudent' stwo master' sthesis/papers readers, have been developed and sub - stantially reworked such that they areroughly equivalent in caliber to workthat might reasonably be submittedfor publication in a scholarly journalin the student's field. The master'sthesis or the two papers must be dis-cussed and approved in an oral defensethat will include the two readers andthe student. Requirements for the Master of Arts degree should be met within two yearsof matriculation at New York University. No student who has notyet received the master' sdegree by that time may register for additionalcourse work without departmentalapproval, nor may any student whohas already received the M.A. degreecontinue course work without depart-mental approval. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY Admission: Students already in the department working toward the M.A.degree who want to continue graduatestudy and pursue the Ph.D. degreeshould apply to the department forpermission by the beginning of thesemester in which they will completeall requirements for the M.A. degree.That application should include astatement of research interests, an out-lined plan of study ,and at least three letters of recommendation from NYU faculty. Departmental permission to continue graduate work toward the Ph.D. degree is neither automatic norguaranteed; students to whom thedepartment denies permission to con-tinue graduate study receive the M.A.Programs and Requirementsas their terminal degree, provided they have met all the requirements for thatdegree. Students who already have, or are about to receive, an M.A. degree from another department, program, or uni- versity should apply for admission in accordance with the procedures speci- fied by the Graduate School of Arts and Science. At the department's dis-cretion, students may be granted up to32 points of degree credit for gradu-ate-level course work done elsewhere. Course of Study: Students must com- plete 72 points of graduate coursework, including at least three graduateseminars and Problems and Methodsin Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies(G77.1687), if not already taken. Theymust also demonstrate proficiency ineither Arabic, Persian, or Turkish aswell as a reading knowledge sufficientfor research purposes of at least oneEuropean language. A student may berequired by his or her dissertationadviser to learn additional languages,in keeping with the student's specificresearch needs. As early as possible in their graduate studies, students should choose twomajor fields and begin focusing theirstudies on them. Subject to the availabil - ity of faculty, major fields may include Islamic studies; ancient Egyptian his-tory/language/culture; classical Arabiclanguage and literature; modern Arabic language and literature; Persianlanguage and literature; and Turkish lan-guage and literature. Students primarilyinterested in Middle Eastern history should see below for information aboutthe Joint Ph.D. Program in History and Middle Eastern Studies. By the end of their third year of graduate study, students should havetaken and passed a written compre-hensive examination in each of theirtwo major fields. Students prepare forthese examinations by course work andby working through a reading list foreach field under the supervision of thefaculty member who will examinethem; each examination will have asecond reader as well. Each writtencomprehensive examination will befollowed by an oral examination,administered by the two readers.Students who do not pass a major fieldexamination may petition the depart-ment for permission to take it onemore time. After completing the major field requirements, the student should for-mulate a dissertation proposal, in con - sultation with his or her primary dissertation adviser as well as the fac- ulty members on the student's disser-tation committee. On completion of all course work (including all incom-pletes) and the fulfillment of all lan- guage requirements, the student must successfully defend the dissertation proposal, with the student's adviser and two other faculty members serv- ing as examiners. The completed dissertation must conform to departmental andGraduate School of Arts and Sciencestandards, be read and approved by thestudent's supervisor and two other fac-ulty members, and be defended in apublic oral defense in which thosethree readers and two additional exam-iners participate. JOINT PH.D. PROGRAM IN HISTORY AND MIDDLE EASTERN STUDIES Note: Program requirements are subject to revision; contact the direc - tor of graduate studies for updated information. Admission: Students primarily inter- ested in the history of the Middle Eastshould seek admission to the JointPh.D. Program in History and MiddleEastern Studies, in accordance withthe procedures specified by theDepartments of Middle Eastern andIslamic Studies and History . Admission to the joint program is contingent on outstanding academicperformance and is provisional untilthe completion of all M.A. require - ments and until qualifying examina-tions are taken and passed. Course of Study: Joint Ph.D. stu - dents must complete a total of 72points, including three graduate semi-nars; at least one of those seminarsmust be in a non-Middle Eastern field.Students must demonstrate proficiency in at least one Middle Eastern lan - guage, in accordance with the proce- dures prescribed by the Department ofMiddle Eastern and Islamic Studies, aswell as a reading knowledge of at leastone European language, in accordancewith the procedures prescribed by theDepartment of History. A student maybe required by his or her dissertationadviser to learn additional languages,in keeping with the student's specificresearch needs. Students should begin defining the fields of historical study in which theywish to specialize and concentrate asearly as possible. Joint program stu- dents must also take the methodology course required of all history graduatestudents. Between their second andthird year of full-time study ,students must take and pass a comprehensiveexamination in each of two major fields of history. One field must beMiddle Eastern; the other may be Middle Eastern or one of the other fields defined by the Department of History. Subject to the availability of faculty, Middle Eastern fields may include modern Middle Eastern his- tory (1750-present), early modern Middle Eastern history (1200-1800),and early Islamic history (600-1200);other Middle Eastern history fieldsmay be approved later. Each student'schoice of fields must be approved bythe directors of graduate studies ofboth departments. Both comprehensive examinations are normally taken at the end of thesame semester, but students may peti-tion to take one of their examinationsno later than the end of the followingsemester .Each written comprehensive examination will be followed by an oral examination, administered by thetwo readers. Students who do not passacomprehensive examination may petition for permission to take it onemore time. Students preparing for anexamination in any of the fields forwhich the Department of History pre - scribes \"literature of the field\" courses must take those courses. For MiddleEastern history fields, preparation forexaminations in those fields may bedone in formal \"literature of the field\"courses, if offered, or through readingcourses arranged with faculty .In either case, students prepare for their exami- nations by course work in the fieldand by working through a reading listfor the field under the supervision of the faculty member who will examine them; each examination will have asecond reader as well. After successfully completing his or her comprehensive examinations, thestudent should begin to formulate adissertation proposal, in consultationwith the student's primary dissertationadviser. On completion of all coursework (including all incompletes) andthe fulfillment of all language require - ments, the student must successfullydefend the dissertation proposal, withthe student' sadviser and two other faculty members serving as examiners. The completed dissertation must conform to departmental andGraduate School of Arts and Sciencestandards, be read and approved by thestudent' ssupervisor and two other fac - ulty members, and be defended in a public oral defense in which threereaders and two examiners participate.

Closely examines selected exhibitions held in U.S. museums that haveshaped the definition of \"LatinAmerican art.\" Is the transnationalcategory \"Latin American art\" a prod - uct of survey exhibitions and museumcollecting? If so, how does this affectthe way in which artists works, andthe history of art in individual coun-tries are regarded? Why does \"LatinAmerican art\" get \"rediscovered\" peri-odically ,and what political and eco - nomic developments affect patronage and exhibitions? How has theMuseum of Modern Art in particularplayed a pivotal role in defining LatinAmerican art since it began exhibitingand collecting in the 1930s?Topics in Museum Studies: Anthropology Museums, MuseumAnthropology G49.3330 Geismar. 4points. Examines the history, structure, and social life of anthropology museumsand the study of museums by anthro-pologists, focusing on a broad range ofexamples from the mid-19th centuryto the present. The syllabus traces therole played by museums in developingvarious anthropological paradigms,including evolutionary ethnology,physical fieldwork, cul-tural relativism, natural repa-triation, and postmodernism. Thechallenge is to understand the globalprocesses and politics of buildingethnographic collections, displays, andeducation programs, as well as theshifting role of the anthropologymuseum in the academy and the cul-ture industry. Students examine theemergence of the museum as the cele-brated focus of anthropological teach - ing, its subsequent demise, and thenits reemergence as the subject of ethnography itself. Topics in Museum Studies: Heritage and Memory in HistoryMuseums G49.3330 Williams. 4points. Examines the controversial subject of museums that represent heritage, his - tory,and memory .Considering cases as diverse as Colonial Williamsburg, Mexican American heritage museums,slavery museums in Africa, Holocaustmuseums, and museums of NativeAmerican history, seeks out commonthemes and problems that definemuseum representations of the past.Topics covered include authenticity,race, cultural property, cultural bro- kers, mul- tivocality, photography, contact zones,context, multiculturalism, and com-munity outreach. The objective is toexamine the connections and distinc-tions between the theory and practiceof exhibiting history and to under - stand how material culture, socialprocess, and historical events conver ge in the social production of collections and institutions. The focus is on muse-ums not merely as containers of his-tory,but as social arenas that influence and determine the politics, value, andexperience of the past. Accordingly , students are expected to develop a the - oretical toolkit for contextualizing and addressing controversies in the her-itage industry. 262 MUSEUM STUDIESMUSEUM STUDIES 263Topics in Museum Studies: Cultural Property, Rights, and Museums G49.3330 Geismar. 4 points. What does it mean to own or have a culture? Are all cultures the same? Is owning your culture a basic human right? This course investigates thegrowing discussions about culturalproperty rights that have emerged inthe context of museum practices, from collection and display to conservationand archiving. A general analysis of concepts of culture, property, and rights related to these material and social domains is offset by sessions thatexamine how different understanding of entitlements may be negotiated within museum spaces and howmuseum objects (broadly defined) may be understood as cultural resources. Special focus is on legislation, politicalevents such as war, indigenous rightsmovements, international conceptionsof intellectual and cultural property,and the commodity transaction andthe marketplace, and their impact onmuseum practice. Topics in Museum Studies: The Political Uses of Museums:Diplomacy, Tourism,Governmentality G49.3330 Williams. 4 points In the last two decades, politics appears to have entered the museum asseldom before. This seems to reflect anincreased awareness of key institutions'capacity to make authoritative publicstatements about contested values.Museums increasingly take a stand ondivisive social issues, like culturaldiversity and tolerance, art andobscenity ,science and morality ,and \"difficult histories.\" Exhibitions andprograms foregrounding such topics have an ambiguous relation to govern-ment, the tourist industry ,and visi- tors. While they often paint a lessthan pretty or proud social portrait,they are often financially lucrative. Yetother museums remain steadfastly com-mitted to more idealized visions ofnational progress, scientific and mili - tary prowess, and the artistic canon.The often stark distinction betweenthese ideas about the role of the museum in the public sphere has raised critical questions: Are museums themost suitable places for politicaldebate? What role do\u2014and should\u2014governments, interest groups, and cor - porate sponsors play in this realm? Are museums fighting for the \"hearts andminds\" of local visitors and interna - tional tourists, or merely telling stories? This course considers the political factors that affect museums, includinggovernment cultural policy, diplomaticmissions, funding bodies, tourism organizations, interest groups, interna- tional museum partnerships, and, of course, politicized visitors themselves.Arange of case studies is drawn on, including traveling 9/11 exhibitions,Museums of Tolerance, live indigenous performances, revisionist war exhibi-tions, and art-in-society controversies. Research in Museum Studies G49.3915 1-4 points. Independent research on a topic deter- mined in consultation with the pro- gram director. Development, Fund-Raising, and Grantsmanship G49.2221 Lyons. 4points. Overview of organizational develop- ment principles as they relate to thefund-raising and grantsmanshipprocess. Topics include sources offunding, current trends, and fund-rais-ing techniques, earned income, publicrelations, volunteers, and membership.Includes a practicum in proposal writ-ing and work experience with an artsorganization in program developmentand fund-raising. Museum Conservation and Contemporary Culture G49.2222 Wharton. 4 points. An introduction to heritage conserva - tion combining hands-on experience,museum laboratory visits, and discus-sion of historic preservation in thecontext of contemporary culture. Thisseminar is divided into three broadtopics: museum collections care, the history and philosophy of Western conservation, and the conservation ofmodern and contemporary art. It aimsto provide a technical understandingof artifacts while placing their conser-vation in a broad cultural context. Theseminar addresses concerns of livingartists as well as indigenous groupsand others with claims to the disposi - tion and care of cultural materials. Local Museums, Historic Houses, and Sites G49.2223 Trask. 4points. Restored interiors, structures, and landscapes that function as museumswhether they are period rooms in alarge museum, free-standing historic houses, or entire villages are numerousand popular .What purposes do such assemblages serve in preserving andpresenting our material culture? Students study the history of suchrestorations and the methods used intheir administration. The course is taught through a combination of lec- tures, site visits, and case study reports. Class discussion is a criticalcomponent of all sessions. The courseprepares students to curate, adminis-ter, and interpret a restored interior or historic structure. Museum Education G49.2224 Barsky. 4 points. This seminar provides an overview of the field of museum education in the context of the institution's relationship with constituent communities andwith application to a broad range of audiences. Among the topics consid- ered are teaching from objects, learn-ing strategies, working with docentsand volunteers, program planning, andthe educational use of interactive tech-nologies. Museums and Interactive Technologies G49.2225 Williams. 4points. This course presents a survey and analysis of museum use of interactivetechnologies. Among the topics dis-cussed in detail are strategies and toolsfor collections management, exhibi-tions, educational resources and pro-grams, Web site design, digitizationprojects, and legal issues arising fromthe use of these technologies. Eachstudent develops an interactive projectin an area of special interest. Exhibition Planning and Design G49.3332 Gallagher .4points. This course focuses on the planning, development, and design of exhibi- tions, permanent, temporary, and trav-eling. It is a participatory class wherestudents learn basic exhibition designtechniques, including spatial layoutsand the use of graphics, audiovisualaids, lighting, colors, materials, andfabrication methods. Students gaininsight into exhibition planning anddevelopment and the roles played byvarious museum professionals. Thereare visits to designers to discuss their work and to museums and other ven- ues to analyze exhibition design tech-niques. Individual student projectsprovide hands-on experience. CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Michael Beckerman DIRECTOR OF GRADUATE STUDIES: Associate Professor Suzanne G. Cusick COORDINATOR OF ETHNOMUSICOLOGY: Associate Professor Ana Maria Ochoa Gautier COORDINATOR OF COMPOSITION AND THEORY: Professor Louis Karchin COORDINA TOR OF HISTORICAL MUSICOL OGY: Associate P rofessor Suzanne G. Cusick DIRECT OR OF THE CENTER FOR EARL YMUSIC: Professor S tanle yBoorman he New Y ork University gradu - ate program in music is designed for the professionally minded student who plans a career com-bining college-level teaching with continuing research and/or composition. Students may specialize in historical musicology ,ethnomu - sicology, or composition and theory ,but their research inter - ests are not expected to conform to narrow interpretations of these fields. Indeed, our stu- dents' work addresses a widerange of musical traditions (such as jazz, film music, various \"world,\" \"European art,\" and\"popular\" musics) from a variety of critical, analytical, ethno - graphic, and historical perspec- tives. Recent graduates hold academic appointments in some of the most prestigious universi-ties in North America and makedistinguished contributions to scholarship and musical compo-sition on both the national and international levels. Deliberatelysmall, the graduate program admits six to eight students per year. Through research-oriented seminars, independent study,and close work with faculty advisers, the program preparesstudents for careers in whichtheir scholarly and creative work will stretch and redefine the boundaries of current knowl-edge. Accordingly ,students are strongly encouraged to workwith faculty mentors to develop scholarly papers or compositions for public presentation and publication. Located in the largest private university in the world and inthe world's most exciting city for arts and culture, the NYU Department of Music has access to unmatched facilities and resources. The departmenthouses the American Institute for Verdi Studies, containing perhaps the largest collection ofVerdi source materials in the world, and the Center for Early Music, committed to the per-formance practice of medieval, Renaissance, and early baroque music and to combining aca- demic study with research in a laboratory performance setting.The department also sponsors the W ashington Square Contemporary Music Society,which presents professional con- certs each year devoted to themost recent music of our time. The University is rich in sup- porting resources, including the Elmer Holmes Bobst Library, which houses an important col- lection of music, books, periodi-cals, and microfilms of musical sources.

FACUL TY EMERITUS Brian Fennelly.266 MUSICPrograms and RequirementsAdmission: Applicants to the depart- ment are encouraged to visit the depart-ment in advance. Students are admittedto the department's graduate programon the basis of a superior academicrecord (as evidenced by transcripts andletters of recommendation) and demon- stration of scholarly and/or creative promise (as evidenced by samples of scholarly writing or composition). Applicants must hold (or be in the process of receiving) a B.A., a B.M., oran equivalent degree, and their under- graduate careers should include a strong background in the liberal artsand a special emphasis on music. Applicants intending to specialize in composition should submit three orfour musical works with their applica - tion, with accompanying tapes or CDs if possible. Applicants intending tospecialize in ethnomusicology or his-torical musicology should submit oneor two writing samples that demon - strate their analytical and writing abil- ities. Students applying from NorthAmerica should submit GraduateRecord Examination (GRE) scores. Entering students will ordinarily possess a solid background in harmony,counterpoint, and analysis. They shouldexpect to take a diagnostic examinationin these areas at the beginning of theirfirst semester of study. Students arestrongly encouraged to work with thedirector of graduate studies and rele-vant faculty to ensure they remedy anydeficiencies the diagnostic examinationreveals. Deficiencies should be reme - died before students take the general examination and before completing the second year of course work. Ph.D. students who transfer to the department with a master' sdegree from another university are required to take the general examination. They may, however, transfer some of theirprevious course credits with theapproval of the director of graduatestudies. All students registering for courses must have their choices approved by the director of graduate studies. Students not enrolled in the depart-ment must have written approval ofthe instructor and the director of grad-uate studies to register for a depart-mental course. GRADUATE GUIDELINES The description in this bulletin repre- sents the Department of Music, itspolicies, its faculty, and its programsas of spring 2005. A major curricularoverhaul will be effected after thisbulletin goes to print; for up-to-dateinformation on the requirements for the program and the courses offered,please consult the Web site at www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/music. MASTER OF ARTS AND DOC- TOR OF PHILOSOPHY All graduate students in the Department of Music are enrolled forthe Ph.D. degree and take a total of 72 points of course work. After complet- ing 36 points of credit, passing thegeneral examination and one languageexamination, and remedying any the-ory deficiencies, however, students areeligible for the M.A. as an interimdegree. The M.A. degree is not auto-matically awarded; students must apply for it. However, it is strongly recommended that qualified studentstake the degree and that they apply forit as soon as they are eligible. Theapplication should be made well inadvance of the date of the degree; thedeadlines and procedures are outlinedin this bulletin and on the GraduateSchool of Arts and Science W eb site. Graduate Program Requirements Full-time Status: All graduate students receiving MacCracken Fellowships arerequired to maintain full-time statusover the duration of their fellowship\u2014in most cases for five years. Full-time status means the following: 1. While enrolled in classes, a student must be registered for 24 points ofcredit each year. Ordinarily, these 24points are distributed evenly over thefall and spring semesters. Foreign stu - dents holding student visas must regis-ter for 12 points each semester; if forsome reason they register for fewer points, the department must officially confirm their full-time status to theOffice of International Students andScholars (OISS). Any student who reg - isters for fewer than 8 points in a givensemester ,whatever her or his status, whatever the reason (see the following),must fill out a \"Full-time/Half-timeForm\" in the department. It is the stu- dent's responsibility to do this. 2. Although not encouraged to do so, astudent may carry a reduced course load of 8 points of course work duringthe semester preceding the generalexamination. 3. During the final year of course work, a student may, if she or he nolonger has 24 points of work remain-ing, take a reduced load equal to thenumber of points still to be completedfor the Ph.D.4. A student who has completed all course work for the Ph.D. and who isstill being supported under theMacCracken program must maintainmatriculation for each semester inorder to retain full-time status. Thisrequires formal registration, as though for a course. Maintenance of matricula- tion is free for the remainder of the student's MacCracken fellowship andfor six semesters thereafter. After that,afee will be charged by the University. It is crucial that students maintain their full-time status during their MacCracken period, and that there- after they maintain matriculation untilthey complete their doctorate. Foreign students in residence on student visas risk losing their visa by not doing so.Students with outstanding student loans risk having their loans recalled.Beyond that, back fees will quicklyaccumulate, placing a potentially crip-pling burden on students when theycome to graduate, since they will notbe permitted to receive their degreeuntil all fees have been paid. It is thestudent's responsibility to see that sheor he is properly registered as a full-time student, and later that she or hemaintains matriculation. Academic Standing: Students are expected to be in good academicstanding at all times. In theDepartment of Music, \"good academicstanding\" means the following: (1) agrade point average of 3.5 or better;(2) no more than two grades lowerthan B over the course of the student's career, and no grades of F or N; (3) no more than two grades of Incompleteover the course of the student' scareer; (4) passage of the general examination and satisfaction of other degreerequirements in a timely manner, asdescribed in this bulletin and on thedepartment's Web site. Students whofail to meet the criteria for good aca-demic standing may be placed on aca-demic probation for up to onesemester, during which time they canwork with the director of graduatestudies and other faculty to resolvetheir academic difficulties. Students onprobation who do not return to goodacademic standing by the end of theprobationary semester risk terminationof their fellowship. Arts and science doctoral students in good standing who are beyond theirfirst year of doctoral study are eligibleto take graduate courses at the follow-ing distinguished universitiesthroughout the greater New York area:MUSIC 2671. Columbia University, GSAS (www.columbia.edu/cu/gsas) 2. CUNY Graduate Center (www.gc.cuny.edu) 3. Fordham University, GSAS (www.fordham.edu/gsas) 4. Graduate Faculty, New School University (www.newschool.edu/gf/index.htm) 5.Princeton University (http://gso.princeton.edu) 6. Rutgers University, New Brunswick (http://gsnb.rutgers.edu) 7. Stony Brook University (www.grad.sunysb.edu) 8. Teachers College, Columbia University (www.tc.columbia.edu) Outside W ork: In general, GSAS does not permit graduate students on MacCracken fellowships to engage inoutside work. This is stated in the fel-lowship award letter issued by theGraduate School. Students wishing towork must obtain the permission ofthe director of graduate studies; if thisis obtained, the request must be for-warded to Associate Dean RobertaPopik by the department for herapproval. The department will try toaccommodate student needs in this regard, but it is required to maintain strict oversight of such activity. Language Examinations: Students must demonstrate reading competencyin one modern European language\u2014usually French, German, or Italian\u2014by passing a written examinationadministered by the department beforetaking the general examination. Between the general and special exam- inations, students must demonstratereading knowledge in a second lan - guage (students in composition areexempted from this requirement).Students are expected to select a sec-ond language appropriate to theirresearch topic. Ordinarily, studentswill have passed the second languageexamination by no later than the thirdyear of study .No student in musicol - ogy or ethnomusicology may advance to candidacy without having passed the second language. General Examination: The general examination tests the student's knowl-edge of all major aspects of the field.Students are expected to display sophis-ticated skills in dealing with intellec-tual problems and should be able tocreate and support thoughtful lines ofargument from a wide range of evi-dence. Those specializing in historicalmusicology should demonstrate a thor-ough general knowledge of Western musical history, of Western music'schanging styles, and of current issues in the discipline. Students are expected tocite and discuss recent musicologicalwriting and to advance and supportcoherent arguments about major issuesin response to the questions posed onthe examination. Those specializing inethnomusicology should demonstratean understanding of the history of thediscipline, its theories and principalethnographies, and major musical cul-tures. Students specializing in composi- tion and theory are expected to be familiar with the principal composersand compositional models of the lastcentury and to be able to handle prob- lems of practical analysis. Whatever their field of specialization, students arealso expected to have a basic knowledgeof the other fields of music scholarshipand to incorporate this knowledge intotheir examination responses. Preparationfor the examination should therefore include independent study of both repertoire (with extensive listening andanalysis as appropriate) and scholarlywriting about music. There are three possible outcomes of the examination: 1. A student may pass the examination at a level deemed appropriate for con-tinued studies toward the Ph.D. andin so doing qualify for the M.A. inmusic. 2. A student may pass the examination at the M.A. level (and qualify for theM.A.) but not at a level consideredacceptable for further studies in thedepartment. Students may then retakethe examination only once, one yearafter the original, and may register forfurther study only provisionally until the examination is passed. 3. A student may fail the examination outright. Students who fail the exami-nation may repeat it only once, oneyear after the original, and may regis-ter for further study only provisionallyuntil the examination is passed. Special Examination, Dissertation Proposal, and Advancement toCandidacy: During the third or fourth year of study, students shouldselect a principal adviser for the disser-tation and, in consultation with theiradviser ,should select two other faculty to form a dissertation committee. Onemember of the committee may come from outside the department, or, more rarely, from outside the university.Students should develop a dissertationproject in close consultation with thecommittee they have chosen.Ordinarily, this work should be suffi- ciently developed to allow students totake the special examination by some- time in their fourth year of study. Thespecial examination requirement maybe met in one of two ways, which stu-dents should choose after close consul-tation with their adviser andcommittee, subject to approval by thedirector of graduate studies. Studentsmust satisfy the special examinationrequirement before they will beadvanced to candidacy. 1. Students may elect to ask their committee to prepare an individual-ized special examination that tests the student's competence in the planned field of research, in related fields, and in current methodological and theoret- ical approaches to the dissertation sub- ject. The examination may consist of written and oral components at thediscretion of the committee. Studentswho satisfy the special examinationrequirement in this way will thendevelop a dissertation proposal thatmust be submitted to the departmen - tal faculty for approval. 2. Students may elect, instead, to develop a dissertation proposal in con - sultation with their committee and to present it to that committee as the cen-tral text on which the committee willconduct an oral examination. Lastingfrom one to two hours, this examina-tion will probe the student's compe-tence in the planned field of research, inrelated fields, and in current method - ological and theoretical approaches tothe dissertation topic. Students shouldexpect that the committee may requiresubstantial revisions of their proposal.Students who pass this oral examinationon their dissertation proposal will be approved to begin work immediately on the dissertation. Whether prepared after a special examination or as the central text of aspecial examination, the dissertationproposal should succinctly state (1) theresearch question to be studied; (2) how the question relates to existing scholarship; (3) the methods to beused (e.g., approaches to fieldwork,analytical techniques, theoreticalframework); and (4) how the disserta - tion will contribute to knowledge ofthe field. A proposed chapter outlineand working bibliography should alsobe included. For students specializingin composition, the principal part ofthe dissertation will be a compositionof significant proportions accompaniedby a thesis on a topic in musical analy - sis or theory .In their dissertation pro - posal, composers must include a brief268 MUSICdescription of the intended composi- tion, and they must discuss scoring, any texts to be set, and the plannedstructure and size. Additionally, they should discuss the thesis as describedabove. Students who fulfill all the require- ments for the Ph.D. and who declineto complete a dissertation may requestthat the department award the M.Phil.(Master of Philosophy) degree. Dissertation Defense: The completed dissertation will be defended in a pub- lic oral examination to be adminis- tered by a committee of five faculty.This defense will follow rules estab-lished by the Graduate School of Artsand Science. Ordinarily, the examiningcommittee will consist of the three-member committee that advised the dissertation and two additional faculty who are appointed by the director ofgraduate studies in consultation withthe student and principal adviser. The examining committee must include at least three members of the GSAS fac-ulty. At least three committee mem-bers must approve the dissertationprior to the scheduling of the defense.The dissertation must be distributedto all members of the committee atleast a month before the scheduleddefense. At least four of the five mem-bers of the examining committee mustvote to approve the dissertation' soral defense. Fields of Specialization and Their Course Requirements Historical Musicology: The special - ization in historical musicology isintended to familiarize students withthe modes of thought and researchtechniques in that discipline. Studentsshould expect to develop skills in doc - ument study, archival research, analy- sis, editing, the study of performanceand performance practices, historiogra-phy, and recent critical approachessuch as genre, gender ,and reception studies. The 36 points of course work before the general examination include thefollowing minimum requirements: 1. Introduction to Musicology (G71.2101) 2. Ethnomusicology: Theory and History (G71.2136) 3. a course in musical analysis Students should choose other courses from a range of repertoires and criticalperspectives. Ethnomusicology: The training in ethnomusicology explores the historyof the discipline, its principal theories and methodologies, and a wide diver- sity of musical styles and forms fromaround the world. Students learn how to design and carry out fieldwork-based research projects, performlibrary and archival research, explore arange of multimedia approaches toanalysis and publication, and engagein applied/public ethnomusicology.The EthnoLab incorporates digitalworkstations recording equipmentfor documenting and studying per-formance traditions. World MusicEnsembles are included as a means of deepening an appreciation for the complexities of musical sound, aes-thetics, and performance practice; as training for learning music in field- work; and as preparation for teaching similar ensembles. Minimum course work require - ments in ethnomusicology include the following: 1. Introduction to Musicology (G71.2101) 2. Ethnomusicology: Theory and History (G71.2136) 3. Musical Ethnography (G71.2166) 4. one other graduate course from the department 5. a course in anthropology or per- formance studies 6. four semesters of the ethnomusicol - ogy ensembles Composition and Theory: The spe - cialization in composition and theoryis designed to provide training incomposition through original creativework and through analytical study ofother composers' works. Studentsdevelop skills in analytical methodolo - gies and in music theory, with particu- lar emphasis on music of the 20thcentury. The department's computermusic studio includes multiplatformdigital (including real-time) soundsynthesis capabilities. The departmentmakes arrangements for students toreceive regular performances of theircompositions by professional NewYork City musicians in department-sponsored series such as First Performance and the Washington Square Contemporary Music Societyseries. In addition to its full-time fac-ulty, the department regularly offerssemester -long seminars in composition and theory taught by distinguished visitors. (Recent visitors have includedMilton Babbitt, Charles Wuorinen,Andrew Imbrie, George Perle, MartinBoykan, Joseph SeverineNeff, among others.)Course work requirements comprise the following: 1.

It is intendedfor the gifted performer specializing inthe re-creation of early music, forwhose work a solid musicologicalbackground is essential. Students seeking admission should normally have an undergraduate degreein music, including knowledge of musicfrom before circa 1630, and some expe-rience of performing in an early music ensemble or on early instruments. At the discretion of the director of graduatestudies, students without a first degreebut with exceptional experience in earlymusic performance may be admitted.The certificate may also be taken as partof the program for the Ph.D. The certificate program consists of 24 points of course work, includingthe following: 1. Introduction to Musicology (G71.2101) 2. Notation and Editing of Early Music (G71.2102) 3. one year of Collegium Musicum (G71.1001, 1002) The remaining courses are chosen from those dealing with medieval, Renaissance, and baroque topics.

Students with no languagebackground may satisfy the require-ment by completing four semesters(16 points) of language training atNYU; however, only two of thosesemesters (8 points of undergraduate language credits) may be counted toward the degree. Students who have prior language training or who take an intensive language course in the sum - mer following their first year may sat - isfy the requirement by testing at an upper intermediate level of proficiencyor by enrolling in an advanced class.Native speakers with fluency in read - ing, writing, listening, and speakingmay waive this requirement with thepermission of the director .The pro - gram encourages all students to pursuelanguage training through theadvanced (graduate) level. Master's Thesis or Report: The mas- ter's thesis should generally have theformat, style, and length of a substan-tial scholarly article in a MiddleEastern studies field. Alternatively, itcan have the format and style of a pro-fessional report, with a length andsubstance similar to a scholarly article. In either case, it must present the author's own research and relate this toexisting scholarly understandings of the topic or field. Students should begin discussing possible topics for thethesis or report by the end of theirfirst year and should select a topic andan adviser, in consultation with thedirector of graduate studies, before theend of their third semester. Studentsare encouraged to conduct research ontheir topic during the summer follow-ing their first year . Internships: The internship program draws on the resources of New YorkCity as a center of international poli - tics and culture. Internships provide practical training in the kinds ofresearch and report writing requiredfor careers in public and nongovern-mental service, policy research, cul-tural affairs, and political advocacy.The internship program enables stu-dents to make professional contacts infields they are interested in joiningand to share their skills with organiza- tions as they explore a particular fieldor issue.

Anthony Movshon DIRECTOR OF GRADUATE STUDIES: Professor Kiorpes eural science acollection of disciplines uni- fied by a con- cern for the function of the brain. Experimental approachesin neural science vary from analyses of molecular and cellu-lar mechanisms in nerve cells and groups of nerve cells tobehavioral and psychologicalstudies of whole organisms. Theoretical tools include mathe - matical and computationalmodeling approaches that have proved useful in other areas ofscience. Experimental questionsinclude issues related to bio-physical and neurochemicalmechanisms within single nervecells, functional neural circuitsconsisting of small numbers of neurons, the behavior of lar ge systems of neurons, and the rela - tionship between the activity of elements of the nervous systemand the behavior of organisms. The doctoral program in neu- ral science provides advancedtraining for research careers inneural science. Opportunities exist for study in both experi- mental and theoretical aspects ofthe field. Areas of specialization neurochemistry, neuro-biology, and matical ,computational neuroscience, robotics and artifi- cial intelligence, and cognitivescience. The curriculum of the Ph.D. program is designed toprovide research training of thehighest caliber to a small groupof full-time students with varied backgrounds and interests.

Each student'srecord is examined by the department chair to determine allowable transfer credit. Students who have received anM.A. degree in performance studies atNew York University and who havebeen given permission to proceed to the Ph.D. must complete an additional 36 points for the doctorate. There are three required courses for Ph.D. students: Advanced Readings inPerformance Studies (H42.2201) andResources and Methods inPerformance Studies (H42.2616),taken during the first year of doctoralcourse work, and Dissertation ProposalAdvising (H42.2301), taken uponcompletion of the language require-ment, 72 points of course work, andthe area examination. The department' sPerformance Composition (H42.2730) workshops are the only practical workshops countedtoward the degree. Ph.D. students arepermitted to take two PerformanceComposition courses as part of theircourse work. Up to 12 points of aca-demic course work may be taken out - side the department or through theInter-University Doctoral Corsortium with permission of the chair . Adoctoral candidate must complete all degree requirements no later thanten years after entering the M.A. pro - gram or seven years after entering the Ph.D. program. For details regarding degree conferral, see the Degree Requirements section of this bulletin. Foreign Language Proficiency: A candidate for the doctorate must demonstrate proficiency in at least one foreign language. Students are urgedto fulfill the language requirementbefore they have completed 24 pointsof course work. For further informa-tion, see the Degree Requirements section of this bulletin. Area Examination: The area exami- nation is offered every spring semester.At a meeting during the registrationperiod each semester ,the policies and procedures of the area examination areoutlined in detail. Students must takethe area examination the first time itis offered after they have fulfilled theforeign language requirement and completed 72 points of course work. The area examination consists of three sets of take-home questions to be answered within a period of 12 days. Students are examined in one generalarea and two areas of their design. The areas are developed in consultationwith the students' adviser and must be approved by a faculty committee two semesters prior to the examination semester. The two topic areas may be(1) a theory area, (2) a history area, (3) agenre of performance, or (4) a geo- graphical or cultural area's perform- ance. Students prepare preliminary and final reading lists for their advisingcommittee's review. The advising com- mittees draft each student's examina- tion questions according to the approved reading lists and topic area statements. Students must answer one question in each area. If a student fails aquestion, the student must take the question again the following year. Thestudent may be required to completeadditional course work before takingthe examination again. A student whofails one or more questions twice can-not continue in the Ph.D. program.Students should consult the depart-ment office regarding deadlines andprocedures. Admission to Candidacy: Formal candidacy is granted only after a stu - dent has been in residence for a year , demonstrated foreign language profi- ciency, passed the area examination, and received approval of the disserta - tion proposal. Doctoral Dissertation: Dissertation Proposal Advising (H42.2301) isrequired the semester after the studenthas passed the area examination.When the dissertation proposal is completed, it must be reviewed and approved by a three-member facultycommittee. Consult the department for the pro- cedures for defending the dissertation.Any reader who is not a member ofthe New York University GSAS fac-ulty must be approved in advance byGSAS. All five members of the disser-tation committee must be presentwhen the student publicly defends thedissertation. Three of the five readersmust be faculty of the Department ofPerformance Studies or approved fac-ulty from another NYU department. DEPARTMENTAL FINANCIAL AID The Department of Performance Studies makes every effort to help stu-dents finance their graduate educa-tion. Students are eligible for thefollowing forms of financial aid fromthe department: graduate assistant-ships, which carry full tuition remis-sion plus a stipend, in exchange for awork commitment of 20 hours perweek; University scholarships, which are awarded as partial tuition remis- sion; and a limited number of namedscholarships.

Healing and Performance H42.1026 Barbara Browning. 4 points. An exploration of the ways in which performance theory and practice haveinformed the field of medical anthro - pology and the ways in which medicalanthropology can in turn amplify andinform the creation and analysis ofperformance. Examines seminal textsin both fields (including Artaud, L\u00e9vi-Strauss, Turner, Kleinman, Taussig,Scheper-Hughes and Lock, andCsordas) to find points of contact andconfluence. Also explores a variety ofperformances (in diverse cultural con - texts) that take on the issue of healing. Topics in Queer Theory: Punks and Divas H42.1035 Tavia Nyong'o. 4points. a performance queer? Rather than offering a comprehensiveanswer to this question, this seminardevotes itself to an intensive examina-tion of two queer performance per-sonae: the punk and the diva. Whatare the genealogies of the punk andthe diva? How do punk and diva per - formances intersect with, diver ge from, and intensify each other? Why and how do the punk and the divaseem to elicit queer spectatorship?undergraduate and graduate resident hall facilities and develop programs,provide counseling and referral serv-ices, and perform administrative tasks.The remuneration for a resident assis-tant is room and board.

DEPARTMENTAL PUBLICATIONS TDR: The Journal of Performance Studies is edited by Richard Schechner; associ- ate editor is Mariellen R. Sandford.Most issues are eclectic, dealing withlive performance, media, and perform - ance theory .Topics range from experi - mental performance to ethnographic studies. Articles are published detail-ing performances in a variety of cul - tures from all over the world. TDR invites opinions, debates, letters from readers and contributors, and reportson performances, books, conferences,and festivals. About one issue in six isa\"theme issue,\" devoted to a single topic. In addition to the editor andassociate editor, two graduate studentswork on TDR, one as managing editor. Women & Performance: A Journal of Feminist Theory is a semiannual publi- cation produced independently by stu- dents, faculty ,alumnae, and alumni of the Department of PerformanceStudies. It is the first ongoing publica - tion of its kind devoted to a feministinvestigation of performance. Thejournal encourages dialogue among performers, theorists, and spectators by providing a forum for feminist crit-ical theory in theatre, dance, film,video, music, and ritual. It discusses feminist aesthetics and includes per-formance documentation, articles onwomen in historical performance,reviews, scripts, and resource listings.Students on staff work in variousphases of production, including writ-ing, copyediting, proofreading, layout,paste-up, advertising, circulation, anddistribution. CURRICULUM To make performance a primary con- cern is to blur radically the boundariesof disciplines, to subvert the hierar-chies and exclusions of the canon, andto examine cultures for the diversity ofperformance modes and concepts. As adiscipline of \"inclusions,\" performancestudies provides an integrating, com- parative perspective on the entire con- tinuum of human action from \"life events,\" sports, public ceremonies, and ritual to aesthetic theatre and dance. Courses in theory and methodology, while developing a distinctive body ofconcepts and approaches, explore theo - ries of performance indigenous to Asia,Africa, Europe, Latin America, andother parts of the world and drawfrom various disciplines\u2014anthropol - ogy, sociology, history, literary theory,semiotics, feminist and queer theory,Marxism, psychoanalysis, the study ofcolonial discourse, movement analysis,aesthetics, and theatrical theory. Although well established as a disci- pline, the study of Western theatre hastended to emphasize a historicalapproach to a canon of dramatic litera - ture. In contrast, the performance stud-ies curriculum focuses on extraliteraryor nonliterary aspects of performance. In keeping with the integrated per- spective on performance, courses dealwith dance not only as a performingart in its own right but also as a vitalconstituent of theatre, ritual, andsocial life. Courses train students to identify the basic components ofmovement; to see, discriminate, anddescribe movement behavior in all itsforms and contexts; and to applyknowledge of movement style to stud-ies of dance and culture. Dance historyis studied as an aspect of cultural his-tory and in relation to the other arts. Folk performance and popular entertainment (including the modern media) have constituted a culturallyand artistically vital alternative theatreand important influence on contempo-rary performance. The forms of popu-lar entertainment, their internal logic and aesthetics, are studied in relation to their historical formation and cul- tural setting. The study of folk per-formance focuses on how people in their everyday lives shape deeply felt values into meaningful form\u2014for example, conversational humor and storytelling, improvised play and tra-ditional games, competitive streetdance, domestic rituals, and neighbor-hood and community celebrations. Amajor concern is the nature of tradi-tion, which is seen as a process rootedin social life as well as in time andspace. Courses in performance studies are also developed in order to explore thepolitical and ideological implicationsof performance. Postcolonial, feminist,and queer theory are employed asframes to investigate how artisticforms subvert and uphold particularideological forms. While performance studies is not a studio-based program, students areencouraged to take at least one course(but not more than three) in perform - ance practice. Each semester, coursesin performance composition and movement are offered.286 PERFORMANCE STUDIESHow do such performances enact queer identifications, particularlythose identifications that occur at thelimit of gender? How might an atten-tion to performance, and in particular,to punk and diva performances, helprevise existing accounts of queer the-ory and queer Mercer, Jos\u00e9 to such Caballe, the Ramones,Pansy Division, Le Tigre, SkunkAnansie, Diamanda Galas, NinaSimone; and view films by such direc - tors as Julie Brown, John Waters,Greg Araki, Sadie Bening, ToddHaynes, and John Cameron Mitchell. Aesthetics of Everyday Life H42.1040* Barbara Kirshenblatt- Gimblett. 4 points. The formation of vernacular culture in New Y ork City\u2014how people shape their expressive behavior in relation to the conditions of their lives. Debateson the nature of vernacular culture andits creative and emancipatory potential in relation to mass media and the cen- tralization of power in modern society. Tourist Productions H42.1041* Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett. 4 points. How tourist settings, events, and arti- facts are produced, interpreted, andconsumed; the \"production of culture\"for the consumption of the \"other\"(guest, stranger, tourist, expatriate,pilgrim); tradition and authenticityand the synthetic nature of culture;the process of aestheticizing and com-moditizing history, politics, and aes-thetics of tourist cultural production. Theories of Directing H42.1060 Richar dSchechner .4points. Starts with a brief theoretical-histori- cal overview of directing. Then exam-ines four directorial approaches totexts\u2014realization, interpretation,adaptation, and deconstruction. Nextlooks at the director-actor relationshipin terms of actor training. Finally, con-siders how directors deal with inter - culturalism. Uses as examples the works of Stanislavsky, Meyerhold,Brecht, Grotowski, Brook, Schechner,Le Compte, Mnouchkine, Suzuki, andOng. Students give classroom reportsand stage short scenes. Performing Cultures in the Middle East and North Africa H42.1065 Deborah Anne Kapchan. 4 points. Focuses on the expressive culture of the Middle East and North Africa, lookingat both sacred (religious) practices andmore popular forms of cultural per-formance, such as music, poetry, film,festivals, novels, and dance. Analyzes allthese practices in their historical con-text as well as their place in the historyof scholarship in and about the Middle East and North Africa. Explores the many and various forms of being andknowing extant in contemporary cul-tures of the Arab-Islamic world. Drawsheavily on ethnographic texts but alsodraws inspiration from readings in phi-losophy, literature, and history. History of the Body H42.1095 Tavia Nyong'o. 4 points. Arhetoric of embodiment has arisen in many contemporary discourses that seek leverage against the abstracting,totalizing, and idealizing tendencies oftheory. Such investments in \"thebody,\" however, risk repeating the veryprocess of abstraction, totalization, andidealization that they seek to counter , particularly when a unitary \"body\" with no further specification is calledon to do all the heavy lifting. Can weproduce a rhetoric of embodiment thatdoes not immediately reinvest itself,through such lack of specification, inthe body/mind dualism? This coursetakes a historical route to answeringthat question, examining the emer-gence of the body as a site of knowl-edge for humanism, while at the sametime attending carefully to human-ism's gendered and how constructionsof \"the body\" produce hierarchizing and marginalizing effects, in terms of which flesh can and cannot access itspains and privileges. W eexplore how sentience and affect are figured through shifting layers of historicalknowledge that unsettle any unitary orstable concept of \"the human.\" conclude range of claims\u2014technical, philo-sophical, and political\u2014that havebeen made recently Foucault, Haraway, Hayles,Kuriyama, Laqueuer, Otis, Reid-Pharr,Schiebinger, and Sedgwick. Projects in Performance Studies H42.2000* Required course for all M.A. students. Resident faculty. 4 points. The final course in master's programs in performance studies. The coursehelps students develop and present a final culminating project. Experimental Performance: History of Performance Art H42.2060 Jos\u00e9 Esteban Mu\u00f1oz. 4 points. This course follows two conceptual tracks: one historical, one philosophi-cal. The history of performance is readaround phenomenology's practice oftheorizing and framing thingness andobjecthood. To this end, selections from the work of Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, and MauriceMerleau-Ponty are included in thecourse readings. One of the chieforganizing concerns here is the moment(s) when human subjects become the object of art. Performanceart is considered in relation to otheraesthetic projects like abstract paint- ing, pop art, postmodern dance, mini- malism, environmental theatre, tropicalismo, and popular entertain- ment. Students look at the works ofvarious artists, among them ChrisBurden, Ana Mendieta, LindaMontano, Adrian Piper, Ron Athey,Franko B., V aginal Davis, Nao Bustamante,Y oko Ono, L ygia Clark, Vito Acconci, and William Pope L. Topics in Critical Theory: Critical Race Theory H42.2100* Jos\u00e9 Esteban Mu\u00f1oz. 4 points. This course offers students methodolo- gies to think critically about race andethnicity .Fundamental phenomeno - logical questions about the relation- ship between \"self\" and \"other\" launchthe inquiry .Early materialist and psy- chological investigations into thenature of racialization are also pursued.Readings and lectures challenge onto-logical claims about the nature of race and ethnicity by proposing theories of racial and ethnic performativity.Critical legal theories are also consid - ered. Intersectional methodologies that consider the relationship betweenracialization and other major rubrics ofdifference like class, gender, and sexu-ality are emphasized as students surveyrecent works in the field of criticalrace theory. This section of the coursebibliography read in conjunctionwith performances as well as literaryand cinematic texts. PERFORMANCE STUDIES 287Bibliography and Research: Advanced Readings inPerformance Studies H42.2201* first-year Ph.D. stu- dents. Jos\u00e9 Esteban Mu\u00f1oz. 4 points. Readings are balanced between founda- tional texts in the field of performance studies as well as new interventionsthat propel the discourse forward. Readings examine the performancestudies project's intersections with dif- ferent lines of thought that includeanthropology, philosophy, feminism,critical race theory, legal theory, Marxism, and queer critique. Students are expected to assemble an annotatedbibilography on some aspect of the fieldas well as writing a final research paper. Seminar on Antonin Artaud H42.2202* Allen Weiss. 4 points. Dissertation Proposal Advising H42.2301* Required for doctoral stu- dents. Prerequisite: 76 points of completedcourse work. Staff. 0 points. Emphasis is on problems and opportu - nities of research, writing, and editingas they apply to the doctoral disserta-tion. Each student prepares a disserta - tion proposal as a class project. Political Performance H42.2406 Diana T aylor.4points. This course examines the use of per - formance\u2014by the State, by opposi - tional groups, and by theatre andperformance practitioners\u2014to solidifyor challenge structures of power .The course looks at specific examples of how public spectacles have been used in the 20th and 21st centuries\u2014fromNazi rallies to antiwar demonstrations,AIDS activism, and \"escraches\" (acts ofpublic shaming by the children of the\"disappeared\" in Argentina), to thecurrent use of stagecraft by the Bush administration. Following the lead of Guy Debord, students examine howthe \"concentrated spectacle\" of fascismand military in the \"integrated spectacle\"of the current U.S. administration.Students are asked to develop theirown sites of analysis. Readings includeGuy Debord, Walter Banjamin,Bertold Brecht, Adorno, AugustoBoal, and others. The course includes aWeb component. Studies in Dance: Still Acts H42.2504* Andr\u00e9 Lepecki. 4 points. Perception has a social structure\u2014it operates by erasing certain acts fromits cognitive field and dismissing those acts as being either in/significant orim/perceptible. In those leftover zones filled with canceled meanings and microscopic perceptions, we find traces ofthe deep ideological imbrications between sensory and signification. However, the \"insignificant\" and the\"imperceptible\" also constitute many shady areas for unruly creativity, sub-version, and resistance. In the develop- ment of Western choreographicimagination and ideologies, one acthas been particularly accused of lack- ing in signification, purpose, and value: the still act. However, one cantrace in dance's uses of stillness notonly extraordinary challenges to hege-monic structures of perception but tothe very definition of dance. This sem-inar examines the epistemological,political, and performative challengesbrought by uses withinWestern seminarcontextualizes stillness in dance histor-ically ,theoretically, and aesthetically by tracing its uses in the visual arts,performance art, and film. Studentsread closely seminal texts in the his-tory of perception (Benjamin, challengesnot only dance's ontology but, moreambitiously, undermines the verynotion of Being. Performance Theory: Performance, Identity ,and the Law H42.2602 Ann Pellegrini. 4 points. An examination of the interplay between \"identity\" and \"the law\" (inboth its regulatory and generativemodes) with a focus on the U.S. con- text.

St. Paul [1991]) through the critical resources of performance studies, criti-cal race theory, and feminist and queertheories. Special attention is given tolaw's reliance on \"the precedent\" andanalogy (the precedent as analogy?) toconstruct identity and difference. Asian American Performance H42.2608 Karen Shimakawa. 4 points. Considers a range of Asian Pacific American performances\u2014theatre,dance, quotidian, as well as visual andaural/musical\u2014in light of recentdevelopments in the theorization of Asian American culture/history/iden-tity. How do the shifts in ways we sit- uate Asian Pacific Americanness (within American history/culture? within global and/or transnational his-tories/flows?) shift our ways of seeing APA performance, and vice versa?Requirements: one to two class presen- tations/discussion facilitations;biweekly stu-dents: article-length essay). Methods Required course for first- year Ph.D. students. BarbaraKirshenblatt-Gimblett. 4 points. The development of performance stud- ies methodologies based on interdisci-plinary research paradigms (movementanalysis, ethnomusicology, ethnogra-phy, history, oral history, orature,visual studies, ethnomethodology,among others) and the close readingand analysis of exemplary studies.Considers the conceptualization anddesign of research projects in the con-text of theoretical and ethical issuesand in relation to particular researchmethods and writing strategies.Develops practical skills related toarchival and library research; ethno - graphic approaches, including partici - pant observation and interviewing;documentation and analysis of liveperformance; and analysis of docu-ments of various kinds, includingvisual material. Readings address the history of ideas, practices, and images of objectivity ,as well as of reflexive and interpretive approaches, relation- ships between science and art, andresearch perspectives arising fromminoritarian and postcolonial experi-ences. Assignments include weekly readings, written responses to the readings, and exercises. Students areencouraged to bring projects to thecourse, especially ones that mightdevelop into dissertations. Drama, Theatre, and Performance: Theories of Spectatorship H42.2746 Diana Taylor. 4 points. An exploration of the many ways in which theorists and theatre practition-ers have thought about the ways inwhich staged action (whether in film,theatre, or politics) pacifies, activates,interpolates, and manipulates percepticide, spect-actor, PERFORMANCE as Aristotle's The Poetics and Popul Vuhbut others. Performance H42.2860 Karen Shimakawa. 4 points. This course locates the genre of (con- temporary) \"intercultural performance\"within the context of the rise oftransnational and/or \"global\" capital-ism. How might the former term beseen as a materialization of, catalystfor, or commentary on, the latter\u2014orvice versa? The course considers cur - rent theories of the bases of transna-tionalism, its current formations (itslegal, corporate, labor, and representa-tional manifestations), as well as con - current developments in intercultural performance. Requirements: one totwo Anexamination of the challenges and possibilities of cross-cultural danceanalysis. Begins with a brief overview of the history of the field and a consid-eration of the advantages and disad- vantages of a variety of methods and approaches. Then alternates close read-ings of recent dance ethnographieswith the workshopping of students'own writing. Student projects may bebased on previously performed field-work or on research conducted specifi-cally for the class. The course includesweekly readings, written responses tothe readings, and exercises. Studentsare encouraged to bring projects to thecourse, especially ones that might develop into dissertations. Topics in Music and Performance: Music and the Sacred H42.2960 Deborah Anne Kapchan. 4 points. What does Sufi qawwali music have in common with African American gospel? What does the spate of inter- national \"sacred music festivals\" and the popularity of \"trance\" music tell usabout contemporary culture and its ideologies? Analyzing cultures of theworld, French sociologist Emile Durkheim noted that all cultures have categories for the sacred and the pro-fane. Music is a primary modality forthe expression of both. This coursefocuses on how sacred emotions,including (but not limited to) thoseembedded in religion, are transmittedin musical traditions\u2014both historicaland understandings of religionand ritual (Durkheim, Mauss, Bell,and others), the course moves on to examine the agency of music as an expressive form and how forms ofhearing/listening and making soundhave defined (and continue to define)ways of sacred being.

Areas of specializa-tion include astrophysics andcosmology, atomic optical and molecular physics, condensedmatter physics, elementary par-ticle physics, quantum field theory and string theory ,many- body and statistical physics, andnonlinear dynamics. Although the curriculum is designed pri-marily to meet the needs of full-time students, opportunitiesalso exist for part-time students. ANDRE AND BELLA MEYER HALL 4 WASHINGTON PLACE, ROOM 424 NEW YORK, NY 10003-6621 212-998-7700 TPrograms and RequirementsAdmission: Applicants considered for admission have usually completed theequivalent of an under graduate major in physics and maintained an averageof at least B or better in physics and inmathematics. Calculus and ordinarydifferential equations are prerequisiteto all courses. Special consideration isgiven to applicants with an under grad- uate major in mathematics, engineer - ing, or another science. Such studentsordinarily take remedial work to makeup under graduate deficiencies in physics before they proceed in the reg- ular degree program. Applicants are required to submit scores from the general and subject testsof the Graduate Record Examination(GRE). Applicants whose native lan-guage is not English must also submitscores from the Test of English as aForeign Language (TOEFL). Colloquia and Seminars: Faculty and students attend the weekly departmen-tal colloquia, which highlight progressin cutting-edge research areas of broadand general interest. The departmentholds weekly seminars in astrophysics,particle physics, atomic optical and molecular physics, nonlinear dynamics, condensed matter physics, theoreticalphysics, relativity, and cosmology.Distinguished lectures endowed by theJames Arthur and Stanley H. Klosk Funds are held periodically. Informalinteractions and \"journal clubs\"\u2014where students, postdoctoralresearchers, and faculty discussresearch in progress\u2014promote collabo-ration within and across subfields.Interaction is also fostered with pro - grams at the Courant Institute ofMathematical Science, the Center forNeuroscience (program for theoreticalneuroscience), the School of Medicine,and the Departments of Chemistry andBiology. Special Notes: Although students may be admitted at midyear, manycourses are full-year courses, so it maynot be possible for those students toenroll for a full-time program. Full-time students are expected to carryeither three courses per semester or theequivalent in approved research. MASTER OF SCIENCE All candidates for the M.S. degree must complete 32 points of credit (atleast 24 in residence at the GraduateSchool and at least 16 in theDepartment of Physics) and achieve agrade point average (GP A) of B (3.0) or better.

In addi- tion to the standard course require-ments, the student is expected toenroll in one semester (4 points) of aresearch course (G85.2091 orG85.3301). Option C: Examination In addition to receiving credit for eight regular courses (one-semester, 4-point courses, not including reading and research), a student choosing this optionmust pass the core courses with an aver-age grade of B or better. For each course, the student has the option of 1. enrolling in the course;2. taking the midterm and final exam- ination of the course if the student is not enrolled; or 3. taking the relevant preliminary examination given just before the startof the fall term. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The Ph.D. program is aimed at enabling a student to prepare for andcarry out research in physics at thefrontier of knowledge. The department encourages entry into dissertation research under the supervision of a fac-ulty member as soon as one hasattained sufficient mastery of the fun-damental principles and techniques of physics. Depth and breadth within the larger context of contemporary physicsare promoted by a flexible set of courserequirements. Numerous seminars andthe weekly Physics Colloquium pro-vide an excellent opportunity for stu-dents to keep abreast of recentdevelopments across the full spectrumof physics research. Special talks by fac- ulty members describing their research programs help students learn aboutresearch activities in the department. Entering students who qualify for admission to the Ph.D. program areoffered a five-year departmental finan-cial aid package with a commitment ofat least two semesters of part-timeteaching duties. Departmental supportmay be withdrawn if a student isdeemed to be not making adequateprogress toward fulfilling the degree requirements. Students who need more than five years to complete theirdegree requirements may apply forresearch assistantships and a limitednumber of fellowships without teach-ing duties. Core Course Requirements The aim of the Ph.D. program is to certify the student' smastery of a tradi- tional body of basic principles andproblem-solving techniques generally considered to be an essential part of aresearch physicist's training. To thisend, a student in the program isrequired to get a B or better in eachpart of four core subjects: 1. Dynamics 2. Statistical Mechanics 3. Electromagnetism (Parts I and II)4. Quantum Mechanics (Parts I and II) Other Options for Satisfying Core Course Requirements Astudent who has taken a course else- where that is equivalent to one of the core courses need not enroll in that course; instead, he or she may satisfythe relevant requirement by achieving either 1. an average grade of B or better based on the midterm and final exami-nation of the course or 2. a grade of B or better on the rele- vant preliminary examination givenjust before the start of the fall term.Each examination is designed to becompleted in two hours (three hoursare allowed to avoid time pressure) andcovers the material of the correspon-ding course at the level of midtermand final examinations. Deadline for Core Course Requirements In order to make satisfactory progress toward the Ph.D., a student must complete all core course requirements by the beginning of his or her secondyear.If a student fails to get a B or better in a core course (or in one of thealternative options) during his or herfirst academic year, the student isobliged to take the relevant prelimi-nary examination just prior to his orher second year. If one or more of the core course requirements are not satis- fied at the start of the student' ssecond year,the Ph.D. qualification commit - tee will review the student' sentire record and decide what action to take. Such action might include a recom- mendation to the faculty that the stu-dent be discontinued from the Ph.D.program. Termination of a studentfrom the program requires a vote ofthe faculty . Experimental Physics Requirement The course Experimental Physics (G85.2075) is required of all students, except for those who have had equiva-lent laboratory experience. Course Requirements Beyond the Core Astudent is required to take at least six courses beyond the core level (notincluding reading and research coursesor Practicum in the Teaching ofPhysics [G85.2090]) in theDepartment of Physics. At least two ofthese courses must be outside the stu-dent's research area. For the purpose ofsatisfying this requirement,Experimental Physics (G85.2075)counts as one of the outside-the-area courses, but Computational Physics (G85.2000) does not. Requirements of the Graduate School Astudent must also satisfy the follow- ing requirements of the Graduate School of Arts and Science: completionof72 points of graduate credit (at least 32 in residence at the GraduateSchool) and a cumulative GP Aof B (3.0) or better. Formation of a Thesis Committee By the beginning of May of the stu- dent' ssecond year ,the student is expected to have arranged for thesis supervision with a member of thephysics faculty. Afour-person thesis committee, chaired by the thesis adviser ,is set up at this time. The membership of the thesis committee is proposed by theadviser in consultation with the stu - dent and must be approved in writingby the director of graduate studies toensure breadth and level of expertise. At the time of its formation, the thesis committee meets with the stu - dent and discusses the student's courseof study, preliminary research plans, and the timing and scope of the oral qualifying examination (see below).The committee conducts an annualreview of the student' sprogress, nor - mally in January . Oral Qualifying Examination The qualifying examination marks the student' sformal entry into dissertation research under the supervision of aparticular faculty member. It takes place after the student has alreadyembarked on some sort of preliminaryresearch with his or her adviser and isadministered by the student's thesiscommittee. The deadline for takingthe oral qualifying examination isJanuary of a student's third year, priorto the annual review. The examination itself consists of a prepared talk by the candidate fol-lowed by a question period. The aim isto examine the student's mastery notonly of the specific area of the stu- dent's intended research, but also of related areas of physics and of (rele- vant) general principles of physics. The committee decides whether the evidence, taken all together, presents a convincing picture of a person with the preparation and skills needed to dooriginal scientific research in the pro-posed area. Annual Review, Progress Report, Thesis Proposal There is an annual review of each stu- dent's progress toward the Ph.D. This includes a progress report submittedby the student. Prior to the formation of a thesis committee, the review is conducted by the Ph.D. qualificationcommittee. Afterward, the student'sthesis committee conducts the review. The first annual progress report fol- lowing the qualifying examination includes a formal proposal for the stu- dent's thesis research. Subsequent progress reports inform the committee onprogress toward completion of the thesis, as well as on any significantmodifications of the original proposal. Oral Thesis Defense The final approval of the student's the- sis and the oral thesis defense is con- ducted by the student's thesis committee, augmented by one addi-tional faculty member. Three members of the examining committee, includ- ing the student's adviser, serve as read-ers of the dissertation.DEPARTMENTAL FINANCIAL AID Anumber of financial aid programs are available for qualified graduatestudents in physics. Further informa-tion can be obtained by writing to thedepartment in care of the graduatesecretary. Note: Financial aid is generally awarded only to students in the doc-toral program.

POETICS AND THEORY 299DIRECTOR OF THE PROGRAM: Professor Anselm Haverkamp Department of English CODIRECTOR OF THE PROGRAM: Associate Professor Mich\u00e8le Lowrie Department of Classics he Program in Poetics andTheory is a trans- disciplinary advanced certificate program that provides an institutionalframework for diverse theoreti-cal initiatives and practices atNew York University. By offer- ing an integrated approach totheoretical concerns in thehumanities, it responds to fre-quently voiced desires for a the-ory initiative across thedisciplines. Rather than puretheorizing, the program focuses on sharing theoreticalapproaches and fosters interdis - ciplinary and international collaboration. The program traces a histori- cal progression from the ancientpractices of poetics and rhetoric to their modern theoreticalheirs. The intimate but vexedrelations between aesthetics andhermeneutics, philosophy andliterature, social institutions andthe work of art, form the core ofstudy. The transdisciplinary orienta - tion of the certificate programcomplements disciplinary study and sharpens students' careerprofiles. 25 WAVERLY PLACE, ROOM 702 NEW YORK, NY 10003-6790 212-998-8597 T Eligibility: All students enrolled in Ph.D. and M.A. programs in theGraduate School of Arts and Science are eligible. Students holding theMacCracken Fellowship pay no addi-tional tuition or fees. Admission: Students already enrolled in a Ph.D. or an M.A. program atNew York University should submit astatement of purpose, a letter of rec-ommendation, clearance from the departmental director of graduate studies, and the first two pages of theregular GSAS application form to thecodirector. For those not already enrolled at NYU, admission to the advanced cer-tificate program is by application tothe Graduate School of Arts andScience, New Y ork University ,P.O. Box 907, New York, NY 10276-0907. ADVANCED CERTIFICATE Atotal of 20 points of course work is required (a maximum of 8 points mayoverlap with the credits required forthe M.A. or Ph.D.): Proseminar in Poetics and the Origins Literary Theory (G40.2001); Poetics andTheory Seminar (G40.2002); and threeadditional courses, of which one mustcover either philosophy or rhetoric orbe a theory survey ,and two must be listed outside the student' shome department (cross-listing in the homedepartment is allowed). In addition to the five courses, stu- dents seeking the advanced certificatemust present a paper at least once at one of the yearly workshops or confer-ences offered by the Program in Poetics and Theory. Students planningon participating in a conference orworkshop develop a paper in the con-text of the Poetics and TheorySeminar ,which focuses on a topic leading to the conference. This paper may be a chapter of the dissertation. CONFERENCES The Program in Poetics and Theory runs annual workshops with a lar ge conference every three years, or ganized in cooperation with the KleistInstitute at the European University Viadrina in Frankfurt an der Oder (Berlin), Germany.Program and RequirementsEXCHANGE PROGRAM AND TRAVEL Ph.D. students may take advantage of anexchange between New York University and the Kleist Institute at the European University Viadrina inFrankfurt an der Oder (Berlin). The timing of the exchange is subject toapproval by the student's department and by the directors of the advancedcertificate program. Students may taketheir MacCracken Fellowships abroadduring a year in which they have no teaching responsibilities. Qualified stu-dents may also apply for stipends from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaftfor a sixth year of funding. 300 POETICS AND THEORYProseminar in Poetics and the Origins of Literary Theory G40.2001 Introduces students to the mostimportant developments in theWestern history of theorizing litera-ture, its production, and its interpreta-tion. Since many courses at NYUsurvey 20th-century literary theory,this course offers some historical back-ground: it brings into conjunctionpre- and post-18th-century traditionsthat rarely come into contact in thecurriculum and are unlikely to be taught in one course. Issues includethe definition of literary genres, differ-ences in registers of style, the relationof pleasure to morality, of the practicalto the aesthetic, and the transforma-tion of these issues in post-Kantiantheories of interpretation. Poetics and Theory Seminar G40.2002 One course every year is identified asthe Poetics and Theory Seminar, whichfocuses on the subject matter of the conference so that students have a cur-ricular framework for preparing apaper for the conference. This course ismeant for students who are already atan advanced stage in their research. CoursesPoliticsDEPARTMENT OF FacultyNathaniel Beck, Professor.

It isan intensive and comprehensive one- year study of the tools required to excelat managing a political campaign orrunning for office. Students in the pro-gram are exposed to all the aspects ofpolitical campaigning, from leadingacademics in the Department ofPolitics to top industry professionals atthe forefront of the political consultingcommunity. The program offers stu-dents a unique setting with access tothe political marketing, advertising,media, and communications expertswho practice at the world' smedia and communications epicenter and who areredefining politics. In addition tostrong offerings in the field ofAmerican political campaign manage - ment, New Y ork University is singular in its attention to political campaignsbeyond the American context. W eoffer courses by experts and practitioners in political campaigns in Latin America and Western and Eastern Europe. Weprovide expertise in the electoral poli - tics of proportional-representation sys- tems and emerging democracies. Admission: Admission to the political campaign management program is gen-erally granted for the fall semester only.Admission is limited to students withstrong academic and professional records.The general test of the Graduate RecordExamination (GRE) is required of allstudents, including all international stu - dents applying from countries in which the GRE is offered. All internationalstudents are also required to submitscores from the Test of English as aForeign Language (TOEFL). Course of Study: Students must com- plete 32 points of course work in thedepartment, which must include therequired courses listed under M.A. Program in Political Management in the Courses section. Before graduation, stu -dents must complete a major project applying their newly mastered skills to a practical problem in political campaign- ing under the guidance of a facultymember. Typically, this project requires students to apply the skills they have learned to an actual political campaign. Students are expected to maintain an average of 3.0 (on a 4.0 scale) in work for the master' sdegree. Each stu - dent should meet each semester with an adviser of his or her choice to dis- cuss and agree on a course of study. MASTER OF AR TS Admission: Admission to the general M.A. program in politics is granted forthe fall semester only .Admission is lim - ited to students whose academic records and letters of recommendation indicateexceptional promise of success in theadvanced study of political science. Thismeans an outstanding undergraduaterecord or other related evidence.Applicants with lower averages may beadmitted where there is indication of aparticular strength in political scienceand clear aptitude for graduate work.The general test of the Graduate RecordExamination (GRE) is required of allstudents, including all international stu-dents applying from countries in whichthe GRE is offered. All internationalstudents are also required to submitscores from the T est of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Course of Study: Six departmental fields of study are offered: politicalphilosophy and theory ,political methodology, American politics, polit- ical economy, comparative politics,and international relations. Studentsare required to complete eight courses(32 points), of which at least six mustbe in the department and four must bein one departmental field. Courses inthe major field must include the fieldcore course. This core course and oneadditional core course are required andare usually the first courses taken in the department. Students must also complete a major project. The M.A. project consists of aseminar paper, which should demon-strate breadth in the conception and mastery of political analysis. Students are required to notify the director of graduate studies at the initiation ofresearch for the master's project. The director of graduate studies must be notified in all cases, whether the paperis to be written in conjunction with, or independent of, a course. The director of graduate studies must approve the proj - ect and designate an adviser to be the first reader, with written notice to both student and adviser. If the paper is writ- ten in conjunction with a course, theadviser would also be the course instruc-tor. The director's approval relates onlyto M.A.-project status and would in noway interfere with assignment or evalu-ation of the essay for course credit. Oncean M.A.-project topic and adviser aredesignated, the director of graduate studies must approve changes to them. Once the adviser has read and approvedadraft, an M.A.-project evaluations committee, appointed annually by thechair to read all M.A. papers, will evalu-ate it. If the evaluations committeeapproves the essay ,it is accepted as the major project. Students are expected to maintain a grade point average of 3.0 (on a 4.0 scale) in work for the master's degree. Each student should meet with his orher adviser every semester to discussand agree on a course of study. The director of graduate studies will assign an adviser prior to the start of the stu-dent' sfirst semester. Foreign Language Requirement: Students must demonstrate proficiency in one language other than English or,with permission of the director ofgraduate studies, in statistics. Studentsdemonstrate proficiency in a foreign language by passing the GSAS foreign language proficiency examination orby completing an intermediate-levelforeign language course with a gradeof B or better. Students demonstrateproficiency in statistics by completingQuantitative Analysis II (G53.2127)with a grade of B or better . POLITICS 303David Stasavage, Associate Professor. Ph.D. 1995, Cornell.

Theother courses are taken from a desig- nated group in other disciplines in theLeonard N. Stern School of Business. Each student is also expected to write anM.A. major project on a topic related to his or her program work. Inaddition, students in this concentra-tion register for a 1-point reading and research course (G53.3991), in which they produce a paper detailing howthey will apply the methods, skills, orknowledge they obtain in their busi-ness courses to political science. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The goal of the Ph.D. program is to prepare students to conduct research,to teach, or to work in applied settingsat the best institutions in the UnitedStates and abroad. To achieve thisgoal, the program specifies the distri-bution of courses, the substance and timing of requirements, the forms of faculty supervision, and the criteria foradvancement within the program. Admission: The general test of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) isrequired of all students, including allinternational students applying fromcountries in which the GRE is offered.All international students are alsorequired to submit the T est of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) scores.Letters of recommendation must clearly indicate that an applicant is capable of successfully pursuing the doctorate. The applicant is also required to submit awriting sample and statement of edu- cational background and objectives. Abachelor's degree is required for admis-sion to the Ph.D. program. A Master ofArts degree is not a requirement foradmission to the Ph.D. program. Course Requirements: Students must complete 72 points (18 courses) beyondthe B.A. degree. There are no depart - ment-wide course requirements. To guard against excessive specialization,students must take at least three courses(12 points) in each of at least two fields.Course credits transferred from anotherinstitution may count toward the fulfill-ment of this requirement. The fields presently recognized by the department include (1) political philosophy and the-ory,(2) political methodology, (3) American politics, (4) political economy , (5) comparative politics, and (6) interna - tional relations. In consultation with their adviser ,students may petition thedirector of graduate studies (DGS) to create a field of their own making. Suchafield may be interdisciplinary. Doctoral students are expected to main-tain a 3.5 grade point average. When entering the program, stu- dents should declare their intended major, which can be changed at anytime in consultation with the student's adviser. A student specializing in anyrecognized field may have to satisfy course requirements established by fac-ulty in this field. Admission to some advanced courses may be conditional on students having taken some othercourses or having an equivalent back-ground. In all cases, students mustconsult their adviser to plan a compre-hensive program of courses and informtheir adviser of any changes. There are no limits on courses taken in other departments or other univer - sity members of the Inter -University Doctoral Consortium (other than thosespecified by the GSAS). Students areencouraged to develop knowledge andacquire methodological skills in sisterdisciplines. To train themselves in academic research and writing, students areencouraged to write research papers, typ - ically by applying or developing thework of a particular course in subsequentreading and research courses. The tworequired papers, the M.A. paper and thePh.D. qualifying paper (see below), arenormally prepared in this way. Students who have satisfied all the requirements of a particular course otherthan the final examination or paper andwho present a written proposal for aresearch paper related to this course mayask the instructor for a research inprogress (RIP) grade. Students whoreceive this grade are expected to take a reading and research course during the subsequent semester(s) to research andwrite the paper .This grade is reported to the registrar as IP (Incomplete Pass) butis distinguished by the department fromIncomplete grades for all other purposes,including financial decisions. On com-pleting the research paper, the studentreceives final grades for the courses. M.A. Paper: Students who enter the program without an M.A. degree mustpresent a written M.A. paper by nolater than the beginning of their secondyear.The specific requirements for the paper depend on the field, but the gen- eral rule is that it should have the for-mat of an article in this field. The topicof the M.A. paper should be chosen inconsultation with faculty members. Oncompletion, the paper is submitted forreading by two faculty members chosenby the director of graduate studies(DGS), no later than within two months after submission. The paper canreceive a high pass, a low pass, or a fail-ing grade. If the paper does not receiveaunanimous high pass, the student may revise and resubmit it by no laterthan the beginning of the fourth semes- ter of residence. Ifthe paper receives a low pass and the student maintains at least a 3.0grade point average, the student is granted the M.A. degree but must leavethe program. If the paper receives a fail- ing grade or if the student's grade point average is below 3.0, no degree isgranted. If the revised paper receivesdifferent grades from the two readers,the DGS appoints a third reader and theexpanded committee will decide thegrade. A student whose M.A. paper andgrade record are satisfactory is consid-ered to have advanced toward the Ph.D. M.A. Waiver: Students entering with an M.A. degree from an equivalentinstitution may petition for a waiver ofup to one year of course requirements(equivalent of 24 points). For this pur-pose, a copy of the M.A. thesis mustbe submitted to the director of gradu-ate studies (DGS) when the studententers the program. The DGS appointstwo faculty members as readers todecide whether the thesis is equivalentin standards and quality to the depart - ment's requirements. If the M.A. the- sis is approved, the student submitsthe waiver petition to the DGS at theend of the first year of residence. Inconsultation with the readers, theDGS decides whether or not to waiveresidence requirements on the basis ofthe M.A. thesis and the grade recordof the student during the first year atNew Y ork University .Please note that if a student is granted a waiver of 24 points, he or she is required to waive one year of academic funding. Communications Requirement: Doctoral students must demonstrate proficiency in a language other thanEnglish. The Graduate School of Artsand Science determines which lan-guages qualify ,but another language can be substituted on recommendationof the student's adviser and the directorof graduate studies and with approvalof the language coordinator. A studentwhose native language is not Englishshould consult the director of graduatestudies regarding fulfillment of thecommunications requirement. Ph.D. Qualifying Examination: No later than the end of the fifth semesterin residence (third semester for stu-dents who receive an M.A. waiver),students must complete the Ph.D.POLITICS 305qualifying examination, which consists of the submission of a qualifying paper(QP) and the oral defense of a syllabus. The QP is a research paper of pub- lishable quality, satisfying all formalrequirements for an article in a given field. Before writing the paper, students should submit a brief proposal to at least two faculty members, who become\"readers\" on approving this proposal. The topic (but not necessarily the field)ofthe QP must differ from that of the M.A. paper, and the two papers must beread by at least four different read- ers. The work on the QP can be andshould be assisted by faculty. Readersevaluate this paper within two monthsof submission. The readers have the option of accepting the paper, suggest- ing revisions, or rejecting the paper .If invited to do so, the student may revisethe paper and resubmit it within six months. If the revision is not acceptedby both readers, the student is consid - ered to have failed this requirement. Students must also submit an origi- nal syllabus for a graduate introductionto a field. This syllabus should attest tothe understanding of the structure ofthe field, as well as to the knowledge ofthe primary and secondary literature.This syllabus is presented at an oralhearing to two faculty members, whothen pass or fail the syllabus and itsdefense. Students who successfully com-plete both of these requirements qualifyas candidates for the Ph.D. degree.Students who do not satisfy bothrequirements by the end of the third year (second year for students who receive an M.A. waiver) are required bythe department to leave the program,save for exceptional circumstances. Dissertation: After completing the qualifying examination, students must present a Ph.D. dissertation proposal. The proposal ordinarily should be pre-sented before the end of the third yearin residence (second year for studentswho receive an M.A. waiver). Studentswho do not present a proposal withinone calendar year of passing their qual- ifying examination must petition the DGS to be allowed to do so. The proposal should specify the prob- lem to be researched, summarize thecurrent state of knowledge, describeresearch procedures, and identify thebodies of relevant information. It shouldbe no more than 15 single-spaced pages,plus a bibliography. A dissertation com-mittee (see below) must approve theproposal. When all members are satis-fied with the proposal, the committeemeets with the student in an advisoryhearing. Acceptance of the proposal sig -nals that the student has satisfied all the requirements for the Ph.D. degree otherthan the dissertation. The dissertation must constitute a substantial body of original research ofpublishable quality. Except by the expressed permission of the chair of the department, the dissertation should not exceed 100,000 words. Once membersofthe committee approve the disserta- tion, an oral defense is scheduled. After the student's thesis director approves the dissertation and the dis- sertation committee agrees that it isready for defense, a final oral defense isscheduled before a panel of five facultymembers appointed by the chair of thedepartment or the director of graduate studies. The GSAS regulates the proce- dures for this defense. The department expects students to complete the dissertation and its defense within four years after finishing courserequirements. GSAS regulations requirestudents to complete them within tenyears from entering the graduate pro-gram (seven years for those enteringwith an M.A. from another university). Advising: On entering the program, each student is assigned a preliminaryadviser after a consultation with theDGS. Students are free to change theiradviser at any time during their resi-dence. They should inform the DGS ofsuch changes. In the month of April of the first year in the program, students meetwith members of their advisory com-mittee (comprising their adviser and one faculty member with whom they have worked) to discuss the substance of their research, progress in the pro- gram, and future plans. Advice for fallregistration may also be given at thismeeting. The DGS notifies all first- year students of the need to schedule this meeting with the adviser andsends a copy of each notice and reportform to the adviser. Following themeeting, the adviser submits a briefreport for the student's file. Before beginning to work on the qualifying paper, students must form a QPcommittee consisting of two read- ers (see above). Students should keepthis committee informed about theprogress of their research. Before beginning to work on the Ph.D. dissertation, students must form athesis committee, comprising at leastthree faculty members (the committeechair and two members), of whom atleast two must be members of thedepartment. Students should consultwith the committee while preparing theproposal and working on the thesis.The Graduate Office maintains a progress checklist for each student,showing the adviser, major and minorfields, M.A. paper topic and readers, QPtopic and committee, and dissertationtopic and committee. The fellowship evaluation and progress (FEP) commit- tee uses this checklist to oversee the progress of all students in the program. Regular Progress: Astudent is con- sidered to be making satisfactory progress as long as she or he does thefollowing: 1. Submits a previously written M.A. thesis on entering the program or con- sults with faculty about writing theM.A. paper during the first semester in the program. 2. Submits the M.A. paper by the beginning of the third semester or, ifinvited to do so, resubmits it by thebeginning of the fourth semester. 3. Submits the QP and the syllabus and defends the syllabus by the end ofthe fifth semester (third for studentsentering with an equivalent M.A.degree) or ,if invited to do so, resub- mits the QP and defends the syllabus by the end of the sixth semester. 4. Defends the Ph.D. proposal within six months of passing the Ph.D. quali-fying examination. Students who are not making satisfac - tory progress are notified by the DGSand must petition the fellowship evalu-ation and progress (FEP) committee tobe allowed to continue in the program. With regard to points 1 through 3 above, this request is granted only if the delay is caused by exceptional cir - cumstances. W ith regard to point 4, it is sufficient that the student demon - strates reasonable progress. All references to time are based on a calendar of effective semesters (nor-mally 12 points). Hence, part-timestudents may take a longer period tosatisfy the requirements. Nonmatriculated Students: Under special circumstances, nonmatriculants(students who are not working towardadegree) may enroll for one course per semester with permission of the direc- tor of graduate studies. Nonmatric-ulants can earn cumulatively no morethan 12 points in the Graduate Schoolof Arts and Science.

Maloney 212-998-7820 DIRECTOR OF MASTER'S PROGRAM: Dr. Barry TORS OF ORAL PROGRAMS: Cognition and Perception, Professor Michael S. Landy; Community Psychology ,Associate Professor Diane Hughes; Social Psychology , Professor Yaacov Trope he Department of Psychology at New YorkUniversity approaches the study of the human mind and human behav-ior from many perspectives.Psychologists in the cognitionand perception program focus on perception, action, memory,attention, language, and think-ing. Social psychologists studypersuasion and attitude change,stereotyping and prejudice,judgment and decision making, and how relationships form anddevelop. Community psycholo-gists consider how social systemsand social context influence development and functioning. Graduate students in the department have the opportu-nity to obtain sophisticated training from these perspectives and to integrate the approachesin novel ways. At the doctorallevel, students select one of thethree specialty areas but candeclare a minor specialty in a second area or in quantitative psychology. In addition, stu- dents from all programs have the opportunity to focus ondevelopmental psychology,which is a cross-cutting concen- tration rather than a separateprogram. Developmental psy-chologists examine both cogni-tive and social functioning as itchanges over the life span. At the master's level, students have the opportunity to samplegraduate courses in a wide vari-ety of topics and may participatein tracks in either industrial/ organizational psychology or in general psychology. The department takes advan- tage of its location in the nation' spremier city by collabo - rating with important scientific institutions, community agen-cies, and corporations. NewYork provides access to almostany population or cultural group psychologists might choose to study. Experiences in this stimu- lating context supplement the department's emphasis on basicpsychological research.PSYCHOLOGY BUILDING 6 WASHINGTON PLACE 1965 (psychology), Pennsylvania; M.A. 1959 (mathematics education), Columbia;B.S. 1958 (mathematics), Maryland.

Admission tograduate study in psychology is basedonacademic records, Graduate Record Examination scores, and letters of rec-ommendation. A limited number ofnonmatriculants may be accepted foradmission to the Master of Arts pro-gram (see Nondegree Status, below). Each student is responsible for com- plying with all rules, regulations,requirements, and policies of theUniversity ,the Graduate School of Arts and Science, the Department ofPsychology ,and the program in which he or she is studying. MASTER OF ARTS The Master of Arts degree in psychol- ogy is offered to students wishing toimprove their status in a psychology-related occupation or to strengthentheir background in the field. ManyM.A. students plan for later pursuit ofthe Ph.D. degree. It should be empha-sized, however, that the M.A. programoffers a terminal degree. All studentswho wish to obtain a Ph.D. degree must apply directly to their programof choice during the Ph.D. applicationperiod (see under Doctor of Philosophy). Admission: Applicants seeking admission to a Master of Arts programin psychology should have graduatedfrom college with an average of B orbetter. All applicants must have com-pleted courses in introductory psychol-ogy and in introductory statistics withgrades of B or better to be eligible foradmission. All applicants must pro - vide a report from the general test of314 PSYCHOLOGYthe Graduate Record Examination (GRE) and achieve scores of at least530 in the verbal and at least 580 inthe quantitative sections as well as ascore of 4.5 or above in the analyticalwriting section. In addition, interna-tional applicants must achieve a score of at least 600 (250 for the computer-ized version) on the Test of English as aForeign Language (TOEFL). Applications are accepted for fall, spring, or summer admission. Programs of Study: Two programs of study are offered to M.A. degree can- didates: (1) general psychology, forstudents who wish to shape theircourse of study to fit special interestsand needs, and (2) industrial/or ganiza- tional (I/O) psychology, for thosewishing to expand their knowledge ofthe psychological principles and meth - ods useful in employee relations and human resources fields. Degree Requirements: Formal requirements for the M.A. degree inpsychology are the satisfactory com-pletion of 36 points (at least 27 in res-idence at New York University) andeither a written comprehensive exami - nation or a master's thesis. All stu- dents must pass Intermediate Master'sStatistics (G89.2016) or the equiva-lent. Students must pass substantivecore courses with a grade of B or bet-ter and must maintain an overall Baverage. The specific requirementswithin each program are listed below. General Program Requirements: Satisfactory completion of four core courses chosen from three core groups,as follows: a total of three from core A(G89.2010, andG89.2025) and core B (G89.2014,G89.2015, G89.2020, and G89.2034),such that each core is sampled, and one from core C (research: G89.2066, G89.2067, and G89.2126). Note: Students who are admitted without having majored in psychologyas undergraduates are required to com-plete a total of four courses from coreAand core B, such that each core is sampled. I/O Psychology Requirements: Satisfactory completion of G89.2032, two courses from core I (G89.2070,G89.2071, and G89.2073), twocourses from core O (G89.2072,G89.2074, and G89.2076), and aresearch course (normally G89.2067). Master's students are required to register for courses, request an officialleave of absence, or maintain matricu-lation each semester from the start oftheir academic career until graduation. The Master of Arts degree is also granted to students matriculated inthe doctoral program when they havemet the requirements for the degree asdefined by their program and by theGraduate School of Arts and Science. Courses at the M.A. level usually commence no earlier than 4:20 p.m.and no later than 6:20 p.m. The pro- gram may be completed on a part-time or full-time basis, providing that all course work and either a compre-hensive exam or thesis are completed within a five-year period. NONDEGREE STATUS An applicant with an undergraduate average of B or better may apply for admission as a nonmatriculated stu- dent, eligible to take 12 points of M.A.-level courses in general psychol - ogy (circle \"Nondegree\" at the top of the application form). Nondegree statusis not available for I/O students. A non-degree applicant should submit theapplication form and required subsec-tions, copies of all transcripts, and atleast one letter of recommendation. Allmaterial should be sent to the GraduateSchool of Arts and Science Office ofGraduate Enrollment Services. Nondegree students who wish to petition for admission to the M.A. pro-gram must satisfy any conditions setby the department and provide a reportfrom the general test of the GraduateRecord Examination that reflects a score of at least 530 in each section. Address inquiries to the Department ofPsychology ,New Y ork University, 6 Washington Place, New Y ork, NY 10003-6634; 212-998-7900. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The Doctor of Philosophy is a research- oriented degree. It signifies that therecipient is able to conduct independ-ent research and has a broad basicknowledge of psychology and a com-prehensive knowledge of a special area.Specialty programs include cognitionand perception, community psychol - ogy, and social psychology. Students may also choose to concentrate indevelopmental psychology in conjunc-tion with one of the other programs. Admission: Applicants to programs of study leading to the Ph.D. degree should have graduated from collegewith an outstanding under graduate record. An under graduate major in psychology is not required. The cogni- tion and perception program places aparticular emphasis on research experi-ence. The Graduate RecordExamination (GRE) general test isrequired of all applicants. The GRE psychology test is not required.Matriculants are admitted only in thefall term and only on a full-time basis.See also the Degree Requirements section of this bulletin. International appli-cants are also required to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language(TOEFL), including the writing test. Degree Requirements: Formal requirements for the doctorate in psy-chology include the satisfactory com- pletion of 72 points (at least 32 in residence at New York University); two terms of statistics (eitherG89.2228 and G89.2229, or coursesapproved by the student's program);satisfactory completion of an oral orwritten comprehensive examination, orthesis (requirements vary by program);and presentation of an acceptable dis - sertation. After completion of the required number of points, doctoralstudents maintain matriculation by feeeach semester until completion of thedissertation. Information regardingrequirements of the doctoral special-ization programs additional to the pre-ceding department requirementsshould be obtained from theDepartment of Psychology, New YorkUniversity, 6 Washington Place,Room 550, New York, NY 10003-6634; 212-998-7900. Five years of postbaccalaureate study are usually required to completethe Ph.D. degree; however, no morethan seven years may elapse and the completion ofall degree requirements. Continuationas a matriculant is contingent on thedemonstration of satisfactory progresstoward the doctorate. It cannot beoveremphasized that the accumulation of high grades in formal courses, whileimportant, is secondary to the comple- tion of research that contributes sig-nificantly to the field and is effectivelypresented in the dissertation. The Graduate School' sforeign lan - guage requirement has been waived for the Department of Psychology . DEPARTMENTAL PROGRAMS AND RESEARCH Cognition and Perception: Research programs in cognition and perception focus on seven (1) Inati, (Adolph,Johnson, Marcus); and (7) perceptionand action (Adolph, Landy, Maloney). Research in perception and atten- tion deals with the perception ofdepth, pattern, form, motion, color,and attentional processes to various dimensions. Psychophysical methods and computer modeling of visualprocesses are employed. Research inmemory and cognition deals with rea-soning, categorization, verbal andauditory information processing,short- and long-term memory, con-scious and unconscious processes inmemory, and visual cognition.Research in language and psycholin-guistics deals with reading, syntacticand semantic structures, and issues ofmodularity. Physiological projects in the cognition and perception program benefit from the fact that many of itsfaculty are also members of New YorkUniversity's Center for Neural Science(CNS) and Center for Brain - rophysiology of vision, visual develop - ment, and visual attention. Learningprojects involve both operant proce-dures with animals and behavioraltechniques in human learning. Currentresearch in human developmentincludes the development of visuomo - tor skills, conceptual development,perception, and acquisition of lan- guage. Current research in perception and action concerns movement plan-ning in adults and children. Training for research begins when students enter the program and culmi-nates in the doctoral thesis. Studentsbecome active members of one of the productive research laboratories associ- ated with the program, facilitatingcontact with faculty members,advanced students, and postdoctoralscientists. Teaching experience isgained through assistantships thatsupplement research training. Recentgraduates have taken positions in avariety of academic, pure research, andapplied research settings. The Centerfor Neural Science offers opportunitiesto students in the cognition and per-ception program to participate in neu-ral science courses along with studentsof the Center and, in some cases, towork with faculty of the Center as well as affiliated faculty from theDepartments of Biology, Chemistry,Computer Science, Mathematics, andPhysics. There are weekly area seminars with prominent speakers in cognition andperception, developmental psychology,and neural science. Community Psychology: Community psychology is an action science. In the community psychology program at NYU, rigorous research, theory development, and preventiveinterventions are viewed as fundamen-tal to the search for solutions to cur-rent and future social problems.Throughout the first three years of theprogram, students take a variety of courses covering issues such as the conceptualization and measurement of transactions between people and set-tings, the design and implementationof preventive interventions, statistics,and methodology. They also completeaone-year supervised practicum in which they are engaged in communityaction. Students are involved in research throughout their academic career and publish articles and presentpapers in seminars and at nationalconferences. Students are funded withresearch assistantships, teaching assist-antships, and fellowships. NYU has been a part of community psychology since its inception as afield. The University's New York Citylocation provides students with oppor-tunities to focus on important issuesin the lives of diverse populations,including immigrant families, home-less adults and children, and raciallydiverse and gay and lesbian youth. Atpresent, faculty and student researchinterests include effects of homeless - ness on children and families, racial socialization practices within blackfamilies, school transitions amongurban adolescents, cultural differencesin adolescent parent-peer relationships,and HIV risk and prevention. Social Psychology: The social psy- chology program offers research train-ing within a unifying social-cognitionand social-interaction framework;ensures extensive training in advanced statistical techniques; and provides opportunities for active collaborationwith cognitive, developmental, andorganizational psychologists. Researchin the program is funded in part bygovernment grants, which contributeto the computerized laboratory envi - ronment as well as provide support formany students for their first four yearsin the program. All faculty are on edi- torial boards of major journals insocial, developmental, and personalitypsychology, and all have served as edi-tors of these journals as well. The program encourages faculty- student interaction, and students regu-larly present papers at regional andnational psychology association meet-ings. Recent graduates have joined thefaculty of major universities and havetaken positions in both public (e.g., medical schools) and private sectors. An active colloquium series regularlyfeatures leading figures from aroundthe world. Visiting faculty and post-doctoral students also contribute tostudents' training. Faculty research interests include attitudes and persuasion; automaticprocesses in social perception, motiva-tion, and behavior; affect and cogni-tion; developmental social cognition,sex roles, and social comparisonprocesses; judgment and decision mak- ing; relationships, health psychology , and stress; stereotyping and infer- ences; sex bias in work settings,dynamics of stereotyping, and conse-quences of preferential selection proce - dures; conflict and negotiation,mediation; and social justice, organiza-tional/social psychology, psychology ofauthority, legal psychology, and surveyresearch/field research. The social psy - chology laboratories provide com - puter -based experimental facilities to study cognitive, affective, and motiva-tional responses to social stimuli in acontrolled environment; a place forsocial interaction (either in person orover the Internet); rooms for smallgroups and personality research; andextensive computer facilities for data analysis and experiment preparation. There is also a large subject pool ofundergraduates each semester, anddiverse subject populations are avail-able off-site. See also Developmental Concentration, below . Developmental Concentration: The Department of Psychology at NewYork University offers a unique con-centration in developmental psychol-ogy. Students who participate in thedevelopmental concentration do sowithin one of the department's coreprograms (cognition and perception,community psychology, or social psy-chology). They engage in advanced- level seminars and research with faculty affiliated with both develop-mental psychology and their otherchosen field of interest. Therefore, stu-dents become experts in both develop-316 PSYCHOLOGYmental psychology and a specific con- tent area. The fact that the concentra- tion cuts across different areas of psychology assures that studentsreceive broad exposure to theories of development and methods of studyingdevelopmental change across a range of content areas. The link with a core psychology program ensures depth ofknowledge and expertise in a particu-lar content area. This approach offers students considerable flexibility as well as advantages when they enter thejob market. The department's interdisciplinary approach enables students to pursuebasic or applied programs. State-of-the-art lab facilities include powerfulnew technologies for observing,recording, and analyzing behaviors onafinely detailed or global basis. The University' slocation in lower Manhattan provides a unique opportu-nity to study developmental changesin a range of populations and commu-nities. Faculty study development ininfants, children, adolescents, andadults. They use a variety of method - ological approaches, from experimentallab studies and computational model-ing to intervention studies and epi - demiological surveys to diary studiesand naturalistic field research. Areas ofresearch include adolescent develop-ment, behavior regulation, cognition,computational modeling, culture andcognition, perceptual exploration, gen - der and ethnic identity, immigrant children, psychopathology ,homeless - ness and family functioning, languageacquisition, motor skill acquisition, racial socialization, and social referenc - ing. Students can also receive training in advanced methods and statistics rel-evant to studying developmentalprocesses. Students pursue a specific course of study in developmental psychologywithin the required curriculum oftheir core psychology program. They attend and present their research at a weekly seminar in developmental psy-chology. This seminar provides a stim-ulating forum in which both facultyand students discuss their research.Nationally renowned scholars are alsoinvited to present their research at theseminar, and students have the oppor-tunity to discuss their work with them. The developmental concentra- tion at New York University is certi- fied by New York State and willtherefore be registered on the student's transcript. Quantitative Psychology: Quantitative psychology involves mathematical representations of behavioral data, using statistical analy-sis and mathematical models of psy-chological phenomena. All areas ofpsychology can be approached from aquantitative perspective, so it is possi-ble to pursue a quantitative specializa-tion from any of the doctoral specialtyprograms. To qualify for the quantitative spe- cialization, students take electivecourses in advanced statistical and/ormathematical topics and demonstrate an ability to communicate mathemati - cal approaches clearly . SUMMER TEACHING PRACTICUM Advanced doctoral graduate students are invited to apply to participate inthis supervised teaching experience.Selected students serve as adjunctinstructors for undergraduate summerschool courses. Applicants are admit-ted to the program on the basis oftheir seniority in their doctoral train - ing programs, their relevant experi-ence as teaching assistants, theappropriateness of the training fortheir career objectives, and their stand-ing in their graduate programs. FACILITIES The Department of Psychology main- tains laboratories, classrooms, project rooms, and a magnetic resonance (MR)neuroimaging facility in an 11-storybuilding near W ashington Square Park. Modern laboratories are continu - ally improved through grants fromfoundations and federal agencies. The Center for Brain Imaging houses a dedicated 3-tesla SiemensAllegra MR system for the use of fac-ulty and students interested in researchusing functional brain imaging. Thecenter includes faculty members fromboth the Department of Psychology and the Center for Neural Science.The department maintains com- puter classrooms and laboratories. Faculty laboratories are equipped with specialized computer equipmentwithin each of the graduate programs. The department collaborates closelywith the Center for Neural Science in maintaining a technical shop for com- puter and network support as well asthe development of specialized elec-tronics. There is also a fully equipped machine shop. DEPARTMENTAL FINANCIAL AID Students admitted to the doctoral pro- gram are funded through a combina- tion of fellowships, research and teaching assistantships, and training grants. These funding mechanisms cover tuition and provide a stipend.Doctoral students in good standing aresupported for five years (typically fouryears with a master's in psychology).In addition, summer research stipendsare available. In conjunction with financial aid packages, doctoral students are askedto serve as teaching assistants to fac-ulty who teach under graduate psychol - ogy courses or graduate statistics courses. Workshops on effective teach-ing methods and support for first-timeassistants are provided. Depending onthe sources of financial aid, doctoralstudents have two to five semesters ofteaching experience over the first tensemesters. Advanced students who have com- pleted at least 12 points in the Masterof Arts programs may request teachingassistant assignments, which providestipends. These assignments are madeon a competitive basis. Departmentalfellowship and scholarship support is not available to students in the Master of Arts programs. Acomprehensive list of University, Graduate School, and departmentalfellowships, prizes, and awards appearsin the Financing Graduate Education section of the GSAS Application for Admission and Financial Aid.CoursesCourses numbered between G89.1016 and G89.2199 are primarily forMaster of Arts students and are sched-uled in the evening, enabling theworking student to attend on a part-time basis. Other courses, for studentsin the doctoral program, are scheduledin the morning or afternoon. Notevery course is offered each term.

A doctoral degree from a program in clinical psychology or a related areaof study. 2. Two years of supervised experience in individual adult psychotherapy. 3. Eligibility for state certification/licensing in a mentalhealth discipline. PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS Personal Analysis: Candidates are required to complete 300 hours of per-sonal analysis at a minimum of threesessions per week. This analysis mustbegin prior to initiating work with aclinic patient, and it must be concur-rent with at least one year of the treat - ment of a clinic patient. The candidate's training analyst must havehad, at the commencement of the can-didate's analysis, five years of experi-ence following graduation from ananalytic training program. Moderate-cost psychoanalysis is made availableto students by many members of thefaculty .For further information regarding moderate-cost analysis, can- didates may speak with the programdirector, Dr. Lewis Aron.Curriculum: Candidates must satis- factorily complete 36 points of coursework, chosen with the guidance of fac - ulty from among the program's diverseareas of study. Enrollment in a mini-mum of one course per semester isrequired. The program begins with a two-semester sequence covering the major psychoanalytic orientations, an introduction to clinical psychoanalysis, and principles of ethics. The centralthrust of the program is to afford can-didates the opportunity to study with faculty representing major orientations in psychoanalytic theory and practice.Students are therefore encouraged totake courses reflecting differing pointsof view and to work with supervisorswho have diverse theoreticalapproaches. However, since some indi- viduals apply to the program so that they may work within one orientation,the program provides several options.The student may select a systematiccourse of study in a modern Freudian,an interpersonal, or a relational orien - tation. Alternatively ,the student may choose to combine courses from thethree orientations, as well as coursesnot aligned with any particular one(independent). The curriculum thusfosters an intellectual community inwhich theoretical diversity may thriveand a rigorous comparative psycho - analysis is encouraged. Clinical Requirements: The candi- date is required to conduct psycho-analysis for 400 hours under thesupervision of the Postdoctoral Clinic.The candidate is expected to workwith at least three clinical supervisors,for a minimum total of 160 hours; each supervisor must be seen for at least 40 hours. Candidates are to begin work with a clinic patient by the beginning of their second year in theprogram, and they are to continueclinic work until the requirement of work with two patients at 200 hours each is met. In performing the clinicrequirement, students are expected tofollow all guidelines outlined in thePostdoctoral Clinic's policy and proce-dures manual, which is updated regu-larly. Students write progress reports on their clinic patients toward the end of each academic year. Evaluation: Candidates are evaluated by faculty following completion ofeach course and by supervisors follow-ing each supervisory experience.Candidates' progress is monitored bythe Progression Committee, whichmay require additional course work,supervision, clinical experience, or per - sonal analysis. Postdoctoral Clinic: The Postdoctoral Clinic is the clinical facility for thetraining program. It is designed toPsychotherapy and PsychoanalysisNYU POSTDOCTORAL PROGRAM IN 324 PSYCHOTHERAPY AND PSYCHOANALYSISDIRECTOR OF THE PROGRAM: Lewis Aron, Ph.D. heprogram is designed to pro-vide advanced education of post- doctoral mental health profession - als in the theory and practice ofpsychotherapy and psychoanaly- sis. Established in 1961 for psy-chologists who at that time found it difficult to obtain formal train-ing in psychoanalysis, the New York University PostdoctoralProgram in Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis was the first psy-choanalytic training programsponsored by a university gradu - ate school of arts and science. It is now the largest psychoanalytictraining program in the country . The program offers a diverse curriculum, comprising modern Freudian, interpersonal, rela- tional, and independent orienta-tions, and it is unique in offering comprehensive training in thesevarious schools. Each orientation has an internationally knownteaching faculty and outstandingclinical supervisors. Contempo-rary thepostdoctoral program' scommu - nity of scholars and practitioners has made a significant contribu- tion to the field.715 BROADWAY , 1ST alimited of individuals unableto afford private fees.

Selected Courses FREUDIAN AREA OF STUDY This curriculum encompasses the fun- damental discoveries of Sigmund Freud and the diversity of viewpoints in theory and technique that character- izes Freudian psychoanalysis as it ispracticed today .This diversity arises both from the proliferation of ideas within ego psychology and from theincreasing influence of studies of childdevelopment, of self psychology ,and of theories of the self in relationship to the object world. The program is suchthat one can take Freudian training inany desired proportion in relation to the overall postdoctoral program. It is also possible to participate in a struc-tured Freudian program, with guaran - teed access to a planned sequence ofcourses. Candidates are welcome tocontact the chair of the faculty in theFreudian area of study ,Dr.Jo Lang ( jpjlw@aol.com ), to discuss individual questions and planning.

INTERPERSONAL AREA OF STUDY Interpersonal theory rests upon a broad framework of implicit and explicitpremises that departed from the psy-choanalysis of its day and that contin-ues to reflect its unique contributionto the current psychoanalytic move-ment. An individual's experience,acquired in the context of interactionswith others, becomes the focus of ana-lytic inquiry. Central to interpersonalanalysis is the direct engagement ofanalyst and patient in their actual and immediate experience of each other . Interpersonal theory posits a variety ofinfluences that produce diverse andindividualizing effects upon the per - son. However, no assumptions aremade about any preordained event orconstellation of events as being pri-mary determinants of experience. Inthis way, the uniqueness of each patient, each therapist, and each ana- lytic dyad is emphasized. Great impor-tance is placed on an understanding ofcharacter formation through an explo-ration of the interplay of interpersonal interaction with the social and cultural factors that provide the context in which this interaction is embedded.

RELATIONAL AREA OF STUDY Over the past several decades, a basic theoretical and clinical paradigm hasemerged within various psychoanalytic traditions that is fundamentally differ- ent from that which underlies classicalpsychoanalytic thought. The new per - spective includes and cuts across recentdevelopments within the British schoolof object relations, American interper-sonal psychoanalysis, self psychology , and currents within Freudian ego psy-chology. The curriculum is organizedaround three levels of course work; it is based on courses sponsored by the rela- tional faculty and augmented by othercourses in the program. Candidates whoare interested in pursuing this orienta - tion are encouraged to consult with members of the relational faculty withthe goal of setting up an individuallytailored curriculum.

Weinclude three related approaches: examination of pri-mary texts and artifacts; analysis of the ideas and activities that have contributed to the develop-ment of various religions; andinterdisciplinary exploration of the theories and methods used in the study of religion. It should be stressed that the M.A. in religious studies is orientedtoward the academic analysis of religious phenomena and is not intended to promote or endorse either religious belief itself orthe views and practices of any particular religious tradition. The program utilizes resources from several areas of study inthe Graduate School of Arts and Science (including theDepartments of Anthropology,Classics, English, Hebrew and Judaic Studies, History, Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies, andPhilosophy ,and the Program in Medieval and RenaissanceStudies) and in the Tisch School of the Arts (the Department of Performance Studies). The pro-gram also has close ties to theCenter for Religion and Media.Courses that originate in these programs and departments are made available to graduate reli- gious studies students throughcross-listing or departmental permission. This allows studentsto develop a solid foundation incomparative religions and theo-ries and/or to focus on a specific area of study .Students are wel - come to use the library of NYU's Hagop Kevorkian Center for their advanced research. It should be noted thatmost courses are offered duringthe day or early evening hours.Students who pursue the gradu- ate program on a full-time basis (12 points per semester) com-plete the program in two years. 726 BROADWAY , SUITE 554 NEW YORK, on admission to the graduate Program in ReligiousStudies are based on several factors.Undergraduate transcripts, GraduateRecord Examination (GRE) test results,letters of recommendation, writing sample, and the personal statement are some of the materials seriously consid-ered during the decision-makingprocess.

Wu DIRECTOR OF GRADUATE STUDIES: Assistant Professor Vivek Chibber he Department of Sociology empha-sizes both theoret- ical creativity and substantive empirical researchon important social issues. It encourages a range of analytic perspectives and maintainsstrength in both quantitativeand qualitative methods. Thegraduate program complements research on the contemporary United States\u2014including NewYork City\u2014with internationaland historical studies. Among its areas of strength are genderstudies; social inequality; crime, law, ethnicity; culture; and theory. In addition to formal course work, the department offers stu- dents a chance to participate incollaborative research projectsthrough its apprenticeship pro- gram. This gives students an early research experience andleads NYU faculty and studentsto publish an unusually high number of coauthored papers. Students also have access to thedepartment' sextensive computer resources. The department organizes five continuing public researchworkshops, where faculty and students present and criticizeeach other's works in progress, encouraging professional collab-oration and exchange. These workshops are (1) Politics,Power, and Protest; (2) Gender and Inequality; (3) Crime, Law,and Deviance; (4) PoliticalEconomy; and (5) Culture, Institutions, and Social Change.The department also organizesan active program of colloquia, conferences, and speakers, and graduate students themselvesorganize a conference each year. To prepare students interested in careers as college and univer- sity teachers, the departmentoffers training in the teaching ofsociology .This includes a teach - ing practicum and a graduated program of practical experiencein which students work as teaching assistants with increas - ing levels of responsibility.269 MERCER STREET NEW YORK, NY 10003-6687 212-998-8340 WEB SITE: TThomas Ertman, Associate Professor.

FACUL TY EMERITI Eliot Freidson, Wolf Sexton, Dennis H.Wrong. 334 SOCIOLOGYSOCIOLOGY 335Admission: All applicants must take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) general test. Grade and Point Requirements: Graduate School requirements are described in the Degree Requirements section of this bulletin. The Department of Sociology requires allgraduate students to maintain a grade average of B or better in order toremain in good standing. All studentsmust complete at least 12 points persemester in letter-graded work in theDepartment of Sociology (unless thedirector of graduate studies gives spe-cial permission to do otherwise), until they complete the Ph.D. comprehen- sive examinations. To obtain detailed information on the current requirements, standards, examinations, and course offerings, visit the department Web site or con-tact the department graduate secretary.As the department is constantly devel-oping its program, some of the infor - mation provided here may besuperseded. All students must meetthe current official requirements avail-able from the department. MASTER OF AR TS While the graduate program is a Ph.D. program, it does offer continu - ing students a Master of Arts degree.The program does not admit studentsfor a terminal M.A. degree. Formalrequirements for the Master of Artsdegree in sociology are the satisfactorycompletion of graduate studies total - ing at least 36 points (at least 24 in residence at New York Universitywith at least a B average) and either athesis or a comprehensive examination.At least 24 of the points must be insociology. The courses must includethree basic sociology courses, one basictheory course, Methods and Statistics I(G93.2331), and one additional meth - ods course. There is no language requirement for the M.A. degree in sociology . DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The Doctor of Philosophy is a research degree. It signifies that the recipientcan conduct independent research, has abroad basic knowledge of sociology, andhas a comprehensive knowledge of atleast two chosen areas of specialization. General Course Requirements: In addition to the requirements describedabove under Grade and Point Requirements, Ph.D. requirementsinclude 72 points of graduate work (at least 36 in residence at New York University). At least 48 of the pointsrequired for the Ph.D. degree must be in regular sociology courses. Up to 12 of the remaining 24 points may be reading or dissertation courses that involve indi-vidual work with a member of the fac- ulty. The acceptability of courses outsidesociology depends on the relevance of the work to sociology as judged by the department. Credit for work done else-where requires the approval of the direc-tor of graduate studies. In addition, aminimum of 4 points in a regular, listedseminar (any 3000-level course except reading and dissertation courses) must be included among the 72 points for the Ph.D. degree. Methods and Statistics Requirement: Ph.D. students must pass with a B or better two semestersof the Methods and Statistics sequenceand one course satisfying the \"secondmethods course requirement.\" T ransfer students should see the director ofgraduate studies when first registeringin order to determine what coursesmay be required of them. Theory Requirement: The depart - ment requires that all students becomefamiliar with major sociological theo-ries and theoretical reasoning. Thisrequirement is fulfilled with one basicand one advanced theory course, withat least a B in each. Basic Course Requirement: This requirement aims to ensure that stu - dents receive a strong base of knowl - edge in selected subfields of sociology.Students early in their career benefit from learning the basics of an area, as organized by experts currently work-ing in it. This training facilitates stu - dents' abilities to engage in research inthe area and aids them as they preparetheir areas for the Ph.D. comprehen - sive examination. T omeet this requirement, students must achieve a Bor better in each of two departmen- tal 2000-level courses, excluding those2000-level courses in theory andmethods. Research Paper Requirement: This requirement aims to ensure that allstudents gain research experience earlyin their graduate student career .The paper is written, ordinarily during the second year of study, under the guid- ance of a faculty supervisor and mustbe approved as well by a second reader.Ph.D. Comprehensive Examination: The required two written examina- tions are organized around areas thatthe student has studied in consultation with members of the faculty. These two written examinations should be taken by the end of the third year offull-time study. The examination process tests the student's knowledgeofthese two areas of study and his or her ability to draw on the discipline as awhole in applying both theory and research methodology to social prob-lems. Dissertation: The proposal for the dissertation and the dissertation itself are researched and written in consulta- tion with a committee of at least three advisers. Upon approval of the advis- ers, the dissertation is defended before an examining committee of five fac - ulty members (including the three dis-sertation advisers). At least fouraffirmative votes are required for pass-ing a dissertation defense. Time Limits: All requirements must be completed within ten years of the inception of graduate study, or seven years from return to graduate study ifthe candidate holds the master' sdegree at the time of readmission. Extensionsof this time limit, if granted, are usu-ally conditional. It cannot be overemphasized that the accumulation of high grades in formalcourses, while important, is secondaryto the demonstration of the capacityfor original thinking and to the com - pletion of research that contributessignificantly to the field and is effec-tively presented in publications and the dissertation. RESEARCH APPRENTICESHIPS The Department of Sociology has a system of research apprenticeships forgraduate students. Students takingthese apprenticeships work as profes - sors' research assistants, usually fortwo semesters. These apprenticeshipsoffer students intensive research expe-rience and often lead to coauthorshipof published work. Students mayreceive up to 24 points of credittoward Ph.D. course requirements forapprenticeships. The first 8 points ofcredit (G93.2321, 2322) can count as part of the 48 points students need in regular sociology courses. Additionalapprenticeship credit (G93.2323,2324, 2325, 2326) must count againstthe 24 points allowed toward the doc-toral degree from the combination ofPrograms and Requirements336 SOCIOLOGYapprenticeship, reading, dissertation, and outside courses. The departmentencourages students to take researchapprenticeships. See the department'sofficial statement on research appren-ticeships for more details.DEPARTMENTAL FELLOW- SHIPS, PRIZES, AND AWARDS Acomprehensive list of University, Graduate School, and departmentalfellowships, prizes, and awards appearsin the Financing Graduate Education section of the GSAS Application for Admission and Financial Aid.

Each department establishes its stan- dards for admission. Successful appli- cants have distinguished academic records, strong recommendations from instructors or others qualified to evalu- ate academic ability, and well-articu-lated research goals. The GraduateSchool requires all applicants to takethe Graduate Record Examination(GRE) except for the Draper Program,which recommends but does notrequire the GRE. Each applicant is con-sidered without regard to gender, race,ethnicity, religion, age, national origin,sexual orientation, or physical disabil - ity.The GSAS Application Appendix includes additional requirements for some departments. Registration at New Y ork University requires notification of admission by the Graduate School's Graduate Enrollment Services office. Permission to study inthe Graduate School of Arts and Sciencedoes not imply admission to degree can-didacy .Other sections of this bulletin outline these requirements. Although New Y ork University confers the M.A. and Ph.D. in per - formance studies and cinema studies through the Graduate School of Arts and Science, the Tisch School of theArts administers these programs.Applicants to these departments areurged to read the Tisch School of the Arts Bulletin and should direct all questions and correspondence to the Office ofGraduate Admissions, T isch School of the Arts, New York University, 721 Broadway, 8th Floor, New York, NY10003-6807; 212-998-1918; e-mail: tisch.gradadmissions@nyu.edu. For detailed information regarding the admissions process and require - ments, applicants should consult the Graduate School of Arts and Science Appli - cation for Admission and Financial Aid, which is available on the Web site at www.nyu.edu/gsas/Admissions/AdmApp.html .Applicants are encouraged to apply online at www.nyu.edu/gsas/online.

INFORMA TION FOR INTERNATIONAL APPLICANTS The Graduate School expects all stu- dents to demonstrate the ability tounderstand and communicate in Eng-lish, both orally and in written form. Toevaluate proficiency, the school requiresapplicants whose native language is not English to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). The Grad-uate School recommends that the appli-cant achieve a minimum TOEFL scoreof 250 on the computer -based test (600 on the paper-based test). The GraduateSchool does not prohibit applicants withlower scores from applying for admis - sion since many factors influence theadmission decision. Some departmentsor programs in the Graduate Schoolmay set a higher TOEFL standard for admission. Information about the TOEFL may be obtained by writing directly toTOEFL Services, Educational TestingService, P .O. Box 6151, Princeton, NJ 08541-6151, U.S.A., or by visitingtheir Web site at www.toefl.org. Official TOEFL test score reports are required.When requesting that official scorereports be sent to the Graduate Schoolby the TOEFL Program, the applicantshould list the Graduate School of Artsand Science, school code 2596. Because English proficiency is essential to a student's success in theGraduate School, additional testingmay be performed when a studentarrives in New York. Occasionally, theschool requires a student to register fornoncredit English courses that entailadditional expense and extend thetime normally required to completethe student's degree. Applicants in the New York area may take, in lieu of the TOEFL, theEnglish proficiency test at the Univer-sity's American Language Institute, located at 48 Cooper Square, Room 200, New York, NY 10003-7154,U.S.A.

This requiredprogram provides the opportunity for (1) the development and testing of English language competencies in theclassroom environment and (2) the exploration of cultural differences in the United States and the nature ofNYU's exceptional multicultural base.Participants explore communications strategies that will enable them tosuccessfully manage the classroom and interact with students. The program isusually scheduled for several days atthe end of August, before fall-termclasses begin, and if determined bylanguage testing, continues with lan - guage course or tutorial work during the fall semester. Students who do notsuccessfully complete the programmay be required to complete addi-tional work on language before beingpermitted to assume teaching respon-sibilities. Questions about the pro-gram should be directed to thedirector of graduate studies in the stu-dent's department or to (fax); e-mail: neil.williams@nyu.edu. all departments, an offer of admis- sion to the Graduate School permits astudent to enroll for the first timeonly in the term of entry for which sheor he was specifically admitted. If a student declines an offer of admis- sion or does not register for the expectedterm, the Graduate School requires anew application. In some departmentsthe director of graduate studies (DGS)will grant an extension to the student with the approval of the Graduate School. As additional credentials may berequired by the Graduate School in suchcases, students should consult withGraduate Enrollment Services. ADMISSION FOR SPECIAL STUDENT STATUS Occasionally an applicant will demon - strate a particular need to study at the Graduate School without entering anNYU GSAS degree program. A few special students are permitted to regis-ter each year as nondegree students,auditors, or visiting students. Applicants should contact the department of interest before applying, to confirm that special students are considered for admission into the pro-gram. International applicants shouldconsult with an adviser in GraduateEnrollment Services before making thedecision to apply to be sure that theplanned course of study will be appro-priate for the issuance of a visa. Applicants for special student status must complete the application for admission and must provide proof thathe or she holds a baccalaureate degreeand have earned a GPA of at least 3.0. GRE scores are not required. Appli- cants must meet the same applicationdeadlines as students who seek degrees.Students may enroll for a maximum of12 points of credit over not more thanthree consecutive semesters.

Graduate stu- dents may either nominate themselvesor be nominated by the chair of theirdepartment. Criteria for selectioninclude a promising academic record,the capacity for innovative thinking,the ability to contribute to interdisci -plinary inquiry, and an interest in the new technologies of education. Stu-dent membership in the forum is for aterm of two academic years (unless astudent graduates earlier). The Graduate Forum usually meets onthe last Wednesday evening of each month during the academic year. Stu- dent members are expected to make formal presentations of their work to each other in ways that further theaims of the forum, including the cir-culation of their papers or other mate-rials prior to discussion at meetingsand the posting of edited forum pro-ceedings and related resources on theWeb. The members of the forum alsocontribute to the regular evaluationand redesign of the forum's format. Starting in 2005, a second group, the IFA-GSAS Forum, was established by the Institute of Fine Arts and the Graduate School to enable interdisci-plinary inquiry into \"forms of seeing.\"With support from the Provost's Office and the IFA Alumni Associa-tion, this forum also has ten members,five from the IFA and five from othergraduate programs throughout NewYork University, and meets monthly. The IFA-GSAS Forum culminates in a year-end symposium at which all stu- dent participants present their research to the wider University community and public. The great public servant John W . Gardner contrasts two forms of insti-tutional behavior, the nurturing of\"seedbeds\" versus the intolerance of\"dead wood.\" The Graduate Schoolhopes its Graduate Forums will estab-lish, nurture, and cultivate a seedbedthat will in turn foster innovative andcreative thinkers.Financing Graduate Education 354 FINANCING GRADUATE EDUCATIONInstructions for Financial Aid ApplicantsThe application for admission is also the application for all GraduateSchool fellowships for new stu - dents. No additional forms are required. An application must be received by the specified deadline date to be eligi - ble for Graduate School and depart-mental fellowships and assistantships.Refer to the departmental deadlinedates in the GSAS Application Appendix. For many departments, the applica- tion deadline for admission and fund-ing is January 4. However ,several departments have a December 15 finaldeadline date, and others have a Decem- ber 15 recommended date along with the January 4 final deadline date. Toallow these departments adequate time to review applications for admission andfinancial aid, applicants shouldendeavor to have allmaterials submit - ted to the Graduate School no laterthan December 15. Guidelines for continuing students are available from departmental advisersin advance of the established deadline. The Graduate School encourages all U.S. citizens and permanent residents tocomplete the Free Application for Fed - eral Student Aid (FAFSA) to be consid-ered for all forms of federal and state aid, including the Federal W ork-Study Program and the various federal andprivate loan programs. NYU prefersthat the FAFSA be submitted online bylinking to www.fafsa.ed.gov (paper F AF- SAs are available in January from the University Office of Financial Aid). TheFAFSA should be filed after January 1,2006, but preferably before March 1,2006, for fall 2006 enrollment. Stu - dents should give permission for appli- cation data to be sent to New YorkUniversity (enter institution code 002785 in the \"T itle IV Code\" space).he of theGraduate Schoolof Arts and Sci- ence seeks to ensure that all aca-demically qualified studentshave enough financial support toenable them to work towardtheir degree.

Other Financial Aid\u2014Federal, State, and Private ProgramsELIGIBILITY To be considered for financial aid, stu- dents must be officially admitted toNYU or matriculated in a degree pro-gram and making satisfactory academicprogress toward degree requirements.Generally, University-administered fed-eral and state financial aid programs areawarded to full-time students. Half-timestudents (fewer than 12 but at least 6points of credit per semester) may be eli - gible for a federal Stafford Student Loan,but they must also maintain satisfactoryacademic progress. A full description ofthe NYU academic progress require-ments is available at www.nyu.edu/ financial.aid/progress_grad.html. University-administered federal and state awards are not automaticallyrenewed each year. Continuing stu- dents must submit a Renewal FAFSAeach year by the NYU deadline.Renewal depends on the annual reeval-uation of a student's need, the avail-ability of funds, the successfulcompletion of the previous year, and satisfactory progress toward the com - pletion of degree requirements. In order to be eligible for aid from federal and state government sources,students must be classified either asU.S. citizens or as eligible noncitizens(as defined by the U.S. Department ofEducation). It is the student's responsibility to supply true, accurate and completeinformation on the F AFSA and to notify the Office of Financial Aidimmediately of any changes or correc -tions in his or her housing status or financial situation, including tuitionremission benefits or outside grants,once the application has been made.Determination of financial need is alsobased on the number of courses forwhich the student registers. A change in registration therefore may necessi - tate an adjustment in financial aid. NEW YORK ST ATE TUITION ASSIST ANCE PROGRAM (TAP) Legal residents of the state of New York who are enrolled in a full-time degree program of at least 12 creditpoints a term, or the equivalent, maybe eligible for awards under this pro-gram. The Graduate School requiresall eligible financial aid applicants toapply for this grant. The TAP award replaces a portion of the tuition fel-lowship amount for students whoreceive full tuition grants. Studentsapplying for TAP must do so via aFAFSA application. VETERANS BENEFITS Various Department of Veterans Affairs programs provide educational benefitsfor sons, daughters, and spouses ofdeceased or permanently disabled vet-erans as well as for veterans and in-service personnel who served on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces after January 1, 1955. In these programs,the amount of benefits varies. Since interpretation of regulations governing veterans benefits is subjectto change, veterans and their depend-ents should keep in touch with the Department of V eterans Affairs.

FEDERAL LOANS Subsidized Stafford Student Loan (SSL) Program The subsidized federal Stafford Stu - dent Loan Program provides low-inter - est student loans using the capital oflending institutions and the adminis-trative facilities of state agencies.These loans are made by independentbanks or lending institutions and aregenerally insured by both the state andfederal governments. Agraduate student may borrow up to a maximum of $8,500 per year withatotal aggregate borrowing limit (including undergraduate loans) of $65,500. Within these limits, stu- dents may borrow up to the differencebetween the cost of education, thefamily contribution, and the total ofall financial aid awards. For graduatestudents, family contribution is basedon the incomes of the student andspouse (if married). The subsidized Stafford Student Loan interest rate for all students is variable with a cap of 8.25 percent. Interestdoes not accrue, however, nor doesrepayment begin, until six months afterthe borrower ceases to enroll at leasthalf time. An insurance premium of upto 1 percent as well as an originationfee of up to 3 percent will generally bededucted from the loan funds.Unsubsidized Stafford Student Loan Program The unsubsidized federal Stafford Stu- dent Loan Program provides additionalloan eligibility beyond any subsidized Stafford amounts. Students must first apply for the regular (subsidized) Stafford program, and if they meet eli-gibility criteria they will be automati- cally considered for the unsubsidizedprogram. Terms and conditions areessentially the same as for the regularStafford loan, except the federal govern-ment does not pay the interest on theunsubsidized loan while the student isin school. Students must begin to repayinterest and principal 60 days after thefirst loan funds are issued. Payment ofthe principal may be deferred if the stu-dent is enrolled at least half time forthe period of the loan. Also, the interestcan be \"capitalized\" (added to the prin-cipal) if desired. Graduate students may borrow up to a total of $18,500 in combined sub-sidized and unsubsidized Stafford loanseach academic year, although no morethan $8,500 of the $18,500 can be inthe form of a subsidized loan. Thetotal amount of unsubsidized Staffordloan in any academic year may notexceed the cost of education minus thetotal family contribution and minusall other financial aid (including subsi-dized Stafford loans) received that year . PRIV ATE LOANS Avariety of private student loan pro- grams are available to both U.S. andinternational students attending NYU.Created to supplement federal andinstitutional aid, they feature attractive terms and interest rates, and all credit- worthy families facing college expensesare eligible. There are no maximumincome limits. Loans are made throughbanks, savings and loan organizations, and other lenders. For more informa- tion, contact the Office of FinancialAid or visit their Web site. EMPLOYEE EDUCA TION PLANS Many companies pay all or part of the tuition of their employees undertuition refund plans. Employed stu-dents attending the University shouldask their personnel officers or training directors about the existence of a com- pany tuition plan. Students whoreceive tuition reimbursement andNYU employees who receive tuitionremission from NYU must notify theOffice of Financial Aid if they receivethis benefit.EMPLOYMENT Students considering employment that would require a significant portion oftheir time should discuss their planswith a Graduate Enrollment Servicescounselor. Students on full-funding support must obtain the permission of adepartmental representative and the dean of the Graduate School if theywish to secure employment beyond the requirements of their financial aidaward. Students who study at the Graduate School on temporary visas should fullyunderstand the regulations concerningpermissible employment under thosevisas. Before making plans for employ- ment in the United States, interna- tional students should consult with the Office for International Studentsand Scholars, New York University, 561 La Guardia Place, New York, NY10012-1402; 212-998-4720; e-mail: intl.students.scholars@nyu.edu.

WITHDRAWAL AND REFUND OF TUITION Arefund of tuition will be made by the Office of the Bursar after presenta - tion of a withdrawal (Change of Pro - gram) form signed by a departmentaladviser and approved for refund by thedean of the Graduate School of Artsand Science through Graduate Enroll-ment Services, provided such with - drawal is filed within the scheduledrefund period for the term, which isstated below .Withdrawal does not necessarily entitle the student to a FINANCING GRADUATE EDUCATION 357refund of tuition paid or a cancellation of tuition still due. An application for refund may be filed in person or by mail and must bemade in writing on the Change ofProgram form, obtainable in thedepartmental offices of the school. An official withdrawal must be filed if a course has been canceled and, in this case, the student is entitled to a refund of tuition and fees. Ceasing to attend a class does not constitute official withdrawal, nordoes notification to the instructor. A stop payment of a check presented for tuition does not constitute with-drawal, and it does not reduce thefinancial obligation to the University.The nonreturnable registration fee andapenalty fee of $10.00 for a stopped payment will be charged in addition to any tuition not canceled. The date on which the Change of Program form is filed, not the last date of attendance in class, is considered the official date of the student's with- drawal. It is this date that serves as thebasis for computing any refundgranted the student. The refund period (see schedule below) is defined as the first four cal - endar weeks of the term for which theapplication for withdrawal is filed. Noapplication filed after the fourth weekwill be considered. The processing ofrefunds takes approximately twoweeks. Refund Schedule for Fall and Spring Terms This schedule is based on the total applicable charge for tuition excludingnonreturnable fees and deposits. Withdrawal before the official opening date of the term 100% (100% of tuition and fees)* Withdrawal within the first calendar week from the opening date of the term 100% (100% of tuition only) The first calendar week consists of the first seven (7) calendar days beginning with the official opening date of the term. (Note: not the first day of the class meeting.) Withdrawal within the second calendar week from the opening date of the term 70% Withdrawal within the third calendar week from the opening date of the term 55% Withdrawal within the fourth calendar week from the opening date of the term 25% Withdrawal after completion of the fourth calendar week of the term NONE *After the official opening date of the term, the registration and services fee is notreturnable. Note: Astudent may not withdraw from a class the last three weeks of thefall or spring semester or the last threedays of each summer session. It should be noted that the registration and services fee is not returnable.Exceptions to the published refund schedule may be appealed in writingto the dean of the Graduate School ofArts and Science through GraduateEnrollment Services and should besupported by appropriate documenta-tion regarding the circumstances thatwarrant consideration of an exception,including approval by the departmen- tal director of graduate studies. Students who withdraw should review the Refunds page on the Office of the Bursar Web site at www.nyu .edu/bursar. Federal regulations require adjust- ments reducing financial aid if a stu-dent withdraws even after the NYUrefund period. Financial aid amountswill be adjusted for students whowithdraw through the ninth week of the semester and have received any federal grants or loans. This adjust-ment may result in the student' sbill not being fully paid. NYU will billthe student for this difference. The student will be responsible for pay- ment of this bill before returning toNYU and will remain responsible forpayment even if he or she does notreturn to NYU. Any semester during which a stu - dent is char ged even a single dollar in tuition will be taken into account when calculating the student'sprogress toward his or her degree. Thismay require the student to make upcredits before receiving any furtheraid. Students should review the \"satis-factory academic progress\" standardfor their program so they do not jeop-ardize future semesters of aid (www .nyu .edu/financial.aid/progress_grad.html). 358 FINANCING GRADUATE EDUCATIONSERVICES AND PROGRAMS 359Student Services GRADUATE ENROLLMENT SERVICES One-half admission who seek advice about programs of study at the Graduate School of Arts and Science or who need assistance with admission requirements for specific departmentsmay obtain information and guidancefrom Graduate Enrollment Services,One-half Fifth Avenue.

HENRY AND LUCY MOSES CENTER FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES 240 Greene Street, 2nd Floor Telephone: 212-998-4980 (voice and TTY) Web: www.nyu.edu/csd The Henry and Lucy Moses Center for Students with Disabilities providesservices to students with qualified dis-abilities within all the schools and col-leges of the University. The centerprovides services to students with hear - ing and visual impairments, mobilityimpairments, learning disabilities andattention deficit disorders, chronic ill - nesses, and psychiatric disorders. Stu - dent disability files presented to thecenter are confidential and are not partof a student's official academic recordsat NYU. In order to qualify for services and accommodations, a student must pres-ent appropriate, recent documentationof a disability and complete an intakeinterview with a counselor at the cen - ter. Services include the provision ofsign language interpreters, readers,notetakers, and other auxiliary aids. The center works in conjunction with academic and administrative depart-ments in providing assistance withexamination accommodations, regis-tration, and housing. Learning special - ists are available to provide one-on-one assistance to eligible students under the center's auspices. The center alsosponsors programs and workshops, aswell as the CHOICES career enhance-ment program. Limited tuition aid isavailable to qualified students. Students with disabilities, sup - ported by reasonable accommodations,must be able to function in their aca-demic and residential environments.Supported by such accommodations,they are expected to meet the require-ments and expectations of their aca-demic programs, to follow theestablished guidelines for securing andremaining in residential living space,and to adhere to University studentconduct and disciplinary codes. Students with disabilities must be able to function in as independentmanner as possible and to seek appro-priate assistance in a reasonable and timely manner.
