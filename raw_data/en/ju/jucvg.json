Background The 21st Century Cares Act established the Task Force for Research Specific to Pregnant and Lactating Women (PRGLAC) to provide advice and guidance to the HHS Secretary on activities related to identifying and addressing gaps in knowledge and research on safe and effective therapies for pregnant and lactating persons, including the development of such therapies and the collaboration on and coordination of such activities. Because so few studies have been conducted, some prioritization is necessary to determine which drugs, vaccines, and dietary supplements should be studied first. Nominations for the Priority List of Drug, Vaccine, and Dietary Supplement Research Needs for Pregnant, Postpartum, and Lactating Persons are solicited in furtherance of the recommendations outlined in the [2018 PRGLAC Report](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.nichd.nih.gov/sites/default/files/2018-09/PRGLAC_Report.pdf__;!!ELf_LxN3sEQ!f2We2rW3xkzaLB4W5QE5XmQuT0x8PvVa3qXMc5RQ8tqIw_S780BHsHQWxNRSgYs4VnoxFtm3TNKZva7f0frlitmeOZXEfMvfbgmsbA$) and [2020 PRGLAC Implementation Plan](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.nichd.nih.gov/sites/default/files/inline-files/PRGLAC_Implement_Plan_083120.pdf__;!!ELf_LxN3sEQ!f2We2rW3xkzaLB4W5QE5XmQuT0x8PvVa3qXMc5RQ8tqIw_S780BHsHQWxNRSgYs4VnoxFtm3TNKZva7f0frlitmeOZXEfMuk51i-JA$).
