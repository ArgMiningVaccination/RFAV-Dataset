Thus, in this work, we review the crystal chemistry of the family of uranyl selenite compounds, paying special attention to the pathways of synthesis and topological analysis of the known crystal structures. Comparison of the isotypic natural and synthetic uranyl-bearing compounds suggests that uranyl selenite mineral formation requires heating, which most likely can be attributed to the radioactive decay. Structural complexity studies revealed that the majority of synthetic compounds have the topological symmetry of uranyl selenite building blocks equal to the structural symmetry, which means that the highest symmetry of uranyl complexes is preserved regardless of the interstitial filling of the structures. Whereas the real symmetry of U-Se complexes in the structures of minerals is lower than their topological symmetry, which means that interstitial cations and H2O molecules significantly affect the structural architecture of natural compounds. At the same time, structural complexity parameters for the whole structure are usually higher for the minerals than those for the synthetic compounds of a similar or close organization, which probably indicates the preferred existence of such natural-born architectures. In addition, the reexamination of the crystal structures of two uranyl selenite minerals guilleminite and demesmaekerite is reported. As a result of the single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of demesmaekerite, Pb2Cu5[(UO2)2(SeO3)6(OH)6](H2O)2, the H atoms positions belonging to the interstitial H2O molecules were assigned. The refinement of the guilleminite crystal structure allowed the determination of an additional site arranged within the void of the interlayer space and occupied by an H2O molecule, which suggests the formula of guilleminite to be written as Ba[(UO2)3(SeO3)2O2](H2O)4 instead of Ba[(UO2)3(SeO3)2O2](H2O)3.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2019-11-30", "cleaned_text": "Crystal Chemistry and Structural Complexity of Natural and [ [7](#B7-crystals-09-00639)]. Their occurrence is limited to just a few localities. First, these are Musonoi and Shinkolobwe mines in DR Congo [ [6](#B6-crystals-09-00639)], two of the minerals were only found in the Repete mine (San Juan County, Utah, USA) [ [5](#B5-crystals-09-00639)], and a few more occurrences in Europe could be mentioned (small uranium deposit Z\u00e1les\u00ed in the Czech Republic, Liauzun in France, and La Creusaz U prospect in Switzerland) [ [8](#B8-crystals-09-00639)]. Nevertheless, apart from mineralogy, uranyl selenites are of great interest from the geochemical and radiochemical points of view. It is known that fission products contain 53 g per ton [ [9](#B9-crystals-09-00639)] of long-lived 79Se isotope with a half-life of 1.1 \u00d7 106 years [ [10](#B10-crystals-09-00639)] after three years of nuclear fuel irradiation in the reactor. Thus, an understanding of the processes of mineral formation in nature and their synthetic analogs in laboratories can help in the processing of nuclear wastes. Crystal chemical and structural investigations are key points in such a material's scientific studies due to the essential knowledge of how the variation in the chemical composition and growth conditions affects the crystal structure formation. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Occurrence 2.2. Single-Crystal X-Ray Diffraction Study [11](#B11-crystals-09-00639)]. The unit-cell parameters were refined using the least-squares techniques. The crystal structure of guilleminite was solved by a dual-space algorithm and refined using the SHELX programs [ [12](#B12-crystals-09-00639), [13](#B13-crystals-09-00639)] incorporated in the OLEX2 program package [ [14](#B14-crystals-09-00639)]. The final model includes coordinates and anisotropic displacement parameters for all non-H atoms. The H atoms of H2O molecules were localized from difference Fourier maps and were included in the refinement, with Uiso(H) set to 1.5Ueq(O) and O-H restrained to 0.95 \u00c5. [11](#B11-crystals-09-00639)]. The structure was solved by the charge-flipping algorithm [ [12](#B12-crystals-09-00639)] and refined using the Jana2006 program [ [15](#B15-crystals-09-00639)]. The final refinement cycles were undertaken considering all atoms (except of hydrogen) refined with anisotropic atomic displacement parameters. The H atoms of H2O molecules were localized from the difference Fourier maps and were subsequently refined with Uiso(H) set to 1.2*Ueq of the donor O atom and O-H softly restrained to 0.95 \u00c5.

Graphical Representation and Anion Topologies [16](#B16-crystals-09-00639)] and the anion topology method [ [17](#B17-crystals-09-00639)] were used along with the classification suggested in [ [18](#B18-crystals-09-00639)]. Anion topologies were used to describe the layered complexes having edge-sharing polymerization of uranyl coordination polyhedra. For the rest of the structures, graphical representation was used. Each graph has a special index ccD-U:Se-#, where cc means \"cation-centered\", D indicates dimensionality (1\u2014chains; and 2\u2014sheets), U:Se ratio, # is the registration number of the unit. Each anion topology is indicated by a, so called, ring symbol, p1r1p2r2..., where p is the sum of vertices in a topological cycle, and r is the number of the respective cycles in the reduced section of the layer. 2.5. Complexity Calculations [19](#B19-crystals-09-00639), [20](#B20-crystals-09-00639), [21](#B21-crystals-09-00639), [22](#B22-crystals-09-00639), [23](#B23-crystals-09-00639)], which allows comparison of the structures in terms of their information content, was used. [24](#B24-crystals-09-00639)] and recently successfully implemented in [ [25](#B25-crystals-09-00639), [26](#B26-crystals-09-00639)] allows the factors that influence the symmetry preservation or reduction of uranyl selenite units to be revealed, and it shows which of the multiple blocks plays the most important role in a particular structure formation. 3. Results 3.1. Uranyl Selenite Minerals [1](#B1-crystals-09-00639), [27](#B27-crystals-09-00639)], in nature ( [Table 1](#crystals-09-00639-t001)). These minerals occur in the lower part of the oxidized zone of the copper-cobalt deposit of Musonoi (Katanga, DR Congo). The first mineral was named after the general director of the Union Mini\u00e8re du Haut-Katanga (UMHK), co-founder of the International Jean-Claude Guillemin. Guilleminite crystallizes the orthorhombic Pmn21 space and forms small tabular crystals and canary yellow crusts. It occurs in association with malachite, uranophane-, wulfenite, etc. The second mineral was named in honor of the director of the geological department of the UMHK, Belgian geologist Gaston Demesmaeker. Demesmaekerite crystallizes in the form of lamellar and elongated crystals of bottle-green to dark olive-green color in association with malachite, uranophane-, chalcomenite, and other well as guilleminite. [3](#B3-crystals-09-00639), [29](#B29-crystals-09-00639)], was also found in the Musonoi mine within a few years after, and named to honor Aim\u00e9 Marthoz, former director of the UMHK. Marthozite crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pbn21 space group, in the form of well-faceted green crystals, in association with the other selenites, including guilleminite and demesmaekerite, as well [4](#B4-crystals-09-00639), [30](#B30-crystals-09-00639)], was found at the same deposit in Congo, and named after Jean-Marie Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Derriks, a Belgian geologist and UMHK. Derriksite crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pn21m space [001] or incrustations and fine-crystalline crusts kasolite, malachite, etc. [5](#B5-crystals-09-00639), [31](#B31-crystals-09-00639), Patrick Eugene Haynes. Haynesite is orthorhombic, occurs as amber-yellow tablets, transparent elongated at [001], and as acicular prismatic rosettes up to 3 mm in diameter, and is associated with andersonite, boltwoodite, gypsum, and calcite from Shinkolobwe mine (Katanga, DR is named after the Belgian crystallographer Paul Piret. Piretite is orthorhombic, it crystallizes as lemon-yellow elongated tablets, irregular in outline and up to 3 mm, flattened on (001), or as needle-prismatic crystals up to 5 mm. It occurs in association with a masuyite-like uranyl-lead oxide as crusts on uraninite. It should be noted that crystal structures of haynesite and piretite have still not been determined. [7](#B7-crystals-09-00639)], was found in the Repete mine (Utah, UT, USA) and named in honor of Larisa Nikolaevna Belova, a Russian mineralogist and crystallographer who made a significant contribution to the knowledge on uranium minerals. Larisaite occurs as canary-yellow lamellar crystals up to 1 mm long, and as radial aggregates up to 2 mm across; most crystals are fissured and ribbed. The mineral is a supergene product associated calcite, gypsum, montmorillonite, w\u00f6lsendorfite, and with Selenite Ions [33](#B33-crystals-09-00639)] (and its neptunyl analog has been recently reported [ [34](#B34-crystals-09-00639)] as well). Further, the research undertaken by V. E. Mistryukov and Yu. N. Mikhailov from the Kurnakov Institute of General and Inorganic Chemistry RAS (Russian Federation), and by V.N. Serezhkin and L.B. Serezhkina from the Samara State University (Russian Federation) should be mentioned, who studied uranyl selenites with electroneutral ligands and the first Na-bearing synthetic uranyl selenite compounds. Nearly half of the synthetic compounds described within this review were synthesized and characterized by T.E. Albrecht-Schmitt and co-workers ( [Table 2](#crystals-09-00639-t002)). The significant impact of their works on the development of uranyl selenites' structural chemistry should be especially noted. [Table 2](#crystals-09-00639-t002)), could be divided into two groups: Pure inorganic and organically templated phases. [44](#B44-crystals-09-00639)] and 23 [ [45](#B45-crystals-09-00639)] were obtained during evaporation at room temperature. The first compound was obtained from the reaction of UO2(NO3)2\u00b76H2O with selenic acid (H2SeO4) in aqueous medium for 1 year, which could be explained by the reduction of Se(VI) to Se(IV) in the solution during the experiment. Moreover, as it was recently shown, the hydronium ions usually enter the structure at the very latest crystallization stages, when there are no more other cations in the solution [ [52](#B52-crystals-09-00639), [59](#B59-crystals-09-00639), [60](#B60-crystals-09-00639)]. The Na-bearing compound was obtained in the presence of sodium oxalate, which probably could be regarded as a catalyst of the uranyl selenite crystallization process. Another five compounds, 11 [ [38](#B38-crystals-09-00639)], 21 [ [43](#B43-crystals-09-00639)], 27 [ [33](#B33-crystals-09-00639)], 28 [ [38](#B38-crystals-09-00639)], and 32 [ [47](#B47-crystals-09-00639)], were obtained in the gas-solid or hydrothermal reactions using sealed tubes. In the case of the last three compounds, the temperature reached over 425 \u00b0C. [Table 2](#crystals-09-00639-t002)), three of which (34 [ [49](#B49-crystals-09-00639)], 35 [ [49](#B49-crystals-09-00639)], and 46 [ [58](#B58-crystals-09-00639)]) were obtained during mild hydrothermal experiments (130-150 \u00b0C) when the source of Se was again selenic acid. Here, the temperature and amine molecules or ionic liquids [ [58](#B58-crystals-09-00639)] acted as a reduction agent for H2SeO4, since it is known that the selenic acid is easily reduced to H2Se4+O3 and oxygen upon heating above 160 \u00b0C [ [61](#B61-crystals-09-00639)]. The other two organically templated uranyl selenites (33 [ [48](#B48-crystals-09-00639)] and 36 [ [50](#B50-crystals-09-00639)]) were obtained during evaporation at room temperature from the aqueous solution of UO2(NO3)2\u00b76H2O, SeO2, and respective amine. Since SeO2 transforms to weak selenous acid in water, the low dissociation ability of the latter [ [62](#B62-crystals-09-00639)] and the presence of [NO3] groups in the structures of both compounds explains the long crystallization process of 1 to 2 months. It is likely that dissociation of uranyl nitrate and the presence of amine finally helped to create an environment sufficient for the selenous acid dissociation, and thus to start the crystallization of uranyl selenites. Nitrate groups, in these cases, act as additional oxyanions involved in structure formation with a shortage of [SeO3]2 groups. 3.3. Topological Analysis [Table 1](#crystals-09-00639-t001)and [Table 2](#crystals-09-00639-t002)), and only nine compounds have chain-based crystal structures. However, among those nine compounds, two selenite minerals. [Table 1](#crystals-09-00639-t001)and [Table 2](#crystals-09-00639-t002), [Figure 1](#crystals-09-00639-f001)a-c), which are actually the same but were refined in different space groups, are based on the 1D units of the cc1-1:2-1 topological type (graph is an infinite chain of four-membered vertex-sharing rings). The graph corresponds to the type of chains, which were observed in the kr\u00f6hnkite [ [63](#B63-crystals-09-00639)]. This topology is one of the most common and simplest chain topologies among U(VI)-bearing compounds with the [TOm]n groups (m = 3,4; T = S, Se, P, As). It was observed in the structures of uranyl-sulfate minerals as svornostite, K2Mg[(UO2)(SO4)2]2(H2O)8 [ analogues (T = S, Se) [ [66](#B66-crystals-09-00639)]. Although the topology of chains is the same, their structures are remarkably different, representing two different isomers. In the case of derriksite ( [Figure 1](#crystals-09-00639-f001)c), U6+ atoms present in the tetragonal bipyramidal coordination, where all four equatorial O atoms are shared with the [SeO3]2 groups, and each selenite group in turn has only two O atoms shared with two neighbors' Ur. Uranyl selenite chains in the structure of derriksite are directed along [001] and the equatorial planes of uranyl bipyramids are arranged parallel to the (101). In between the chains, Cu-centered tri-octahedral layers are observed as being arranged parallel to (010), in which each Cu atom has four OH groups shared with the neighbor Cu atoms and two more vertices in the trans-orientation are the third vertices of selenite pyramids, non-shared with U-centered bipyramids. Selenite groups are arranged in such a way that lone electron pairs from one side of the U-Se chain are directed in one way, and from the other side, in the opposite direction (up or down), relative to the equatorial planes of uranyl bipyramids. Thus, the sequence of orientation symbols could be written as (u)(d). The latter has been termed an orientation matrix. In the structures of synthetic [(UO2)(HSeO3)2(H2O)] [ [35](#B35-crystals-09-00639), [36](#B36-crystals-09-00639)] compounds, U6+ atoms are arranged in the center of pentagonal bipyramids, in which four equatorial O atoms are shared with the [HSeO3] groups and the fifth vertex is occupied by the H2O molecule. Hydrogen selenite groups also have two O atoms shared with two neighboring Ur and the third vertex is attributed to the OH group. The linkage of chains into the 3D structure is carried out by the means of H-bonding between the neighbor chains only. The arrangement of lone electron pairs relative to the equatorial planes of uranyl bipyramids is staggered on both sides of the chain, so the orientation matrix for the current geometrical isomer is (ud)(du). [Figure 1](#crystals-09-00639-f001)d,e), which is very similar to the previous type. The graph is a vertex-sharing infinite chain of four-membered rings with additional one-connected selenite group to each Ur. This topology is quite rare and has been observed in the structures of two synthetic uranyl chromates Na4[(UO2)(CrO4)3] [ [52](#B52-crystals-09-00639)]. atoms are arranged in the centers of pentagonal bipyramids, so that four equatorial vertices of which are shared with two-connected selenite groups (as in previous type), and the fifth vertex that was occupied by H2O molecule, now is replaced by another one-connected [SeO3]2 pyramid. Uranyl selenite chains are passing along the (101), and stacked one above the other, forming blocks parallel to (010). These blocks are separated by the sheets of edge-shared Cu- and Pb-centered coordination polyhedra. There are three types Cu2+-centered octahedra in the structure of demesmaekerite, [CuO4(OH)2]8, [CuO3(OH)3]7, and [CuO2(OH)3(H2O)]6, and the single type of ninefold [Pb2+O6(OH)3]13 complexes. Lone electron pairs of one- and two-connected selenite groups from one side of the U-Se chain are oriented in the same direction, while on the other side the direction is the opposite, thus the orientation matrix could be written as (u)(d). [48](#B48-crystals-09-00639)] is based on the uranyl selenite nitrate ( [Figure 1](#crystals-09-00639-f001)f,g). This topology has been in the structures of several uranyl and neptunyl sulfates and selenates, for example, see [ [70](#B70-crystals-09-00639), [71](#B71-crystals-09-00639), [73](#B73-crystals-09-00639)], and represents an infinite chain of edge-shared four-memebered cycles, in which each uranyl polyhedron has three equatorial vertices shared with three selenite groups while the left pair of O atoms is edge-shared with the [NO3] group. Being three-connected to the neighbor Ur, [SeO3]2 pyramids have a lone electron pair oriented either up or down relative to the equatorial planes of uranyl bipyramids in the topological type ( [Figure of edge-sharing uranyl pentagonal bipyramids that are interlinked by the pair edge- and vertex-sharing selenite groups with another one-connected selenite group decorating the fifth non-shared equatorial vertices of U polyhedra from both sides of such a double-wide chain. It should be noted that [SeO3]2 pyramids, which are involved in the linkage of U dimers, have lone electron pairs oriented up from one side of the chain, and down from the other side, thus illustrating the (ud) sequence. This type of chains occurs in the structures of two uranyl minerals: compounds based on the uranyl selenite chains with an edge-sharing motif, similar to the previous one. Chains belong to the cc1-1:2-15 topological type ( [Figure 1](#crystals-09-00639-f001)j,k), of edge-sharing uranyl pentagonal bipyramids, which, in contrary to the aforementioned topology, are interlinked by a pair of only vertex-sharing selenite groups, while edge-sharing selenite pyramids in this case decorate both sides of the chain. Both compounds represent two different geometrical isomers, assuming the orientation of lone electron pairs. Thus, Sr uranyl selenite possesses the same (ud) sequence, as in a previous case, while the Na-bearing compound has a (u) sequence. This type of topology has been observed in several synthetic uranyl chromates, phosphates, and arsenates, [Figure 2](#crystals-09-00639-f002)a,b), the most common among the uranyl selenite compounds and among the layered uranyl compounds, generally. The topology consists of dense four-membered cycles and large hollow eight-membered rings. It is worth noting, that almost all sheets of this topology contain protonated [HSeO3] groups with the H-bonds arranged inside the eight-membered cycles. Although the topology of the sheets remains the same, their real architecture is quite diverse, which occurs due to various blocks involved in the structure formation. Thus, the structures of these compounds are formed via combination of the [UO7]8, [HSeO3], [SeO3]2, and [SeO4]2 coordination polyhedra through common oxygen atoms. Uranyl pentagonal bipyramids share all of five equatorial O atoms with the selenite or selenate groups, while Se-bearing oxyanions act as two- or three-connected units. Such a diversity of building blocks opens up the possibility of a large number of geometric isomers' existence. Within the uranyl selenite compounds of Layers, those, having selenite and hydrogen selenite groups; and those with hydrogen selenite groups and selenate tetrahedra. However, what is the most interesting, is that all three isomers have a similar orientation of lone electron pairs and fourth non-shared vertices (for tetrahedra), which is described by the very simple (ud) matrix. Only except for the compound 36, which has the (ud)(du) matrix. [41](#B41-crystals-09-00639)] is based on the layered complex of cc2-1:2-5 topological type ( [Figure 2](#crystals-09-00639-f002)c,d). This type of topology has been observed in the structures of several synthetic uranyl and neptunyl molybdates as types cc2-1:2-4 and cc2-1:2-5 have nearly identical chemical composition and looks quite similar. Those graphs are built from the similar four- and eight-membered rings, and even have the same connectivity of black and white vertices (U and Se polyhedra, respectively), but the topologies are different due to differences in coordination sequence [ [18](#B18-crystals-09-00639)]. Such chemically identical, but topologically different structural units are called topological or structural isomers. It should be noted that the cc2-1:2-4 topology is much more representative among the inorganic oxysalt compounds than cc2-1:2-5. If the lone electron pair of the selenite pyramid would be equated to the fourth non-shared vertex of the selenate tetrahedron, the current isomer can be described by the (uddu)(dduu) matrix. [55](#B55-crystals-09-00639)] is based on the 2D complexes, possessing unprecedented topology for both the structural chemistry of uranium and the chemistry of inorganic oxysalts in general, of the cc2-1:2-14 type ( [Figure 2](#crystals-09-00639-f002)e,f). U atoms are arranged in the centers of pentagonal bipyramids. Each [SeO4]2 group is three-connected, coordinating whereas protonated selenite groups coordinate one uranyl ion each. The topology is remarkable due to the presence of one-connected branches inside eight-membered cycles, which are actually selenous acid groups. [41](#B41-crystals-09-00639)] is based on the layered complexes of cc2-1:2-19 topological type ( [Figure 3](#crystals-09-00639-f003)a,b), which is a [ [18](#B18-crystals-09-00639)], where each uranyl pentagonal bipyramid has only one edge shared with the selenite group. The graph of the layer consists of eight-membered rings only. The current isomer can be described by the (uudd)(uddu)(dduu)(duud) matrix. [37](#B37-crystals-09-00639)] is the only known uranyl selenite, which crystal structure is based on the layered complexes of cc2-1:2-21 topological type ( [Figure 3](#crystals-09-00639-f003)c,d). The graph of the U-bearing sheet consists of dense 4-membered and large 12-membered rings. Double links between the black and white vertices in a graph indicate sharing of an edge between uranyl coordination polyhedra and the selenite pyramid. Despite the fact that [SeO3]2 groups are two-connected, edge-sharing coordination generates a possibility for an orientational isomerism of the lone electron pair arrangement. Current isomer can be described by the (ud) matrix. It is of interest that interlayer Ba2+ cations are actually arranged within the layer, inside the 12-membered rings. [56](#B56-crystals-09-00639)], got into the review with a large tolerance. There are three nonequivalent positions of Se in the structure, only one of which was occupied by both Se(VI) and Se(IV), and the amount of the latter is very small (~0.07 per formula unit). The current topology of the cc2-2:3-4 type ( [Figure 2](#crystals-09-00639-f002)g,h) is one of the among synthetic uranyl sulfates, chromates, and selenates (>30 structures are known), but it has not been observed for any compound with a higher content of selenite ions than here. [57](#B57-crystals-09-00639)], 44, and 45 [ [56](#B56-crystals-09-00639)], are based upon the layers with U:Se = 3:5 formed as a result of condensation of the [UO2]2+, [UO2(H2O)]2+, [SeVIO4]2, and [HSeIVO3] coordination polyhedra by sharing common oxygen atoms. The corresponding graph of cc2-3:5-3 topology is built by four- and six-membered rings ( [Figure 2](#crystals-09-00639-f002)i,j). This topology of inorganic complexes is typical for uranyl selenite-selenates but has also been observed in some pure uranyl selenates, for instance, Rb4[(UO2)3(SeO4)5(H2O)] [ [79](#B79-crystals-09-00639)]. trigonal three-connected selenate tetrahedra gives rise to geometric isomerism. Thus, the orientation matrices can be written as (ududud)(uddu) for the first and second, and (duuudd)(uddu) for the third compound, respectively. [33](#B33-crystals-09-00639)], has a layered structure ( [Figure 3](#crystals-09-00639-f003)e,f). According to Lussier et al. [ [80](#B80-crystals-09-00639)], the anionic topology of the layer of this compound belongs to the topology consisting of triangles and hexagons. The topology of the layer in this compound is the same as in mineral rutherfordine, [(UO2)(CO3)] [ [81](#B81-crystals-09-00639), [82](#B82-crystals-09-00639)], which is why it is called a rutherfordine anion topology. This topology consists of parallel chains of edge-sharing hexagons divided by dimers of edge-sharing triangles. Each of the hexagons is occupied by Ur, and one triangle per dimer is occupied by the [SeO3]2 group. The other half of the triangles is vacant. Electroneutral sheets are linked together by van der Waals interactions only. It should be noted that recently, an isotypic neptunyl compound has been reported [ [34](#B34-crystals-09-00639)]. [Figure 3](#crystals-09-00639-f003)g,h): The crystal structures of marthozite, guilleminite, and larisaite are based on such layers, while haynesite and piretite (although their structures are still unknown) are supposed to have topologically the same architecture due to the similarity of their unit-cell parameters. Except for minerals, two more Li- and Sr-bearing synthetic uranyl selenites have structures based on the 2D belonging to the phosphuranilite anion topology. The phosphuranilite contains infinite chains: Edge-sharing dimers of pentagons that are further linked by edge-sharing hexagons, and zig-zag chains of edge-sharing triangles and squares [ [80](#B80-crystals-09-00639), [83](#B83-crystals-09-00639)]. The topology can be described by the 61524232 ring symbol with pentagons and hexagons occupied by Ur, triangles are occupied by selenite anions, while squares stay vacant. In the crystal structures of natural and synthetic compounds, additional mono-, divalent cations, and H2O molecules are arranged in between the layers forming covalent and H-bonding systems to build the 3D structure. In the structure of marthozite, there are Cu2+ cations arranged in between the layers and octahedrally coordinated by two O atoms of uranyl ions from the above and underlying layers and four O atoms of H2O molecules from the interlayer space. There are also four 'zeolite'-like H2O molecules arranged in the interlayer space, which are not covalently bonded to cations and held in the structure by H-bonds only. Na+ and K+ sites in the structure of larisaite are characterized by partial occupancies, as well as H2O molecules and hydronium cations, which are statistically distributed over six sites within the interlayer space. Thus, there are also two types of H2O molecules, those which coordinate alkali cations and 'zeolite'-like, as in the structure of marthozite. Na+ and K+ cations in the crystal structure of larisaite alternately occupy neighbor cavities in the interlayer space, while in the structure of guilleminite, those cavities are equivalent and occupied only by Ba2+ cations. It is of interest that according to previous works [ [1](#B1-crystals-09-00639), [27](#B27-crystals-09-00639)], only two sites of H2O molecules coordinating Ba2+ cations have been determined in the structure of guilleminite, leaving rather a large cavity to be vacant. Our single crystal XRD studies at low temperatures allowed us to determine the third site arranged within the void and occupied by the H2O molecule, which suggests a change to the formula of guilleminite to Ba[(UO2)3(SeO3)2O2](H2O)4. Such ambiguity allows reference to the variable character of H2O molecules' amount within these structures, which could depend on the chemical composition and conditions, and the temperature and humidity storage of samples. Another interesting feature is that the structures of natural and synthetic compounds belong to different geometrical isomers. The (ud)(du) isomer was determined in the structures of Li- and Sr-bearing synthetic uranyl selenites, while (ud)(ud) isomer was observed in the crystal structures of all three minerals. It should be noted that implementation of the (ud)(du) isomer results in formation of stepped layers, in which each subsequent chain of edge-sharing uranyl polyhedra is located above the level of the previous chain, whereas the (ud)(ud) isomer results in the formation of zig-zag uranyl selenite layers, in which the chains of edge-sharing uranyl polyhedra are alternately located above or below the mean plane of the layer ( [Figure 4](#crystals-09-00639-f004)). [Figure 3](#crystals-09-00639-f003)i,j), and is quite rare. There are only three compounds known, whose structures are based on the layers of this type. Two of them are Cs-bearing [ [46](#B46-crystals-09-00639)] and organically templated [ [58](#B58-crystals-09-00639)] uranyl selenites, and the third one is a very exotic Cs2[(UO2)4(Co(H2O)2)2(HPO4)(PO4)] uranyl phosphate compound [ [84](#B84-crystals-09-00639)]. Layers are formed by the specific heptamers, and the uranyl hexagonal bipyramid is in the center, sharing each even equatorial edge with three uranyl pentagonal bipyramids, while the odd edges are shared with [SeO3]2 groups. The linkage of these heptamers occurs via the third non-shared vertex of the selenite group and by the two additional selenite groups of each pentagonal bipyramid, which share all three O atoms with three neighbor heptamers. Thus, all pentagons and hexagons in the anion topology are occupied by the uranyl ions, triangles, and by the selenite groups while squares are vacant. It should be noted, that the arrangement of the lone electron pair in the structures of both uranyl selenites is different. In the structure of Cs-bearing uranyl selenite, the orientation of the lone electron pairs around the core of uranyl bipyramids is uneven and can be described by the (uuudduuuuudd) matrix, while that in the structure of organically templated uranyl selenite is uniform (uududuuddudd), but it does not result in any visible differences in the distortion or undulations between the layers. [46](#B46-crystals-09-00639)] phase is based on the layers of a highly remarkable anion topology with the 61564636 ring symbol ( [Figure 3](#crystals-09-00639-f003)k,l), which could be assumed as the modular structure, composed of blocks from both the phosphuranylite and zippeite anion topologies. The latter, for instance, is one of the most common topologies among the natural uranyl sulfates [ [25](#B25-crystals-09-00639)]. The zippeite of the tetrahedra, and the phosphuranylite fragment contains selenite groups. [47](#B47-crystals-09-00639)] is based on the sheets of miscellaneous anion topology of the 815238 type ( [Figure 3](#crystals-09-00639-f003)m,n), consisting of octagons, pentagons, and triangles. The layered complex is built by the dimers of edge-sharing uranyl pentagonal bipyramids, which are arranged similarly as in the structures of such minerals as deliensite, Fe[(UO2)2(SO4)2(OH)2](H2O)7 [ [85](#B85-crystals-09-00639)] or pl\u00e1ilite, Na(UO2)(SO4)(OH)(H2O)2 [ [86](#B86-crystals-09-00639)], but the linkage character is remarkably different. Instead of isolated groups, uranyl dimers are interlinked length- and side-ways through the vertex-sharing groups; besides, lone electron pairs within the [Se2O5]2 oxyanions are co-directed. In those diselenite groups, which are arranged along the extension of the uranyl dimers, lone electron pairs are oriented towards one side relative to the plane of the sheet, and in those groups, arranged side-ways, the direction of the lone electron pair is the opposite. The crystal structure of 32 is anhydrous and free of additional ions, thus electroneutral layered complexes are linked into the 3D structure by the means of electrostatic interactions involving lone electron pairs only. 3.4. Structural and Topological Complexity [Table according to the maximal rod (for chains) or layer symmetry group, was calculated, since these are the basic structural units. Second, the structural complexity (Sl) of the units was analyzed taking into account its real symmetry. The next contribution to information comes from the stacking (LS) of chained and layered complexes (if more than one layer or chain is in the unit cell). The fourth contribution to the total structural complexity is given by the interstitial structure (IS). The last portion of information comes from the interstitial H bonding system (H). It should be noted that the H atoms related to the U-bearing chains and layers were considered as a part of those complexes but not within the contribution of the H-bonding system. Complexity parameters for the whole structures were calculated using ToposPro package [ [87](#B87-crystals-09-00639)]. 4. Discussion [Figure 3](#crystals-09-00639-f003)g), are no exception. Both compounds were obtained from the aqueous medium at temperatures above 220 \u00b0C. In the case of compounds with structures based upon 1D units, the situation is somewhat more complicated. Topological type cc1-1:2-1, which is one of the most common among the U(VI)-bearing oxysalts, was repeatedly observed in the structures of compounds obtained at room temperature. However, synthetic uranyl selenite 9 was grown at slightly higher temperatures of 80 \u00b0C. Moreover, the presence of rather specific uranyl tetragonal bipyramids in the structure of derriksite refers to a family of isotypic uranyl phosphate [ [88](#B88-crystals-09-00639)], molybdate [ [89](#B89-crystals-09-00639)], and tellurite [ [90](#B90-crystals-09-00639)] compounds, which were obtained during hydrothermal (above 180 \u00b0C) or high temperature solid state (above 650 \u00b0C) syntheses. Analogously, the crystal structures of [68](#B68-crystals-09-00639)] and molybdates [ [69](#B69-crystals-09-00639)], which are isotypic to that one of demesmaekerite, were obtained at hydrothermal conditions (above 120 \u00b0C) or solid state reactions (at 300 \u00b0C). Nevertheless, based on laboratory [ [91](#B91-crystals-09-00639), [92](#B92-crystals-09-00639)] and field observations, namely of the mineral association from Z\u00e1les\u00ed (Czech Republic) [ [8](#B8-crystals-09-00639)], it is clear that demesmaekerite and piretite (and several other unnamed or poorly identified U-Se phases) formed as a result of supergene alteration processes, which exclude hydrothermal activity. These observations are supported by the radioanalytical dating of demesmaekerite. [Figure 7](#crystals-09-00639-f007)a). Stacking of chains doubles the complexity contribution of the uranyl selenite block (68.107 bits/cell) into the whole structure, but is still less than the contribution of the Cu-O interstitial block (96.370 bits/cell) and nearly equal to the interstitial H-bonding system pentagonal ones with the additional H2O molecule in the equatorial plane of Ur preserves the topology, but it doubles the size of the reduced segment of a chain and changes its maximal symmetry to the a2/m11 rod group ( [Figure 7](#crystals-09-00639-f007)b). The absence of the interstitial substructure makes the topological complexity parameters be equal to those for the whole structure of 8 and 9. [Figure 7](#crystals-09-00639-f007)c). In this case, the uranyl selenite substructure (117.207 bits/cell) makes the largest contribution to the complexity of the whole structure. The interstitial complex contributes a slightly lower amount of information (85.926 bits/cell), and even less is accounted for in system (60.842 bits/cell; [Figure 5](#crystals-09-00639-f005)and 6). [Figure 8](#crystals-09-00639-f008)). Furthermore, the topological symmetry is preserved in the structures of almost all compounds, except for two of them ( [Table 3](#crystals-09-00639-t003)). All three aforementioned cases point to the fact that the current topological type is unusually resistant and one of the most preferable in the systems with the U:T ratio = 1:2. As for the complexity calculations, certainly, those will primarily depend on the number of orbits (atoms). Thus, the H-free uranyl selenite layer has the lowest amount of information (152.196 bits/cell), next in a row would be the uranyl selenite-hydrogen selenite complex bits/cell). Analogously, complexity parameters for the whole structure majorly depend on the size of the aliphatic part of organic molecules. [Figure 4](#crystals-09-00639-f004)). The (ud)(du) orientation of the lone electron pairs in the structures of synthetic uranyl selenites 28 and 29 resulted in the formation of layers with the c2/m topological symmetry (58.711 bits/cell), whereas the highest symmetry of those in natural compounds is described by the (ud)(ud) matrix and orthorhombic pmmn layer symmetry group (121.421 bits/cell). It should be noted that only Sr-bearing synthetic compound 28 has the real symmetry of the layer equal to the topological one. In the cases of marthozite, guilleminite, larisaite, and Li-bearing synthetic compound, topological symmetry is of each of the components makes the marthozite the interest that the formation of a particular isomer causes the specific arrangement of the layers, and it appears that the (ud)(ud) isomer of the posphuranylite topology, which results in the formation of zig-zag layers, is more stable and most likely thermodynamically preferable among the others, since it has only been observed in the structures of natural layered uranyl selenites. 5.
