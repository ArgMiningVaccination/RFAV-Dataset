Our friendly, accessible community consists of over 3,500 immunologists, giving us a powerful voice to advocate for immunological science and health for the benefit of society. Based in our offices in Holborn, London, our staff of 17 work with our Trustees and members to achieve the organisation's aims. The British Society for Immunology's mission is to promote excellence in immunological research, scholarship and clinical practice in order to improve human and animal health. We accomplish this by: Working with our members to support current and future generations of immunologists Sharing our passion for immunology through meetings, publications and the media Building up an understanding of our work by engaging with the public and those working in the research and health environments Working with partners in pursuit of our mission, building on common interests.About the SocietyBritish Society for Immunology | Annual Review 2018 - 2019 MissionContents About the Society 2 Message from our President and Chief Executive 3 Key achievements for the year 4 Who we are 6 Our community 8 Influence and impact 10 Support throughout your career 12 Partnerships 14 Publishing update 15 Building networks 16 International focus 17 Financial report 18 2Welcome to our annual review for 2018-19. Another year has passed and what a year it's been for the British Society for Immunology. We have excelled in delivering our strategic plan, with the overall aim of promoting excellence in immunological research, scholarship and clinical practice to improve human and animal health. While continuing our core mission to support our members and the discipline of immunology, we have also increased our work in meeting our wider charitable objectives to ensure that all in society benefit from immunology's successes. As President and CEO, we are both new in post this year. Doug Brown started as Chief Executive in September 2018 while Arne Akbar took over as President from Peter Openshaw at the end of 2018. Peter held the post of President for five successful years, during which time he oversaw a series of major transformations, including a growth in membership and scope, putting our ambitious strategic plan in place and increasing our policy work. Our grateful thanks go to Peter for all his dedication and hard work, and also to other committee members who finished their terms of office this year. Our first years in post have been fruitful and inspirational, in particular through our engagement with members and other stakeholders. We both have big ambitions for the Society, the first successes of which are reflected in this report, and we look forward to building on its strong foundations to bring a dynamic approach to increasing the BSI's influence and delivering its mission. Supporting our membership has always been the bedrock of our work and this year was no different, with an array of grants and new initiatives to support our members and recognise their excellence. Although this was not a Congress year, our membership were kept more than busy with a whole raft of highly popular smaller specialist events; these brought our communities together to showcase outstanding research and innovation in immunology, while facilitating the scientific discussions and networking that are invaluable for the continued development of our discipline. On the wider stage, we have been setting the agenda for immunology by significantly increasing our influencing and engagement work. Immunology is a central pillar of the life sciences and medical ecosystem, and as such it's important for us to have a powerful and authoritative voice to represent the discipline to the wider world. We live in changing times and the BSI is determined to be there to put immunology centre- stage, both in terms of advocating in support of our profession and acting as a reliable, trustworthy voice for immunology in media and public debates. For example, our focus on vaccination uptake in the UK has experienced significant success with a high media profile and high-level engagement with Government, parliamentarians and public bodies. Our aim to constantly strive for excellence is also well reflected through our official journals, Immunology and Clinical & Experimental Immunology . Through the hard work of the editors, publishers, BSI members and staff, both journals have recorded their highest ever impact factors of 4.147 and 3.711 respectively. With an increased emphasis on integrating the journals into Society activities as well as building their international reputation, we're in a strong position to ensure they continue to flourish as the publishing sector evolves. Also, key to our efforts, and a topic close to our members' hearts, is our international portfolio. We know it's now more important than ever for us to have a prominent voice on the international stage, speaking up for immunology and the UK research community. Our strong links with the European Federation of Immunological Societies, the International Union of Immunological Societies as well as other national immunological societies and global federations put us in an effective position to improve engagement opportunities for our members as well as feed into the global research agenda. Making connections and building meaningful partnerships to establish the BSI as an integral part of the global immunology community has been an overarching theme for us this year, and will continue to be so moving forward. We can deliver so much more impact for our members and wider society by working together with other organisations. Although at the start of our journey, we've seen notable successes this year (many of which you can read about in this review) that will allow us to provide increased support for and representation for our members while driving forward the discipline of immunology. However, none of our achievements would be possible without the hard work and expertise of our many members and partners who generously volunteer their time to help us achieve our goals. We're thrilled to see the dedication and enthusiasm with which you embrace the opportunities to work with us and be part of our journey to help shape the future of immunology. Thank you all!

John Curnow Groups & Meetings Secretary Donald Davidson Public Engagement Secretary Current BSI President Arne Akbar with our past President Peter Openshaw Membership correct as of June 20197British Society for Immunology | Annual Review 2018- 2019 Our community Our members are at the heart of everything we do. The United Kingdom is a world leader in immunological research, and immunology underpins many aspects of recent advances in our knowledge of human and animal health and disease. As the largest professional immunology society in Europe, we aim to be a friendly, accessible community for immunologists from all disciplines, which supports diversity and works across different sectors and national borders. We work with members from across the spectrum of the discipline, from basic science through to clinical application, and from different sectors, to support current and future generations of immunologists. Our members benefit from discounts to our meetings, free access to our journals, grants, bursaries and much more. In addition, we provide multiple opportunities for members to network and engage with our community through activities such as our Regional and Affinity Groups, training events or public engagement and social media projects. We also know our members recognise the importance of the Society's outreach efforts and being part of our community with a strong voice to represent immunology to the highest levels. \"I think the BSI does a fantastic job in supporting immunologists\" 9 out of 10 members would recommend the BSI to their colleaguesOur members come from 68 countries around the world. 3,569 members 1,664 Full members 257 Concessionary1,061 Postgraduate290 Early career 297 Undergraduates Supporting members' careers through our grants programmeBeing part of our community with a strong voice to represent immunology to the highest levelsAccessing the latest cutting-edge research through the BSI CongressDeveloping professional networks through our Regional & Affinity GroupsTop reasons our members value us 8Regional and Affinity Groups TThe BSI's Regional and Affinity Groups represent much of the core activity of the BSI that continues throughout the year across the country. The scientific discussions and networking that take place at these meetings are invaluable for the continued development of immunology. The strengths of our 17 Regional Groups are to bring together immunologists within a local community, strengthening local research networks. The 12 Affinity Groups have all been created to focus meetings and discussions on specific areas of immunology and they continue to evolve as immunology expands its reach and knowledge. 17 Regional Groups 100+ Seminars11 Affinity Groups 20 Research conferencesKeeping you informed The BSI works hard to ensure good communication channels with our members to keep them informed about our activities and about developments in immunology in the wider world. Our revamped website continues to be extremely popular with almost 1.75 million page views this year and over 850K unique users. This is an increase of 92% and 59% respectively compared with last year's figures. Similarly, our email communications to members and additional subscribers have maintained their supporter base and are a key method for us to engage with members. Our flagship membership magazine Immunology News is published quarterly and continues to be a popular way of engaging with our members. The magazine includes feature articles from leading immunologists, an education and careers section and more information on our activities. This year, we have moved the magazine outside of the membership section on our website, meaning that its content is accessible to a much wider audience. As it contains many articles likely to be of interest to a wide audience range, this has helped to boost exposure of the BSI to the immunology community and beyond. In addition, our social media channels continue to grow at a steady rate, with Twitter and LinkedIn both seeing particularly strong growth rates this year. Social media allows us to engage with a wider audience at a more immediate level, interact with our supporters and spread the word about our work and the wonders of immunology!\"The goal of the BSI Ulster Immunology Group is to advance research, collaboration and career development of immunology researchers in Northern Ireland through the support of the BSI and efforts of our dedicated committee. Through our active seminar series and Annual Research Symposium, we provide a forum for immunology researchers in Northern Ireland to network, share discoveries and techniques and hear from leading researchers from around the world. We have a particular focus on supporting the career development of early career researchers and endeavour to incorporate these activities continually throughout our programme of events.\" Denise Fitzgerald, President, BSI Ulster Facebook: 29,872 for Immunology | Annual Review 2018 - 2019 Influence and impact The UK is a world leader in immunology research and we are now witnessing how decades of investment and research into immunity are yielding breakthroughs in the treatment of critical disease areas. With this success, it becomes more important for us to give a powerful voice to immunological science and health and to advocate on relevant issues for the benefit of society. We've taken significant steps forward over the past year to increase our activity in this area to ensure the policy environment supports the UK's future growth in the field and that the public have access to and can engage with the latest research. Engaging with stakeholders We've increased our policy and public affairs work significantly over the past year to raise our profile and take forward engagements with policymakers to bring about meaningful change for immunology. Our achievements last year include: Produced five debate briefings and been quoted three times in Parliament in debates on vaccines, antimicrobial resistance and tuberculosis. Through our Parliamentary Questions programme, we've had 33 written questions answered, submitted by 10 different MPs from six different political parties. Additionally, we had one oral question asked on antimicrobial resistance and vaccines. Met with three MPs, including Dr Philippa Whitford MP, who chairs the APPG on Vaccinations for All. Contributed two consultation responses on implications of a no deal Brexit for UK science and possibilities for future UK research funding to promote international collaboration. Co-organised two parliamentary events which were attended by a wide range of parliamentarians and sector stakeholders. Taken part in Evidence Week at the Houses of Parliament to promote the good use of evidence in policymaking. Partnering with The University of Manchester, we ran an 'Evidence Pod', where MPs and Lords received briefings on our #BritainBreathing citizen science project. Participated in stakeholder network meetings with the Royal Society of Biology, Association of Medical Research Charities and Royal Society. Case Study Importance of vaccination As a world leader in vaccine research, the UK should ensure this excellence is reflected in the provision of vaccines to our children. With childhood vaccination rates in decline, this is now a major focus of our policy work. Following a meeting with Chris Green MP, Chair of the APPG on Medical Research, he agreed to enter the ballot to hold a debate on vaccination and public health in Westminster Hall, the adjunct to the main Commons chamber. This was successful and we provided Mr Green with a briefing on important issues to raise. He was able to discuss most of these in presenting the case to the Minister, highlighting key additional measures needed to reverse the decline in vaccination coverage. This is an important step forward in our policy work and in raising the profile of immunology and the BSI - debates such as these allow us to get issues on the radar of the relevant Minister, and elicit an official response. Subsequent to this, the Government announced that it was developing a new Vaccine Strategy - this is sure to be a focus of our work in the coming year. It follows on the back of a sustained programme of our work on engaging parliamentarians on the importance of taking action to increase the childhood vaccination rate by providing more accessible services, more information and more training for healthcare workers. Case Study The future of immunology We co-hosted our first ever parliamentary reception on 'The Future of Immunology' with AbbVie, the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society and the BioIndustry Association. We set out our shared recommendations for the actions needed to continue the UK's pioneering role in immunological research. These included supporting research investment, improving patients' experiences, ensuring timely diagnosis and providing patients with access to the latest innovations. The event, hosted by Melanie Onn MP, proved a great success and we were joined by many parliamentarians from across the House as well as sector leaders. By raising the profile of immunology to explain the UK's world-leading contribution to the discipline, we put forward our thoughts on how Government can best support innovation within the sector to meet the ambitions set out in the Industrial Strategy. We were very pleased to work with partners from across the life and medical sciences to give immunology the prominence that it deserves. 10Public engagement Ensuring that the public has access to reliable, evidence- based information on immunology is one of the key aims of the BSI and we've been busy working to achieve this, both through running public engagement initiatives ourselves and through providing support to our members to build their engagement skills. As well as our highly popular online information series about vaccines, we have also run stands at several science festivals to allow the public to find out more about immunology. We're very grateful to our members who volunteer to help us out at these events. Media highlights Through our media work, we aim to promote evidence-based and accurate coverage of immunology in the news and ensure that journalists have access to relevant experts who can provide knowledgeable responses. We do this through providing expert comment to breaking news stories, working with programme researchers to shape TV or radio broadcasts and through providing background briefings. This year, the media's focus on vaccine uptake has kept us particularly busy and we have received high-profile coverage across the board which has allowed us to disseminate evidence-based information on vaccines, how they work and why they're important. Our coverage has included major national news outlets such as BBC, Sky News, The Times and The Guardian . 500+ Articles in the worldwide press48 Articles in the UK national press17 BSI press releases/ response statementsCase Study International Day of Immunology We continued our successful collaboration with the Francis Crick Institute and Nature Research to put on a celebration for the International Day of Immunology. As well as a scientific symposium, we held a public event on cancer immunotherapy. This free event, attended by almost 300 people, saw leading UK and international experts in the field take questions from the audience on a wide range of topics from how immunotherapy works, how we can manage the side-effects from therapies and what new therapies and approaches might be in the pipeline. We all left the event with a clearer understanding of the potential and challenges of cancer immunotherapy and an appreciation of the intricacy of the immune system at work. Young participants at our stand at the Lambeth Country ShowCase Study BSI at the Big Bang Fair \"As a BSI member, I was looking for an opportunity to be more actively involved with the Society. When I heard the BSI was looking for volunteers at the Big Bang Fair in Birmingham, I put my name forward. The theme of the BSI's activities was vaccines and herd immunity - due to my research, this topic is of particular interest to me. \"This was my first time at the Fair and I was not prepared for the vast size of the exhibition area! Expecting young people between 7 and 19 years old and families, we had three activities planned for the day suitable for every age - building plasticine antibodies, a game on antibody specificity and herd immunity tombola! Our activities were well attended and, while kids played at the stand, parents engaged in conversations about vaccines and showed support for our work. Overall, volunteering at the Big Bang Fair for the BSI has been a valuable experience that gave me the opportunity to interact with the public and made me discover their perception of immunology. It was challenging at times to describe complex subjects to all the inquisitive people, but it is highly motivating to know they might have learned something more about immunology.\" Ilaria Chicca, Research Fellow, University of Birmingham and BSI volunteer 11British Society for Immunology | Annual Review 2018 - 2019 Support throughout your career The BSI aims to be a hub of expertise to support our members in forging strong careers in the many sectors in which immunologists are employed. It is essential that our members feel supported at all stages of their careers, from undergraduate through to retirement and beyond. One of our core responsibilities is to offer careers and educational support to current and future generations of immunologists. We do this through ongoing initiatives, such as our grants schemes, our education website BiteSized Immunology and our highly rated mentoring scheme. BiteSized Immunology BiteSized Immunology is our popular online educational resource which provides a comprehensive overview of the immune system, delivered in short self-contained articles that highlight major 'take home' messages. The content is designed for use by bioscience undergraduates, A-level students and anyone with an interest in the subject. This year, we have continued to review current content and commission new articles to ensure we keep up to date with the immunology field. Teaching recognition Supporting higher education immunology teachers is important to ensure that the next generation are inspired to follow a career in immunology. The BSI runs a number of initiatives to support this sector of membership. Our Immunology Teaching Excellence Award recognises outstanding immunology teachers at higher education institutes in the UK. Now in its second year, we were delighted to present the award to Dr Jenna Macciochi, a Teaching Fellow in Immunology at the University of Sussex. The judges felt that Jenna was a dedicated and passionate immunologist who uses innovative techniques to inspire that love of the discipline in others. Her dedication to sharing best practice with her colleagues and tailoring her teaching approach to suit her students' learning styles has undoubtedly paid dividends in providing a major boost to immunology teaching at Sussex. It was clear to the judges that Jenna's teaching skill is valued by students and colleagues alike and has led many students to pursue a career in immunology.This year, we also launched our Immunology Educators portal on our website. Conceived from feedback from members, this consists of profiles from leading immunologists working in UK higher education. The profiles have been put together to be an informative guide on the techniques currently being used in higher education teaching and can be used to gain insight into how immunology is taught. This section also forms a network by which members can find and contact immunology educators working in a particular area. Feedback so far on this has been very positive. Training events Our Winter School gave MSc students the opportunity to hear from leading UK immunology researchers at a three-day event consisting of scientific talks, career discussions and interactive tasks. The fully booked meeting saw 150 students immersed in the wonderful world of immunology with inspiring talks and thoughtful debates. The event proved very popular with 92% of attendees saying the talks were pitched at the right level and over 80% saying they would recommend it to a colleague. We followed this up with our first ever Early Career Training Day, an event aimed at postdocs to help them gain valuable insight into skills that are essential to building a scientific career. Topics covered included grant writing, building your network, publishing your work, and work/life balance and resilience. Forty early career researchers attended the event, with over 80% saying they would recommend it to a colleague. Mentoring scheme The success of our mentoring scheme has continued apace. This key part of our strategic plan aims to support professional development among the immunology community, bringing together senior scientists with early career researchers to assist the next generation of immunologists with career development and progression. The 2018 pilot year of the scheme, with seven mentors and 10 mentees, finished well with positive feedback all round. For 2019, we have widened the eligibility criteria and have 11 mentors and mentees respectively taking part. Initial feedback has been very positive. 80,828 page views per monthEach month, BiteSized Immunology receives an average of 80,828 page views from users in 174 countries Jenna Macciochi Winning team of the Dragon's Den competition at our Winter School 12Grants to support you A significant proportion of our funds are distributed to our members through our grant schemes to support their research, help them attend conferences and assist them in running public engagement activities. Travel Awards 108 members benefitted from our Travel Awards this year, enabling them to attend international conferences to present their work, boost their network and grow their knowledge. \"Thanks to a BSI travel award, I attended a Keystone symposium in Taipei. The meeting, entitled 'Innate immune receptors: roles in immunology and beyond', brought together experts in innate immunology from around the world. I presented my PhD research, which is focused on investigating a role for Z-nucleic acids as a molecular sign of virus infection that can be detected by cells. It was a privilege to present my work during the first session, alongside renowned experts in the field. As well as receiving valuable feedback from my scientific peers, I was also able to hear about the latest advances in the field through the interactive presentation and poster sessions. \"I have returned to the laboratory with an abundance of ideas, newly-made connections in the field and a renewed sense of motivation. I am extremely grateful to the BSI for their support. Attending conferences is a brilliant way to share your research and engage with the wider scientific community.\" Layla Liverpool, PhD student, University of Oxford, BSI Travel Award recipientCase Study Full details of all Society grants can be found at www.immunology.org/grants-and-prizesGRANT \u00a392,000 in grants awarded to BSI members 151 members benefitted from our grants Undergraduate Achievement Awards Through this scheme, we supported 16 departments to promote excellence in the study of immunology at undergraduate level and encourage gifted students to pursue a career in immunology. 9 placements fundedSummer Placement Awards These grants offer medical and postgraduate students funding to undertake a formal immunology placement in a laboratory setting. \"We received a Communicating Immunology Grant to create 'Your Immune System in Virtual Reality', a four-minute virtual reality experience showcasing T cells and their role in the immune system and fighting cancer. The virtual reality experience begins in the lab where Sarah and Georgie describe their research on T cell therapy. We then travel into the body via the bloodstream and watch as the modified T cells attack the cancer tumour. The film, made by Orchard Media, ends by highlighting the variety of different ongoing cancer research funded by Tenovus Cancer Care. \"We showcased this virtual reality experience at Merthyr Tydfil's first science festival, Bitesize Science Fest. It received very positive feedback; it was great to chat to people of all ages about how we can use our immune systems to kill cancer cells. The younger viewers loved the animated 'into the body' part and the chance to meet Sarah and Georgie in person. The adults found the immunotherapy treatment fascinating and had lots of questions about cost, whether it's currently being offered and what the future could hold for this type of cancer treatment.\" Lisa Whittaker, Sarah Galloway and Georgie Mason, Tenovus Cancer Care and Cardiff University BSI Communicating Immunology Grant recipientsCase Study Communicating Immunology Grants We supported 10 projects through this scheme with the aim of stimulating interest, discussion and understanding of immunology among a public audience. Projects ranged from a science-art collaboration showcasing how the immune system interacts with the gut through a 'pillcam' to capture real-life gut images to developing a workshop for A-level students on how the immune system protects us against disease. \u00a9Shutterstock/Meletos Verras 13Partnerships Working in partnership is a key part of the British Society for Immunology's mission. Immunology is central to how our bodies function in health and disease and intersects with many clinical and research disciplines. At the BSI, we firmly believe that immunology is a central pillar of the life sciences and medical ecosystem, and as such, it's critical to our work that we engage with like-minded organisations to take forward our mission and collaborate on areas of common interest and perspective. This philosophy extends to all areas of our work from education and careers to public engagement and publishing. Growing our partnership portfolio will allow us to achieve our strategic goals and bring increased benefits for our members and the discipline as a whole. British Society for Immunology | Annual Review 2018 - 2019 This year we have significantly increased the number of partnerships we've involved with, reaching out both across sectors and internationally. Key partnerships include: Connect Immune Research, working with JDRF, MS Society and Versus Arthritis on autoimmune research National Cancer Research Institute, working to move the cancer immunotherapy field forward UKPIN, developing and publishing joint clinical guidelines on managing non-infectious complications of common variable immunodeficiency disorders Future of Immunology, working with AbbVie, National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society and BioIndustry Association to promote the importance of investment in immunology research and clinical practice to parliamentarians International Day of Immunology, working with Nature Research and the Francis Crick Institute to hold a scientific symposium and public event on cancer immunology Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, engaging with the international community on a cross-disciplinary basis Royal Society of Biology, ensuring that the discipline of biology has a strong voice on the national stage Science Media Centre, providing evidence-based expert response to immunology news stories of national importance Campaign for Science and Engineering, providing a strong voice to Government of the collective views on the science and research sector Association of Medical Research Charities, representing the health and medical research charity sector on a wider stage.Case Study Connect Immune Research Connect Immune Research is a collaboration between several charities that support autoimmune research - JDRF, the MS Society, Versus Arthritis and the British Society for Immunology. Traditionally, autoimmune conditions have been researched and treated in disease-specific silos, but underlying common immunological mechanisms have indicated the benefit of a joined-up research approach. Our partnership is designed to bring about a critical change in the way autoimmune conditions are researched, bringing together the different disease areas to facilitate a joined-up approach to grow funding and research infrastructure and speed up clinical discovery. We co-hosted a parliamentary event to launch our joint report 'Are you #AutoimmuneAware?' and to highlight the need for greater recognition and investment for autoimmune conditions as a distinct research area. Hosted by former Health Minister Philip Dunne MP, the event put autoimmunity centre stage and allowed us and our partners to engage with many MPs and sector leaders to describe the UK's world-leading contribution to autoimmune research. We explained why a joined- up approach to studying the underlying causes of autoimmune disease could allow research to progress faster, reducing costs and speeding up development of treatments for people with autoimmune conditions. Our CEO & President at the launch event Case Study Cancer immunology A central ambition of the BSI is to create the appropriate environment to facilitate interactions between researchers and clinicians to expediate translational research activity. To that end, we have joined forces with the National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) to start a new partnership that aims to bring immunologists and cancer scientists and clinicians closer together to accelerate the progress of immunotherapy in cancer. This will include enhancing training for researchers and clinicians, identifying the challenges currently hindering progress in cancer immunotherapy and the formation of strategic research groups to address key research questions. Establishing these links to speed up discovery in the clinical research space will enable fresh thinking to refine our approaches on how the immune system can be harnessed to target individual cancers. Knowledge sharing will be a key part of the initiative, allowing researchers and clinicians from both communities to keep up to date with the latest data. \u00a9Shutterstock/Juan Gaertner 14Journals The BSI's original ethos still lies at the heart of our Society - to disseminate research with the aim of promoting and advancing immunology to foster future innovation. The BSI is proud to achieve this aim through the publication of our two official journals, Immunology and Clinical & Experimental Immunology. Working with the publisher Wiley, our journals provide a significant proportion of the Society's income. It's been a busy year for journals as we work hard to ensure they maintain their competitive edge in light of the current changes in the publishing industry. 2018 saw us report the highest recorded impact factors for both journals, indicating a positive trajectory. Our activities have included holding face-to-face strategy days with the Associate Editors from each journal to identify key priorities which will shape the journals' development for the next three years. In addition, we saw a change of leadership at Immunology with Danny Altmann stepping down after an impressive 14 years at the helm. His replacement, Simon Milling, takes on a journal in fine fettle and will look to build upon its sustained growth. Clinical & Experimental Immunology continues in the safe hands of Leonie Taams as Editor-in-Chief. Changes to the publishing environment in the form of Plan S have seen our journals team take on a wider collaborative stance within the sector, working with both Wiley and the Society Publishers' Coalition to ensure our voice is heard. While we support the principles of open scholarship and believe open access to research outputs will benefit all our shared communities, we believe the transition to full open scholarship must be managed in a sustainable, inclusive way to ensure the future system is fit for purpose for all stakeholders. 2018-19 virtual issues Joint: Virtual issue from the BSI and the Biochemical Society Joint: Nobel Prize 2018 - cancer immunotherapy collection CEI: World Arthritis Day 2018 2018-19 review series CEI: Translating immunometabolism CEI: Regulatory T cells: exploring mechanisms for future therapies CEI: Vaccines for emerging pathogens: from research to the clinic CEI: Pathogens in autoimmune disease Immunology: Tregs in cancer: where are we now? Partnership with FOCIS FOCIS (Federation of Clinical Immunology Societies) and the BSI formed a partnership to bring greater visibility and reach to both organisations among their respective clinical immunology communities. In celebration of the FOCIS Annual Meeting, Clinical & Experimental Immunology developed a virtual issue containing a selection of free-to-access primary research and review articles relevant to topics at the meeting. These reflected key novel advances made in fields as diverse as cancer immunotherapy, cytokine therapies, immunometabolism and epigenetics, and proved very popular.Clinical & Experimental Immunology The Journal of Translational Immunologywileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/cei Volume 193 Number 2 August 2018ISSN 0009-9104 IFI16 and RIG-I in human third-trimester placentas following HSV-1 infection Antinuclear antibodies in patients with breast cancer IMPACT FACTOR 3.41 EDITOR-IN-CHIEF Leonie Taams ASSOCIATE EDITORS Gruijl, Angelo A.

P. aeruginosa B. library) Immunology at 60 Immunology celebrated its 60th anniversary in December with a series of articles reflecting on the contributions of the journal to the study of immunology over the years. Launched in 1958, the publication remains one of the longest-standing and most respected journals in the immunology field. It continues its long history of publishing cutting-edge immunological research and in-depth review articles to this day. 15Building networks Our Regional and Affinity Groups are a central part of the BSI family, building subject specific and geographical networks to allow immunologists to come together to discuss their discipline, make connections and move the subject forward. One of the key activities that our Groups carry out is to hold conferences as a focal point for these discussions. This year was a particularly successful year for the Group meetings with more events and higher attendance rates than ever before! British Society for Immunology | Annual Review 2018 - 2019 \"Congratulations on organisation and running of the event. This was first class and thoroughly enjoyed. By far the best conference I have attended for several years. Looking forward to the next one!\" Attendee at BSI Inflammation Group conference \"A collection of wonderful talks, immediately relevant to my research topic - very useful for the final few months of my PhD\" Attendee at BSI Immunosenescence Group conference \"It worked really well - the venue, the people, the friendliness. It was a great meeting for building a sense of community\" Attendee at BSI Immunometabolism Group conferenceCase Study BSI Comparative & Veterinary Immunology Group \"Building on the success of our inaugural meeting in November 2018, we organised a second meeting on 'Non-conventional T cells in health and disease' in January 2019. This topic is of great interest to veterinary immunologists because of the wide variations in numbers of these cells in commercially important animal species. \"This was a very stimulating and informative meeting, which brought together experts in large farm animals, chickens, mice and humans, providing an excellent opportunity to compare non-conventional T cells across species. The excellent organisation, stunning setting overlooking Tower Bridge, and good food all contributed to the lively discussion and success of the meeting. Feedback was that 'this was a great little meeting - there should be more like this' with the conference receiving 4.7/5 on submitted21 Events held What our delegates thought... 16International collaborations As immunological research develops, the international networks that underpin our cutting- edge, cross-disciplinary discoveries become increasingly important. The BSI has always been ambitious in terms of our international reach, something we know our members value highly. We understand that it's now more important than ever for us to have a prominent voice on the international stage, speaking up for immunology and the UK research community. We actively engage with our international counterparts on a regular basis through membership of the European Federation of Immunological Societies (EFIS) and the International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS). However, this year has seen us take a particular focus on several areas. European Federation of Immunological Societies A productive meeting in March saw EFIS bring together their member societies to discuss their future strategy to both build stronger links among European immunologists and examine how our societies can work together for the greater good in the public health space. As a result of this, the BSI has agreed to lead a European Vaccine Task Force to examine what actions we can take to increase the childhood vaccination rate across Europe. With 2018 seeing record numbers of measles cases in Europe due to poor vaccine uptake, our aim is to lead the way in engaging with policymakers to bring a cross border approach to this multifaceted issue. Chinese Society for Immunology Following previous successful joint symposiums, this year the BSI further developed our links with the Chinese Society for Immunology (CSI) to include our early career researchers with the aim of opening up increased engagement opportunities, leading to greater understanding, networking and partnerships. We jointly funded three BSI early career members, Calum Bain, Laura Pallett and Ryan Thwaites, to attend the CSI's Annual Congress in Shanghai. This was a multifaceted trip, with our researchers afforded several unique opportunities. As well as attending the conference and presenting their work, they were also given a tour of Key National Laboratory of Medical Immunology, with the opportunity to meet with their Chinese counterparts to gain a greater understanding of the Chinese research environment and culture. European Congress of Immunology The BSI had a strong presence at this year's European Congress of Immunology (ECI) in Amsterdam, which brought together over 3,000 immunologists from around the world. ECI is an excellent opportunity for us to maintain our connections with other European immunology societies to learn more about each other's work and possible areas for collaboration. In addition to funding 26 members to present their work, our staff and Trustees also attended to run our exhibition stand and take part in the scientific programme. As well as running a publishing session where our journals team provided top tips on how to navigate the peer-review process, our then President, Peter Openshaw, presented our work on immunology careers in the Opening Ceremony, with a particular focus on diversity and inclusion. The BSI exhibition stand also proved an attractive draw with a steady stream of visitors from around the world stopping by to find out more about our work. Case Study \"The opportunity to present my own work to a large audience was very important for my career development. The feedback received was invaluable and I have recently begun developing some new ideas based on discussions that occurred.\" Greg Crawford, BSI ECI Travel Grant recipient \"Our aims are two-fold; first, to maintain and enhance connections with the CSI's ever-growing membership to foster future partnerships; and, second, to provide BSI early career researchers the opportunity to build personal scientific networks while broadening research perspectives with respect to Chinese research.\" Doug Brown, BSI CEO American Association of Immunologists Our President, Arne Akbar, attended the 2019 American Association of Immunologists Congress, during which he met with their President and Executive Director to discuss potential partnership opportunities. Discussions are in their infancy but we are exploring some promising opportunities to provide support that will enable exchange of talent and expertise between the UK and US powerhouses of research.Our members meet early career researchers at the Key National Laboratory of Medical Immunology in China 17Financial report Message from the Treasurer The British Society for Immunology delivered a strong financial performance generating a healthy surplus of \u00a30.40m for 2018-19. Although this was not a year in which we held Congress, our total income was slightly higher than last year at \u00a32.18m. Journals and events focus Our journals, Immunology and Clinical & Experimental Immunology , continue to perform well. Publications income reached \u00a31.39m this year, benefitting from increased subscriptions and the devaluation of the pound. They now account for 64% of the BSI's total income. Income was increased in this non-Congress year from our collaboration with the Immunology of Diabetes Society (IDS) to hold the Immunology of Diabetes Society Congress 2018. Both our meetings and advertising income were boosted by our involvement in this event. The programme of events held by the Society's Regional and Affinity Groups brought in \u00a30.11m following the introduction of registration fees; many of these events were also sponsored boosting this income stream. Total expenditure was a fraction above last year at \u00a31.96m, compared with \u00a31.93m in 2017/18. Although there was no Congress, spend on our meetings and events rose significantly indicating the increased activity of our Regional and Affinity Groups, and the IDS Congress. Increased spend on policy, public engagement and communications also reflects the increased focus on these areas. Secure financial position The overall financial position of the BSI continues to be strong, with total reserves of \u00a33.9m at the year end. Securing BSI's future are \u00a33.7m of investments and \u00a31.1m cash.
