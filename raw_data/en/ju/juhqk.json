New products released onthemarket areoften re-issues ofolder styles of devices superficially modified toaccept different commercial yarns or more elegant production technologies. 9G Once thegross anatomic configuration onthebasis ofconventionally accepted perform- ance criteria. Product literature reflects this dilemma. This condition hasprevailed over thelast decade. However the pool ofimplanted patients hasincreased enormously since 1970. Pre- 1970 devices aretherefore more rarely recovered, notonly because most ofthese patients diedbefore thestart ofonerecovery therecovery program was canbeseen inthefollowing Devices reported tobe clinically superior (orequivalent) made bymany manufacturers in awide range ofdifferent configurations andfabric styles, sold and implanted indifferent patients bydifferent surgeons under different conditions. Someofthese patients subsequently returned tothegeneral population pool, butnever reappeared into thehealth care delivery system. Over aperiod oftimewhich varied from afewmonth toadecade, other patients, foronereason oranother, suffered recurring circulatory difficulties. Some died suddently outside ofhealth care facilities and theclinical performance oftheimplanted device orthevalue ofthe where theywere reoperated upon orelse ofunrelated causes. This last group constitutes theprimary pool fromwhich ex- andless surgical candidates. There is,there- fore, anapparent mismatch between thereal device performance andthat perceived through animplant recovery program. Inthepresent case, there areother elements which further affect theresult. Forexample, many patients haddegenerative diseases which brought onthecondition.

Some local cellular activity atthelumen wall becomes visible between twotoeight weeks andmayculminate into a thin layer ofpseudoendothelial cells ontheanastomoses after several months. Finally, thehealing process reaches aplateau with thedevelop- ment ofapatchy covering ofthick, dense endothelium, asconsequence oftrauma- ticdamage. Such patients, however, form anegligible minority of implantation candidates amongst apool ofmuch older individuals with various stages perties toactasadequate blood vessels.

Therefore, further consideration and development ofmechanical heart valve prostheses iscritical. Traditionally, analysis ofimplanted medical devices ingeneral has concentrated onthose devices that failed inservice.

Thepresent study isadditional verification that detailed analysis offunctional prostheses removed from patients after long durations ofimplantation with prostheses dieofcauses other than complications wasdone byDr.H.S, thatalthough pyrolytic carbon isextremely strong andabrasion resistant, under certain conditions thematerial has brittle characteristics which render itsensitive tocracks andnotches, particularly those induced during pre-implantation manipulation.

Character- izing This requires adiscriminating view ofexperience with pacemakers ofthesame model. Recent experience with pulse generators ofthesame manufacturing group orperiod ismost relevant. Aclinician often haspatients under hiscare with pulse generators from anumber ofmanufacturing groups as well asmanufacturers. With current reports criminate bymanufacturing group, onepatient mayrequire close follow-up, possibly replacement ofhis pulse generator.

Retrieval studies cannot give absolute failure rates, since the patient population from which thesample isdrawn isunknown, butTJR failure modes donotmonitor allfailure modalities. Nevertheless, retrieval analysis provides anefficient means of obtaining detailed information ontheinvivo behavior ofimplants, particularly thefailed implants which original participants ofthestudy were sixsurgeons associated with theNorthwestern University Medical School Hospitals.

Loosened interface andloosening etiology Theloosened ofthefailure process, thenature ofthefailed necessarily only approximate, since thecondition invivo could not beaccurately assessed, even atrevision surgery. Interface failure wasclassed asoneofthree: (i)bone- interface isthat all(31/31) loose total hipfemoral components were loose atthecement-component interface. This finding isatodds tothedata fortheother three components which were loose more frequently atthebone-cement inter- face andlessoften atthecement-component interface. Themost frequently observed failed interface might beexpected tobetheone which failed first. Iffailure occurred first inturn ledtocement-component interface failure, asignificant number ofbone-cement be seen. Theimplication observation isthat thehipstems are failing first atthecement-component interface this isthe weak element inthesystem. This implication nothave direct data tosupport it;other processes arepossible. However, itagrees with other studies [8]which show failure ofthis interface leads to high PMMA cement stresses, implying subsequent PMMA cement fracture andbone-cement interface failure. This observation also supports theneed formore research onthis interface regarding failure processes andprosthesis design. Another observation from this data isthat themetal femoral components oftheknee isnotPMMA implies that ifthe PMMA remains tothemetal, there will benocement fracture. with theUHMW polyethylene components, i.e., theacetabular cups andtheknee tibial components. Although there were several cases where thecement-component interface only failed, themore frequent observation inthese cases wasfailure at thebone-cement where both interfaces loosened, orpieces ofcement were sometimes found well adhered tothecomponent ortobone. This implies cement fracture with- outtotal failure ofthecement-component ispossible. Thus, failure ofthebone- cement orcement fracture isthemore likely initial factor intheloosening process inthese cases. There were nocomponents seen inwhich aprimary factor infailure, components will Ongross examination, many oftheacetabular showed evidence ofsmooth, wear metal andplastic, or depth tomeasure. changes acetabular cups with gross 3-body wear bycement particles. This demonstrates that inversion ofthecon- cave surface, byitself, will notprevent particle entrapment and 3-body wear. Another observation, possibly wear related, concerned thecracked cups. Ofthethree cracked cups, onewasDelrin, soonly twoofthe60UHMW polyethylene cups showed noticeable cracks. Also, allthree cupswere loose, suggesting prior loosening asthefactor leading tothecracking; cupswere cupswere those thatwere both loose andhadbeen implanted along time. No cracks were seen intheremaining seven loose cups which were implanted less than 3years. ofthis data isthat some time-dependant process isdegrading thestrength either wear or material property degradation. Even ifoccurring, itwould pose a negligible problem out apotential problem which should beinvestigated. With components, some visible smooth, 2-body wear hasoccurred withMarmor type components (less than 1mmindepth) butnocracks have been apparent bygross examination. There is,very frequently, gross 3-body wear byentrapped PMMA cement particles, but this wasusually associated with component loosening. 4.2.3. Stress Related Failure Aneed forcomponent design andcomparison isacriterion of failure. Stress level butmaterial type andbiological factors such asdisease, etc., arealso possibilities. What factors influence component failure? Since loosening offemoral stems andknee tibial components with hipandknee prostheses, a isthehighest loosening oftheinterfaces orcomponents, astress appealing. forloosening? Todetermine this, correlations between loosening andhigh force variables will besought. These variables arebody weight, patient activity level, trauma andcomponent impingement with edge loading. 5 I9 Forallcomponents, there between loosening andtrauma andbetween loosening and component impingement. With regard totrauma, andtwelve high bone-cement interface tilting stresses post- eriorly, andcould possible lead tocomponent loosening. (ft)There were that extraordinary, high stresses cancause loosening, butnormal functional loads, even fortheheavy oractive patient, will notcause loosening. This data does notconstitute conclusive support, butthehypothesis issupported bythedata available. Another observation that relates stress tofailure isthat fractured orcracked components arenearly always associated with loosening. Since broken components would imply relatively high stresses, this implies that loosening generates high stresses. This isexpected intuitively andhas been predicted from finite-element studies [7,8]. 5.Evaluation oftheNorthwestern University Joint Implant Retrieval hastheinherent problems ofaretro- spective study failure.

Many UHMW polyethylene components loosen at thebone-cement interface andarealso often associated with fracturing ofthePMMA cement. Theremoved poly- thylene components usually have cement still fixed to thecomponent. Inaddition, metal femoral components of knee prostheses seldom loosen andalmost always have no fractured cement. These observations support thehypothesis that stem loosening isfrequently initiated bydebonding at thecement-metal component interface andthat tibial knee component loosening involves PMMA cement fracture interface failure. 7)High loosening. 8)There they comprised nineteen ofthe 61hipcases.

Ontheother hand, for both types ofjoint there were avery fewcases inwhich thecomponent hadnotbeen removed even though there wasconsiderable pain. These results, therefore, suggest that thesurvival criterion gave areason- ablebutconservative estimate ofthechances ofhaving anunsatisfactory result.

Theattendees session. Itistheproceedings ofthejoint session that along with relevant appended material. Theorthopaedic section waschaired byStanley Brown with the assistance Gibbons with theassistance ofFrances Pitlick. Without their thoughts andefforts, these workshop sessions would never have taken place sosuccessfully. Stanley A.Brown, Workshop Chairperson, May, 1980 6G7 Summary ofOrthopaedic Group Proceedings CHAIRPERSON BROWN: Tobegin andbring this toorder joint reporting session ofthetwogroups, Iwould like toannounce that theproceedings from this hour proceedings aspects ofthis particular problem. Being common problems, wedidnotpursue this discussion inthe previous group session. Theorthopaedic group outbydiscussing the kinds ofinformation that programs, canbeused, andthemethods of storing andhandling this information. Itwasfelt that, first of all, there have been several papers presented atthemeeting that provided uswith some starting points interms ofmethods, protocols andforms. Secondly, thefeeling point of Oneofthethings that came outearly in thediscussion wasthat ifwearetohave effective forms forasking these sections forms should beprepared by forimplant analysis were presented during theConference. They were thetotal hipsystem from Northwestern, theprogram from Tulane, theplate study from Dartmouth andtheAO/ASIF, andtheclinical protocol protocols andoneforkneeprostheses with these, when weread someone's publication, wecanallunderstand what they aresaying. ofdata that arespecific tothedifferent types want forourownstudies. Thereason forheading inthis Reference System which isanongoing andfunded system forgenerating national data pools that weshould look to jtheindustrial commercial sector forsome financial assistance in ;these efforts aswell. Concerning thetechnical details that wewere able toaddress inthetwo-hour meeting, there were three papers pre- sented yesterday andthedaybefore specifically concerning the evaluation ofcorrosion atcontact areas between bone plates andbone screws. Starting with this because Ifelt itwassomething wecould actually come toterms with, thesubsequent discussion generated that theconcept thegeneration ofthe photographs, which probably will beultimately turned into drawings sothat they will reproduce better, will give usastarting point. This, Ithink, isonearea where wecanbegin tomove area important one, reference charts orreference codes to take these currently, very subjective, evaluations andtrytomake them objective andquantitative sothat wecanbegin togetmore ofthis three-way effective communication. Finally, there were twelve groups that expressed aninterest in active participation inthedevelopment ofthese forms andmoving further toward standardizing ourevaluation oforthopaedic implants. These were thegroups from Northwestern, Taussig Associates, Johns Hopkins, Hospital forSpecial Surgery, theUniversity ofUtah, Howmedica, Tulane University, Stanford, Zimmer U.S.A., theFDA, Case Western, NBSMaterials Science Center, andmyowngroup. That concludes ourgroup also assome relating isavery thus mayfind outwhythose that Ifnot, next hear from the second group that metthis morning. Cardiovascular Group CO-CHAIRPERSON GIBBONS (Case Western Reserve University): I, together with Dr.Frances Pitlick (NHLBI-DBT) chaired thesession implants. Thereport asummary ofthedeliberations ofthis session which consisted of22 biomedical scientists, andpathologists whowere actively engaged incardiovascular divided into twosub- groups; oneaddressing animals; andgraft subgroups unanimously emphasized that aregis- tryofimplanted grafts together with essential surgical andpatient data wasoneofthemost important and, atthesame time, most areessential wasamply illustrated bythepresentations attheconference just concluded. The approach necessary toacquire such data isbynomeans obvious atthis time. SNOMED (Standard (iii) retrieved rapport andworking isessential 67 could atalarger center, provided that acommon data format isutilized also feature isduetoimplant failure, thepathologist mayhave difficulty recipients during autopsy, less theimplant isinthechest orabdominal cavity. This naturally leads onetotheconclusion that some identifiable \"flag\" must beplaced ontheoutside jacket ofthepatients' records. Italso suggests etaj_. ,under contract totheFDA regarding heart valve retrieval andidentification could serve asan initial basis forthedevelopment ofvalve data collection. Theevalu- ation should besupple- mented bythose used forspecific graft types which have been developed insome ofthemanufacturers laboratories. Representatives ofthis later group indicated their willingness tocontribute their protocols. Stage (iv) Incertain respects theanalysis onein 672 foranalysis ofspecimens. Such asystem would nondestructive testing hadbeen completed oraccommodated. The special needs ofthebiologically oriented investigator whowishes to study enzyme activities orcellular responses were also discussed. Themechanism(s) toachieve theprotocols described inthe previous paragraphs were discussed atlength. Thegraft retrieval subgroup discussed thedesirability of\"regional\" retrieval and analysis Itwasrecognized that implants, thecurrent emphasis ofmany ofthese groups isonmaterials design rather than performance standards. AAMI has beenconcerned primarily with performance standards. Many members of thegroup felt most comfortable with theproposal that avoluntary agency with broad interests (rather than specifically implant oriented), serve asthecoordinator oftheimplant registry effort. Itwasagreed that already Themeeting concluded with therecommendations that aregistry beestablished identifying thepatients receiving implants andthat their clinical course, pathological and engineering analysis valves andgrafts valves andgrafts would becollected andcollated ofthetwosubgroups would like toidentify themselves andadd that tounderstand would like toaddthat there areprotocols ideas fromwhich represents theendofourgroup's report.

Perhaps this would respond CHAIRPERSON question concerns thesubject confidentiality andpatient identification. This discussion should then lead intowhether there areanylegal problems that will arise from forpreserving thehospital information inaconfidential manner. Itwassuggested andlike weare governed different There arelaws, oratleast One istheguarantee ofthepatient. This They cannotdefine Youkeep the record tissue. Inother words, ithastohave gone officially through pathology. Wearethen allowed touse\"discarded\" tissue. And ofushasourownwayofattempting tomaintain confidentiality very interesting astothepositions that different manufacturers take toward this very important issue. 679 Automobile manufacturers, forexample, don't want anybody touch- inganything because typically theplaintiff always hastheevidence first. Whereas, implant manufacturers want to\"hack andhew\" because typically they getitback from thedoctors before theplaintiff or anybody else has it. Basically, thewaytheASTM draft standard reads isthatyoushould make every effort toinform allinterested parties, particularly ifthelitigation isreasonably foreseeable. Butitalso says that circumstances like thegeneration ofinformation or like thesituation where youmight have aperishable item, that youmay proceed with destructive testing ifyoutake adequate steps topreserve thenature ofthedevice asanyother reasonable test that might beperformed. This document, Ithink, will beoutvery shortly. What weight it will have isanother question, since itisentirely voluntary.
