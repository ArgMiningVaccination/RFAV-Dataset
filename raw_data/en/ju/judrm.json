At Concord Veterinary Hospital, we provide all core vaccines, which are recommended for all pets, as well as non-core vaccines, which are recommended based on individual lifestyle, risk factors, and current health status. We will work with you to devise an appropriate vaccination program for your pet. Vaccinations effectively prevent disease by exposing the immune system to a safe and manageable dose of the bacteria or virus. This may sound concerning, but the dose is so low that clinical signs will not be elicited. Rather, the immune system will be prompted to build antibodies against the particular disease, and after exposure, the immune system will be equipped to ward off the ailment when contacted in the environment. We understand that over-vaccination is a concern for many pet owners, which is why we create comprehensive plans for pet vaccines in Farragut, TN. Each plan consists of core vaccines that keep all pets safe and protected, in addition to non-core vaccines that are administered based on your pet's unique healthcare needs. Core vaccines are recommended, if not legally required, for all dogs and cats we see. - Dogs: Rabies, Distemper, Parvovirus, Hepatitis, Leptospirosis - Cats: Rabies, Distemper, Calcivirus, Viral Rhinotracheitis Non-core vaccines are dependent on lifestyle, risk of exposure, and health status. These vaccines are recommended on a case-by-case basis. - Dogs: Bordetella, Canine Influenza - Cats: Feline Leukemia and Feline Immunodeficiency Virus Do not be alarmed if your pet appears more lethargic than normal after receiving vaccinations. This is a natural bodily response, and should subside within 1-2 days with rest. If your pet shows more serious signs, like vomiting, diarrhea, facial swelling, or anaphylaxis, contact us immediately. This is rare, but adverse reactions can occur in some cases.
