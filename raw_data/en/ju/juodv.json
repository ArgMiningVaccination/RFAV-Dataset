The raw material used inboth traditional medicine and modern phytotherapy is the verbe-na herb -Verbenae herba [1-5]. The natural habitats of V. officinalis are widespread throughout the world -in Europe, the Americas, North and Central Africa, Asia, and Australia [6]. This species grows mainly in temperate cli- mate zones. In Europe, it is common in the Mediterranean region [7-11]. This species prefers dry soils that hold moisture well andsunny locations. It is a ruderal species; it grows in fields, on stone rubble, roadsides, and wastelands, often near water reservoirs [12]. V. officinalis is a species with numerous synonymous names. In Latin, they are Verbena sororia D. Don and V. spuria L. Depending on the country, V. officinalis has numerous common names, e.g., vervain, common verbena, official vervain, simpler s joy, turkey grass, wild verbena (France), echtesEisenkraut planta-da-sorte (Portugal and Brazil), cao (China) [13].Authors Pawe Kubica1, Agnieszka Szopa1,J a k u bD o m i n i a k2, Maria Luczkiewicz2,H a l i n aE k i e r t1 Affiliations 1 Chair and Department of Pharmaceutical Botany, Jagiellonian University, Medical College, Krak\u00f3w, Poland 2 Chair and Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Medical University of Gdansk, Gda sk, Poland Key words vervain, Verbena officinalis , Verbenaceae, chemical composition, therapeutic significance, investigation ofbiological activity, biotechnological research received April 20, 2020 accepted after revision July 30, 2020 published online September 16, 2020 Bibliography Planta Stuttgart, Germany Correspondence Dr hab.

Article published online: 2020-09-16Identification of V. officinalis is most often based on morpho- logical features and phytochemical analyses. However, recogni-tion of the species based on morphological characteristics re-quires specialist knowledge, particularly in the case of fragmentedpharmaceutical raw material. Phytochemical analysis is difficultdue to the high variability of the chemical composition of theraw material depending on its origin. Currently, there are modernways to uniquely identify the species using genetic markers [14]. V. officinalis is a perennial herbaceous plant growing from 75 cm to 1 m tall. Erect, branching at the top, woody stems witha quadrangular cross-section are covered with rough hairs. Theupper leaves are sessile, serrated, and arranged opposite eachother, while the middle ones are tripartite, and the lower onesare petiolate and pinnate. During the summer, this species pro-duces small, pale lilac flowers gathered in spiky, loose, top inflo-rescences and some located in leaf axils. A single flower has a small, almost a two-lipped crown with a short, slightly bent tube that widens into a wreath. Inside the cup with four or five sharpserrations, there is an upper pistil with an ovary divided intochambers. There are 2, 4, or 5 stamens attached to the inside ofa chamber. The fruit is an elongated, ribbed schizocarp [6, 15]. Brief Characteristics of the Genus Verbena V. officinalis is the main species belonging to the genus Verbena of the family Verbenaceae (subfamily Verbeneae ) [9, 16, 17]. In the professional literature, there is conflicting informationregarding the number of genera and species belonging to thefamily Verbenaceae. It is estimated that it includes about 30 gen-era, e.g., Aloysia, Citharexylum, Lantana, Lippia, Phyla ,a n d Verbena . The entire Verbenacae family has about 1100 species. These aretrees and shrubs, as well as herbaceous plants [9, 18]. The genus Verbena , according to various sources, comprises from 44 to 250 species. The species of the genus Verbena occur mainly in the Americas. Two species, V. officinalis L. and Verbena supina L., are found on all continents [19, 20]. Other popular species grown asornamental herb although it has long been known as a traditional medicinal raw material. It appearedin official European medicine relatively recently. In 2008, a mono-graph on \"Verbena herb \"appeared in the European Pharmaco- poeia (6th ed.). The raw material, in accordance with the require- ments of the latest (10th) edition of the European Pharmaco- poeia, should be standardized for verbenalin content [min. herba \"also appeared in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, e.g., in the eighth (2005) edition. Inthe British Pharmacopoeia and German Pharmacopoeia, mono-graphs on the V. officinalis herb had already been included earlier [3, 4,16, 23]. V. officinalis has long been a well-known medicinal plant in the United States. A description of it is found, for example,in the Pharmacopoeia of the American Institute of Homeopathy from 1897. What is interesting is that instead of a V. officinalis monograph, the European Pharmacopoeia is a species with a chemical composition different from that of V. officinalis (a typical oil raw material) and a different, limited, distribution of its natural habitats. A. citriodora is a shrub indigenous to South America, which was introduced in-to Europe at the end of the 17th century and has been widely usedin infusions major compounds responsible for blood-cell protec-tion against oxidative stress after administration of L. citriodora in rats [28]. According to the latest systematic studies, A. citriodora , in contrast to V. officinalis , which subfamily Verbe- neae , Lantanae [17]. Phytochemical profile V. officinalis herba has a rich chemical composition ( Table 1 ). The main groups of secondary metabolites determining the bio- logical activity profiles of the raw material are iridoid glycosides (Fig. 1 ), including verbenalin have been identified in verbena herb extracts, in-cluding compounds common in the plant kingdom such askaempferol, luteolin, and apigenin, and specific flavonoids such as scutellarein and pedalitin. Also, 1 ). Preliminary re- search conducted by our team regarded the dynamics of accumu-lation of these metabolite groups during one vegetative cycle. Wehave proved the maximum content of iridoids, phenylpropanoidglycosides, flavonoids, and phenolic acids in the material har-vested at full bloom. The main compounds were verbenalin (max. 1 and2). Phytochemical analyses have that methanolic extracts from V. officinalis stems contain sterols such -sito- mainly, potassi-um, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron, Thieme.

In the available literature, there are very few publications that deal with analyses of the constituents of root extracts [41]. Thin-layer chromatography and high-pressure Our team s unpublished studies have proved the presence of verbascoside, isoverbascoside, verbenalin, loganin, and hasta-toside in mg/100 g DW) [unpublished]. The V. officinalis herb is also characterized by the presence of an essential oil, which consists of about 40 compounds, mainly,monoterpenoids (citral, limonene, cineole, carvone) [42] ( Table 2). V. officinalis essential oil depends on envi- ronmental conditions, V. officinalis chemotype tested, type of plant material, and the essential oil extraction method used. Hy-drodistilled essential oil obtained from fresh plants grown in Italyrevealed substantial am ounts of citral (> mate (> 40%) [30,42 -45]. Steam-distilled essential oil from dried Moroccan spathulenol (> 10%), limo-nene, and eucalyptol (7.5% each) [46]. The volatile fraction of dried V. officinalis harvested in Algeria was dominated by limo- nene [47]. The volatile fraction obtained from the aerialparts of a V. officinalis intact plant collected in Poland was com- posed mainly of hexanoic acid (> 20%), Table 2 ).Therapeutic importance V. officinalis herb extracts have long been used in traditional med- icine, e.g., in European and North American, as well as traditionalChinese medicine. Possible therapeutic applications based on centuries of use of this raw material are confirmed by modern scientific research onthe chemical composition and action of active compounds [38,49]. The V. officinalis herb is used as an antimicrobial, secretolytic, and expectorant raw material. V. officinalis is used in the treat- ment of upper respiratory tract diseases, mainly, in inflammationof the throat and sinuses, and in cases of cold, fever, tightness of the chest, bronchitis, asthma, pertussis, and sinusitis [50, 51]. Ex- tracts from V. officinalis leaves are also known to help in the treat- ment of urinary tract disorders, such as urinary stones and urinarytract infections, and also have a diuretic effect. In women, the rawmaterial is used to treat menstrual disorders, and in nursingmothers, to stimulate lactation [6,29,52]. V. officinalis has been successfully applied in disorders of the nervous system such as de-pression, insomnia, stress, anxiety, chronic fatigue syndrome, ner- vous exhaustion, sexual neurosis, and headache [29]. V. officinalis is also used in the treatment of digestive tract disorders, such asabdominal colic, jaundice, gallbladder inflammation, diarrhea,dysentery, stomachache, and intestinal worms [53 -57]. Extracts from the V. officinalis herb are used to fight fever accompanying colds; they also have supportive properties in the treatment ofmalaria and rheumatism [29,31,58,59]. In skin diseases, the V. officinalis herb is used as a softening, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial agent, among others, in the treatment of difficult healing wounds and in gingivitis [6,29,49,Table 1 Continued Group of Thieme. All rights reserved.Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. 60,61]. Moreover, V. officinalis extracts can be used topically in cases of wounds, bites, oral and throat inflammation, and muscle spasms [62]. Biological Activity of Extracts and Components Responsible, as Confirmed by Scientific Research Antioxidant effect Numerous scientific studies have confirmed the antioxidant effect ofV. officinalis herb extracts, which is important in the prevention of cancer and heart disease [38]. Research on the antioxidant activity of a 50% ethanolic extract and an aqueous extract from the herb conducted at the Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Navarra in Spain confirmed their beneficial effects in removing free radicals. The DPPH (2,2-di-phenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) tests showed high antiradical activity of both extracts 50for the ethanolic was 21.04 one, 0.43 \u00b5g/mL. The so-lutions also had an inhibitory effect on xanthan oxidase, an en-zyme that induces the formation of active oxygen species (IC 50 of 12.77 \u00b1 1.65 \u00b5g/mL and 18.05 were fractionated using column chromatography,and the concentrations of active compounds were determined inthe fractions obtained. The strongest antioxidant activity was shown by the fraction containing mainly verbascoside (which was most likely responsible for the properties studied) and smallamounts of luteolin 7 glucoside, 1,5- and 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic ac- id, and isoverbascoside [38]. Antibacterial effect In 2012, at Forman Christian College in Pakistan, research wasconducted on the antibacterial activity of ethanolic extracts from the stems, leaves, and roots of V. officinalis using 13 bacterial strains that cause serious infections (including four methicillin-re- Fig. 1 Chemical structures of main V. officinalis metabolites. 1245Kubica P 2020.

All the tested extracts showed a clear antibacterial effect on the strains used. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranged from 0.02 to 0.15 mg/mL. Extracts from the stems showed, in general, higher antimicrobial activitythan the leaf and root extracts. The Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 29 213 strain proved to be the most sensitive (lowest inhibitoryconcentration); its MIC for all leaf, stem, and root extracts was0.02 mg/mL. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains and multidrug- resistant S. typhi strains were also sensitive to the tested extracts, with an MIC from 0.2 to 0.8 mg/mL. Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 bacteria proved to be the least sensitive to the action of the ex- tracts, with an MIC of 0.15 mg/mL for all [39]. The antibacterial activity of V. officinalis herb extracts has also been tested at the Medical University of Dalian (China). A dry ex-tract of V. officinalis was dissolved in 96, 60, and 30% ethanol in quantities of 25, 50, and 100 mg/mL. Antibacterial propertieswere compared by determining the zone in which bacterialgrowth was completely inhibited. The tests were carried out on strains of E. coli, Proteus vulgaris ,a n d Bacillus subtilis .T h ep o t e n c y was affected by the solvent concentration -the more diluted al- cohol that was used, the more potent the extract was. Solutionscontaining 100 mg/mL extract in 30% ethanol showed the stron-gest antibacterial activity. The zone of complete growth inhibitionwas 21.12, 16.33, and 15.32 mm, respectively [63]. Antifungal activity In 2008, researchers from the University of Navarra (Spain) pub-lished the results of their experiments on the antifungal proper-ties of extracts from the leaves of V. officinalis . Extracts prepared using chloroform, methanol, and ethyl acetate were tested. In ad-dition, fractions containing the main groups of compounds char-acteristic of verbena and compounds Alternaria Rhizopus stolo-nifer, determined by measuring the size of the colonies, and was expressed as % inhibition (according to the formula: [(control - test sample)/control] \u00d7 100). None of the tested extracts showed significant activity against A. alternata and B. cinerea (% inhibition < 10%). However, a 50% methanolic extract showed antifungal ac-tivity against P. expansum and R. stolonifer (growth inhibition at a level of 32.55 and 28.98%, respectively). The percentage of inhibi-tion was even higher for the fraction containing caffeic acid deriv-atives. For P. expansum , it was 87.45%, and for R. stolonifera ,i tw a s 79.11%. However, it was weaker than the action of the fractioncontaining chlorogenic acid and verbascoside. These studies allow for not only the determination of the antifungal activity of leaf ex- tracts but also enable a more thorough understanding of the rela-tionship between the effect and the concentration of individualactive compounds in the plant [64]. Anti-inflammatory effect In 2016, the research team from the University of Al-Mansura(Egypt) published the results of clinical studies on the use of a de- coction from the V. officinalis herb in the treatment of chronic gin- givitis. In a double-blind trial carried out at five dental centers on260 patients with chronic gingivitis, the effect of a daily mouth-wash with a V. officinalis decoction was analyzed. The patients used 10 mL of solution twice a day, 30 min after brushing theirteeth. The condition of patients gums and the amount of dental plaque were monitored on the 14th and 28th day of using thedecoction and then compared with the condition on the day the experiment began. Observations showed a statistically significant difference in the condition of the oral cavity between the test andcontrol groups. The beneficial effect of the decoction on the gumswas confirmed. An anti-inflammatory effect of the decoction aswell as its antibacterial effect (reduction in plaque) were demon-strated. It is worth emphasizing that the patients did not reportany adverse effects [60]. The anti-inflammatory effect of V. officinalis herb extract has also been confirmed thanks to the collaboration of scientists from Italy (Universit\u00e0 di Bologna, Universit\u00e0 di Parma) and AustriaTable 2 Continued Compounds % Essential oil References germacene D 2020.

The research was aimed at testing and comparing the potency of various types ofherb extracts (methanolic, derived by supercritical carbondioxide, and flavonoid rich). The experiments were carried out onrats. Inflammation of the paw was caused by an injection of carra-geenan in the animal s paw 30 min after oral administration of the herb extracts (in doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg). For comparison,indomethacin was used at a dose of 100 \u00b5g/kg. All of the extracts tested showed significant anti-inflammatory effects. The metha- nolic extract and the flavonoid-rich extract reduced inflammationby 38 and 34%, respectively. The extract obtained using carbondioxide in a supercritical state exhibited the highest activity, re-ducing inflammation by 61%. The differences in the action of indi-vidual extracts result from their different chemical composition.The methanolic extract contained high amounts of verbascoside,verbenalin, and apigenin di- luteolin diglucuronide and apigenin diglucuro-nide, and verbascoside. The extract prepared using CO 2had high- er concentrations of lipophilic constituents such as linolic andlinolenic acids [62]. Anti-inflammatory properties were also investigated by re- searchers at the University of Pamplona (Spain). They studied theeffects of an ointment with the addition of 1 to 3% of dry extract from the leaves of V. officinalis . It was prepared by macerating 50 g of dry herb with 700 mL of 50% methanol. The chlorophyll-freesolution was evaporated in vacuo to obtain a dry extract. Anti-in- flammatory properties were determined by measuring paw vol-ume using a plethysmometer immediately after carrageenan in-j e c t i o na n da f t e r1 ,2 ,3 ,a n d4h .[ 6 5 ] .B o t hr o u t e so fa d m i n i s t r a -tion of V. officinalis extracts, oral [62] and topical [65], showed an anti-inflammatory effect in the rat model. Local analgesic effect Analgesic properties were examined in vivo by analyzing the num- ber of paw licking episodes by rats after rubbing in ointments con-taining 1 -3% verbena extract, 0.3 g ointment base, or an oint- ment containing 30% of methyl salicylate, and injecting 50 \u00b5L ofa 2.5% formalin solution. The rats were observed for 60 min afteradministration of formaldehyde. The analgesic effect was also pronounced. The number of licking episodes was significantly re- duced compared to the control [65]. Anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and sedative effects The use of verbena in traditional medicine to treat nervous systemdisorders had prompted researchers from Riphah InternationalU n i v e r s i t y ,I s l a m a b a d( P a k i s t a n ) ,t os t u d yt h ea n t i c o n v u l s a n t ,anxiolytic, and sedative effects of V. officinalis .A ne x t r a c tf r o m theV. officinalis herb was tested on mice. It was prepared by mac- erating the dried herb with 70% methanol and evaporating thesolvent under reduced pressure. The extract was dissolved in anisotonic sodium chloride solution. Various methods were used totest the effect of the verbena extract on test animals: convulsionsinduced with pentetrazole (PTZ), elevated plus maze test, light-dark box test, open-field test, thiopental-induced sleep test, andacute toxicity test. The experiments confirmed the anticonvul- sant, anxiolytic, and sedative effects of V. officinalis .T h e ya l s odemonstrated a dose-dependent delayed onset time of pentazo- cine-induced myoclonic and tonic-clonic seizures. The duration oftonic-clonic seizures was reduced. In the control group, which wasgiven a solution of sodium chloride alone, the mortality rate was100%. By comparison, in the group which was given a dose of100 mg/kg of the V. officinalis extract, the mortality rate fell to 75%, and at doses from 300 to 500 mg/kg body weight (BW), itdropped to 0% (same as when 1 mg/kg diazepam was adminis- tered). In the open-field test, application of the extract at 50, 100, and 300 mg/kg BW significantly reduced the animals ambu- lations from 121.75 (control group) to 109.5, 106.5, and 74.25,respectively, and rearing frequencies from 52.25 (control group)to 42.5, 39.5, and 24.25, respectively. The tested doses of the ex-tract increased the number of central squares crossings from 6.25(control group) to 11.25, 15.0, and 10.75 (for 50, 100, and300 mg/kg BW of extract, respectively). The extract was also shown to affect the onset time and duration of sleep. In the con- trol group, sleep occurred after 3.53 min, on average, and lasted8.25 min. The applied doses of the V. officinalis extract, 50, 100, and 300 mg/kg, accelerated the onset time (to 2.61, 2.39, and1.6 min, respectively) and extended the duration of sleep (up to14.50, 66.35, and 523.65 min, respectively). The dose of300 mg/kg produced effects comparable to the effects of3 mg/kg BW diazepam (onset of sleep after 1.32 min, average du- ration 571.8 min). The acute toxicity experiments with doses of 3 g/kg BW and 5 g/kg BW did not cause mortality in the test rats,only a decrease in locomotor activity was observed, which provesthe sedative effect of the tested solutions. The presented studiesallow for approximation of the correlation between the activity ofthe plant extract and the activity of its individual active ingre-dients [29]. Research conducted at Tehran University of Medical Sciences (Iran) published in 2017 also confirmed the anticonvulsant effect of the ethanolic extracts from the V. officinalis herb. It was carried out on mice in which convulsions were induced by two methods:using electric current or using PTZ. The reference drug was diaze-pam. The dry extract was obtained by a 72-h extraction of dryV. officinalis herb under a reflux condenser with 95% ethanol. With the first method, it was demonstrated that the dry extract atdoses of 100 and 200 mg/kg BW showed an anticonvulsant effect, and a dose of 400 mg/kg BW was as effective as 1 mg/kg BW diazepam. In the PTZ method, only a dose of 400 mg/kg BW de-layed the onset of convulsions and shortened their duration. Theacute toxicity test showed that the extract at 2 g/kg BW did notcause death, nor any visible adverse effects. Those experimentsalso shed light on the mechanisms of action of the compoundscontained in extracts from the herb. The use of flumazenil and na-loxone reversed the effect of the tested solutions, which may indi- cate that the substances contained in the V. officinalis herb act through both benzodiazepine and opioid receptors [66]. Sleep promoting activity The traditional use of the infusion of V. officinalis in the treatment of insomnia has also been verified by scientific research. In Japan,two collaborating units, Central Research Institute, Mizkan GroupCo., Ltd., Handa, Aichi and Department of Molecular Behavioral Biology, Osaka Bioscience Institute, studied the effects of the 1248Kubica P et Verbena Thieme.

In the study, not only the herb (aerial parts of the plant in the flowering stage) was used to makethe extract, but also the whole plant, including the roots. Hastato-side, verbenalin, and verbascoside were isolated from the ob-tained extract. Both the activity of the extract and the compoundsthemselves were investigated by monitoring the duration of thenon-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep phase, the so-called deep sleep, analyzing the activity of delta waves using EEG EMG. The measured brain wave ranges were 0.5 -30 Hz for EEG, and 20 - 200 Hz for EMG. The extract from V. officinalis and the solutions of extracted compounds were administered to rats directly intothe stomach for 30 min (between 8 : 00 p. m. and 8 : 30 p. m.) at arate of 200 \u00b5L/min. The doses given were 9 g/kg for verbascoside. EEG EMG measurements were carried out 24 h after administration of the extracts. The V. officinalis extract in the applied dose increased NREM sleep time, within 12 successive h of sleep, by 25.7% comparedto the control group. The number of episodes of the NREM phaseincreased from about 138 to 149, and the duration of a single epi- sode increased from 1.2 to 1.4 min. Hastatoside did not significantly affect the duration of the NREM phase at a dose of 0.32 mmol/kg BW, whereas a dose of 0.48 mmol/kg BW increased this time by 25%. The strongest ef-fect was demonstrated when hastatoside was administered at adose of 0.64 mmol/kg (259 mg/kg BW). This dose initially overall duration of the NREM phase by 77% between10:00 p.m. and 11:00 p. m., and then increased it by 20 -320% between 2:00 a. m. and 8:00 a.m. The mean extension of theNREM phase between 3 : 00 a. m. and 8 : 00 a. m. was 81%. Verbenalin had no effect on the duration of the NREM phase at the lowest dose used. After administering 0.64 mmol/kg BW, a27% increase in NREM sleep BW (497 of the NREM phase was shortened be-tween 9:00 p. m. and 11:00 p.m. by 52%, and then there was asignificant extension between 2 : 00 a. m. and 6 : 00 a. m. by 40 - 70%. The average duration of the NREM phase between 4:00 a. m. and 8 : 00 a. m. was 42%. On the next day of the experiment, the duration of the NREM phase returned to normal. Verbascoside did not show any significant effects even at the highest dose used. Hastatoside and verbenalin acted similarly tobenzodiazepines, extending the duration of the NREM phase;however, unlike these drugs, they did not adversely affect the ac-tivity of delta waves in the brains of the rats studied. Adverse ef-fects included agitation and diarrhea for up to 2 h after adminis- tering the solutions. It was shown that hastatoside and verbenalin were compounds that could potentially be used in the treatmentof sleep disorders, but further research is needed [67]. Neuroprotective effect Experiments conducted at the University of Hong Kong (China)have demonstrated the neuroprotective effect of V. officinalis ex- tracts. The studies were conducted in vitro on neurons of the ce- rebral cortex of rats. The in vitro cultured neurons were treatedwith an aqueous extract of the plant followed by various toxins such as -amyloid 25-35(25 \u00b5M for 24 h), tunicamycin (1 \u00b5g/mL for 16 h), dithiothreitol (0.5 and 1.0 mM for 16 h), hydrogen per-oxide (50 \u00b5M for 16 h), and UV radiation (32 kJ/cm 2for 2 h). The cells were then washed with a new medium. Cell lysates were sub-jected to a caspase activity assay. Cytotoxic activity deter-mined on the level of lactate dehydrogenase (LD) in theharvested media. Measurements of the LD level showed that a verbena herb extract at a concentration of 100 \u00b5g/mL reduced the mortality of nerve cells exposed to -amyloid (A )b y9 . 1 % and dithiothreitol by 9.8% (0.5 mM DTT) and 29.6% (1.0 mMDTT). However, the extract did not protect against the effects oftunicamycin, H 2O2, and UV radiation, which may indicate a weak- er effect of the extract against the agents directly damaging DNA. Colorimetric caspase-3-like and caspase-2-like activity assays were used to measure the effect of a verbena extract in doses of 25 to 150 \u00b5g/mL. A induced DEVD and VDVAD cleavage to the toxic effect of A .T h e V. officinalis extract already significantly re- duced A -triggered activity at a dose of 75 mg/mL by 1.4 times compared to control conditions. This activity was dose depen-dent. The results obtained prove that extracts from V. officinalis can potentially be used in the prevention of neurodegenerative dis-eases, with particular emphasis on Alzheimer s disease [40]. Antidepressant effect The antidepressant effect of 50% water-methanol extracts from the leaves of V. officinalis has also been evaluated. Studies con- ducted with the cooperation of two Indian units, Hygia Instituteof Pharmaceutical Education and Research and Integral UniversityLucknow, tested the effects of V. officinalis extracts on the behav- ior of mice. The rodents were divided into four groups: a control, which was given a saline solution, a reference group, which was given imipramine (15 mg/kg BW), and two study groups, whichwere given the extract at 100 and 200 mg/kg BW. The prepara-tions were administered to mice for 7 days. Depressive behaviorswere assessed in three types of tests: tail suspension test (TST),forced swim test (FST), and spontaneous locomotor activity test(SLMA). In the TST test on mice, a reduction in the duration of im-m o b i l i t yw a so b s e r v e db y5 3s( e x t r a c ta t1 0 0m g / k gB W )a n db y 73 s (at 200 mg/kg BW) compared to the control. In the FST test, the reduction in the duration of immobility was 36 and 46 s, re-spectively. In the SMLA test, however, the results were compara-ble among all study groups. The researchers also examined ex-tract toxicity by giving the rodents the extract at 2000 mg/kgBW; this dose did not cause any of the test animals to die. The TST and FST tests showed a dose-dependent, significant reduction in passive posture compared to the control, although lower compared to the reference group. V. officinalis extracts show antidepressant activity in animal models; however, themechanism of the antidepressant effect of V. officinalis extracts is unknown and requires further research [68]. Cardiovascular effects The V. officinalis herb contains large amounts of p otassium, phos- phorus, calcium, and magnesium. At the same time, the sodium content is relatively low, especially when compared to potassium. 1249Kubica P et al. Verbena 2020. Thieme. All rights reserved.

The low Na/K ratio is beneficial when using preparations from V. officinalis in people with cardiovascular disorders [38]. Antiproliferative and anticancer effect At the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Salerno (Italy), research has been conducted on the cytotoxic effects ofV. officinalis essential oil and citral (the main component of the oil), evaluating the apoptotic effect in chronic lymphocytic leuke- mia. The studies were carried out in vitro on cells from patients with untreated lymphocytic leukemia. The number of apoptoticcells that were labelled with the CD19-APC-Cy7 antibody was de-termined by flow cytometry. Analyses were carried out 4, 8, and24 h after adding the oil/citral. The highest percentage of CD19-positive cells was found in samples incubated for 8 h. In the con-trol sample, it was about 7%, after adding the oil, it was 68.2%,and after adding citral, it was 65.9%. The results showed high cy- totoxic activity of both the oil and citral against tumor cells. How- ever, further research is needed to thoroughly explain the mecha-nism of action [42]. The cytotoxic effect of the V. officinalis herb on liver cancer cells has been confirmed by scientific studies conducted at the MedicalUniversity of Henan (China). The experiment was conducted on50 mice injected subcutaneously in a paw with tumor cells ofH22 mice ascite hepatoma cell lines. Twenty-four hours after the procedure, the rodents were divided into five groups: control, three groups that were given a dry extract of V. officinalis at 10, 20, and 40 g/kg BW, and a group that was given cisplatin at a doseof 1 mg/kg BW. Each mouse was weighed and observed in termsof behavior, level of activity, and am ount of food intake. To assess antitumor activity, the tumor inhibition rate (according to tumorand body weight) was measured. Measurements of the degree ofswelling of the paw after immunization with sheep s blood and of the level of hemolysin in mice serum allowed for the assessment of the impact on the rodents immune system. Effects on body weight and spleen index (ratio of spleen weight to body weight)were also assessed. Body weight increased in all experimentalgroups. All the increases were smaller compared with the modelgroup, and the amounts of increase were generally negat ively cor- related with the dosage. Compared to the model group, thespleen indices for the groups treated with 20 and 40 g/kg BW were both increased, but the differences were not significant, which suggested that the tested extract had no significant effecton the spleen index. A relationship was demonstrated betweenthe reduction in tumor mass and the amount of extract adminis-tered. The percentage of the tumor inhibition rate was 15.71,28.20, and 38.78 for low, medium, and high dosages of verbenaextract, respectively. For cisplatin at 1 mg/kg BW, the 42.94%. Analyses of footpad swelling and hemolysin lev- els showed that the extract at the doses used did not cause signif- icant changes in the functioning of the immune system [58]. Researchers from the University of Navarra in Pamplona (Spain) have investigated the antiproliferative effects ofV. officinalis herb extract in the search for new drugs that could be used to treat colorectal cancer. They tested an aqueous ex-tract, a purified extract, and the phenylpropanoid glycosides iso-lated. Antitumor activity was assessed after 24, 48, and 72 h by comparing the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50) with the con-trol and a reference sample in which vinblastine sulfate was used. The antitumor effect was confirmed on two cell lines: DHD/K12/PROb (rat) and HCT-116 (human). From the structural viewpoint,several studies have indicated that the effect of ester-formingphenylpropanoic (e.g., caffeic acid and ferulic acid) and the o-di-hydroxyl aromatic system within the molecule are necessary forantiproliferative activity. However, it seems that the activity ofthose compounds is not associated with the structure of the sugar moiety. Scientists have isolated 12 compounds that meet these requirements: isoverbascoside, A, and 3 ,6,'-diacetyl-O-beta- nyoside A. The strongest action among the isolated compounds,comparable with vinblastine sulfate, was shown by 2 ,4-diace- tyl-O-verbascoside, 3 ,4-diacetyl-O-isoverbascoside, 4 ,6- diacetyl-O-betanyoside A, and 3 ,6,'- diacetyl-O-betanyoside A. A weaker, but also very strong, activity was shown by 6 -acetyl-O- verbascoside, 4 -acetyl-O-verbascoside, and 4 O-acetyl-O-iso- verbascoside. Research has that diacetylphenylpropanoidscan be valuable chemopreventive compounds [69]. V. officinalis essential oil can be a source of natural compounds whose structure can lead to the development of new therapeutic agents. Research has been conducted on verbena essential oil as an apoptotic inductor in leukocytes of healthy and chronic mye-loid leukemic patients. The study evaluated the proapoptotic ac-tivity of essential oil and of its main compound, citral (45.5% ofanalyzed oil), on neutrophil granulocytes collected chronic myeloid leukemic patients. The control sam-ples, after three different incubation times (6, 12, 24 h), did notshow apoptosis, but only necrotic cellular elements. Cytometric analysis of cells treated with V. officinalis essential oil showed apo- ptotic elements (vs. controls), but there was no statistical differ-ence. The vervain essential oil induced significant apoptosis ( vs control) in granulocytes from both groups of donors. The percent-age of apoptotic cells was greater in the blood from chronic mye-loid leukemic patients (76% after 6 h) than in healthy blood (56%after 6 h). Non-treated granulocytes were necrotic in both groups.The exact molecular mechanism of the analyzed essential oil on cell cycle and apoptosis is still unclear. The apoptotic effect that is induced by V. officinalis essential oil could be related to the acti- vation of caspase-3. The research was conducted at the Faculty ofPharmaceutical Sciences, University of Salerno [70]. Acceleration of wound healing Research conducted with the cooperation of scientific units fromItaly (Universities of Bologna and Parma) and Austria (University of Innsbruck) concerned the effect of V. officinalis on wound healing in rats. Gels were tested with the addition of one of three types ofV. officinalis extracts: a methanolic extract (VoME), a flavonoid- rich extract (VoFE), and an extract prepared by carbon dioxide ex-traction (VoCO 2). The rodents under anesthesia had their skin cut with a scalpel over a length of 1.5 cm to the depth of adipose tis-sue. The wound site was smeared with 0.5 mL of gel containing20 mg of extract and covered with an occlusive dressing. The con- dition of the wound was assessed after 24 and 48 h. After 24 h, 1250Kubica P et al. Verbena Thieme. All rights reserved.Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. the length, color, and general aspect of the wound area were ob- served. Cicatrization was evaluated after 48 h by observing themorphology of the tissues (vascular caliber and presence of leuko-cytes). After 24 h, the extent of cicatrization was higher in the ratstreated with the VoCO 2extract. The histological results after 48 h showed the most significant wound reduction in the group treat-ed with VoFE. Also, the VoME extract produced a marked reduc-tion in damage, with the presence of new fibrous tissue, in com- parison with the control group. There was clear evidence that topically applied extracts from the V. officinalis herb significantly increased w ound healing [62]. Gastroprotective properties In parallel with the research on accelerating w ound healing, the cooperating units conducted research on the gastroprotective ef-fect of VoFE and VoCO 2extracts in doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg BW. As a reference test, misoprostol was used in a dose of 100 \u00b5g/kg BW. Thirty minutes after administration of the extractsand misoprostol, 96% ethanol was used as the damaging agent.After the next 2 h, the animals were sacrificed, and their stomachswere examined to establish the lesion index and assess gastric se-cretion (volume and pH). All the extracts showed gastroprotectiveeffects, of which the most prominent was the effect of VoCO 2. The ulcer scores were significantly reduced after administration of the extracts at 100 or 200 mg/kg (1.83 and 1.33 for VoME, 1.38 and 1.00 2, and 1.62 and 1.12 for VoFE, respective- ly) in comparison with the control group (3.50). However, the re-duction was lower than in the misoprostol group. No change inthe volume of gastric juice and the value of gastric pH was ob-served in the rats pretreated with the verbena extracts [62]. Prevention against the spread of dangerous insect-borne diseases Mosquitoes are a vector of transmission of serious infectious dis- eases such as malaria, dengue fever, and filariasis. To prevent thespread of an epidemic, it is important to reduce insect popula-tions. To this end, toxic pesticides, which are not neutral to humanand animal health, are used. In the search for new, safer insecti-cides, scientists from the University of Bab-Ezzouar (Algeria) haveproven that the oil from the leaves of V. officinalis is lethal to water-borne mosquito larvae ( Culex pipiens ). Concentrations from 1 to 500 mg/L of the oil dissolved in water were tested. Mortalitypercentage was calculated after 3, 6, 12, and 24 h of exposure.After 24 h, the concentrations of 100 and 500 mg/L produced a43 and 100% larvicidal effect, respectively. The results of thesetests can be important in the design and synthesis of new, effec-tive insecticides [47]. A summary of the most important results of the above-de- scribed studies together with an indication of the mechanisms of action and responsible metabolites are presented in Table 3 . Safety of Use Verbena is recognized as \"likely safe \"for most people when taken orally in food amounts and \"possibly safe \"when taken orally in small amounts as part of a combination product containing gen- tian root, elderflower, sorrel, and cowslip flower. There is notenough information to know if verbena is safe when used in me- dicinal amounts other than as part of the combination product.The combination product can cause digestive system upset andoccasionally allergic skin rash. Vervain s hould not be drunk with meals by vegetarians and vegans. Mills and Bone [71] state thatphenylpropanoids interfere with non-haem iron absorption andinclude vervain in the list of herbs where this may be of concern.A study in Morocco using an in vitro model of digestion found that non-haem iron absorption was decreased by vervain, although vervain had one-third of the level of polyphenols in tea [72]. Thiswas an in vitro study designed to estimate the effect of drinking tea, vervain, or mint teas on women weaning their babies, and sowould require further confirmation [5]. There is not enough reli-able information about the safety of taking V. officinalis by preg- nant or breast-feeding women. Several sources suggest that thisherb should not be used in pregnancy [2,73], and it has been in- vestigated in China as a possible herb to terminate early preg- nancy [74]. The toxicity of vervain extracts in in vivo animal models was tested under some scientific researches. In the study conductedby Jawaid et al. on the antidepressant effect of V. officinalis leaf ex- tracts, researchers examined extract toxicity. The toxic dose formice was 2 g/kg BW. This dose of vervain extract didn tc a u s e any deaths [68]. The study on anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and sed- ative effects of V. officinalis performed by Khan et al. also showed the toxicity with even higher doses of extract (3 and 5 g/kg BW).Also, these doses didn t cause mortality of the tested rats, as a de- crease in locomotor activity was observed [29]. Plant In Vitro Culture Studies The aim of research in the field of plant biotechnology is to make use of the biochemical and morphotic potential of plant cells. The basic research objects are in vitro cultures conducted on special media, of protoplasts, cells, tissues, organs, and whole plants ortheir fragments. The main research areas are endogenous accu-mulation of secondary metabolites, biotransformation processes,plant micropropagation, and genetic engineering [75,76]. Scientific reports on biotechnological research concerned with V. officinalis are scarce and mainly concern the micro-reproduc- tion of this species. An example is the research by a team from Abant Izzet Baysal University in Turkey, published in 2010, whichdescribes an effective system of plant regeneration from the in-ternodes, leaf blades, and petioles of V. officinalis .E x p l a n t sw e r e obtained from five-week-old seedlings cultured on MSMO(Murashige and Skoog Minimal Organics) medium [77]. Frag-ments of seedlings were placed on the medium with the additionof various types and concentrations of plant growth and develop- regulators (benzyloadenine cycle, regenerated plants were transferred for shoot elongation onto the same mediafor the next 2 weeks. The next stage was a 3-week culture on theMSMO medium supplemented with various concentrations acid (IBA), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid(2,4-D), or naphthyl-1-acetic acid (NAA) in order to induce rootformation. Then, the plants were transplanted into sterilized soil. After 2 weeks, the best regeneration results were obtained with 1251Kubica P et 2020. Thieme. All rights reserved.

In the case of leaf explants, no regeneration of shoots was achieved. The highest number of ex-plants producing new shoots was found on the medium supple-mented with 13.32 \u00b5M BA in combination with 5.71 \u00b5M IAA. Theaddition of 4.92 \u00b5M IBA was the most favorable for root induction [78]. In recent years, our team has been conducting intensive re- search with in vitro cultures of V. officinalis initiated in 2014 ( Fig. 2 ). Cell metabolism in the conditions of in vitro cultures, as our research has shown, is geared towards the production ofverbascoside and, in smaller amounts, isoverbascoside. Phenolicacids are also produced. The biotechnological work is focused onincreasing the accumulation of bioactive compounds in the bio- mass of cultures by optimizing culture conditions [36,79]. As a re- sult of the research with callus agar cultures of V. officinalis , involv-ing extensive optimization of culture medium composition (12 variants of the Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium [77], con-taining BA and IBA), conducted in the presence of light and indarkness, the optimal composition of the culture medium hasbeen established, namely, the MS medium supplemented with 1 mg/L BA and 1 mg/L IBA [36]. This composition of plant growth and development regulators promoted high increases in biomassand the production of bioactive compounds, especially verbasco-side (max. 2454.12 mg/100 g DW). The concentrations of phe-nolic acids were of a different order (max. 46.02 mg/100 g DW - free -bound phenolic acids) [36]. In the in vitro cultures, the concentrations of verbascoside, free phenolic acids, and bound phenolic acids, were, respectively, 3.28, 3.42, and 2.12 times higher than in the green parts of the parent plant.Table 3 Mechanisms of action and the compounds responsible.

Testing of the lighting conditions under which V. officinalis cal- lus cultures were grown was carried out in cooperation with ateam from the Department of Ornamental Plants of the Agricul-tural University of Krak\u00f3w, Poland. In vitro cultures were main- tained on a solid MS medium enriched with 1 mg/L BA and 1 mg/L IBA under LED lights (red, blue, 70/30% red/blue) in darkness and under control white fluorescent lamps. The presence of ver- bascoside, in all extracts. Blue and red/blue lights stimulated the accumulation of verbascoside (max.6716 and 6023 mg/100 g DW after a 4-week cycle) andisoverbascoside (max. 333 and 379 mg/100 g DW also after4 weeks). The maximum amounts of verbascoside and isoverbas- coside were, respectively, 1.8- and 7.0-fold higher than under the control conditions. Phenolic acids accumulated in differentamounts, and the maximum total amounts ranged from 33 to65 mg/100 g DW. LED lights also stimulated their accumulationin comparison with darkness and the control. Additionally, thequantities of photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a, b, and caro-tenoids) were estimated in acetonic extracts using spectropho-tometry. Red/blue light stimulated the biosynthesis of pigments (max. total content 287 \u00b5g/g FW after 4-week growth cycles) [79]. In the next step of our research with V. officinalis in vitro cul- tures, we conducted optimization of the conditions for cultivatingagitated and bioreactor cultures, with a view to nominating themas an alternative source of obtaining phenylpropanoid glycosides.In the agitated cultures (MS with 1 mg/L BA and 1 mg/L IBA,4week growth cycle), the estimated amounts of verbascoside and isoverbascoside were equal to 6857.23 and 374.64 mg/ 100 g DW. Our team, in cooperation with the scientific workersfrom the Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy,Medical University of Gda sk (Poland), performed studies on V. officinalis agitated cultures propagated in semi-industrial bio- reactor systems. Balloon ( Fig. 2c ) and agitated and aerated (Fig. bioreactors were used. Higher verbascoside and iso- verbascoside amounts were found in extracts from the biomass of cultures grown in the agitated and aerated bioreactor (9.18 g/100 g DW respectively). The amounts ob- tained in the extracts from the biomass grown in the balloon bio-reactor were lower, but also high (7.68 and 2.25 g/100 g DW, re-spectively) [unpublished]. As part of the research conducted by our team on V. officinalis , we have also tested the biological potential of biomass from in vitro cultures, as well as extracts from parent plant material. Anti- oxidant assays were performed using capacity) and QUENCHER-CUPRAC (quick,easy, and reproducible treatment) methods, anddemonstrated a higher antioxidant potential of suspension cul-ture extracts in comparison with extracts from the callus or thegreen parts of the parent plant [unpublished]. Research on theantibacterial activity of methanolic extracts from callus agar and suspension cultures of V. officinalis against four strains of gram- positive bacteria ( Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Bacillus cereus, monocytogenes strong antibacterial activity. The highest antibacterial activity was foundfor, in the decreasing order, extracts from the verbena herb, sus- pension cultures, and biomass grown on agar medium. Gram- positive bacteria proved to be more sensitive to the tested ex-tracts than gram-negative bacteria. The strain E. coli ATCC 25922 was the most resistant to the extracts tested [unpublished]. Studies on cytotoxic and antifungal activities were performed on extracts from the herb and the biomass from in vitro cultures, including callus and suspension cultures, and those cultured in theagitated and aerated bioreactor. Cytotoxic activity of extracts from the herb indicated no toxicity against Artemia salina (LC 50 > 1000 \u00b5g/mL), extracts from the biomass from callus cultures showed low toxicity (LC 50= 698.67 \u00b5g/mL), and extracts from sus- pension cultures and from bioreactor grown cultures showedmoderate toxicity (479.34 and 187 \u00b5g/mL, respect ively). Extracts from the herb and biomass grown in the bioreactors showedstrong antiproliferative activity, reducing cell viability by over70% at 500 \u00b5g/mL after 24 h and by 90% at 750 \u00b5g/mL after 72 h. Antifungal activity was determined against Candida albicans Fig. 2 V. officinalis in vitro 2020. Thieme. All rights reserved. This document was downloaded for personal use only.

At the concentrationsused, none of the tested extracts showed antifungal activity [un-published]. The next stage of biotechnological research with in vitro cul- tures of V. officinalis will be initiation and optimization of cultures with a higher degree of organogenesis, i.e., shoot cultures. Afterinitial optimization of culture conditions, the plan is to analyze the biomass for the concentrations of iridoids, phenylpropanoid gly- cosides, and phenolic acids [unpublished]. In addition, analysesof the essential oil content will be performed [unpublished]. A p p l i c a t i o ni nF o o dP r o d u c t i o n In 2010, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) includedV. officinalis in a scientific opinion -\"justifications of health claims related to various food products/food ingredients regarding anti- oxidant activity, protection of cells from premature aging, anti-oxidant content, antioxidant properties, and protection of DNA \". This opinion contains information indicating that V. officinalis can protect cells and tissues against damage caused by oxidativestress, and that it increases the body s physiological resistance [80]. In the food industry, vervain is recommended as a flavoringagent, especially in the production of beverages and alcoholic drinks [81]. A p p l i c a t i o ni nC o s m e t o l o g y Products from V. officinalis are used in cosmetology mainly due to the presence of essential oil with a characteristic scent. The fol-lowing raw materials for use in the production of cosmetics arelisted in the Cosmetic Ingredient Database (CosIng) [82] main- tained by the European Commission: extract from the green parts and extract from the green parts and flowers -approved for use as emollients and as skin conditioners; extract from the flowersand floral water -for use in skin conditioning; water from the flowers and leaves -for use as a flavoring agent and for condition- ing the skin; and oil and absolute (i.e., oil containing only volatilefragrances) from the leaves -approved as a component of per- fumes. There are many different cosmetics available on the global cos- metics market containing products from V. officinalis , including soaps, hair shampoos, body lotions, massage oils, and bodyscrubs. Conclusions The use of the V. officinalis herb in modern phytotherapy is grounded in its use in folk medicine of different countries and in traditional Chinese medicine. Professional research on the biolog-ical activity of extracts from this raw material conducted in recentyears confirms its long-known use in traditional phytotherapy.However, the latest studies of the raw material report on its otherpotentially valuable applications, such as antioxidant, antimicro-bial, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective anticancer, out in scientific cen- ters around the world, for example, in Germany, Austria, Spain,Turkey, Egypt, Ethiopia, Pakistan, India, Japan, China, and Poland. The interest in V. officinalis results not only from the fact that this species is present on all continents, but mainly because of its me-dicinal values. The proven, very rich and diverse chemical compo-sition of the raw material (iridoids, phenylpropanoid glycosides,flavonoids, terpenoids, phenolic acids, the presence of essentialoil) determines its valuable therapeutic properties. Nowadays, of-ficially, the V. officinalis herb is recommended in the treatment of respiratory tract disorders, such as colds, fever, tightness of the chest, bronchitis, asthma, pertu ssis, and sinusitis, nervous system disorders, such as stress, anxiety, depression, chronic fatigue syn-drome, nervous exhaustion, and insomnia, sexual neurosis, andheadache, digestive tract disorders such as abdominal colic, jaun-dice, gallbladder inflammation, and intestinal worms, and urinarytract disorders such as urinary stones, urinary tract infections, andreproductive system diseases, e.g. dysmenorrhea. Moreover, V. officinalis extracts could be used topically in cases of wounds, bites, oral and throat inflammation, muscle spasms, and rheu-matic conditions. The largest part of scientific research focused on V. officinalis is related to the phytochemical analyses. The chemical compositionof extracts from various parts of the plant, and also the essentialoil, have been widely analyzed [30, 35, using supercritical carbon dioxide [62] have been studied. Thesestudies have proved differences in the chemical composition de-pend on origin and the part of the studied plants, as well as ap-plied extraction methods and use of solvents of different polar-ities. Many authors have analyzed the important pharmacological properties of plant extracts (herb, leaf, root), Table 3). However, studies do not strictly indicate which component is responsible for a given activity. Further research should be fo-cused on association of the mechanism of biological activitieswith specific compounds. The biological activities of V. officinalis have been studied in vi- troon cell lines. These studies deals with the neuroprotective ef- fect on rat cortical neurons culture in- duction of neoplastic cells in leukocytes isolated from human blood [70], proapoptotic activity on lymphocytes from patientswith untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia [42], and antiprolif-erative activity on the rat colonic epithelial cell line DHD/K12/PROb and human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HCT-116 [69]( Table 3 ). All mentioned studies concern mechanisms impor- tant in the treatment of civilization diseases (Alzheimer s disease and cancer treatment) but they are still a long way from in vitro experiments to use in human treatment. There are also studies performed in vivo on mouse or rat mod- els. Based on them, activities such antidepressant [68] were proven( Table 3 ). From scientific literature reviews performed by us, we found only one publication regarding trials of vervain extracts 1254Kubica P et Thieme.

It was a wide multicenter clinical trial on patients with chronic generalized gingivitis [60]. The modern applications of V. officinalis are connected with its long-term traditional use. However, the effectiveness, potencyand dosages of plant material and extracts require further evalua-tion. Moreover, some applications known from folk medicine stilldemand scientific confirmation, e.g., antispasmodic, diuretic andantipyretic activity, as well as applications on the respiratory sys- tem like expectorant and secretolytic, and of the digestive system disorders (e.g., diarrhea, dysentery, stomachache and intestinalworms). In the view of performed review on V. officinalis, its chemical composition also determines an important position of this speciesin the food and cosmetics industries. High hopes can also be placed in the research with in vitro cul- tures of V. officinalis . In the future, they may, after further optimi- zation, be an alternative source for obtaining biologically active compounds valuable in medicine and in the production of foodand cosmetics.
