The right to live independently in a place of one's own choosing is a core value of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (United Nations, 2006). Residential services should be aware of the unique social and developmental needs of adults living in their care, and their different requirements as they grow, develop and mature form childhood into adulthood (HIQA, 2013). Those with a disability have the right to: Nutritional support from providers who respect their needs To be actively involved in determining the services they receive and are empowered to exercise their rights including the right to food choices, enjoyment of meals, food patterns and food preferences A nutritious and adequate diet based on scientific health and nutrition research (guidelines and recommendations provided in this policy) A culturally-acceptable diet that promotes the individual's health and meets individual needs Safely-prepared and stored food served in a pleasant atmosphere A varied diet of fresh, whole, and minimally-processed foods Choices of foods to include or exclude from the individual's diet On-going information, provided in a way people understand, about individual dietary needs and appropriate foods to meet those needs, communicated in a way easily understood Representation in population-based food and nutrition research studies, to ensure findings generalise to, and are useful for, people with disabilities Fair and respectful treatment from those health care professionals involved in the provision of food and nutrition. (Adapted from Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, 2008). SECTION 1.0 Introduction Toolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 20208 9 This Toolkit provides practical resources and guidance for all care staff tasked with the implementation of the Nutrition and Hydration policy. For each section in Part A of the policy there is an equivalent section in this toolkit with resources to help implement the recommendations in each section of the policy. Most of the resources in this toolkit have been developed by heath care professionals working in Irish residential settings, and I am deeply grateful for all the help and support of these colleagues, especially the members of the technical working group (listed in Part B of the main policy).

Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool ('MUST') The 'MUST' screening tool is the most commonly used screening tool in Ireland. It is validated for use in hospital and community settings. It is a 5-Step screening tool to identify adults who are malnourished, at risk of malnutrition (undernutrition) or obese.SECTION 2.0 Nutritional Care for Adults Accessing Disability Services'MUST' is a five-step screening tool to identify adults, who are malnourished, at risk of malnutrition (undernutrition), or obese. It also includes management guidelines which can be used to develop a care plan. It is for use in hospitals, community and other care settings and can be used by all care workers. This guide contains: A flow chart showing the 5 steps to use for screening and management BMI chart Weight loss tables Alternative measurements when BMI cannot be obtained by measuring weight and height. Please refer to The 'MUST' Explanatory Booklet for more information when weight and height cannot be measured, and when screening patient groups in which extra care in interpretation is needed (e.g. those with fluid disturbances, plaster casts, amputations, critical illness and pregnant or lactating women). The booklet can also be used for training. See The 'MUST' Report for supporting evidence. Please note that 'MUST' has not been designed to detect deficiencies or excessive intakes of vitamins and minerals and is of use only in adults.The 5 'MUST' Steps Step 1 Measure height and weight to get a BMI score using chart provided. If unable to obtain height and weight, use the alternative procedures shown in this guide. Step 2 Note percentage unplanned weight loss and score using tables provided. Step 3 Establish acute disease effect and score. Step 4 Add scores from steps 1, 2 and 3 together to obtain overall risk of malnutrition. Step 5 Use management guidelines and/or local policy to develop care plan.Malnutrition Advisory Group A Standing Committee of BAPENMAG MUST'Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool' Alternative measurements: instructions registered charity 1023927 www.bapen.org.uk \u00a9 BAPENToolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 202012 13 The following Management Guidelines (Step 5 of 'MUST') relevant to the Intellectual Disability setting have been developed by the Community Nutrition and Dietetic Service in HSE Dublin Mid-Leinster (Midlands Area) (2015).

Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) The Canadian Malnutrition Task Force, under the leadership of Dr. Jeejeebhoy, revised the SGA form to better reflect the effect dietary intake has on body composition. As well, the form includes detail around the importance of understanding the difference poor appetite and cachexia have on body composition. Available to download from: http://nutritioncareincanada.ca/sites/default/uploads/files/ SGA%20Tool%20EN%20colour_2017(1).pdf iv. Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) This validated screening tool was designed for patients and residents aged 65 years and over. It was developed by Professor Bruno Velas in association with the Nestle Nutrition Institute. Further information about the MNA, along with a downloadable MNA form is available at: https://www.mna-elderly.com/Toolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 202018 2.2 Nutrition Assessments Tools i. Eating, Drinking and Nutrition Needs Assessment Identification of Food, Nutrition and Hydration Needs 1. Screen all residents for risk of malnutrition using a validated screening tool 2. Measure weight and height and calculate BMI* 3. Ask if existing requirements: - for a therapeutic or textured modified diet - for cultural, ethnic or religious dietary requirements - for nutrition support (oral nutritional supplements, enteral tube feeding, parenteral nutrition) 4. Check for presence of medically diagnosed food allergies or intolerances 5. Ask resident or carer/family member to rate their appetite, for example, good, fair, poor 6.Observe for physical difficulties with eating and drinking including: - Swallowing difficulties (please refer to the signs and symptoms of dysphagia in Section 6.0 of this tooklit) - Requirement for adaptive cutlery Send referrals to Speech and Language Therapy and/or Occupational Therapy (as appropriate) 7. Assess level of assistance required at mealtimes - Not applicable - Partial assistance - Total assistance 8. Check oral health status 9.Check food and fluid preferences 10. Check if existing behaviour issues or distress around food or at mealtimes 11. Consider conditions that require referral to the dietitian (see Appendix 1 in main policy) *Weight, height and BMI is included in some nutrition screening tools for example the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool ('MUST').

A review of a patient's clinical state and biochemistry will indicate whether or not a patient is metabolically stressed and to what degree. The stress response is characterised by at least one of the following: Elevated temperature Raised white cell count Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) Raised blood urea Low serum albumin levels For general stress factors use the Elia nomogram as a guide. Elia nomogramToolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 202024 ii. Mifflin-St. Jeor Equation Men: BMR = (9.99 X weight in kg) + (6.25 X height in cm) - (4.92 X age) + 5 Women: BMR = (9.99 X weight in kg) + (6.25 X height in cm) - (4.92 X age) - 161 The determine Total Energy Expenditure (TEE), the BMR is multiplied by the appropriate activity factor, as follows: Sedentary (little or no exercise) BMR X 1.200 Lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-2 days per X 1.725 Extra active (very hard exercise/sports and physical job) BMR X 1.900 iii. Obesity and Energy Requirements In a person who is greater than 120% of Ideal Body Weight (IBW), estimated energy requirements can be determined using an adjusted body weight. Females: [(Actual Body Weight (ABW) in kg - Ideal Body Weight (IBW) in kg) * 2.5 ]/ IBW Males: [ABW in kg - IBW in kg) 3.8] / IBW Simple caloric equation for Obesity (Horie, 2008) Estimated Energy Expenditure = 17-21 kcals/kg ABWToolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 202024 25 2.4 Hydration Management i. Signs and Symptoms of Dehydration Good levels of hydration can help prevent or aid in the treatment of pressure ulcers, low blood pressure, urinary infections, constipation, confusion, falls. Aim for an intake of 1,500 mls fluid daily minimum (approx. 8 cups/glasses). Increased Thirst Dry Mouth and Lip Tired or Sleepy Decreased urine outputDark Coloured urine or strong smelling urine Headache Dry and loose skin DizzinessDEHYDRATION CHECKLIST Urine Colour ChartToolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 202026 ii. General Hydration Management 1. Provide fluids consistently throughout the day. 2. Ensure each person receives a daily intake of a minimum of 1,500 mls of free fluids in 24 hrs (approx. 8 cups/glasses). 3. Those that are small of stature may require less fluid, requirements should be assessed on an individual basis, refer to dietitian if unsure of exact requirements. 4. Have a jug of fresh water and glasses available for visitors and staff to offer to the residents throughout the day. 5. Ensure that all fluids are thickened to correct consistency if resident has been prescribed thickened fluids by an SLT. 6. Schedule additional fluid rounds other than meal times. 7. Offer a drink at the end of each meal to cleanse and refresh the mouth. 8. Offer a variety of fluids - water, milk, unsweetened juice, tea, coffee, soup, homemade fruit smoothies etc. Water should be first preference. 9. Monitor for fluid loss during hot weather. iii. Hydration Management during Illness 10. Record food and fluid intake on Food & Fluid Record Sheet. (sample available in this section). 11. Offer 30 - 60 mls fluid per hour when awake and alert. 12. In order to maximise intake, ensure fluids are provided consistently throughout the day and when awake at night. 13. Offer a variety of fluids but water should be first preference. 14. Offer hydrating foods for main meals/snacks - cereal with milk, soup, jelly and ice- cream, yogurt drinks etc. 15. Offer a drink with every 2 - 3 mouthfuls of food in order to maximise intake. 16. Monitor for fluid loss related to vomiting/diarrhoea/fever. 17. Consider subcutaneous fluids if appropriate.Toolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 202026 27 2.5 Anthropometry i. Importance of Weight Checks Increased weight Could be caused by: Over Eating Fluid Retention Medications Low Mood Underlying Medical ConditionDecreased Weight Could be caused by: Not eating enough (Malnutrition) Dental problems Increase in tremors / shakes Vomiting / Diarrhoea (malabsorption) Medications Low Mood Underlying Medical Condition Always recheck weight if there is a significant change from last month Reproduced with kind permission from Teresa Stenson, Senior Dietitian, Nutrition and Dietetics Department St. Mary's Hospital, Phoenix Park, Dublin 20.Toolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 202028 ii. Weighing Guidelines 1. Weight checks should be carried out monthly on roughly the same time each month and preferably at the same time of the day. 2. Weights should be recorded on reliable and calibrated scales, and the same scales should be used each time. 3. Weights should be recorded in kg (see weight conversion chart in this section. 4. If in doubt about accuracy of weight i.e. unrealistic increase or decrease in 1 month, always re-check weight. 5. Unintended weight change of 10% of body weight within 3-6 months (NICE, 2006) should be referred to a Dietitian. Clothing 6. Individuals should be weighed in light clothing and shoes should be removed. Bladder 7. Bladder should be emptied prior to weight check. 8. If an individual has a urinary catheter in situ, then the catheter bag should be emptied. 9. If the individual wears a pad, the pad should be dry. Bowels 10. Persons should be weighed preferably when bowel is empty. 11. Note: If an individual is constipated this may add 1-2 kg weight. Mobility 12. If individual is able to mobilise independently, a stand-on scales may be used. 13. If individual is unable to stand independently, sit on scales should be used. Wheelchair 14. If an individual is weighed in their wheelchair ensure an accurate weight of the chair each time, as adjustments to wheelchair can make a significant difference to the weight of the chair e.g. addition/removal of head-rest, food-plates etc. 15. Rucksacks / catheter bags / enteral feeds /power packs / trays should be removed from the wheelchair before weighing an individual.

Measuring Height Where possible, a height measure should be used in order to obtain the most accurate measurement. If a height measure is not available, choose a wall that is clear of hanging objects, and which has a flat floor surface beneath. Resident should be barefoot or in thin socks and wearing light clothing so the positioning of the body can be seen. The resident should stand with their back to the wall , with weight distributed evenly on both feet, heels together and the back of the heels should touch the wall if possible. The head should be positioned so that the resident can look straight ahead, with line of vision perpendicular to the body, known as the 'Frankfort Plane'. The arms should hang freely by the sides with the head, back and heels in contact with the wall. The resident is asked to inhale deeply and maintain a fully erect position, while maintaining the head in the Frankfort position. A pencil mark should be placed on the wall at the exact top point of the head, OR if using a height measure the moveable head board brought onto the topmost point on the head with sufficient pressure to compress the hair. The height is recorded in metres and centimtres, to the nearest 0.1cm either using a measuring tape or reading from the height measure. For residents who are unable to stand upright, but can maintain a flat lying position, use a measuring tape as follows: Individual should be lying down on their back on their bed or on a soft mat on the floor. Measure the length of the body in small sections. Add these together to provide a total length. If the person has marked scoliosis, measure both sides and take the average. (NHS Tayside Nutrition) If height cannot be measured, use a reported or recently documented height.Toolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 202032 33 Feet Inch Metre 4 ft. 0 1.21 4 ft. 1 1.24 4 ft. 2 1.27 4 ft. 3 1.29 4 ft. 4 1.32 4 ft. 5 1.34 4 ft. 6 1.37 4 ft. 7 1.39 4 ft. 8 1.42 4 ft. 9 1.44 4 ft. 10 1.47 4 ft. 11 1.49vii.

Alternative Height Measurements Ulna Length Ask the resident to bend an arm (left side if possible), palm across chest, fingers pointing to opposite shoulder Using a tape measure, measure in centimtres (cm) to the nearest 0.5 cm between the elbow (olecranon) and the mid-point of the prominent bone of the wrist (styloid process) Use Table 3 below to convert ulna length (cm) to height (m) Table 3: Estimating Height from Ulna LengthAlternative measurements and considerations Alternative measurements: instructions and tables If height cannot be obtained, use length of forearm (ulna) to calculate height using tables below. (See The 'MUST' Explanatory Booklet for details of other alternative measurements (knee height and demispan) that can also be used to estimate height). Estimating height from ulna length Measure between the point of the elbow (olecranon process) and the midpoint of the prominent bone of the wrist (styloid process) (left side if possible). Estimating BMI category from mid upper arm circumference (MUAC) The subject's left arm should be bent at the elbow at a 90 degree angle, with the upper arm held parallel to the side of the body. Measure the distance between the bony protrusion on the shoulder (acromion) and the point of the elbow (olecranon process). Mark the mid-point. Ask the subject to let arm hang loose and measure around the upper arm at the mid-point, making sure that the tape measure is snug but not tight. If MUAC is <23.5 cm, BMI is likely to be <20 kg/m2. If MUAC is >32.0 cm, BMI is likely to be >30 kg/m2. The use of MUAC provides a general indication of BMI and is not designed to generate an actual score for use with 'MUST'.

BMI may not be appropriate for those that are small in stature xi. Estimating BMI Category If neither height nor weight can be measured or obtained, a likely BMI range can be estimated using the mid upper arm circumference (MUAC). Measuring MUAC (see Fig. 1) 1. The resident should be standing or sitting. 2. Use left arm if possible and ask resident to remove clothing so arm is bare. 3. Locate the top of the shoulder (acromion) and the point of the elbow (olecranon process). 4. Measure the distance between the 2 points, identify the mid point and mark on the arm. See Fig. 2 5. Ask the resident to let arm hang loose and with tape measure, measure circumference of arm at the mid point. 6. Do not pull the tape measure tight - it should just fit comfortably round the arm.Alternative measurements and considerations Alternative measurements: instructions and tables If height cannot be obtained, use length of forearm (ulna) to calculate height using tables below. (See The 'MUST' Explanatory Booklet for details of other alternative measurements (knee height and demispan) that can also be used to estimate height). Estimating height from ulna length Measure between the point of the elbow (olecranon process) and the midpoint of the prominent bone of the wrist (styloid process) (left side if possible). Estimating BMI category from mid upper arm circumference (MUAC) The subject's left arm should be bent at the elbow at a 90 degree angle, with the upper arm held parallel to the side of the body. Measure the distance between the bony protrusion on the shoulder (acromion) and the point of the elbow (olecranon process). Mark the mid-point. Ask the subject to let arm hang loose and measure around the upper arm at the mid-point, making sure that the tape measure is snug but not tight. If MUAC is <23.5 cm, BMI is likely to be <20 kg/m2. If MUAC is >32.0 cm, BMI is likely to be >30 kg/m2. The use of MUAC provides a general indication of BMI and is not designed to generate an actual score for use with 'MUST'.

MUAC needs to be measured repeatedly over a period of time, preferably taking 2 measurements on each occasion and using the average of the 2 figures. Note: Without further evidence it is not possible to assign absolute values to measurements of MUAC or percentage changes. xii. Calculating Ideal Body Weight (IBW) (for dietitian use only) The most common method to calculate IBW is the Hamwii method (Breen & Ireton-Jones). Women IBW (kg) = 45.45 kg + 2.27 kg for each 2.54 cm (1 inch) over 1.52 cm (5 foot) Men IBW (kg) = 50 kg + 2.73 kg for each 2.54 cm (inch) over 1.52 cm (5 foot).If MUAC changes by at least 10% then it is likely that weight and BMI have changed by approximately 10% or more.Toolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 202038 39 Breakfast Cereal/Porridge (bowl) < \u00bd \u00bd \u00be 1 Toast/Bread (slice) \u00bd Butter (pack) < \u00bd \u00bd 1 2 Marmalade (teaspoon) < \u00bd \u00bd 2 Sugar (teaspoon) < \u00bd \u00bd 1 2 3 Mid Morning Tea/Coffee (cup/mug) \u00bd 1 Milk Snack: < /Chicken/fish (portion) \u00bd 1 2 Casserole/Pie/Bake/Stew (portion) \u00bd 1 Potato (whole/scoops) < \u00bd 1 2 3 Pasta/Rice (portion) < \u00bd \u00bd 1 2 3 Vegetables < \u00bd \u00bd 1 Dessert: < \u00bd \u00bd 1 Salad: < \u00bd \u00bd 1 Bread (slices) \u00bd \u00bd 1 2 Butter (pack) < \u00bd \u00bd < \u00bd \u00bd 1 Other: < \u00bd \u00bd 1 Supper (or other snacks or drinks) < \u00bd \u00bd 1 2 < \u00bd \u00bd 1 2 Oral Nutritional Supplements Sip Drink: < \u00bd \u00bd 1 1\u00bd 2 Pudding : < \u00bd \u00bd 1 1\u00bd 2 2.6 Sample Food Fluid Record Chart Resident Name: Unit/House: Day: Date: Toolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 202040 2.7 Community Education Programmes For areas providing this cookery programme contact your local community dietitian manager, contact details available on www.hse.ie/nutritionsupports at https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/ list/2/primarycare/community-funded-schemes/nutrition-supports/healthcare-professionals/ community-dietetics-referrals-updated-july-2019.pdfA Community Based Nutrition and Cooking Programme The aims of the Healthy Food Made Easy course are: To Encourage healthy eating To improve our knowledge of nutrition when preparing our meals at home To eat healthy meals on a budget This is a 6 week course: 2 - 2\u00bd hour sessions per week.

It's a two way process. Communication enables us to: Get a message across and share information Make choices and have control Express our needs, likes and dislikes Express our identity Have friendships, relationships and connections In general, three key aspects of communication should be considered when planning supportive communication in relation to nutrition, hydration and mealtimes. These are: (i) Understanding the individual's own communication profile (Table 7). (ii) Establishing a supportive communication environment (Table 8) (iii) Identifying supportive communication partners (Table 8)SECTION 3.0 Communication Toolkit Toolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 202042 43 Table 7: Understanding the Individual's Own Communication Profile Area of CommunicationExamples Impact on nutrition, hydration and mealtimes Receptive Communication (i.e. how people understand information)Understanding Symbols: information can be presented in different symbolic forms: Objects, photographs, pictures, words are all different kinds of symbols. People with disabilities will have differing levels of understanding. Some might respond better to objects; others to photos etc. It is important to know how the person best understands information when you are offering choices or having conversations with them about their food preferences.Ability to make choices dependent on how choices are symbolically represented (show real food/photo/drawing/menu). Language Processing (i.e. understanding verbal information): Processing 'wh' questions - who, what, where, when, what happened, why Understanding choices and often choosing the last option provided; Concepts (e.g. hot/cold; on/under; more/less; before/after; first/then) Vocabulary - Many different words are used describe the same thing e.g. squash, pop, high-juice, cordial, miwadi, dilute Longer Sentences (e.g. causal relationships - if you decide to drink your tea without thickener, then you may get sick) Understanding negatives e.g. 'there's no bread', 'there isn't any bread' - can be easily missed for a person with comprehension difficulties and the sentence may be understood to have the opposite meaning and as a consequence lead others to think the person is being difficult. Ability to anticipate when meals will be happening Ability to understand how they can contribute/ exercise choice around their mealtimes Ability to understand instructions before, during and after mealtimes Understanding and adhering to Feeding, Eating, Drinking and Swallowing (FEDS) recommendations.Toolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 202044 Area of CommunicationExamples Impact on nutrition, hydration and mealtimes Expressive Communication (i.e. how someone gets their message across)Use of various modes of expressive communication to express needs, wants, preferences around mealtimes: Non verbal communication (body language, eye contact, facial expression) Vocalisations Objects of Reference Signs (L\u00e1mh) Picture-based communication (visuals, visual timetable, PECS) Words - clear or unclear Sentences.If the person's expressive communication is not understood by communication partners, this may lead to: Interaction being reduced during mealtimes Person experiencing limited or no control in relation to their nutrition and hydration preferences Person making less communication attempts Reduced independence and autonomy Frustration and behaviours that challenge due to unsuccessful communication attempts (e.g. if requesting more or requesting something different to eat/drink) Impact on intake (e.g. if the person indicates a different food preference but this is not understood or responded to). Social CommunicationA person with reduced social communication skills may have difficulty: Initiating and maintaining conversations Asking and responding to questions Communicating in 1:1 or in group situations Communicating with new or less familiar communication partners Responding to verbal and non- verbal cues. Ability to socially engage with others at mealtime activities Ability to build relationships with their peers during mealtimes Ability to appropriately make requests, object, refuse or end mealtimes Possible negative impact experienced by other residents in the house and their experiences of mealtimes as a group.Toolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 202044 45 Area of CommunicationExamples Impact on nutrition, hydration and mealtimes Executive FunctioningMemory Cognitive ability impacts on how a person remembers to complete tasks.May need verbal or visual supports to remember how to complete tasks (e.g. setting the table, eating, tidying up). Attention Ability to regulate own attention and/or divide attention between tasks before, during and after mealtimes. May need support during a range of activities to stay on task and complete same (e.g. shopping, cooking, meals). May be easily distracted by other people or activities while eating their food. Organising and planning Ability to sequence and complete tasks.May need guidance to successfully complete mealtime related tasks (e.g. compiling a shopping list, following a recipe etc.) Regulating emotions Managing own feelings, understanding own feelings and how to appropriately express these.May need support to cope with unexpected events (e.g. food spillages, temperature variations -too hot/too cold, busy shops). Sensory Sensory Processing Sensitivities to light/ sound / textures / smells may negatively impact on mealtime experience. A person's sensory preferences need to be considered when planning trips to the shops, restaurants and mealtimes themselves. Advice from an OT should be sought where appropriate.Toolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 202046 Area of CommunicationExamples Impact on nutrition, hydration and mealtimes Sensory Visual Impairment A visual impairment may have a significant impact on a person's level of understanding as s/he may be missing cues that aid understanding such as gesture, facial expressions, environmental cues, routines, visual aids and peer behaviours etc. May impact on a person's ability to manage food related tasks independently - food preparation, feeding themselves etc. People with significant visual impairment may experience increased stress if an unknown food or drink is being presented. Support should be sought from available HSCPs/ carers/ support staff who know the person will in planning mealtime adaptations. Hearing Impairment A hearing impairment may impact on the person's ability to understand verbal information presented to them particularly within noisy environments. They may miss particular words - leading to inappropriate responses. The person may also experience barriers in engaging in group conversations during mealtimes. Supported Decision MakingThe Assisted Decision Making Act (ADM) directs us to assume that all people have the capacity to make their own decisions and this should be our starting point in supporting those with a disability to make choices around their nutrition, hydration and mealtime preferences.People with disabilities should be supported to have their will and preferences heard and understood. This can be a complex process. The ADM Act will provide more guidance when it is fully enacted however, all support staff working with people with disabilities should be aware of its principles.Toolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 202046 47 3.2 Communication Strategies to Support Nutrition, Hydration and Mealtimes Table 8: General Communication Strategies General Communication Strategies Total Communication Approach Carers should communicate using a Total Communication Approach. This means using all forms of communication that may be needed for the individual e.g. spoken word, gesture, L\u00e1mh signs, visuals, objects. This approach advocates that all modes of communication be made available to the person e.g. speech, manual signs, photographs and pictorial symbols; alongside all the usual elements of non-verbal communication. It allows the person to use multiple ways of expressing their thoughts and feelings e.g. pointing, taking someone by the hand, signing. A person may have additional sensory impairments, so when the Total Communication Approach is used the person is receiving the message through multiple senses. Total Communication increases success in both understanding and expression.Toolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 202048 General Communication Strategies Establishing a supportive communication environment1. Space, light and layout: Ensure there are comfortable places to communicate Ensure you can see peoples' faces when they are communicating Rearrange layout to suit different opportunities for communicating if necessary. 2. Noise levels: What is the general level of noise like? Are the noise distractions from inside or outside the environment? Are there ways to gain people's attention? Can the person hear or be heard? 3. Using visual support: Are signs, symbols, photos, writing used? Are they used as labels, or to support routines, or as timetables? Are the right visual supports available for the needs of the resident? 4. Clear and consistent routines: Does the person know what to expect and when? How well are visual supports used to help people understand and follow routines? 5. The role of carers/support staff in the environment: What skills/approaches do support staff use to listen to/ speak with/communicate with people in the environment? Are staff members aware of the communication systems / skills used by each person? 6. How opportunities are planned and created to support communication? Be familiar with how a person's communication opportunities are created; do they use their device throughout the mealtime? Do they use a visual schedule to plan the structure of their mealtime? How are they motivated to communicate?Toolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 202048 49 General Communication Strategies Identifying supportive communication partnersThe 4 S's: Say Less - Reduce language to key words Stress - Add stress to the key works Go Slow - Slow rate of speech Show - Use visuals/objects related to what is being said. Make it easier to pay attention Gain the person's attention, reduce distractions, reduce background noise and make sure the person can see your face. Make listening easier Use simplified (reduced) language, chunk instructions and information. Make it visual Use visual supports (pictures/photographs/objects). Make it multimodal Use a total communication approach (gestures, visuals, L\u00e1mh, body language, facial expressions). Give time Some people need 10 or more seconds to process and respond to verbal information. Remember some people may consistently choose the last choice and this may be indicative of delayed language processing. Change the order of choices to double check the accurate answer is being given.Toolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 202050 3.3 Communication Tools to Support Nutrition, Hydration and Mealtimes i. Visual Supports What are Visual Supports? This refers to using pictures or other visual items to support communication for an individual who has difficulty understanding or using language. These can be objects, photographs, drawings, symbols, videos and written words. One important factor to consider, when planning visual supports, is the level of symbolic understanding i.e. developmental level of understanding visual information. Speech and Language Therapy assessment can determine an individual's level of symbolic development. Visual supports have a variety of uses: First-Then board: Shows something that an individual prefers that will happen after completing a task that is less preferred. It may be used to motivate an individual to engage in a less preferred activity. Visual schedule/timetable: Shows what is going to happen throughout the day or within a task or activity. It may be helpful in increasing understanding and decreasing anxiety surrounding transitions. Choice board: Allows an individual to select between two or more choices. The number of choices will depend on the individual. Independence/self-help boards: Shows the sequence of steps in a particular skill. It is used to aid memory and comprehension. Visual timers: Provides the time remaining of an activity/until a transition or how long an individual may have to wait. Labelling environment/accessible signage: This refers to visual signage used to help orientate an individual to their surroundings e.g. pictorial signs on kitchen cupboards to show what is inside. Example from Practice: Conor is a 24 year old man with a diagnosis of ASD and is functioning within the moderate range of intellectual disability. Conor presents with anxiety if he does not know what is happening throughout his day. Staff working with Conor use a visual schedule to support Conor's understanding of his daily routine including mealtimes. Example of a Visual Menu Board: Toolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 202050 51 Example from Practice: Deirdre is a 67 year old lady with a diagnosis of Down Syndrome and is functioning within the mild range of intellectual disability. Deirdre also has a diagnosis of mid stage dementia. Making tea for her house mates is a very important part of Deirdre's day, however, Deirdre has been having some difficulties understanding and remembering the steps within this task. In order to maintain her independence with this activity, staff have created a visual independence board to display the steps in making a cup of tea. The board is placed beside the kettle and allows Deirdre to follow the steps by herself. Example from Practice: Cherry Lane is a community residential home where four woman with intellectual disabilities live. Once a week the ladies meet with staff to plan their menus for the week. They use a visual menu board to pick and choose what meals they would like. The visual menu board for a particular day is then displayed in their kitchen as a reminder to everyone what meals have been planned.Example of an Independence Board: 1. Put water in the kettle 5. Get the milk from the fridge2. Turn on kettle to boil the water 6. Put a teabag in the cup3. Get a cup from the press 7. Pour the boiling water in the cup4. Take out the teabags 8. Pour milk into the cup Example of a Choice Board: Toolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 202052 ii. Easy Read Information What is Easy Read Information? Easy to Read documents are made up of short, simple sentences that will communicate the most important messages you need to get across. These are usually accompanied by pictures that will aid understanding. The 'document' might be a letter, a poster, a form, an instruction booklet or a version of a more complicated report. Many organisations have their own policies regarding creating easy read information. The Irish Association of Speech & Language Therapists (I.A.S.L.T) have created a guidance document for making information easy read: https://www.iaslt.ie/documents/public-information/Alternative%20and%20Supported%20 Communication/Make-it- Easy-December-2011.pdf Example from Practice: Bartek is a 32 year old man functioning within the mild range of intellectual disability. Bartek loves cooking, however, he finds it difficult to follow recipes in standard cook books. Bartek uses a 'Just Look and Cook' book that has recipes in a pictorial format to support his ability to follow a recipe. Staff supporting Bartek also create easy read recipes that Bartek wants to make that aren't in the 'Just Look and Cook' book. Example of accessible recipe (from 'Just Look and Cook'):Example of Easy Read Information related to Diabetes: 11 What to do when you have Type 2 diabetesHigh blood sugar How do you know if your blood sugar is high? You may feel very thirsty. You may go to the loo a lot. You may feel more tired than usual. What to do when you have Type 2 diabetes 12Low blood sugar How do you know if your blood sugar is low? You may feel shaky or dizzy. You may feel sweaty. You may feel very tired and grumpy. Toolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 202052 53 iii. Personal Communication Dictionary What is a Personal Communication Dictionary? A personal communication dictionary (also known as gesture dictionary) is a document that helps to outline the ways in which an individual communicates through recording and suggesting meanings for a person's unique gestures, body language, facial expressions and vocalisations. This is important for individuals who rely on others to interpret their communication and don't communicate through methods such as speech, writing or symbols. A communication dictionary can help to ensure that all communication partners are aware of the individual's communication behaviours and agree on how to respond. To create a communication dictionary, people who know an individual will need to observe and describe the person's behaviours, interpret what these behaviours mean and then agree on an appropriate response. Example from Practice: Frank is a 50 year old man functioning within the severe-profound range of intellectual disability. Frank is living in a shared residential service in the community. Frank communicates primarily through body language, movement, facial expressions, simple gestures and some vocalisations and relies on others to interpret what he is trying to communicate. There is a high turn over of staff in Frank's home and as result new and unfamiliar agency staff are frequently working with Frank. In order to ensure that all people working with Frank understand what he is communicating and how to respond, familiar communication partners and staff have created a Personal Communication Dictionary for Frank. Toolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 202054 iv. 'Touch Cues'/ 'On Body Cues'/ 'On Body Signs'? This refers to a tactile communication system that involves the communication partner pointing, drawing or making varied hand shapes and movements directly onto the face, arms, torso or legs of the person. This approach is referred to by a variety of different names i.e. etc. These systems are frequently used to support individuals with visual and/ or hearing impairment and/or severe-profound and multiple learning disabilities who present with complex communication difficulties. Individuals and organisations can develop their own touch cue system; however, this must be well documented to ensure consistency across communication partners and environments. Canaan Barrie is a systemised body signing system designed for people with multiple disabilities and visual impairment and currently consists of 150 adapted signs. These systems are not stand alone systems and act as a complementary systems i.e. used with other approaches as part of a Total Communication Approach. Example from Practice: Michelle is a 55 year old woman with a diagnosis of visual and hearing impairment and functions within the severe- profound range of intellectual disability. Michelle communicates using body language, movement, facial expressions and some vocalisations and relies on staff to interpret her communication. Michelle has difficulty hearing words and is unable to see pictures and as a result relies on tactile methods of communication such as touch cues to help her understand. In consultation with the speech and language therapist, staff working with Michelle created a system of touch cues which was well documented to ensure consistency across all communication partners. Staff working with Michelle use a touch cue for \"eat\" to help her understand when it is time for a meal. Over time and consistency of use, Michelle has demonstrated understanding of this touch cue as she now smiles in response to use of the cue. Example of Created Touch Cue System: Toolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 202054 55 Examples of OORs choice board:v. Objects of Reference System What is an Objects of Reference (OOR) System? An Object of Reference (OOR) is a tangible, multidimensional, multisensory \"symbol\" used to represent a person, object, location or event (POLE). OORs are sets of objects that are used systematically as a means of communication. Other names for OORs include - object cues, object symbols, tactile symbols, tangible cues, tangible symbols. OORs are frequently used to support individuals with visual and/or hearing impairment and/or severe-profound and multiple learning disabilities who present with complex communication difficulties. Consistency in use of the OOR system overtime across environments and communication partners is crucial for success. Example from Practice: Kevin is a 40 year old man functioning within the severe range of intellectual disability and has an additional diagnosis of Cortical Visual Impairment (CVI). Kevin communicates through movement, body language, facial expressions, simple gestures and vocalisations. Kevin presents with difficulties with vision and as a result has difficulties understanding photographs and symbols. In collaboration with the speech and language therapist, staff working with Kevin created an OOR system to support Kevin's comprehension and choice making. All the OORs that Kevin uses and what they mean are documented so that the OORs can be consistently used across all environments. Kevin brings his OORs in a dedicated OOR bag everywhere that he goes. Staff present Kevin with the same red cup as an OOR for \"drink\" every time that he is going to have a drink. Kevin holds the OOR and staff encourage him to engage with the sensory aspects of it through touch. Over time and consistency of use, Kevin now shows anticipation of having a drink when he is presented with the OOR. Kevin is now working on using OORs to make choices with staff presenting Kevin with a choice to two familiar OORs. Kevin's ChoiceToolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 202056 vi. Communication Books and Communication Boards What is a Communication Book? It is a low-tech visual augmentative and/or alterative communication (AAC) system that represents words and/or phrases. It often contains pictures and/or symbols accompanied by a word or label and are usually organised by topic. It allows an individual to communicate messages and/or sentences by pointing to, gesturing to or looking at the pictures or symbols in the communication book. Some individuals also may use speech in combination to pointing at symbols. The way that it is created will depend on the individual's needs and abilities e.g. how many symbols on each page, and is determined through speech and language therapy input. It is important for communication partners to model how it can be used through providing aided language stimulation i.e. the communication partner points out symbols in the book as s/he interacts and communicates verbally with the individual. A communication board is a low-tech visual augmentative communication strategy that represents words and/or phrases with pictures and/or symbols on one board and is usually organised around a particular topic e.g. dinner, ordering in a restaurant etc. Example from Practice: Ananya is a 28 year old woman functioning within the mild range of intellectual disability. Ananya communicates using language at sentence level; however, she presents with significantly decreased speech intelligibility i.e. unfamiliar listeners have difficulties understanding what she is saying. Ananya uses her communication book to augment her speech when she is talking to people. Ananya brings her communication book with her everywhere she goes. One way in which she uses her communication book is to order food when she goes out to eat. Ananaya's communication book is very important socially, particularly when chatting to friends in cafes. Example of Communication Board for Lunch: It's Time for Lunch! I want my... Sandwich YumPlease open my... Drink GrossI need help! Fruit More pleaseI'm finished! Snack foods NoThank you Napkin YesToolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 202056 57 vii. Augmentative & Alternative Communication (AAC) Devices What are AAC Devices? AAC devices are medium-tech and high- tech devices that produce synthesised speech and/ or can record words and phrases. AAC devices range from simple voice output devices such as a Big Mack, to communication apps on the iPad, to very sophisticate high-tech devices such as eye gaze systems. The type of AAC device that is suitable for an individual and the way that a device is set up depends on the individual's needs and abilities and is determined through speech and language therapy input. AAC devices can be accessed in different ways depending on the skills of the individual e.g. directly activating a device by pressing buttons, switches, eye gaze etc. It is important for communication partners to model how a device can be used through providing aided language stimulation. Example from Practice: Rae is a 22 year old female functioning within the moderate range of intellectual disability. Rae primarily communicates using the SoundingBoard app on the iPad. Rae presents with difficulties with upper limb function and as a result uses a switch to access the communication buttons. Rae uses the SoundingBoard app to order food from her favourite fast food restaurant. Staff supporting Rae have added pictures of all the foods available in that restaurant so that Rae can make a choice and order her food independently. Example of switch accessed iPad and a communication page from the SoundingBoard app on the iPad: Toolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 202058 viii. Talking Mats What are Talking Mats? Talking Mats is a visual framework used to help people to communicate more effectively through aiding people to understand decisions and express opinions. Talking Mats is a tool that aids both comprehension and expression. It is an interactive tool that uses three sets of pictures (topics, options and a visual scale) and a space to display them (see picture below). Once the topic is chosen, the participant is given the options related to this one at a time and asked to think about what they feel about each one. They can then place the symbol under the appropriate visual scale symbol to indicate what they feel. Talking Mats is not a stand-alone resource for replacing existing methods of communication but a tool to augment communication for specific situations. Talking Mats is suitable for individuals with symbolic understanding and works best for individuals that can understand at least 2 key pieces of information. Example from Practice: Neil is a 25 year old man with a diagnosis of Down Syndrome and is functioning within the mild range of intellectual disability. Neil communicates verbally. Neil presents with difficulties with language processing, attention and memory. Neil is working with the dietician regarding losing weight. With the support of a Speech and Language Therapist, the dietician decided to use a Talking Mat with Neil to explore his understanding of losing weight and planning things that can help. The dietician identified the topic of 'losing weight' and options related to this e.g. walking, chocolate, salad, fizzy drinks etc. She decided to use a top scale of 'helping to lose weight', 'unsure' and 'not helping to lose weight'. During their meeting, the dietician presented each option to Neil one at a time and asked him what he thought about each option. The dietician used language appropriate to Neil's level of understanding and used open questions (e.g. \"what do you think of...?\") to encourage Neil's ownership of the Talking Mat. Neil placed the options under the top scale to indicate what he thought about each option. Although Neil communicates verbally, the visual framework of the Talking Mat ensured Neil had time to process what was being discussed, reduced memory demands and allowed Neil and the dietician to easily review what they had discussed and agreed. Toolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 202058 59 ix. Social Stories What are Social Stories? Social stories are short descriptions of a particular situation, event or activity, which include specific information about what to expect in that situation and what is expected of the person in that situation. Social stories are a tool used to support understanding and often have pictures to further support each piece of information/sentence to further enhance the person's understanding. It is important to consider a person's individual communication strengths and needs when determining if a social story is the appropriate strategy for the person you are working with. Example from Practice: Aisling is a 30 year old woman with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder and functioning within the moderate range of intellectual disability. Aisling communicates primarily using words and short phrases. Aisling likes to go out to eat; however, she can become very anxious in situations if she doesn't know what is going to happen. As a result of this, she has recently begun refusing to go out to restaurants and caf\u00e9s. One strategy that staff working with Aisling have tried is creating and using a social story about going out to a restaurant. Staff read through the social story with her just before going out to the restaurant. This social story supports Aisling to understand and anticipate what will happen (e.g. \"I will have to wait for a table\") and what is expected of her in this situation (e.g. \"I will tell the waiter what I want to eat\"). Example of social story for going out to a restaurant: I am going to a Restaurant I am going to a Restaurant.I will choose something to eat and drink. I will go to the restaurant in a car.I will tell the waiter/waitress what I want to eat and drink. I might have to wait for a table.I must stay sitting in my seat when I am in the restaurant. There may be lots of people and lots of noise.When my food comes I will eat it. I will sit down at the table when it is ready.I will pay for my food and drink when I am leaving. I will look at the menu.Going to a restaurant can be fun!Toolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 202060 x. Video Modelling What is Video Modelling? Video modelling is a resource that uses video recording to help teach by providing a visual model of the targeted behaviour, or skill. An example of video modelling is 'basic video modelling'. Basic video modelling involves recording someone (not the individual) engaging in the target behaviour, or skill. The video is then watched by the individual at a later time. Another example is 'video self-modelling'. This is used to record the individual displaying the target skill, or behaviour, and this then reviewed later by the individual. The aim is that the individual will watch these videos and then imitate the skill/behaviour themselves. Example from Practice: Michelle is a 35 year old woman with a diagnosis of moderate intellectual disability and ASD. Michelle communicates primarily using words and short phrases. Michelle recently moved into a residential service after living at home with her elderly mother. Michelle was finding it difficult to adjust to the new routines during mealtimes. Following a discussion between Michelle and her key worker, Michelle decided that she would like to help with the breakfast mealtime preparation. To help her remember the routine, and prepare for it, Michelle's key worker supported her to set the table for breakfast, while it was being video recorded on her tablet. That evening, Michelle's key worker sat down with her to plan for the following day. They looked back over the video and discussed the routine. The next day Michelle watched the video to support her in completing the task.Toolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 202060 61 xi. All About Me/Communication Passport What is an 'All About Me'? A person's 'All About Me' is a record of the person's life as it is now, completed in order to have a starting point for planning and imagining change. It includes information about the person's skills, their past, their interests, what is important to them, what their typical week looks like etc. This information is used to help you, and the person, to think about what their future looks like and what goals they may have. What is a Communication Passport? Communication Passports describes, in detail, how a person communicates and how others should communicate with them. They are practical and person centred documents. Information is clear and easy to understand and presented in an accessible way, if meaningful to the person. They are helpful when new staff meet the person, to know how best to help an individual with a disability communicate. Communication Passports aim to support people with complex communication difficulties who cannot easily speak for themselves. Many people with complex communication needs use informal ways of communicating such as touch, movements, sounds, smells, objects and experiences. It is important that this informal communication is recognised, valued and respected. A communication passport is a way of recognising and recording these forms of communication and passing on valuable information to other people. Example from Practice: Paul is a 26 year old man with a diagnosis of moderate intellectual disability. Paul communicates primarily using some words, L\u00e1mh and visuals. Paul really enjoys cooking dinner for himself on a Saturday, with the support of staff. Recently in Paul's residential unit there have been some changes to the staff team. This has meant that Paul is being supported by new staff members on the days he likes to cook. Paul has been getting upset as some new staff did not understand what Paul was saying and they ended up making food that Paul does not like. This resulted in Paul's key worker creating a Communication Passport for Paul and updating his All About Me to include his food preferences. Now, when a new staff member starts in the unit, and are working with Paul on a Saturday, they are firstly directed to Paul's Communication Passport to learn about how they can communicate with Paul and how he may communicate with them. They are also directed to review Paul's All About Me where they can find out Paul's food preferences.Toolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 202062 All about me: Communication Passport: Toolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 202062 63 xii. E-Tran frame What is e-tran frame? An e-tran frame looks like a photo frame but it has a cut-out in the centre of the frame. It is made from a see-through material, e.g. perspex glass. Pictures or objects can be attached to the edges of the frame. The number of items on the frame will depend on the user's cognitive and choice-making ability. The frame is placed in front of the user and the communication partner sits opposite. The person uses eye pointing to refer to pictures/ objects. The communication partner watches, through the cut-out, which picture/object the person's eyes are pointing to. Example from Practice: Jane is a teenager who is very interested in watching what is happening; expressing her choices and telling her news. She has a severe intellectual disability and a physical disability of quadriplegia. Jane is nonverbal but communicates using vocalisations, eye pointing, facial expressions, some limited trunk movements and an E-tran frame to communicate. Yesterday, in her day centre, the group were deciding on what they would cook in Home Economics. Everyone in the class had a vote and the choice with the highest votes would win. Jane's keyworker placed the pictures of the choices on her E-tran frame and held it up for Jane to see. Jane looked at all the choices and decided on salmon mousse. Jane's keyworker looked through the plexus glass of the E-tran board and followed Jane's eye pointing. Jane's keyworker asked Jane if she had decided on salmon mousse. Jane confirmed by smiling and making a slight trunk movement and her vote was added to the classes' choice.

Pictorial Exchange Communication System (PECS) What is Pictorial Exchange Communication System (PECS)? PECS is a communication system to support people to learn how to communicate intentionally by approaching another person and giving them a picture of an item in exchange for the physical item. A person can use the system to communicate a request and make a comment provided that they can be symbolised in a picture-format. Example from Practice: Mark is an adult with a severe intellectual disability and autism. Staff are sometimes unsure of Mark's communication attempts as Mark's communication is not always clear and directed to others. Mark loves mealtimes as staff observe that he smiles and uses excited vocal tone. Recently, Mark has begun to engage in behaviours that challenge at mealtimes. One staff observed that Mark had got frustrated as staff had forgotten to give him his drink. Staff linked with the speech and language therapist for help with encouraging Mark to become more independent in asking for drinks/food. Together, they decided on using PECS as a tool to support Mark's understanding of intentional communication and use his interest in mealtimes as motivators. Staff received training and used the structured prompting system consistently. After a number of months, Mark is still in phase 1 but is beginning to take the picture off and hand it to a communication partner sitting next to him, without any physical cueing. This is a great start to helping Mark understand how asking leads to getting his favourite drink. Toolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 202064 65 xiv. Community Request Cards What are Community Request Cards? Community Request Cards are for people who want to make requests for items or services in the community. They promote autonomy by allowing the person to communicate their message as independently as possible. Example from Practice: Jennifer is a 30 year old woman with a moderate intellectual disability and autism. Jennifer is a keen communicator and those who know her well understand her messages. Jennifer communicates using a range of her own signs, L\u00e1mh, body language and some visuals (photographs). Jennifer enjoys going to her local restaurant for a coffee with her key worker. The staff there know Jennifer well. As a 30 year old woman, Jennifer prefers to order for herself. She uses her community request card (pictured here) to order her cappuccino at the counter and then takes a seat. Jennifer needed supported initially to learn the routine of handing over the card and waiting for the purchase/order to be made. The restaurant staff also needed coaching to know how to give her extra time to use the card and to acknowledge and respond to Jennifer's request. Through weekly practice, the system is up and running and hopefully Jennifer will learn to use this and other community request cards in new situations. Toolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 202066 xv. L\u00e1mh What is L\u00e1mh? L\u00e1mh is a sign system designed for and with people with intellectual disabilities and other communication needs in Ireland. It is a sign system that uses speech and signs key words in each phrase/sentence. Example from Practice: Paul is a young man with a moderate intellectual disability who lives a busy life and has a wide range of friends and family. Paul has a great sense of humour and enjoys communicating with his peers, family and staff. Paul uses L\u00e1mh as his main form of communication; staff and family use L\u00e1mh daily with Paul when communicating messages with him. He also uses some visual supports (photographs and photosymbols). Paul likes to know the meal plan for his week. His food is very important to him. Each Sunday, Paul, his key worker and the other residents in his house put together the weekly meal planner. They use a combination of visuals and L\u00e1mh signs to discuss choices and options for each day of the week. Once decisions have been made, Paul and his key worker put together a weekly visual timetable to represent this. Each morning, Paul uses his L\u00e1mh signs (e.g. Monday, dinner, pasta) to check in on the plan with his key worker. Paul is a competent signer. His use of L\u00e1mh sign enables him to feel in control over his weekly meal planner, to contribute to group decision making and to ask questions if he forgets any of the details. Paul's staff need to remember to use L\u00e1mh signs with Paul and the House Manager regularly sends them on L\u00e1mh training to refresh their skills.

Algorithm for Management of Chronic Constipation of Adults within the Community `MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC CONSTIPATION OF ADULTS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY DIET AND FLUID A well -balanced diet and full hydration maintain bowel function.26 Low fibre diet is a risk factor33 Dietary fibre can increase stool frequency in mild to moderate constipation.43 Fibre supplementation is a safe alternative to laxatives for institutionalised elderly.6 Increase fibre and fluid gradually for best effect.4 Increasing fluid intake has little benefit if fully hydrated.25 Probiotics can improve bowel function.2 Fibre : 18 -32 titrated according to response38 Fluid : 1.5 -2 litres per day18 (assuming no cardiac or renal restrictions34)LAXATIVES Positive effects with short term use and if meeting specified indicators for use. When other non - pharmacological methods have been tried and are ineffective25,36 Evidence is strongest for use of psyllium, and PEG25,36,37 Prucalopride is effective for women where laxatives fail to provide adequate relief7,9,13,37 No research evidence to support use of stimulant laxatives, lubricants or stool softeners44 For adverse effects with long term use see reverse.OTHER STRATEGIES The following techniques may be of benefit: Abdominal Massage : non -invasive approach with no adverse effects reported.27,28May be cost effective.31 Biofeedback : treatment of choice for dyssyneria. To be considered if other measures have failed.12,32 Behavioural therapies21 Rectal/Trans -anal Irrigation can improve outcomes with intractable constipation.9,39 Rectal Digital Stimulation18 TOILETING Consider: Regular Toileting posture15 Adapted toilet seating18 Functional defecation training15,20EXERCISE Physical inactivity is a risk factor and should be addressed33 Effects of exercise: Increased stool propulsion 22 Improved defecation 41 Types of exercise: walking & general activity35 cycling22 strength & flexibility programme41MANAGEMENT AND EDUCATION CC has a variety of identifiable causes and possible mechanisms. It is essential to understand the individual and treat accordingly9,36 A multidisciplinary team should follow care pathways to develop an individualised bowel management plan addressing identified problems, with continual documented assessment18,40 Education of client and carer is necessary to underpin clinical treatment 9,40.BASELINE ASSESSMENT To establish severity of constipation and impact on QoL. Detailed history of bowel patterns17,20 Stool assessment e.g. CAS29, CSS10, BFI8, EBSQ30OBJECTIVE : To provide guidance based on current best evidence, to aid decision making in the management of CC by health staff in the community. Exclusions: Children, pregnancy, bowel disease, surgical intervention, neoplasm. DEFINITION : Chronic constipation (CC) : functional GI disorder onset at least 6 months with 2 or more of following symptoms for at least 3 months: fewer than 3 spontaneious bowel movements/week; any of these for more than 25% of defecations: -straining; lumpy or hard stools; sensation of incomplete evacuation; sensation of anorectal blockage; manoeuvres to facilitate defecation. Loose stools rarely present without laxative use. Insufficient criteria for IBS.1 CC associated with significantly higher prevalence and incidence of cancer and benign neoplasm. The risks are increased with severity of constipation.3 Identifying subtypes of patients with CC will guide subsequent therapeutic choices.5 Primary: 3 subtypes: normal transit, slow transit and evacuation disorder. Secondary : secondary to medications, obstruction, metabolic, neurological, systemic, psychiatric disorders.7 GLOSSARY OF TERMS BFI: subjective assessment of ease of defecation over 7 days8 CAS: 8 point assessment of severity of constipation29 CSS: Questionnaire indicating severity of constipation10 EBSQ: Bowel symptom questionnaire for elderly at home30 Valsalva manoeuvre (e.g. Peristeen Irrigation Kit) Toileting posture: sitting with stabilised trunk, leaning forward to create < 90 \u00b0hip angle.

This helps assess how long the stool has spent in the bowel. Type 1 has spent the longest time in the bowel and type 7 the least time. A normal stool should be a type 3 or 4, and depending on the normal bowel habits of the individual, should be passed once every one to three days. Separate hard lumps, like nuts (hard to pass) Sausage shaped but lumpy Like a sausage but with cracks on the surface Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft Soft blobs with clear c ut edges (passed easily) Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool Watery, no solid pieces, entirely liquid Bristol Stool Chart Image reproduced by kind permission of Dr K Heaton, Reader in M edicine , University of Bristol.

Supporting a Person at Risk of Malnutrition These resources could be considered for use in aiding individuals to get more nourishment from their meals.Toolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 202096 iii. Food Fortification A Fortified (high calorie, high protein) diet should be followed when: Appetite/ intake is poor Person is unintentionally losing weight Person is already underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2 in an adult) To Increase Calories and Protein using everyday foods: Encourage little and often meal pattern with nourishing snacks in between meals Aim for 1 pint full fat milk/day. Can be used to make up sauces, soup, hot drinks Include protein sources at least 2-3 times a day, if possible Good sources of protein: dairy foods, meat, fish, poultry, pulses, nuts and eggs. To Fortify Foods & Drinks: Fortified Milk: Whisk 4 tablespoons of milk powder (e.g. Marvel) into 1 pint of full fat milk to increase calories and protein. Use within 1 day. Full fat Natural/Greek Yoghurt: Can be used on desserts, milkshakes, and can be mixed with fruit Cream: Add to soup, desserts, drinks, potatoes, scrambled eggs, sauces. Ice Cream: Add to milk shakes and puddings. Butter: Add to potato and vegetables, spread thickly onto bread/scones. Sugar: Add to drinks, cereals and puddings Jam/Honey: Spread on bread or scones Eggs: Can be used in many ways (poached / boiled / scrambled). Cheese: Sprinkle grated cheese into soups, sauces, egg dishes or onto fish, potatoes and vegetables. Ideas for Light Meals/ Snacks: Cheese/beans on buttered toast Small sandwich / bread roll with fish, meat, cheese or egg (add mayonnaise) Full fat Cheese on crackers Or Savoury biscuits with cheese spread. Scrambled egg / omelette with added cheese/ham/mushrooms. Tinned/packet soup - make up with full fat milk. Add chopped cooked meat if liked, add cream for extra calories, serve with buttered bread Cereal with fortified milk/cream and sugar. Scone/biscuits with butter and jam Or Toast/crumpets with butter and jam. Baked potato with butter/mayonnaise filled with cheese/coleslaw/minced meat. Small portions of pizza /quiche /flan. Ideas for Desserts: Milk puddings - tinned or made with milk, add extra cream Yogurt / Fromage Frais - 'thick & creamy' varieties instead of 'diet' or 'low fat'. Pot of mousse / trifle / jelly and ice cream Custard and fruit (fresh, tinned or stewed) Milk shakes - add cream or ice cream Apple tart and cream Ideas for Nourishing Drinks: Sometimes if a person's appetite for solid foods is poor, nourishing drinks may be a better option. Offer some of the following: Hot milky drinks e.g. horlicks, ovaltine, cocoa, hot chocolate Cold drinks, e.g. cold milk, milk shakes with added ice cream/unsweetened fruit juice Soup - made with milk instead of water Complan, Build-Up, etc. (make with milk).

There are two types of fibre found in the food that we eat: 1. Insoluble Fibre is the name given to the part of food which cannot be broken down when eaten. This undigested product helps promote regular healthy bowel movements. 2. Soluble Fibre is fermented in the gut and can help the good bacteria in our gut thrive which also improves our bowel health. It can also help with keeping our cholesterol levels healthy and improve our heart health! What foods are high in Fibre? Fruit and Vegetables: A variety is best - fresh, frozen, tinned and stewed or dried fruits. Add vegetables to soups, stews, casseroles. Eat the skins of fruit where possible. Include salad vegetables in sandwiches and with meals. Half a small glass prune juice per day can often help bowels move. Breakfast Cereals: Porridge, Branflakes, All-Bran, Fruit n' Fibre, Weetabix, Shredded Wheat, and Muesli. Oats contain both and insoluble fibre. Breads and Starchy Foods: Wholemeal, Wholegrain and Granary Bread. Jacket Potatoes, Brown Rice, Wholewheat Pasta are better than the white options. Protein Rich foods high in Fibre: Beans and pulses including peas, lentils, baked beans, butter beans, kidney beans, chickpeas and many more beans. Unsalted nuts and seeds - can be added to curries, salads, cereals, yoghurt. Biscuits and Crackers and snacks: Wholemeal varieties for example, Digestive, Hobnobs, Oatcakes, Fig rolls. Wholewheat crackers or Rye crisp breads and Ryvita. Unsalted popcorn as a snack after meals. Fluids: When eating a high fibre diet remember to drink plenty of fluids.

Toolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 2020100 101 5.6 Fluid Fact Sheet The importance of Fluids - Why do I need to drink? Water is necessary for life! We need it to get rid of waste products from the body, and to replace fluid we lose from breathing and sweating. If we don't replace this fluid, we can run the risk of becoming dehydrated. As a result you may feel tired, suffer from nausea and constipation, or have headaches. How can I tell if I am drinking enough? You will know if your urine is pale and straw-like in colour (see colour chart below). If you regularly pass darker coloured urine, it is a good idea to drink a little more. First thing in the morning, it is normal for urine to be a little darker in colour due to being stored in the bladder overnight. How much fluid should I have in a day? It can vary how much you require depending on your age and weight. For most people 8-10 cups per day is enough. This fluid can include water, tea, milk, and fruit juice. You don't have to drink bottled or filtered water; tap water is fine. If you have a fever, or the weather is warm or you have sweated more than usual due to exercise, have an extra couple of glasses per day. I don't have like water - what else can I drink? If you like hot drinks try weak tea, add a slice of lemon to warm water, or be adventurous and try some fruit or herb teas like camomile or peppermint. If you like cold drinks water is a good start. Milk and fruit juices are also options. If you don't like drinking plain water, try using some diluted squash or a dash of fruit juice for extra flavour. Are there any drinks I should avoid? Strong coffee, strong tea, and some fizzy drinks (particularly the cola types) contain caffeine. Taking a lot of drinks containing caffeine can cause you to go to the toilet more often, and become dehydrated. Sugary, fizzy drinks can also cause tooth decay, extra gas and weight gain. So, if you drink a lot of these types of drinks try swapping to some of the other ones mentioned above. As with any lifestyle changes, do it gradually. If you don't drink much at the moment, build it up over a few weeks with fluids you enjoy!

Can be difficult to diagnose Coughing vs. Choking Coughing Aspiration can result in coughing. Coughing is the body's way of getting food, liquid, and any other object out of the airway. It also keeps things from going into the lungs. Coughing is a good thing because that means the body feels something go into the airway. Blockage/Choking This is when food becomes lodged and either partially or totally blocks the airway Very dangerous and can result in death If the person cannot cough it out the Heimlich manoeuvre may need to be administered Reproduced with kind permission from Ron\u00e1n Brady, Speech and Language Therapist, Adult Team, St. Michael's House, Dublin.Toolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 2020106 107 SECTION 7.0 Food Service Section Title 7.0 Food Service 108 7.1 Menu Planning Resource 108 Toolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 2020108 7.1 Menu Planning Resource i. Tips for Making Recipes Healthier Tips for Making Recipes Healthier Use low fat or skimmed milk instead of full fat milk. Use low fat spread instead of butter or margarine (look on label to make sure it states that it is suitable for cooking/baking). Use low fat cheese instead of full fat cheese. Try using less sugar than what is stated in the recipe or use a sugar substitute instead of sugar e.g. Splenda/Candarel (NOTE: in general, you only need to use 1/10th of the weight of sweetener as sugar stated in the recipe as it is lighter than sugar). Use low fat cr\u00e8me fraiche or low fat natural yoghurt instead of cream. Use Rapeseed Oil or Olive Oil instead of Butter/Margarine/Lard where recipe allows. NOTE: Use SPARINGLY as these oils have the same calories as hard fats. Use coarse brown flour instead of white flour. Remember to add a teaspoon of baking powder if you do this. Reduce suggested portion sizes from 'full size' to 'treat size' for baked goods. Don't pile the plate or bowl high with food! Use household measures outlined in menu ideas section and also have a look at the visual examples of average meals sizes to help get used to what an average portion size is from 'Food Shelf Fact Sheets' in Section 3.0.SECTION 7.0 Food ServiceToolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 2020108 109 ii.

Eating Out & Takeaways Choosing Healthier Options: Choose tomato based over creamy based sauces. Ask for sauce on the side. Avoid eating skin from chicken/fat from meat. Ask for low fat/skimmed options e.g. coffee made on low fat/skimmed milk instead of full fat milk; low fat spread. Chose boiled rice more often than fried/pilau rice. Chose boiled/jacket potatoes more often than chips/roast potatoes/ mashed potatoes Serving sizes are often much larger when eating out or getting a takeaway than an average serving size. Consider sharing between 2 or ordering 1-2 main course to share between 2-3 individuals. Chose small/regular size over large/supersized meals. Chose water or a diet drink over full sugar fizzy drinks. Share a dessert or choose a healthy starter and main course and skip dessert. What to avoid if an individual has swallowing difficulties (i.e. requires a texture modified diet): All rice Hard crunchy chips (Soft, fluffy chips allowed on Soft Texture Modified diet).Toolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 2020124 SECTION 8.0 Monitoring, Audit and EvaluationToolkit | Food Nutrition and Hydration Policy For Adults Accessing Disability Services 2020124 125 The audit tool below will assist care providers to assess their existing practices against the key recommendations in the policy body.
