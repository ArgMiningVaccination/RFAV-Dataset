Direct your principal attention to what actually happens to clients: whether the facility provides needed services and interventions; whether the facility insures clients are free fr om abuse, mistreatment, or neglect; whether clients, families and guardians participate in identifying and selecting services; whether the facility promotes greater independence, choice, integration and productivity; how competently and effectively the staff interact with clients; and whether all health needs are being met. Use observation as the primary method of information gathering. Conduct interviews and record reviews after completion of observations to confirm specific issues. Verify that the facility develops interventions and supports that address the clients' needs, and provides required client protections and health services. Do not conduct in- depth reviews of assessments, progress notes or historical data unless outcomes fail to occur for clients. The provision of active treatment includes: Comprehensive Functional Assessment (42 CFR 483.440(c)(3)) .--Each individual client's interdisciplinary team must perform accurate, comprehensive functional assessments and reassessments within 30 days after admission that identifies all of the client's: Specific developmental strengths, including client preferences; Specific functional and adaptive social skills the client needs toacquire; Any presenting disabilities, and when possible their causes; and The need for services without regard to interdisciplinary team must prepare an IPP which: \u0000 Includes opportunities for individual choice and self -management; \u0000 Identifies the discrete, measurable, criteria -based objectives the client is to achieve; \u0000 Identifies the specific individualized program of specialized and generic strategies, supports, and techniques to be employed; and \u0000 Must be directed toward the acquisition of the skills necessary for the client to function with as much self -determination and independence as possible and the Prevention or e gression or loss of current .--Each client must receive a continuous active treatment program consisting of needed interventions and services in sufficient intensity and frequency to support the achievement of IPP objectives. behaviorally -state d data about the client's performance toward meeting the IPP objectives serves as the basis for necessary change and revision to the program. (W196, W252, W253, W254, W111) Program Monitoring and Change (42 CFR 483.440(f)) .--At least annually, the comprehensive functional assessment of each client is reviewed by the interdisciplinary team for its relevancy and updated, as needed. The IPP is revised, as three levels of ICF/IID surveys. They are the focused fundamental survey, the extended survey, and the full survey. Initial certifications and annual re -certification of ICF/IIDs also requires a Life Safety Code survey (see instructions in Appendix I), which is separate from these three health surveys). A full survey must be conducted for initial certification surveys and do not require a focused fundamental survey. A focused fundamental survey should be conducted for recertification surveys, unless, the State Survey Agency determines that a full survey is warranted based on the survey agency's identification of concerns related to the provider's capacity to furnish adequate services. A recertification survey can be expanded at any time to an extended survey or to a full survey based on surveyor findings. A. Focused Fundamental Survey The focused fundamental survey may be utilized for all ICF/IID recertification surveys . In addition to the entrance and exit, the focused fundamental survey follows the procedures outlined in tasks one through three. Initial surveys will still require a full survey. The focused fundamental survey process focuses the p redominance of the survey time on the basic elements of the active treatment process. This is accomplished through the concept of regulatory standards; an emphasis on increased client observation time; and more effective use of interviews and client record reviews. During the focused fundamental survey, the primary method of information gathering is observation. Interviews and record reviews are conducted to confirm and/or provide additional information on any concerns identified during observations. Beyond the IPP and the comprehensive functional assessment (CFA), in -depth review of progress notes or historical data is not performed unless there is suspected non- compliance of a key standard. As a result, this focused fundamental survey requires less on - site survey time than the full survey while still providing sufficient information regarding the delivery of services by the facility to enable the State Survey Agency (SA) and/or CMS Regional Office (RO) to determine compliance or non- compliance with the Conditions of Participation (CoPs). The focused fundamental survey involves the identification of key s tandards within the ICF/IID CoPs from which all other standards correspond When the facility is determined to be in substantial compliance with the identified key standard, the standards corresponding from that key standard are automatically determined as being met since the key standard could not be compliant otherwise. However, if any key standard is found to be out of compliance, all regulations corresponding to the key standard (s) must be reviewed to determine compliance or non-compliance of each corre sponding standard. The SA or CMS RO must, at this point, make a decision as to whether it would be more appropriate to continue the focused fundamental survey by simply adding review of the regulations under the non- compliant key standard(s) or to convert the survey to an extended survey. The SA or CMS RO must convert the focused fundamental survey to an extended survey if standard- level deficiencies are found during survey and the survey team has determined or suspects that one or more CoPs examined during the survey may be out of compliance. The focused fundamental survey process is focused on the key standards. However, the surveyors are not precluded from reviewing or citing any of the corresponding standards if indicated during the review of the key st andards. The key standard list and the corresponding regulations associated with each key standard is provided below in Table 1. The CoP is highlighted in bold and the key standard(s) under each CoP is shaded in gray. The specified W tags under each shade d key standard are the corresponding regulations associated with that key standard.

Extended Survey During a focused fundamental survey, if a key standard of a CoP is found to be out of compliance, then the surveyor will review all corresponding standards under that key standard to determine compliance with that condition (i.e., to determine condition- level compliance). If the review of the key standard and corresponding standards could result in a condition- level non -compliance finding, then the SA can decide to survey all the standards within that CoP. This review of all the standards within an ICF/IID CoP is known as an extended survey. However, if the review of the key standard and corresponding standards results in a CoP non- compliance finding at 42 CFR 483.420, 42 CFR 483.450 or 42 CFR 483.460, then the team must convert the extended survey to a full survey and follow the procedures for a full survey as indicated below. NOTE: Neither the focused fundamental nor the extended survey processes preclude the survey agency from review of any standard, if evidence of non- compliant facility practice is suspected during any survey. C. Full Survey A full survey is a review of all of the standards within all eight ICF/IID CoPs. In addition to the entrance and exit, a full survey follows the procedures outlined in all seven tasks. A full survey is conducted when any one or more of the following criteria are met: The survey team is conducting an initial survey; An immediate jeopardy is called; The survey team determines from the extended survey that Condition -level deficiencies exist at one or more of the specific CoPs at 42 CFR 483.420, 42 CFR 483.450 or CFR 483.460; or At the discretion of the SA III - Entrance (Rev. to standard entrance procedures, the surveyor will complete the Form CMS- 3070G \"Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities Survey Report,\" to capture characteristics of the facility and the facility's population. Furthermore, the surveyor will establish the client sample selection by requesting a complete and accurate l ist of all the clients that currently reside in the facility. After the core number of clients are selected (see Task 1 below), the surveyor will request a copy of each selected client's Individual Program Plan (IPP). Each IPP will be utiliz ed during observations to determine: 1. If the client's skills matches the IPP; 2. If the IPP is being followed; 3. If staff understand the IPP; 4. Staff and client interactions during the programs; and 5. Health concerns interfering with the IPP. IV - Task One - Sample Selection (Rev. sample for the facility will include a core number of clients selected at the beginning of the survey and additional clients are added during the process of the survey as needed based on observations and/or interviews. Do not permit the facility staff to select the sample. A full review (observation, record review and interview) will be conducted on all clients in the core sample to include: 1. Compar ison of the Comprehensive Functional Assessment to the Individualized Program Plan (IPP); 2. Comparison of the IPP to actual activity observed; 3. Review of documentation of client participation and progress compared toobservations; 4. Timely and appropriate behavior program plan development and implementation as indicated; and 5. Medical assessments conducted as indicated and indicated medical care or interventions. The core sample of clients is selected from a list of the facility's curr ent client list without regard to client developmental levels or locations in the facility. At minimum, the core sample should include clients that meet any one or more of the following criteria: Admission within the last six (6) months; Participation in a day program; On a self -administration program; and/or Frequent hospitalizations or ER visits. Table 2: Guidance to Calculate Core Sample Size: Number of Clients Residing in the Facility Minimum Number in Core Sample 4 2 5-16 3 17-50 4 51-100 6 101-150 8 Over 150 10 During observations, additional clients should be added to the core sample if areas of concern are identified. Examples may include, but are not limited to: 1. Clients with significant medical involvement which may be impacting the implementation of their IPP; 2. Clients with significant behaviors with lack of or inappropriate staff intervention; 3. Clients that are idle for extended periods oftime; 4. Clients that appear to have strengths but are not encouraged to use those skills or are performing activities below their skill levels; and 5. Clients who are not provided appropriate medical care. Additional Sample Clients: A client added to the core sample, during observations, does not require a full review of his/her program record. There is no minimum or maximum number of additional clients that must be added to the core sample. The program records for clients added to the core sample (additional clients), should only be reviewed for the observed areas of conc ern. For instance, in the case of a client observed to be doing work that appears to be for the benefit of the facility, the record should be reviewed to determine whether the work is included in the client's IPP; whether fair compensation is provided; and whether the client's needs are being addressed by the facility. The client and the staff should be interviewed and the information compared to the program records. Another client may be added to the sample based solely on the fact that he/she is on a self - administration program for medication. In this case, the surveyor would focus the record review on: \u0000 Whether the comprehensive assessment supported the indication for such a program; \u0000 What the current objectives of the program are and whether the clie nt is following those objectives; and \u0000 What documentation is maintained of oversight of the objectives and whether the objectives are revised as indicated. Observations and interviews with the client and staff would focus on the medication administration . V - Task Two - Review of Facility Systems to Prevent Abuse, Neglect and Mistreatment and to Resolve Complaints determining whether or not facility systems are in place to prevent abuse, neglect, and mistreatment and to resolve complaints, surveyors will use Task Two. Task Two consists of two phases. In the absence of pre -existing characteristics as described below, only Phase One should be completed. If there are pre -existing criteria or if in the course of the survey concerns with client protections are identified, the surveyor should extend to the Phase Two review. Any one or more of the following are pre -existing criteria that would initiate a Phase Two review. \u0000 Substantiated complaints or facility reported events in Client Protections since the last recertification survey; \u0000 A survey history of citations at W127, W153 -W157; or \u0000 Concerns identified by the SA that warrant a Phase Two review. A. Task Two Phase One The critical components of this Phase are client observations including staff -to-client and client - to-client interactions, and staff/client/family interviews. These observations and interviews identify the reporting records or investigation records that will be reviewed by the surveyor. These records/reports are requested after the observations and interviews have been completed. If the surveyor determines during Phase One that there is evidence of possible abuse, neglect and mistreatment, then the surveyor s hould follow -up with associated interviews and record reviews. The surveyor should contact his or her SA for a possible Immediate Jeopardy (IJ) call. If the CoP for Client Protections at 42 CFR 483.420 is cited, then this concludes Task Two. Additional rev iew of Task Two is completed at the discretion of the SA or CMS RO. If during Phase One, the surveyor does not observe any instances of possible abuse, neglect and mistreatment, then Task Two may be ended. 1. Phase One Observations: Any signs of client injury (e.g., bruising, splints, bandages, scratches, limping or favoring a limb, etc.); Client- to-client aggression; Inappropriate staff -to-client interactions (e.g., physical, verbal); Signs of fear in the presence of specific clients or staff; Signs of mistreatment or punishment by staff such as rudeness, rough handling, restriction of rights, etc.; or Any clients currently in the hospital or experiencing recent hospitalizations or emergency room visits 2. Phase One Interviews: If Phase One observations identify any concerns with possible abuse, neglect and mistreatment, as well as failure to resolve complaints, then specifically associated interviews must be conducted. The client is interviewed first. Do not exclude clients who use alternate means of communication, such as communication boards or gestures. Most clients are able to communicate in some manner. Questions to the client may include, but are not be limited to: a. Are the staff nice to you? b. Do the staff yell, swear, or hit? Who? c. Has anyone ever hurt you? Who? When? d. Are you ever punished for anything? What was yourpunishment? e. How did you get injured? (If the client has an obviousinjury) Interview the family, legal guardian, advocates (if applicable) and close friends (if identified) of each client for whom a concern was identified either during observations or client interviews. Family members, legal guardians, advocates and close friends may be interviewed at the facility or by telephone. Questions to the families, legal guardians, advocates and close friends may include, but are not be limited to: a. Have you noticed any bruises or injuries of an unknown source on (client'sname)? b. If so, did you speak with thestaff? c. What did they say? d. How does the staff interact with (client'sname)? e. Does (client name) complain of any mistreatment duringvisits? Facility staff should be interviewed as indicated. This includes direct care staff from more than one shift, the applicable Qualified Intellectual Disability Professional (QIDP) a nd medical personnel. The goals of the interviews are to determine how often injuries/mistreatment are occurring, what process the facility is using for reporting such instances, the timeliness of notifications, whether clients are protected from harm duri ng investigations and whether process changes are implemented by the facility to prevent future injuries and/or mistreatment. The questions during each interview should be tailored according to the observations made. 3. Phase One Record Reviews: For any specific injury noted during observations (regardless of whether the client is in the sample or not), the surveyor requests the documentation associated with the injury (reporting/investigation/disposition). The goal of this documentation review is to ver ify the information provided by the staff and to ensure the prompt reporting, investigation and protection of clients with injuries and allegations of mistreatment. If the observations, interviews or record reviews during Phase One confirm that the facili ty is identifying injuries and mistreatment promptly, notifying the appropriate persons, doing appropriate investigations, and doing appropriate interventions, then Task Two is concluded. Deficiencies may be written at Phase One without proceeding to Phase Two. B. Task Two Phase Two: If the surveyor determines during Phase One that there is insufficient evidence to find that the facility is in compliance with the Condition of Participation for client protections at 42 CFR 483.420, a more global review is indicated. Request the facility log of client incidents and reports and select a sample of 5 percent of the incidents from the total client incidents occurring during the last three (3) months (a minimum of 10 if available). Request the investigative reports for these incidents. Look for any evidence that suggests that clients are being abused, neglected or mistreated. Determine whether in each case the incident was reported promptly and investigated thoroughly and that safeguards were put into pl ace during the investigation and corrective measures taken in order to prevent recurrences. If the facility has a system in place to prevent abuse, neglect and mistreatment and to resolve complaints and takes the appropriate corrective measures, then, Task Two is complete. If the 5 percent sample review is not determinative as to the compliance with the CoP for client protections, or the surveyor identifies any patterns of possible abuse, mistreatment or neglect, or the incident report logs for the past three (3) months indicate an extremely high incident rate, the surveyor should proceed to a full review of the total number of incidents and reports for the past three (3) months to identify any deficient practice by the facility. If the surveyor believes that issues exist that rise to the level of an Immediate Jeopardy, investigate and procedures in Appendix Q should be followed. VI - Task Three - Focused Observation (Rev. of the time on an ICF/IID focused fundamental survey is spent doing observation, associated interviews and associated targeted record review. It is critical that observations of sufficient duration occur across the entire survey (i.e. early morning, afternoon, and evening) and occur across the client's various environments (home, recreation and day program). A minimum of two meals must be observed and two medication pass observations must be conducted. Once the client core sample is selected and copies of the Individual Program Plan for each selected client have been obtained, the observations should begin. Do not delay beginning observations awaiting the IPPs. Begin general observations until the IPPs are provided by the facility. Initially note and record the first general impressions of each area where the clients are observed (i.e., the milieu). Conduct these observations, without intruding (unless it is necessary to alert a staff member to a possible risk to a client) for at le ast an hour in each initial location. Note things on the general milieu such as: a. Are all the clients in the area dressed appropriately but individually according to what appears to be their preferences? b. What activities are taking place? Note the time of day. Are these activities appropriate for the time of day? c. How many staff are present? d. Does the environment appear calm andpurposeful? e. What is the staff doing? How is the staff interacting with the clients? How are clients interacting with each other? f. Are clients being encouraged by the staff to participate in activities or are things done for them? g. What types of adaptive equipment or assistive devices areused? h. Do the staff use teachable moments with the clients? i. How are behavioral episodes addressed? j. Do cl ients appear well nourished? Do they appear sleepy (not early in themorning)? k. Do any clients have signs of injury? (Note for subsequent staff interview and Task 2 review.) The results of these initial observations are critical to the focused fundamental survey process on two levels. The surveyor(s) may observe specific issues which would indicate further investigation or additional clients may need to be added to the core sample. The SA may determine that, based upon the overall initial observation findings, the facility will require an extended or full survey rather than a focused fundamental. Focused Observation Areas: 1. Active Treatment - Each IPP must be appropriate for the client based upon a comprehensive assessment and revised with changes in client program needs. The IPP must correspond to what treatments, programs or services the client is actually receiving. Programs should be appropriate for the client (i.e., is the client able to accomplish/complete the program too easily; have they already accomplished the components of the program; or does the client have program needs that have not been addressed by the IPP (e.g., ADL, behavioral , socialization))? If there are discrepancies with the IPP programs after observing the client in several environments, the surveyor should speak with the client and/or appropriate staff (QIDP, direct care staff, psychology staff) for additional information on the identified concerns. Interviews with staff are not done routinely. If during observations the surveyor(s) determine that the current objectives of the IPP match the strengths and needs of the client, the staff is familiar with the methodology of accomplishing these programs, and they are being carried out as wri tten in the IPP, there is no need to conduct formal staff interviews. The surveyor should ask the staff (direct care staff carrying out the program(s)) for records documenting program(s). Generally, the client should be making steady progress and this should be reflected in the program data. However, if there is no progress made or if there has been a regression, there should be evidence that the QIDP/ID team is aware of the issue and is addressing it. In this case or in the case where actual programs do not match IPP programs or do not seem appropriate for the client based upon the client's identified skills, it will be necessary for the surveyors to interview appropriate staff. 2. Staff Generally, an inadequate number of staff will result in concerns with client programming and client protection. During observations, note how the on duty staffing ratios either promote or prevent a safe and productive active treatment environment. In some instances surveyors will see the effects of inadequate staffing early (during the first impression observation). These effects may include chaotic environment, client -to-client abuse, self -abuse by clients, clients sitting unengaged for long periods of time with little or no staff presence, clients not given the opportunity to assist in ADLs or participate in the rhythms of life due to the need to \"get things done\" (such as assisting with mal preparation), or programs not being carried out due to inadequate on- duty staffing. 3. Qualified Intellectual Disabilities Professional (QIDP) The increased time devoted to observations during the survey provides more of an opportunity to also observe the QIDP in action. Observe interactions between the QIDP and the staff and the QIDP and the clients. Is the QIDP familiar with client programs and client progress? How much direct interaction is occurring among the QIDP, the staff and the clients? Is the QIDP intervening when necessary and facilitating revisions to IPP as indicated? If the surveyor has unresolved discrepancies, any concerns should be discussed with the QIDP. 4. Health Care Services The surveyor should determine from observations whether or not the sampled clients are receiving medical care as indicated. NOTE: a. Do any of the clients have acute or chronic medical issues? How are these issues being addressed by the medical staff at the facility? b. Do the clients seem alert and energetic? c. Are clients at a healthy weight? d. Do the clients have good oral health? Have any dental problems been dealt with promptly and appropriately? e. Are the staff trained on first aid and reporting of medical issues? If during observation there is concern about the health of a client, the nurse surveyor should talk with the client and/or the nurse about the issues observed. In the event that there is not a nurse surveyor, the non- clinical surveyor will need to consult with a clinician at the SA. Determine what interaction is occurring between the client and the medical staff and whether the situation is improving or deteriorating? Review the pertinent portions of the client record and discuss with the medical staff as necessary. If there are clients on a self -administration of medications program, the evaluation of the program should be part of the active treatment observations. 5. Physical Environment During observations, the surveyor should observe the facility for cleanliness, comfortable temperature and any safety hazards (i.e. obstructed walkways, resilient, nonabrasive, and slip- resistant floors). Client Record Review: Review of the client record durin g the focused fundamental survey is kept to a minimum. No routine record review is done. All record reviews are focused on obtaining additional information to clarify or completely document areas of question or concern identified during observation. VII - Task Four - Required Interviews with Individuals and/or Family/Advocate Direct Care Staff Purpose Individuals living in the facility, their families/guardians and advocates, and direct care staff are important sources of information about the receipt of active treatment on a daily basis. Interviews are conducted for two purposes: to determine how the individual perceives the services delivered by the facility, and t o clarify information gathered during observations. B - Interview Procedure Start with the individual in the sample and the people most closely associated with the individual's daily program implementation. Use the following hierarchy of sources, to the maximum extent possible, in the order shown: \u0000 Individual; \u0000 Families, legal guardian, or advocate; care staff; \u0000 Qualified intellectual disabilities professional (QIDP) and/or professional staff; and \u0000 Managers, administrators, or department heads . Determine from your observations and from the staff how the individual communicates with others. Also determine from the staff the extent of involvement of family members, guardians or advocates with the individuals in the sample. Based on this information, select the individuals from the sample with whom you will conduct more in- depth interviews. Select those individuals who will be able to communicate at least some basic information or those who have actively involved family members, guardians or a dvocates. Do not exclude from interviews individuals who use alternate means of communication, such as communication boards, sign language, and gestures. Most individuals are able to communicate in some manner. Attempt to obtain the required number of interviews first from individuals and then from family members, guardians or advocates. In the absence of individuals who are able to communicate and active significant others, interview the direct care staff person who works most closely with the individual in order to obtain the required number of in- depth interviews. The questions and communication method will vary from person to person. For individuals who use a specialized communication method, attempt to begin the interview on a one to one basis. If you find you are unable to communicate with the individual, ask someone familiar with the person to assist you (e.g., a family member or a staff person.) For this individual, pay close attention to how the staff communicates with him or her. If the person use s sign language or a communication board, does staff understand and interact with the individual using the same method? If the person uses gestures, does staff take time to determine his or her needs? Family members, guardians or advocates may be intervie wed at the facility, at a location convenient to both the surveyor and the interviewee, or by telephone. All interviews should be conducted in private locations and scheduled at mutually agreed upon times in order to minimize disruptions to individual, fam ily, or staff activities. C - Content of In -depth Interviews Determine what the facility does to provide individualized services and supports; and how individuals and families participate in service planning and in making choices about matters important to them. \u0000 Are individuals treated with respect and dignity? \u0000 Does the facility attempt to help the person set and attain individual goals? \u0000 Are there consistent opportunities for making choices? \u0000 When a choice is not an option, how is the individual assisted to understand? \u0000 For example, if a planned activity is to go to a restaurant for dinner, who chooses the restaurant? \u0000 Is it staff or the individuals living in the facility? \u0000 If one group of people does not want to go, how is this choice accommodated? \u0000 Is the accommodation based on individual choice, staff convenience, or a reasonable justification if a choice is not an option? See section D for suggested interview questions. Unless designated that certain questions be directed to a certain person, questions a re relevant to whoever is being interviewed (individual, family member, advocate or staff person.) Modify the wording of the questions based on the person being interviewed (individual, family member, or staff) and on the communication skills of that individual. For example, you may discover that the person responds better to questions that can be answered \"yes\" or \"no\" than to open- ended questions. Be sensitive to signs that the individual is tiring or becoming uncomfortable and either end the interview or continue it at a later time if this occurs. It is not necessary to ask every question in the guide, but do try to ask at least one question from each topic area. D - Suggested Interview Questions If you have not met the person before, begin the intervie w by explaining who you are and what your role is. To put the person at ease you may want to begin with some general conversation, e.g., about the weather or a special event coming up. At the end of the interview, if you think you may need to discuss or c onfirm personal information with staff or family, ask the person if it is OK to share that information. Questions Related to Choice and Community Participation ( W136, W147, W247): \u0000 What sorts of things do you like to do for fun? \u0000 Do you go out to activitie s or events in the community (like shopping, movies or church)? \u0000 How often do you do this? \u0000 How do you get there? \u0000 Who chooses where you go? \u0000 Do you go to visit family members or take vacations? \u0000 Is there something you would like to do more often? Questions Related to Personal Finances and Possessions ( W126, W137): \u0000 Do you earn money on your job (at your day program)? \u0000 What do you like to buy with your money? \u0000 Do you have enough money to buy the things you want or need? \u0000 Does someone help you with spending or sa ving your money? \u0000 When you go to the store, do you pay for items or does a staff person pay for them? \u0000 Do you have enough clothes and shoes? \u0000 Do you always have enough deodorant and toothpaste, etc.? \u0000 What do you do if you need to buy something? Questions Related to Personal Relationships and Privacy ( W129- W130, W133, W143 - W148): \u0000 family or friends who visit you? \u0000 Does your family write to you or telephone you? \u0000 Does someone help you read their letters/ call them on the phone? \u0000 If you feel like being alone or spending private time with a friend or family where do you go? \u0000 Does staff knock on your door before they come into the room? For family member/advocate: \u0000 How do you learn about things like the services your family member receives, an illness or a change in medication? \u0000 Are there any restrictions on when you visit your family member or where you can go within the home? Questions Related to Individual's and Family's Participation in the IPP Process ( W209, W247): \u0000 Do you go to (team) meetings with the staff where they talk about the services you get? \u0000 Does your family/advocate come to these meetings? \u0000 Were you asked if the date and time of the meeting were OK with you? \u0000 What would you like to learn to do for yourself? \u0000 Does the staff ask you what y ou want? \u0000 Who chooses what you do? \u0000 Does the staff listen to you and make changes based on what you want? For staff: \u0000 How do you communicate with this individual? \u0000 What does (s) he like and dislike? How do you know that? Questions Related to Service Delivery ( W242, W249, W436): \u0000 What help do you need from staff to dress, eat, bathe, etc? \u0000 Do you get any special therapy (e.g., speech or physical therapy)? \u0000 What new things are you learning to do? \u0000 What chores do you help with around the house? \u0000 Who helps you when you do not know how to do something? \u0000 What special equipment do you use? Questions Who do you tell if you do not like something, or something is wrong? \u0000 Are there rules that everyone who lives here must follow? \u0000 What sorts of things are you allowed to do or not do? \u0000 How does the staff treat you? \u0000 Are staff loud? \u0000 Does staff yell, swear or hit? \u0000 Do you ever do things you are not supposed to do? What happens then? \u0000 Were you ever asked to give consent for any treatments or services? \u0000 Were you told the benefits, risks and alternatives? Questions Related to Health Status ( W322, W356): \u0000 How often do you see a doctor? A dentist? \u0000 Do you have any health problems? \u0000 Do you take any medicines? Do you know what they are for? Wrap -up Questions: \u0000 Is there anything you especially like about living here? Anything you especially dislike? \u0000 Is there anything else you think I should know about what it is like to live here? E - Inte rviews to Clarify Observations In the absence of finding appropriate interaction between staff and individuals during observations, it may be necessary to judge whether or not staff is knowledgeable about individual objectives and techniques for implementa tion of programs. If possible, interview staff following the interval in which the individual was observed with the particular staff member. (For example, if you have just observed Individual A engaging in stereotypical behaviors, ask: \"Can you tell me wha t, if anything, you do when he rocks back and forth?\") Ask questions that elicit information about how staff learns what to do with individuals across the spectrum of support and programming activities they are expected to perform. Ask professional staff questions to see if they know how to implement programs for an individual other than their professional discipline (e.g., how to carry through with a behavior program in the midst of communications training). Ascertain whether the staff is competent to car ry out the individual's choices and skill development activity. Is there evidence that programs are in fact being carried out throughout the individual's waking hours? Are interventions revised based on changes in the individual's progress toward goals? If staff cannot demonstrate the skills necessary to implement the individual's programs and choices, if interventions are not being carried out consistently, or if revisions to interventions do not occur, you have findings that active treatment is not being delivered. F - Documentation Record each interview you conduct with individuals, staff, consultants, off -site day program staff, legal guardians, etc., in your personal notes or on the optional observation worksheet (Form CMS - 3070I ). Include the following information in your notes for each interview: \u0000 Date and time of interview; \u0000 Job title and assignment at the ICF/IID; \u0000 Relationship to the individual or reason for the interview; and \u0000 Summary of the information obtained. VIII - Task Five - Drug Pass Observation the preparation and administration of medications to individuals. With this approach, there is no doubt that the errors detected, if any, are errors in drug administration, not documentation. Follow the procedure in the interpretive guidelines at W 369 for conducting the drug pass observation. Notes on observations of the drug pass may be recorded on Form CMS - 677 (LTC Medication Pass Worksheet) or in the surveyor's personal notes. The purpose of the review is to direct the facility's attention to assuring an error free drug distribution system and away from the paper processes that often do not represent actual errors in medication administration. For the purposes of this task, a \"small\" facility is one that houses 16 or fewer residents. IX - Task Six - Visit to Each Area of Facility Serving Certified Individuals (Rev. - Purpose By the end of the survey, visit each area of the facility serving certified individuals in order to: \u0000 Ensure that all areas of the facility (including those that are not represented by individuals in the sample) are providing services in the manner required by the regulations. \u0000 Assess generally the physical safety of the environment. \u0000 Assess that individual rights are proactively asserted and protected. B - Protocol After individuals in the sample have been assigned to team members, review the facility's map or building layout. Assign members to visit each remaining residential and on -campus day program site prior to completing the survey. Insure that each area of the facility that is utilized by individuals has been visited. This vi sit may be done with or without facility staff accompanying you, as you prefer, and subject to their availability. Record your observations in your notes. Converse with individuals, family members/significant others (if present), and staff. Ask open- ende d questions in order to confirm observations, obtain additional information, or corroborate information, e.g., accidents, odors, apparent inappropriate dress, adequacy and appropriateness of training activities. Observe staff interactions with other staff members as well as with individuals for insight into matters such as individual rights and staff responsibilities. X - Task Seven - Record Review of Individuals in the Sample (Rev. - Introduction Do not spend an excessive amount of time looking at fine details in the record review of the selected sample. The purposes are to: Verify the applicable information obtained from your observations and interviews; Review revisi ons that have been made to the objectives; and Verify that needed health and safety supports are in place. Do not review in detail the written training programs that are developed for each individual unless you discover serious differences between the record and your observations and interviews. Review those parts of the record most relevant to your purposes as described below. B - The Individual Program Plan (IPP) Identify the developmental, behavioral, and health objectives the facility has committed itself to accomplish during the current IPP period. Identify what, if any, behavioral strategies (e.g., behavior modification programs, use of psychotropics) are being used with individuals in your sample. Determine what, if any, health or other problems might interfere with participation in program services. C - Program Monitoring and Change Skim the most recent interdisciplinary team review notes to identify what rev isions were made to the IPP. Determine whether revisions were based on objective measures of the individual's progress, regression, or lack of progress toward his/her objectives. D - Health and Safety Supports Verify, either through the interdisciplinary team review notes or through the most recent nursing notes, that the individual has received follow -up services for any health or dental needs identified in the IPP and check the person's current drug regimen. For individuals with whom restrictive or intru sive techniques are used, verify that the necessary consents and approvals have been obtained. If this information is consistent with your observations and interviews, conclude the record review. If discrepancies are found, conduct further observations or interviews as needed to verify your findings. XI - Exit Conference pre -exit conference, the survey team records on the Form CMS -3070H (\"Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities Deficiencies Report\") those requirements that are determined to be deficient and the findings that support that determination. Write the deficiency statement in terms specific enough to allow a reasonably knowledgeable person to understand the aspect(s) of the requirement(s) that is (are) not met. Indicate on the Form CMS- 3070H the data prefix tag, followed by a summary of the deficient facility practice(s). Briefly identify the supporting findings for each deficiency (i.e., transfer to the Form CMS- 3070H the identifier numbers of all clients to whom the deficient practice applies.) It is not necessary to write a full description of the findings on the Form CMS- 3070H since they will be described in more detail on the completed Statement of Deficiencies (Form CMS- 2567). It is necessary to complete the Form CMS -3070H for each survey because the Form CMS -3070H is the only document in which the survey team's recommendations for deficiencies are recorded (which may be changed later on the final Form CMS- 2567 as a result of supervisory review) and because not all client examples may be used on the Form CMS -2567. During the exit conference, provide the facility administrator with all regulations determined to not be met during the survey. Provide examples as necessary, allow the facility to provide addi tional information if it chooses, inform the facility that the findings are preliminary and final compliance determinations will be made by the survey office. Part II - Interpretive Guidelines -Responsibilities of Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities \u00a7440.150 Intermediate Care Facility Services, Other Than in Institutions for Mental Diseases W101 (Rev. 135, \u00a7483.410(e) . Section 442.251, the standard which requires that facilities meet the requirement for a State license, is redesignated to \u00a7483. 410(e) and W101 is reassigned as well to afford a sense of continuity. W102 (Rev. 135, Governing body and management (a) Governing body -27-15) \u00a7483.410(a) The facility must identify an individual or individuals to constitute the governing body of the facility. Guidance \u00a7483.410(a) If concerns are noted regarding the governing body, written documentation verifies that the facility has designated the individual or individuals to constitute the governing body and their titles. W104 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.410(a)( 1) The governing body must exercise general policy, budget, and operating direction over the facility. Guidance \u00a7483.410(a)(1) The governing body develops, monitors, and revises, as necessary, policies and operating directions which ensure the necessary staffing, training resources, equipment and environment to provide clients with active treatment and to provide for their health and safety. Direction by the Governing Body includes areas such as health, safety, sanitation, maintenance and repair, and uti lization and management of staff. Condition level operational deficiencies may be associated with a failure by the Governing Body to exercise general direction of the facility. W105 (Rev. \u00a7483.410(a)(2) The governing body must set the qualifications (in addition to those already set by State law, if any) for the administrator of the facility. Guidance \u00a7483.410(a)(2) The policies of the facility must include the qualifications o f the administrator, and the qualifications are stated in the job description of the administrator. W106 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.410(a)(3) The governing body must appoint the administrator of the f acility. Guidance \u00a7483.410(a)(3) This appointment must be in writing. (b) Standard: Compliance with Federal, State and local laws \u00a7483.410(b) The facility must be in compliance with all applicable provisions of Federal, State and local laws, regulations and codes pertaining to: Guidance \u00a7483.410(b) The facility has no final adverse action by a Federal, State, or local authority. Such adverse actions include, but are not limited to fines, limitation on services that may be provided, or loss of licensure . The facility must be able to provide for review, current licenses and permits as well as applicable reports of inspections by State or local health authorities. If a situation is identified indicating the provider may not be in compliance with Federal, State, or local law, refer that information to the authority having jurisdiction (AHJ) for follow -up actions. See W107, Guidance \u00a7483.410(b) Reference the specific law, regulation, or code not met. W108 (Rev. 135, and Guidance \u00a7483.410(b) Reference the specific law, regulation, or code not met. W109 (Rev. 135, Guidance \u00a7483.410(b) Reference the specific law, regulation, or code not met. (c) Standard: Client Records (Rev. -27-15) \u00a7483.410(c)(1) The facility must develop and maintain a record keeping system that includes a separate record for each client and; W111 (Rev. documents the client's health care, active treatment, social information, and protection of the client's rights. Guidance \u00a7483.410(c)(1) The structure and c ontent of a client's record must be an accurate, functional representation of the actual experience of the client in the facility. The record should contain an accurate account of all information relevant to the client's health care, active treatment, social information and protection of the client's rights, such as communications, correspondence, program plans (to include both in -house and outside service programs), progress summaries, activity plans and activity participation, incidents, consent form s and all medical information. If the records are maintained electronically, the facility staff should be able to access various parts of the record without difficulty. If they are unable to access components of the record upon request, then this may ind icate a lack of training by the facility. W112 (Rev. -27-15) \u00a7483.410(c)(2) The facility must keep confidential all information contained in the clients' records, regardless of the form or sto rage method of the records. Guidance \u00a7483.410(c)(2) \"Keep confidential\" means safeguarding the content of information including video, audio, and/or computer stored information from unauthorized disclosure without the specific informed consent of the cli ent, parent of a minor child, or legal guardian, and consistent with the advocate's right of access. Facility staff and consultants, hired to provide services to the client, sign confidentiality agreements before having access to client records and should have access to only that portion of information that is necessary to provide effective responsive services to the client. These agreements should be renewed according to the policies of the facility. The agreement may stipulate that the agreements are in place until either the facility or member terminates the agreement. The facility has in place safeguards to ensure that access to all information regarding clients is limited to those clients designated by Health Insurance Portability and Accountabilit y Act (HIPAA) requirements, the Developmental Disabilities Act, State law and facility policy. The facility should prevent any instances of unauthorized access or dissemination. For example, the staff is observed to leave the client record (hard copy or electronic version) in the living room of the house when visitors or persons not authorized to access client records are present. Client records must be secured when staff is not present. The facility must develop and follow procedures for maintaining th e confidentiality of client information during transport to medical appointments or to other locations outside the facility. Confidentiality applies to both central records and information kept at dispersed locations. If there is information considered t oo confidential to place in the record used by all staff (e.g., identification of the family's financial assets, sensitive medical data), it may be retained in a companion record located in a secure location in the facility with a notation made in the prim ary record as to the location of confidential information. The facility must ensure that any client information provided to day services programs is maintained confidential. The sharing of client specific information with members of the \"specially constituted committee\" required by \u00a7483.440(f)(3), who are not affiliated with the agency, does not violate a client's right to have information about him or her kept confidential. The committee must have relevant information to function properly. Facility con fidentiality safeguards include the development and implementation of written policies to assure that members of the specially constituted team maintain confidentiality. Such processes may include signed confidentiality agreements. These agreements shou ld be renewed according to the policies of the facility. The agreement may stipulate that the agreements are in place until either the facility or member terminates the agreement. W113 \u00a7483.410(c)(3) The facility must develop and implement policies and procedures governing the release of any client information, including consents necessary from the client, or parents (if the client is a minor) or legal guardian. Guidance \u00a7483 .410(c)(3) The facility develops and follows written policies governing the release of client information. Release of any personally identifiable information does not occur unless consent(s) is obtained prior to the release. These policies must address at a minimum who must give consent for the release of information from records. The policy and procedures should account for other situations involving the release of client information, such as: who should be notified when records have been released; procedures to be followed with subpoenas; time frames for providing requested information; and information regarding a client's HIV status may not be released without specific consent and may not be in the record if that consent has not been given. W114 (Rev. 135, -27-15) individual who makes an entry in a client's record must make it legibly, date it, and sign it. Guidance \u00a7483.410(c)(4) Illegible writing in hard copy records can contribute to communication deficits among staff. Illegible writing which cannot be easily interpreted by facility staff upon surveyor request may constitute a safety issue. Electronic signatures are acceptable in the electronic record system. W115 \u00a7483.410(c)(5) The facility must provide a legend to explain any symbol or abbreviation used in a client's record. W116 (Rev. -27-15) \u00a7483.410(c)(6) The facility must provide each identified residential living unit with appropriate aspects of each client's record. Guidance \u00a7483.410(c)(6) \"Appropriate\" means those parts of each client's record are most likely (or known) to be needed by the residential staff to carry out the client's active tr eatment program in the unit; to alert staff to health risks and other aspects of medical treatment; to support the psychosocial needs of the client; to contact family or emergency contacts, and to provide anything else necessary to the staff's ability to w ork on behalf of the client. The staff of the residential living unit has, and can access, all information which is relevant to implementing client program plans, appropriate care of, interaction with, and provision of services for the client. (d) Standa rd: Services provided under agreements with outside sources a service required under this subpart is not provided directly, the facility must have a written agreement with an outside program, resource, or service to furnish the necessary service, including emergency and other health care. Guidance \u00a7483.410(d)(1) If a service is not provided directly, there must be a written agreement for such service s. Written agreements are required for emergency services such as dentists and pharmacies. For those services that require a visit to a hospital, the Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (ICF/IID) typically utilizes services from an emergency department of the hospital, thus no written contract is required. Federal statute (P.L. 94 -142) requires all school- aged children to receive a free and appropriate school education. Therefore, a written agreement between ICF/II Ds and public schools is not necessary. W118 (d)(2)(i) Contain the responsibilities, functions, objectives, and other terms agreed to by both parties; and W119 (Rev. -27-15) \u00a7483.410(d)(2)(ii) Provide that the facility is responsible for assuring that the outside services meet the standards for quality of services contained in this subpart. W120 (Rev. The facility must assure that outside services meet the needs of each client. Guidance \u00a7483.410(d)(3) Outside services are any services needed by the clients and not provided directly by the facility (hospital visits, dental visits, day program services, etc.). Programs and services must be coordinated between the facility and the outside service, and foster consistency of implementation across settings of teaching strategies and behavior management. The facility monitors outside services on an ongoing basis to ensure that services provided are consistent with the needs of each client as identified in the Individual Program Plan (IPP). For example, if the facility is implementing a behavior management or a communication program for the client, it is shared with the outside program and implemented by the outside program (workshop, day program, etc.) and the outside program agrees to incorporate it into their day program. At periodic intervals, the facility staff visit or communicate with the ou tside program to verify consistency across the two settings. With outside resources, it is the responsibility of the facility to assure that the services are provided in a safe clean environment, by appropriately qualified professions, and any untoward outcome of services are promptly addressed. If, in spite of attempts by the facility to assure compliance, the outside program does not implement the program for the client, then the facility remains responsible for the lack of active treatment. W121 (Rev. 135, Issued: 02 -27-15, Effective: 04 -27-15, Implementation: 04 -27-15) \u00a7483.410(d)(4) If living quarters are not provided in a facility owned by the ICF/IID, the ICF/IID remains directly responsible for the standards relating to physical environment tha t are specified in \u00a7483.470(a) through (g), (j) and (k). Guidance \u00a7483.410(d)(4) Even though the facility's premises may be rented from a landlord, the facility must ensure that the requirements for physical environment are met, either through arrangemen t with the landlord or through the facility's own services. (e) Standard: Licensure \u00a7483.420(a) Standard: Protection of Clients ' Rights The facility must ensure the rights of all clients. Therefore, the facility must Guidelines \u00a7483.420(a) \"Ensure\" means that the facility actively asserts the individual's rights and does not wait for him or her to claim a right. This obligation exists even when the individual is less than fully competent and requires that the facility is actively engaged in activities which result in the pro - active assertion of the individual's rights, e.g., guardianship, advocacy, training programs, use of specially constituted committee, etc. \u00a7483.410(e) Standard: -27-15) \u00a7483.410(e) The facility must be licensed under applicable State and local law. Guidance \u00a7483.410(e) The facility has a current, valid State license when required under State law. W122 (Rev. 135, Issued: protections (a) Standard: Protection of clients' rights \u00a7483.420(a) The facility must ensure the rights of all clients. Therefore the facility must Guidance \u00a7483.420(a) The facility must ensure the client's rights and does not wait for him or her to claim a right. This obligation exists even when the client is less than fully competent and requires that the facility is actively engaged in activities which result in the protection of the client's rights, advocacy for individual clients who have no family or an inactive family, and training programs for clients and staff on the understanding and protection of client rights. W123 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.420(a)(1) Inform each client, parent (if the client is a minor), or legal guardian, of the client's rights and the rules of the facility; Guidance \u00a7483.420(a)(1) The obligation to inform requires that the facility presents information on rights to the client, his or her family or his or her legal guardian in a manner and form which they can understand. In most instances, family means parent. However, in those instances where parents are deceased or ch oose not to be active in the client's life and there is another family member who does wish to be active, but is not the legal guardian, this family member should be informed of the client's rights. Printed materials should be provided in understandable t erms and provided in the language necessary to ensure understanding. Specialized methods, as indicated, should be provided for communication with clients, families or legal guardians with hearing or vision impairment. Pro-active assertion of client right s includes, but is not limited to: Signed evidence that the client, his or her family and/or his or her legal guardian have been informed of the client's rights, and Evidence that the communication of these rights were provided at the client's level of comprehension, and in the language understandable to the client. The obligation to inform also requires that the facility make some determination of whether the client and his or her family, or legal guardian understood the rights presented and made additi onal efforts to communicate the rights if the rights were not understood. If the facility has written \"rules of the facility\", these rules must be communicated to the client, their family and or legal guardians at the time of admission and must not be in conflict with any of the rights listed in 42 CFR 483.420 (a) (1 -13). -27-15) \u00a7483.420(a)(2) Inform each client, parent (if the client is a minor), or legal guardian, of the client's medical condition, developmental and behavioral status, attendant risks of treatment, and of the right to refuse treatment; Guidance \u00a7483.420(a)(2) Clients, their families or legal guardians are promptly informed of any change in the client's medical or behavioral needs that requires immediate alteration to programmatic or medical intervention. Promptly is defined by the level of severity of the alteration. In each case, they must also be informed of the attendant risks of any recommended treatments or interventions and of their right to refuse treatment, training or services. If parents or legal guardians wish for other members of the client's family to be informed of such changes, they must put this permission in writing. The communication of this in formation must be provided in the manner and language understood by the client or their family or legal guardian (language boards, sign language, etc.). The term \"attendant risks of treatment\" describes the risk vs. risk and risk vs. benefit associated with the treatment. These risks include possible side effects, other complications from treatments including medical and drug therapy, unintended consequences of treatment, other behavioral or psychological ramifications arising from treatment, etc. The fac ility actively attempts to engage clients who refuse to participate in active treatment. While the regulation recognizes the client's right to refuse treatment, persistent refusal that impacts the health and safety of the client and/or others, or the ability to provide overall active treatment, may result in facility's consideration of alternative placements for the client. It is expected, however, that the facility has assessed the reason for refusal, and developed and implemented all possible interventions to engage the client in active treatment programs prior to referring the client to another therapeutic setting. A client, his or her family member, or legal guardian who refuses a particular treatment (e.g., a behavior control, seizure control medicat ion or a particular intervention strategy) must be offered information about acceptable alternatives to the treatment, if acceptable alternatives are available. The client's preference about alternatives should be elicited and considered in deciding on th e course of treatment. If the client, family member, or legal guardian also refuses the alternative treatment, or if no alternative exists to the treatment refused, the facility must consider the effect this refusal may have on other clients, the client h imself or herself, and if they can continue to provide services to the client consistent with these regulations. If the facility is unable to provide services to a client due to consistent refusal to participate, they must weigh all options including an i nvoluntary discharge. Involuntary discharge must be for good cause (see 483.440(b)(4)(i)). When a client is considered for participation in experimental research the client, his/her family and/or legal guardian must be fully informed of the nature of the experiment (e.g., what medications or physical interventions will be utilized, the length of the research, any possible side effects and how the information from the research will be utilized). Information regarding the possible consequences of participa ting or not participating must be provided to the client, family member or legal guardian. The written consent of the client, his/her family or legal guardian must be received prior to participation. For a client who is a minor or who has been adjudicate d as incompetent, the written informed consent of the parents of the minor or the legal guardian is required. The signed, informed consent documentation must be in compliance with HHS Guidelines for Research Involving Human Subjects. The signed consent m ust also include a clear discussion of what treatments will be included in the research, the time limits for the research and should clearly inform the client, family member or legal guardian that the client may end participation at any time without fear o f recrimination. If the research protocol indicates that clients receive compensation, then clients are compensated per the protocol. Any research must be reviewed and approved by the Specially Constituted Committee. See W263. W125 (Rev. -27-15) \u00a7483.420(a)(3) Allow and encourage individual clients to exercise their rights as clients of the facility, and as citizens of the United States, including the right to file complaints, and the right to due process; Guidance \u00a7483.420(a)(3) To the extent that a client is able, choices are made on his/her own. Each client has autonomy of decision making and choice. They are free to move about without limitations imposed due to staff preferences or s taff convenience. Clients are not restricted without due cause or due process. To the extent that the client is able to make decisions for him or herself, it is inappropriate to delegate the person's right to others (e.g. parents, family members, etc.). The facility has an obligation to assure client health and safety and must balance that obligation with the rights of clients. If the facility has implemented a restriction, the following should be in place: An assessment supporting the need for the re striction; An individualized behavior plan to reduce the need for the restriction has been developed and implemented; A written informed consent for the behavior plan which includes the restriction; Approval of the Specially Constituted Committee; and Monitoring by the Committee of the progress of the training program, designed to reduce and eventually eliminate the restriction. Clients, families, and legal guardians have the right to register a complaint with the facility and the State Survey Agency. If so, the facility must respond promptly and appropriately. The facility must ensure protection of the client from any form of reprisal or intimidation as a result of a complaint or grievance reported by the client, family, or legal guardian. Issues i nvolving the exercise of constitutional rights such as voting should be addressed as a component of the IPP when the Interdisciplinary Team (IDT) determines a need for training. Clients who have been adjudged to need guardianship or have been assessed as needing assistance to advocate for themselves should receive assistance or support so they may exercise their rights as citizens of the United States. W126 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.420(a)(4) Allow individual clients to manage their financial affairs and teach them to do so to the extent of their capabilities; Guidance \u00a7483.420(a)(4) The regulation is clear that in those cases where a client already possesses the skills necessary to independently ma nage their own financial affairs, the facility will allow the client to continue to do so. Formal training in financial management must be provided for all other clients in the facility to the extent of their capabilities. The regulation places the respo nsibility for determining the extent of the client's capabilities in this matter upon an assessment and interdisciplinary process within the facility. To reach a determination as to whether a money management program is appropriate, the facility IDT uses the comprehensive functional assessment (CFA) to evaluate the ability of each client to participate in such a program. Under 42 C.F.R. 483.440(c)(3), the team evaluation must establish, through documentation, that the IDT considers all of the objective da ta within the assessment in reaching their determination, especially the identification of client skills which can be used across training programs. Examples of assessment findings that may be considered by the IDT include skills that can be cross -utilize d in training programs such as: 1. Fine motor coordination; 2. The ability to make choices; 3. The ability to identify preferences; and 4. Cognitive abilities including tracking, attention span, communication, and the client's ability to understand the cause and effect. (The client understands of cause and effect is significant in the determination.) Money management includes a broad spectrum of programs with varying levels of participation by the client ranging from the use of choice in money expenditures, to a n understanding of the concept of money, and ultimately to actual money handling and budgeting. The IDT must not conclude that a money management program is inappropriate based solely upon the level of intellectual or physical disability of the client. The CFA must be reviewed at least annually per 42 C.F.R.483.440(f)(2). As a part of this annual review, a client's ability to participate in money management will also be reviewed. The annual review should always include an update to the CFA and take into consideration any changes in the client's circumstances since the last IPP. The need for a formal money management program must be addressed in every client's IPP by the IDT on an annual basis. The determination of the appropriateness of a formal money management program is made by the IDT and must be based upon a CFA. The IDT discussions resulting in that determination must be established through documentation in the client's IPP. W127 \u00a7483.420(a)(5) Ensure that clients are not subjected to physical, verbal, sexual or psychological abuse or punishment; Guidance \u00a7483.420(a)(5) Identification of patterns or isolated instances of physical, verbal, sexual or psychological abuse or punishment without prompt identification and corrective action by the facility would result in a non -compliance determination for this Standard and Condition level non -compliance. The facility must develop and implement systems that protect clients fro m all forms of abuse, neglect, or mistreatment, including client to client abuse, neglect, or mistreatment. a. The facility is expected to ensure that staff possess and demonstrate needed competencies to effectively and appropriately interact with clients. b. The facility must monitor to assure that systems are effectively implemented and the facility takes immediate actions to address circumstances where abuse, neglect, or mistreatment have occurred and prevent reoccurrence. c. The facility must be organized in such a manner as to proactively assure clients are free from any threat to their physical and psychological health and safety. d. The facility must act to prevent physical, verbal, sexual or psychological abuse. If the facility fails to implement appropriat e corrective action, the potential of additional threats to the clients remain at the facility. \"Threat\", for the purposes of this guideline, is considered any condition/situation which could cause or result in severe, temporary or permanent injury or harm to the mental or physical condition of clients, or in their death. \"Abuse\", for the purposes of this guideline, is the willful infliction of injury, unreasonable confinement, intimidation or punishment with the resulting physical harm, pain or personal anguish. Physical abuse refers to any action intended to cause physical harm or pain, trauma or bodily harm (e.g., hitting, slapping, punching, kicking, pinching, etc.). It includes the use of corporal punishment as well as the use of any restrictive, i ntrusive procedure to control inappropriate behavior for purposes of punishment. Verbal abuse refers to any use of insulting, demeaning, disrespectful, oral, written or gestured language directed towards and in the presence of the client. Psychological abuse includes, but is not limited to, humiliation, harassment, and threats of punishment or deprivation, sexual coercion and intimidation (e.g. living in fear in one's own home). Since many clients residing in ICF/IIDs are unable to communicate feelings of fear, humiliation, etc. associated with abusive episodes, the assumption is made that any actions that would usually be viewed as psychologically or verbally abusive by a member of the general public, would also be viewed as abusive by the client residing in the ICF/IID, regardless of that client's perceived ability to comprehend the nature of the incident. Sexual abuse includes any incident where a client is coerced or manipulated to participate in any form of sexual activity for which the client did not give affirmative permission (or gave affirmative permission without the attendant understanding required to give permission) or sexual assault against a client who is unable to defend him/herself. The facility must implement, through policies, oversight and training, safeguards to ensure that clients are not subjected to abuse by anyone including, but not limited to, facility staff, consultants or volunteers, staff of other agencies serving the client, family members or legal guardians, friends, other clients, or the general public. The facility must take whatever action is necessary to protect the clients residing there. For example, if a facility is forced by court order or arbitration rulings to retain or reinstate an employee found to be abusive, th e facility must take measures to protect the clients of the facility (such as assigning the employee to an area where there is no contact with clients). W128 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.420(a)(6) Ensure that clients are free from unnecessary drugs and physical restraints and are provided active treatment to reduce dependency on drugs and physical restraints; Guidance \u00a7483.420(a)(6) The facility must implement an aggressive active treatment progra m, which includes appropriate replacement behaviors, to address the reduction/elimination of physical restraints and drugs to manage behaviors. For purposes of this Guideline drugs to manage behavior are \"unnecessary\" if there is evidence the drugs are be ing used: In excessive dose (duplicate therapy); For excessive duration; Not monitored adequately; Without adequate indications for its use; With adverse consequences which indicate the dose should be reduced or discontinued; or Any combination of the rea sons listed above. The long term use of a drug/physical restraint to manage behavior combined with one or more of the following may indicate unnecessary use: The client's developmental and/or behavioral needs are not being met and the appropriateness of less restrictive approaches to manage inappropriate behaviors should be questioned; Staff behavior may be prompting behaviors in clients which result in the chronic use of physical restraints and drugs to control behavior; Staff may have inadequate trainin g and/or experience to provide active treatment and employ preventive measures; Restraints applied for behaviors when less restrictive measures have not been tried or have been tried and found to be just as effective. W129 (Rev. 144, Issued: 08- 14-15, Effective: 08 -14-15, Implementation: 08 -14-15) \u00a7483.420(a)(7) Provide each client with the opportunity for personal privacy and Guidance \u00a7483.420(a)(7) The facility must provide areas within the living area in which the client can have time to be alone, when appropriate, and to have privacy (their conversations cannot be overheard) for personal interactions/activities. There should be a location where the client can meet privately with family and/or friends and a telephone available where he/she can hold private telephone conversations. Personal privacy for clients also includes the right to have certain personal information about them kept confidential. Staff should not discuss one client in front of others (clients, parents, legal guardians, visitors , etc.) and should not post personal information about clients in areas where other clients, families and the public can read the information. Video/audio taping or live feed must not be used in place of or for the convenience of staff. The facility may install video/audio equipment for purposes of observing client/staff interactions. Video/audio equipment may only be installed in common areas (in no case may videotaping or live feed be done in bathrooms or areas where private visits are conducted). The clients, families and/or legal guardians of the clients residing in the areas where videotaping or live feed will occur must give informed consent for the installation and must be assured that no personal privacy will be jeopardized. The use of the equip ment must be presented at and approved by the specially constituted committee for the facility prior to the installation of video or audio devices. Motion sensors should not be considered cameras. W130 (Rev. 135, Issued: 04 -27-15) ensure privacy during treatment and care of personal needs; Guidance \u00a7483.420(a)(7) Clients must be provided privacy during personal hygiene activities (e.g., toileting, bathing, dressing) and during medical/nursin g treatments that require exposure of one's body. People not involved in the care of the client should not be present without their consent while they are being examined or treated. Whenever possible, the facility should be sensitive to clients' preferences for same sex care in private situations. W131 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.420(a)(8) Ensure that clients are not compelled to perform services for the facility and Guidance \u00a7483.420(a)(8) Clients are not required or expected to be a source of labor for a facility. The client must not be required or expected to do productive work for the facility, other than appropriate care of one's own personal space or shared responsibilities for common areas. W132 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.420(a)(8) ensure that clients who do work for the facility are compensated for their efforts at prevailing wages and commensurate with their abilities; Guidance \u00a7483.420(a)(8) \"Work\", as used in the regulation, means any directed activity, or series of related activities which results in a benefit to the economy of the facility or in a contribution to its maintenance, or in the production of a salable product. In deciding whether a particular activity constitutes \"work\" as defined above, the key determinant is whether the facility would be required to hire additional full or part -time staff (or pay overtime to existing staff) to perform the service the client is a sked to perform. Clients volunteering to do real work that benefits the facility should give informed consent for such practices and understand that by providing employable services they are able to be compensated. This does not preclude a client from he lping out a friend or being kind to others. Self-care activities related to the care of one's own person or property are not considered \"work\" for purposes of compensation. In general, participation in any household task which promotes greater independen t functioning and assists the client to prepare for less restrictive setting (and which the client has not yet learned) is permitted as long as tasks are included in the IPP in written behavioral and measurable terms. This participation must be supervised , and indices of performance should be available. No task may be performed for the convenience of staff (e.g., supervising clients, running personal errands). \"Compensated\" means the client is provided with money or other forms of negotiable compensation for work (including work performed in an occupational training program) and such compensation is to be used at the client's discretion. Prevailing wage refers to the wage paid to non -disabled workers in nearby industry or the surrounding community for es sentially the same type, quality and quantity of work or work requiring comparable skills. A client who works in the facility must be paid at least the prevailing minimum wage, unless an appropriate certificate has been obtained by the facility in accordance with current regulations and guidelines issued under the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended. Any client performing \"work\", as defined above, must be compensated in direct proportion to his or her output. The facility should utilize Department of Labor and/or Department of Vocational Rehabilitation formulas and techniques for determining rate of pay. A client's pay is not dependent on the production of other clients when he or she works in a group. When the client's active treatment program includes assignment to occupational or vocational training or work, specific work objectives of anticipated progress should be included in the IPP along with reasons for the assignments. If the training of clients on particular occupational activities or functio ns involves \"real work\" to be accomplished for the facility, the clients must be compensated based on ability. For example, if in the process of work training activities which involve learning to clean a floor, the floor for a particular building is clean ed and does not require further janitorial cleanup, then the client must be compensated for this activity at the prevailing wage. W133 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.420(a)(9) Ensure clients the opportunity to communicate, associate and meet privately with individuals of their choice, Guidance \u00a7483.420(a)(9) Privacy must be provided for both face -to-face interactions and electronic interactions. The facility must provide opportunities for the c lient to communicate, through regular mail, telephone and/or electronic mail and meet in private with persons of their choice (e.g., friends from the community, family members, and advocates). There may be instances where legal guardians override the wish es of the client. In these instances, the facility should be actively working with the legal guardian and the client to reach the maximum agreeable level of interaction for the client. Space must be provided for clients to receive visitors in reasonable comfort and privacy. W134 (Rev. 135, send and receive unopened mail; Guidance \u00a7483.420(a)(9) Clients must be provided the opportunity to send/receive all types of mail unopened and read the contents themselves if able. If the staff has to open and read mail to the client, this should be done in a private place allowing the client as much participation as possible. Clients who have their own electronic equipment must be provided the opportunity to send, receive, and read electronic mail with privacy. W135 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.420(a)(10) Ensure that clients have access to telephones with privacy for incoming and outgoing local and long distance calls except as contraindicated by factors identified within their individual program plans; Guidance \u00a7483.420(a)(10) Any restriction of telephone access must be explained in the IPP with a plan to advance the client 's access. For persons with hearing loss who could benefit, Text Telephone (TTY) services or other accommodations should be provided. As with any other rights restriction, the restriction must be addressed in the IPP, written informed consent obtained, a nd the plan must be reviewed and approved by the specially constituted committee. W136 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.420(a)(11) Ensure clients the opportunity to participate in social, religious, and com munity group activities; Guidance \u00a7483.420(a)(11) Clients should be offered the opportunity to participate in various types of activities in the community (e.g., going to grocery stores, hair salons, restaurants, places of worship, pharmacies, community meetings and events) based on their interests and choices. The facility must make accommodations for physical issues such as hearing impairment and mobility limitations. In addition, clients should be taught the applicable skills to participate in their choice of activities to the fullest extent of their abilities. It is not acceptable for all client activities to be provided in the facility. When a client is identified to be on restriction from community integration opportunities, interview clients, families, legal guardians and staff to determine if due process was afforded for this restriction and whether the restriction is included in the IPP. In the event of a court placement that restricts community access, due process does not apply. There shoul d be evidence that the facility assists and encourages all clients, regardless of functioning levels, to have input into the decisions on community integration activities. It is not acceptable to require clients to attend unwanted activities due to staffing considerations. W137 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.420(a)(12) Ensure that clients have the right to retain and use appropriate personal possessions and clothing, and Guidance \u00a7483.420(a)(12) Clients should have personal possessions and clothing which meet their needs, interests and choices. Clients should have free access to their own possessions and clothing. When considering whether a client has free access to their personal possessions and cloth ing, ensure that physical limitations have been addressed. Clients who are unable to access and use personal possessions and clothing appropriately are involved in programs to learn the necessary skills to do so. In situations where the behavior of one o r more clients in a living area prevents free access to personal possessions for each client, the facility must develop IPPs for the client with disruptive behavior. The facility must also ensure that during the implementation of this program plan that no ne of the other clients have their rights infringed upon. Clients should not be without personal possessions because of the behavior of others with whom they live. All client possessions, regardless of their apparent value to others are treated with resp ect for what they may represent to the client. Where those choices include socially stigmatizing materials, the facility should provide learning opportunities to make more socially appropriate choices. The facility should encourage clients to use or disp lay possessions of his or her choice in a culturally normative manner. If a method for identifying personal effects is used, it should be inconspicuous and in a manner that will assist the client to identify them. \"Appropriate\" clothing means a supply of clothing that is sufficient, in good repair, accounts for a variety of occasions and seasons, and appropriate to age, size, gender, and level of activity. Modification or adaptation of clothing fasteners should be considered based on the needs of a clien t with a physical disability to become more independent. As appropriate, each client's active treatment program maximizes opportunities for choice and self- direction with regard to choosing and shopping for clothing which enhances his or her appearance, and selecting daily clothing in accordance with age, sex and cultural norms. Clients are permitted to keep personal clothing and possessions for their use while in the facility. Determine how the facility both ensures the safety of personal possessions wh ile at the same time providing client access to them when the client chooses. Clients are provided the opportunity, encouraged, and trained to use age -appropriate materials. The term \"age- appropriate\" refers to anything that reinforces recognition of the client as a person of a certain chronological age. Clients who choose to keep items traditionally used by children such as dolls or model cars are not an automatic citation. There must be evidence the facility is encouraging the client to use these posse ssions in a socially appropriate, non - stigmatizing manner. The facility's environment must be furnished with materials and activities that will enhance opportunities for growth. W138 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.420(a)(12) ensure that each client is dressed in his or her own clothing each day; and Guidance \u00a7483.420(a)(12) Clothing such as pajamas, underwear, socks, hats, mittens/gloves, and coats should be the personal property of the client and not c onsidered \"stock\" items. There should be no communal clothes. If clients are unable to do their own personal laundry the facility must ensure that clothing is properly laundered and returned to the appropriate client. The staff of the facility should en sure that clients dress appropriately for the season and the occasion by implementing training programs or guidance for the client as indicated. W139 \u00a7483.420(a)(13) Permit a husband and wife who both reside in the facility to share a room. \u00a7483.420(b) Standard: Client Finances (b)(1) The facility must establish and maintain a system that W140 (Rev. 135, full and complete accounting of clients' personal funds entrusted to the facility on behalf of clients; and Guidance \u00a7483.420(b)(1)(i) All purchases made using client personal funds must be itemized in the accounting record with the exception of pocket money. Pocket money given to the client does not need to be itemized. Pocket money should be considered a nominal amount of five dollars or less at a time. Funds provided by the facility and dispensed to a client as part of a program to train the client in money management, and funds that are not entrusted to the facility (e.g., funds paid directly to the client's representative payee) do not require accounting. In those instances where a legal guardian or the individual client is in control of their personal funds, no accounting is necessary by the facilit y. W141 (Rev. commingling of client funds with facility funds or with the funds of any person other than another client. Guidance \u00a7483.420(b)(1)(ii) If the facility elects to pool clients' funds in an interest -bearing account, including common trust accounts, it is expected to know the interest separately accrued by each client, as part of its required accounting of funds. Interest accumulated to a cl ient's account belongs to the client, not the facility. (Rev. 135, client's financial record must be available on request to the client, parents (if the client is a minor) or legal guardian. Guidance \u00a7483.420(b)(2) Those persons having legal authority to access the accounting records for personal funds such as the client, parent, or legal guardians should be afforded access upon request unless there is documented ra tionale for withholding the information. It is not necessary that a facility furnish an annual financial statement to the client, or the client's parent or legal guardian, since the facility is already required to make the financial record available at an y time upon request. The client, parent, and/or legal guardian, in turn, is free to choose to make the financial record available to anyone else. (c) Standard: Communication with clients, parents, and guardians. \u00a7483.420(c) The Facility must - W143 (Rev. 135, Effective: 04 -27-15, Implementation: 04 -27-15) \u00a7483.420(c)(1) Promote participation of parents (if the client is a minor) and legal guardians in the process of providing active treatment to a client unless their participation is unobtainable or inappropriate; Guidance \u00a7483.420(c)(1) The facility must maintain an on -going effort to communicate with parents, family members and/or legal guardians regarding the implementation of active treatment programs for the client. The facility encourages and engages parents, family members and legal guardians in the continued implementation of active treatment programs even while spending time outside of the facility setting. \"Unobtainable\", for the purposes of this guideline, means that t he facility has made a good faith effort to seek parental or legal guardian participation in the process, even though the effort may ultimately be unsuccessful (for example, the parent may be impossible to locate or may prove unwilling or unable to participate). \"Inappropriate\", for the purposes of this guideline, means that behavior of the parent or legal guardian could be disruptive or detrimental to the client's program outcome. In this case, determine what the facility has done to bring effective resolution to the problem. W144 (Rev. 135, clients' families and friends promptly and appropriately; Guidance \u00a7483.420(c)(2) It is reasonable to expect that the facility will provide at least an interim response to inquiries from the client's families and friends within 48 hours. W145 (Rev. by indi viduals with a relationship to the client (such as family, close friends, legal guardians and advocates) at any reasonable hour, without prior notice, consistent with the right of that client's and other clients' privacy, unless the interdisciplinary team determines that the visit would not be appropriate; Guidance \u00a7483.420(c)(3) Any limitations on visitors must be implemented as a result of IDT evaluation and discussion and be documented. This documentation should include evidence of approval from the s pecially constituted committee. Decisions to restrict a visitor for an individual client must be reviewed and re -evaluated each time the IPP is reviewed or at the client's request. Broad restrictions on visitors such as times of the day or certain days o f the week are a violation of this requirement. W146 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.420(c)(4) Promote visits by parents or guardians to any area of the facility that provides direct client care services to the client, consistent with the right of that client's and other clients' -27-15) \u00a7483.420(c)(5) Promote frequent and informal leaves from the facility for visits, trips , or vacations; and Guidance \u00a7483.420(c)(5) The facility should assist and encourage the client to communicate with their families or legal guardians concerning possible outside visits and vacations as frequently as possible. When the client does schedu le a trip or vacation, the facility must ensure that all necessary preparation is completed to facilitate the departure. The facility should not sponsor or allow clients to take a particular type of trip that would jeopardize their safety or health withou t consultation with parents/legal guardians and/or the IDT. promptly the client's parents or guardian of any significant incidents, or changes in the c lient's condition including, but not limited to, serious illness, accident, death, abuse, or unauthorized absence. Guidance \u00a7483.420(c)(6) \"Significant\" incidents or changes in the client's condition include serious injury, unusual seizure activity, hosp italization, serious illness, accident, death, allegations of abuse, neglect, or mistreatment, unauthorized absence, or any notifications the parent or legal guardian's requests. It is reasonable to expect the facility to contact the family or legal guard ian of a client as soon as possible after an incident occurs, but no later than 24 hours after the incident. If notification is done via electronic mail, the facility must request a response from the e -mail recipient to confirm notification. Telephone no tification must be accomplished by talking to the person directly. If a message is left, the facility must request a call back to confirm receipt of the notification. Contact by letter may be utilized as follow up confirmation, but not be the initial, primary or sole mode of communication with the family or legal guardian . If unable to contact the family or legal guardian, there should be evidence that the facility attempted to reac h alternate emergency contacts. Requests from clients who are their own guardian to limit notifications to their families must be honored. (d) Standard: Staff treatment of clients. W149 (Rev. -27-15) \u00a7483.420(d)(1) The facility must develop and implement written policies and procedures that prohibit mistreatment, neglect or abuse of the client. Guidance \u00a7483.420(d)(1) The facility, through implementation of its policies, must set up a structure that screens and trains employees, protects clients and pre vents, identifies, investigates and reports abuse, neglect and mistreatment of clients. The policies must designate who (either by name or title) has the authority to act in the Administrator's absence and take any immediate corrective actions necessary t o assure a client's safety such as removing a staff person from direct client contact. \"Mistreatment\", for the purposes of this guideline, includes behavior or facility practices that result in any type of client exploitation such as financial, physical, sexual, or criminal. Mistreatment also refers to the use of behavioral management techniques outside of their use as approved by the specially constituted committee and facility policies and procedures. \"Neglect\" means failure to provide goods and servic es necessary to avoid physical harm, mental anguish or mental illness. Staff failure to intervene appropriately to prevent self- injurious behavior may constitute neglect. Staff failure to implement facility safeguards, once client to client aggression is identified, may also constitute neglect. Refer to W127 for definitions of abuse. W150 (Rev. -27-15) \u00a7483.420(d)(1)(i) Staff of the facility must not use physical, verbal, sexual or psychological abuse or punishment. W151 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.420(d)(1)(ii) Staff must not punish a client by withholding food or hydration that contributes to a nutritionally adequate diet. -27-15) \u00a7483.420(d)(1)(iii) The facility must prohibit the employment of individuals with a conviction or prior employment history of child or client abuse, neglect or mistreatment. Guidance \u00a7483.420(d)(1)(iii) The facility is required to screen potential employees for a prior employment history of child or client abuse, neglect or mistreatment, as well as for any conviction based on those offenses. The abuse, neglect or mistreatment must have been directed toward a child or a client/resident/patient of a health care facility in order for the prohibition of employment to apply. No one with a conviction or substantiated allegation of child or client abuse, neglect or mistreatment rega rdless of employment date, is employed by the facility. This requirement also applies to acts of abuse, neglect or mistreatment committed by a current ICF/IID employee outside the jurisdiction of the ICF/IID (e.g., in the community or in another health care facility). The facility must follow state guidelines or requirements for background checks to assure that they make every effort to check new employee's background. Where the facility has terminated an employee based upon confirmation that abuse, negl ect or mistreatment occurred during the employee's performance, and the termination decision was overturned by either arbitration finding or a court finding, the employee must be returned to a position which does not involve direct contact between that em ployee and clients of the facility. A person who abused a resident in a nursing facility, and as a result, is barred from employment in the nursing home setting would also be prohibited from employment in the ICF/IID. While facilities are not required to periodically screen existing employees, if the facility becomes aware that such action has been taken against an employee, the facility is required to prohibit continued employment. This is also true of any conviction in a court of law for child, elder, or client (resident, patient) abuse, neglect or mistreatment. Therefore, conviction for abusing one's own child is also a reason employment would be prohibited. W153 (Rev. 135, -27-15) facility must ensure that all allegations of mistreatment, neglect or abuse, as well as injuries of unknown source, are reported immediately to the administrator or to other officials in accordance with State law through established proc edures. Guidance \u00a7483.420(d)(2) Injuries of unknown source that give rise to a suspicion that they may be the result of abuse or neglect, should be reported immediately. An injury should be reported as an \"injury of unknown source\" when: The source of the injury was not witnessed by any person and the source of the injury could not be explained by the client; and The injury raises suspicions of possible abuse or neglect because of the extent of the injury or the location of the injury (e.g., the injury is located in an area not generally vulnerable to trauma) or the number of injuries observed at one particular point in time or the incidence of injuries over time. It is important to note that members of the ICF/IID population are a mobile population an d lead active lives. Therefore, they experience normal day -to-day bumps and minor abrasions as they go about their lives. These minor occurrences which are not of serious consequence to the individual and do not present as a suspicious or repetitive inju ry (as discussed above) should be recorded by the facility staff once they are aware of them and follow -up should be conducted as indicated. For injuries that do not rise to the level of reportable \"injuries of unknown source\", the facility should follow its policies and procedures for incident recording, investigation, and tracking. The facility must immediately report any suspicious injuries of unknown source and all allegations of mistreatment, neglect or abuse to a client residing in the facility regardless of who is the alleged perpetrator (e.g., facility staff, parents, legal guardians, volunteer staff from outside agencies serving the client, neighbors, or other clients, etc.). If state law requires reporting to an agency or entity other than the a dministrator, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) expects the administrator to be notified as well, in order to ensure facility response to promptly safeguard the client(s). For the purposes of this regulation \"immediately\" means there shou ld be no delay between staff awareness of the occurrence and reporting to the administrator or other officials in accordance with State law unless the situation is unstable in which case reporting should occur as soon as the safety of all clients is assure d. W154 (Rev. 162, Issued: 10 -14-16, Effective: 10 -14-16, Implementation: 10- 14-16) \u00a7483.430(d)(3) The facility must have evidence that all alleged violations are thoroughly investigated ; and Guidance \u00a7483.430(d)(3) In the absence of any pre -survey information that would indicate the need for a more thorough review, the surveyors review 5 percent of the total client incidents and associated investigative reports of all alleged violations of abuse, neglect or mistreatment, as well as injuries of unkno wn source for the last three (3) months (but no less than 10). Investigative reports are completed as indicated for all allegations. A thorough investigation includes at a minimum: The collection of all interviews, statements, physical evidence and any pertinent maps, pictures or diagrams; Review of all information related to the allegation; Resolution of any discrepancies; Summary of conclusions; and Recommendations for action both to safeguard all the clients during the investigation and after the completion of the report. If patterns of possible abuse, neglect, mistreatment or injuries of unknown source are identified during the review, or the facility incident report logs for the past three (3) months indicate an extremely high incident rate, then a full review of all alleged violations of abuse, neglect or mistreatment, as well as injuries of unknown source for the past three (3) months should be completed. W155 (Rev. 135, must prevent further potential abuse while the investigation is in progress. Guidance \u00a7483.420(d)(3) The facility must take all measures necessary to protect the client, including removal of the staff from working with the client if indicated. See W154. W156 (Rev. -27-15) \u00a7483.420(d)(4) The results of all investigations must be reported to the administrator or designated representative or to other officials in accordance with Stat e law within five working days of the incident and, Guidance \u00a7483.420(d)(4) Some states require that allegations of abuse must be reported to the police. A police investigation may take longer than five (5) working days. Their investigation does not change the requirement that the facility must complete an internal investigation report of findings within the five day timeframe. When outside authorities are involved, the facility will still be required to complete their investigation within five days to the extent authorized by such entities. \"Working days\" means Monday through Friday, excluding state and Federal holidays. W157 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.420(d)(4) if the alleged violation is verified, appropriate corrective action must be taken. Guidance \u00a7483.420(d)(4) The facility is required to ensure that clients residing in the facility are not subjected to physical, verbal, sexual or psychological abuse or punishment. Appropriate corrective action is required for findings of abuse, neglect or mistreatment by other clients residing in the facility, staff of outside agencies, parents or any other person, and for injuries to clients resulting from controllable environmental factors. If the facility receives allegations of abuse, neglect, or mistreatment of a client during out of facility visits with their family, they must report these allegations to the appropriate state authority for investigation. The facility does not have to con duct an internal investigation regarding the alleged violation. Appropriate corrective action is defined as that action which is reasonably likely to prevent the abuse, neglect, mistreatment or injury from recurring. This regulation does not require staff termination as the only appropriate corrective action. The corrective action imposed by the facility is commensurate with the violation. When a facility is forced to re -hire a staff person, determined by the facility investigation to have been responsi ble for abuse, neglect, or mistreatment, the facility continues to be responsible for ensuring the health and safety of the clients, and ensures that those staff members do not work directly with clients. W158 (Rev. 135, Facility staffing. (a) Standard: Qualified disability professional client's active treatment program must be integrated, coordinated and monitored by a qualified intellectual disability professional who - Guidance \u00a7483.430(a) The position of qualified intellectual disability professional (QIDP) is unique to the ICF/IID program. This position can be central to the overall responsiveness and effectiveness of an active treatment program. Whether a supervisory or non -supervisory position, the QIDP is responsible to: Orchestrate all facets of the active treatment effort, i ncluding the IDT creation of relevant IPPs tailored to meet individual client needs; Effectively coordinate internal and external program services and supports to facilitate the acquisition of client skills and adaptive behaviors; and Promote competent interactions of residential staff with clients in program implementation and behavior management. Breakdowns in the provision of needed services does not automatically equate with deficient practice with QIDP regulations. Non -compliance with QIDP regulat ions exist where the facility has failed to provide a QIDP or sufficient numbers of QIDPs to effectively perform these required functions or the QIDP(s) has failed to assertively attempt to integrate, coordinate and/or monitor each client's active treatmen t program. Elements of integrating, coordinating and monitoring active treatment programs include: Routinely observing clients across settings in program areas to assess effectiveness of program implementation and consistency of training effort to determ ine effectiveness of IPPs and making timely modifications to facilitate achieving desired skills or goals. Routinely interacting with program staff across settings to assist in determining the effectiveness and continued relevance of program plans in meet ing identified client needs. Determining the need for program revision based on client performance. Identifying inconsistencies in training approaches or programs not being implemented as written and facilitating the resolution of these inconsistencies. Assures follow -up occurs for any recommendation for services, equipment or programs so that needed services and supplies are provided in a timely manner to meet the client's needs. The number of QIDPs will vary depending on such factors as the number of clients the facility serves, the complexity of needs manifested by these clients, the number, qualifications and competencies of additional professional staff members, and whether or not other duties are assigned to the QIDP function. The QIDP function ma y not be delegated to other employees even though the QIDP co -signs their work. -27-15) \u00a7483.430(a)(1) Has at least one year of experience working directly with persons with intellectual disability or other developmental disabilities; and Guidance \u00a7483.430(a)(1) \"Experience\" means providing professional or direct services, either paid or volunteer, in a setting that serves persons with intellectual disabilities. The experi ence working directly with persons with intellectual or other developmental disabilities can be obtained prior to or after obtaining the qualifying degree or credentials. \u00a7483.430(a)(2) Is one of the following: W161 (a)(2)(i) A doctor of medicine osteopathy. W162 individual who holds at least a bachelor's degree in a professional category specified in paragraph (b)(5) of this section Guidance \u00a7483.430(a)(2)(iii) The individual must have at least a bachelor's degree in one of the professions listed in \u00a7 483.430 (b)(5)(i -xi). (b) -27-15) \u00a7483.430 (b)(1) Each client must receive the professional program services needed to implement the active treatment program defined by each client's individual program plan. Guidance \u00a7483.430 (b)(1) The effectivenes s of the active treatment effort is dependent on a facility's assembly of a competent team of professional program staff, with knowledge of contemporary care practices in intellectual disabilities specific to their field of expertise, that work cooperative ly as members of an IDT. The facility is responsible for the acquisition of professional staff necessary to provide direct and indirect professional services to meet client needs. Professional program services are those services that meet the needs identified by a client's CFA that must be provided by a member of a vocation founded upon specialized education/training. Professional staff services also include on -going monitoring of the effectiveness of programs and plans developed by professional staff bu t implemented by non - professional staff. Indirect professional staff services also include on -going, technical support to staff implementing these programs as well as timely assessment of the need for modification of the program with appropriate communic ation to the QIDP and IDT. The needs identified in the initial CFA, as required in \u00a7483.440(c)(3)(v), should guide the team in deciding if a particular professional's involvement is necessary and, if so, to what extent professional involvement must conti nue on a direct or indirect basis. Since such needed professional expertise may fall within the purview of multiple professional disciplines, based on overlapping training and experience, determine if the facility's delivery of professional services is ad equate by the extent to which clients' needs are aggressively and competently addressed. Some examples in which professional expertise may overlap include, but are not limited to: Physical development and health : nurse, dietitian, pharmacist. Nutritional status : nurse, nutritionist or dietitian. Sensorimotor development : educators, recreation therapists, and occupational therapist, physical therapist. Affective (emotional) development: special educators, social workers, psychologists, psyc hiatrists, mental health counselors, rehabilitation counselors, behavior therapists, behavior management specialists, behavior analyst, and medical staff. Speech and language (communication) development : speech -language pathologists, special educators fo r people who are deaf or hearing impaired, and medical staff. Auditory functioning: audiologists (basic or comprehensive audiologic assessment and use of amplification equipment); speech -language pathologists (like audiologists, may perform aural rehabilitation); special educators for clients who are hearing impaired and medical staff. Cognitive development : teachers (if required by law, e.g., school aged children, or if pursuit of GED is indicated), behavior analysts, psychologists, speech -language pathologists. Vocational development : occupational therapists, vocational rehabilitation counselors, or other work specialists (if development of specific vocational skills or work placement is indicated). Social Development : teachers, professional recreation staff, social workers, behavior analysts, psychologists (specialized training needs for social skill development). Adaptive behaviors or independent living skills : special educators, occupational therapists, behavior analysts, and medical staff. W165 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.430(b)(1) program staff must work directly with clients Guidance \u00a7483.430(b)(1) Examples of professional staff working directly with clients include: performing professional assessments of clients, provision of direct support and services and periodic monitoring by the professional of the client working on the program. The amount and degree of direct care that professionals must provide will depend on the needs of the client and the ability of other staff to effectively work with clients on a day -to-day basis. For those services that must be provided by a professional due to either law, licensure or registration, the client receives the services directly from the professional. Professionals may deliver services through the supervision and direction of subordinates where provided by law. W166 (Rev. 135, paraprofess ional, nonprofessional and other professional program staff who work with clients. Guidance \u00a7483.430(b)(1) Paraprofessionals are persons in various occupational fields who are trained to assist professionals but are themselves not licensed at the profess ional level. Examples of \"working with\" these other staff may include, but not be limited to: Modeling the correct technique for interacting with clients or implementing a specific program objective. Designing residential activity programs and teaching staff how to implement them. Conducting classes on discipline specific topics. Answering questions of staff related to program implementation or specific behavioral management issues. Monitoring active treatment areas to identify program implementation or staff- client interaction issues. W167 (Rev. -27-15) \u00a7483.430(b)(2) The facility must have available enough qualified professional staff to carry out and monitor the various professional int erventions in accordance with the stated goals and objectives of every individual program plan. Guidance \u00a7483.430(b)(2) There should be sufficient professional staff in the facility to ensure that: needed assessments by professionals are completed timely; direct professional services are provided when indicated; clients are receiving interventions as specified in the IPP; client outcomes are being monitored by the professional; assessments and outcomes are being communicated to the IDT; and profess ional staff are available to consult with team members when needed. W168 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.430(b)(3) program staff must participate as members of the interdisciplinary team in re levant aspects of the active treatment process. Guidance \u00a7483.430(b)(3) When a professional does an assessment and determines there are client needs which become incorporated into the IPP, with a current prioritized objective, the professional should actively participate on the IDT. This participation may be through written reports or verbally while attending the IPP meeting or participating via telephone or other electronic means, to provide team members with the opportunity to review and discuss info rmation and recommendations relevant to the client's needs, and to reach decisions as a team, rather than individually, on how best to address those needs. W169 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.430(b)(4) Professional program staff must participate in on- going staff development and training in both formal and informal settings with other professional, paraprofessional, and nonprofessional staff members. Guidance \u00a7483.430(b)(4) Professional program staff pro vides various types of training to staff as indicated by the IPP and IDT. Formal training: a specific training done at the time a program is implemented or updated by the professional, with all staff who works with the client. Informal training: when th e professional observes the staff not correctly implementing a program, the professional provides informal guidance on correct implementation. Training on programs that apply to multiple clients: when a particular program applies to several clients in a facility, a professional may provide training to several staff on a particular topic that applies to multiple clients (such as safe transfer techniques). Professional staff of the facility should participate in ongoing training such as conferences and work shops to maintain current standards of practice in the field of intellectual and developmental disabilities as required by their professional licensure or certification. W170 (Rev. -27-15) \u00a7483.430(b)(5) Professional program staff must be licensed, certified, or registered, as applicable, to provide professional services by the State in which he or she practices.

(iii) For each defined residential living unit serving clients who function within the range of mild retardation, the staff to client ratio is 1 to 6.4. Guidance \u00a7483.430(d)(3) The minimum ratios in this standard indicate the minimum number of direct -care staff that must be present and on duty, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, for each discrete living unit. For example, to calculate the minimum number of living unit staff that must be present and on duty in a discrete living unit serving 16 individuals with multiple disabilities: divide the number of individuals \"16,\" by the number corresponding to the regulation \"3.2,\" the result equals \"5.\" Therefore, the facility must determine how many staff it must hire to ensure that at lea st 5 staff will be able to be present and on duty during the 24 hour period in which those individuals are present. Using the living unit described above, \"calculated over all shifts in a 24 -hour period\" means that there are present and on duty every day of the year: one direct care staff for each eight individuals on the first shift (1:8), one direct care staff for each eight individuals on the second shift (1:8), and one direct care staff for each 16 individuals on the third shift (1:16). Therefore, there are five (5) direct care staff present and on duty for each twenty -four hour day, for 16 individuals. The same calculations are made for the other ratios, whichever applies. Determine if absences of staff for breaks and meals results in a pattern of prolonged periods in which present and on -duty staff do not meet the ratios. W188 \u00a7483.420(d)(4) When there are no clients present in the living unit, a responsible staff member must be available by telephone. \u00a7483.430(e) Standard: Staff Training Program -27-15) \u00a7483.430(e)(1) The facility must provide each employee with initial and continuing training that enables the employee to perform his or her duties effectively, efficiently, and competently. Guidance \u00a7483.430(e)(1) Newly employed staff receive a supported orientation program (mentor or ongoing supervision) during their early employment. All staff receive continuing education on such issues as abuse and neglect, handling emergency situations, behavior management, and treating people with respect and dignity, etc. The primary evidence of an effective staff training program is the observed competent interaction between staff and clients. \u00a7483.430(e)(2) For employ ees who work with clients, training must focus on skills and competencies directed toward clients' W190 (Rev. 144, -14-15) \u00a7483.430(e)(2) Guidance \u00a7483.430(e)(2) Staff receive training in the following areas: developmental programming principles and techniques (e.g. techniques to involve clients in their programs to their highest capability, use of positive reinforcement, use of assistive technology, use of appropriate materials an d providing informal opportunities to practice skills); use of adaptive equipment and augmentative communication devices and systems; and effective recordkeeping procedures. Staff receive training in the following areas: use of behavioral principles during interactions between staff and clients; use of accurate procedures regarding abuse detection and prevention, restraints, drugs to manage behaviors, client safety, emergencies, etc.; use of least restrictive interventions; use of positive behavior intervention programming; and training clients in appropriate replacement behaviors. W192 (Rev. 135, Issu and health needs Guidance \u00a7483.430(e)(2) Staff receive training in the following areas: signs and symptoms of the client's changing health (e.g. constipation, urinary tract infections, adverse drug reactions, as indicated); exercise and diet; first aid; infection control; reporting to appropriate healthcare professionals; and for those staff who can administer medications, how to include clients in their medication administra tion by recognizing and encouraging the use of applicable skills. W193 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.430(e)(3) Staff must be able to demonstrate the skills and techniques necessary to administer interventions to manage the inappropriate behavior of clients. Guidance \u00a7483.430(e)(3) Staff correctly and consistently implement the interventions specified in the behavior plans of clients with whom they are working. Inadequate training is evident when staff do not correctly implement behavioral programs, use inappropriate management techniques, cannot explain what intervention is to be used and how it is to be implemented. W194 (Rev. 135, Staff must be able to demonstrate the skills and techniques necessary to implement the individual program plans for each client for whom they are responsible. Guidance \u00a7483.430(e)(4) Staff are observed in various settings during the day correctly and consistently implementing the specific IPPs of the clients with whom they are working. W195 (Rev. 135, Active treatment services (a) Stand Active treatment -27-15) \u00a7483.440(a)(1) Each client must receive a continuous active treatment program, which includes aggressive, consistent implementation of a program of specialized and generic training, treatment, health services and related services described in this subpart, that is directed toward- (i) The acquisition of the behaviors necessary for the client to function with as much self - determination and independence as possible; and (ii) The prevention or deceleration of regression or loss of current optimal functional status. Active treatment embodies an individually - tailored series of daily life and living experiences that serve as the primary opportunity for the acquisit ion, development and expression of functional skills and adaptive behaviors necessary for the client to experience optimal independence and promote purposeful \"self -expression\". The uniqueness of each client is a core consideration in the design of active treatment programs. It is expected that individual clients are given the opportunity to provide input into the content of their day -to-day living experiences. An active treatment program includes the following elements as substantiated through observation, interview and record review: a) Each client's needs and strengths have been accurately assessed and relevant input has been obtained from team members; (Observations and interviews with the client by the surveyor should be consistent with the cu rrent assessment information. Interview the QIDP regarding any needs observed but not addressed through assessment/programming by the facility). b) Each client's IPP is based on assessed needs and strengths, and addresses major life areas such as personal sk ills, home living skills, community living skills, employment skills, etc., essential to increasing independence and ensuring rights; c) Needs identified as a priority are addressed formally and through activities which are relevant and responsive to client need, interest and choice; d) Active treatment is consistently implemented in all relevant settings both formally and informally as the need arises or opportunities present themselves. It should not be limited to specific periods of time during the day or environments. Each client should receive aggressive and consistent training, treatments and supports in accordance with their needs and IPP. New skills and appropriate behaviors are encouraged and reinforced across environments and times of day. Each client has the adaptive equipment and environmental adaptations necessary for him/her to progress toward heightened independence as recommended and contained in their IPP. Active treatment means taking advantage of opportunities for the practice of new skills and the use of other skills during the normal rhythm of each client's day. e) Each client's performance related to IPP objectives is accurately and consistently measured and documented and programs are modified on an ongoing basis based on data and major life changes; and i. Clients with degenerative conditions receive training, treatment and services designed to retain skills and functioning and to prevent further regression to the extent possible. ii. Clients may need adjustments to their active treatment pr ograms as functional or endurance limitations are identified associated with the aging process. In such cases, there may be more of an emphasis on the retention of skills already attained and reducing the rate of loss of skills, than on the acquisition of new skills. In large part, it is this pervasive and continuous reinforcement of \"formal\" training through \"informal\" routine daily living experiences and interactions with staff and others that makes active treatment programs effective. Formal settings are those that are planned and specifically structured for training on objectives and interventions. Informal settings are times that are not anticipated or planned but that offer the opportunity for training. Active treatment programs mirror normal living experiences such as leisure activities and social conversation at the dinner table. It must be clear that active treatment programs are far more than implementation of discreet formal training sessions or programs that are conducted at prescribed times by defined personnel. Learning occurs in the process of the normal rhythm of life and life experiences. W197 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.440(a)(2) Active treatment does not include services to maintain generally independent clients who are able to function with little supervision or in the absence of a continuous active treatment program. Guidance \u00a7483.440(a)(2) All active treatment programs must be based upon assessed developmental needs whic h are prohibiting the client from living in a more independent setting. Active treatment moves clients to a more independent setting. When a client is in the facility simply for protective oversight and is not in need of training for developmental defic its, this does not constitute active treatment (e.g. a court placement to protect the community or the client from the client's behavior). Programs that are simply being provided to maintain a client's independence would not be considered active treatment since the client is not actively being trained to live in a more independent setting. If a client already possesses the skills that enables them to live in a less restrictive environment, and does not require the structure, support and resources that ser vices that only an ICF/IID can provide, they can be considered generally independent. For example, a client is admitted to the ICF/IID for the primary purpose of competency determination for a court hearing. This client lived independently prior to admis sion. The active treatment programs they are receiving are focused on maintaining that independence and do not address specific developmental deficits that inhibit independent living. This would not be considered active treatment. (b) Standard: Admissi ons, transfers, and discharge -27-15) \u00a7483.440(b)(1) Clients who are admitted by the facility must be in need of and receiving active treatment services. Guidance \u00a7483.440(b)(1) All client admissions must be based upon assessed developmental deficits which are prohibiting the client from living in a more independent setting and which require those intensive specialized supports, services, and supervision that only an ICF/IID can p rovide. The individual components of the provision of active treatment include CFA, IPP, program implementation, program documentation, and program monitoring and change. When any of these individual components of active treatment are not in place, resul ting in the clients not receiving active treatment, this regulation this not met. W199 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.440(b)(2) Admission decisions must be based on a preliminary evaluation of the client that is conducted or updated by the facility or by outside sources. Guidance \u00a7483.440(b)(2) Preliminary evaluations should support the need for an admission to an ICF/IID (e.g., deficits in functional skills or adaptive behaviors). The information from t he preliminary evaluation must be used by the facility to make an admission decision. Occasionally, emergency admissions of clients may occur without benefit of a preliminary evaluation having been conducted prior to admission . When situational emergenci es necessitate admission before a preliminary evaluation can be conducted, or when pre -admission information is incomplete, the completion of the preliminary admission evaluation within seven (7) calendar days after admission will satisfy compliance with t his requirement. W200 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.440(b)(3) A preliminary evaluation must contain background information as well as currently valid assessments of functional developmental, behavioral, social, health and nutritional status to determine if the facility can provide for the client's needs and if the client is likely to benefit from placement in the facility. Guidance \u00a7483.440(b)(3) The preliminary evaluation contains specific information useful to determine if the facility can meet the client's needs and if the client can benefit from placement. The facility makes every reasonable effort to gather all available data to assist in their determination. Background information would include information that gives insight into the clients' previous living environments and programming efforts. The assessment must include a consideration as to whether reasonable accommodation as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act would enable the c lient to benefit from placement in facility. \u00a7483.440(b)(4) If a client is to be either transferred or discharged, the facility must - - W201 (Rev. 135, documentation in the client's record that the client was transferred or discharged for good cause; and Guidance \u00a7483.440(b)(4)(i) Transfer or discharge occurs only when the facility cannot meet the client's needs, the client no longer requires an active treatment pro gram in an ICF/IID setting; the individual/guardian chooses to reside elsewhere, or when a determination is made that another level of service or living situation would be more beneficial to the client. \"Transfer\" means the temporary movement of a client to another facility (e.g. another ICF/IID, psychiatric hospital, medical hospital) with the intention of return to the original site. \"Discharge\" means the permanent movement of a client to another facility or setting which operates independently from the ICF/IID (e.g. the facility is not under the jurisdiction of the facility's governing body). Documentation includes evidence of an assessment that evaluated the pros and cons of the transfer or discharge and the rationale for the final decision. W202 (Rev. 135, Issued: 02 -27-15, Effective: 04 -27-15, Implementation: 04 -27-15) \u00a7483.440(b)(4)(ii) Provide a reasonable time to prepare the client and his or her parents or guardian for the transfer or discharge (except in emergencies). Guidance \u00a7483.440(b)( 4)(ii) The client and their family or the client and their legal guardian are involved in planning for any transfer or discharge and receive the services necessary to assist in preparing for movement, unless an emergency (medical) situation prevents that involvement. If the client has an advocate, the advocate should participate in the decision -making process. Orderly, planned transfers and discharges usually take place over an extended period of time. The IPP should reflect objectives or interventions wh ich prepare the client for transfer or discharge. Transfers or discharges executed on short timeframes (e.g. less than 30 days) without \"good cause\" would not comply with the \"reasonable\" intent of the regulations. \"Reasonable\" time is the time required t o provide clients and their families with planned steps and established timeframes to facilitate the successful transition. Time frames are modified based on client needs and emergent situations. Preparation of the client for transfer may include orientation or trial visits to the new location. Staff should take steps to minimize potential anxiety or any behavioral reactions which could result from the client's transfer. \u00a7483.440(b)(5) At the time of the discharge, the facility must - W203 (Rev. 135, Is sued: 02 -27-15, Effective: 04 -27-15, Implementation: 04 -27-15) \u00a7483.440(b)(5)(i) Develop a final summary of the client's developmental, behavioral, social, health and nutritional status Guidance \u00a7483.440(b)(5)(i) The final summary should be useful for continued services in the client's new setting. The final discharge summary should be entered into the client's record, provide a summary of the client's course of stay in the ICF/IID, provide a final summary of the client's developmental, behavioral, social, health and nutritional status, and include the current status of the objectives listed in the client's IPP. The status should address whether or not a clients' skills have been maintained, deteriorated, or improved during their stay. W204 (Rev. 135, Issued: 02 -27-15, Effective: 04 -27-15, Implementation: 04 -27-15) \u00a7483.440(b)(5)(i) and, with the consent of the client, parents (if the client is a minor) or legal guardian, provide a copy to authorized persons and agencies; and Guidance \u00a7483.440(b)(5)( i) When the client is discharged, the receiving entity (another ICF/IID, waiver home, family home, nursing home, etc.) is provided a copy of the discharge summary. The ICF/IID should obtain written consent to share this information with the persons who will be providing services to the client in the future and their parents/or legal guardians. Sharing the discharge summary with State Agencies as applicable is determined by state requirements. W205 (Rev. 135, a post -discharge plan of care that will assist the client to adjust to the new living environment. Guidance \u00a7483.440(b)(5)(ii) The post discharge plan of care is a component of the discharge summary. The f acility utilizes the information from the discharge summary to prepare the discharge plan of care. The post- discharge plan of care identifies the essential supports and services necessary for the client to successfully adjust to the new living environment and describe necessary coordination of services. It should incorporate the client's preferences. It should identify specific client needs after discharge such as personal care, physical therapy, client/caregiver education needs, and the ability of the c lient or caregiver to meet those needs after discharge. (c) Standard: Individual program plan W206 (Rev. -27-15) \u00a7483.440(c)(1) Each client must have an individual program plan developed by an interdisciplinary team that represents the professions, disciplines or service areas that are relevant to - - i) Identifying the client's needs, as described by the comprehensive functional assessments required in paragraph (c)(3) of this section; and ii) Designing programs that meet the client's needs. Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(1) If a need is identified in the CFA, the professional associated with that need will conduct an initial evaluation for the development of the IPP. The needs identified in the CFA determine the professional, paraprofessional, direct support staff, disciplines or service areas that must participate in the development of the IPP. W207 (Rev. 135, staff must participate in interdisciplinary team meetings. Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(2) While there is no correct number of individuals that comprise the IDT, the team should include appropriate facility staff (professional and paraprofessional staff), that are responsible for designing, developing, and/or implementing the client's IPP and direct support staff who work closely with the clients. For any prioritized objective, the paraprofessional or professional personnel responsible for the develop ment and monitoring of that program should participate on the team, either through actual attendance or written or verbal input. Members of the IDT may change as the assessed needs of the client change (e.g. medical issues, nutritional issues, communication needs, fine motor skill needs, gross motor skill needs, social issues or behavioral concerns). W208 (Rev. 135, by other agencies serving the clien t is encouraged. Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(2) The facility must make every effort to coordinate the Individual Education Plan (IEP) from the school or the client's program plan from outside program, work site or workshop with the IPP. This may result in a si ngle document, but there is no requirement for a single combined document. There must be evidence that all applicable plans were coordinated (evidence of discussion across the plans and observation would confirm integration of the IPP across the various s ettings). The QIDP is responsible for the coordination of the plans. The facility should communicate changes in the IPP or in the clients' life situation with teachers and workplace representatives either directly or through written communication. W209 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.440(c)(2) Participation by the client, his or her parent (if the client is a minor), or the client's legal guardian is required unless the participation is unobtainable or inappropriate. Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(2) The facility should make every effort to schedule team meetings at a time that enables the client parent or legal guardian, to attend without having to forfeit work time or pay. The facility should make every effort to schedule team meetings at a time that enables the client parent or legal guardian, to attend without having to forfeit work time or pay. It is expected that the client will routinely attend team meetings unless their participation is unobtainable. Exa mples of when client participation is not available include, but are not limited to: 1) the client is away from the facility for medical reasons or hospitalization; or 2) although the facility has documented repeated attempts to engage the client, the client refuses to participate. If families/legal guardians are unable to attend a program planning meeting, the facility provides them information regarding the meeting outcome and gives them an opportunity to discuss the plan with the facility staff. \"Unobtainable\", for the purposes of this guideline, means that the facility has made a good faith effort to seek parental or legal guardian participation in the process, even though the effort may ultimately be unsuccessful (for example, the parent may be impossible to locate or may prove unwilling or unable to participate). \"Inappropriate\", for the purposes of this guideline, means that the parent or legal guardian's behavior is so disruptive or uncooperative that others cannot effectively participate; th e client does not wish his or her parent to participate, and the client is competent to make this decision; or there is strong and documented evidence that the parent or legal guardian is not acting on the client's behalf or in the client's best interest. In the case of the latter, determine what the facility has done to bring effective resolution to the problem. Instances when it is not appropriate for the client, parent or legal guardian, to attend the team discussion are rare. If the client does not at tend the meeting, the facility must document the reason for his/her non -participation. There may also be instances where a parent or legal guardian is considered unobtainable for a team meeting, such as being out of the country. In these instances, the p arent or legal guardian should still be notified of the meeting, provided with information concerning the outcome of the meeting and documentation in the client record should describe why the parent or legal guardian could not attend and what information w as provided to them. If the client is an adult who is competent to make decisions and who is not adjudicated, parents may not participate in the process if their participation is opposed by the client. In the event that a non -adjudicated adult chooses no t to have their family involved in the active treatment process, the surveyor should see evidence in the record of efforts made by the facility to understand why the client has declined family participation. If the client continues to decline family involvement after the facility has held discussions with him/her about the importance of this issue, the facility should honor the wishes of the client. In general, the more involvement and communication among the team members, the client and the parent or leg al guardian the more likely the plan will be successful. The facility goal should be to routinely include these parties unless rare circumstances exist. W210 (Rev. 135, in 30 days after admission, the interdisciplinary team must perform accurate assessments or reassessments as needed to supplement the preliminary evaluation conducted prior to admission. Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(3) For new admissions, the CFA is completed within 30 days after admission and is utilized as the basis for the IPP. New, revised or updated assessments completed within the first 30 days of admission, accurately identify the functional abilities of the client. \"Accurate\" assessments refer to assess ment data that are current, relevant and valid, and the skills, abilities, and training needs identified by the assessment correspond to the client's actual, observed status. Assessments must be administered with appropriate adaptations such as specialize d equipment, use of an interpreter, use of manual communication and tests designed to measure performance in the presence of visual disability. The content of or format of the assessments or the particular assessment tools which are to be used for the CFA are not specified. Assessments must include identification of those functional life skills in which the client needs to be more independent and those services needed for the client to become more community integrated. W211 (Rev. 135, Issued: 04 -27-15) \u00a7483.440(c)(3) The comprehensive functional assessment must take into consideration the client's age (for example, child, young adult, elderly person) and the implications for active treatment at each stage, a s applicable, and must - Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(3) During assessment, the client is given opportunities to participate in age -appropriate activities to assess the person's functioning in those activities or settings. For example, the use of baby toys duri ng the assessment of an adult would not be appropriate. W212 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.440(c)(3)(i) Identify the presenting problems and disabilities and where possible, their causes; Guidance \u00a7483. 440(c)(3)(i) The CFA includes: all diagnoses and developmental deficits for the client; the supporting information for each; and each evaluation should include conclusions and recommendations which go into the development of an active treatment program for the client. W213 (Rev. 135, developmental strengths; Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(3)(ii) The client's identified developmental strengths, preferences, methods of coping/compensation, community use and awareness, friendships and positive attributes and capabilities are clearly described in functional terms in the assessments. Identified strengths are consistent with the client's observed fun ctional status. specific developmental and behavioral management needs; Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(3)(iii) The CFA must address and identify those skill deficits/needed supports that may be amenable to training, those that must be treated by therapy and/or provision of assistive technology, and those that require adapting the environment and/or providing personal support. Assessment o f needed supports should be done within the context of the client's age, gender, and culture. \"Behavioral management needs\" include those behaviors that interfere with progress, prevent assimilation into the community, decrease freedom or increase the nee d for restriction of activities (e.g. spitting, pica, self- injurious behavior, aggressive behavior toward others or self- injurious behavior). A functional behavioral assessment is a problem -solving process for evaluating client inappropriate behavior. It relies on a variety of techniques and strategies to identify the purpose of the specific behavior(s) and to help the IDT select interventions to directly address the behavior(s). A functional behavior assessment looks beyond the behavior itself. The foc us when conducting a functional behavioral assessment is on identifying significant client -specific social, affective, cognitive, and/or environmental factors associated with the occurrence (and non-occurrence) of specific behaviors. The CFA must identify the specific accommodations that address the client's needs to ensure better opportunity for the client's success. The identified accommodations may be assistive technology which can help a person learn, play, complete tasks, get around, communicate, hea r or see better, control their own environment and take care of their personal needs (e.g. door levers instead of knobs, plate switches, audio books, etc.). W215 (Rev. 135, the client's needs for services without regard to the actual availability of the services needed; and Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(3)(iv) Identification of needed services is based on the CFA. In the presence of significant developmental deficit s, it is not acceptable for the facility to say that a particular professional therapy or treatment is not needed or not available if the CFA identifies a deficit. The assessment must identify the course of specific interventions recommended to meet the c lient's needs, both through direct professional services and non - professional services. For example, a client's communication skill development may not require the intensive services of a speech -language pathologist however, the direct care staff will nee d to work with the client and use a pre -determined communication system. \u00a7483.440(c)(3)(v) Include Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(3)(v) The CFA should include an assessment of each of the areas listed below. Assessments should include specific information about the person's ability to function in different environments, specific skills or lack of skills, and how function can be improved, either through training, environmental adaptations, or provision of adaptive, assistive, supportive, orthotic, or prosthetic eq uipment. If assessments are done separately by professional disciplines, there should be evidence that the assessments are brought together in an interdisciplinary approach to address the client's various developmental areas. The CFA must be completed up on admission and annually as indicated. While the assessment may not have the specific titles of the areas listed below, the surveyor must be able to identify information within assessments from each of the areas below. W216 (Rev. 135, development and health, Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(3)(v) Physical development and health : This portion of the CFA includes the client's developmental history, results of the physical examination conducted by a licensed physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner, health assessment data (including a medication and immunization histo ry); a review and summary of all laboratory reports since the last comprehensive evaluation, a summary of all required medical interventions since the last CFA; skills of the client normally associated with the monitoring and supervision of one's own healt h status, and administration and/or scheduling of one's own medical treatments. Reports of all specialist consultations should be included in the assessment as indicated by physical examination results. IDT reviews any current advanced directives that the client may have in place as part of the CFA. W217 (Rev. 135, status, Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(3)(v) Nutritional status : Nutritional status includes height and weight, the client's eating habits and preferences, favorite foods, determination of appropriateness of diet, adequacy of total food intake, bowel habits, means through which the client receives nutrition (e.g. feeding tube) and the skills associated with eating (including chewing, sucking and swallowing disorders). W218 (Rev. 135, Sensorimotor development : Sensorimotor development includes the development of perceptual skills that are involved in observing the environment and making sense of it. Identified sensory deficits should be evaluated in conjunction with the impact they will have on the client's life. A sensory deficit in eye contact may not have a detrimental effect on the client's life if it will not hold the client back from further accomplishments or skill acquisitions. Motor development includes those behaviors that primarily involve: muscu lar, neuromuscular, or physical skills and varying degrees of physical dexterity. Because sensory and motor development are intimately related and because activities in these areas are functionally inseparable, attention to these two aspects of bodily act ivity is often combined in the concept of sensorimotor development. For those motor areas that are identified by the assessment as limited, the assessment should specify the extent to which corrective, orthotic, prosthetic, or support devices would impact on functional status and the extent of time the device is to be used throughout the day. W219 (Rev. 135, Affective (Emotional) development : Affective or emotional development includes the development of behaviors that relate to one's interests, attitudes, values, morals, emotional feelings and emotional expressions. W220 (Rev. 135, and language development Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(3)(v) Speech and language (communication) development : One of the most contributable causes of behaviors, frustration by the clients, etc. is lack of e ffective communication. It is imperative that the CFA identifies how the client communicates, what barriers are present, what services are available and what programs and services will be provided to assist the client to go out into and participate fully in the world. Observed client communication skills match the evaluation results and that training programs are in place to address needs. Communication development refers to the development of both verbal and nonverbal and receptive and expressive commun ication skills. Assessment data identify the appropriate intervention strategy to be applied, and which, if any, augmentative or assistive devices will improve communication and functional status. These intervention strategies should provide the client w ith a viable means of communication which is appropriate to their sensory, cognitive and physical abilities. W221 (Rev. 135, functioning: Auditory functioning refers to the extent to which a person can hear, to the maximum use of residual hearing if a hearing loss exists, and whether or not the client will benefit from the use of amplification, including a hear ing aid or a program of amplification. W222 (Rev. development, Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(3)(v) Cognitive development : Cognitive development refers to the development of those processes by which information received by the senses is stored, recovered, and used. It includes the development of the processes and abilities involved in memory, reasoning and problem solving. It is also the identification of different learning styles the client has and those best used by the trainers. It is critical that the CFA address the individual learning style of the client in order to best direct the way the trainers will teach formal and informal programs. W223 (Rev. 135, Issued: 02 -27-15, Effective: development, Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(3)(v) Social Development: Social development refers to the formation of those self -help, recreation and leisure, and interpersonal skills that enable a client to establish and maintain appropriate roles and fulfilling relationships with others. Assessments may address family sup ports and relationships, sexual awareness and sexuality, friendships, social awareness, social skills and social interests. W224 (Rev. 135, behaviors or independe nt living skills necessary for the client to be able to function in the community, Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(3)(v) Adaptive behaviors or independent living skills : Adaptive behavior refers to the effectiveness or degree with which clients meet the standards of personal independence and social responsibility and community orientation and integration expected of their age and cultural group. Adaptive behaviors are those behaviors that are developed to cope with deficits in order to be able to perform every day skills as independently as possible. Independent living skills include, but are not limited to, such things as food shopping, meal preparation, housekeeping and kitchen chores, laundry, bed making, and budgeting. Assessment may be performed by anyone tr ained to do so. Standardized tests are not required. Standardized adaptive behavior scales which identify all or predominantly all \"developmental needs\" are not sufficient to meet this requirement, but can serve as a basis for screening. W225 (Rev. 135, Issued: 02 -27-15, Effective: 04 -27-15, Implementation: -27-15) \u00a7483.440(c)(3)(v) vocational skills. Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(3)(v) Vocational development, \"as applicable\" : Vocational development refers to work interests, work skills, work attitudes, work -related behaviors, and present and future employment options. The determination of whether or not a vocational assessment is \"applicable\" is typically based on age (adolescents or adults more than likely require this type of assessmen t). The vocational assessment for each client may address job sampling, job development, on -site job training and long term follow -up, as appropriate to the client and determined by the IDT. Vocational assessments should describe, for all domains, what c lients can and cannot do in terms of skills needed within the context of their daily lives and jobs. Assessments should be individualized and based on: Actual performance of the client against objective criteria; Reports by staff/parents/legal guardians; and Observed performance in a variety of settings. W226 \u00a7483.440(c)(4) Within 30 days after admission, the interdisciplinary team must prepare for each client an individual program plan W227 (Rev. 135, states the specific objectives necessary to meet the client's needs, as identified by the comprehensive assessment required by paragraph (c)(3) of this section, Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(4) Objectives are developed for those needs that are identified by the CFA and which are considered to be most likely to improve the client's ability to independently function in his/her daily life, as determined by the IDT. There is a clear link between the specific objectives and the functional assessment data and recommendations. Objectives are developed for those needs that are observed to most likely impact the client's ability to function in daily life. Training objectives should be developed to address client needs rather than s taff oriented objectives. Clients are expected to have training objectives in the areas of activities of daily living, based on the client's assessed needs and as prioritized by the IDT. If clients have eyeglasses, dentures and/or other assistive devices it is expected that the team considers objectives, based upon the assessment of client needs, addressing the care and use of such devices. However, in the area of programs to teach the clients' money management it is not expected that every client will automatically have a formal training objective to participate in such a program. The decision to prioritize such a program and to what level the program is developed is decided by the IDT based upon the results of the CFA and in consideration of such facto rs as, transferable skills, the ability to make choices, the ability to identify preferences and cognitive abilities such as attention span and an understanding of the principle of cause and effect. Similarly, the decision to prioritize and develop a training objective for a client to participate in a self- administration program for medications must be made by the IDT and be based upon information from the CFA. Formal self administration programs should not be confused with informal efforts to include the client in the administration process such as allowing them to hold a glass of water, identify the box where his/her medications are stored or put a pill into their own mouth themselves under the supervision of a person who is qualified to administer medic ations. -27-15) \u00a7483.440(c)(4) and the planned sequence for dealing with those objectives. Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(4) The objectives identified in W227 are organized in a logical sequence, determined by the team that will assist the client toward the attainment of skills resulting in greater self- choice, independence, and community integration. The logical sequencing of objectives means there is a completion of one objective that serves as the building block for the next with relevance to the client's functional status. Where objectives are logically ordered but do not have relevance to the client's functional status, refer to 483.440(c)(4). If the IPP is organized in a logical s equence, this requirement is met. For example, if the long term goal is to travel independently in the community, the objective sequencing may involve training the client to recognize traffic signs, cross the street safely, and to obtain help when needed i f lost or an emergency arises. These objectives must - W229 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.440(c)(4)(i) stated separately, in terms of a single behavioral outcome; Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(4)(i) Each objective clearly states one expected learning result. \"Single\" behavioral outcome means that there is a separate objective assigned for each discrete behavior that the team intends the client to learn. For example, \"Mary will bake a cake and clean the o ven\" are two separate behaviors and, therefore, should be stated in two separate objectives. Completion of the morning hygiene routine includes programs for performance of face washing, tooth brushing and hair combing which are three separate objectives; however, the behavioral outcome for each would be the same (e.g. completion of the morning hygiene routine). W230 (Rev. 135, dates; ance \u00a7483.440(c)(4)(ii) Completion dates are based on the client's rate of learning. Completion dates are assigned to each objective on which the client is currently working. Completion dates are individualized (e.g. not all the same for all clients and all objectives). The \"projected date of completion\" for an IPP objective is not the same as a \"review\" date. For each objective assigned a priority, the team should assign a projected date (month and year) by which it believes the client will have learn ed the new skill, based on all of the assessment data. This date triggers the team to evaluate continuously whether or not the client's progress or learning curve is sufficient to warrant a revision to the training program. W231 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.440(c)(4)(iii) Be expressed in behavioral terms that provide measurable indices of performance; Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(4)(iii) The desired learning outcome is stated in a manner which enables all staff working with the client to consistently identify the target behavior and to clearly identify when it is being displayed. The objective is stated in a manner which permits it to be measured with quantifiable data. \"Behavioral\" terms include only tho se behaviors which are \"client\" rather than staff oriented and those that any person would agree can be seen or heard. Determine if all staff who work with the client can define the exact same outcome on which to measure the client's performance. \"Measur able indices of performance\" are the quantifiable criteria to use in determining successful achievement of the objective. Quantifiable criteria include various measurements of intensity and duration. For example, \"Client X will walk ten feet, with the us e of her tripod walker, on each of five (5) consecutive days.\" W232 (Rev. -27-15) \u00a7483.440(c)(4)(iv) Be organized to reflect a developmental progression appropriate to the individual; and Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(4)(iv) Objectives must be relevant to the client's current skill sets and abilities as identified in the CFA. The ICF/IID must consider the person's current functional abilities and project what steps, methods, and strategies are likel y to be effective in achieving the objective. W233 (Rev. 135, assigned priorities. Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(4)(v) Priorities are established based on the needs and in consideration of the desires of the client and emphasize the development of greater independence, self -choice, and community integration. The team determines which objectives are the highest priority to be addressed, either because the client has an immed iate need or the priority objectives must be accomplished before other priorities are addressed. \u00a7483.440(c)(5) Each written training program designed to implement the objectives in the individual program plan must specify: Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(5) The f ollowing regulations (5) (i- iv) apply to formal training programs developed for current implementation. W234 (Rev. 135, to be used; Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(5)(i) The training program provides clear directions to any staff person working with the client on how to implement the teaching strategies. To comply with this requirement the methodologies must be written in a clear enough manner that a substitute staff per son will be able to read the methodologies and implement them without substantial differences from a regularly assigned staff person. Methodologies should be consistent across settings, such as when the client is in the day program. W235 (Rev. 135, Issue d: 02 -27-15, Effective: 04 -27-15, Implementation: 04 -27-15) \u00a7483.440(c)(5)(ii) The schedule for use of the method; Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(5)(ii) Active treatment (the implementation of training programs pursuant to objectives) should be provided in formal and informal settings throughout the rhythm of the client's day. While there may be structured episodes when the client works intensively and singularly on one or more objectives (schedule), the provision of active treatment is not adequate when confined solely to these types of formal settings but should be incorporated into all activities when appropriate (client's routine). For example, objectives on grasping may be as effectively carried out during the client's use of a toothbrush and a spoon as in a n isolated session. W236 (Rev. 135, responsible for the program; Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(4)(v) The IPP should include the actual name of the staff person who is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of the client's program to ensure it is being implemented appropriately, as well as the designated position which will implement the program. The QIDP should be familiar with the assessment and recording requiremen ts for each client for each formal objective, including who is responsible for making these observations and completing the recording, and demonstrate a familiarity with the current data recorded for each client. W237 (Rev. 135, The type of data and frequency of data collection necessary to be able to assess progress toward the desired objectives; Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(5)(iv) The IDT must determine the type of data necess ary to judge a client's progress on an objective, and describe the data collection method in the written training program. The facility determines what data to collect, but whatever system is chosen for collection must yield accurate measurement of the criteria stated in the client's IPP objectives. For example, if the criteria in the client's IPP objective specified a behavior to be measured by \"accuracy,\" or \"successes out of opportunities,\" then it would not be acceptable for the prescribed data collec tion method to record \"level of prompt\". Examples of a few data collection systems include, but are not limited to: level of prompt; successful trials completed out of opportunities given; frequency counts; and frequency sampling. The IDT must consider and select the type and frequency of data collection for each objective based upon the need to measure appropriately the client's performance toward the targeted IPP skill development. The facility should collect data with enough frequency and co ntent to be able to appropriately measure the client's performance toward the targeted IPP skill development. The frequency of data collection may vary with the objective but must be made at sufficient intervals to allow analysis of the progress of the client. W238 (Rev. 135, if applicable; and The inappropriate client behavior(s), if applicable; and Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(5)(v) Any specific behaviors which would interfere with the client's ability to function in, or benefit from the training program are identified (e.g. a fear of water could interfere with the client's bathing program). W239 (Rev. -27-15) \u00a7483.440(c)(5)(vi) Provision for the appropriate expression of behavior and the replacement of inappropriate behavior, if applicable, with behavior that is adaptive or appropriate. Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(5)(vi) The train ing program provides specific information as to how to elicit or strengthen appropriate behavior and what behaviors to teach reinforce or encourage which would reduce or replace the inappropriate behavior. If a client is exhibiting an inappropriate behavi or, the CFA should discover why the behavior is occurring and the team should develop associated training objectives to help the client develop more appropriate behaviors. The objective for decelerating targeted inappropriate behaviors is not solely the r eduction of these behaviors. The objective should also include the positive functional replacement behavior (adaptive behavior). A replacement behavior allows a client to substitute an unconstructive or disruptive behavior with something more constructiv e and functionally equivalent. For example, instead of throwing work materials as a way to get a break from vocational task demands, teach the client to say or sign for 'break'. \u00a7483.440(c)(6) The individual program plan must also: 04 -27-15) \u00a7483.440(c)(6)(i) Describe relevant interventions to support the individual toward independence. Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(6)(i) Appropriate materials, adaptations and modifications to equipment and the environment are available in order to promote and support individual training programs. Examples may include, but are not limited, to built -up toilet seats, adaptive eating utensils, extended reach devices, and modification to the facility van to accommodate a wheelchair. The IPP describes supports and services, in addition to the individual goals and objectives that will be provided by the facility to assist the client to function with greater independence. W241 (Rev. 135, Identify the location where program strategy information (which must be accessible to any person responsible for implementation) can be found. Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(6)(ii) This requirement refers to the training program plans, objectives, descriptions of staff interventions and data collection tools which must be readily accessible to any staff in order for the programs to be consistently and effectively carried out and data collected. W242 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.440(c)(6)(iii) Include, for those clients who lack them, training in personal skills essential for privacy and independence (including, but not limited to, toilet training, personal hygiene, dental hygiene, self -feeding, bathing, dressing, grooming, and communication of basic needs), until it has been demonstrated that the client is developmentally incapable of acquiring them. Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(6)(iii) All clients who lack the skills listed within this standard have associated training programs developed to meet their needs according to prioritization. These programs are consistently implemented in both formal and informal settings. \"Developmentally incapable\" is a decision made by the IDT that means a client does not have the capacity to acquire certain skill sets. The decision must be based on an assessment of the client's strengths, needs, and functional limitations. The determination of developmental incapability m ust be accompanied by written evidence supporting this determination. Such evidence may include training programs which failed after many different strategies were tried, or physical limitations that preclude the acquisition of the skill. Examples are: 1) Eye contact program was attempted using seven different methods over a two year period; 2) An client has two frozen elbow joints which do not allow her to get her hands to her mouth and consequently she will not be trained on any hand to mouth skills; and 3) Some clients may have insufficient neuromuscular and sensory control to ever be totally independent in toileting skills. Toilet scheduling alone without any plan to progress would not be considered a toilet training program. The components of functional skills \"training\" as used in this regulation means aggressive implementation of a systematic program of formal and informal techniques, which are: targeted toward assisting the client achieving the measurable behavioral level of skill competency specified in IPP objectives; implemented at natural occurrences of activity and training programs; ( e.g.: an objective for a client to increase grasping may be implemented as easily in the workshop with a built up tool as in the bathroom with a toothbrush); cond ucted by all personnel involved with the client including those outside the home such as in day programs; and carried out in conversation and interaction with the client appropriate to the situation. \u00a7483.440(c)(6)(iv) Identify mechanical supports, if ne eded, to achieve proper body position, balance, or alignment. The plan must specify Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(6)(iv) The use of mechanical supports are based upon an individual assessment and fitting. Mechanical devices are used to support a client's proper body position or alignment and may be essential to prevent contractures or deformities. However, mechanical supports restrict movement and the client should be released from the support periodically for exercise and free movement. Mechanical supports ma y not be used as a substitute for programs or therapy. For example, the use of a bolster to position a client upright in a sitting position without any indication there has been an assessment for the need for muscle re -training may be an indication of a m echanical device in lieu of programming. Some supports allow movement and provide opportunity for more increased functioning. Some examples of devices used as mechanical supports include splints, wedges, bolsters, lap trays, etc. Wheelchairs are not gene rally used to position or align the body and would not alone constitute a mechanical support. However, adaptations to a wheelchair which facilitate correct body alignment by inhibiting reflexive, involuntary motor activity are mechanical supports and shou ld be included in the plan for the client. W243 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.440(c)(6)(iv) situations in which each is to be applied, W245 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.440(c)(6)(iv) a schedule for the use of each support. W246 (Rev. 135, Provide that clients who have multiple disabling conditions spend a major portion of each waking day out of bed and outside the bedroom area, moving about by various methods and devices whenever pos sible. Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(6)(v) Clients with sensory or physical difficulties should be given the same opportunities to move around in their environments as clients who do not have those difficulties. Even clients who use specialized wheelchairs should be given the opportunity to utilize other devices such as walkers, wagons and scooters to move about and/or change their positions. With the exception of those clients who are acutely ill (such as those who are hospitalized or incapacitated by a \"short term\" illness), all clients should be out of bed and outside their bedroom area as long as possible each day, and in proper body alignment at all times. This is a necessity in order to prevent regression, contractures, and deformities and to provide senso ry stimulation. Bed rest is a temporary situation associated most usually with a medical condition and must be ordered by the medical staff of the facility. The term implies that the client will remain in his/her bed for most of any 24 -hour period. Alth ough active treatment programs may be carried out to some extent while the client is on bed rest, the client's program cannot be completed in its entirety. While there may be situations where continuous bed rest may be necessary, these situations are rare . For those rare instances where out- of-bed activity is a threat to a client's health and safety (e.g., blood clot in the leg), active treatment adapted to the medical capacity of the client must be continued. W247 (Rev. choice and self -management. Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(6)(vi) Choice and self- management are integral components of becoming independent. Clients should be given opport unities for choice and self- management in both formal and informal settings through the IPP process, leisure activities, and other life choices. The ICF/IID must incorporate opportunities into daily life experiences that promote choice making and decision making by clients. Examples of some activities leading toward responsibility for one's own self- management include, but are not limited to: 1) choosing housing or roommates; 2) choosing clothing to purchase or wear; 3) choosing what, where, and how to eat (e.g. , the use of family style dining, access to condiments and second helpings). Choices can be made by all clients. The type of choices the person makes may vary from simple to complex, dependent upon client abilities. Clients are provided opportunities for choice and self -management and the facility does not limit choices by making decisions for the people being served without their input. Clients are provided the opportunity to demonstrate skills to the degree they are capable and only assisted by staf f as indicated in their IPP. A lack of facility staffing or staff convenience must not result in a limitation of choices of self- management for the clients. W248 (Rev. copy of each client's individual plan must be made available to all relevant staff, including staff of other agencies who work with the client, and to the client, parents (if the client is a minor) or legal guardian. Guidance \u00a7483.440(c)(7) The client or legal representative, as well as the facility staff, and staff from outside agencies, with appropriate consent, have, or can access, a copy of the IPP. (d) Standard: Program implementation W249 as the interdisciplinary team has formulated a client's individual program plan, each client must receive a continuous active treatment program consisting of needed interventions and services in sufficient numbe r and frequency to support the achievement of the objectives identified in the individual program plan. Guidance \u00a7483.440(d)(1) There should be no delay in the development and implementation of the IPP. To promote a team process and meaningful discussio n, IPP development should take place during IDT meetings. Any IPP objective or modification that is critical to the health and safety of any client should be implemented immediately following IDT discussion.\" Each individual receives training and service s consistent with the current IPP. The time period between admission and the 30 day IDT meeting is primarily to assist the client to become adjusted and acclimated to his or her new living environment and to enable the facility to complete the CFA. Durin g this time period the facility should also be providing those services and activities determined during the pre -admission assessment as essential to the client's daily functioning. The active treatment program for the client is consistently implemented i n all relevant settings both formally and informally as opportunities present themselves. It should not be limited to specific periods of time during the day or specific environments. Each client should receive aggressive and continuous training, treatme nts and supports in accordance with their needs and IPP. New skills and appropriate behaviors are encouraged and reinforced across environments and times of day. During observations confirm that the client activities relate directly to the strengths, needs and objectives in the IPP for each client and are not \"busy work,\" generalized or non-developmental time fillers. For example, screwing nuts on bolts and then unscrewing them repeatedly with no goal or transferable skills is \"busy work.\" Screwing nuts on bolts that will be part of a product is functional reinforcement of skill acquisition. Clients use adaptive equipment, assistive devices, environmental supports, materials, supplies, etc., as specified in each client's IPP to assist the client to accomplish stated objectives. There is no specific number or frequency of interventions that meets this requirement. The surveyors should see that the facility capitalizes on all opportunities throughout the course of the day that promote progress toward the achievement of goals and objectives. Informal opportunities (\"teachable moments\") should be utilized to reinforce learning or appropriate skill development and needs are addressed as they present. Although a client may not be able to reach complete independence in a functional skill, it is crucial that retention of their current skills be supported. Clients may have defined periods of time where they may engage in leisure activities of their choice which are not necessarily directly associated with their IPP goals and objectives. W250 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.440(d)(2) The facility must develop an active treatment schedule that outlines the current active treatment program and that is readily available for review by relevant staff. Guidance \u00a7483.440(d)(2) The schedule is individualized, consistent with the client's objectives, and reflects normal daily routines. The staff working with individual clients are familiar with their daily schedule s and can produce the schedule upon request. The active treatment schedule allows flexibility and is adjusted to the needs and preferences of the client, as necessary. It's a schedule of the client's general daily plans, but can be changed. The active treatment schedule is a functional schedule which enables client and staff to be in the right location in order to participate in the training as scheduled by the IPP. W251 (Rev. 135, Except for those facets of the individual program plan that must be implemented only by licensed personnel, each client's individual program plan must be implemented by all staff who work with the client, including professional, paraprofessional and nonprofessional staff. Guidance \u00a7483.440(d)(3) All disciplines, including direct care staff, interacting with the client work together to provide a uniform, consistent approach to implementation of the IPP. (e) Standard: Program documentation W252 (Rev. -27-15) \u00a7483.440(e)(1) Data relative to accomplishment of the criteria specified in client individual program plan objectives must be documented in measurable terms. Guidance \u00a7483.4 40(e)(1) \"Data\" are defined to be performance information collected and reported in numerical or quantifiable form for each training objective assigned priority in the IPP. Data are those performance measurements collected at the time the treatment, proc edure, intervention or interaction occurs with the client and recorded as soon as possible. The data should be located in a place accessible to staff who conduct training. Data should be collected in a form and frequency as required by the plan to enable quantitative (frequency or numbers) analysis of the client's progress. Data are accurate (e.g., reflective of actual client performance.) \u00a7483.440(e)(2) The facility must document significant events that W253 (Rev. related to the client's individual program plan and assessments and Guidance \u00a7483.440(e)(2) Significant events are those events which would cause a reasonable person to be affected and which impact a normal routine. Such events include changes in the client's functional status, emotional health, physical health, accomplishments, activities or needs which impact the CFA and IPP, as well as instances of abuse, neglect or mistreatment. The client reco rd should contain documentation that such events are evaluated and monitored.

W259 (Rev. 135, -27-15, Implementation: 04 -27-15) \u00a7483.440(f)(2) the comprehensive functional assessment of each client must be reviewed by the interdisciplinary team for relevancy and updated as needed; Guidance \u00a7483.440(f)(2) The CFA is reviewed at least annually. The review of the CFA occurs sooner than annually if: indicated by the needs of the client; reflects any changes in the client since their last evaluation; and incorporates information about the client's progress or regression with objectives. The review of the CFA applies to all evaluations conducted for a client. It is not required that each assessment be completely redone each year, except the physical examination. It is required that at least annually the assessment(s) be updated when changes occur so as to accurately reflect the client's current status. W260 (Rev. -27-15) \u00a7483.440(f)(2) and the individual program plan must be revised, as appropriate, repeating the process set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. Guidance \u00a7483.440(f)(2) The IPP reflects the functional changes for the client which occurred since the last IPP.

W261 (Rev. 144, Issued: 08- 14-15, Effective: 08 -14-15, Implementation: 08 -14-15) \u00a7483.440(f)(3) The facility must designate and use a specially constituted committee or committees consisting of members of facility staff, parents, legal guardians, clients (as appropriate), qualified persons who have either experience or training in cont emporary practices to change inappropriate client behavior, and persons with no ownership or controlling interest in the facility to - - Guidance \u00a7483.440(f)(3) The facility must have a specially constituted committee whose primary function is to proactiv ely protect client rights by monitoring facility practices and programs. The purpose of the committee is to assure that each client's rights are protected utilizing a group of both internal staff and external participants who have no vested interest in th e facility as well as clients as appropriate. There should be evidence that the committee members have been trained annually on the rights of the clients, what constitutes a restriction of a right and the difference between punishment and training. Depen ding on size, complexity and available resources, the ICF/IID may establish more than one specially constituted committee. However, each committee must contain the required membership and participate regularly and perform the functions of the committee ac cording to the requirements. Participation on the specially constituted committee(s) must be in real time allowing all membership to speak and discuss in an interactive mode. The regulation does not specify the professional credentials of the \"qualified persons\" (who have either experience or training in contemporary practices to change inappropriate client behavior). There is no requirement that any specific discipline, such as nurse, physician or pharmacist be a member of the committee. The intent of including \"persons with no ownership or controlling interest\" on the committee is to assure that, in addition to having no financial interest in the facility, at least one member of each constituted committee is an impartial outsider in that he/she would n ot have an \"interest\" represented by any other of the required members or the facility itself. Staff and consultants employed by the facility or at another facility under the same governing body, cannot fulfill the role of person with no ownership or cont rolling interest. Although occasional absences from committee meetings are understandable, patterns of absence by the required membership of the committee is not acceptable. At least a quorum of committee members (as defined by the facility) must review, approve and monitor the programs which involve risk to client rights and protections and that quorum must include one person from each of the required categories. W262 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.440(f)(3)(i) Review, approve, and monitor individual programs designed to manage inappropriate behavior and other programs that, in the opinion of the committee, involve risks to client protection and rights; Guidance \u00a7483.440(f)(3)(i) Any program t hat utilizes restrictive or intrusive techniques must be reviewed and approved by the specially constituted committee prior to implementation . This includes, but is not limited to: restraints; drugs to manage behavior; restrictions on community access; contingent denial of any right; or restrictions of materials or locations in the home. The committee should ensure that consequences within a written behavior management program do not violate the client's rights. There is no requirement for the committee to evaluate whether the proposed program is consistent with current practices in the field. Documentation should verify that the specially constituted committee considered factors, such as whether less intrusive methods have been attempted, whether the severity of behavior outweighs the risks of the proposed program and whether replacement behaviors are included within the plan. Any revision to a behavior plan that increases the level of intrusiveness must be re -reviewed by the specially constituted co mmittee. The committee need not reapprove a program when revisions are made in accordance with the approved plan. For example, if the physician changes the dosage of a medication in accordance with the drug treatment component of the active treatment plan to which the legally authorized person has given consent and which has already been approved by the committee, then there is no need for the committee or the legally authorized person to reapprove the plan. Generally, this would also apply if the medica tion was changed to another within the same therapeutic class or family. W263 (Rev. 135, Insure that these programs are conducted only with the written informed consent of the client, parents (if the client is a minor) or legal guardian; and Guidance \u00a7483.440(f)(3)(ii) The committee must ensure that written informed consent must be o btained prior to implementation of any restrictive or intrusive program. In the event of an emergency, the facility may obtain a verbal consent, which must be authenticated in writing as soon as possible and subsequently submitted to the committee as verif ication. The consent is required for the entire behavior management program not just the specific restrictive technique. Consent is informed when the person giving consent is fully aware of the: specific treatment; reason for treatment or procedure;; the attendant risks vs. benefits; alternatives; right to refuse; and the consequences associated with consent or refusal of the program. Informed consent must be in writing and must be specific to the program and restrictive practice and reflect a speci fic time frame. Blanket consents are not allowed. In the case of unplanned events such as assault and property destruction requiring immediate action, verbal consent may be obtained. However, it should be authenticated in writing as soon as reasonably possible (within 30 days). For clients up to the age of 18, their parent or legally appointed guardian must give consent for him or her. At the age of 18, however, clients become adults and are assumed to be competent unless otherwise determined by a cour t. For clients who are adults and have not been adjudicated incompetent and have not been assigned a legal guardian who may not fully understand the consequences of the program, informed consent for use of restrictive programs, practices or procedures sho uld be obtained from a person or an entity in accordance with state law, to act as the representative or advocate of the client's interests. The specially constituted committee must ensure that the informed and voluntary consent of the client, parent of a minor, legal guardian, or the person or organization designated by the state is obtained prior to each of the following circumstances: The involvement of the client in research activities; or Implementation of programs or practices that could abridge or involve risks to client protections or rights. W264 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.440(f)(3)(iii) Review, monitor and make suggestions to the facility about its practices and programs as they relate to drug usage, physical restraints, time -out rooms, application of painful or noxious stimuli, control of inappropriate behavior, protection of client rights and funds, and any other areas that the committee believes need to be addressed. Guidance \u00a7483.440(f )(3)(iii) The committee has been made aware of and reviewed: facility policies and procedures; facility services; programs; and practices which may restrict or violate the rights of client. The committee has established and uses a mechanism for monitor ing clients' rights issues and informs the governing body of any issues of concern in a timely manner. This process is at the discretion of the committee. There is no requirement for periodic review of the policies by the committee. The function of the committee is not limited to the review, approval and monitoring of restrictive behavior management practices. Examples of issues involving client rights that might be reviewed by the committee, in addition to behavior management, include, but are not limited to: 1) Research proposals involving clients; 2) Abuse, neglect and mistreatment of clients; 3) Allegations dealing with theft of a client's personal property or funds; 4) Damage to a client's goods or denial of other client rights; 5) Client grievances; 6) Visitation procedures; 7) Guardianship/advocacy issues; 8) Rights training programs; 9) Confidentiality issues; 10) Advance directives/DNR orders; 11) Practices which restrict clients (e.g. , locked doors, fenced in yards); and 12) Video monitoring. W265 \u00a7483.440(f)(4) The provisions of paragraph (f)(3) of this section may be modified only if, in the judgment of the State survey agency, Court decrees, State law or regulations provide for equivalent client protection and consultation. W266 (Rev. 135, participation: Client behavior and facility practices (a) Standard: Facility practices -- Conduct toward clients W267 \u00a7483.450(a)(1) The facility must develop and implement written policies and procedures for the management of conduct between staff and clients. Guidance \u00a7483.450(a)(1) The primary survey emphasis is on the implementation of the policies and procedures developed by the facility. Conduct between staff and clients refers to language, actions, discipline, rules, order and other types of interactions exchanged between staff and clients or imposed upon clients by the staff during a client's daily experiences that affect the quality of a client's life. \u00a7483.450(a)(1) These policies and procedures must - -27-15) development and independence of the cl ient; Guidance \u00a7483.450(a)(1)(i) Consistent with facility policies, staff is observed to be engaged in activities which promote the client's growth, development and independence. 1) IPPs and data support the fact that from the time of admission, clients are learning new adaptive and functional skills while becoming more independent. 2) Interactions between clients and staff are consistent and positive. 3) Staff teach and encourage clients to interact with each other in a manner that promotes social integration both in the facility and out in the community. 4) All opportunities to teach and reinforce skill acquisition are utilized. 5) Staff identify and remove impediments in the learning environment (e.g. client is unable to concentrate in a room with a television be cause when they see the television, they want to watch their favorite show. Staff must identify this learning impediment and train in an environment without a television). 6) Staff encourage clients to complete tasks with as much independence as possible. 7) Staff encourage clients to take risks while providing reasonable safeguards to prevent injury. 8) Encourage clients to make choices during their daily activities. W269 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.450(a)(1)(ii) Address the extent to which client choice will be accommodated in daily decision -making, emphasizing self -determination and self -management, to the extent possible; Guidance \u00a7483.450(a)(1)(ii) Written facility policies describe how the facility will offer choice to the clients during the course of their day. Written policies describe how self -determination, as defined by free choice of one's own acts and decisions without external coercion or direction, to the extent possible and self- management , as defined by control of one's own routine and daily responsibilities, to the extent possible, are incorporated into the development of program plans and daily routines. W270 (Rev. 135, -27-15) client conduct to be allowed or not allowed; and Guidance \u00a7483.450(a)(1)(iii) \"Client conduct\" refers to any behavior, choice, action, or activity in which a client may choose to engage alone or with others. Written policies and procedures which may be in the form of \"house rules\", must not impinge on individual client rights and must not be used as a substitute for the development of individualized programs and plans. W271 (Rev. 135, Issued: 04 -27-15) \u00a7483.450(a)(1)(iv) Be available to all staff, clients, parents of minor children, and legal guardians. Guidance \u00a7483.450(a)(1)(iv) Policies and procedures for management of conduct between staff and clients (483.450(a)(1)) shoul d be provided to clients, parents of minor children, and legal guardians at admission and upon request. Policies and procedures are available on the residential and program areas if these are in separate buildings. W272 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.450(a)(2) To the extent possible, clients must participate in the formulation of these policies and procedures. Guidance \u00a7483.450(a)(2) \"To the extent possible\" does not mean that the clients are exclu ded due to the clients' schedule or intellectual or developmental level. Facilities should be able to provide documentation that substantiates that clients were offered the opportunity and participated in the development of the policies. This could be ac complished through client committees or in house meetings. There should be documentation of these discussions between the client representatives and the facility. W273 (Rev. 135, Clients must not discipline other clients, except as part of an organized system of self -government, as set forth in facility policy. Guidance \u00a7483.450(a)(3) Staff will promptly intervene when any clients tries to independently impose discipline up on another client. For example, a client who is serving dessert to the group withholds dessert from another client based upon their own evaluation of that client's behavior. (b) Standard: Management of inappropriate client behavior W274 135, 04 -27-15) \u00a7483.450(b)(1) The facility must develop and implement written policies and procedures that govern the management of inappropriate client behavior Guidance \u00a7483.450(b)(1) At a minimum, the facility must have written policies and procedures regarding the management of maladaptive behaviors addressing the following: 483.450(b)(1) (W 275 - W284). the use of a functional behavior assessment in the development of behavior management programs; a hierarchy of least to most intrusive measures; and incorporation of behavior management programs into the IPP. \u00a7483.450(b)(1) These policies and procedures must be W275 (Rev. -27-15) \u00a7483.450(b)(1) consistent with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section. \u00a7483.450(b)(1) These procedures must W276 (Rev. -27-15) \u00a7483.450(b)(1)(i) all facility approved interventions to manage inappropriate client behavior; Guidance \u00a7483.450(b)(1)(i) All interventions for the management of inappropriate client behaviors which are approved for use in the facility are clearly stated and described in its policy. Examples of positive interventions include, but are not limited to, verbal praise reward systems, and prompting. Examples of negative interventions include, but are not limited to, removal of a privilege, implementation of restraint, and/or the use of exclusionary time out. W277 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.450(b)(1)(ii) Designate these interventions on a hierarchy to be implemented, ranging from most positive or least intrusive, to least positive or most intrusive; Guidance \u00a7483.450(b)(1)(ii) Policies and procedures must include a clear progression as to how staff implement interventions to manage inappropriate client behavior. Facility policy and procedures must define the entire hierarchy of possible interv entions from the most positive, functionally appropriate approaches to most intrusive approaches authorized. The facility determines at what level in the hierarchy the IPP will begin for each client based on their individual assessment. The plan must still begin at the least intrusive technique shown effective for that client. Individual plans should specify the specific techniques that have been determined through assessment to be least restrictive for each client. The facility policy for unexpected behav ioral incidents must provide direction for the staff in the utilization of the hierarchy. For clients not on a behavior plan, staff must apply the appropriate level of intervention per the established hierarchy, including emergency measures to prevent harm to self or others. W278 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.450(b)(1)(iii) Insure prior to the use of more restrictive techniques, that the client's record documents that programs incorporating the use of le ss intrusive or more positive techniques have been tried systematically and demonstrated to be ineffective; and Guidance \u00a7483.450(b)(1)(iii) Policies must be implemented to ensure that all restrictive procedures begin at the lowest level of the hierarchy unless there is documented evidence that less intrusive interventions have been tried and have been found to be ineffective. The facility is not required to justify dis continuing the use of a more restrictive technique before initiating a less restrictive technique, since the intent of the regulation is to use the most positive, least intrusive technique possible. In emergency situations where an unanticipated behavior requires immediate protection of the client or others, the technique chosen is the least restrictive appropriate technique possible. \u00a7483.450(b)(1)(iv) Address the following: -out rooms; Guidance \u00a7483.450(b)(1)(iv)(A) \"Time -out room\" is defined as a separate room that is used to remove a client from stimulation that may be triggering and reinforcing maladaptive behavior. The facility must have written policies and procedures for the use of time out rooms which address all the requirements of 483.450 (c) (1- 4) standard: time out room. physical restraints; Guidance \u00a7483.450(b)(1)(iv)(B) \"Physical restraint \" is defined as any manual hold or mechanical device that the client cannot remove easily, and which restricts the free movement of, normal functioning of, or normal access to a portion or portions of a client's body. Examples of mechanical devices may in clude arm splints and mittens. Policies and Procedures must address: the types of physical restraint that are allowed in the facility; the persons who apply such restraints; the parameters for duration of application; the methods that assure the health and safety of clients while in restraints; and the specific training required for staff allowed to apply such restraints. W281 (Rev. 135, of drugs to manage inappropriate behavior; Guidance \u00a7483.450(b)(1)(iv)(C) Applicable policies may include a discussion of: When a drug can be used to manage inappropriate behavior; Consistency with diagnosis; Alternatives tried before a drug is used; Precautions that must be followed prior to and during the use (lab value s, monitoring of side effects); Implementation of a plan to address the behaviors for which the drug was prescribed; and Plan to reduce the medication as appropriate. Drugs to manage inappropriate behavior are defined as any medication prescribed and administered for purposes of modifying the maladaptive behavior of a client. Guidance \u00a7483.450(b)(1)(iv)(D) \"Application of painful or noxious stimuli\" is defined as any procedure by which staff apply, contingent upon the exhibition of maladaptive behavior, st artling, unpleasant, or painful stimuli, or stimuli that have a potentially noxious effect. While the regulation permits the use of painful or noxious stimuli these techniques are the last resort and can only be utilized for behaviors that are causing sig nificant harm and have not responded to competently administered interventions of less intrusive nature. Facility policies must state that: The use of noxious stimuli is only permitted when the client exhibits behaviors so severe that they present a potential risk for significant or even life -threatening circumstances; the IDT and facility must weigh the potential risk of the behavior against the risk involved in the use of the painful or noxious techniques to manage behavior; that safeguards and strict oversight must be in place for consideration to use techniques that may be painful or even unpleasant; techniques that may be painful or noxious must be time limited; the proposed use of these techniques requires scrutiny of clinical effectiveness and specially constituted committee review; and on-going monitoring and safeguards must be in place during implementation of the technique. W283 (Rev. 135, staff memb ers who may authorize the use of specified interventions; Guidance \u00a7483.450(b)(1)(iv)(E) -27-15) \u00a7483.450(b)(1)(iv)(F) A mechanism for monitoring and controlling the use of interventions. Guidance \u00a7483.450(b)(1)(iv)(F) Facility policies must address what supervisory oversight is provided during the application of the intervention in order to ensure that procedures were followed correctly. Procedures should also address wha t retrospective analysis is done on each intervention to ensure that procedures are being consistently followed. W285 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.450(b)(2) Interventions to manage inappropriate client behavior must be employed with sufficient safeguards and supervision to ensure that the safety, welfare and civil and human rights of clients are adequately protected. \u00a7483.450(b)(3) Techniques to manage inappropriate client behavior must never be used W286 (Rev. 135, disciplinary purposes, Guidance \u00a7483.450(b)(3) No intervention, whether as a part of a formal program or in emergency situations (see W289) may be used as punishment, retaliation or retribution. A staff member cannot employ a behavior management technique simply because a client refuses to follow a staff request. The implementation of all interventions, except in emergency situations, must be administered consistent with the IPP and the specific behaviors identified in the IPP requiring the intervention. Instances where an intervention is done as a punishment because the client did not comply with staff instructions and not associated with the IPP include : Personal property confiscated for behavior at staff discretion; Rights restricted without approved plans; and Punitive house rules, such as prohibiting reentry into the kitchen for snacks if a meal is not eaten completely. W287 (Rev. 135, the convenience of staff Guidance \u00a7483.450(b)(3) Inadequate numbers of staff, inefficient deployment of staff, and insufficient training of staff can lead to restrictive practices used for staff convenience. Examples of techniques used to manage client behavior for staff convenience including, but are not limited to: Clients allowed to discipline other clients; Clients restricted to one area of the home; and Unauthorized use of r estraints (e.g., lap trays, bean bags, gait belt, and merry walkers for the purpose of restricting movement) W288 (Rev. -27-15) as a substitute for an active treatment progr am. Guidance \u00a7483.450(b)(3) Substitutions for active treatment programming occur when the staff utilizes interventions and restrictive techniques on their own, either because there is not a formal behavioral program to address the client's behaviors or b ecause the staff do not follow the plan as written. W289 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.450(b)(4) The use of systematic interventions to manage inappropriate client behavior must be incorporated into the client's individual program plan, in accordance with \u00a7483.440(c)(4) and (5) of this subpart. Guidance \u00a7483.450(b)(4) The use of behavior interventions are expected to be incorporated into the IPP and be based upon the results of the functional behavioral assessment. However, there may be isolated and rare instances when a client exhibits unexpected behavior that requires immediate intervention on the part of the staff. In these instances, the least restrictive intervention must be employed and removed as soon as the client is no longer an immediate threat to self or others. The IPP team must then discuss the need for adding a behavioral plan into the clients program. W290 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.450(b)(5) Standing or as needed programs to control inappropriate behavior are not permitted. Guidance \u00a7483.450(b)(5) The staff of the facility may not maintain or use, outside of the IPPs, any list of \"as needed\" interventions that can be used with any client at any time. With the exception of isolated and rare emergency situations, all restrictive behavior interventions must be incorporated into the formal IPP and individualized for the client. (c) Standard: Time -out rooms W291 (Rev. 135, Issue d: 02 -27-15, Effective: 04 -27-15, Implementation: 04 -27-15) \u00a7483.450(c)(1) A client may be placed in a room from which egress is prevented only if the following conditions are met: (i) The placement is a part of an approved systematic time -out program as required by paragraph (b) of this section. (Thus, emergency placement of a client into a time -out room is not allowed.) (ii) The client is under the direct constant visual supervision of designated staff. (iii) The door to the room is held shut by staff or by a mechanism requiring constant physical pressure from a staff member to keep the mechanism engaged. Guidance \u00a7483.450(c)(1) Seclusion, defined as the placement of a client alone in a locked room, is never allowed. Time out procedures allows a client to be alone in a room, but do not allow that room to be locked. During a time out procedure, egress can only be prevented by a person standing in the door way, or holding the door closed, but as soon as the staff move from the door way or let go of the door th e client can come out. Use of the timeout room or procedure must be part of an approved behavioral plan and may involve the separation of a client from a group or a particular situation, in a non -locked setting for the purpose of calming or removing the c lient from the reinforcing stimuli that are sustaining an identified maladaptive behavior. Designated time out rooms must be set up so that the staff has continuous, direct observation of the client at all times. Because of the danger that staff can get distracted by other events or duties, this cannot be accomplished by a camera in lieu of the staff having direct visual of the client. Key locks, latch locks, and doors that open inward without an inside doorknob are not permitted by the regulations for u se in time out rooms as they do not require constant physical pressure from a staff member to keep the door shut. In each instance where a time out room is used, the client's IPP must include: The functional behavioral assessment which resulted in a recom mendation for the use of time out procedures; and Instructions on how often data is to be collected during the time out period and the criteria for release from time out. The use of a time out room must be approved by the Specially constituted committee as part of an approved program. W292 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.450(c)(2) Placement of a client in a time -out room must not exceed one hour. W293 (Rev. 135, Issued: 04 -27-15) \u00a7483.450(c)(3) Clients placed in time -out rooms must be protected from hazardous conditions including, but not limited to, presence of sharp corners and objects, uncovered light fixtures, unprotected electrica l outlets. Guidance \u00a7483.450(c)(3) Because placement in the time out room is typically secondary to extreme behaviors, it is acceptable that there be no furniture in this room. A door that opens inward can potentially be held closed, either intentionall y or inadvertently, by the client in the room, thereby denying staff immediate access to the room. W294 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.450(c)(4) A record of time -out activities must be kept. Guidance \u00a74 83.450(c)(4) The documentation in the client's record accurately reflects planned (e.g. part of the IPP) usage and presents a picture of events prior to, during, and following the use of time -out. The IPP should include direction as to how often data must be collected during each use of time out for each individual client. (d) Standard: Physical restraints \u00a7483.450(d)(1) The facility may employ physical restraint only- - -27-15) \u00a7483.450(d)(1)(i) As an integral part of an individual program plan that is intended to lead to less restrictive means of managing and eliminating the behavior for which the restraint is applied; Guidance \u00a7483.450(d)(1)(i) The use of physical restraint is specified within the IPP. The plan must address: 1) The specific type of client behavior to be managed by this plan; 2) The less restrictive behavioral approaches which were previously used, but were unsuccessful; 3) The hierarchy of measures that must be util ized prior to the application of physical restraint; 4) The type of physical restraint; 5) The type of client behavior that would indicate that the patient is calm and can be released from the restraint; and 6) The replacement behavior being taught to the client to reduce the need for future restraints. W296 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.450(d)(1)(ii) As an emergency measure, but only if absolutely necessary to protect client or others from injury; or Guidance \u00a7483.450(d)(1)(ii) Physical restraint may be used as an emergency intervention only in situations where the client is exhibiting behaviors which: 1) the client has not exhibited before; 2) were not identified in the functional analysis of behavior; or 3) are harming other people or themselves. When there are repeated episodes of the use of physical restraint as an emergency safety measure, these episodes should be assessed for their predictability by the IDT, and revisions to the IPP considered addre ssing the behaviors through a formal behavior plan in order to reduce/eliminate the use of physical restraint. W297 (Rev. a health -related protection prescribed by a physician, but only if absolutely necessary during the conduct of a specific medical or surgical procedure, or only if absolutely necessary for client protection during the time that a medical condition exists. Guidance \u00a7483.450(d)(1)(iii) Physical restraint during medical procedures must be utilized only when absolutely necessary and be used as a last resort in order for the facility or practitioners to deliver needed medical care to the client. The restraint must be released as soon as the medical procedure is completed unless it is necessary to continue restraint for a longer period of time to continue to deliver care or to prevent the client from displacing tubes or dressings. These restraints may only be used as long as the physician indicates them to be necessary. For instances where physical restraint are used by the facility or a practitioner during a medical procedure, the client record and interviews should verify that less restrictive measures were attempted before using physical restraint and verify whether any injuries occurred during the use of the physical restraint. Written orders by medical personnel for the application of a physical restraint should include the reason that the restraint is necessary, the type of restraint to be us ed and the length of time the restraint will be applied. A restraint device used to prevent a client engaging in self -injurious behavior is not considered a restraint for medical condition. \u00a7483.450(d)(2) Authorizations to use or extend restraints as an emergency measure must be: Guidance \u00a7483.450(d)(2) Facility policies should list who in the facility is allowed to authorize the emergency use of restraints or to extend the use of an emergency restraint, and the training that is required for those perso ns who may authorize. Documentation in the client record in those instances should confirm that the facility follows that policy. W298 (Rev. 135, no longer than 12 consecutive hours; and Guidance \u00a7483.450(d)(2)(i) This regulation does not mean that restraints may be authorized to be applied for up to a 12 hour period. The client must be released from the physical restraint as soon as the client is no longer a risk to self or others. Once the behavior has ceased, the emergency has ended, and the client has been released, another authorization would be required for any new emergency situation. The 12 consecutive hour period is the absolute maximum period of tim e that emergency physical restraint may be utilized for a client during an individual behavioral incident. It is reasonable to expect that the facility will reassess the emergency situation for any client who remains in physical restraint for longer than one hour and reassess the situation at least every 30 minutes thereafter up to 12 hours when the physical restraint must be removed. W299 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.450(d)(2)(ii) Obtained as soon as the client is restrained or stable. Guidance \u00a7483.450(d)(2)(ii) There may be instances where the maladaptive behaviors of a client or clients escalate into a serious and immediate event that must be de -escalated quickly in order to prevent harm to client s, staff, other clients, or by standers when incidents occur in the community. In these instances, the staff should contact the appropriate person to obtain authorization for the use of physical restraint as soon as the situation is stable. Retrospective documentation of the incident should confirm the need for authorization after application. W300 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.450(d)(3) The facility must not issue orders for restraint on a standing or as needed basis. Guidance \u00a7483.450(d)(3) All instances of physical restraint must be ordered on a case by case basis with individual assessment of the situation and authorization based upon the individual client. Authorizations should include the rationa le for the use of the physical restraint versus other less restrictive measures. W301 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.450(d)(4) A client placed in restraint must be checked at least every 30 minutes by sta ff trained in the use of restraints, Guidance \u00a7483.450(d)(4) The frequency of monitoring will vary according to the type and design of the device and the psychological and physical well- being of the client. The facility should be checking the client often enough to adequately assess the physical status of the client (e.g., circulation, respiration and vital signs) of the client and the need to continued restraint. The more restrictive the intervention, the greater the risk to the client and the more often the client must be assessed. Frequent assessment will assure that the client will be released as soon as possible, however, in no instance may the staff go longer than 30 minutes without checking the client. W302 (Rev. 135, Issued: 02- 27-15, Effective : 04-27-15, Implementation: 04 -27-15) \u00a7483.450(d)(4) released from the restraint as quickly as possible, and Guidance \u00a7483.450(d)(4) \"As quickly as possible\" means as soon as the client is no longer a danger to self or others. Documentation should support that the client was released from restraint as soon as they became calm. W303 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.450(d)(4) a record of these checks and usage must be kept. \u00a7483.450(d)(5) Restraints mu st be designed and used W304 (Rev. -27-15) \u00a7483.450(d)(5) so as not to cause physical injury to the client Guidance \u00a7483.450(d)(5) Physical restraints to include mechanical devices must be the correct size for the client and be applied with the correct amount of pressure according to manufacturer's directions. In addition to observation of any physical mechanical restraint in use at the time of the survey, review incident reports for any in juries as a result of restraint use. W305 \u00a7483.450(d)(5) and so as to cause the least possible discomfort. \u00a7483.450(d)(6) Opportunity for motion and exercise must be provided W306 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.450(d)(6) for a period of not less than 10 minutes during each two hour period in which restraint is employed, Guidance \u00a7483.450(d)(6) This requirement does not apply to cases of medical restraints that are specifically ordered for the immobilization of bones and joints during the physical healing process involved with fractures, sprains, etc. (e.g. a broken bone immobilized by a cast or splint). See 331 483.460(c) regarding surveillance of skin integrity during the use of medical restraints. However, if a mechanical physical restraint is applied to an extremity to prevent a client from removing post -operative sutures, the restraint must be released every two (2) hours for a period of not less than ten (10) minutes in order to maintain adequate circulation. Mechanical restraints placed on the client during sleeping hours must be medically based and specifically ordered by a physician. There should be evidence in the client's record why the mechanical physical restraint is necessary du ring sleeping hours. While it is not necessary to wake the client every two (2) hours to release the restraint and provide opportunity for exercise, the staff must check the restraint frequently during the night to ensure that the restraint is still prope rly applied and the client appears comfortable. W307 (Rev. -27-15) \u00a7483.450(d)(6) a record of such activity must be kept. \u00a7483.450(d)(7) Barred enclosures Guidance \u00a7483.450(d)(7) A bed o r play equipment with bars that prevent the client from leaving the bed or voluntarily climbing out of the bed are barred enclosures. The use of such enclosures must be a part of the written IPP and behavioral assessments must clearly state why such an en closure is necessary, the risks of using the enclosure versus not using it and what less restrictive measures have been tried prior to the implementation of the barred enclosures. Such devices may not be used in lieu of adequate staffing. W308 (Rev. 135, Issued: 02 -27-15, Effective: 04 -27-15, Implementation: 04 -27-15) \u00a7483.450(d)(7) must not be more than three feet in height and W309 (Rev. 135, (e) Standard: Drug usage Drug -27-15) \u00a7483.450(e)(1) The facility must not use drugs in doses that interfere with the individual client's daily living act ivities. Guidance \u00a7483.450(e)(1) Clients are alert and available for participation in daily living activities. Some medications administered for medical reasons or to manage behavior may cause drowsiness as a side effect or due to an accumulation of the drug in the client's system. For clients who are observed to be sleeping in chairs during their work day, their programs or recreational times, there should be evidence that the facility staff notified the medical staff and an assessment was performed of the client including their medication regimen. Medical staff should make adjustments to address the issue if indicated. \u00a7483.450(e)(2) Drugs used for control of inappropriate behavior must W311 (Rev. 135, by the interdisciplinary team and Guidance \u00a7483.450(e)(2) The physician and other team members discuss the risks and benefits of the medication to address the target behavior/symptoms, and approve th e use of the drug as being consistent with the active treatment program. Decisions about the necessity of the use of drugs to manage inappropriate behavior should be made by the IDT. It is the responsibility of the IDT members to provide the physician wit h sufficient information regarding the need for a client to receive a drug for inappropriate behavior. The physician will make the ultimate decision to order the use of the drug. The IDT should document any disagreement with the physician's order. In th ose instances where a client returns from a physician's visit with an order for an unsolicited drug to manage client's inappropriate behaviors, there must be evidence (e.g. IDT meeting notes or clients record) that the team concurred with the necessity for the order without trying less restrictive measures first and discussed any concerns with the physician. W312 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.450(e)(2) as an integral part of the client's indi vidual program plan that is directed specifically towards the reduction of and eventual elimination of the behaviors for which the drugs are employed. Guidance \u00a7483.450(e)(2) All medications to manage behavior must be integrated into the IPP and the IPP must specify how the specific target behavior for which the medication is prescribed will be reduced or eliminated. This includes medications which are typically used for medical conditions that may be used to manage behavior (e.g. 1. propranolol (Inderal ), an antihypertensive used 2. carbamazepine (Tegretol), an anticonvulsant, used for aggression). Drugs for behavior management must not be ordered on a PRN basis for a client. The facility staff must contact the physicia n to obtain a one -time order if the situation necessities the use of medication. The facility policy must address the maximum number of times a medication can be used as an emergency prior to being incorporated in the IPP, side effects of such medications , and the frequency of re -evaluation of ongoing behavior and its treatment. Clients or their legal guardian have the right to choose sedation for medical and dental procedures. However, the facility cannot do routine administration of medication for sedation for medical and dental procedures without the agreement/consent of the client or their parent/legal guardian and they must follow the specific orders of the healthcare practitioner who will be providing services to the client. Decisions to order medi cations prior to medical and dental procedures must be made on an individual basis. Clients who demonstrate severe anxiety around these procedures should be considered for desensitization programs. W313 (Rev. 135, 04 -27-15) \u00a7483.450(e)(3) Drugs used for control of inappropriate behavior must not be used until it can be justified that the harmful effects of the behavior clearly outweigh the potentially harmful effects of the drugs. Guidance \u00a7483.450(e)(3) The risk(s) associated with the drug being used is consistent with the type and severity of the behavior/symptoms it is intended to affect. At the time the drug was started and incorporated into the IPP, the behaviors were discussed and pr esented to team members. It was the documented decision of the team that the behaviors were of such a severity that pharmacological intervention was required and the physician was provided with the team information to assist him in his decision to prescribe the medication. \u00a7483.450(e)(4) Drugs used for control of inappropriate behavior must be - - \u00a7483.450(e)(4)(i) Monitored closely, W314 (Rev. -27-15) \u00a7483.450(e)(4) in conjunction with the physician and the drug regimen review requirement at \u00a7483.460(j), Guidance \u00a7483.450(e)(4) The physician and pharmacist must regularly review use of drugs for control of inappropriate behavior for their effectiveness in changing the targeted behavior/symp toms, untoward side effects, contraindications for continued use, and communicate this information to relevant staff. W315 (Rev. 135, -27-15) desired responses and adverse consequences by facility staff; and Guidance \u00a7483.450(e)(4) Direct support staff members are the people who most closely and most frequently observe and record client behaviors. There should be evidence that the direct support staff receive information via the IPP as to the behaviors to be observed, the side effects associated with the medication, the amount and types of documentation required and the communication with clinical staff which is indicated. See 483.430 (e)(1) for training on observations, docum entation and communication related to behavior management. \u00a7483.450(e)(4)(ii) Gradually (Rev. least annually Guidance \u00a7483.450(e)(4) Clients receiving medications to control behavior must be evaluated at least annually for a possible reduction of the medication progressing the client toward final elimination of the drug or lowest possible therapeutic level of the drug. However, evaluation should be d one earlier than annually if observations indicate that the client's behavior has improved to the point that reduction may be considered as determined by the IPP, unless otherwise ordered by the client's physician. W317 (Rev. 135, 04 -27-15) \u00a7483.450(e)(4) in a carefully monitored program conducted in conjunction with the interdisciplinary team, unless clinical evidence justifies that this is contraindicated. Guidance \u00a7483.450(e)(4) The IDT is aware of and involved in planning the drug reduction program and participates in its implementation and monitoring. Progress or regression of the client is monitored and taken into consideration in determining the rate of withdrawal and whether to continue with drawal. In determining whether there is clinical contraindication to the annual drug withdrawal, the physician and IDT should consider the client's clinical history, diagnostic/behavioral status, previous reduction/discontinuation attempts, and current regimen effectiveness. If a client also has a diagnosis of a psychiatric condition that requires a stable level of a psychiatric medication in order to control the symptoms associated with the psychiatric diagnosis, the annual evaluation for reduction of that particular medication for the symptoms of the psychiatric diagnosis would not apply. Documentation in the client's record from their psychiatrist or physician that medication reduction would be contraindicated or that the current level of medications is therapeutic meets the intent of this regulation. W318 (Rev. 135, Health care Standard: W319 Implementation: 04 -27-15) \u00a7483.460(a)(1) The facility must ensure the availability of physician services 24 hours a day. Guidance \u00a7483.460(a)(1) A designated physician must be available via telephone, pager, e -mail or on -site in the facility on a 24 hour per day basis for consultation regarding both emergency and non -emergency medical issues. If the facility employs a fulltime physician, there must be procedures in place for coverage in the absence of the physician from t he facility. If the facility contracts with a community -based physician for 24 hour per day coverage, there must be written arrangements in place to detail the responsibilities of the contract physician regarding direct services to the clients, interactio ns with the direct support staff and the interactions between the nursing staff of the facility and the contract physician. The contract with the contract physician must delineate the process for coverage when he/she is not available. Upon interview, the staff should be aware of the procedures they are to follow to contact a physician in the event of an illness or injury. Routinely sending clients to emergent care or the emergency room of a hospital because there are no facility physicians available for consultation is not consistent with the regulations. Interview and record review verify that the physician is available and responsive 24 hours a day. W320 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.460(a)(2) The physician must develop, in coordination with licensed nursing personnel, a medical care plan of treatment for a client if the physician determines that an individual client requires 24 -hour licensed nursing care. Guidance \u00a7483.460(a)(2) A medical care p lan of treatment is developed for those clients who are either acutely ill and require licensed nursing care and monitoring temporarily on a 24 hour basis or clients whose chronic medical conditions require or indicate 24 hour licensed nursing care and m onitoring. The physician determines when 24 hour nursing care is required. The medical care plan is based upon the orders from the physician for treatments and care and nursing standards of practice. There is evidence in the client's record that the phy sician and the nursing staff at the facility work together to ensure that the medical care plan is current and appropriate (e.g. changes in physician written orders for care pursuant to observations from the nursing staff and/or direct observations and in teractions with the client, and nursing documentation of care). The fact that a client has a medical care plan in place should not preclude him/her from an active treatment program, except in instances of acute illness where the active treatment program is temporarily suspended. For clients with chronic medical conditions, it may be necessary for their active treatment program to be modified due to the tolerance level of the client or adapted to accommodate medical limitations. However, active treatment must be provided on a continuous basis. W321 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.460(a)(2) This plan must be integrated in the individual program plan. Guidance \u00a7483.460(a)(2) Although the medical care plan can be a separate document, it is always an integral part of the IPP process. There should be evidence that the plans are shared and discussed at the time of all interdisciplinary discussions and the information from the med ical care plan is utilized in the development of the IPP objectives. \u00a7483.460(a)(3) The facility must provide or obtain W322 (Rev. 09-16) \u00a7483.460(a)(3) The facility must provide or obtain preventive and general care Guidance \u00a7483.460(a)(3) The facility has procedures in place to ensure that the clients receive general health care services to assure optimal levels of wellness. General health care services include assessment and treatment of acute and chronic complaints or situations; teaching relevant heath care principles to staff and clients; and periodic surveillance of the health status of the clients. As a result of clinical assessment, referrals are made for specialized assessment and tests. Facility health care staff follow -up to ensure the assessments are done and the findings incorporated into the medical care plan and/or the IPP. The facility must have arrangements in place to provide routine or episodic laboratory, and radiology services for the clients if not provided in -house or through the clients physician. There must be a written agreement that specifies the responsibilities of the facility and outside provider. (See \u00a7483.410(a)). Preventive health care services include s creening procedures designed to identify health concerns and initiate treatment as early as possible. The facility should have a health prevention program in place and follow the plan to address those screenings that the facility will perform periodically that are relevant to all clients, and those screenings associated with a particular gender or age or vulnerability. Physician refusal to perform a test, such as a pap smear, must be consistent with guidelines for clients, per the local standard in the co mmunity. If the facility has a physician that refuses to provide preventative healthcare based on the client's level of functioning, medical staff at the facility should meet with and consult with this physician in order to ensure that clients receive the same health services as persons living in the local community. Current recommended screenings for men and women can be accessed at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). \u00a7483.460(a)(3) as well as annual physical examinations of each client that at a minimum include the following: W323 (Rev. and hearing; Guidance \u00a7483.460(a)(3)(i) Information relevant to the client's ability to see and hear is a critical component in the development of appropriate active treatment strategies. All clients, including clients who ar e non -verbal, should have evidence in his/her record that they receive an annual evaluation of their vision and hearing which includes a screening as a minimum, follow -up examination as indicated by the screen and timely referrals as indicated by the exami nation. Screening is a gross assessment of the client's vision and hearing and usually does not include a measurement of acuity. Examinations are conducted to follow -up on issues noted in the screening and are conducted by qualified professionals. Clien ts who appear to have vision or hearing problems or the staff indicate that they have vision or hearing problems and no accommodations have been made. The annual vision and hearing evaluation verifies that clients appearing to have vision/hearing issues o r if staff indicate that a client has vision/hearing issues that these issues have been/are being addressed. If a client's vision or hearing can only be assessed through examinations conducted by specialists (e.g., comprehensive ophthalmological examinati ons and evoked response audiometry (ERA)), these tests need not be conducted yearly, but rather upon the specialist's expressed recommendations. During discussions at the annual IPP review the team reviews information from the health professional, speech and hearing professional, and direct support staff and makes referrals back to the specialist if indicated. W324 (Rev. 158, using as a guide the recommendations of the Public Health Service Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Committee on the Control of Infectious Diseases of the American Academy of Pediatrics; Guidance \u00a7483.460(a)(3)(ii) These immunization guides may be obtained from the American Academy of Pediatrics and/or the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). W325 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.460(a)(3)(iii) Routine screening laboratory examinations as determined necessary b y the physician, Guidance \u00a7483.460(a)(3)(iii) The facility may have a set of routine laboratory tests which are to be done on every client annually which is developed and approved by the facility physician. However, such a list is not required. The physician may write orders individually for the clients based upon their medical history, age, gender or medical vulnerabilities. W326 (Rev. control, appropriate to the facility's population, and in accordance with the recommendations of the American College of Chest Physicians or the section on diseases of the chest of the American Academy of Pediatrics, or both. Guidance \u00a7483.460(a)(3)(iv) The facility should have in place a system for the identification, reporting, investigation, and control of Tuberculosis (TB) i n order to prevent its transmission within the facility. This system should include: 1) Policies and procedures for screening new employees, new clients, and other people who interact on a consistent basis with clients residing in the facility when those persons are volunteers or professional staff hired or utilized directly by the facility (such as volunteers and contract professional staff); 2) Policies and procedures for subsequent screening for clients and for employees, and other people (such as volunteers and contract professional staff) who interact on a consistent basis with clients residing in the facility when those persons are volunteers or professional staff hired or utilized directly by the facility per State Health Department requirements; 3) Polic ies and procedures for reporting positive TB test results to the appropriate State authorities; 4) Policies for the investigative procedures, per the local health department, that would be put in place should a client or staff person test positive for TB; 5) Policies and procedures for treatment and precautions to be used with clients who display TB symptoms, as substantiated by positive skin testing or x -ray results; and 6) Policies and procedures for the evaluation of the effectiveness of the surveillance system. When one or more clients or staff display TB symptoms, as substantiated by positive skin testing or x-ray results, they do not return to work until a physician has cleared them to return to work. W328 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.460(a)(4) To the extent permitted by State law, the facility may utilize physician assistants and nurse practitioners to provide physician services as described in this section. Guidance \u00a7483.460(a)(4) Refer to the applicable State Nurse Practice Act or applicable Board of Medicine Practice Act to determine the extent that the nurse practitioner or physician assistant may provide physician services. (b) Standard: Physician participation in the individual program plan \u00a7483.460(b) A physician must participate in- W329 (Rev. establishment of each newly admitted client's initial individual program plan as required by \u00a7456.380 o f this chapter that specifies plan of care requirements for ICFs; and Guidance \u00a7483.460(b)(1) During the admission process, which takes place from the time the client is admitted to the facility to the time the initial IPP is completed, a physician is re quired to ensure that an assessment of the client's medical status is thoroughly considered and incorporated into the IPP planning process by the team as it develops the IPP. The physician's input may be by means of written reports, evaluations, and recom mendations. The physician (consistent with Medicaid Utilization Control regulations at \u00a7456.380) must evaluate the client at the time of admission to identify all diagnoses and complaints, provide orders for all medications and treatments and provide reco mmendations for restorative and rehabilitative services. \u00a7456.380 requires that a physician conduct this initial assessment therefore, it may not be done by a physician extender ( e.g., Physician assistant or Advanced Practice Registered Nurse). (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.460(b)(2) If appropriate, physicians must participate in the review and update of an individual program plan as part of the interdisciplinary team process either in person or through written report to the interdisciplinary team. Guidance \u00a7483.460(b)(2) The need for physician participation on an individual client's IPP team is determined by the medical needs of the client. How the physician participates (whether through writ ten report, telephone consultation, attendance at the meeting, etc.) is to be left to the discretion of the facility. In instances where a client has no overriding medical issues, the nurse of the facility can represent the medical component on the IDT pr ocess or consult with the appropriate physician and share the information with the team. However, in situations where a client's medical condition is unstable/fragile to the extent that it impacts the training/work that may be planned, the physician must participate in providing guidance on the types and extent of programs that would be appropriate considering the client's physical/medical limitations. If a client is noted to be having difficulty participating in the objectives set forth in his/her IPP due to serious medical concerns, review the input that was provided by the physician into the development of the plan and whether the IPP team requested such input. (c) Standard: Nursing services W331 The facility must provide clients with nursing services in accordance with their needs. Guidance \u00a7483.460(c) The nurse responds in a timely manner to all medical concerns reported, conducts assessments as indicated, effects timely and appropriate interventions, communicates with the client's physicians and other health care professionals as indicated, provides treatments as ordered, monitors client progress following illness or injury and provides training to clients and /or staff as indicated. \u00a7483.460(c) These services must include W332 (Rev. -27-15) \u00a7483.460(c)(1) Participation as appropriate in the development, review, and update of an individual program plan as part of the interdisciplinary team process; Guidance \u00a7483.460(c)(1) For those clients who have had an uneventful year medically and have no medical/health concerns at the time of the IPP meeting the facility nurse may submit a summary report to the IDT unless the IDT determines that his/her attendance is necessary. An eventful year medically would include a year which required unplanned hospital admissions or in which medical issues necessitated treatment for a prolonged or continuing period. Ho wever when a client has had an eventful year medically or current medical/health concerns, this could have an impact on their objectives and accordingly the nurse should participate in the IDT discussion directly. W333 (Rev. 135, The development, with a physician, of a medical care plan of treatment for a client when the physician has determined that an individual client requires such a plan; Guidance \u00a7483.460(c)(2) A medical care plan addresses those clinical treatments and observations that are to be done for the client by the medical staff and other staff of the facility in order to either improve an acute medical condition or to maintain a medically fragile client as clinically stable as possible. The medical care plan is an adjunct to the IPP and is not considered a substitution for the IPP. \u00a7483.460(c)(3) For those clients certified as not needing a medical care plan, a review of their health status which must - W334 (Rev. 135, a direct physical examination; Guidance \u00a7483.460(c)(3)(i) A direct physical examination means a visual review of the body as well as examination/assessment of body systems. This includes observations made through non -verbal communication (including visual, tactile, nonverbal gestures, grimaces, etc.) which may b e an indication that there is a potential for further assessment and/or monitoring. A paper review of the client's medical record and health statistics does not meet the intent of the regulation for a direct physical examination. W335 (Rev. 135, Issued: 02-27-15, Effective: 04 nurse; Guidance \u00a7483.460(c)(3)(ii) The term \"licensed nurse\", for purposes of these guidelines, means a registered nurse, a licensed practical nurse or a licen sed vocational nurse currently licensed by the State in which the facility is located. The nurse must operate consistent with the requirements of the applicable Nurse Practice Act. If this direct physical examination is done by a physician, it is not necessary for the nurse to repeat the exam.

Health and wellness are actively promoted, problems are attended to before they negatively impact the client's health and wellness, and steps are taken to prevent the recurrence of such problems while responding promptly to client's needs. Client health care complaints that are reported either directly by the client or by the direct care staff are addressed promptly by the nursing staff. Client health care complaints and response by nursing staff are documented in the client's record. \u00a7483.460(c)(5) Implementing with other members of the interdisciplinary team, appropriate protective and preventive health measures that include, but are not limited to - - W340 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.460(c)(5)(i) Training clients and staff as needed in appropriate health and hygiene methods; Guidance \u00a7483.460(c)(5)(i) Nursing staff periodically provides training to clients and staff on how to care for health needs or conditions, personal hygiene, health maintenance, and disease prevention. Nursing staff actively participates in periodic discussions with client and staff to promote health habits in the areas of diet, exercise and non -smoking. Based upon individual training needs, the nursing staff provides training to individuals in areas such as medications, family planni ng, prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, control of other infectious diseases, self -monitoring of health status and self- prevention of health problems, etc. The nurses may train clients directly on their objectives or train other staff to do this training as appropriate. W341 (Rev. 135, of communicable diseases and infections, including the instruction of other personnel in methods of infection control; and Guidance \u00a7483.460(c)(5)(ii) Nursing staff should actively participate in surveillance and reporting of communicable diseases per the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines and applicable state laws. They should teach and promote infection control techniques such as hand washing by clients and staff and should be making periodic observations to ensure that such good infection control techniques are consistently utilized. W342 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.460(c)(5)(iii) Training direct care staff in detecting signs and symptoms of illness or dysfunction, first aid for accidents or illness, and basic skills required to meet the health needs of the clients. Guidance \u00a7483.460(c)(5)(iii) Nursing sta ff must train and ensure direct support staff demonstrate competency in detecting signs and symptoms of illness, injury, or change in the client's health baseline (e.g. responsiveness, fatigue, irritability, constipation, diarrhea, dehydration, confusion, unexplained weight loss, changes in endurance and changes in respiratory function). Staff is responsive to health care needs or injuries of clients and receives instruction and support during temporary illness of clients. If not, review staff training re cords to determine whether training was provided periodically to the involved employee. Interview direct care staff to determine their level of understanding regarding the signs and symptoms of illness that are to be reported to the medical staff. The records of clients with recent hospitalizations verify that staff detected and reported relevant symptoms promptly. (d) Standard: Nursing staff W343 (Rev. -27-15) \u00a7483.460(d)(1) Nurses providing services in the facility must have a current license to practice in the State. Guidance \u00a7483.460(d)(1) The facility should have a procedure in place to ensure that any contract nursing staff members are currently licensed prior to the provision of services. Include any contract nurses used by the facility in the sample of nurses reviewed for licensure. W344 (Rev. -27-15) \u00a7483.460(d)(2) The facility must employ or arrange for licensed nursing services sufficient to care for clients' health needs including those clients with medical care plans. Guidance \u00a7483.460(d)(2) The facility provides for nursing services based on th e health needs and conditions of clients residing there. Examples include: 1) physician ordered treatments that require the skills of a licensed nurse; 2) preventive screenings ; 3) assessment and intervention; 4) direct physical examination and examination of body systems; 5) teaching; and 6) advocacy for the medical services needed by the client. Client health care needs are met in a timely manner (within 24 hours) by the available nursing staff. If nurses who do not have experience in the care of persons with intellec tual disabilities are employed by the facility, they should be provided with a formal orientation period and on -going educational opportunities to increase their understanding of the client population. When one or more clients in the facility has an activ e medical care plan, there must be 24 hour nursing services available to come to the facility as needed to make skilled assessments and interventions. W345 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.460(d)(3) The facility must utilize registered nurses as appropriate and required by State law to perform the health services specified in this section. Guidance \u00a7483.460(d)(3) Refer to the applicable State Nurse Practice Act. W346 (Rev. 135, Issued: 04 -27-15) \u00a7483.460(d)(4) If the facility utilizes only licensed practical or vocational nurses to provide health services, it must have a formal arrangement with a registered nurse to be available for verbal or onsite consul tation to the licensed practical or vocational nurse. Guidance \u00a7483.460(d)(4) The facility must have written arrangements with a registered nurse (RN) to provide consultation in those instances where LPNs/LVNs provide all the direct nursing care for the clients. Verify that the agreement requires the RN to respond promptly to all calls from the LPN/LVN and to come on -site to the facility if necessary. The facility must also ensure registered nurse back -up when the primary registered nurse consultant is unavailable (vacations, etc.). Review documentation in the client records to confirm that the LPNs/LVNs of the facility are consulting the registered nurse consultant when indicated and that she/he responds promptly to such calls. W347 (Rev. Effective: 04 -27-15, Implementation: 04 -27-15) \u00a7483.460(d)(5) Non - licensed nursing personnel who work with clients under a medical care plan must do so under the supervision of licensed persons. The work of any direct support staff (caring fo r clients with a medical care plan) is directed by an onsite licensed nurse). The nurse evaluates the care provided by the staff as needed, but at least each shift. If observations of care indicate that direct care staff are not providing care as directe d by the medical care plan, then review the supervision provided by the nursing staff. (e) Standard: Dental services W348 (Rev. -27-15) \u00a7483.460(e)(1) The facility must provide or make arrangements for comprehensive diagnostic and treatment services for each client from qualified personnel, including licensed dentists and dental hygienists either through organized dental services in- house or through arrangement. Guidance \u00a7483.460(e)(1) It is expected that the clients will obtain dental services (both diagnostic and treatment) from community dentists whenever possible.

There are no instances where a client does not receive needed medications due to the unavailability of drugs. (j) Standard: Drug regimen review W362 (Rev. t with input from the interdisciplinary team must review the drug regimen of each client at least quarterly. Guidance \u00a7483.460(j)(1) The primary function of the pharmacist during the quarterly drug review is to identify possible drug interactions, check for evidence of any side effects associated with the drug usage, determine if laboratory results associated with the drug are within normal limits and verify that the facility is administering the medication appropriately and to comment upon the efficacy o f the drug use (e.g. blood sugar controlled, blood pressure within normal limits). In the case of drugs used to manage behavior, the pharmacist may need information from the IDT to determine efficacy. See Appendix PP, Indicators for Surveyor Assessment o f the Performance of Drug Regimen Reviews, to the State Operations Manual (Pharmaceutical Service Requirements in Long Term Care Facilities). W363 (Rev. 135, ust report any irregularities in clients' drug regimens to the prescribing physician and interdisciplinary team. Guidance \u00a7483.460(j)(2) The physician and IDT members must discuss, document and take necessary follow -up action for any irregularities noted . W364 \u00a7483.460(j)(3) The pharmacist must prepare a record of each client's drug regimen reviews and the facility must maintain that record. W365 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.460(j)(4) An individual medication administration record must be maintained for each client. W366 (Rev. 135, appropriate the pharmacist must participate in the development, implementation, and review of each client's individual program plan either in person or through written report to the interdisciplinary team. Guidance \u00a7483.460(j)(5) Pharmacist participation on the IDT is at the request of the team. It would not be necessary for the pharma cist to routinely attend all team meetings when the client is on a stable drug regimen that does not appear to be influencing his/her active treatment programs. Pharmacist participation may be appropriate, in situations such as assisting the IDT develop t he most effective training programs for when the client is in an evolving situation with their medication. For example: A client begins a new or more complex drug regimen; The physician orders off- label use of a medication; Frequent changes in the drug r egimen are affecting IPP implementation. (k) Standard: Drug administration -27-15) \u00a7483.460(k) The facility must have an organized system for drug administration that identifies each drug up to the point of administration. \u00a7483.460(k) The system must assure that W368 (Rev. administered in compliance with the physician's orders; Guidance \u00a7483.460(k)(1) Administration errors identified in previous medication administration records qualify as non - compliance with physician's orders. W369 (Rev. 135, 04 All drugs, including those that are self -administered, are administered without error; Guidance \u00a7483.460(k)(2) A medication error is an observed discrepancy during the medicati on pass between what is ordered and what is administered. This also applies to self- administered medications. For small facilities (16 beds or less), the medication administration pass will encompass a total of eight (8) drug doses. The observations should be split between two separate drug passes 4/4 (one in the morning and one in the late afternoon or early evening). The medications observed during the observations may or may not be for clients in the survey sample. Any concerns regarding a medication that is about to be administered should be brought to the attention of the person administering the medication. The record of observation should be reconciled with the most current signed physician's orders. For large facilities (17 or more beds) with either single or multiple buildings, the medication administration pass will encompass a total of 12 doses. The observations should be split between two separate passes 6/6 (one in the morning and one in late afternoon or early evening). Any concerns regarding a medication that is about to be administered should be brought to the attention of the person administering the medication. The record of observation should be reconciled with the most current signed physician's orders. W370 (Rev. 135, Issued : 02-27-15, Effective: 04 -27-15, Implementation: 04 -27-15) \u00a7483.460(k)(3) Unlicensed personnel are allowed to administer drugs only if State law permits; Guidance \u00a7483.460(k)(3) Unlicensed personnel administer only those forms of medication which state l aw permits. Licensed nurse(s) in the facility oversee any administration of medications by unlicensed persons and periodically evaluate their performance. W371 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.460(k)(4) Clients are taught to administer their own medications if the interdisciplinary team determines that self -administration of medications is an appropriate objective, and if the physician does not specify otherwise; Guidance \u00a7483.460(k)(4) The IDT decision th at a self -administration program is appropriate, as is the case for all formal training objectives, must be based upon accurate, current, valid assessment of the client's skills and potential. The determination as to the appropriateness of a self- administ ration program must never be made singularly on the client's diagnosis or current functional abilities. For clients assessed to be inappropriate for a self- administration program, but determined by the IDT to possess the capacity to functionally, cognitively, emotionally or developmentally benefit from participation in the drug administration process, it is expected that the facility will provide opportunities for the client to participate in the medication administration process under direct supervision. This participation can include but is not limited to, identifying the medication taken, reaching/graspin g a cup of water during the process and placing oral medications in the mouth, etc. W372 (Rev. 135, informed of the interdisciplinary team's decision that self-administration of medications is an objective for the client; Guidance \u00a7483.460(k)(5) While the IDT may set an objective of self administration of medication for a client, they are required to notify the client's physician of this pro posed objective. If the client's physician objects on medical grounds, the team must not proceed with the objective until such time as a discussion is held with the physician and he/she agrees to proceed after receiving additional information. W373 (Rev. 135, Issued: 02 -27-15, Effective: -27-15) \u00a7483.460(k)(6) No client self -administers medication until he or she demonstrates the competency to do so; Guidance \u00a7483.460(k)(6) The written self -administration program for a client must detail the criteria that will be employed by the facility staff to verify that the client successfully completes all phases of the program and continues to comply with all necessary requirements for self administration. Clients who self- administer m edications must secure all medications in such a manner as to protect access by other clients or visitors. W374 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.460(k)(7) Drugs used by clients while not under the direct ca re of the facility are packaged and labeled in accordance with State law; Guidance \u00a7483.460(k)(7) When clients go out of the facility for home visits, or to attend work or school, drugs they are taking must be packaged and labeled in accordance with sta te law by a person authorized by state law to package and label. \u00a7483.460(k)(8) Drug administration errors and adverse drug reactions are Guidance \u00a7483.460(k)(8) Documentation of any medication error should be entered into the client's record and should include what error was made, who was notified of the error, the response of the medical person notified, the physical condition of the client at the time of the notification and subsequent observations of the clients physical condition related to th e error. W375 (Rev. 135, Guidance \u00a7483.460(k)(8) Documentation of adverse drug reactions must be entered into the client's record and should include all complaint s made by the client or observations made by the staff following the drug administration, the notification of medical personnel, and the response of the medical personnel, any emergency actions that were required and all subsequent observations of the client's condition related to the reaction. W376 (Rev. immediately to a physician. Guidance \u00a7483.460(k)(8) \"Immediately\" means at the time the error or reaction is identified. (l) Standard: Drug storage and recordkeeping \u00a7483.460(l)(1) The facility must store drugs under proper conditions of Guidance \u00a7483.460(l)(1) Drugs are stored according to manufacturer's recommendations.

W382 \u00a7483.460(l)(2) The facility must keep all drugs and biologicals locked except when being prepared for administration. W383 (Rev. -27-15) \u00a7483.460(l)(2) Only authorized persons may have access to the keys to the drug storage area. Guidance \u00a7483.460(l)(2) \"Authorized persons\" is restricted to those who administer the drugs (as allowed by state law) and nursing su pervisors (if any). No other personnel should have access to these keys. W384 (Rev. 135, who have been trained to self -administer drugs in accordance with \u00a7483.460(k)(4) may have access to keys to their individual drug supply. Guidance \u00a7483.460(l)(2) Drugs that are self- administered do not have to be double locked. The purpose for the double locking is to limit access to scheduled drugs. Since the client is generally the only one who has access to his/her drug supply (with perhaps the exception of a licensed nurse or whoever has overall responsibility for medication administration at the facility and a facility's Director of Nursing Services, who may have access to all of the facility's drug supplies), there is no need to further limit access. W385 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.460(l)(3) The facility must maintain records of the receipt and disposition o f all controlled drugs. Guidance \u00a7483.460(l)(3) The facility must follow state requirements for the control and disposition of controlled drugs. W386 (Rev. 135, -27-15) \u00a7483.460(l)(4) The facility must, on a sample basis, periodically reconcile the receipt and disposition of all controlled drugs in schedules II through IV (drugs subject to the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 21 U.S.C. 801 et seq., as implemented by 21 CFR Part 308). Guidance \u00a7483.460(l)(4) The facility should follow state requirements for the reconciliation of controlled drugs. W387 \u00a7483.460(l)(5) If the facility maintains a licensed pharmacy, the facility must comply with the regulations for controlled drugs \u00a7483.460(m) Standard: Drug Labeling \u00a7483.460(m)(1) Labeling of drugs and biologicals must W388 \u00a7483.460(m)(1)(i) Be based on currently accepted professional principles and practices; and W389 \u00a7483.460(m)(1)(ii) Include the appropriate accessory and cautionary instructions, as well as the expiration date, if applicable. \u00a7483.460(m)(2) The facility must remove from use -- W390 \u00a7483.460(m)(2)(i) Outdated drugs; and W391 \u00a7483.460(m)(2)(ii) Drug containers with and biologicals packaged in containers designated for a particular client must be immediately removed from the clien t's current medication supply if discontinued by the physician.

Guidance \u00a7483.460(n)(1) If the facility performs laboratory services, it must have a current, valid Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) certificate for the types of tests it is performing. For the purposes of this regulation, a \"laboratory service or test\" is defined as any examination or analysis of materials derived from the human body for purposes of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatm ent of any disease or impairment of, or the assessment of the health of human beings. W394 (Rev. 158, 09-16) \u00a7483.460(n)(2) If the laboratory chooses to refer specimens for testing to another laboratory, the referral laboratory must be certified in the appropriate specialties and subspecialties of service in accordance with the requirements of part 493 of this chapter. Guidance \u00a7483.460(n)(2) A facility performing any laboratory service or test must have applied to CMS, and received a Certificate of Waiver, Certificate of Compliance, or Certificate of Accreditation. An application for a Certificate of Waiver may be made if the facility performs only those tests on the waived list. A complete list of waived tests can be accessed at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). If the facility performs any test, not appearing on the waived list, a Certificate of Com pliance or Certificate of Accreditation is required. An appropriate CLIA certificate is required regardless of the frequency with which the laboratory services or tests are conducted. When no tests are performed, a CLIA certificate is not needed. Facilities only collecting specimens and not performing testing do not need a certificate. A not -for-profit, a state, or local government organization may have one certificate covering all the facilities it operates (e.g., all the separately certified residences which fall under its governing body), if no more than a total of 15 types of waived or moderately complex laboratory tests are used. This exception applies only to laboratories performing limited public health testing. See State Operations Manual (SOM) 6008. Each location where a laboratory tests are performed must file a separate application to be separately certified unless the laboratory meets one if the exceptions outlined at 42CFR493.35(b), 493.443(b), or 493.55(b). Any laboratory located in a st ate that has a CMS -approved laboratory program is exempt from CLIA certification. Currently there are two states with approved programs: Washington and New York. New York has a partial exemption; therefore, if the laboratory is located in New York, conta ct the New York State Agency to determine if the exemption applies.

W450 (Rev. 135, Issued: 02- 27-15, Effective: 04 -27-15, Implementation: 04 -27-15) (v) During fire drills, clients may be evacuated to a safe area in facilities certified under the Health Care Occupancies Chapter of the Life Safety Code. Guidance \u00a7483.470(i)(2)(v) The Life Safety Code NFPA 101, 2000 Edition at 3.3.167 defines safe location as \"a location remote or separated from the effects of a fire so that such effects no longer pose a threat.\" W451 (Rev. 04 -27-15) (3) Facilities must meet the requirements of paragraph (i)(1) and (2) of this section for any live-in and relief staff they utilize. Guidance \u00a7483.470(i)(3) In the case of live -in staff, drills must occur quarterly. Typically, live -in staff can be found in facilities that fall under Chapter 32/33 of the LSC code. Drills should be held at varying times of the day and night for clients to practice evacuation including morning, afternoon, evening and the middle of the night. (j) Standard: Fire protection. Guidance \u00a7483.470(j) These standards are covered by the Life Safety Code (LSC) survey. The facility must meet the appropriate chapter of the Life Safety Code, 2000 edition. When surveying an ICF/IID for compliance with the LSC, it is first necessary to determine whether the facility will be surveyed under Health Care (HC) or Board and Care (BC) occupancy. If clients receive nursing services, or if the provider elects to use Health Care, the facility should be surveyed as a Health Care Facility under Chapter 18 or 19 of the LSC, as appropriate. If clients receive personal care and pro tective oversight but not continuing nursing services, the facility is to be surveyed under Board and Care and the following three steps should be followed: 1) Determine the size (16 or less = small; 17 or more = large); 2) Determine the Evacuation Difficulty (PROMPT, SLOW, or IMPRACTICAL) using Appendix F of the fire safety evaluation system for board and care facilities (FSES/BC); and 3) Survey the building using one of two methods: a. The prescriptive requirements of Chapters 32 or 33; or b. The FSES/BC, Appendix G . (1) General. Except as otherwise provided in this section\u2014 (i) The facility must meet the applicable provisions of either the Health Care Occupancies Chapters or the Residential Board and Care Occupancies Chapter of the 2000 edition of the Life Safety Code of the National Fire Protection Association.

Guidance \u00a7483.470(l)(1) The facility is clean and staff have eliminated opportunities for cross -contamination of infections. Food is stored, prepared, distributed, and served in a sanitary manner to prevent food borne illness. W455 04 -27-15) There must be an active program for the prevention, control, and investigation of infection and communicable diseases. Guidance \u00a7483.470(l)(1) Facilities maintain an ongoing surveillance program of communicable disease control and investig ation of infections and an active training program that ensures the clients served receive adequate prevention of transmission information and skills, according to needs. The facility's infection control program should include procedures for: identificat ion of the extent of infestation or infection; protection of clients; treatment of clients; notification of family or legal guardian; reporting to the health department as indicated; and continued follow -up to resolution. Both the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the CDC have specific requirements regarding human immuno -deficiency virus (HIV), TB, and hepatitis precautions. These requirements should be incorporated into the facility's practices when relevant to the clients residing in the facility. Concerns about OSHA violations should be referred to OSHA. W456 (Rev. 135, Issued: 02- 27-15, Effective: 04 -27-15, Implementation: 04 -27-15) (2) The facility must implement successful corrective action in affected problem areas. W457 (Rev. 135, Issued: 02 -27-15, Effective: 04 -27-15, Implementation: 04 -27-15) (3) The facility must maintain a record of incidents and corrective actions related to infections. W458 (Rev. 135, Issued: 02- 27-15, Effective: 04 -27-15, Implementation: 04 -27-15) (4) The facility must prohibit employees with symptoms or signs of a communicable disease from direct contact with clients and their food. Guidance \u00a7483.470(l)(4) The facility should have and implement a policy that clearly delineates those signs and symptoms for which they will restrict staff access to clients or to clients' food. W459 (Rev. services -27-15) \u00a7483.480(a)(1) Each client must receive a nourishing, well balanced, diet including modified and specially prescribed diets. Guidance \u00a7483.480(a)(1) \"Well balanc ed diets\" are defined as diets that contain a variety of foods from the food groups currently recommended by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND). \"Modified and specially -prescribed\" diets are defined as diets that are altered in any way to enable the client to eat (e.g. food that is chopped, pureed) or diets that are intended to correct or prevent a nutritional deficiency or health problem. Refer to W463 and W474 regarding modified and specially prescribed diets. The following may be indicators of or may lead to compromised nutritional status: Unplanned significant weight gain or loss; Fever/infection; Diarrhea; Chronic disease; Chewing and Swallowing problems; Teeth and gum diseases; Excessive use of laxatives; Abnormal laboratory values; Brittle, dry hair; Ridged or spoon shaped nails; Dry flaky skin; and Unexplained changed in mood such as general fatigue, apathy, irritability, lack of concentration. If one or more of these indicators are present, determine the facility's response throu gh observation, interview, and record review. Surveyors should assure the facility is responsive to client food allergies and the potential for adverse food/drug interactions. If surveyors suspects these may exist, investigate further. Examples of facility responsiveness to allergies and food/drug interactions include, but are not limited to: Clients on long term anticonvulsant drug regimens (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone) are periodically monitored per facility policy for decreased serum levels of folic acid and vitamin D; Therapeutic doses of nutrients are provided to decrease the likelihood of anemia and prevent decreased bone density, etc.; and Fiber and fluids are increased in the diet of clients to decrease the likelihood of constipation. Guidance \u00a7483.470(a)(1) Clients of grossly different ages, functional levels, and/or social needs should not be housed together unless all of the following documentation support the placement: Assessment; Client program plan; Staff documen tation of client response to training dietitian must be employed either full- time, part -time, or on a consultant basis a t the facility's discretion. Guidance \u00a7483.480(a)(2) The facility employs a registered dietitian either on a part -time, full- time or on a consultant basis. W462 (Rev. qualified dietitian is not employed full -time, the facility must designate a person to serve as the director of food services. Guidance \u00a7483.480(a)(3) Where the facility does not have a full- time qualified dietitian, verify that the director of fo od services coordinates with a dietitian to assure the nutritional adequacy of meals and snacks. The food service director coordinates with the part -time or consultant dietitian to develop client meal plans and monitor client nutritional status. The qual ifications of the food service director may be dictated by facility policy or by state law, if applicable. In small group home settings where the staff and clients plan and prepare meals cooperatively, there may not be a designated food services director. In these cases, the consultant or part - time dietitian would meet with the available home staff to ensure adequacy of menus and diets. \u00a7483.480(a)(4) The client's interdisciplinary team, including a qualified dietitian must (Rev. -27-15) \u00a7483.480(a)(4) including those used as a part of a program to manage inappropriate client behavior. Guidance \u00a7483.480(a)(4) Modifying a clients' diet must never be used as (Rev. -27-15) \u00a7483.480(a)(5) Foods proposed for use as a primary reinforcement of adaptive behavior are evaluated in light of the client's nutritional status and needs. Guidance \u00a7483.480(a)(5) This regulation addresses the use of food in shaping positive adaptive behavior. Where clients have specialized nutritional needs, these needs must be taken into consideration. When food is used as a primary reinforcement of behavior for a client who has a dietary restriction, these foods should be consistent with the foods allowed by the prescribed diet. Food us ed as a reinforcement must be part of a behavior plan approved by the IDT and consistent with nutritional parameters for that client. For example, a client with diabetes does not receive concentrated sweets as a reinforcement. W466 (Rev. \u00a7483.480(a)(6) Unless otherwise specified by medical needs, the diet must be prepared at least in accordance with the latest edition of the recommended dietary allowances of the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council, National Academy of Sciences, adjusted for age, sex, disability and activity. Guidance \u00a7483.480(a)(6) The suggested guidelines can be accessed at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).

Food that is ground, chopped or pureed is based on assessed client need, and only to the extent required. Food consistency modifications due t o an acute medical or dental condition are temporary and; client's food consistency is upgraded at the soonest possible time. Clients with chronic medical or dental conditions are periodically reviewed and at least annually for the possibility of an upgra de in food consistency. Client assessments must document the justification for modified texture of the client's diet. W475 (Rev. utensils\" refers to eating utensils and adaptive eating equipment that enable clients to eat as independently as possible in accordance with their highest functional level. Commonly used utensils (fork, knife, and spoon) appropriate to the food being consumed are provided to all clients except those using adaptive equipment instead.
