The scientific name we are referring to here isJuglans nigra L. Black walnuts are smaller, harder, and have a stronger scent than the English walnuts you normally find in stores. These hulls contains high concentrations of chemicals called tannins that can dry up mucus. That is why it is one of the most common herbs used for those practicing a Sebi diet. What Does Black Walnut Hull Powder Do? In addition to its mucus drying properties, there is some evidence to suggest that black walnut hull drives parasites out of the body and clears up harmful bacteria and fungus. Walnut husk extracts have demonstrated antimicrobial effects against grampositive bacteria. (Oliveira et al.2008; FernandezAgullo et ) extracts also inhibit xanthine oxidase, an enzyme which forms xanthine which causes hyperuricemia, a metabolic disorder causing inflammation and gout. (Wang et al.2015 ) Juglone, a naphthoquinone found in walnuts, was demonstrated to have cytotoxic effects against cultured melanoma cells. (Aithal et al.2009 ) Naphthoquinones found in walnut hull powder can be used as broadspectrum biocides. (Wright et al.2007 ) Apart from expelling parasites, fungus and bacteria there are suggestions that the herb has a positive effect on diseases like diphtheria, syphilis, and leukemia. More research is needed, but if we rely on traditional medicine the effects are proven. "}
