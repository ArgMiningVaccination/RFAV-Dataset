The spiritual protocol is the way and the behavioral approach of believers towards each other, to maintain love and access to spiritual benefits. Principle of spiritual protocol 1.God is the God of all flesh but not all flesh is of God. God created all religion and every man is spiritual, every man has a spirit component, God is the Lord of all flesh, and all flesh is of God. 2.God is not a religious God but a spiritual God. God isn't religious, God is a spirit and not a man, God is not from any tribe, he understands all languages because he's a spirit, so we serve a spirit by a religion 3.The problem of the Church is doctrine. Did you know anything that divides the body of Christ is not from church? However, it's from the devil. For example, girls that donut over their air hair, do makeup do attachment, and all sorts of people tend to believe that they are all going to hellfire, which is a lie. Hindrances to honor 1.Pride. Pride kills faster than jealousy, some people are too proud 2.Lack of character. Many people don't have character, even the spiritual people are inclusive, learn how to talk to people both young ones and older ones It is also part of hindrances to honor.
