But Nick Cork and Gareth Williams say that students risk being indoctrinated and should be taught only about interventions that have been shown to be safe and effective \"Demonstrate awareness that many patients use complementary and alternative therapies, and awareness of the existence and range of these therapies, why patients use them, and how this might affect other types of treatment that patients are receiving . \"1 This guidance, from the UK General Medical Council's Tomorrow's Doctors encapsulates lucidly and concisely why medical students are taught about alternative medicine. I find it difficult to conceive of a counterargument. ### The choices patients make To provide quality care doctors must be aware of choices patients make and be able to discuss them in an informed and non-judgmental way. Any other approach puts the doctor-patient relationship at risk. Patients are reluctant to raise issues that they believe meet with disapproval. These principles apply to complementary and alternative medicine the same way as to other lifestyle choices. And this is a choice made by many people in the United Kingdom. The annual spend on alternative health treatments has been estimated to be as much as \u00a35.4bn (\u20ac6.5bn; $8.9bn).2 All aspects of medical care are involved and not only in general practice. As a nephrologist I learnt that patients wanted complementary therapies to relieve some of the intractable and distressing symptoms, such as skin itch and restless legs, associated with chronic renal failure. Patients discussed among themselves the therapies they found useful. For my part I checked that there were no known interactions with their current conventional treatment and was pleased if symptoms were relieved.

In a recent paper, Robert Jutte wrote that Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), the acknowledged founder of homoeopathy, was the first physician who administrated a sham medicine as placebo to many of the patients coming to his practice on a systematic and regular basis, at least as far as we know from historical documents in the Archives of the Institute for the History of Medicine of the Robert Bosch Foundation in Stuttgart1. Jutte gives some explanation about why Hahnemann prescribed placebos to his patients and henceforth placebo quite immediately was associated with a \"medical deception\"1. ...in the meantime, until the second medicament is given, one can soothe the patient's mind and desire for medicine with something inconspicuous such as a few teaspoons a day of raspberry juice or sugar of milk...2.(cit. ref 5 page 210) and moreover: Patients who have firm confidence in the honesty and skill of their physician, will have no hesitation to be satisfied with a dose of sugar of milk, which may be exhibited every two, four, or seven days, agreeably to the wishes of the patient; such a course will never lessen their confidence...3 (cit. ref 5, page 210). It does not matter if prescription is potentially noxious or ineffective, the main thing is that the patient goes on with trusting the physician and his prescription. While most general practitioners at the end of the XVIII century came across with the concept of placebo, as in Cullen's Clinical Lectures, placebo medicine was replaced by Hahnemann by sham medicine, mostly represented by milk sugar. In this perspective, it is arguable that this sham medicine, used as placebo, was a fundamental issue in medical practice and probably the utmost target of medical therapy in times where medicine lacked most current weapons against epidemics, toxicology, acute illness and particularly infectious diseases. Furthermore, medicines as potentially noxious substances, whose activity was often presumptive as it came quite exclusively from trusting the valuable expertise of colleagues rather than the experimental evidence, were diluted to ensure patients a harmless action and fundamentally a placebo effect. Students who are addressing EBM and alternative medicine have to face many controversial opinions still existing about whether homeopathy has built up an exclusively placebo-based tenet4-7. The fact is that the similia principle has never been demonstrated on a scientific ground, though many theoretical attempts sprout from authors elsewhere8,9. On the other hand, lack of evidence exists even for placebo in homeopathy, as no single report, as far as we know, has demonstrated the neuro-psycho-endocrine source of a homeopathy-driven healing in any clinical trial. Furthermore, if Hahnemann used placebo very frequently in many of his patients, one has to ask why homeopaths grieve for building up awkward, puzzling and poorly evidenced theories on liquid water to explain the presumptive efficacy of their remedies, when Hahnemann frequently used milk sugar. Therefore, I am afraid we are talking about a fake. Homeopathy came to the light as a pragmatic and empirical medicine, based on the increasing people approval on practitioners' bona fide and on its consequent enhanced diffusion. Yet, surprisingly, most current homeopaths are justifying homeopathy as an ethically correct medicine because of the many people still resorting to it. References 1. J\u00fctte R.

Of 1363 votes cast in the online poll, 'Should medical students be taught alternative medicine?'2, 47% voted yes and a marginally victorious 53% voted no. The correspondence raised several points to which we would like to respond. What is alternative medicine? Alternative medicine encompasses such a diverse range of practices that it becomes near impossible to define precisely. Pragmatically, it could be regarded as anything that falls outside the Cochrane Collaboration's definition of evidence-based medicine: 'the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients'3. Herbal, or 'natural', remedies are therefore considered alternative. Some may contain pharmacologically active ingredients, but will only make the transition to mainstream medicine when these have been isolated, characterised, made available in standardised formulations and their effects and side-effects fully understood from properly designed clinical trials. Crucially, they will have to have demonstrated efficacy and an acceptable risk:benefit profile under those conditions. Similarly, diet, exercise and other lifestyle interventions which demonstrate benefits that are supported by a robust evidence base should be part of mainstream medical practice. Practices that do not satisfy these criteria, or which claim an implausible mechanism of action at odds with basic science, can be considered 'alternative'. We have no quarrel with measures that might work, only with those who fail to put them to the test, or who refuse to accept evidence that they have no effect beyond an unethical placebo. Should UK medical students be taught alternative medicine? We agree that, as long as patients in the UK continue to explore alternative therapies, their doctors must be equipped to discuss the benefits - or lack thereof - and risks of these. This does not mean that medical students should be taught how to practise alternative medicine. Crucially, the pseudoscience and fudged statistics of alternative medicine must not figure in a 21st-century medical curriculum. It is wholly inappropriate to teach the intricacies of palm healing, homeopathic succussion or the balance of qi flow, in an age where drugs with proven efficacy are rejected because they are not quite good enough. Undergraduate education needs to be unbiased, highlighting the strength, or absence, of supporting evidence. It is enriching for students to develop an awareness of other cultures and traditional practices, but this must be through the prism of safety and effectiveness. We may reflect on the historic traditions of the four humours, or bloodletting, but it would be harmful to advocate these at the expense of modern medicine that can actually help. There is evidence that alternative therapies are currently being uncritically taught to students in their early years through self-selected modules4. We maintain that to cover such material before students have had the opportunity to acquire a firm grounding in pharmacology and evidence-based medicine carries a risk of indoctrination. Our intention is not to censor or stifle debate. Senior students, if competent in critical appraisal, are suitably placed to make informed decisions regarding the safety and effectiveness of alternative therapies and should be offered this opportunity. There is a clear parallel with the universally-accepted principle of informed consent. We accept that patients cannot make informed decisions regarding their treatment options until equipped and supported to interpret such new information. Medical students, in their transition between lay and specialist insight, are no different. Should teaching about alternative medicine be regulated? Undergraduate education must prepare doctors to have sensible discussions with their patients, through a curriculum that prioritises, as one commenter advocated, evidence-based medicine, critical appraisal and the management of risk and uncertainty. The current teaching of alternative medicine in some UK medical schools therefore raises fundamental concerns about quality assurance. The General Medical Council's direction, in Tomorrow's Doctors, that medical graduates should 'demonstrate awareness...of the existence and range of [complementary and alternative therapies]', provides flexibility to be applied variably across the country, according to course coordinators' personal interpretations. Feeding false information about alternative medicine to medical students, especially those unprepared for critical analysis of evidence, undermines the standard of education provided to undergraduates as a whole and weakens the teaching of evidence-based medicine elsewhere. We have identified an opportunity here to improve the curricula of medical schools for the benefit of our patients. We repeat our call to the GMC1 to review the quality of teaching related to alternative medicine in the UK, and await their response with interest. References 1. Catto G, Cork N, Williams G.

Competing interests: No competing interests This was a BAD question - it has been open to interpretation too variously. Some respondents answer the question 'yes' but as to whether medical students should be taught 'about alternative medicine'. I say 'yes' to that - but that is not what the question asked. The question asked whether students 'should be taught alternative medicine'. Surely this implies students should be taught how to practice CAM? And the answer to that must be 'no'. A confused question, and even more confused respondents. May the wu be with you all! Competing interests: No competing interests Should we bring more CAM components and related issues in medical education. Globalization and the revolution in information technology have made its impact in the usage of CAM. The main noticeable points here are 1) Marketing technics by pharmaceutical industry facilitated the higher usage of CAM, especially in the expanse of herbal drugs. (1) 2) The aging population in developing and developed countries, backed by better purchasing option for the middle class. 3) Pre- occupied credence that they are open from adverse event. 4) The rudiments of CAM plays a dynamic role in medical tourism. A transcultural clientele in countries like India and medical tourist have the strength the concept of the CAM cash rich. As a father of Modern Medicine, Hippocrates says unique care of suffering that \"Cure rarely Comfort mostly Console always\" is clearly suggestive of integrative approach to treating a manifestation. Increased use of complementary and alternative medicine has made influences in the medical education to teach Medical professionals regarding the basic concepts of CAM (2) . It might help to make alternative choices for their own patients by giving them a proper direction (3) like in the area of treatment like life style disorders, Palliative care etc..It also have advantage to study the Herb-drug or food-drug reactions are most common in case of usage of dietary supplements or herbal medications along with prescribed one (4). Networking with international hospital and universities has given a competitive advantage to know about More Practical Applicability of CAM. The study showed the strength of these bodies was in their competitive spirits. Regulatory agencies take a knot in it and permitted clinical and moral changes in educational issues in the health care sector. While some of the most common issues in the teaching of traditional medicines are- 1) All most literature pertaining to the traditional herbs are in their regional language often not accessible to the other language groups. 2) In CAM, The History, examination and investigation, diagnosis and treatment is based individual constituent.

This debate was brought to our attention a couple of weeks ago when we attended a two day course on alternative therapies, a compulsory part of the final year at Warwick. We disagreed with some of the aspects of the argument put forward by our peer at Cambridge and so wanted to express our viewpoint on the discussion. The debate as to the use of alternative medicine is an important one, and it cuts to a key conflict present in modern-day medical practice: the clash of evidence- and values-based medicine. Basing treatment options on evidence-based medicine is integral to modern medical practice and is a central theme in the GMC document Good Medical Practice, which states doctors must \"provide effective treatments based on the best available evidence\" 1. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is often key in developing guidelines for treatment based on evidence of efficacy. Some alternative therapies have been included in NICE guidelines for the treatment of certain conditions, for example depression and lower back pain. Other areas of the medical curriculum are founded on treatments recommended by NICE, and so we feel that such alternative therapies should be no different. Values-based medicine is founded on the principle that all patients have different views and priorities regarding their health and the treatment they are willing to receive. Addressing the values of a patient before making a joint decision on treatment enhances the doctor-patient relationship. The popularity of alternative medicines increases the relevance of developing an awareness of alternative therapies during medical school. In the GMC document Tomorrow's Doctors, there is an expectation that future doctors should \"demonstrate awareness that many patients use complementary and alternative therapies, and awareness of the existence and range of these therapies, why patients use them, and how this might affect other types of treatment that patients are receiving\" 2. A good doctor should acknowledge the alternative therapies available and use evidence to help their patient to make an informed decision. We agree that the stage of medical school at which alternative medicine is discussed is relevant to the debate. If we expect our medical students to have a balanced and informed view then we should give them the skills to analyse evidence and opinion prior to tackling such issues. A good medical student should have a healthy cynicism for what is taught, irrespective of the topic. However, medical schools also have a responsibility to ensure that the material is taught in a balanced manner. We suggest that teaching this material at a later stage of the course is likely to increase the ability of students to question those teaching. In the article published it is claimed that the guidance given in two GMC documents is in contradiction 3, although we believe the pieces are consistent. The GMC simply guides that doctors should be equipped with the knowledge and skills to advise patients on the effectiveness and likely benefit of treatments. We feel that this differs from the notion of promoting such treatments, when there is no evidence base; thus allowing clinicians to fulfill the principle of providing \"effective treatments based on the best available evidence\". We suggest that the role of the clinician should be to assess the evidence base competently, thus avoiding any potentially dangerous adverse effects, and to relay this to the patient in a non-judgmental manner, allowing them to make an informed decision. Finally, the clinician should support a patient if a treatment helps alleviate their symptoms. In this way, we as future doctors will follow the key principle to medical practice, also recommended by the GMC, to \"make the care of your patient your first concern\" 1. References 1.

BMJ 2014;348:g2417 Competing interests: No competing interests I find that Sir Graeme Cato's response indicates in a very tangential manner that we should be aware of alternative medicine at medical school, as there are many treatments and therapies that are equally lacking in evidence. It also implies that we should be able to respond to patients' beliefs and expectations. I would agree with the above, but if such a tack is taken, it should not be at the expense of far more valuable and necessary commodities for medical students, such as professionalism sessions, physiology/pharmacology or anatomy. Patients' expectations and beliefs are changing, as are fashions, with time. The essential core of our calling is to be able to respond, but also to be able to perform our duties and apply the knowledge that is evidence based. Any more diluting of our students' knowledge and skills with transient topics only promises to weaken the value and effectiveness of the doctor in the future. Competing interests: No competing interests There was an interesting debate (Head to Head) regarding whether medical students should be taught alternative medicine (1) As a GP involved in medical education (but also practising CBT and medical hypnosis) I would never question the importance of following scientific evidence, and especially keeping up to date and having the flexibility to change practice in the light of new evidence. But it is vital to remember that the key to success with getting a patient better so often lies in the therapeutic doctor - patient relationship. I have seen this time and time again but this is hard to measure in a randomized, controlled trial and remains anecdotal. Tapping into the patient's belief systems and at times gently challenging these belief systems whether regarding illness or their life in general, as well as showing a genuine interest, makes a real difference. One of the major difficulties for GPs is being able to do this within the time-frame of a normal NHS consultation. A longer consultation where taking a history, and doing the relevant physical examination but also examining patients ideas, beliefs and expectations can save a lot of extra appointments and ineffective consultations in the long run. Unfortunately within the NHS the system is not currently set up for this and even continuity of care with the same doctor spread over shorter appointments can be lacking. Is it surprising our patients will often gravitate to complementary medicine as a means of trying to deal with their dis-ease? Clearly whether complementary medicine is helpful depends on the chosen therapy, the expertise and experience of the provider of care, and the therapeutic relationship (the rapport and belief that the patient has in the therapist that they will get them better). I remain concerned that some patients do resort to questionable therapies and therapists when more time spent with their GP, with our rigorous training and perhaps more critical minds would prove more effective and safe. Educating medical students about alternative medicine may be more about, as doctors, looking at our own alternative models of providing care to our patients.

Graeme Catto, Nick Cork, Gareth Williams Should medical students be taught alternative medicine? Competing interests: No competing interests I do not understand the term 'alternative' medicine. Since Ancient Times Plants, Herbs were used. These Ancient traditions are the original remedies. Gradually, man started using these plant extracts adding chemicals which is the Pharmaceutical Trade. This has side effects. I therefore presume Alternative refers to Pharmaceuticals and not the Ancient Traditional plant cures which do not have any side effect. It is this Original treatment which needs to be revived. Peace be with you. Competing interests: No competing interests I have enjoyed very much reading the paper published this week in the Head to Head section of our extraordinary and absorbing Bmj. Article was written by Catto, Cork and Williams, it says about one of many unexpected things that are happening now in the health sector\u2014one of the big problems facing the medical care and profession today; it invites all its readers to reflect on the new challenges recognized in the contemporary world, by all researchers in medical and educational sciences. I was very interested in it because in recent times, after finishing their studies, many of our graduates become very interested in using unofficial therapies as a complement for their daily work. Even some of them follow higher studies in Asiatic medicine, phytotherapy, and other subjects considered before to be crazy dangerous therapeutical procedures. Instead of using the words traditional or complementary or folkloric medicine, I use the terms official or unofficial medicine for designating medical procedures recognized or not, as authorized, by our nowadays Colombian governmental laws that rule our social, moral and ethical behavior. The successes of drugs and other medical orthodox treatments introduced in practice in the 1950s have been followed by several reverses and therapeutic disasters; thalidomide, and several dangerous nitrogenous synthetic compounds are wonderful examples of those bad calamitous events. Many scientific works published in journals and magazines show the irrelevancy of several official drugs and orthodox therapies well known by doctors. In provinces, towns, villages, cities several doctors prescribe drugs and official treatments without success. The situation is so critical that many people think that some responsible leaders, for medical care in Colombia, are playing more at business than at improving people's health; for that reason patients don't believe in the effectiveness of several official procedures and they want to be treated with something quite different. Another very valid reason by which people refuse to take official treatments is the very high and globalized cost that is medical care in Colombia. People don't earn a lot of money for their work done or services rendered. They don\u00b4t have enough money to meet the needs of any situation related to disease. Whatever the great advances of science and technology, there are a lot of things on earth that science has dreamed on and Phytotherapy is one of them. The most important and relevant events in the story of medicine and therapy are connected with the discovery of what are called metabolites of secondary origin in biochemistry. To that list belong very useful therapeutic substances, such as antibiotics, alkaloids, phenolic compounds ... Geographic position, radiation intensity, climate and soil conditions of tropical countries are very favorable for natural production of these substances. Along human history innumerable plants have been listed for their excellent traditional therapeutic uses, and a lot of researchers have been very interested in studying their curative properties. I think the discovery of America is not only important for the finding of a new world, but because Spanish conquerors met here a vast variety of nutritional and medical plants and animals. They met a vast flora with no equal anywhere in the 16th century world: there was nothing that could match it in those times. They were so interested in our plants that they designed and did a big specific plan for obtaining, collecting, culturing and studying plants with therapeutical properties, produced in our territory. Botanical expedition projects were led by the most important botany researchers of the world in Colombia, venerable scientific men making long but productive journeys of investigation. From the results of many of those scientific works were born the roots of current pharmacotherapy. Not only poor people use medical plants, but also actors, sportsmen, celebrities, members of the highest social classes, in all countries around the world. People use them because of their excellent therapeutic properties. People have recognized and approved them because century after century, throughout many generations, those plants have produced the same wonderful results. So for this reason, although complementary medicine is not an integral part of the curriculum in several medical schools, and although we don\u00b4t have the powerful academic labs, and the money for implementing the necessary techniques for making research, school teachers should include in their academic plans, how to prescribe and study those plants socially accredited at practice by people, as good tools for helping to the medical care system to solve many therapeutic problems. Competing interests: I was born in Colombia and as Biochemist I have isolated and studied at lab, several active compounds present in plants used in unofficial medicine. "}
