The roles and responsibilities of the individuals and guardians are included as well . Providers can give helpful hints to individuals or guardians to help them in select ing a waiver provider. Section 1.1 : The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS ) The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) , under the U.S. Depart ment of Health and Human Services (HHS) , is the federal agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs that provide healthcare to the aged and indigent populations. In Indiana, the Medicaid program provides services to indigent families, children, pregnant women, senior citizens, persons with disabilities and persons who are blind. To provide home - and community -based Medicaid services as an alternative to institutional care, 1915(c) of the Social Security Act allows states to submit a request to the CMS to \"waive\" certain provisions in the Social Security Act that apply to state Medicaid programs: A waiver of comparability of services allows states to offer individuals in target groups services that are different from those the general Medicaid population receives. A waiver of statewideness gives states the option of limiting availability of servic es to specified geographic areas of the state. A waiver of income and resource requirements for the medically needy permits states to apply different eligibility rules for medically needy persons in the community . The CMS must review and approve all waiver proposals and amendments submitted by each state. The CMS reviews all waiver requests, applications, renewals, amendments and financial reports. Additionally, the CMS performs management reviews of all Home - and Community -Based Services (HCBS) waivers to ascertain their effectiveness, safety and cost -effectiveness. The CMS requires states to assure that federal requirements for waiver service programs are met and verifies that the states' assurances in their waiver programs are upheld in the day -to-day operation. Additional information about the CMS is available on the CMS website at cms.gov . Section 1.2: FSSA Division of Disability and Rehabilitative Services (DDRS) As a division of the Indiana Family and Soci al Services Administration (FSSA), the DDRS has two overarching responsibilities for children and adults with physical and cognitive disabilities : Facilitate partnerships that enhance the quality of life Provide continuous, life -long support The Bureau of Developmental Disabilities Services (BDDS) is under the DDRS. For more information , see the DDRS homepage at in.gov/fssa. Section 1: Roles and Responsibilities DDRS HCBS Waivers 2 Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 Section 1.3: The Bureau of Developmental Disabilities Services (BDDS) Within the DDRS, the BDDS administers individualized, integrated community -based services for individuals with intellectual/ developmental disabilities and their families , including two HCBS waiver programs for persons who meet the level of care (LOC) requi rements for admission to an intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilit ies (ICF/IID) : Family Supports Waiver ( FSW Habilitation ( CIH) Waiver The FSW and CIH Waiver programs provide services to individuals in a range of community settings , as an alternative to care in an ICF/IID . To ensure provision of services and supports statewide, the BDDS has established eight BDDS district offices serv ing specific regions in Indiana . The BDDS service coordinators determine initial eligibility for intellectual/developmental disabilit y services, determining LOC for ICF/IID services. BDDS service coordinators also determine a new \"initial\" LOC for individuals who have been terminated from the HCBS waiver program , but desire to return to waiver services within the same waiver year . The BDDS has statutory authority over the state's programs for individuals with intellectual/developmental disabilities. The BDDS is also the placement authority for persons wit h intellectual/developmental disabilities and helps develop policies and procedures for Indiana Medicaid waivers that serve persons with intellectual/developmental disabilities. Additional information about the BDDS is available on the Developmental Disabilities Services page at in.gov/ fssa/ddrs. Section 1.4: BDDS Quality Assurance Services Previously , the responsibility of the quality assurance belonged to the Bureau of Quality Improvement Services (BQIS) , which has been integrated into BDDS . BDDS is now responsible for developing and implementing quality improvement and quality assurance systems to assure the health and welfare of indivi duals receiving Medicaid HCBS waiver services, specifically the FSW or CIH Waiver. The oversight activities include the following: Developing policy Conducting case record reviews Investigating complaints Reviewing mortality Managing the state's automated system for reporting incidents of abuse, neglect and exploitation Assuring compliance with Indiana waiver regulations Researching best practices Analyzing quality data Managing provider reverification Monitoring provider accreditation Additional informat ion about the BDDS Quality Assurance Services is available on the BDDS Quality Assurance page at in.gov/ FSSA /DDRS . DDRS HCBS Waivers Section Responsibilities Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 3 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 Section 1.5: FSSA Office of Medicaid Policy and Planning (OMPP) The FSSA is the single state Medicaid agency for Indiana. A division of the FSSA, the Office of Medicaid Policy and Planning (OMPP) , has been appointed by the Secretary to serve as the administrative authority for Medicaid HCBS programs and is responsible for monitoring the DDRS operation of the HCBS programs for compliance with CMS requirements. The OMPP is responsible for oversight of all HCBS program activities, including the following: LOC determinations Plan of care reviews Identification of trends a nd outcomes Initiating action to achieve desired outcomes Retaining final authori ty for approval of LOC and plans of care The OMPP develops Medicaid policy for the state of Indiana and, on an ongoing and as -needed basis, works collaboratively with the DDRS to formulate policies specific to the HCBS program or that hav e a substantial impact on HCBS program individuals . The OMPP seeks and reviews comment from the DDRS before the adoption of rules or standards that may affect the services, programs or providers of medical assistance services for indi viduals with intellectual disabilities who receive Medicaid services. The OMPP and DDRS collaborate to revise and develop the application of the HCBS program to reflect current FSSA goals and policy programs .

Section 1: Roles and Responsibilities DDRS HCBS Waivers 4 Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 Section 1. 7: Waiver Service Providers , Including Selected Contracting Case Management Organizations HCBS waiver provider applicants are agencies, companies and individuals that have applied to provide waiver services and have been found to have the qualifications and business structures in place to seek enrollment as a Medicaid provider. After DDRS approval, the providers must then en roll in Medicaid as Indiana Health Coverage Programs (IHCP) providers. For IHCP enrollment, t he provider type for HCBS waiver providers is Type 32 - Waiver Provider . There are special ties under th is waiver provider type including: 359 - Community Integration and Habilitation Waiver 360 - Family Supports Waiver 363 - Money Follows the Person (MFP) Demonstration Grant For more information on how to enroll in Medicaid, see the Provider Enrollment provider reference module. After enroll ing in Medicaid, the providers are paid by the IHCP to provide direct services to Medicaid HCBS waiver program individuals . The DDRS -approved selected contract ing case m anagement organization s are waiver service providers that provide only case management services to waiver individuals . These services include the following: Implementing the recently enhanced person -centered planning process Helping the individual identify members of the Individualized Support Team (IST) Developing and submitting to the state the service plan known as the plan of care/ service plan Developing a person -centered individualized support plan (PCISP) Case management providers often refer to themselves as case management organizations , using the acronym CMOs. Specific responsibilities of the case management provider, including monitoring activities, are described in Section 10.29: Case Man agement . Individuals participating in HCBS waiver service programs administered by DDRS must have case management services. Individuals are provided a choice from among all CMOs that have been selected as contractors through a request for services, approved by the DDRS and enrolled by IHCP . After individual s choose a CMO, they choose a case manager . The individual 's chosen case manager provides a list of available service providers at any time that the individual reque sts to select or change service providers, which includes changing providers of case management services. Case management is the only mand atory HCBS waiver service for individuals who cho ose to participate in Medicaid HCBS waiver serv ice programs administe red by DDRS. Section 1. 8: Office of Administrative Law Proceedings (OALP) Replacing the former FSSA Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) , the Office of Administrative Law Proceeding (OALP) receives and processes appeals from people receiving services within FSSA programs and many other programs. Administrative hearings are held throughout the state of Indiana, usually at county DFR locations, at which time all parties have the opportunity t o present their cases to an administrative law judge (ALJ) in OALP . The ALJs are no longer employees of the FSSA. See Section 8: Appeal Process for additional information about the hearing and appeal process.

N802 Indianapolis, I N 46204 Phone: 317-234-6689 Section 1. 9: Individuals and Guardian s Note: Individual guidance is included in this section for provider reference. It is the policy of the BDDS that individuals (or their legal representatives when indicated ) participate actively and responsibly in the administration and management of their Medicaid HCBS waiver supports and services. The BDDS supports and encourages individual choice in selecting the individual 's case management service provider, developing a PCISP and selecting all other service providers. Successful service delivery is dependent on the collaboration of the IST and entities with oversight responsibilities. The individual s receiving services are the most prominent member s of the IST, making their participation and cooperation in waiver service planning and administration essential. For additional information, see Individual /Guardian Responsibilities While Receiving Waiver Funded Services , available on the Current DDRS Policies page at in.gov/fssa/ddrs. Information Sharing The individual (or the individual' s legal representative, when indicated) must, on request from the BDDS or any DDRS -contracted vendor, provide information for the purpose of administration and management of waiver services. Selecting or Changing Providers When selecting a case management organization /provider, the individual (or the individual's legal representative, when indicated) must participate in the following : Choosing a CMO (provider agency /organization ) from a provider choice list of DDRS -approved and IHCP -enrolled CMOs - For newly a pproved applicants preparing to enter into waiver services, the case management list is generated by the BDDS . - For individuals already active on the waiver, the case management choice list may be generated by the BDDS or by the current provider of case management services . Interviewing and choosing a case manager Completing the service -planning process The individual (or the individual 's legal representative , when indicated) must complete all actions as requested by the BDDS to secure replacement of any other type of provider within one of the following time frames : Sixty calendar days o f the date the change is requested Sixty calendar days o f when the provider gives notice of terminating services to the individual If a new provider is not in place after 60 calendar days, the current provider shall continue to provide services to an individual. Section 1: Roles and Responsibilities DDRS HCBS Waivers 6 Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 See the Helpful Hints for Individuals and Guardians Selecting Waiver Providers section . Participating in Risk Plan Development and Implementation The individual (or the individual's legal representative, when indicated) and the individual's IST must work together to ident ify risk(s) for the individual. This includes recognizing the possibility of adverse consequences by participating in , or lack the reof, a giv en situation. Dignity of risk is having the right to choose and either succeed or fail. In the words of Michael Smull, \"Managing any risk begins with learning what is \"important to\" the person as well as what is \"important for\" and helping to f ind a good balance between them. Often risk is significantly diminished when our understanding of what the person wants deepens and we find reasonably safe ways for the person to get it. In other instances, understanding how important something is leads to better ways to support the person .\" Development of risk plans for individuals will follow current BDDS procedures and be clearly reflected in the PCISP Potential risks should be identified by category, including: - Health - Personal Safety - Behavior Once categorized, the IST can further identif y: - Nature of the risk - Likelihood of occurrence - Severity of consequences from the risk - If a risk mitigation plan is warranted Key points include: - One plan for each identified risk should be developed - The IST should d etermine who will write the plan - All providers must implement the plan - If a team member disagrees with the components of the plan, it should be discussed with the entire IST Implementation of the risk mitigation plan requires : - All support staff must be tra ined on the plan - Adjustment to the plan is made as needed - At least annually, the team will discuss the continued need for the plan The goal is not to remove all risks that may exist in everyday life but to support the individual in navigating risks to reduce the negative outcomes and potential likelihood of the risk. Risk assessment and planning tools and additional guidance is availa ble on the BDDS Quality Assurance page at in.gov/fssa/ddrs and includes the following: Person -centered risk management webinar recording (6/30/2021) Person -centered risk management PowerPoint (6/30/2021) Risk assessment and planning FAQ Risk issues identification tool (Word document) - Teams may use this tool to identify and plan to mitigate risks for an individual. The t ool can be edited to suit the individual's circumstances.

Risk matrix - A tool for teams to assess potential risks for an individual. Allowing Representatives of the State Into the Individual's Home The individual (or the individual 's legal representative, when indicated) must allow representatives from the BDDS, BDDS Quality Assurance designees , the selected case management organization and any DDRS -contracted vendor into the individual 's home for visits scheduled at least 72 hours prior Additionally, HCBS waiver case managers are required to complete unannounced visits with HCBS waiver participants , and participants and/or their legal r epresentatives are expected to allow and participate in these visits as a condition of participation in the HCBS waiver program . Consequences for Nonparticipation Should individual s (or their legal representative, when indicated) choose not to participate actively and responsibly in the administration and management of their Medicaid HCBS waiver supports and services, the BDDS may terminate the individual 's HCBS waiver participation . If the BDDS decides to terminate the individual's HCBS W aiver participati on pursuant to this policy, the BDDS must provide the individual (or the individual's legal representative, when indicated) with written notice of intent to terminate the individual's waiver services. Should a termination occur, the individual (or the individual's legal representative, when indicated) has a right to appeal the state's decision. See Section 8: Appeal Process for further information regarding appeals. Helpful Hints for Individuals and Guardians Select ing Waiver Providers HCBS waiver participants and their guardians may find the following tips useful when selecting a provider: Selecting good providers is critical. It is helpful to think about the issues that are important to you and your family member b efore you begin the process. A list of certified waiver providers for each county is available through your case manager . If you are new to waiver services, or your current agency has terminated your service, you need to prioritize the providers and try to schedule interviews and visits within a short time frame, so the process does not become extended. Individuals who are new to the waiver program are asked to select a provider within 14 calendar days of receiving the provider choice list. Individuals who have been terminated by the current provider must select and transition to a new provider within 60 calendar days of termination. You will be able to make an informed choice by reading information, such as the BDDS Fact Sheets found on the DDRS Bureau of Developmental Disabilities Services page at in.gov/fssa/ddrs , or by discussing alternatives with the case manager or an advocate. You may want to visit an individual who is currently receiving waiver services or meet with various service providers. Case manager s can assist in setting up visits or meeting with service providers. Sometimes a provider can arrange for yo u to visit people who are receiving services from the provider. Remember, when you visit a house or apartment where waiver services are being provided, you are visiting someone's home. When meeting with providers or case manager s, it is important to take n otes because it is easy to forget details later. Ask for copies of any written materials and write down information, such as names, titles, telephone numbers, email addresses and the date of the meeting. It's important to maintain accurate information. See the Questions to Ask Prospective Service Providers section for questions to consider when selecting waiver providers. The questions you ask depend on what kind Section 1: Roles and Responsibilities DDRS HCBS Waivers 8 Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 of service it is and whether you will be served in your fa mily home or in your own home or apartment, with or without housemates. Many of the questions are applicable to any setting, and others can be skipped or modified as needed. General Topics to Discuss with Service Providers Waiver individuals and their guar dians may want to consider and discuss the following with potential service provider s during the selection process : What areas of service are absolute requirements for you and your family member, such as medications being administered on time, direct super vision, sign -language training and so on ? What makes you and your family member happy? What causes pain? How can the provider maximize opportunities for the former, and minimize or eliminate instances of the latter? What do you and your family member want to happen? To find a job? To attend or become a member of a church? To live within a half -hour drive of family? How many housemates would you or your family member like? Anything else? Are these wishes or requirements? What are the risks for you or your family member? Examples include daily seizures, a lack of street - safety skills, the inability to talk or use sign language, forgetfulness, a tendency to hit others when angry and so on. How will the provider deal with those risks? What is the provider's experience working with children and adults with disabilities, or adults who are elderly? How would the provider en sure the implementation of the PCISP ? What connections has the provider established in the community? How would the provider assist in building a support system in the community? Questions to Ask Prospective Service Providers The following are good questio ns for an individual or guardian to ask a prospective service provider: What is the provider's mission? (Does it match the intent you are seeking?) Is the provider certified, accredited or licensed? What are the standards of service? What kind of safety me asures does the provider have in place to protect the individual and assure effective treatment? How does the provider assure compliance with the person's rights? Did you (and family members and advocates) receive copies of your rights as a consumer of services, as well as have these rights explained? Is the provider interested in what you and your family member want or are hopeful about? Is the provider connected to other programs that you may need, such as day support, local school and educ ation services, or work programs? How is the provider connected? Ask for specific contacts. If you are to live in a home shared with other people, can families drop in whenever they wish? How are birthdays, vacations and special events handled? How would f amily money issues be handled? What is the policy on personal and client finances? How would minor illnesses and injuries be handled? What about major illnesses and injuries? What information is routinely reported to families? Can you get a copy of the pro vider's complaint policies and procedures? Is there someone else whom family members can talk to if there is a disagreement? DDRS HCBS Waivers Section 1: Roles and Responsibilities Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 9 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 How are behavior problems handled? Are staff allowed to contact a behavioral support provider? How are new staff trained on the beh avior support plan? Are they trained before working with waiver individuals ? What is the relationship between residential provider and behavioral provider? How is medication handled? What happens if medication is refused? What is the smoking policy? How ar e planning meetings scheduled and conducted, and who attends? Can a family member call a meeting? How does the provider assure that what is agreed on in the meeting is actually provided? Who would be the provider's contact person, how will that contact occ ur, and how often? Is someone available 24 hours a day in case of emergencies? How many people with disabilities ha ve the agency terminated or discontinued from services? Why? What happened to them? Has the agency received any abuse or neglect allegations?

Washington St., R oom 453 Indianapolis, IN 46207 Section 2.2: Provider Reverification The BDDS Provider Services reviews the performance of Medicaid HCBS waiver service providers and makes a reverification determination at least once every four years. Reverification terms are two or four years. The BDDS Provider Services initiates the reverification process and evaluates the following information submitted by each provider: BDDS waiver provider information Indiana Secretary of State documentation Financial information Annual individ ual satisfaction survey and results The BDDS Provider Services also evaluates the provider's data from monitoring activities such as: Complaint investigations BDDS has conducted about the provider and number of substantiated allegations Numbers of and types of incidents Numbers of mortalities and related findings Staff training Criminal background checks Any other infor mation the DDRS deems necessary to assess a pr ovider's performance Note: A provider may select from approved national accreditation organizations set forth in Indiana Code IC 12 -11-1(i). Although case management organizations are not permitted to provide any other waiver services, residential and day program providers may choose to obtain accreditation (specific to Indiana programs) for other waiver services that they are approved to provide . However, this accreditation is not required. Some accreditation entities accredit the organization, whereas ot hers allow providers to select the services they wish to accredit. The process for reverifying providers is outlined in the following DDRS policies: Provider Reverification for Accredited Waiver Services (Revised Oct. 4, 2021) Provider Reverification for Non -Accredited Waiver Services Further information about the reverification process and related tools is available on the BDDS Quality Assurance page at in.gov/ fssa/ddrs. DDRS HCBS Waivers Section 2: Provider Information Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 15 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 The BDDS Quality Assurance director issues providers notices of 24- or 48 -month terms. This notice also specifies that the reverification term is contingent on the provider submitting a signed Provider Agreement within 30 calendar days. The provider's reverification term begins when the document is received by the BDDS . If a provider fails to return a Provider Agreement within the 30 calendar days, the provider will have been deemed to have failed to meet the requirements for reverification and will receive a letter indicating that it is under a six-month approval and may be referred t o the BDDS Quality Assurance director for civil sanctions or a potential moratorium on new admissions. At the end of the six-month period, the provider must repeat the DDRS provider reverification process and submit all the required information to assure t hat the quality of services meets or exceeds the required standards.

Updated information is disseminated through IHCP provider bulletins posted on in.gov/medicaid/providers and announcements on the DDRS website at in.gov/fssa. Each provider is responsible for obtaining the information and implementi ng new or revised policies and procedures as outlined in these notices. IHCP provider reference materials include numerous valuable documents such as the Home - and Community - Based Services Billing Guidelines provider reference module. Note : The timely filing limit on claims for services rendered through the fee -for-service (FFS) delivery system is 180 days from the date of service (DOS). Reimbursement During Hospitalization The following guidance pertains to the delivery of HCBS in acute care hospital stays: In accordance with the recent amendment to Section 1902(h) of the Social Security Act (42 USC 1396a [h]), states' Medicaid programs are permitted to provide Home - and Community -Based Services (HCBS) to individuals in acute care hospitals. The Bureau of Developmental Disabilities Services (BDDS) has developed the following guidance for the delivery of HCBS ( that is , Family Supp ort Waiver and the Community Integration Habilitation Waiver) in acute care hospitals. This guidance is only applicable for individuals receiving BDDS waiver services who are seeking or receiving treatment in an acute care hospital setting for inpatient m edical care or other related services for surgery, acute medical conditions or injuries. This guidance does not pertain to individuals who require long term care in a facility -based setting including , but not limited , to nursing homes, rehabilitation cente rs and/or treatment facilities. Individuals may receive HCBS from their direct support professional or other support staff , like a behavior management or music therapy provider , while receiving medical care and treatment in an acute care hospital , so long as all the following conditions exist: The waiver service is accurately documented i n the person -centered individualized support plan (PCISP) . The waiver service provided meets the need(s) of the individual that are not met through the provision of hospit al services . The waiver service is being provided to ensure a smooth transition between the acute care setting and home - and community -based setting , and preserve the individual's functional abilities . The waiver service cannot be duplicative of what is be ing provided in the acute care setting. The HCBS provided by the direct support professional or other support staff may not be used as a substitute for services that the hospital is obligated to provide through its conditions, requirements and expectations under any participation, licensing and/or professional partnership agreement(s) , as well as local, state and/or federal laws. Case managers are required to document in the case notes when an individual receives acute medical care. The case manager must ensure the waiver service is identified in the PCISP and all the following must be included in the case note: Which waiver service(s) will be provided during the acute hospital stay DDRS HCBS Waivers Section 2: Provider Information Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 17 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 Description of how the waiver service (s) will assist in returning to the community and preserve the individual's functional abilities Coordination and communication activities among individualized support te am members Anticipated length of acute hospital stay Anticipated frequency and duration of the waiver service (s) Case managers may not interrupt or terminate an individual's waiver due to an acute hospital admission or stay. Case managers must update the individual's plan within waiver rules and service limitations as needed to accommodate for acute hospital stays. Parent(s) and legal guardian (s) of adults who are employed as the individual's direct support professional s may continue to provide the waiver service while the individual is receiving care and treatment in the acute care hospital setting , up to and including the current approved number of hours that exists with the current service plan at the time of hospitalization. Individuals receiving servi ces on the Community Integration and Habilitation (CIH) Waiver who may need additional supports while receiving care in an acute care hospital setting may submit a Short -Term Budget Request (STBR) that documents the need for increased supports, the anticipated length of temporary supports needed, and the availability of staff to provide the support. All Family Supports Waiver (FSW ) and CIH Waiver rules and service limitations still apply ( for exam ple, 40-hour rule, incident reporting guidelines and so on ). Third -Party Liability Exempt The IHCP will not bill private insurance carriers through the third -party liability (TPL) or reclamation processes for claims containing any HCBS benefit modifier co des. This billing practice includes modifiers specific to claims for the following benefit plans: Community Integration and Habilitation (CIH) Waiver Family Supports Waiver (FSW) Electronic Visit Verification System Required for Personal Care Services The 21st Century Cures Act directs state Medicaid programs to require providers of personal care services and home health services to use an electronic visit verification (EVV) system to document services rendered. Federal law requires that provid ers use the EVV system to document the following information: Date of service Location of service Individual providing service Type of service Individual receiving service Time the service begins and end s In accordance with federal requirements, the IHCP r equire d providers to use an EVV system to document personal care services rendered on or after Jan. 1, 2021.

Section 2: Provider Information DDRS HCBS Waivers 18 Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 Section 2. 4: Financial Oversight - Waiver Audits The state of Indiana employs a hybrid program integrity approach to overseeing waiver programs, incorporating oversight and coordination by the Program Integrity staff , as well as engaging the full array of technology and analytic tools available through the Frau d and Abuse Detection System (FADS) contractor arrangements. The FSSA has expanded its program integrity activities using a multifaceted approach to activity that includes provider self -audits, desk audits and on -site audits. Program Integrity is require d to complete an initial assessment of each provider type annually. Then, based on the assessment information and referrals, audits are completed as needed. The FADS team analyzes claims data, allowing them to identify providers and claims that indi cate aberrant billing patterns and other risk factors. The program integrity audit process uses data mining, research, identification of outliers, problematic billing patterns, aberrant providers , and issues that are referred by other divisions and state agencies. The State Benefit Integrity Team comp osed of key stakeholders meets biweekly to review and approve audit plans and provider communications, and make policy and system recommendations to affected program areas. The Program Integrity staff also meet s with all waiver divisions on a quarterly basis, at a minimum, and receives referrals on an ongoing basis to maintain open lines of communication and understanding in specific areas of concern, such as policy clarification. The Program Integrity waiver specialist is a subject -matter expert (SME) responsible for directly coordinating with the waiver divisions. This specialist also analyzes data to identify potential areas of risk and identify providers that appear to be outliers warranting review. The SME m ay also perform desk or on - site audits and be directly involved in reviewing waiver providers and programs. Throughout the entire program integrity process, the FSSA maintains oversight. Although the FADS contractor may be incorporated in the audit process , no audit is performed without the authorization of the FSSA. The FSSA's oversight of the contractor's aggregate data is used to identify common problems to be audited, determine benchmarks and offer data to peer providers for educational purposes, when a ppropriate. Program Integrity offers education regarding key program initiatives and audit issues at waiver provider meetings to promote ongoing compliance with federal and state guidelines, including all IHCP and waiver requirements. FSSA Audit Oversight To ensure program integrity, Indiana FSSA Audit Services, the IHCP Finance team and contractors employ various methods, standards, processes and procedures to perform the required audit tasks to bring the Indiana Medicaid P rogram Integrity Program into ful l compliance with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) regulations . Medicaid Fraud Control Audit Overview The Indiana Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU) is an investigative branch of the Attorney General's Office. The MFCU conducts investigations in the following areas: Medicaid provider fraud Misuse of Medicaid members' funds Patient abuse or neglect in Medicaid facilities When the MFCU identifies a provider that has violated regulations in one of these areas, the provider's case is presented to the state or federal prosecutors for appropriate action. Providers can a ccess information about the MFCU at in.gov/attorneygeneral . Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 19 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 Section 3: Additional Medicaid Information This section gives providers additional information about Indiana Health Coverage Program s (IHCP) programs, member eligibility and benefit coverage. Also presented in this section are the prior authorization (PA) and funding streams for Home - and Community -Based Services (HCBS) waiver services.

See the Member Eligibility and Benefit Coverage provider reference module for detailed information about member eligibility and services. Section 3.2: Medicaid Prior Authorization and Funding Streams The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid S ervices (CMS) requires that a n HCBS waiver member exhaust all services regardless of funding stream , including those on the Indiana Medicaid State Plan , before utilizing HCBS waiver services. HCBS waiver programs are considered funding of last resort and have a closed funding stream. The following list shows the hierarchy of funding streams for HCBS waiver programs: 1. Private insurance , Medicare , Department of Education/school funding 2. Medicaid State Plan services 3. Natural/unpaid supports 4. HCBS waiver programs a. Because HCBS waiver programs are a funding stream of last resort, waiver teams must ensure that all other revenue streams are exhausted before utilizing HCBS waiver services. b. Medicaid home health PA requests must specify whether there are other caregiving services received by the member, including but not limited to services provided by Medicare, Medicaid waiver programs, Community and Home Option to Insti tutional Care for the Elderly (CHOICE), vocational rehabilitation, and private insurance programs.

This section also provides information about the two waiver programs that the Division of Disability and Rehabilitati ve Services (DDRS) oversees: Family Supports Waiver (FSW) Community Integration and Habilitation (CIH) Waiver Both waiver s can be found on the DDRS Bureau of Developmental Disabilities Services page at in.gov/fssa/ddrs . Section 4.1: Medicaid Waiver Overview The Medicaid HCBS waiver program began in 1981 in response to t he national trend toward providing home - and community -based services. In the past, Medicai d paid only for institutionally based long -term care services, such as nursing facilities and group homes. The Medicaid HCBS waiver program is authorized in Section 1915(c) of the Social Sec urity Act . The program permits a stat e to furnish an array of home - and community -based services that help Medicaid beneficiaries live in the community and avoid institutionalization. The states have broad discretion to design their waiver programs to address the needs of the waivers' target p opulations. HCBS w aiver serv ices complement and supplement the services available to individuals through the Medicaid State Plan and other federal, state and local public programs, as well as the support that families and communities provide. The Centers fo r Medicare & Medicaid Servi ces (CMS) recognizes that the design and operational features of a waiver program vary depending on the specific needs of the target population, the resources available to the state, service delivery system structure, state goals and objectives, and other factors. A state has the latitude to design a waiver program that is cost -effective and employs a variety of service delivery approaches, including participant direction of services. Indiana applies to CMS for permission to offer Medicaid waivers . The Medi caid waivers use federal Medicaid funds (plus state matching funds) for HCBS as an alternative to institutional care, under the condition that the overall cost of supporting people in the home or community is no more than t he institutional cost for support ing that same group of people. The goals of waiver services are to provide the individual with meaningful and necessary services and supports, to respect the individual's personal beliefs and customs, and to ensure that services a re cost - effective. Specifi cally, waivers for individuals with an intellectual/developmental disability assist an individual to: Become integrated into the community where they live and work Develop social relationships within the person's home and work communities Develop skills to make decisions about how and where the individual wants to live Be as independent as possible DDRS HCBS Waivers Section 4: Intellectual/Developmental Disabilities Services Waivers 22 Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 Section 4.2: State Definition of Intellectual/Developmental Disability Individuals meeting the state criteria for an intellectual/developmental disabil ity and meeting the criteria of an intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilit ies (ICF/IID ) level of care (LOC) determination are eligible to receive waiver services when approve d by the state. Per Indiana Code IC 12-7-2-61, \"developmental disability\" means a severe, chronic disability of an individual that meets all the following conditions: Is attributable to: - Intellectual/developmental disability, cerebral palsy, epilepsy or autism, or - Any other condition (other than a sole diagnosis of mental illness) found to be closely related to intellectual/developmental disability, because this condition results in similar impairment of general intellectual/developmental func tioning or adaptive behavior, or requires treatment or services similar to those required for a person with an intellectual/developmental disability Is manifested before the individual is 22 years of age Is likely to continue indefinitely Results in substa ntial functional limitations in at least three of the following areas of major life activities: - Self-care - Understanding and use of language - Learning - Mobility - Self-direction - Capacity for independent living - Economic self -sufficiency An individual with an int ellectual/developmental disability must also be found to meet the federal LOC requirements for admission into an ICF/IID and be approved for entrance into the waiver program before receiving waiver -funded services through an Indiana Medicaid HCBS waiver pr ogram operated by the DDRS. See Section 5.3: Initial Level of Care Evaluation for details. Section 4.3: Cost Neutrality Indiana must demonstrate that average per capita expenditure for the FS W and CIH Waiver program individuals is equal to or less than the average per capita expenditures of institutionalization for the same population. Indiana must demonstrate this cost neutrality for each waiver separately. Section 4.4: Coordination With Medicaid State Plan Services The CMS requires that an HCBS waiver member exhaust all services on the State Plan before utilizing HCBS waiver services. HCBS waiver programs are considered funding of last resort and have a closed funding stream. See Section 3.2: Medicaid Prior Authorization and Funding Streams for more specific information.

Indiana's MFP program provides Medicaid HCBS to indivi duals residing in a range of community settings as an alternative to care in an ICF/IID. An applicant must be living in a qualifying Medicaid institution or facility to be eligible for Indiana's MFP program. To apply for Indiana's MFP program, the applica nt must be a resident of a qualifying institution/facility for at least 60 consecutive days or more . The applicant must have needs that can be met safely through services available in the community . Also, the applicant must meet the minimum requirements fo r a funding source that is currently partnering with Indiana's MFP program. These funding sources currently include the CIH Waiver, FSW, Aged & Disabled (A&D) Waiver , and the Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Waiver. An Indiana MFP participant completes their transition and enters the participation phase of the program on the day they are discharged from the qualifying institution/facility and begin living in the community. Participation in Indiana's MFP program lasts for 365 participation days. At the end of t he 365 participation days in the MFP program, funding for the supports received by the participant will seamlessly change from MFP to the partnering funding source for which the participant is eligible and that they have chosen. See the Money Follow s the Person page at in.gov/fssa for more information. Goals and Objectives The MFP program accomplishes the following: Improves the delivery of home- and community -based services (HCBS) Enhances the ability of Medicaid programs to provide H CBS Increases the use of HCBS and reduces the use of institutionally based services Establishes and implements procedures to provide quality assurance and improve s HCBS The DDRS has also established My Friend & Peer, a 1:1 peer mentoring support specifically designed to provide friendship and natural support for individuals transitioning out of skilled nursing facility settings to increase the likelihood of their success in the community. These MFP participants are offered peer mentoring throughout their MFP 365 participation days .

Also presented are the activities that take place after an individual is approved for one of the waiver programs. Section 5.1: Request for Application An individual or the individual's guardian may apply for the FS W or the CIH Waiver program through the local Division of Disability and Rehabilitative Services (DDRS) Bureau of Developmental Disabilities Services (BDDS) office. An individual or the individual's guardian ha s the right to apply witho ut questions or delay. To apply for BDDS services, including the FSW or CIH Waiver , the individual or guardian now has two options available. The first option is to use the BDDS Gateway, an online application available 24 hours a day, seven days a week where individuals and families seeking may submit an application for services. The BDDS Gateway may be accessed at: Bddsgateway.fssa.in.gov . The second option is to complete, sign and date an Application for Developmental Disability Services (State Form 55068 [8-12]), which is available on the DDRS Forms page at in.gov/fssa/ddrs . The form may be completed as a fillable PDF or handwritten. The form must be printed, signed and returned to the local BDDS office via fax, mail or in -person delivery. Other individuals or agency representatives may help the individual or guardian complete the application and forward it to the BDDS office serving the county in which the individual currently resides. Upon receiving the waiver application, the BDDS staff must c ontact the individual and the individual's guardian and discuss the process for determining eligibility for the waiver (documentation of an intellectual/developmental disability, Medicaid eligibility and initial level of care [LOC] ). If the applicant is not a Medicaid member , they are referred to the local Division of Family Resources (DFR) office to apply for Medicaid. Applicants who have request ed, met and been approved for specific reserved waiver capacity (priority) criteria for entrance into the CIH Waiver program are advised of those services and the availability of a funded priority slot. See Section 5.6: Entrance into the Community Integration and Habilitation Waiver Program for details. Section 5.2: Medicai d Eligibility Note: Member guidance is included in this section for provider reference. Applicants under the age of 18 should submit the plan of care/service plan (POC/ service plan ) approval letter (see Section 5.8: State Authorization of the Initial POC/ Service Plan ) to the Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA) Division of Family Resources ( DFR ) when submitting an application for Medicaid benefits or when requesting a change of Medicaid Aid Category to qualify for waiver eligibility. Note: Medicaid eligibility is required before starting waiver services. See the Apply for Coverage page at in.gov/medicaid/members for instructions on how to apply for Medicaid. DDRS HCBS Waivers Section 5: Application and Start of Waiver Services 30 Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 Section 5.3: Initial Level of Care Evaluation An individual targeted for the FSW or who meet s reserved waiver capacity ( priority) criteria and is approved for entrance into the FSW or CIH Waiver program, must meet the level of care (LOC) required for placement in an intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities (ICF/IID). All LOC determinations r equire secondary review to ensure accuracy. Initial LOC determinations are made by a BDDS service coordinator , including a new \"initial\" LOC for individuals who have been terminated from the Home - and Community -Based Services ( HCBS ) waiver program but desi re to return to waiver services within the same waiver year . Reevaluations are performed by the selected provider of case management services. For those applicants whose initial LOC evaluation was unfavorable, the information is submitted to the BDDS Central Office for a tertiary review. The FSSA Office of Medicaid Policy and Planning (OMPP) retains final authority for determination o f eligibility. Only individuals ( state employees) who are Qualified Intellectual Disability Professionals (QIDP), as specified by the standard in Code of Federal Regulations 42 CFR 483.430(a ), may perform initial LOC determinations . If collateral records are not available or are not valid reflections of the individual, additional assessments may be obtained from cont racted psychologists, physicians, nurses and licensed social workers. Following review of the collateral records, the L OC assessment tool applicable to individuals with intellectual/developmental disabilit ies and other related conditions is completed to ascertain if the individual meets ICF/IID LOC. The LOC assessm ent tool is used for: - Reviewing and referencing documentation related to the intellectual/developmental disabili ties of the applicant or individual , as well as any psychiatric diagnosis and results of the individual's intellectual assessment - Recording age of on set - Identifying areas of major life activity in which the individual may exhibit a substantial functional limitation, including the areas of mobility, understanding and use of language, self-care, capacity for independent living, learning, self -direction, economic self -sufficiency , and the state definition of developmental disability found in Indiana Code IC 12 -7-2-61 The BDDS service coordinator (initial LOC) or selected provider of case manage ment (reevaluations) reviews the LOC assessment tool and collateral material applicable to individuals with intellectual/developmental disabilit ies and other related conditions to ascertain whether the individual meets ICF/IID LOC requirements. An applicant or individual must meet requirements for three of six substantial functional limitations and each of four basic conditions (list s follow) to meet LOC criteria. - The basic conditions are : Intellectual disability , cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism o r other condition (other than a sole diagnosis of mental illness) similar to intellectual disability The intellectual disability or other related condition is expected to continue indefinitely . The intellectual disability or other related condition had an age of onset prior to age 22 . The intellectual disability or other related condition results in substantial functional limitations in at least three major life activities . - The substantial functional limitation categories, as defined in 42 CFR 435.1010 , are: Self-care Learning Self-direction Capacity for independ ent living Section 5: Application and Start of Waiver Services DDRS HCBS Waivers Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 31 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 Understanding and use of language Mobility - After the evaluation is complete, a LOC decision letter is sent to the individual or legal guardian . Each LOC decision letter provides a Right to Appeal Notice explaining the individual 's right to appeal the decision as well as how to file an appeal. For more on appeals, see Section 8: Appeals Process in this module. Section 5.4: Waiting List for the Family Supports Waiver (FSW) The BDDS policy states individuals may be placed on a single statewide waiting list after applying for waiver services and meeting specified criteria. Individuals are responsible for maintaining current collateral and co ntact information with their local BDDS office. Initial Placement on a Single, Statewide Home - and Community - Based Services Waiver Waiting List For initial placement on a single, statewide HCBS waiver waiting list, the following requirements must be met: An individual or their legal representative must comp lete an application and submit the application to their local BDDS office to apply for HCBS waiver services.

Responsibilities of Individuals on a Waiting List Individuals on a waiting list have the following responsibilities: An individual, or an individual's legal representative, is expected to maintain current contact information with their local B DDS office. This information include s any change in address or telephone number If, after a reasonable number of attempts , the BDD S is unable to make contact with an individual or the individual's legal guardian, and the identified secondary contact person, by mail or telephone, the individual may be removed from a waiting list Section 5.5: Targeting Process for the Family Supports Waiver (FSW) When a slot becomes available under the FSW, an individual on a single statewide waiting list will receive a letter from the B DDS Central Office, asking the individual to do the following: Accept or decline the waiver slot within 30 calendar da ys Apply for Medicaid if they haven't already done so Provide or obtain confirmation of their diagnosis from a physician on the Confirmation of Diagnosis (State Form 54727) , available from the DDRS Forms page at in.gov/fssa/ddrs A response accepting or declining the waiver slot must be received by the state within 30 days . Individuals may be eligible to enter into FSW waiver services by meeting one of the speci fic priority criteria of the following reserved waiver capacity categories: Individuals ages 18 through 24 who have aged out of, graduated from, or permanently separated from their scho ol setting may be eligible to enter waiver services under the FSW on that separation, if funded slots are available Eligible children who are either: - A child of an active member/veteran of the armed forces of the United States, defined in IC-5-9-4-2 - A child of an active member/veteran of the National Guard If an individual declines the offer for an FSW slot, their name is removed from a single statewide waiting list. Section 5: Application and Start of Waiver Services DDRS HCBS Waivers Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 33 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 If an individual accepts the offer for a n FSW slot: An \"intake \" meeting with a service coordinator from the local B DDS District Office is scheduled for the B DDS to complete the following: - Collateral information, provided by the individual, is reviewed . - LOC is again established. The individual and/or any legal guardian must obtain con firmation of the individual's diagnosis on a Confirmation of Diagnosis (State Form 54727) , signed by the individual's physician within 21 calendar days from date of the letter. The individual and/or any legal guardia n has 60 calendar days to apply for and obtain Medicaid if the individual does not yet have Medicaid coverage. If the individual already has Medicaid coverage, but the aid category to which the individual's Medicaid eligibility has been assigned is not com patible with waiver program requirem ents, they have 30 calendar days from the date on the contact letter from the B DDS to request that the DFR process the needed change in Medicaid aid category. The individual or guardian must cooperate fully with requests related to the application for Medi caid eligibility and any change needed in the Medicaid aid category. After all assessments have been made, applicants under the age of 18 and their legal guardians are given a provider choice list by the BDDS contain ing providers of selective contracting case management services that are approved by the DDRS. Because parental income is not factored into a minor receiving waiver services , proof of an approved POC/ service plan may be required before some minors can obtain Medicaid eligibility . For that reason, the BDDS service coordinator creates an initial POC/ service plan , although selection of a case manage ment organization is still required. The case manage ment organization is cited on the initial POC/ service plan if the selection has been finalized but may also be added at a later date if necessary. For adults, generating the case management choice list and choosing a select ive contracting case management organization does not occur until after all eligibility criteria are met, including establishing Medicaid eligibility in a waiver -compatible aid category. Thereafter, the applicant or guardian (if applicable ) completes the service planning process and chooses service provid ers for any other selected services , and the case manager submits a POC/ service plan for waiver service. The timely completion of requirements for the PCI SP and service plan should be done through the BDDS Portal 2.0 at bddsportal.fssa.in.gov : Initial PCISPs are due 45 calendar days following the confirmation date of the initial service plan at a minimum. Annual PCISPs are due on o r before the start date of the plan year. Revisions to PCISPs are due within seven calendar days of the Individualized Support Team (IST) meeting, face -to-face visit or conversation in which the desire or need for revision is identified. Update d PCISPs are required in any of the following situations : - When th e needs or circumstances of the individual changes - When services are added or removed - When requested by the individual and/or legal representative - For nonan nual team meetings to record team discussion on outcomes and any related plan changes Annual service plans are due 45 calendar days prior to the end of the current plan year.

Individuals are responsible for maintaining current collateral and contact information with their local B DDS office. Application for a CIH Waiver Priority Slot When application for a CIH Waiver priority slot is made, p riority access by reserved waiver capacity category is made available only as long as available capacity exists for the current waiver year. Responsibilities of Individuals Applying for a CIH Waiver Priority Slot The responsibilities of an individual apply ing for a CIH Waiver priority slot are as follows: An individual or an individual's legal representative is expected to maintain current contact information with the individual's local B DDS office, including changes in address or telephone number If the B DDS attempts to contact an individual or the individual's legal guardian or the identified secondary contact person, and is unable to make contact by mail or telephone, the individual will forfeit the current opportunity for a CIH Waiver priority slot, but may reapply at any time If an individual or their legal representative declines placement offered through a funded CIH Waiver priority slot, the individual's application for the CIH Waiver is denied. If an individual or an individual's legal representative accepts placement through the offer of a funded CIH Waiver priority slot, an intake meeting with a service coordinator from the BDDS must occur . During t he intake meeting , collateral information provided by the indi vidual is reviewed and LOC is again established: A LOC assessment tool is completed. The allocation is recorded in the state's electronic case management system. The individual or guardian must obtain confirmation of the individual's diagnosis on a Confirmation of Diagnosis (State Form 54727) signed by the ind ividual's physician within 21 calendar days from the date on the BDDS letter offering a CIH Waiver priority slot . The individual or guardian has 60 calendar days from the date on the BDDS letter to apply for and obtain Medicaid when the individual does not yet have Medicaid coverage. If the individual already has Medicaid co verage, but the aid category to which the individual's Medicaid eligibility has been assigned is not compatible with waiver program requirements, they have 30 calendar days from the date on the contact letter from the B DDS to request that the DFR process t he needed change in Medicaid aid category , if the applicant is eligible . The individual or guardian must cooperate fully with requests related to the application for Medicaid eligibility and any needed change in Medicaid aid category. After all assessments have been made, the BDDS gives applicants younger than the age of 18 and their legal guardians a choice list of case management providers that are approved by the DDRS and enrolled through the IHCP to provide select ed contracting case management service s. Due to the disregard of parental income DDRS HCBS Waivers Section 5: Application and Start of Waiver Services 36 Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 for minors receiving waiver services, proof of a POC/ service plan may be required before some minors can obtain Medicaid eligibility.

Otherwise, selection of a DDRS -approved provider of contracted case management services is required before the POC/ service plan can be created. For adults, generating the B DDS case management organi zation choice list and selecting a case management organization does not occur until after all eligibility criteria are met, including establishing Medicaid eligibility in a waiver -compatible aid category. Thereafter, the applicant or guardian (if applicab le) completes the service planning process and chooses service providers for any other selected services , and the case manage ment provider submits a POC/ service plan for waiver service.

If the individual is unable to start CIH Waiver services wi thin the given time frames, the individual may be removed from the process, resulting in the available CIH Waiver priority slot being offered to another individual in need of services. The individual must work with the local BDDS office if additional time is needed to complete any required steps in the process. Section 5.7: Initial Plan of Care (POC) /Service Plan Development The state monitors and recently enhanced its person -centered planning process to ensure compliance with CMS 2249 -F and CMS 2296 -F. The new person -centered individualized support plan ( PCISP ) approach enhances the way in which supports and services are explained to individuals and families so that their needs, aspirat ions and opportunities for the achievement of self -determination, interdependence, productivity, integration and inclusion in all facets of community life can be identified and explored. Additionally, the PCISP drives the development of the POC/ service pla n. The PCISP is the new plan that identifies the array of services and supports, paid and unpaid from all sources that will be used to implement desired outcomes and ensure the individual 's health and welfare while the POC/ service plan identifies those supports and services which are funded by the waiver. T he individual , case manager , selected providers and other persons chosen by the individual form the IST. The individual has the right and power to command and direct the entire PCISP process with focus on their preferences, aspirations and needs. The process empowers individuals to create life plans and direct the planning and allocation of resources to meet their self-directed life goals. The POC/ service plan is developed by the individual -chosen case manager a minimum of six weeks prior to the initial start date of services and then six weeks prior to the end date of each annual service plan. The POC/ service plan is routinely developed to cover a time frame of 12 consecutive months. Section 5: Application and Start of Waiver Services DDRS HCBS Waivers Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 37 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 While the FSW is capped at $ 19,614 annually for each individual , budgeted amounts for POC/ service plans developed under the CIH Waiver use the objective -based allocation process described in Section 6 : Objective -Based Allocatio n. Coordination of waiver services and other services is completed by the case manager . Within 30 days of implementation of the plan, the case manager is responsible for ensuring that all identified services and supports have been implemented as identified in the PCISP and the POC/ service plan . The case manager is responsible for monitoring and coordinating services on an ongoing basis and is required to record a case note for each encounter with , or on behalf of , the individual . A formal 90 -day review is also completed by the case manager using information received from the individual , family or guardian as applicable, and other IST members before, duri ng and after the face -to-face visit or IST meeting . The IST is advised of any concerns or needs for updates that may require scheduling of additional team meetings by the case manager . Most waiver service providers are required to submit a quarterly report summarizing the level of support provided to the individual , based on the identified supports and services in the PCISP and the POC/ service plan . As part of the 90 -day review process, the case manager reviews these reports for consistency with the PCISP and POC/ service plan and works with providers as needed to address findings from this review. Section 5.8: State Authorization of the Initial POC/ Service Plan The case manager transmits the POC/ service plan electronically to the state's waiver specialist, who reviews the POC/ service plan and confirms that the individual is a current Medicaid member in one of the following categories: Aged (MA A) Blind (MA B) Low-income families (MA GF) Disabled (MA D) Disabled worker (MADW , MADI ) Children receiving adoption assista nce or children receiving federal foster care payments under Title IV E - Sec 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(I) of the Act (MA 4 , MA 8) Children receiving adoption assistance under a state adoption agreement - Sec 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(VIII) (MA 8) Independent foster care adolescents - Sec 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XVII) (MA 14) Children under age 1 - Sec 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV) (MA Y) Children age 1 to 5 - Sec 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VI) (MA Z) Children age 1 through 18 - Sec 19 02(a)(10)(A)(i)(VII) (MA 9 , MA 2) Transitional medical assistance - Sec 1925 of the Act (MA F) Note that for the a ged, blind or disabled in Sec 1634 states such as Indiana : Supplemental Security Income (SSI) -eligible individuals will be automatically enrolled in the Indiana Heal th Coverage Programs (IHCP) and will not need to file a separate Indiana Application for Health Coverage . Members with SSI will be assigned to the new Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) eligibility aid category. Individuals deemed disabled by the Social Security Administration and who are receiving SSI based on that determination will not be required to undergo a separate determination of disability from Indiana's Medical Review Team (MRT). DDRS HCBS Waivers Section 5: Application and Start of Waiver Services 38 Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 Individuals who receiv e Social Security Disability Income (SSDI) will not be required to undergo a separate determination of disability from Indiana's MRT. A financial eligibility review will still be required, so these individuals will need to complete the Indiana Applicati on for Health Coverage . The waiver specialist also confirms the following: The individual has a current ICF/IID LOC approval . The individual has been targeted for an available waiver slot . The individual's identified needs are addressed with a plan to assure their health, safety and welfare . The individual or guardian has signed, indicating acceptance of the POC/ service plan , that they have been offered choice of DDRS -approved waiver service providers and that they have chosen waiver services over services in an institution. The waiver specialist may request additional information from the case manager to assist in reviewing the POC/ service plan . If the waiver specialist approves the initial POC/ service plan , the initial approval letter and signed service authorization are electronically transmitted to the case manager , BDDS (for initial POC/ service plans only) and service providers. Within three calendar days of receiving the initial POC/ service plan approval letter and service authorization , the case manager must provide copies of the approval letter, signed service authorization and addendum (containing information from the POC/ service plan ) to the individual or guardian. The individual's chosen waiver service providers are required to register so that they receive the service authorization and the addendums electronically. Service Authorization The service authorization serves as the official authorization for service delivery and reimbursement : If the waiver specialist approves the POC/ service plan pending Medicaid eligibility or change of aid category (for minors onl y), disenrollment of a child from Hoosier Healthwise, facility discharge or other reasons, the pending approval letter is to be transmitted to the case man ager, the B DDS and the service providers. The case manager must notify the individual or guard ian within their calendar days of receipt of the pending approval and provide a copy of the initial approval letter naming the pending conditions. No service authorization is generated until all pending issues are resolved and a final approval letter is released. If the wai ver specialist denies the i nitial POC/ service plan , a denial letter must be transmitted to the case manager , the B DDS (for initial and annual POC/ service plans only) and service providers. Within three calendar days of receipt of the denial, the case manager must provide a copy of the service authorization , the appeal rights as an HCBS waiver services recipient, and an explanation of the decision to de ny to the individual or guardian . The case manager discusses other service options with the individual and guardian, unless the indivi dual or guardian files an appeal. Note: After waiver services begin, waiver individuals are sometimes referred to as \"beneficiaries\" or \"members \" for Medicaid purposes . Section 5.9: Initial Service Plan Implementation An individual cannot begin waiver services under the FSW program or the CIH Waiver program before the approval of the initial POC/ service plan by the state's waiver specialist. The initial POC/ service plan represents the service plan identified for the ind ividual resul ting from the PCISP development process . If the waiver specialist issues an initial approval letter pending certain conditions being met, those conditions must be resolved before the start of the individual's waiver services. For applicants un der the age of 18, if the individual's Medicaid eligibility is approved pending waiver approval, the case manager notifies the local Section 5: Application and Start of Waiver Services DDRS HCBS Waivers Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 39 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 DFR caseworker when the waiver has been approved. The DFR caseworker and waiver case manager coordinate the Medicaid eligib ility date and waiver start date. If Medicaid eligibility depends on eligibility for the waiver, the Medicaid start date is usually the first day of the month following approval of the POC/ service plan . If an individual is in a Hoosier Healthwise , Hoosier Care Connect or Medicaid managed care program, the case manager must contact the local DFR caseworker to coordinate the managed care program stop date and waiver services start date. Individuals receiving the IHCP hospice benefit do not have to disenroll f rom the hospice benefit to receive waiver services that are not related to the terminal condition and are not duplicative of hospice care. If applicable, the case manager and managed care benefit advocate must inform the individual and individual's parent or guardian of their options to ensure they make an informed choice. When the POC/ service plan is approved by the wa iver specialist pending facility discharge, the waiver start date can be the same day that the individual is discharged from the facility. Following discharge from the facility and within three calendar days after the individual begins waiver services, the case manager must complete the Confirmation of Waiver Start form in the I nsite database and electronically transmit it to the state through the DDRS I nsite database. For all waiver starts, when the case manager completes the Confirmation of Waiver Start form in the I nsite database and electronically transmits it to the DDRS database, the FSSA is also electronically notified to enter the individual's waiver start information in the Core Medicaid Management Information System (Core MMIS ) database. When the Confirmation of Waiver Start form is received electronically by the DDRS, the form is reviewed and, if accepted, an approval letter is automatically transmitted back to the case manager . The period covered by the initial POC/ service plan is from the effective date of the confirmation form through the end date of the initial POC/ service plan that was previously approved by the waiver s pecialist. Within three calendar days of receiving the initial POC/ service plan approval letter and signed service authorization , the case manager must provide copies of the approval letter, signed service authorization and addendum (containing information from the POC/ service plan ) to the individual or guardian. The individual's chosen waiver service providers are required to register so they receive the service authorization and the addendums electronically. There is no rei mbursement for services delivered before receipt of the service authorization . Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 41 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 Section 6: Objective -Based Allocation This section presents the objective -based allocation (OBA) methodology that the Family and Social Security Administration (FSSA) Division of Disability and Rehabilitative Services (DDRS) uses to determine the level of supports an individual needs to live in a community setting while receiving services under the Community Integration and Habilitation (CIH ) Waiver. Section 6.1: OBA Development In 2007, the DDRS and an exter nal group of stakeholders consisting of advocates, providers and industry professionals began the research and development of an OBA method. The development included baseline research, pr ovider cost reporting, modeling, assessment v alidation, pilots and best practices. Modeling was use d to determine the parameters for Algorithm development (Algo). As is further explained in the following section , the OBA is determined by combining the over all Algo (determined by the Inventory for Client and Agency Planning [ICAP ] and the ICAP addendum), age, employment and living arrangement. Note: The OBA methodology is not used with the already -capped Family Supports Waiver (FSW) . Section 6.2: ICAP Assessment and Algo Level Development The nationally recognized ICAP was selected to be the pri mary tool for individual assessment. The ICAP assessment determines an individual's level of functioning for broad independence and general maladaptive factors. The ICAP addendum, commonly referred to as the behavior and health factors, determines an indiv idual's level of functioning on behavior and health factors. These two assessments determine an individual's overall Algo level, which can r ange from 0 -6. Algos 0 and 6 are considered outliers , representing those who are the lowest and the highest on both e nds of the functioning spectrum. Upon review, the state may manually adjust the designation of an individual from an Algo 5 to an Algo 6. A lthough this individual continues receiving the Algo 5 budget, the Algo 6 designation indicates a need for additional o versight of the individual. The stakeholder group designed a building -block grid to build the allocations. The building -block grid was developed with the following tenets playing key roles: Focus on daytime programming Employment Community integration Housemates The OBA's total allocation is then determined by combining the overall Algo (determined by the ICAP and ICAP addendum), age, empl oyment and living arrangement. It should be noted that for any individual who is living alone, the OBA is based on a shared living model. Section 6.5: Long -Term Budget Request and Short -Term Budget Request addresses potential adjustments to the allocation amount.

Table 1 - Algo Level Descriptors Level Descriptor 0 (Low) Algo level zero (0): (A) high level of independence with few supports needed; (B) no significant behavioral issues; and (C) requires minimal residential habilitation services. 1 (Basic) Algo level one (1): (A) moderately high level of independence with fe w supports needed; (B) behavioral needs, if any, can be met with medication or informal direction by caregivers through the Medicaid State Plan services; and (C) likely a need for day programming and light residential habilitation services to assist with certain tasks, but the individual can be unsupervised for much of the day and night. 2 (Regular) Algo level two (2): (A) moderate level of independence with frequent supports needed; (B) behavioral needs, if any, can be met with medication or light t herapy, or both, every one (1) to two (2) weeks ; (C) does not require twenty -four (24) hours a day supervision; and (D) generally able to sleep unsupervised, but needs structure and routine throughout the day. 3 (Moderate) Algo level three (3): (A) requir es access to full -time supervision for medical or behavioral, or both, needs; (B) twenty -four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week staff availability ; (C) behavioral and medical supports are not generally intense; and (D) behavioral and medical supports can be provided in a shared staff setting. 4 (High) Algo level four (4): (A) requires access to full -time supervision for medical or behavioral, or both, needs: (i) twenty -four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week frequent staff interact ion; and (ii) requires line of sight support; and (B) has moderately intense needs that can generally be provided in a shared staff setting. 5 (Intensive) Algo level five (5): (A) requires access to full -time supervision with twenty -four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week absolute line of sight support; (B) needs areintense; (C) needs require the full attention of a caregiver with a one -to-one staff to individual ratio; and (D) typically only needed by those with intense behavioral needs, not medical needs alone. 6 (High Intensive) Algo level six (6): (A) requires access to full -time supervision: (i) twenty -four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week; and (ii) more than a one -to-one staff to individual ratio; (B) needs are exceptional ; (C) needs require more than one (1) caregiver exclusively devoted to the individual for at least part of each day; and (D) imminent risk of individual harming self or others, or both, without vigilant supervision. Section 6: Objective -Based Allocation DDRS HCBS Waivers Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 43 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 Section 6.4: Translating Algo Level Into a Budget Allocation Based on the Algo level , age and living arrangement, overall/total budget allocations have been established by taking a predetermined baseline from that Algo level group to calculate a dollar am ount for each of three categories of funds : Other/Residential Habilitation and Support (RHS )* Behavioral Support Services (BMAN ) Day services (DAYS ) While the calculation for the overall budget is calculated using the three categories , the way in which the allocation is spent is not dedicated to the buckets/categories . Individuals may use their total allocation with flexibility to support their community i ntegration needs identified through the person -centered planning process. After th e ICAP and ICAP addendum assessments (described in Section 6.2: ICAP Assessment and Algo Level Development ) are completed and the information is received by the state. Individuals in the CIH Waiver program and their support teams are required to review the information and ensure that it accurately reflects them. Upon completion of their review, individuals and their support teams are notified of their OBA through their case manager s. Individual tea ms may request a formal review of their allocations through their case manager s. Teams are asked to review the ICAP and ICAP addendum and provide supporting documentation to substantiate an individual's need for placement in a different Algo level. The sup porting documentation is reviewed, as are the PCISPs , behavior -support plans, risk plans and any other collateral documentation needed to analyze the individual's Algo level. *Note: RHS funding amounts come from the budget category referred to as \"Other,\" because that category must also cover all other (non -BMAN and non -DAYS) services, such as environmental modifications, vehicle modifications, specialized medical equipment and supplies, personal emergency response systems, family and caregiver training, el ectronic monitoring , and so on, when and if these other services are selected by the individual and the individual support team (IST) . While the total allocation is still established by using the three categories, these funds are no longer dedicated within specific categories. Table 2 shows an example of how the total budget allocation was derived for the categories of individual s 19-24 years of age not attending school and individuals over the age of 25 , using the service hours defined in 460 IAC 13 -5-2 and the rates that were in effect as of October 2017 . The example below indicates the components of the allocation amounts, but the combination of an individual's living arrangement and Algo level determines which budget amount (Total Allocation) the individuals may use when selecting the services required to meet their needs. As explained in the additional information box above, the total allocation may now be used outside of the established categories .

The Long -Term Budget Request (LTBR) Previously known as the Budget Review Questionnaire, or BRQ, and applicable only to the CIH Waiver program, a Long -Term Budget Request (LTBR ) is a set of qualifying questions, responses and supporting documentation used to determine why a budget review is necessary. The LTBR and responses are submitted by the individual's case manager based on information provided by the IST. Adjustments to the allocation amount may also occur when the individual has a change in needs. The IST may request reviews of the assigned allocation through their case manager s via a LTBR . The IST must first evaluate the needs of the individual who is receiving services an d experiences a qualifying event. A qualifying event is defined as one or more of the following events: The IST identifie s that the individual's needs are not being met through shared staffing . The individual complete s their education . The IST believes the Algo level is incorrect . A health or medical condition prevents the individual from attending day programs . The IST believes that the Wellness Coordination Health score is inaccurate and needs to be reviewed . An individual's behavior al conditions change . The IST believes the ICAP assessment has significant errors . The IST believes the ICAP addenda (behavioral and health factors) are incorrect . Next, the IST must review the functional assessment findings and, if it finds that the individual needs increased suppor t, provide the individual's case manager with supporting documentation to justify a review of the individual's budget allocation. The waiver case manager must submit the LTBR to the Bureau of Developmental Disabilities Services (BDDS) with the following documentation based on the specific qualifying event : The IST identifie s that the individual's needs are not being met through shared staffing . - An explanation of why it is not feasible for the individual to share staffing or live with housem ates The individual completes their education . - A copy of certificate of completion or other documentation from school noting the final date for attendance The IST believes the A lgo level is incorrect . - The IST's review of the ICAP assessment with detailed n otes on areas needing reviewed - The medical and behavioral documentation needed to update t he addendum Health or medical condition prevents the individual from attending day programs . - Documentation from a medical professional outlining why the condition negates a day program, the duration of the condition and risk factors to consider Section 6: Objective -Based Allocation DDRS HCBS Waivers Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 47 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 The IST believes that the Wellness Coordination Health score is inaccurate and needs to be reviewed . - Documentation from a medical professional outlining the change in conditio n or diagnosis, with an anticipated duration of the condition, risk factors to consider and any other special considerations An individual's behavioral conditions change . - A copy of the behavioral su pport plan - Monthly documentation support ing the change in condition(s) - Incident reports The IST believes the ICAP assessment has significant errors . - The IST's review of the ICAP assessment with detailed notes on areas needing reviewed - The medical and b ehavior documentation needed to update the a dden dum The IST believes the ICAP addenda (behavioral and health factors) are incorrect . - Documentation from a medical professional outlining the change in condition or diagnosis, with an anticipated duration of the condition, risk factors to consider and a ny other special considerations : A copy of the behavioral support plan Monthly documentation supporting the change in condition(s) Incident reports When requested, the LTBR and supporting documentation and information are reviewed by the waiver specialist with the BDDS . The waiver specialist may request additional information from the case manager to support the LTBR and may allocate funding above the OBA determination for a period of up to 90 days while waiting for the additional documentation that is need ed. If, after 90 days, the case manager fails to provide the requested additional information for the waiver specialist , the request to modify the individual's budget may be denied. However, when all needed supporting documentation is provided, the waiver specialist determines the individual's Algo score based on that information. If the individual's Algo level has changed, a new Algo and corresponding budget allocation is entered into the state's case management system. The waiver specialist will notify t he waiver case manager of any changes in the Algo or allocation . An individual who is dissatisfied with the waiver specialist 's determination may appeal the service authorization within 33 days of the date of the notice. During an appeal, the BDDS maintain s the budget from the last agreed -upon budget allocation. An individual or the individual's legal representative may appeal the Algo if they feel the Algo level is inaccurate.

The Short -Term Budget Request (STBR) Previously known as the Budget Modification Request, or BMR, the Short -Term Budget Request (STBR) allows individuals on the CIH Waiver to obtain additional funds for a short -term whe n the individual experiences an unanticipated event that requires a higher budget to meet their needs. If the IST identifies one or more of the unanticipated events listed below that it believes increases the short - term needs of the individual, it shall contact the individual's waiver case manager or residential provider to request a STBR . The individual's case manager is responsible for submitting the initial STBR . Upon rec eipt of a request from the IST, the waiver case manager should complete the STBR and attach all required documentation in the BDDS case management system. If approved, the increased budget shall not exceed 180 days. STBR s must be filed within 45 calendar d ays of the event or status change . A residential provider may submit an STBR ; however, the HCBS waiver case manager must review and submit it to the BDDS. DDRS HCBS Waivers Section 6: Objective -Based Allocation 48 Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 The following timeline for filing a STBR appears in the Short -Term Budget Request Timeline policy . Although provider s, individuals and support teams do not have to follow this exact timeline, the process must be completed within 45 calendar days of the qualifying event: An event or status lasting longer than 14 consecutive days is eligible for STBR review by the waiver specialist with the BDDS . The provider notifies the individual's case manager of the identified status change within seven days of identification of a 14 -consecutive -day event or status , resulting in a potential need for budget modification. The residential provider or the case manager may submit a request for a STBR. If a provider submits the request for an STBR, upon receipt the case manager will review th e request and either request additional information or submit to the BDDS within 14 calendar days. The case manager coordinates and documents with the individual's IST of the proposed modification within 14 calendar days of receipt of the notice from the i dentif ying provider. The case manager collects and submit s STBR information and request within 10 calendar days of the meeting with the individual's team via the format and required documentation noted in the current BDDS data entry system. The individual's BDDS district office must provide an initial response to the team's STBR within seven calendar days of receipt. The BDDS central office must provide an initial response within seven calendar days of the district office's approval of the re quest. Unanticipated events defined in the STBR policy include : Loss of a housemate due to: - Death - Extended ho spitalization of 14 or more days - Nursing facility respite stay of 14 or more days - Incarceration of 14 or more days - Substantiated abuse, neglec t or exploitation - Needed intervention for behavioral needs - Needed intervention for health or medical needs - Inability to share staffing Loss of employment State substantiated abuse, neglect or exploitation Behavioral needs requiring intervention Extra ordinary health or medical needs requiring intervention Documentation requirements for STBR s include, but are not limited to, the following: For STBR s resulting from needed intervention for behavior al needs, documentation should include the following : - Docum entation of behavior data for past 30 to 90 days - Documen tation regarding changes to the individual's behavior plan that have alr eady occurred prior to the submission of the STBR Note: If the IST anticipates that the behaviors will last longer than 90 days, the waiver case manager should complete a LTBR instead of the STBR .

The following is a no n-exhaustive list of potential alternative support options: - Shared staffing with housemates - Electronic monitoring services - Medicaid prior authorization (PA) services - Family a nd community supports The residential provider or waiver case manager may submit an additional STBR with supporting documentation and ongoing status reports on a month -to-month basis , not to exceed a period of 180 days from the initial unanticipated event if a short -term budget is required after 90 days. An email notificati on is sent to providers when new STBR s are submitted by case manager s. The notification is sent to the service authorization email address of record for the provider and contain s the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA ) name of the i ndividual, the service the provider is currently authorized to provide, the month and year the STBR is intended to cover, and the associated PCISP . The BDDS responds to new STBR s within seven business days of submission. Final decisions on STBRs are not made until case manager s respond to all inquiries from the BDDS. The individual or legal guardian has the right to appeal any waiver -related decision of the state within 33 calendar days of the service authorization . A service authorization is issu ed with the release of each state decision pertaining to a PCISP .

Section 6.6: Implementation of Objective -Based Allocations The case manager for each individual participating in the CIH Waiver program receiv es the new OBA three months before the individual 's annual renewal date. The case manager must review the OBA with the individual and the individual's IST prior to the development of a new annual ser vice plan. If there has been a significant change in the life of the individual , with agreement of the IST, the case manager is responsible for requesting a LTBR (see Section 6.5: Long -Term Budget Request and Short -Term Budget Request ).

The LTBR states the reason for allocation review. The full list of acceptable reasons for allocation review is found in Section 6.5: Long -Term Budget Request and Short -Term Budget Request , and examples include: The IST believes the Algo level is incorrect . The IST believes the ICAP assessment has significant errors . The IST believes the ICAP addenda (behavioral and health factors) are incorrect . The LTBR is submitted by the case manager to the BDDS. The LTBR , supporting documentation and information are reviewed by the waiver specialist with the BDDS . The waiver specialist determines whether an individual's Algo score is supported based on the provided in formation. The BDDS reviews the LTBR within seven business days of submission. If additional documentation is needed , the waiver specialist may request that the individual's case manager submit additional information to support the LTBR . If, after 90 days, the case manager fails to provide the requested additional information, the waiver specialist shall deny the request to modify the individual's budget allocation. If the documentation provided with the LTBR is complete, the waiver specialist shall determi ne an individual's budget allocation and the duration of the budget allocation increase, and, if appropriate, determine a new Algo and budget allocation if it finds that the individual's Algo changed. The waiver specialist will notify the waiver case manag er of any changes in the Algo or allocation. If a change in the Algo score is appropriate, an update d PCISP must be submitted at the correct allocation level so that a n service authorization with appeal rights may be generated by the BDDS and distributed t o the individual through the waiver case manager . If the individual question s the indicated decision, the individual may discuss it with the case manager . An individual who is dissatisfied with the waiver specialist 's determination may appeal the service authorization within 33 days of the date of the notice. During the appeal, the BDDS shall maintain the budget from the last agreed -upon budget allocation. Note: LTBRs are not available under the FSW. The appeal process is located on the back pages of the service authorization and is also described in Section 8: Appeals Process in this module. Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 51 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 Section 7: Monitoring and Continuation of Waiver Services This section describes the di fferent processes that occur to monitor and continue waiver services. Section 7.1 : Level of Care Re evaluation The process for reevaluation of level of care (LOC) is the same as the initial evaluation process, except that a new confirmation of diagnosis for m is no longer required for each reevaluation. The reevaluation is typically performed by the waiver case management organization (CMO), as opposed to being performed by Division of Disability and Rehabilitative Services (DDRS) Bureau of Developmental Disabilities Services (BDDS) staff. However, under specific circumstances, such as potential denials of LOC , tertiary reevaluations may be completed by BDDS staff or by the DDRS Central Office. Reevaluation is required at least annu ally, or as needed. Family Supports Waiver (FSW) and Community Integration and Habilitation (CIH) Waiver program individuals must be reevaluated each year to m eet the LOC for intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilit ies (ICF/IID). Only individuals who are Qualified Intellectual Disability Professionals (QIDP) as specified by the federal standard within Code of Federal Regulations 42 CFR 483.430(a) , may perform LOC determinations. Section 7.2: Medicaid Eligibility Re determination The Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA) Division of Family Resources (DFR) is the group that determines eligibility for all Indiana social services programs. The DFR helps individuals determine which programs are right for them and their families. Individuals can learn more about the application process on the Apply for Coverage page at in.gov/medicaid/ members . Each year, the local DFR determines the individual's continuing eligibility to receive Medicaid. As ongoing Medicaid eligibility is required for participation in the FSW and CIH Waiver programs, Home - and Community -Based Services (HCBS ) providers must ensure the individuals served obtain/maintain Medicaid eligibility. Section 7.3: Annual Person -Centered Individualized Support Plan (PCISP) Development All individuals (also known as participants ) receiving waiver services must have a new person -centered individualized support plan (PCISP)/service authorization approved at least annually. The new PCISP planning approach enhances the way in which supports and services are explained to participants and families , so that their needs, aspirations, and opportunities to achieve self -determination, interdependence, productivity, integration and inclusion in all facets of community life , can be identified and explored. The PCISP is the new plan that ident ifies the array of services and supports, paid and unpaid from all sources that will be used to implement desired outcomes and ensure the individual 's health and welfare while the PCISP/service authorization identifies those supports and services which are funded by the waiver. The participant , case manager and others of the participant 's choosing f rom the Individualized Support Team (IST). The participant has the right and power to command and direct the entire PCISP process , with focus on their preference s, aspirations and needs. The process empowers participants to create DDRS HCBS Waivers Section 7: Monitoring and Continuation of Waiver Services 52 Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 life plans and allows the individual to direct the planning and allocation of resources to meet their self- directed life goals. The annual PCISP is developed by the participant working with their case manager a minimum of six weeks prior to the end date of each annual service plan. The PCISP is routinely developed to cover 12 consecutive months. The following apply to this process: Although the FSW is already capped a t $19,614 annually, budgeted amounts for PCISP s developed under the CIH Waiver use the objective -based allocation process described in Section 6: Objective - Based Allocation . Coordination of waiver services and other services is completed by the case manager . Within 30 days of implementation of the plan, the case manager is responsible for ensuring that all identified services and supports have been implemented as identified in the PCISP . The case manager is responsible for monito ring and coordinating services on an ongoing basis and is required to record a case note for each encounter with the participant . A formal 90 -day review is also completed by the case manager with the participant . The IST is advised of any concerns or needs for updates that may require scheduling of additional team meetings by the case manager . Most waiver service providers are required to submit a quarterly report summarizing the level of support provided to the individual based on the identified supports a nd services in the PCISP /service authorization . As part of the 90 -day review process, the case manager reviews these reports for consistency with the PCISP and POC/ service plan and works with providers as needed to address findings from this review. If an annual PCISP/service authorization is not submitted or cannot be approved in a timely manner, the most recently approved PCISP/service authorization is automatically converted to a new annual PCISP/service authorization . The total cost and amount of services on the \"auto -converted\" or \"default\" PCISP/service authorization is determined by the cost of services and supports appearing on the most recently approved but expiring PCISP/se rvice authorization . The auto -converted or default PCISP/service authorization ensures that there is no loss of services for the participant . The case manager is subsequently contacted and required to complete the annual person -centered planning process to update the PCISP and service authorization as needed. Risks are assessed during the PCISP process to help identify risks related to health*, behavior, safety and support needs for waiver participants . *Note: For the CIH Waiver , when individuals have state-assessed health scores of 5 or higher and opt to use the waiver's Wellness Coordination services, healthcare needs and associated risks are separately assessed and monitored by a registered nurse (RN) or licensed practical nurse (LPN) employed by the participant -chosen Wellness Coordination provider agency. The RN/LPN, who must be actively involved in all IST meetings, develops a Wellness Coordination Plan specific to the assessed healthcare needs and risks, sharing the plan with the IST. As descri bed in the service definition for Wellness Coordination services in Appendix C -1/C-3 of the CIH Waiver , the Wellness Coordinator's healthcare -related coordination and monitoring responsibilities vary according to the specified tier of Wellness Coordination services. However, as is true of all other waiver funded services, it is ultimately the responsibility of the waiver case manager to monitor and ensure that the Wellness Coordination activities occur as specified within the PCISP and service authorization . The PCISP/service authorization identifies the name of the waiver service, the name of the participant -chosen provider of that service, the cost of the service per unit, the number of units of service, and the start and end dates for each waiver service identified on the PCISP/service authorization .

Note that changes were implemented within the appeals process, moving administrative law judge (ALJ) offices from the Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA ) to a new Office of Administrative Law Proceedings (OALP). The ALJs are no longer employees of the FSSA. Appea ls are now submitted and processed as outlined in Sections 8.1 through 8.18 below. Interested parties may review the new OALP website at in.gov/oalp . The new physical location of the OALP is: Office of Administrative Law Proceedings 100 N. Senate Ave . Ste. N802 Indianapolis, I N 46204 Phone: 317-234-6689 Section 8.1: Appeal Request The following pertain to requests for appeal: An appeal is a request for a hearing before an ALJ with the OALP . The purpose of an appeal is to determine whether a decision made by a service coordinator, waiver speciali st, the Division of Disability and Rehabilitative Services (DDR S) Central Office , or other entities affecting the waiver applicant , waiver participant or provider was correct. An appeal request must be in writing and forwarded to the hearing authority. Service authorization is used to notify each Medicaid Home - and Co mmunity -Based Services (HCBS) applicant , waiver participant or prospective waiver participant of any action that affects their HCBS services , including : - Choice of HCBS as an alternative to institutional care - HCBS waiver service actions, including reduction, termination or denial of a service - Authorized services and service providers - Service authorization s generated for other reason such as the initial approval/denial of a service plan, updates to service plan, changes in allocation or objective -based allocation (OBA ), eligibility/ level of care (LOC ) changes and/or other issues decisions impacting waiver participation , contain appeal rights . Data Entry Worksheets (DEW s) related to the interruption, termination or withdrawal from HCBS waiver services may be appealed. Waivers may not be interrupted or terminated due to individual/family/guardian non -responsiveness without prior approval from BDDS. However, for waiver terminations due to institutionalization or dea th, the termination DEW entered by the case manager and accepted by the state autogenerates the service authorization . Medicaid benefits related to HCBS waivers, including determinations regarding LOC may be appealed. The L OC Decision Letter contains a Rig ht to Appeal Notice instructing the individual how to file an appeal when desired. Providers can find an explanation regarding an appellant's appeal rights and the opportunity for a fair hearing on the back of the service authorization . \"Your Right to Appeal and Have a Fair Hearing \" advises the appellant (the petitioner) who may be an applicant , waiver individual , prospective waiver individual or provider, of their right to appeal and the timeliness requirements associat ed with the right to appeal. \"How to Request an Appeal\" provides instructions regarding the procedures that are necessary in the appeal process, including the right of the appellant to authorize representation by an attorney, relative or other spokesperson on behalf of the appellant. DDRS HCBS Waivers Section 8: Appeal Process 60 Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 The case manager provides each individual and eligible prospective individual (as well as the individual's guardian or advocate, as appropriate ) with a copy of the service authorization along with an explanation of the right to appeal and to request a fair hea ring. When the case manager generates the PCISP/ service authorization and the PCISP/service authorization is authorized by the Bureau of Developmental Disabilities Services (BDDS ), a service authorization is generated and sent to the individual receiving HCBS waiver supports and/or the individual's legal representative . The service authorization specifies any adverse determination (when the individual is denied the services or the providers of their choice, or when actions are taken to deny, suspend, reduce or terminate services). The service authorization informs the individual (and the individual 's guardian or advocate, as appropriate) of their right to appeal the determination and also advises the individual that services will be con tinued if they file the appeal in a timely manner . Appeals must be received by the FSSA within 33 calendar days of the decision date noted on the service authorization . When a request for entrance into the Community Integration and Habilitation (CIH ) Waiver or the Family Support Waiver (FSW) program is denied, t he denial letter advises the applicant of their right to file an appeal with the OALP . Additionally, individuals of the CIH Waiver have the right to appeal the assessment used to determine the OBA amount.

Upon request, t he case manager may inform the individual on how to prepare the written request for appeal and fair hearing , including assisting the individual in preparing the written request for an appeal. The case manager may inform the individual of the required time frames and the address for submission of the appeal , The case manager can also provide an op portunity to discuss the issue being appealed . However, due to conflict -free case management requirements, the case manager may not file an appeal or appear at an appeal hearing on behalf of a waiver individual or service provider unless the case manager is the Medicaid authorized representative noted on the waiver individual or service provider 's record with the Division of Family Resources (DFR) , as doing so could result in a conflict of interest . The request for an appeal and a fair hearing should be recorded in a case note by the case manager , as well as recorded at the OALP . Section 8.2: Group Appeals The following pertain to group appeals: The OALP may respond to a series of requests for hearings by providing group hearings, o n similar questions or changes in federal or state law or regulation. Similarly, a group of individuals that wishes to appeal some aspect of policy may request to be heard as a group. If there is disagreement as to whether the issue is one of federal or state law, regulation , or the facts of an appellant' s personal situation, OALP makes the decision as to whether the appeal may be included in a group hearing. The ALJ may limit the discussion in a group hearing to the sole issue under appeal. When an appellant's request for a hearing adds issues to the (sole) issue serving as the basis for the group hearing, the appeal is handled as an individual hearing. An appellant scheduled for a group hearing may choose to withdraw and be granted an individual hearing, even if the matter under appeal is limited to the sole issue involved in the group hearing.

The BDDS activities include developing policy, conducting provider compliance reviews, investigating complaints, reviewin g mortality, and managing the state's automated system for reporting incidents of abuse, neglect and exploita tion. Information about the BDDS Quality Assurance Service s can be found on the BDDS Quality Assurance page at in.gov/fssa/ddrs , under Programs & Services. Section 9. 2: Incident Reports The BDDS and its authorized vendors are responsible for managing the DDRS Incident Reporting System. Providers are responsible for repo rting incidents through the state's web -based system, the Incident Review and Follow -up Reporting Tool (IFUR) accessible from the BDDS Incident Reporting page . Reportable incidents are defined as any event or occurrence characterized by risk or uncertainty resulting in or having the potential to result in significant harm or injury to an individual or death of an individual. According to Indiana Administrative Code (IAC) and the DDRS policy, the following types of events are reportable: Alleged, suspected or actual abuse, neglect or exploitation of an individual - This event includes physical, sexual, emotional/ verbal and domestic abuse. An incident in this category must also be reported to Adult Protective Services (APS) or Child Protection Services (CPS) , as applicable. The provider will suspend staff involved in an incident f rom duty , pending investigation by the provider. Peer-to-peer aggression that results in significant injury Death of an individual - A death shall also be reported to APS or CPS , as applicable. If death is a result of alleged criminal activity, the death must be reported to law enforcement . Structural or environmental issues with a service delivery site that compromise the health and safety of an individual ; fire that jeopardizes or compromises the health or welfare of an individual Elopement of an individual that results in evasion of required supervision as described in the PCISP , as necessary for the individual's health and welfare Missing person, when an individual wanders away and no one knows where they are Alleged, suspected or actual criminal activity by a staff member, employee, agent of a provider or an individual receiving services An emergency intervention for an individual resulting from a physical symptom, a medical or psychiatric condition, or any other event Injury to an individual when the origin or cause of the injury is unknown, and the injury requires medical evaluation or treatment A significant injury to an individual, including but not limited to: - A fracture - A burn greater than first degree - Choking that requires intervention DDRS HCBS Waivers Section 9: BDDS Quality Assurance Services 70 Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 - Bruises or contusions larger than three inches or lacerations requiring more than basic first aid - Any puncture wound penetrating the skin - Any pica ingestion requiring more than first aid A fall resulting in injury, regardless of severity of the injury A medication error, except for refusal to take medications, including the following: - Medication given that was not prescribed or ordered for the individual, or wrong medication - Failure to admin ister medication as prescribed, including an incorrect dosage, missed medication, wrong route, and failure to give medication at the appropriate time - Medication error tha t jeopardizes an individual's health and welfare and requires medical attention Use of any aversive technique , including but not limited to: - Seclusion - Painful or noxious stimuli - Denial of a health -related necessity - Other aversive technique identified by the DDRS policy Use of any PRN (as needed/when necessary) medication related to an individual's behavior Use of any physical or mechanical restraint , regardless of whether it was planned, was approved by a human rights committee (HRC) or there was informed consent View t he full Policy on Incident Reporting and Management at in.gov/fssa /ddrs . Additional information about incident reporting is available on the BDDS Incident Reporting at in.gov/fssa /ddrs . Section 9. 3: Complaints Any individual, guardian, family member, service provider or community member has the right to file a complaint on the behalf of an individual receiving supports or services through the FSW o r CIH Waiver: The BDDS quality vendor is responsible for operating the BDDS Complaint System for individuals receiving Supportive Living Services from the FSW or CIH Waiver . By definition, complaints are broad in type and scope and can be specific to either one individual, a group of individuals or a provider. The DDRS does not intend for complaints to replace any of the waivers' primary systems established to routinely monito r and assure individuals' health and welfare, specifically the state's case management and incident reporting systems. Instead, the complaint system is meant to provide individuals, their families/guardians, providers and community members an additional ve nue for identifying and addressing issues when day -to-day monitoring activities have been, or appear to be, ineffective in assuring an individual's health and safety. To give the system an opportunity to work, the BDDS encourages complainants with individu al- specific issues, who have not already done so, to approach their case manager s to try and resolve the issue first. If this has not produced the desired outcome, the complainant can contact the BDDS again to file a complaint. When requested, complainants can choose to be anonymous. The BDDS quality vendor reviews and categorizes all initial complaints as urgent or critical and assigns a complaint investigator to investigate the case within specified time parameters. Certain circumstances may require the BDDS to contact APS, DCS , local law enforcement and/or the provider to take immediate measures to assure the individual's health and welfare . It should be noted that the BDDS quality vendor conducts most activities related to complaint investigations on an unannounced basis. Some activities, such as interviews with individuals who may have information regarding the issue but are not directly employed by the entity the complaint Section 9: BDDS Quality Assurance Services DDRS HCBS Waivers Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 71 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 is against, sometimes require advanced scheduling to ensure those individuals ar e available. Depending on the nature of the complaint, investigation activities may include : - Conducting site visits to the individual's home and/or day program site - Conducting one -on-one interviews with the individual receiving services and/or their staff, guardians, family members, and any other people involved in the issue being investigated - Requesting and reviewing of documents/information from involved providers When complaint allegations are found to be in violation of IAC, the BDDS quality vendor sends the provider a corrective action plan (CAP) to remedy the situation . In rare cases in which the issue was already discovered and corrected by the provider prior t o any investigation by the quality vendor , a CAP may not be required. In these cases, the quality vendor would verify the implementation of the corrective action the provider implemented to ensure that the issue is appropriately resolved. To obtain specifi c information related to the investigation process, providers may refer to the Policy on BQIS Complaints Supported Living Services & Supports at in.gov/fssa. Currently, complaints can b e filed using the online complaint form or through the BDDS toll-free telephone number at 800-545-7763 . Section 9. 4: Mortality Reviews The BDDS is responsible for conducting mortality reviews for all deaths of individuals that received the BDDS services, regardless of service setting. Providers are required to report all deaths through the Incident Reporting System accessible from the BDDS Incident Reporting page : The BDDS quality vendor is responsible for conducting the mortality review process, which begins when the BDDS Mortality Review Triage Team (MRTT) r equests and reviews medical history and other related documentation for all deceased individuals. Reviews involve discussion of events prior to the death, supports/services in place at the time of death, documentation received, whether additional documenta tion is needed for review, and whether the death should be presented to the Mortality Review Committee (MRC) as a focus case for further review and discussion. Any death can be brought before the MRC for discussion at the request of the members, the BDDS Quality Assurance director or other BDDS staff that has a concern. The MRC is facilitated by the BDDS quality vendor . Committee members include representatives from APS, the Indiana Department of Health (ID OH), Indiana Disability Rights, the Office of Medic aid Policy and Planning (OMPP) , the statewide waiver ombudsman, BDDS field service staff and community advocates. Based on their discussion, the MRC makes recommendations for systemic improvements , such as developing new DDRS policy, revising policy, training, or the development and sharing of critical service area fact sheets and posting to the BDDS Quality Assurance page . The MRC also makes provider -specific recommendations that are included in th e closure letter from the MRC. The MRTT and/or the MRC can refer a case to BDDS for a mortality investigation to review key areas of a provider's system that appear to have not been in place or to have been ineffective at the time of an individual's death. Providers may be required to develop CAPs to address identified issues and to prevent other individuals from experiencing negative outcomes. See the Policy on Mortality Review at in.gov/fssa for further information regarding mortality reviews and the MRC . Section 9. 5: National Core Indicator (NCI) Project The DDRS participat es in the National Core Indicator (NCI) Project. This national research project, administered through the Human Services Research Institute and the National Association of State Developmental Disabilities Directors (NASDDDS) , was developed to obtain a standardized set of DDRS HCBS Waivers Section 9: BDDS Quality Assurance Services 72 Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 consumer outcome measures for community -based services. NCI Project information is designed to b e captured through face -to-face consumer satisfaction interviews. The BDDS quality vendor conduct s these interviews across the state with individuals selected based on representative random samples from each DDRS waiver. Participation in this project allows the DDRS to make comparisons with other states providing waiver services across the count ry. Section 9. 6: Case Record Reviews The BDDS Quality Assurance services and authorized vendors are responsible for conducting case record reviews (CRR s) on files for individuals who receive HCBS waiver services to ascertain case manager compliance with 460 IAC 7 and the FS W and CIH Waiver . Based on the requirement that the service plan is centered around the individual 's needs and preferences using person -centered services that support them and their families in living their defined best life , Case record reviews include: Review of the person -centered individualized support plan (PCISP ) to ensure it reflects what is important to and for the individual in each completed Life Domain Risk assessment (embedded in PCISP ) is demonstrated by information included in the appropriate Life Domain Identified risk plans are attached to PCISP and have been reviewed/updated during the service plan year Nonwaiver services or choice to not receive intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities (ICF/IID) Medicaid ser vices is documen ted on the BDDS Signature Page/Freedom of Choice Section Signed pick lists (provider choice lists) for each service is documented An updated PCISP was completed when an individual's conditions or circumstances change d Reviews are conducted on a monthly basis u sing a waiver -specific valid random sampling methodology. Section 9.7: Quality On -Site Provider Review To evaluate services, BDDS has created the Quality On -Site Provider Review, or QOPR. This process includes an on -site rev iew and evaluation of the quality of services being delivered to individuals receiving waivers. While BDDS will continue to review compliance with Medicaid rules ( such as , qualified provider, employee background checks and training), the state will also ta lk directly to individuals to make sure they are receiving person -centered quality services. Detailed information related to the QOPR , including an overview video, individual and organizational indicators, and information sheets can be found on the BDDS Quality Assurance page at in.gov/fssa /ddrs . For ease of reference , the Provider Information Sheet contains the following: What is the Quality On -Site Provider Review? The Bureau of Developmental Disabilities Services is using the Quality On -Site Provider Review to ensure the quality of the home and community -based (waiver) services individuals receive. These person -centered services should empower the individual to live, love, learn, work, play and pursue their dreams. What is the Quality On -Site Provider Tool? The tool is organized around the Charting the LifeCourse domains and includes indicators which will support BDDS in determining if individual outcomes are being achieved as well as provider compliance with the HCBS S ettings Rule . The Quality On -Site Provider Review has two sets of indicators. One set is used to assess a provider's systems to support people to have their best life. The Section 9: BDDS Quality Assurance Services DDRS HCBS Waivers Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 73 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 second set of indicators is used in conversations with individuals supported by the provider. Each indicator is given a rating: disagree, met, strongly agree, not observed. What can we expect of the process? To assess service delivery, the Quality On -Site Provider Review process will include a two -day, on - site review conducted by a quali ty reviewer. They will have conversations with individuals, support staff, supervisors and management. They'll also review key documents to ensure provider standards are being met. How will I know the result of the Quality On -Site Provider Review? The rev iew will include a wrap -up meeting to discuss the results and an opportunity for the provider to request technical assistance and training regarding any of the review. BDDS want s to ensure that you have the tools you need to be successful. A final report w ill summarize the review. What if I have questions about the Quality On -Site Provider Review? You are welcome to contact BDDS : BDDS.Help@fssa.in.gov 800-545-7763 Section 9. 8: Statewide Waiver Ombudsman The role of the statewide waiver ombudsman is to receive, investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and concerns that are made by or on behalf of individuals who have an intellectual/developmental disability and who receive HCBS waiver servic es. Complaints may be submitted to the statewide waiver ombudsman via the toll -free number 800 -622- 4484 and option 2 or via email at BDDSWaiver.Ombudsman@fssa.in.gov . Types of complaints received inc lude complaints initiated by families and/or individuals involving rights or issues of individual choice, and complaints requiring coordination between legal services, administrating agency services and provider services. The ombudsman is expected to initiate contact with the complainant as soon as possible a fter the complaint is received. However, precise timelines for the final resolution of each complaint are not established. Although it is expected that the ombudsman will diligently and persistentl y pursue the resolution of each complaint determined to req uire investigation, it is recognized that circumstances surrounding each investigation vary. Time frames for complaint resolution vary in accordance with the required research, in the collection of evidence, and in the numbers and availability of persons w ho must be contacted, interviewed or brought together to resolve the complaint. Although the statewide waiver ombudsman is considered \"independent\" by statute, t he DDRS director is responsible for oversight of the ombudsman. With the consent of the waiver individual , the ombudsman must be provided access to the individual records, including records held by the entity providing services to the individual . When it has been determined the individual is not capable of giving consent, the statewide waiver ombudsman must be provided access to the name, address and telephone number of the individual 's legal representative. A provider of waiver services or any employee of a provider of waiver services is imm une from civil or criminal liability and from actions taken under a professional disciplinary procedure for the release or disclosure of records to the statewide waiver ombudsman. A state or local government agency or entity that has records relevant to a complaint or an investigation conducted by the ombudsman must also provide the ombudsman with access to the records . The statewide waiver ombudsman coordinates their activities among the programs that provide legal services for individuals with an intellectual/developmental disability, the DDRS HCBS Waivers Section 9: BDDS Quality Assurance Services 74 Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 administrative agency, providers of waiver services and provider s of other necessary or appropriate services , and ensures that the identity of the indiv idual will not be disclosed without either the individual 's written consent or a court order. At the conclusion of an investigation of a complaint, the ombudsman repo rts the ombudsman's findings to the complainant. If the ombudsman does not investigate a c omplaint, the ombudsman notifies the complainant of the decision not to investigate and the reasons for the decision. The statewide waiver ombudsman prepares a report at least annually (or upon request), describing the operations of the program. A copy of the report is provided to the governor, the legislative council and the director of the DDRS . Trends are identified so that recommendations for needed changes in the service delivery system can be implemented. The administrative agency is required to maintain a statewide toll -free telephone line continuously open to receive complaints regarding waiver individuals with intellectual/developmental disabilities. All complaints received from the toll -free line must be forwarded to the statewide waiver ombudsman, who will advise the individual that the complaint process is not a prerequisite or a substitute for a Medic aid fair hearing when the problem falls under the scope of the Medicaid fair hearing process. A person who does any of t he following commits a Class B misdemeanor : - Intentionally prevents the work of the ombudsman - Knowingly offers compensation to the ombudsman in an effort to affect the outcome of an investigati on or a potential investigation - Knowingly or intentionally retal iates against an individual , a client, an employee or another person who files a complaint or provides information to the ombudsman Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 75 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 Section 10: Service Definitions and Requirements Section 10.1: Service Definition Overview This section defines the services currently approved for the Home - and Community -Based Services (HCBS) waiver programs operated by the Division of Disability and Rehabilitati ve Services (DDRS).

Section 10. 8: Remote Supports Service Definition Remote supports includes a wide range of technology -based services that allows for trained remote support professionals (RSPs) to deliver live support to an individual from a remote location in place of on -site staffing. Remote supports are delivered by awake, alert remote support professionals whose primary duties are to provide remote supports from the provider's secure remote supports facility. To ensure safety and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA ) compliance, this facility should have appropriate, stable and redundant connections. This should include, but is not limited to, backup generators, multiple internet service connections, battery backups and so on . Remote supports include the provision of oversight and monitoring within the residential setting of adult waiver participants and individuals 14 to 17 years of age through the use of technology, two -way communication systems and sensors. For minors, remote supports are used to foster developmentally appropriate independence and not to replace typical parental supervision. Remote support services foster independence and security by combining technology and service to allow for direct contact with trained st aff when the individual needs. Remote supports provide a realistic, non - invasive way for individuals to build life skills and familiarity in their level of independence with a sense of security. Remote supports can assist individuals to live more independe ntly or support a safe transition to independent living while enhancing their self -advocacy skills and increase opportunities for participating in the community. Remote supports may be used with either paid or unpaid backup support as specified in the indi vidual's service plan. Backup support is when a trained person is responsible for responding in -person/on -site in the event of an emergency or when an individual receiving remote supports otherwise needs assistance or the equipment used for delivery of rem ote supports stops working for any reason. Paid backup support is provided on a paid basis by a provider of Residential Habilitation and Support (CIH Waiver) or Participant Assistance and Care (Family Supports Waiver , or FSW) that is both the primary poin t of contact for the remote support s vendor and the entity to send paid staff person(s) on -site when needed. Unpaid backup support may be provided by a family member, friend or other person who the individual chooses. The person -centered individualized su pport plan (PCISP ) will reflect how the remote supports are being used to meet the individual's needs, vision for their good life, and health and welfare needs. Additional Information : Remote supports are available under the FS W and CIH Waiver.

Initial and ongoing training, education and technical assistance of paid and unpaid backup support intervention to prepare for prompt enga gement with the individual(s) and/or immediate deployment to the residential setting . Updates of remote support equipment and technology when the equipment and technology require regular information technology supports. Installation of remote supports equi pment and technology is allowable in the residential or family home settings or unpaid back up support person location when necessary to provide remote support services in place of on -site staffing. When all service standards are met, the service provider shall be reimbursed at the full unit rate for each hour that the remote supports service is rendered. The unit rate for each hour of remote supports service utilization shall be divided by and among the number of waiver individuals present in the home du ring any portion of the hour for which reimbursement is requested. Dividing the unit rate by and among waiver individuals applies only to individuals for whom remote supports are included on the plan. Service Standards The remote supports system must be designed and implemented to ensure the individual's independence, health and safety in their own home/apartment Note: The case manager and/or the BDDS service coordinator will review the use of the system at seven calendar days, and again a t 14 calendar days post -installation. Assessment and Informed Consent The following are key points regarding assessment and informed consent: Informed consent: Informed consent by the individual using the service, their guardian and other individuals and their guardians residing in the home must be obtained and clearly state the parameters in which the remote support service would be used. Each individual, guardian and IST must be made aware of both the benefits and risks of the operating parameters and limitations. Through an assessment by the remote support provider with input from the individual and their IST the location of the devices or mo nitors will be determined to best meet the individual's needs. The PCISP will reflect the individual's control and use of the equipment. The individual must be informed by the remote support provider on the operation and use of the equipment. Informed co nsent documents must be acknowledged in writing, signed and dated by the individual, guardian, case manager and provider agency representative, as appropriate. A copy of the consent shall be maintained by the local DDRS/BDDS office, the guardian (if applic able) and in the home file.

The remote supports system must receive notification of smoke/heat alarm activation at each individual 's residential living site. The remote supports system mus t have two -way (at minimum, full duplex) audio co mmunication capabilities to allow monitoring base staff to effectively interact with and address the needs of individuals in each living site, including emergency situations when the individual may not be able to use the telephone. The remote supports system must allow the monitoring base staff to have visual (video) oversight of areas in individual 's residential living sites as deemed necessary by the IST. A remote supports monitoring base may not be located in an individual 's residential living site. A secure (compliant with the HIPAA) network system requiring authentication, authorization and encryption of data must be in place to ensure access to computer vision, audio, sensor or written information is limited to authorized staff including the parent/gua rdian, provider agency, FSSA, the DDRS, the BDDS, the QIDP, case manager and individual . The equipment must include a visual indicator to the individual that the system is on and operating. For s ituations involving remote supports of individuals needing 24 -hour support , if an individual indicates that they want the remote supports system to be turned off and wants in-person supports , the following protocol will be implemented: - The electronic caregiver will notify the provider to reques t an on -site staff or other previously identified paid or unpaid backup support responder. - The system would be left operating until the on -site staff or other previously identified paid or unpaid backup support responder arrives. DDRS HCBS Waivers Section 10: Service Definitions and Requirements Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 91 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 - The electronic caregiver w ould turn off the system at that site after it has been relieved by an on- site staff or other previously identified paid or unpaid backup support responder. - A visible light on the control box would signal when the system is on and when it is off. Remote Support Monitoring Base Staff The following are requirements for remote supports monitoring base staff when remote supports are used in place of in -person direct support service delivery : At the time of monitoring, the remote supports monitoring base staff may not have duties other than the oversight and support of individuals at remote living sites. The remote supports monitoring base staff will assess any urgent situation at an individual 's home and call 911 emergency personnel first , if it is deemed necessary, and then call the backup staff person. The remote supports monitoring base staff will stay engaged with the individuals at the home during an urgent situation until the backup staff or emergency personnel arrive. If computer vision or video is used, oversight of an individual 's home must be done in real time by an awake staff at a remote location ( remote monitoring base) using telecommunications/broadband, the equivalent or better, c onnection. The remote supports monitoring base (remote station) shall maintain a file on each individual in each home monitored that includes a current photograph of each individual , which must be updated if significant physical changes occur, and at least annually.

Examples include : Fire, medical crises, stranger in the home, violence betwee n individuals and any other situation that appears to threaten the health or welfare of the individual . Emergency response drills must be carried out once per quarter per shift in each home equipped with and capable of utilizing the remote supports monitor ing service. Documentation of the drills must be available for review upon request. When used to replace in -person direct support service delivery, t he remote monitoring base staff shall generate a written report on each individual served in each individua l's residential living site on a daily basis. This report will follow documentation standards of the RHS or PAC service . This report must be transmitted to the primary RHS or PAC provider daily.

Limitations and Reimbursement Parameters Remote supports can be provided one -on-one or as a group service. Remote supports provides a realistic, non -invasive way for many individuals and families to find the supports they need to build life skills and familiarity in their level of independence with a sense of security. Individuals and families who are utilizing the Family Supports Waiver (FSW) may want to try the service to see if it works for them. With this in mind, the first $500 of remote supports added to their annual service plan year will be outside of the $1 9,614 budget cap . The budget will be completed for each individual based upon the total number of individuals residing within the residence. However , lower tiers may also appear on the service plans to reflect reimbursement rates for situations where one or more individual is away from the home during service utilization. Reimbursement will then be the hourly rate of $13.62 divided by and among the nu mber of individuals who are at home during the hours of utilization (see Table 4) . If only one individual from a four -individual setting is at home during service utilization, the solitary individual pays the full hourly rate of $13.62. If only two of the four individuals are home, each pays $6.81 per hour of utilization, and if three of the four are home, each pays $4.54 per hour of utilization .

The system is connected to the person's phone and programmed to signal a response center after a \"help\" button is activated. The response center is staffed by trained professionals . Additional Information: The purpose of equipment or a device under PERS is to enable the individual to secure help in an emergency. If a device doesn't have the ability to ini tiate a call for help, it doesn't fit this service definition. PERS is limited to those individuals who live alone, or who are alone for significant parts of the day, and have no regular caregiver for extended periods of time, and who would otherwise re quire extensive supervision. If the intent and purpose of equipment or a device is to either locate an individual who is lost or to enable the individual to periodically \"check in ,\" such as to report making it home safely from an outing, then remote sup ports would be the appropriate service. A human rights committee may need to determine the appropriateness of a device if it is to be worn by the individual as a tracking device.

The nationally recognized Inventory for Client and Agency Planning (ICAP ) was selected to be the primary tool for individual assessment. The ICAP assessment determines an individual 's level of functioning for broad independence and general maladaptive factors. The ICAP addendum, commonly refer red to as the behavior and health factors, determines an individual 's level of functioning on behav ior and health factors. These two assessments determine an individual 's overall Algo score, which can range from 0 -6. Individuals with Algo scores between 0 and 6 are considered outliers representing those who are the lowest and the highest on both ends o f the functioning spectrum. On review, the state may manually adjust the designation of an individual from an Algo score of 5 to an Algo score of 6. Although this individual continues receiving the Algo 5 budget, their Algo score of 6 indicates a need for additional ove rsight of the individual . The stakeholder group designed a grid to build the allocations. The grid was developed with the following tenets playing key roles: Focus on daytime programming Employment Community integration Housemates The objective -based allocation (OBA ) is then determined by combining the overall Algo score (determined by the ICAP and ICAP addendum), age, employment and living arrangement. Note: Individuals designated as Algo 3, 4 or 5 and meeting criteria for RHS Daily se rvices may choose to u se RHS Daily .

When transitions occur on other days of the month, the two providers of case management services must determine which contracting provider entity will bill and whether one entity owes the othe r a portion of the monthly fee. Providers will handle any such transactions and/or arrangements amongst themselves, with both (or all involved ) contracting provider entitie s being held responsible for document ing these transactions in regard to future financial audits.

Wellness coordination services extend beyond those services provided through routine doctor/healthcare visits required under the Medicaid State Plan and are specifically designed for individuals requiring the assistance of an RN or LPN to properly coordinate their medical needs. The following levels of support have these requirements: Tier I: Healthcare needs require a face -to-face visit once a month with an RN or LPN and consultations/reviews based on the individual's current healthcare needs. Tier II: Healthcare needs require a face -to-face visit twice a month with an RN or LPN and consultations/reviews based on the individual's current healthcare needs. Tier III : Healthcare needs require a face -to-face visit once a week with an RN or LPN and consultations/reviews based on the individual's current healthcare needs. Conditions and Requirements Necessity for wellness coordination services will typically be reserved for individuals assessed with health scores of 5 or higher through the state's objective -based allocation process. Individuals assessed with health scores of 0 -4 would not require assistance of an RN or LPN t o coordinate medical needs. As medical events occur and/or an individual 's medical needs change, the IST is expected to obtain reassessment for potential revision to the health score and to ensure utilization of the appropriate tier of services. Service S tandards Reimbursement is available for wellness coordination services only when the following circumstances are present: The individual requires assistance in coordinating medical needs beyond what can be provided through routine doctor/health care visits .

Individuals must be employed in a community -based, competitive job that pays at or above minimum wage to access this service. The initial job placement, training and stabilization ma y be provided through Indiana Vocational Rehabilitation Services. Extended services provide the additional work -related supports needed by the individual to continue to be as independent as possible in community employment. If an employed individual has obtained community -based competitive employment and stabilization without Vocational Rehabilitation Services, the individual is still eligible to receive Extended Services, as long as the individual meets the qualifications (see the Provider Qualifications section) . Ongoing employment support services are identified in the individuals ' PCISP and must be related to the individuals ' limitations in functional areas ( for example, self-care, understanding and use of language, learning, mobility, self -direction, capacity for independent living, economic self - sufficiency), as necessary to maintain employment. Documentation is maintained in the file of each individual receiving this service that the service is not available under a program funded under section 110 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 or the IDEA (20 USC 1401 et seq. ). Federal financial participation is not claimed for incentive payments, subsidies or unrelated vocational training expenses such as the following: DDRS HCBS Waivers Section 10: Service Definitions and Requirements Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 155 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 Incentive payments made to an employer to encourage or subsidize the employer's participation in supported employment; or Payments that are passed through to users of sup ported employment services. Additional Information Individuals may also use workplace assistance during any hours of competitive integrated employment in conjunction with their use of extended services . Extended services are not time -limited. Community settings are defined as nonresidential, integrated settings that are in t he community. Services m ay not be rendered within the same building(s) alongside other nonintegrated individuals . Competitive integrated employment is defined as full or part -time work at minimum wage or higher, with wages and benefits similar to those without disabilities performing the same work, and fully integrated with coworkers without disabilities. Individuals may be self -employed, working from their own homes, and still receive extended services when the work is competitive and could also be performed in an integrate d environment by and among persons without intellectual/developmental disabilities. Extended services are available under the FSW and CIH Waiver . Reimbursable Activities Reimbursable activities include the following: Ensuring that natural supports at the worksite are secured through interaction with supervisors and staff (A tangible outcome of this activity would be a decrease in the number of hours of extended services an individual accessed over time. ) Training for the individual and/or the individual 's employer, supervisor or coworkers, to increase the individual 's inclusion at the worksite Regular observation or sup port of the individual to reinforce and stabilize the job placement Job-specific or jo b-related safety training Job-specific or job -related self -advocacy skills training Reinforcement of work -related personal care and social skills Training on use of public transportation and/or acquisition of appropriate transportation Facilitating, but not funding, driver's education training Coaching and training on job -related tasks , such as computer skills or other job -specific tasks Travel by the provider to the work site as part of the delivery of this service Individual (one -on-one) services can be billed in 15-minute increments. For extended services provided in a group setting, reimbursement equals the unit rate divided by the number of individuals served. With the exception of 1:1 on -the-job coaching, support and observation, the potential exists for all components of the extended services service definition to be applicable to either a waiver individual or to a group of individuals . However, specific examples of activities that might be r endered in a group setting would include instructing a group of individuals on professional appear ance requirements for various types DDRS HCBS Waivers Section 10: Service Definitions and Requirements 156 Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 of employment, reinforcement of work -related personal care or social skills, knowing how to get up in time to get ready fo r and commute to work. Groups could receive job -specific or job -related safety training, self - advo cacy training, or training on the use of public transportation. A group could receive training on computer skills or other job -specific tasks when group indiv iduals have similar training needs. Service Standards Extended Services are provided in integrated community settings where persons without disabilities are also employed. Reimbursement will only be made for the employment support services required by the individual receiving services as a result of their disability. Extended Services do not include sheltered work or other similar types of vocational services furnished in specialized facilities or volunteer endeavors . An individuals' PCISP should be constr ucted in a manner that reflects individual informed choice and goals relating to employment and ensures provision of services in the most integrated setting possible. The Extended Services supports should be designed to support employment outcomes that lea d to further independence and are consistent with the individual's goals. Documentation Standards Individual informed choices and goals related to employment and the justification/need for Extended Services must be outlined in the PCISP . In addition to c ompliance with documentation requirements outlined in 460 IAC 6 , the following data elements are required for each service rendered: Name of individual served IHCP Member ID of the individual Name of provider Identified employment need Service rendered Expected outcome Date of service including the year Time frame of service (include a.m. or p.m.) Notation of the primary location of service delivery A summary of services rendered to include the specific reimbursable activities that were performed and the outcomes realized from those activities A description of any issue or circumstance concerning the individual including, but not limited to, significant medical or behavioral incidents or any other situation that may be uncommon for the individual Signature that includes at least the last name and first initial of the staff person making the entry (Electronic signatures are permissible when in compliance with the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act [IC 26 -2-8]) Upon request, all data elements must be made available to auditors, quality monitors, case manager s and any other government en tity.

These supports include adaptive skill development, assistance with activities of daily living, community inclusion, transportation, adult educational supports, and social and leisure skill development that support the individual to live successfully in their own home. A relative of the individual may be a provider of Residential Habilitation and Support (RHS) services. The decision that a relative is the best choice of persons to provide these services is a part of the person - centered planning process and is documented i n the PCISP. When the provider is a relative, there is an annual review by the IST to determine whether the individual 's relative should continue to be the provider of RHS services. Additional Information: Available only under the CIH Waiver. Individuals Eligible for RHS Daily Services Individuals who choose RHS and meet all the following criteria are eligible for and may choose to use RHS daily services: Individuals who have an Algo score of 3, 4 or 5 on their objective -based allocation (OBA) Individuals who are living with ho usemates and are u sing a shared staffing model Individuals who are living outside their family home DDRS HCBS Waivers Section 10: Service Definitions and Req uirements Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 159 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 Algo Score Descriptors Table 1 presents the Algo level descriptors as found in Indiana Administrative Code 460 IAC 13 . Refer to Table 3 - Medicaid Waiver Services, Codes and Rates for FSW and CIH Waiver under Section 10.2: Medicaid Waiver Services, Codes and Rates for applicable billing information. The nationally recognized Invento ry for Client and Agency Planning (ICAP ) was selected to be the primary tool for individual assessmen t. The ICAP assessment determines a n individual's level of functioning for broad independence and general maladaptive factors. The ICAP addendum, commonly referred to as the behavior and health factors, determines a n individual's level of functioning on be havior and health factors. These two assessments determine a n individual's overall Algo level, which can range from 0 -6. Algos 0 and 6 are considered outliers r epresenting those who are the lowest and the highest on both ends of the functioning spectrum. On review, the state may manually adjust the budget of a n individual from an Algo 5 to an Algo 6. Although this individual continues receiving the Algo 5 budget, the Algo 6 indicates a need for additional oversight of the individual . The stakeholder group designed a grid to build the allocations. The grid was developed with the following tenets playing key roles: Focus on da ytime programming Employment Community integration Housemates The OBA is then determined by combining the overall Algo (determined by the ICAP and ICAP addendum), age, employment and living arrangement. See Section 6: Objective -Based Allocation in this module for further details. Reimbursable Activities Reimbursable activities include the following: Assistance with acquiring, enhancing and building natural supports - For example, a measurable outcome would be increased hours of natural supports and a decrease in the number of hours needed for paid staff.

Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 171 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 Section 11: RFA Policies The following policies address use of the required Request for Approval to Authorize Services (RFA) fo rm for authorization of the environmental modification, specialized medical equipment and supplies, and vehicle modification services. Section 11.1: Environmental Modification Policy Waiver Policy Notification Authority: Code of Federal Regulations 42 CFR 441.302 Policy Topic: Environmental Modification Policy Clarification Impacts the following Home - and Community -Based Services (HCBS) waivers: Community Integration and Habilitation (CIH) Waiver Family Supports Waiver (FSW) Effective July 16, 2020, environmental modifications are now a covered service under both the Community Integration and Habilitation (CIH) and the Family Supports Waiver (FSW) Effective Date: Dec. 1, 2007 , and replaces all previous policies related to the authorization of Environmental Modifications. Description Environmental modifications are minor physical adaptations to the home , as required by the individual's service authorization , which are necessary to ensure the health, welfare and safety of the in dividual . These environmental modifications enable the individual to function with greater independence in the home and without which the individual would require institutionalization. A lifetime cap of $15,000 is available for environmental modifications per waiver . The cap represents a cost for basic modification of an individual's home for accessibility and safety and accommodates t he individual's needs for housing modifications. The cost of an environmental modification includes all materials, equipmen t, labor and permits to complete the project. No parts of an environmental modification may be billed separately as part of any othe r service category ( for example, specialized medical equipment and supplies ). In addition to the $ 15,000 lifetime cap, $500 is allowable annually for the repair, replacement, or an adjustment to an existing environmental modification that was funded by a n HCBS waiver. For the FSW , environmental modifications are outside $19,614 cap. DDRS HCBS Waivers Section Library Reference Number: PRPR10014 Published: June 29, 2023 Policies and procedures as of June 1, 2023 Version: 10.0 Additional Information : As a reminder, HCBS waiver funding covers only basic modifications determined to be medically necessary for the waiver individual and is not available for items that exceed basic medical need. Requests to upgrade products or to use materials exceeding the individual's basic need will not be approved. For example, if a bathroom modification is necessary but the individual or family requests tiled flooring when basic vinyl flooring could be installed, the individual or family must decide whether to access wai ver funds for completion of the basic modification or to assume financial responsibility for the entire modification inclusive of desired upgrade(s). Due to the state's responsibility to ensure each modification is the most cost effective or conservative means to meet the individual's need(s) for accessibility within the home, i t is not acceptable to submit bids attempting to combine waiver funding for basic modifications with private funding to cover the higher costs of the desired upgrade(s). Home Owner ship Environmental modifications shall be approved for the individual's own home or family -owned home. Rented homes or apartments are allowed to be modified only when a signed agreement from the landlord is obtained. The signed agreement must be submitted along with all other required waiver documentation. Choice of Provider The individual chooses which approved/certified providers will submit bids or estimates for this service. The provider with the lowest bid will be chosen, unless there is a strong written justification from the case manager detailing why a provider with a high er bid sho uld be selected.

Environmental modification requests must be provided in accordance with applicable state and/or local building codes and should be guided by the Americans with Disability Act (ADA ) or ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG ) requirements when in the best interest of the individual and the individual's specific situation. Environmental modifications shall be authorized only when it is determined to be medically necessary and shall have direct medical or remedial benefit for the waiver individual. This determination includes the following considerations: The modification is the most cost effective or conservative means to meet the individual' s need(s) for accessibility within the home .

Three home modification bids must be obtained for all modifications over $1,000 .
