Section members had over $10 million in research funding in 2018. t The Section serves as the clinical home for the NIH funded Digestive Disease Center, one of 17 federally funded centers focusing on research in GI diseases. Our top-notch faculty received many accolades at the local and national levels. We represent BCM in all major professional societies; our faculty holds several leadership positions within the American Gastroenterological Association, American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, American Society of Gastroenterological Association, and the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation. The Section also serves as the home for the journal Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology, one of the major clinical journals in the field. We continue to provide high quality, compassionate healthcare at Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center (BSLMC), Ben Taub General Hospital, and Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center. BSLMC ranked nationally for gastroenterology service this year. In 2018, we introduced several innovations in our practices, including cutting edge advanced endoscopic procedures, multidisciplinary treatment of complex GI disorders, and population-based management programs. Our faculty continues to play an important role in advancing our understanding of digestive and liver diseases and training future clinicians and researchers. This annual report outlines some of the achievements and recognition received during 2018.

David Hyman, MD, MPH, Professor of Medicine Chief, Section of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine Baylor College of Medicine Section of General Internal Medicine 49Baylor Clinic - Primary Care Outpatient Faculty Group Practice The General Internal Medicine Faculty Group Practice (FGP) moved to McNair Clinic in January 2018. After being at the Baylor Clinic location for over 10 years, the Department of Medicine relocated most of the Medicine sections to the new, long awaited McNair Campus on January 16, 2018. It is located across the street from the MEDVAMC. The new address for General Internal Medicine, outpatient clinic is 7200 Cambridge, 8th Floor, Houston, TX, 77030. The GIM FGP includes a dedicated group of 8 clinicians who practice not only general internal medicine providing evidence-based, high quality care for the prevention and treatment of chronic medi - cal conditions but also specialize in a variety of areas including women's health, diabetes and adolescent care. In addition, several FGP members work on quality improve - ment projects and health services research. PATIENT GROWTH AND PREVENTIVE CARE QUALITY IN FY2018 The Baylor Clinic General Internal Medicine Faculty Group Practice has provided care to approximately 7975 patients, with an increase of 1,048 new patients over the past year. GIM continues to provide high Preventive Care Quality Scores in Blood Pressure Control, Diabetes Control and Tobacco Screening Cessation.Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center Hospitalist Group The concept for the Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center (BSLMC) Hospitalist group was originally proposed in the fall of 2015. Background work, which was done to initi - ate the Baylor hospitalist group at BSLMC hospital, included contractual relationships with the hospital and with the existing hospitalist groups. The driving force for the Baylor group to initiate a hospitalist program at BSLMC was the hospital's desire to achieve improvement in quality metrics (reduction of length of stay, readmissions, mortality, complications and improvement in HCAPS and other quality measures.) In June 2016, BCM went into an official contract with BSLMC to provide a hospital - ist service that will cover all non-ICU and non-managed care patients. In October 2016, BCM hospitalist group sub-contracted with two existing hospitalist groups so they can work under the BCM umbrella to deliver hospitalist services and desirable results for BSLMC hospital. Improvement in metrics were visible within a few months after the program started. Hospitalist services were expanded to maximize efficiency, throughput and patient safety. At the request of BSLMC hospital, the hospital - ist program has made several changes from an admitting/rounding model to a model where the same attending who will follow patients daily will do admissions.The BSLMC hospitalist group has created schedule and throughput processes to make sure patients are taken care of by the appropriate attendings and consult services. The group has strived hard to build relationships with Baylor and private attendings alike. In June 2018, the BSLMC Hospitalist team started the resident hospitalist team also known as RITE team at Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center. The BSLMC hospitalists are actively involved in hospital committees and the utilization manage - ment committee is chaired by one of the BSLMC hospitalists, Dr. Jarrouge. In addition to hospital committees, various hospitalists are involved in scholarly activity and quality improvement projects at BSLMC. Harris Health System Harris Health System (HHS) is the largest public health care system in Houston and Harris County with a focus on serving a primarily low resource/underserved patient population. The Section of General Internal Medicine (SGIM) faculty at Ben Taub and Smith Clinic saw a combined total of 94,699 patients visits in FY18 and generated a total of 123,700 WRVUs. This is a combination of all inpatient- teaching and hospitalist as well as outpatient services at Smith Clinic. The Harris Health SGIM group was over 100% of expected productivity for the 2018 academic year. Section members at HHS serve as leaders on numerous HHS committees including patient safety, health information management, pharmacy and therapeutics and ethics. All done with innovation and compassion to advance health and wellness. Section of General Internal MedicineBen Taub Hospital HOT (HOSPITALIST ONLY TEAM) INPATIENT CARE The HOT service is comprised of general internists specializing in inpatient hospital management without trainees. We provide high quality care to complex medical patients at Ben Taub General Hospital with five rounding teams, one admitting team and a night service. In the 2018 academic year our HOT service has provided care for approximately 35,000 patients. As members of Baylor and Harris Health, the HOT faculty precept students as part of a commitment to medical education and frequently attend on teaching wards. We hold monthly meetings focusing on patient outcomes, care management, and are in the process of joining our hospitalist partners at St. Luke's and the VA in forming a quarterly journal club. Faculty on the HOT service actively serve on hospital committees to provide crucial input in policy development. Our members work closely with nursing and hospital leader - ship to improve medical delivery to the bedside. We additionally meet monthly with Emergency Department leadership to streamline the transition from our triage department to the wards. INPATIENT TEACHING SERVICE Baylor College of Medicine faculty pro - vides supervision of inpatient medical care for hundreds of residents and students annually. The inpatient teaching service includes 8 ward teams, a consult service and a special rotation for upper level residents to learn hospital medicine (RITE) team. The inpatient teaching service reg - ularly receives fantastic evaluations from students and residents. For many, the Ben Taub inpatient service is the 'crown jewel' among all the great clinical opportunities in the Baylor system.HHS SMITH (OUTPATIENT) CLINIC Smith Medicine Clinic is a Harris Health System primary care clinic where nine - ty-three internal medicine residents spend their three-year residency taking care of their continuity patients. Smith Medicine Clinic also has medical students rotating through during their ambulatory internal medicine clerkship. The majority of our core clinic faculty work is in both inpatient (Ben Taub General Hospital) and outpatient (Smith Medicine Clinic). In this continuity clinic, house staff learn preventive medicine such as cancer screening and vaccina - tions, in addition to taking care of chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, coronary heart disease, etc. They perform PAP smears and procedures such as arthrocentesis and incision/drain - age of abscesses. Furthermore, they hone their counseling skills in the setting of encouraging patients to stop smoking and modify dietary lifestyle in reducing weight, or advanced life directives, etc. The mean patient volume ranges from 1000 to 1100 visits per month. In this past academic year, our Smith clinic house staff, with GI service assistance, implemented a success - ful Quality Improvement Project in using a PPI tapering set in reducing the number of chronic PPI use. In addition to being actively involved in the residency program's Wednesday school ambulatory curriculum, our clinic faculty led by Drs. Michelle Schmidt, Cara Foldes, and Meroe Morse started an \"Intern Spotlight\" session in which interns are assigned to review recently published articles on ambu - latory care topics. Dr. Schmidt hosts a book club to discuss new books and novels. Dr. Foldes teaches evidence-based medicine in interpreting literature. Dr. Morse is developing an initiative, a comprehensive integrative chronic pain management program to help physicians manage chronic non-cancer pain. Drs. Jaime Rueda and Ordonez often teach our house staff in per - forming procedures such as arthrocentesis. Dr. Lu, the medical director of Smith Clinic, collaborates with Harris Health leaders in increasing specialty resources through E consults and has written the textbook Leading an Academic Medical Practice .Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center (MEDVAMC) INPATIENT - HOSPITALIST SERVICE The MEDVAMC Academic Section of Hospital Medicine began in 2012 with 7 FTE positions and has presently grown to a group of nearly 14 FTE. Our sec - tion of clinician educators focuses on BCM medical resident supervision while attending on the Inpatient Medicine service. We currently cover 50% of the general medicine inpatient teams and are adding an additional team this August. Additionally, we provide coverage on-site nightly to supervise the admitting resident, facilitate rapid response and code blue calls, proactively aid patient flow through the Emergency Department and inde - pendently perform admissions. Our ranks are made of individuals who have taken on increasing leadership roles in education and include 2 Associate Program Directors for the IM Residency Program, the VA based Chief Resident in Quality and Safety (CRQS) Director, the BCM IM Core Clerkship Director and Associate Sub Internship Director, the UT IM Residency Program Site Director and Associate Site Director, the VA BCM Student Site Director as well as numerous PPS3 facilitators and student mentoring community leaders. From an administrative and service perspective, our section participates in numerous high value committees at the VA and recently initiated a Physician Unit Advisor program to liaison with medical nursing unit admin - istration. In June 2018, Dr. Andrew Caruso accepted the Chief role for the Section of Hospital Medicine, and Dr. Cory Ritter is our new Associate Chief. 51Our group recently completed a recruit - ment cycle, and we are excited to welcome three new Hospitalists. Dr. Lindsay Vaclavik joins us after recently completing her year of service to the VA and BCM as one of two Chief Residents in Quality and Service and is also an alumna of the BCM Residency Program from 2017. Dr. Paras Mehta and Dr. Eric Wu just completed their BCM Residency Program training this June and will be joining us this summer. We are additionally recruiting a mid-level provider to be a part of our first endeavor into an inter-professional team. The MEDVAMC Section of Hospital Medicine is looking forward to further expansion and integration with the hos - pitalists at Ben Taub and Baylor St. Luke's Medicine Center and are proud to be a growing part of the Section of General Internal Medicine.PRIMARY CARE - PRIMECARE Primary Care is one of the foundational services at Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center (MEDVAMC). The section has highly dedicated staff who provide excellent pro-active, team based, patient-cen - tered care to our Veterans and take pride in working for the Veterans Health Administration, which is the largest integrated health care system in America. Below are some of the biggest accomplish - ments of this 2018 academic year: When Hurricane Harvey hit Houston in August 2017, MEDVAMC remained open and several of our Primary Care staff went above and beyond to take care of veterans in the most challenging of circumstances in the hospital, GRB Convention Center and in unconven - tional locations such as tents and Mobile Medical Units. Excellent Performance on HEDIS Quality Performance Measures, Access Metrics and ACSC hospitalizations. Lowest Opioid use - While there is an epi - demic of prescription opioid overdoses in the country, MEDVAMC has one of the lowest opioid prescriptions. Primary Care - Mental Health Integration: At MEDVAMC, we have excellent integra - tion of Primary Care and Mental Health services to increase access to mental health care, de-stigmatize mental health disorders and provide a more holistic and successful approach to mental and physi - cal health problems. Our patients can see a Mental Health Provider on the same day they see their Primary Care Provider. Same day Mammograms - Our des - ignated Women's Health Providers provide comprehensive general primary care and gender-specific care to our female veterans. We currently have Mammogram services on site, and our veterans can get screening and diagnos - tic mammograms on the same day as their Primary Care appointment. VA Video Connect Visits - As part of a national VHA mandate, our Primary Care Providers at MEDVAMC are utilizing the VA Video Connect Visits to provide telehealth services using a secure video connection to address nearly any issue that does not require an in-person visit. The VA Video Connect can be used by any veteran who has video-capable technology such as a smartphone, tablet or computer. Musculoskeletal Clinic: In the past academic year, we have started a mus - culoskeletal clinic in Primary Care. Dr. Hendiani, who did a Sports Medicine Fellowship, evaluated more than 200 veterans for various musculoskeletal conditions. Several of them received corticosteroid or hyaluronic injections in various joints. We are planning on expanding the services utilizing ultra - sound and orthobiologics. Whole Health Initiative - The Whole Health initiative continues to build momentum and engagement in Primary Care and Health Promotion programs at MEDVAMC. Our staff are trained by Dr. Daniel DeBrule, who is our Health Behavior Coordinator/ Whole Health Director, regarding the model with emphasis on personalized health planning and connection with Complementary Medicine approaches such as Yoga, Tai Chi, Acupuncture and Guided Imagery. Personalized Health Planning has been conducted by several PCPs in Primary Care.

EHS is now in the final stages of negotiations with the UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Texas to provide and be reimbursed for comprehensive asthma management services (including home visits and supplies) for UHC members. The partners are also developing an innovative outcomes-based payment system to cover the services, which is expected to serve as a model for other asthma programs and health plans across the country. Community : Immediately after Hurricane Harvey, the EHS team was called on to help understand the immediate health risks caused by contact with floodwater and sediment and to explain these risks\u2014and appropriate safety precautions\u2014to the community. Along with partners at the Houston Health Department and Rice University, the EHS was in the field with New York Times Investigative journalists just days after the flood, collecting water and sludge samples from some of the most affected communities across Houston and interpreting the results. Nearly 100 members of the community came together on May 1 (World Asthma Day) for the first-ever Houston-Area Town Hall on Asthma. The community spoke about the burden of asthma and helped create a list of actions to make Houston more lung healthy. The Houston mayor's office presented BCM with a proc - lamation naming May \"Asthma Awareness Month.\" The event was hosted by EHS and the Harris Health System and funded through grants from The Jacob and Terese Hershey Foundation, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute.Education: The director of EHS, Dr. Winnie Hamilton, delivered a lecture titled \"Environmental Health: Time for an Upstream Approach,\" on April 26 for the Determinants, Disparities, and Social/ Population Health (DDASH) foundational sciences course at BCM.

The resulting article, \"Houston's Floodwaters Are Tainted, Testing Shows ,\" ran on Sept. 11; Dr. Hamilton was heavily cited in the article. Her work and that of several others who participated in the Times' analysis showed that two neighborhoods were contaminated with bac - teria and toxins, possibly a result of several waste treatment plants, and that many other areas were also unsafe owing to bacteria and mold Dr. Ricardo Nuila and Dr. Michelle Schmidt were invited to speak on Pacifica Radio 90.1 KPFT - \"So What's Your Story?\" in July 2018 Dr. Joslyn Fisher co-authored \"Intimate Partner Dr. Rola professor, General Internal Medicine, was interviewed by KPRC Channel 2 for an article about the VA's fastest growing patient population; young female veterans. She also interviewed for a March 30 segment on the Houston Public Media radio show Houston Matters. The segment covered a new VA campaign to curb harassment against female veterans 59October 2018 The Section of Geriatrics had a very challenging year. We survive and continue to deliver high quality, compassionate healthcare at many venues. At Houston Methodist Hospital (HMH), Geriatrics was ranked 29th in the nation out of 1,516 hospitals by U.S. News, and Baylor Geriatrics is the only Geriatrics at HMH. At Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center (BSLMC), Geriatrics was ranked as High Performing by U.S. News. Ownership changes at Park Plaza Hospital resulted in the displacement of our outpatient clinic. It was a very difficult move, but we have finally settled in affiliation with BSLMC to practice at Kirby Glen, a wonderful, accessible location less than 2 miles from the Medical Center. If the saying \"Nothing worthwhile is easy\" is true, then this arduous journey should lead us to the \"promised land\". We hope to have fellows, faculty, and nurses caring for older people in a smoothly operating practice soon while enjoying free parking and easy access. We were also able to celebrated Dr. Robert J. Luchi's 90th birthday. Dr. Luchi, who founded the Geriatrics section at BCM, and his wife, Jean, flew down from Kansas City for a wonderful opportunity, hosted by Rashmi Jaitly and the Huffington Center on Aging, to embrace suc - cessful aging and reflect on our incredible accomplishments. Baylor Geriatrics is unique in providing care in numerous sites across institutional and geographic lines. Our private practice sees inpatients in consultation at BSLMC and HMH, provides continuing care in facilities close to the medical center and provides outpatient wound care. Our Harris Health practices at Ben Taub General and Quentin Mease Hospitals remain active and Harris Health provides the support for our House Calls program. The House Calls team was featured in a number of media outlets including Houston's Channel 2. At the Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center, patient care is provided across the continuum from the nursing home (CLC) to the clinic with a growing interest in providing Geriatric and Palliative Care in hospi - tal and at home. We are honored to have the last of the \"Greatest Generation\" entrusted to our care at the VA. The CLC has moved up in quality over the past years. It is now ranked 9th out of 135 CLCs in the nation by SAIL quality measures. A recent visit to the CLC resulted in zero findings. Usually only 2-3 CLC's per year out of 135 achieve this distinction. We have developed wound care as an area of expertise, now providing outpatient wound care at BSLMC, HMH, MEDVAMC and to inpatients at HHS. Our Innovation interventions have decreased the exposure to drugs known to cause delirium for thousands of elders throughout the Methodist systems. Using EPIC to protect older patients from delirium was so novel that some of the team were invited to Wisconsin to the Epic User's Group Meeting to present their work.Section of Geriatrics OUR George Taffet Glencora Sharfman Susan Williams Nancy Wilson Section of GeriatricsOur faculty continues to play an important role training future clinicians and researchers in geriatrics and gerontology. Our edu - cational impact outweighs our modest size. The Geriatrics track for our BCM medical students is on hiatus, but the student interest group (SAGI) under the leadership of BCM medical student Koby Kaplan has been revitalized. Dr. Major has updated ARTS (Age- Related ThemeS), our didactic course that occurs at the end of the second year of medical school. The Capstone course, the last didactics before graduation for BCM students, includes important input from Geriatrics faculty including Ursula Braun. Every BCM student did a house call with Geriatrics faculty members; this is a unique teaching experience, reminding learners that patients are real people. The house calls clinicians take the medical student with a University of Houston pharmacy student to create an inter - disciplinary learning experience. We teach geriatrics to medicine core clerkship students monthly at Ben Taub Hospital. Many medical students choose electives with Geriatrics faculty. All BCM physician assistant students get training and mentorship at the MEDVAMC, coordinated in part by Mike Anderson, PA-C. To get a clinical perspective on their basic science work, Ph.D. candidates from the Huffington Center on Aging rotate with us. All upper-level BCM internal medicine residents spend four weeks on Geriatrics in a unique experience where they work for two weeks on the inpatient consult service at BSLMC and then spend two weeks out of the hospital exploring the continuum of care for older people. This innovation has been greatly appreciated and has a lasting impact. We also train BCM family medicine residents and HMH family and internal medicine residents in a variety of venues. The Geriatrics PA residency is the only one of its type in the nation, recruiting excellent candidates from across the nation to do additional training in Geriatrics with our faculty. Its success with two slots spurred an increase to three slots for January 2019. Our Geriatric fellowship program, led by Angela Catic, is among the largest and most sought after in the nation. Six first year fellows started in July and six graduated the day before. Annie Smith was our most famous graduating fellow, transported by a Houston Fire Department dump truck to the hospital to deliver Adrielle during the peak of Hurricane Harvey. Annie, husband Gregg, and Adrielle had the highest impact factor of any BCM member, appearing in hundreds of news outlets across the world, includ - ing the Washington Post and People magazine. Another fellow finished her second year with a focus on quality improvement as it relates to house calls. This unique focus led Claire Campbell to be recognized as a national leader for education in this area and was vital to our program being chosen to be 1 of 9 programs nationally who will participate in the new Learning Collaborative for Quality Improvement in House Calls. Another fellow, Mariam Ahmed, started her second year focused on wound care. Under the leadership of Aimee Garcia, BCM Geriatrics created the only Geriatrics based academic wound care fellowship in the nation. New fellowship slots in palliative care in collaboration with M.D. Anderson Hospital have been organized through the efforts of Drs. Braun and Syed Imam. These will be filled outside the \"match\" this year, but are planned as an important \"non-oncology\" focused component of the best in the nation M.D. Anderson palliative care training program. Our educa - tional efforts were not limited to trainees as BCM Geriatrics held its first CME course in June under the leadership of Syed Imam. It was well attended, very well received and laid the foundation for fur - ther courses. The Elder Investor Fraud program, led by Bob Roush, has trained physicians, lawyers and financial advisers in more than half the states and is soon to be made electronic. The true strength of our section is its people. Lurie McAdow, PA-C retired after more than twenty years of leading the PA efforts at the VA, and Rose Dust, PA-C, one of the early graduates of the PA residency in Geriatrics, moved from the MEDVAMC to Colorado. Mike Anderson, PA-C, another graduate of the PA residency in Geriatrics, joined and will help direct the residency program. Marcia Yparraguirre, our long term administrator and steady hand upon our tiller, is now leading the AMS/HHS relationship at UT Houston. Khelli Simpson, joined BCM Geriatrics from billing to lead administration for the Section. Don Chen, a former fellow who helped develop Home based care at the VA, left as well. Vinh Nguyen, one of our former fellows, returned from California to join the Home Based Primary Care program at the VA. Francisco Loaiciga joined the MEDVAMC to provide palliative care in the homes of dying veterans. Kayla Hall, a nurse practitioner on the house calls team, left to join Methodist Orthopedics. And Nancy Wilson, who brought appreciation of social workers to multitudes of Geriatrics physicians, retired as well. Our top-notch faculty received many accolades at the local and national levels. For example, we have more \"super docs\" than the other programs in Geriatrics in Houston. We represent BCM in major professional society meetings; our faculty holds leadership positions within the American Geriatrics Society, the Gerontological Society of America, American Academy of House Call Medicine and American Medical Directors Association.To advance the quality of late life through exemplary research, education, patient care, and community outreach. 61Geriatrics Section members contributed to research funding in 2018. While none of the funds gets directly credited to the Section, key collaborations with Psychiatry, Surgery, Otolaryngology, Endocrinology, Cardiovascular Research, Health Systems Research and industry were critical to the successes of our collaborators. With our colleagues in the Huffington Center on Aging, a large number of papers were published in scientific journals, including the top journal in our field, Journal of the American Geriatrics Society. The enduring products include a wonderful book, Ethical Considerations and Challenges in Geriatrics, edited by Angela Catic that featured contributions of many of the BCM Geriatrics faculty, fellows and former fellows. The faculty has made a large number of local and regional presentations. The fellows and faculty had a major presence at the BCM Housestaff Research Day with all fellows presenting their efforts during that event. Similarly, the presence of the Geriatrics Section made up almost all the clinical poster presentation at the annual HCOA day. In summary, despite the wandering in the desert this year, BCM Geriatrics faculty was able to keep their focus on the next gen - eration of providers and our mission \"to advance the quality of late life through exemplary research, education, patient care, and community outreach.\" Respectfully submitted, George E.

Since 2007, when Dr. Petersen became the Director and Section Chief, the number of funded investigators has grown over 125%, from 17 to 39 core members, and there have been 31 academic promotions among core faculty. In the past 23 years, 70 career development awards (CDA) have been funded (seven are current), including two recent HSR Section CDAs. Moreover, total grant funding has more than doubled, with over $16 million in research funding for FY18. We have a nearly 20-year tradition of conducting research in partnership with the health care delivery system and responding to its needs, making us pioneers in the execution of the learning health care system model. The IQuESt mission, \"improving health and well-being through innovations in health care delivery,\" emphasizes our commitment to transformative and innovative research. A learning health care system \"...is designed to generate and apply the best evidence for the collaborative health care choices of each patient and provider; to drive the process of discovery as a natural outgrowth of patient care; and to ensure innovation, quality, safety, and value in health care.\" Our model for the learning health care system is founded on strong partnerships with clinical and policy stakeholders, implementation of best evidence and evaluation to ensure a continuous cycle of learning and improvement. You will find IQuESt Investigators embedded within the clinical practice of Baylor St. Luke's Healthcare system, the Faculty Group Practice, Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center, Harris Health System, Texas Children's Hospital and many others. We emphasize communication, coordination and collaboration between clinical staff, communities and patients/families to achieve our goals of quality, effectiveness and safety and the whole health model. We will continue to grow cross-disciplinary teams of clinician scientists, social scientists and others who are embedded in the health systems to ensure better understanding of challenges and potential for healthcare improvement. IQuESt is ideally poised to contribute to making care more accessible, safer and more patient-centered with innovative research, rapid implementation of evidence, novel methodologies that match the complexity of problems under study, solid partnerships that are built on decades of work, key stakeholder engagement, career development of future scientists and infrastructure to promote a learning health care system within Baylor College of Medicine.

Health care professionals have difficulty differentiating cases of ASB from catheter- associated urinary tract infections. A multifaceted intervention targeting health care profession - als who diagnose and treat patients with urinary catheters reduced overtreatment of ASB compared with standard quality improvement methods. These improvements persisted during a low-intensity maintenance period. The impact was more pronounced in long-term care, an emerging domain for antimi - crobial stewardship.

Telemedicine journal and e- health : The official journal of the American Telemedicine Association. 2015 Jun 1; 21(6):467-72. PMID: 25714664 Increasing access to psychotherapy for PTSD is a primary focus of the VA healthcare system. Delivery of treat - ment via video telehealth can expand availability of treatment and be equally effective as in-person treatment. Development of specific strategies is needed to implement video telehealth services in complex healthcare systems, like the VA. This project conducted at 5 CBOCs was guided by the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services framework and used external facilitation to increase access to psychotherapy via video telehealth. Findings suggest that external facilitation is an effective and acceptable strategy to support providers as they establish clinics and make complex practice changes, such as implementing video telehealth to deliver psychotherapy. System Improvements Singh H , Sittig DF. Advancing the science of measurement of diagnostic errors in healthcare: The Safer Dx framework. BMJ Qual Saf. 2015 Feb;24(2):103-10. Diagnostic errors are major contributors to harmful patient outcomes, yet they remain a relatively understudied and unmeasured area of patient safety. Although they are estimated to affect about 12 million Americans each year in ambulatory care settings alone, both the conceptual and pragmatic scientific foundation for their measurement is under- developed. Health care organizations do not have the tools and strategies to mea - sure diagnostic safety and most have not integrated diagnostic error into their existing patient safety programs. Further progress toward reducing diagnostic errors will hinge on our ability to overcome measurement- related challenges. In order to lay a robust groundwork for measurement and monitoring techniques to ensure diagnostic safety, we recently developed a multifaceted framework to advance the science of measuring diagnostic errors (The Safer Dx framework). We posit that the Safer Dx framework can be used by a variety of stakeholders including researchers, clinicians, health care organizations and policymakers, to stimulate both retrospec - tive and more proactive measurement of diagnostic errors. The feedback and learning that would result will help develop sub - sequent interventions that lead to safer diagnosis, improved value of health care delivery and improved patient outcomes. Singh H , Sittig DF. Measuring and improving patient safety through health information technology: The Health IT Safety Framework. BMJ Qual Saf. 2015. Sep 14. Epub ahead of print. Health information technology (health IT) has potential to improve patient safety but its implementation and use have led to unintended consequences and new safety concerns. A key challenge to improving safety in health IT-enabled health - care systems is to develop valid, feasible strategies to measure safety concerns at the intersection of health IT and patient safety. In response to the fundamental conceptual and meth - odological gaps related to both defining and measuring health IT-related patient safety, we propose a new framework, the Health IT Safety (HITS) measurement framework, to provide a conceptual foundation for health IT-related patient safety measurement, monitoring, and improvement. The framework proposes to integrate both retrospective and prospective measurement of HIT safety with an organization's existing clinical risk management and safety programs. It aims to facilitate organizational learning, comprehensive 360 degree assessment of HIT safety that includes vendor involvement, refinement of measurement tools and strategies, and shared responsibility to identify problems and implement solutions. A long term framework goal is to enable rigorous measurement that helps achieve the safety benefits of health IT in real-world clinical settings. Menon S, Murphy DR, Singh H, Meyer AN , Sittig DF. Workarounds and Test Results Follow-up in Electronic Health Record- Based Primary Care. Applied clinical informatics. 2016 Jun 22; 7(2):543-59. Electronic health records (EHRs) have potential to facilitate reliable communication and follow-up of test results. However, limitations in EHR functionality remain, leading practitioners to use workarounds while managing test results. Workarounds can lead to patient safety concerns and signify indications as to how to build better EHR systems that meet provider needs. We conducted a secondary data analysis of quantitative and qualitative data from a national survey of PCPs practicing in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and explored the use of workarounds in test results management. We used multivariate logistic regression analysis to examine the association between key sociotechnical factors that could affect test results follow-up (e.g., both technology-related and those unrelated to technology, such as organizational support for patient notification) and workaround use. We conducted a qualitative content analysis of free text survey data to exam - ine reasons for use of workarounds. Workarounds to manage EHR- based test results are common, and their use results from unmet provider information management needs. Future EHRs and the respective work systems around them need to evolve to meet these needs. Naik AD, Martin LA , Moye J, Karel MJ. Health Values and Treatment Goals of Older, Multimorbid Adults Facing Life- Threatening Illness. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society. 2016 Mar 1; 64(3):625-31. This publication was cited in The John A. Hartford Foundation Change AGEnts Initiative white paper \"Patient-Centered Medical Homes and the Care of Older Adults: How comprehensive care coordination, community connections, and person-directed care can make a difference\". The paper provides a roadmap to guide primary care practices in how to enhance care for older, complex patients and their families. VHA Directive 1088 Dr. Hardeep Singh co-chaired a work-group under The Office of Patient Care Services (10P4) to revise a previous directive (VHA Directive 2009-019) and to establish new national policy regarding communication of test results to providers and patients. Timely communication of test results is essential to ensuring safe and effective health care. Lack of timely follow-up of abnormal test results has been identified as a contributor to poor outcomes and can be a source of considerable anxiety to patients and families. The Directive cites 11 publications from center members and provides policies and guidance on how to improve timeliness of follow-up of test results and is consistent with VHA's goals of providing Veterans with quality health care. The Directive is now in place at all 150-plus VA facilities and impacting care for millions of veterans. Explicit Quality Indicator Set for Measurement of Quality of Care in Patients with Cirrhosis Dr. Fasiha Kanwal's work in cirrhosis quality measure devel - opment led to implementation of a performance measure as part of the Centers for Medicare and Medicare Service pay for performance program (HCC screening). This measure was also selected to be part of the GI measure set in AHIP, which is a national association representing nearly 1300 member com - panies providing health insurance coverage to more than 200 million Americans.Research Product Murphy DR, Meyer AN , Bhise V, Russo E, Sittig DF, Wei L, Wu L, Singh H. Computerized Triggers of Big Data to Detect Delays in Follow-up of Chest Imaging Results. Chest. 2016 Sep 1;150(3):613-20. We applied a trigger in a repository hosting EHR data from all Department of Veterans Affairs health-care facilities and analyzed data from seven facilities. Using literature reviews and expert input, we refined previously developed trigger criteria designed to identify patients potentially experiencing delays in diagnostic evaluation of chest imaging flagged as \"suspicious for malignancy.\" The trigger then excluded patients in whom further evaluation was unnecessary (ie, those with terminal illnesses or with already completed biopsies). The criteria were programmed into a computerized algorithm. Reviewers examined a random sample of trigger-positive (ie, patients with trigger-identified delay) and trigger-negative (ie, patients with an abnormal imaging result but no delay) records and con - firmed the presence or absence of delay or need for additional tracking (eg, repeat imaging in 6 months). Analysis included calculating the trigger's diagnostic performance (ie, positive pre - dictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity, specificity). Application of triggers on \"big\" EHR data may aid in identifying patients experiencing delays in diagnostic evaluation of chest imaging results suspicious for malignancy. METHODS AND PRODUCTS 2X2 Functional Health Literacy/Patient Activation Matrix (PI: LeChauncy Woodard) The Functional Health Literacy/Activation Matrix tool was devel - oped to provide personalized health information to clinicians to improve communication and coordination of self-management at the point of care. Functional Health Literacy (FHL) and Patient Activation levels are directly related to levels of motivation to participate in chronic disease self-management. By classifying veterans into high/low categories for both FHL and Patient Activation, the 2x2 Literacy/Activation Matrix provides a con - crete description of a prototypical veteran in each quadrant and suggests corresponding actions and communication strategies for clinicians to uniquely target self-management plans with Veterans. By assessing Veterans' levels of Functional Health Literacy (FHL) and Patient Activation a priori, providers were able to tailor and personalize their approach to collaborative goal-setting. This personalization helped optimize chronic dis - ease self-management for a costly population of Veterans with treated by uncontrolled Type II Diabetes Mellitus. Section of Health Services Research 67 AWARE: Alerts, Watch and Response Engine (PI: Hardeep Singh) Abnormal test results do not always receive timely follow-up, even when providers are notified through electronic health record (EHR)-based alerts. Follow-up to abnormal test results in the outpatient setting is an important safety issue. The Houston Patient Safety team developed and did preliminary usability testing on a prototype software system to detect abnormal test result alerts lacking documented follow-up, and to present context-specific reminders to providers called the Alert Watch And Response Engine (AWARE). CAUTI: Catheter Associated Urinary Tract Infection Intervention (PI: Barbara Trautner) With VA HSR&D funding, we have developed an intervention to encourage guideline compliant practices concerning antibiotic use for urinary tract infections. Specifically we used audit and feedback plus a \"fast and frugal\" algorithm to substitute incor - rect biases towards excessive use of antibiotics for prescribing decisions that were compliant with guidelines. CBOC Mental Health Grand Rounds Program (PI: Mark Kunik) The CBOC Mental Health Grand Rounds program is a partner - ship between the South Central Mental Illness, Research and Clinical Center (SC MIRECC) and Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Employee Education System (EES). Nationally known speakers from the VA and academia are invited to talk about cutting edge topics & evidence-based practices that address the mental health care needs of rural Veterans. The monthly live meetings are made available to CBOCs and parent facilities in VISN 16 through the VA Knowledge Network. Select programs are archived for delayed viewing. The VA EES provides Continuing Education Credits for a number of healthcare disciplines. CPRS View Alert Notification Checklist Improve CPRS 'View Alert' Notifications: Recommendations for VA Facility Leadership and Staff was developed by the Houston Patient Safety team and a group of subject matter experts to assist VHA facilities in addressing the complexities involved in managing View Alerts. The Checklist provides facility leaders and staff with actionable, practical rec - ommendations in a checklist-based format to ensure that View Alert notifications remain valuable for patient care.Methods and Products continued CTR Toolkit: Communication of Test Results Toolkit (PI: Hardeep Singh) The Houston Patient Safety team and a VA Workgroup com - prised of subject matter experts developed a toolkit that offers practical guidance for facilities and clinical care teams to meet the requirements of VHA Directive 1088 for timely communi - cation of test results to patients. The objectives of the toolkit are to: 1) describe useful practices, example workflows, and processes necessary to implement a safe, effective, and effi - cient method of timely outpatient test result communication to providers and patients; and 2) provide recommendations for system-level monitoring of outpatient test result communica - tion to patients, and define the parameters and methodology involved in achieving this. Topics addressed include test result follow-up responsibilities, test result categories, CPRS View Alerts, team-based approaches to facilitate test result fol - low-up, vulnerable areas including handoffs in care, current methods to notify patients and measurement and reporting of test result notification. Customized Peer Facility Groups for VISNs (PI : Laura Petersen) Dr. Laura Petersen's team created customized peer facility groups for VISNs. These peer facility groups allow Network man - agers to fairly compare their facilities (often of varying sizes, scopes of service, and missions) to facilities in other Networks. In the past 13 years, 11 VISNs have sought out our team to provide peer facility groups for quality and efficiency compari - sons and to help with resource allocation. VISNs 11 and 12 have reported continuous use of the Houston-generated peer groups across their component facilities since 2004. EHR Trigger Tool Methodology (PI: Hardeep Singh) The EHR Trigger Tool Methodology was developed for mining EHR data to detect delays in diagnostic evaluation of cancer. The computerized algorithms and SQL code to mine this data are products of this methodology. This tool is related to the Houston CREATE Project. Manualized Motivational Interviewing and Behavioral Health Guides for Chronic Disease Self-Management (PI: Jeff Cully) A pair of manuals was developed to guide the structure and delivery of a motivational interviewing and behavioral health intervention to improve chronic disease self-management. The manual reviewed by patients guided the content of the group sessions and ensured that materials were easily understood, even for those veterans with limited health literacy. The clinician manual contained the whole of the veteran manual, with spe - cific notations and instructions for leading veterans through the group sessions. Together the manuals provided assurance for successful delivery of and fidelity to the content. Section of Health Services Research NLP/ Structured Data Element Integration in EHRs (PI: Salim Virani) Natural Language Processing (NLP) was applied to the problem of ensuring that patients receive evidence-based medication prescribing for cardiovascular disease. The CREATE 4 project developed a method to incorporate NLP with structured data elements from the electronic health record to provide decision support to clinicians at the point of care. The effectiveness of this method in improving care for lipid disease will be tested in new HSRD IIR that will start in FY 17. SAFER Guides (PI: Hardeep Singh) Dr. Singh's Houston Patient Safety Center team worked with researchers at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston's School of Biomedical Informatics as well as research - ers at the Oregon Health and Science University, the research corporation Westat, and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), who sponsored the project, to develop self-assessment guides intended to help organizations proactively detect and reduce patient safety risks associated with electronic health records (EHRs). This group collaboratively developed and beta tested guides for nine different areas that contain recommended practices for optimizing the safety and use of EHRs. These guides are freely available nationally and are being increasingly used by both organizations and vendors. VA Directive 1088 (PI: Hardeep Singh) The Houston Patient Safety team worked with The Office of Patient Care Services (10P4) to revise the previous directive (VHA Directive 2009-019) to establish policy regarding com - munication of test results to providers and patients. VHA is committed to the timely communication of test results, which is essential to ensuring safe and effective health care. Timely com - munication of test results to patients is essential for high quality patient-centered care. Lack of timely follow-up of abnormal test results has been identified as a contributor to poor outcomes and can be a source of considerable anxiety to patients and families. Patient involvement in test result follow-up is funda - mental to improve safety in this area and is consistent with personalized proactive patient-driven care. Patients have a right to access personal health information and expect to be notified of test results in a timely manner. Enhancing timeliness of fol - low-up of test results is consistent with VHA's goals of providing Veterans with quality health care. IDENTIFY: Toolkit for Patient Identification (PI: Hardeep Singh) A Toolkit for the use of health IT in patient identification designed to improve health IT safety. This toolkit is the result of a multi-stakeholder collaborative workgroup chaired by Dr. Hardeep Singh through the Partnership for Health IT Patient Safety. This is the second set of Safe Practice Recommendations for the use of health IT in patient identification designed to improve health IT safety. IDENTIFY stands for: 1) INCLUDE: electronic fields containing patient identification data should consistently use standard identifier conventions; 2) DETECT: use a confirmation process to help match the patient and the docu - mentation; 3) EVALUATE: use standard attributes and attribute formats in all transactions to improve matching; 4): NORMALIZE: use a standard display of patient attributes across the various systems; 5): TAILOR: include distinguishing information enhanc - ing identification on screens printouts, and those areas that require interventions; 6): INNOVATE: integrate new technologies to facilitate and enhance identification; 7): FOLLOW-UP: imple - ment monitoring systems to readily detect identification errors; 8). YIELD: include high-specificity active alerts and notifications to facilitate proper identification. 69AWARDS & HONORS AMSPOKER Journal Editorial Board: Clinical Gerontologist Journal Editorial Board: Journal of Clinical Psychology in Medical Settings BADR Co-Leader, Cancer Prevention and Population Sciences Program, Dan L.

We are a small faculty, but truly represent the \"little engine that could.\" Our faculty, trainees and staff make important contributions to the education, research and clinical missions of Baylor College of Medicine, which we herein recognize. First, I would like to thank Dr. David Corry for his leadership and service to our Section. Dr. Corry has served as Chief of our Section since 2011. Under his leadership, the section has developed a strong foundation of excellence in medical education, research and patient care upon which we will grow in coming years. In February of 2018, Dr. Corry transitioned to the role of Vice-Chair of Immunology in the Department of Pathology, while maintaining many of his commitments to our Section. As such, I was appointed Chief of the Section of Immunology, Allergy and Rheumatology in February of 2018. In the past year, faculty members in the Section have published 46 peer-reviewed manuscripts. Research programs were supported by 14 grants from the National Institutes of Health, CPRIT and foundations, including one grant supporting the start of our clinic trials program. Faculty members have also given 12 invited seminars to local, national and international audiences. Finally, our Section is the home of the Biology of Inflammation Center, which provides research and educational support for immune-related diseases across the entire College. I would also like to recognize all of the important contributions that our Section makes in the clinical and educational missions. Our physicians provide outstanding, patient-centered care across all of our clinical pavilions, including the Baylor Clinic, Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center, the Michael E. Debakey VA Medical Center, Texas Children's Hospital, Harris Health Smith Clinic and Ben Taub General Hospital. All levels of trainees, including medical students, graduate students, physician-assistant students, internal medicine residents, postdoctoral fellows and clinical fellows benefit greatly from our commitment to mentoring and teaching. Our clinical fellowship training programs, led by Dr. Agarwal (Rheumatology) and Dr. Corry (Immunology and Allergy), are completely dedicated to the clinical and scholarly development of our fellows and continue to train outstanding physicians. This report contains some of the achievements of the year past. This is our foundation from which we will build the future of Immunology, Allergy and Rheumatology at Baylor College of Medicine. I am honored and excited to lead our Section into a bright future. Sandeep K.
