Look no further than our Inner Balance Crystal Bracelet Collection! Whether you wear it on its own or stack it with other bracelets, this stunning piece is sure to turn heads. With its vibrant crystal colours, it's the perfect way to add some extra pizzazz to any outfit. With its traditional style of wellness bracelets, each piece is lovingly handmade with high-quality materials, including - 8mm crystal beads that are a mix of raw, unpolished beads and polished beads. - 1 x 10mm accent bead to add a touch of glamour, and you can choose from 14K Gold Fill, 14K Rose Gold Fill, or Sterling Silver to match your style. To help you tap into the unique properties of each crystal, we include a crystal properties card with each bracelet. And with multiple size options available, you can find the perfect fit for your wrist. Each order comes packaged in a cotton muslin bag, making it a great gift for yourself or someone special. Please note that all raw, unpolished beads will eventually absorb oils from your skin, which may alter their appearance over time. To keep your bracelet looking its best, avoid overstretching the elastic and simply roll it over your hand or wrist for a comfortable fit that will last.
