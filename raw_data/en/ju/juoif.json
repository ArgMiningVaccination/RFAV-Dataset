Fortify your immune system: Stress, lack of sleep, poor diet, lack of exercise and unhealthy living, as well as underlying health conditions can all undermine your immune system. Vitamin D3 may be more effective than vaccines at preventing influenza infections because it supports immune system function during the winter when many people become deficient in this essential hormone due to lack of sunlight. The herbal tincture of Echinacea taken regularly is also linked to immune boosting. Nutritionally, garlic is said to be a natural antibiotic. A whole clove of garlic crushed and mixed with honey is said to help the body fight off infection. Early nights and uninterrupted sleep, whenever possible, will allow your body to rest and recover. For those of you living and working in towns, exercise needn't be reserved for weekends or late night gym sessions. Get on your bike. Cycling to work is a fantastic way to frame a sedentary day at the office with immune, metabolism and general health boosting exercise. 2. Respiratory System protection: For those of you forced into crowded tubes or buses or plane travel with coughing and spluttering commuters a fantastic tip and first line of defence for the respiratory system is the use of Essential oils. Rosemary is an uplifting oil, ideal for the morning commute. Mix a drop or 2 in a teaspoon of almond or olive oil and dab around the nostrils. As long as you can smell the rosemary it will be acting as a antiseptic to any nasty antigens making their way into your respiratory system. Lavender can be applied if you are after some shut eye, useful for long-haul flights, as it is a calming and sedentary oil. (Do not use Rosemary essential oil during pregnancy and Lavender essential should not be used during the first Trimester of pregnancy) [Support for pregnancy & childbirth during CoVid-19 self-isolation.](http://www.greendaisies.co.uk/site/2020/03/pregnancy-birth-support-during-covid-19/) 3. Homeopathic Remedies for 'Flu symptoms: Use homeopathy to nip a cold in the bud at the on-set of cold or 'flu like symptoms. One pillule or tablet can be taken once a hour for 3 hours or stop with improvement. Change to an alternative remedy when the symptoms develop, with remedies indicated that may address the sensation of heaviness; aches and pains in the joints or muscles; high fevers. Repeat a remedy as often as needed as long as it is helping, even every 15 minutes and stop with improvement. The fever is the body's natural immune response to a virus. A fever is produced by the body to burn off the virus. To force the fever down when it is stable and not at a dangerous level is potentially going against the natural immune response. Homeopathic remedies may support this process and may help to stabilise the fever. Reach for a homeopathic remedy and apply a tepid sponge to the face. For gastric 'flu symptoms with vomiting and diarrhoea use the indicated homeopathic remedy for support. If you suspect you have CoVid-19 seek immediate medical advice.
