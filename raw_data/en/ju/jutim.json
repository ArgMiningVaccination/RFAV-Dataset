What is rubella? Rubella is a contagious illness caused by a virus. Rubella is also known as 'German measles', but it is different to the illness caused by the measles virus. Some people with rubella do not have symptoms at all. For others, infection can cause a mild illness with fever and a red rash. Rubella is usually not dangerous. But babies, of people who catch rubella during pregnancy, can be seriously affected. Rubella is now rare in Australia thanks to childhood [vaccination](/immunisation-and-vaccinations-for-your-child) programs. Outbreaks can still occur among people who are not immune. This page focuses on advice for adults and children aged above 5 years. You can find information about [rubella during pregnancy](https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/rubella-and-pregnancy) and [in babies and younger children](https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/rubella-in-babies-and-children) on the Pregnancy, Birth and Baby website. What are the symptoms of rubella? About 1 in every 2 people who catch rubella do not have any symptoms. People without symptoms can still spread the infection to others. People with rubella who feel unwell usually notice symptoms about 2 - 3 weeks after contact with a person infected with the virus. Symptoms are usually mild, and include: - red rash - mild [fever](/fever) [headache](/headaches) [swollen glands](/swollen-glands) - runny nose - joint pain - sore red eyes Most people with symptoms recover in about 3 days.

What causes rubella and how is it spread? A virus causes rubella. Rubella spreads through contact with an infected person's breathing fluids, for example, if they cough or sneeze nearby. Rubella can also spread through direct contact with an infected person. In pregnant people, rubella can travel in their blood and infect their developing babies. Babies who become infected during pregnancy can spread rubella after they are born. This is through their breathing fluids and urine. It can happen for months or potentially more than a year. If you have rubella, it is important to [stay home from childcare, school or work](/school-exclusion-periods) to stop you spreading the infection to others. Rubella stops being contagious when you are completely well, or 4 days after you first see the rash \u2014 whichever is first. Ask your doctor if you are unsure when it is safe for you or your child to return to work or school. Rubella is a [notifiable disease](/notification-of-illness-and-disease). This means that a doctor who diagnoses rubella needs to report it to the local health authorities. It is important for local health authorities to know about cases of rubella in the community. This is so they can take steps to control an outbreak and protect people who may be at risk. Who is at risk of getting rubella? Anyone of any age can catch rubella if they are not [immune](/immune-system). You are immune to rubella if you have been sick with it in the past or received a course of rubella vaccinations. In Australia, people born before 1966 are generally considered to be immune because it is likely that they caught rubella in childhood. What should I know about rubella and pregnancy? Rubella can be harmful to developing babies if their mothers become infected \u2014 especially during the first 10 weeks of [pregnancy](/pregnancy). Rubella infection during pregnancy can lead to a condition called congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). This syndrome can cause a range of birth defects. About 9 out of 10 babies, born to people who catch rubella during the first trimester of pregnancy, become affected by CRS. Birth defects associated with CRS include: - low birthweight [cognitive impairment](/cognitive-impairment) [hearing loss](/hearing-loss) - eye problems, [such as cataracts](/cataracts) Rubella vaccination is not recommended during pregnancy. If you are planning a pregnancy, see your doctor for a [pre-conception health check](https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/planning-for-your-pregnancy). This usually includes making sure that you are immune to infections like rubella. Your doctor will check your vaccination history and sometimes refer you for a blood test. It is also a good opportunity to ask about any [vaccines](/vaccinations-and-pregnancy) recommended for you before you try to conceive. When should I see my doctor? You should see your doctor if you think you or your child may have rubella. It is important to get a diagnosis from a doctor, as many other illnesses have symptoms like rubella. Since rubella is contagious, it is important to call ahead before you visit your doctor. This is so the staff can arrange for you to sit away from other patients in the clinic. Ask your doctor about the possibility of a home visit or telehealth appointment, such as a phone or video call. Most cases of rubella are not dangerous and get better on their own. If you or your child have severe symptoms, or have concerns about your health, see your doctor. Severe symptoms may also be a sign that you have an illness other than rubella that may need medical treatment. If you are pregnant and you think that you may have rubella or may have had contact with an infected person, see your doctor or midwife urgently for advice.
