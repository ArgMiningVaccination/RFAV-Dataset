Rather, it was a troubling statistic delivered by internationally renowned psychiatrist Vikram Patel in an inspiring, solutions-oriented keynote address at UC Global Health Day on April 22. May 3, 2018 May 3, 2018 \u2014 Academy Award-nominated cinematographer Bradford Young was at UC San Diego April 27, sharing insight into his craft and career as a black artist. Young\u2014the first speaker in the Adam D. Kamil Guest Lecture series\u2014first met privately with students from the Department of Visual Arts and then held a public discussion at the Price Center Theater. May 1, 2018 May 1, 2018 \u2014 The All of Us Research Program officially opens for enrollment Sunday, May 6. Led by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), All of Us is an unprecedented effort to gather genetic, biological, environmental, health and lifestyle data from 1 million or more volunteer participants living in the United States. A major component of the federal Precision Medicine Initiative, the program's ultimate goal is to accelerate research and improve health. April 30, 2018 April 30, 2018 \u2014 Hafner-Burton's passion and dedication to protecting human rights carries through her teaching and research. As such, she was selected to be one of six UC San Diego faculty members honored at the 44th annual Chancellor's Associates Faculty Excellence Awards for going above and beyond to make a positive difference in their teaching, research and service. April 30, 2018 April 30, 2018 \u2014 Mati Kahru, a research oceanographer at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego, led an international team of scientists in an analysis of 40 years of satellite observations of cyanobacteria blooms in the Baltic Sea. They found that the algae were detected in very high concentrations every three years followed by one or two years of substantially lower concentrations. What the researchers cannot do at the moment is understand why. April 30, 2018 April 30, 2018 \u2014 By stretching the amount of time proteins can be simulated in their natural state of wiggling and gyrating, a team of researchers at Colorado State University -- using supercomputers at the San Diego Supercomputer Center at UC San Diego and the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center -- has identified a critical protein structure that could serve as a molecular Achilles heel able to inhibit the replication of dengue virus and potentially other flaviviruses such as West Nile and Zika virus. April 30, 2018 April 30, 2018 \u2014 University of California San Diego Department of History professor Karl Gerth was awarded two prestigious fellowships totaling $145,000 to further his research on the implications of Chinese consumerism. April 30, 2018 April 30, 2018 \u2014 Patients with rare brain tumors on the auditory nerve now have an option to prevent complete deafness at UC San Diego Health. The device, called an auditory brainstem implant or ABI, fits behind the ear and connects directly to the brainstem. The device enables patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) who develop bilateral hearing nerve tumors to be aware of environmental sounds, such as a door opening, a phone ringing or a car approaching. April 26, 2018 April 26, 2018 \u2014 Researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine are preparing a first-of-its-kind, multidisciplinary investigation to determine if and how cannabidiol, a non-psychoactive compound found in the cannabis plant, provides therapeutic benefit to children with severe symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. April 26, 2018 April 26, 2018 \u2014 As scientists get closer and closer to being able to bring extinct animals back to life, big questions emerge. What led to extinction in the first place? What would be the impacts on other species or the environment? Just because we can do it, does that "}
