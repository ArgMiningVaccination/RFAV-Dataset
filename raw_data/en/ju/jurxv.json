The ABOs reflect essential for an entry -level pharmacist to practice collaboratively as a member of an interprofessional team, provide patient -centered care, contribute to the health of diverse patient populations, demonstrate leadership, and effe ctively manage a complex work environment. Based on the ABOs, the curriculum synchronizes and integrates didactic education with experiential experiences to prepare students with the professional competencies to enter pharm acy practice in any setting, ensure - 6 - optimal medication therapy outcomes and patient safety, satisfy the educational requirements for licensure as a pharmacist, and meet the requirements of the University for the Degree. Curricular Structure The PharmD program is composed of 2 -3 years of pre-pharmacy coursework and 4 years of professional coursework (P1 -P4). The professional program cons ists of 6 semesters of didactic coursework in P1 to P3, and 314.5 hours of IPPE during P1 to P3 including the summer terms (Appendix 10B ). The P4 year enta APPE (Five 8 -week rotations ). All courses in the curriculum are mapped to ACPE Standards 2016 Appendix 1 ( Appendix 10 C) and to the Ability -Based Outcomes (Appendix 10D ). Instructors identify elements from their courses and designate the depth of instruction (introduced, reinforced, applied, mastery) for each Appendix 1 content area. Six credits of e lective coursework are included in the curricular structure and t he Professional Elective Policy with a list of approved electives (Appendix 10E) is published in the student handbook. Five of the eight APPE rotations are required including: ambulatory care, acute care, institutional, community, and rural health. The remaini ng three rotations are electives chosen by students according to their personal and professional preferences. According to SOP Experiential Education Policy, students do n ot receive payment for participating in IPPE or APPE experiences nor are they placed in an experiential site in which they are currently employed as a pharmacy intern . Curricular Design The professional curriculum is design ed to sequence and integrate content. It is intentionally progressive, introducing knowledge, skills , and abilities early with spiraling back to promote application and reinforcement . The P1 year is focused on scientific foundational knowledge in pathophysi ology, pharmaceutics, and pharmacology with an introduction to patient care (ie. the Pharmacists Patient Care Process \u2014PPCP) , interprofessional teamwork and healthcare systems. Skill practice takes place P1 spring in the Pharmacy Practice laboratory I (PHRM 351L) course. In summer follow ing the P1 year , students take their first IPPE course (PHRM 355) allowing for application of P1 knowledge, skills and abilities to institutional settings . The P2 year is centered on organ system pharmacodynamics, in terprofessional health care, and initial pharmacotherapy coursework with applications of the PPCP . The second Pharmacy Practice laboratory II (PHRM 455L) course progress es in knowledge, skills and abilities learned from the first course . Students embark on their second IPPE experience f ollow ing the P2 year with application of knowledge, skills and abilities to community settings. The P3 year focuses on pharmacotherapy and practice readiness , including two semesters of Pharmacy Practice Laboratory (PHRM 551L, 552L) for skills practice . The P3 spring features a Pharmacotherapy Capstone course to integrate foundational sciences, pharmacotherapeutic principles, patient assessment and clinical problem solving (i.e. PPCP) across multiple disease states . The program concludes with APPE where mastery of knowledge, skills , and abilities , including the PPCP takes place. Course pre-requisites ensure students have the knowledge base, acquired skills and have achieve d educational outcomes before - 7 - progressing to subsequent courses . The co -curriculum runs alongside the curriculum and is intentionally designed to augment and advance learning within the curriculum. Pharmacists' Patient Care Process The PPCP model of care is integrated within the curriculum (Append ix 10 F). Introduction to the PPCP takes place in the P1 year (PHRM 340 and PHRM 350) when students practice collecting patient information and learn to write the \"S\" and \"O\" sections of a SOAP note. Reinforcement and application occurs in IPPE I and II, when students collaborate with other members of the healthcare team, practice interprofessional communication and documentation skills, make OTC recommendations, and observe preceptors who conduct PPCP in institutional and community pharmac y practice settings. Reinforcement of the PPCP continues in P2 and P3 years as students progress through pharmacotherap y and pharma cy practice laboratory courses, practicing collection and assessment of patient information, documentation, and formulation o f plans including appropriate monitoring, referral, patient education and follow up. Curricular gap analysis and program self -assessment led to curricular improvements and gap closures related to the PPCP over the last 5 years, including implementation o f a new Pharmacotherapy Lab course (PHRM 545L) with additional guided practice in the PPCP. An analysis of PCOA scores (Appendix 10 G) during the P3 year show competence in Patient Assessment (68% correct in 2019), Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutic Decision Making (64% correct in 2019) and Evidence -Based Practice (70% correct in 2019). In the P4 year, students develop mastery of the PPCP during their APPE rotations. P receptors' mean evaluations o f APPE students ( scale 1 -5) in all PPCP -related ABOs. All faculty are required to complete a 1 hour training module about the PPCP and is a regular component of preceptor training. P4 students also educate preceptors on the PPCP (see Standard 20). Professional Attit udes and Behaviors The curriculum builds and assesses professional attitudes and behaviors leading to personal and professional maturity consistent with the Oath of the Pharmacist. Students recite the Oath at the ir White Coat Ceremony as P1s and at a Hooding ceremony upon graduation. Students develop professional behavior and attitudes engaging in didactic coursework and content such as laboratory simulations (P1 . Longitudinal assessment of professionalism is achieved through programmatic assessment of ABO 4 (Personal and Professional Development) competency achievement (discussed in Standard 4) , professionalism misconduct forms tracked by the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development (ADSA&FD) , practice -based professionalism assessed in laboratories, self -, peer -, and preceptor - evaluations , and reflections associated with didactic and co -curricular activities. Decision making for and content of elective courses may contribute to professionalism. Teaching and Learning To specify faculty expertise to teach in the PharmD program, the Curriculum Committee reviews the content of SOP courses and provides this information to the Department Chairs. The Dean of the College ensures faculty academic credentials and expertise alig n with teaching responsibilities following Policy 1.10 - 8 - Instructional Faculty Qualifications ( Appendix 10 H). All faculty teaching courses in the SOP have a terminal degree and/or significant relevant experience in the field ( Appendix 10 I). A variety of tea ching and active learning methods designed for diverse learners are employed throughout the curriculum ( Appendix 10J). While the majority of instruction targets visual, auditory and reading/writing types of learners, kinesthetic learning techniques are employed, especially in Pharmacy Practice labs. Nearly all courses employ techniques that actively engage learners and promote self -directed learning. Examples of instructional methods and tools used by faculty to integrate and reinforce content, foster li fe-long learning, and incorporate meaningful interprofessional learning can be found in Appendices 10 K-M. Typically, instruction in the experiential program with a student to preceptor ratio of 2:1 also allow s for individualized attention to student learning needs. A variety of techniques are used by instructors to provide formative feedback to students. Many instructors use Response Ware for in -class formative assessment and feedback. Several courses solicit formative feedback on instruction throughout the course so that students may express concerns related to teaching and learning in real time . Students give summative feedback to all faculty at the end of each course in a Student Rating of Instruction (SROI) in accordance with university policy. SROI feedback is reviewed by the faculty member, Department Chair, and the Curriculum Committee as part of the systematic course evaluation process described in Standard 2 4. Students also evaluate preceptors after each experiential rotation. Preceptors have access to reviews once they have been evaluated by 3 students to ensure students remain anonymous . The Dean's Liaison Committee consisting of student leaders throughout the College meets regularly with the ADSA&FD to discuss issues pertinent to them . Through this forum, students are able to provide feedback and express any concerns they may have wit h the curriculum or its delivery . Each class also elects a representative who discusses course issues with faculty members on behalf of the class. Student Learning Outcomes Assessment Summative assessment of student learning is facilitated by the use of ExamSoft . One advantage of electronic exam software is the potential to decrease incidents of academic dishonesty that can occur with paper and pencil testing. Taking it a step further, t he SOP implemented Policy 3.30 Examination Administration in fall 2018 to standardize exam procedures and promote academic integrity (Appendix 10 N). This policy reinforces the College Policy 3.01 addressing expected academic and conduct standards that students sign at the beginning of each year ( Appendix 10 O). The Student Learning Outcomes Assessment (SLOA) Plan ( Appendix 10 P) details the assessment of student achievement of ABOs and program effectiveness. The SLOA Report ( Appendix 10 Q) is derived from the SLOA plan and is used to highlight achievements and mark areas for needed changes in the curriculum. For example, a portion of the SLOA Report generated at the end of the 2017 -2018 academic year indicated few learning opportunities, few assessments and relatively poor performance in the didactic curriculum related to ABO 3.5 - Cultural Sensitivity. As a result, a cultural sensitivity application learning activity was implemented in PHRM 545L and assessed in fall 2018, with resultant improvement in performance in ABOs 3.5.1 and 3.5.4. The SLOA Plan along with PCOA scores, NAPLEX and MPJE pass rates are considered together - 9 - in assessment of the curriculum and are evaluated annually with corresponding implementation of curricular changes as appropriate. Curriculum Oversight and Quality Assurance The curriculum is overseen by the Curriculum Committee with input from administrative lead ership. The Committee has members from both departments, student members , and preceptor representation (Appendix 10 R). An administrative assistant and instructional designer support the C ommittee and a ssist with curriculum mapping and data collection from ExamSoft . Each year the Curriculum Committee receives charges from the Senior Associate Dean (SrAD) relate d to specific accreditation standards, curricular improvements, student outcomes, and student requests (Appendix 10 S). A standard charge entails r eview ing curriculum maps to ensure adequate content coverage and elimination of unnecessary redundancy to ensure student achievement of course-lev el learning outcomes and programmatic ABOs . For example, the Curriculum Committee convened a task force in 2017 - 2018 to review curricula r content related to toxicology . As a result, curricular changes were implemented including increased time devoted to toxicology of sympathomimetics/parasympathomimetics and bioterrorism. In 2017, our faculty disagreed with the statement \"Curriculum is taught at a depth that supports understanding\" (AACP Faculty Survey question 34 ) more often than peer institutions (31.2% disagree/strongly disagree; Peers 9.5%). The CC and SrAD implemented faculty retreats bringing together faculty teaching like content from the different departments to enhance understanding of curricular integration and content depth. In 2019, just 6.1% of our faculty expressed disagreement in AACP Faculty surv ey question 34, indicating strong improvement in this area that now surpas ses our peers . The CC also reviews each course in the PharmD program at least once every 3 years through its course review process (Appendix 10 T) which ensures continuous quality improvement at the course level. Every course is evaluated for content depth and breadth , instructional methods, course sequencing , assessment methods (in conjunction with the Assessment Committee) and syllabus content . The outputs from the review process include quality improvement recommendations , a formal summary which is communicated to the course faculty and department chairs , and a response letter from the course -coordinator describing planned changes . Implementation of recommendations is expected for the next course cycle . To ensure consistency and mapping a syllabus template for all SOP courses, including experiential was developed ( Appendix 10 U). The Curriculum Committee works closely with the Assessment Committee during the course review process. Communication between the two co mmittee s is ensured by joint membership on both committees by 3 members and by exchange of meeting minutes. In addition, reports from the Assessment Committee and Experiential Education committee are standing items on the Curriculum Committee's agenda. The C urriculum Committee Chair reports quality improvements and necessary changes during SOP faculty meetings and CC updates are agenda items at both departments' monthly meetings . Notable - 10 - Nine SOP faculty are enrolled or have completed the National Science Foundation -sponsored teaching program, Gateways . In addition, SOP faculty have published 30 peer -reviewed publications related to pedagogy since our last accreditation in 2012. 4) College or School's Final Self -Evaluation: Self -assess how well the program is in compliance with the standard by putting a check in the appropriate box : Standard 10: Compliant Compliant with Monitoring Partially Compliant Non Compliant No factors exist that compromise current compliance; no factors exist that, if not addressed, may compromise future compliance.

Evaluation procedures & criteria are clear; block taught courses indicate 70% min pass for each block . Grammar & spelling are appropriate. Comments: The syllabus format needs to be revised. Suggestions for improvement: Student Learning Objectives The objectives of the course are clear. Course content mirrored all of the stated objectives. The relationship between the course student learning objectives and the stated Ability- Based Outcomes is apparent. Comments: Some of the course objectives require clarification or re- wording. Content is missing for some of the objectives. Only some of the stated Ability-Based Outcomes correlate with the course. Suggestions for improvement: Instructional Methods The course was well organized and taught at an appropriate level for a student in the professional Pharm.D. program. The course challenges students to think critically and solve problems. A variety of active learning techniques were used to engage students. Technology (eg iPad, PRS, Apps) is used when appropriate to support student learning. Students are given a variety of opportunities to engage with the content. Comments: Student Learning Resources Student learning is supported by a variety relevant and current books, journal articles, DVD's, printed notes, &/or websites and are easily accessible to students. Lecture notes/slides are posted as PDFs in a timely fashion, clear, well organized, allow room for students to write, free of spelling &/or grammar errors. PPT slides for student note taking are on white background, in PDF format, 1 slide per page, and file named by TOPIC rather than CLASS. Instructor uses Tegrity lecture capture to support student learning. Comments: Some things could be changed regarding resources available to assist student learning. Suggestions for improvement: Evaluating Student Achievement Assessments are linked to course objectives and course content. The number and frequency of assessments is appropriate.

Responses to information requests from healthcare providers should be clear, succinct, and accu rate taking into account primary, secondary and tertiary literature. Students should work with their preceptor to identify at least one drug information request from a healthcare provider to respond to during their experience. The drug information reques t response should be \u00bd page typed, single spaced, excluding references. References should be documented using biomedical style/Chicago style (as used in PHRM 480: Drug Literature Evaluation). A copy of the student's completed drug information request mus t be provided to and discussed with their preceptor. Preceptors will evaluate the quality of the student's drug information responses in the final evaluation using the following evaluation question: Retrieve and analyze scientific literature to answer a dr ug information request. The Drug Information Request Assignment will be uploaded E*Value under Learning Modules/ Coursework. Current Event Topic Due: IPPE Week Four Rotation One: June 14, 2019 at 11:59 p.m. Rotation Two: July 12, 2019 at 11:59 p.m. This assignment should be completed by the end of the fourth week and reviewed with preceptor. Pharmacists are commonly asked about recent medication or health related topics that have been discussed in the news or written about in newspapers, magazines, etc. It is important for pharmacists to be knowledgeable about current events relating to healthcare. This knowledge and ability to discuss current events with patients helps to build and maintain the trust and confidence patients have in their pharmacist. In this assignment, students will need to research on their own a current event related to pharmacy practice recently talked about in the media. The student should state the nature of the current event, source it is taken from, a nd discuss the impact of this topic in patient care and/or community pharmacy practice. The student will be expected to discuss his/her findings with their preceptor. The preceptor does not evaluate the student performance of this activity. The student will reflect on what he/she learned in the reflection graded by faculty at the college. Case Logs Due: IPPE Week One, Two, Three and Four This assignment should be completed each week and your progress should be reviewed with your preceptor weekly by providing your preceptor with a weekly case log report to view. At the end of the rotation, your preceptor will respond to an evaluation question inquiring if this process was completed . Each week the report should begin from the start date of your rotation so that you can see your progress from week to week. The last report for week four should be from the first day of your rotation until the last day of your rotation. The following assignments will be logged using case logs in aggregate over the four weeks : 4 patient interviews, 40 prescription consultations, 10 non-prescription consultations, and four interprofessional healthcare provider interactions. Patient Interview s Students will be expected to interview at least four patient about their medication use during their IPPE experience. These interviews are defined to be meaningful patient encounters and may occur surrounding self - care recommendations, medication therapy m anagement, and/or pick up of new and refilled prescriptions. Please refer to resources posted in Blackboard for specific examples that would qualify for the patient interview requirement. Students will log their Patient Interviews in E*Value in Case Log s. Patient Consultations (Prescription) Students will be expected to provide at least 40 prescription consultations during their IPPE experience. Students will log these consultations in E*Value in Case Logs. Patient Consultation (Non -Prescription) Students will be expected to provide at least 10 non-prescription consultations during their IPPE experiences. Students will log these consultations in E*Value in Case Logs. Interprofessional Healthcare Provider Communication Students will be expected to interact with other healthcare providers using written and/or verbal communication at least four times during their IPPE experiences. Students will log these interactions in E*Value in Case Logs. Additional directions for how to log these ass ignments in Case Logs , including step by step screenshots, will be uploaded into Blackboard prior to the start of IPPE rotations for your review.

Scaled scores range from 0 to 700 and can be compared across test administrations. Scaled scores can also be compared between the major content areas, such that a student scoring 200 on Pharmaceutical Sciences and 250 on Basic Sciences demonstrated greater proficiency in Basic Sciences than Pharmaceutical Sciences Normed Reference Group: The normed reference group consists of a large, national, diverse group of students from United States colleges/schools of pharmacy. Based on data from 2017 through 2018, the norm group consists of approximately 19,271 students that collectively generalize to the population of pharmacy students. The use of reference groups in score reporting permits meaningful comparisons between the performances of current examinees to the performance of a national representative group. Percentile for Program Year: The percentile rank indicates the standing of NDSU's average student in the normed reference group. For example, if the school's percentile rank for third-year students is 60, this implies that the average third-year student at NDSU performed equally or better than 60% of all other third-year students in the normed reference group.NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY (n) 2016\u00b1 (81) 2017 (89) 2018 (64) 2019 (88) Total Number of Students\u00b6 13,602 6,516 7,821 7,198 Total Scaled Score Mean Scaled Score 369 355 366 360 National/Reference Group Scaled Score 358 354 352 348 Percentile for Program Year 56 51 61 60 Basic Biomedical Sciences Mean Scaled Score 342 365 349 348 National/Reference Group Scaled Score 348 358 353 349 Percentile for Program Year 47 52 51 52 Pharmaceutical Sciences Mean Scaled Score 365 343 356 346 National/Reference Group Scaled Score 357 356 354 349 Percentile for Program Year 54 43 50 48 Social/Behavioral/Administrative Pharmacy Sciences Mean Scaled Score 396 377 391 380 National/Reference Group Scale Score 358 361 356 350 Percentile for Program Year 67 63 71 70 Clinical Sciences Mean Scaled Score 376 357 370 369 National/ Reference Group Scale Score 368 351 352 348 Percentile for Program Year 54 55 63 64 APPENDIX 10 G PCOA School Score Means - Trends for Third Year Students 2016 -2020 School Subtopic Mean Percent Correct 2016 - 2020 Subtopics 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 # items NDSU (Nat'l) # items NDSU # items NDSU # items NDSU # items NDSU Basic Biomedical Sciences 32 10 20 20 20 Physiology (10) 58 (66) (6) 78 (6) 75 (6) 70 51 Biochemistry (8-9) 41 (47) (8) 50 (8) 54 (8) 51 69 Microbiology Related to Human Disease (4-5) 57 (63) (2) 69 (2) 63 (2) 69 Molecular Cell Biology/Genetics (4-5) 53 (60) Immunology (4) 40 (53) (4) 63 (4) 59 (4) 64 Pharmaceutical Sciences 60 66 66 66 Medicinal Chemistry (11-12) 48 (51) (15) 42 (15) 39 (15) 42 60 Pharmacology & Toxicology (15-16) 63 (59) (17) 62 (17) 61 (17) 60 Pharmacognosy & Dietary Supplements (2) 81 (76) (2) 74 (2) 82 (2) 78 Pharmaceutics/Biopharmaceutics (13-14) 67 (57) (12) 53 (12) 63 (12) 55 Pharmacokinetics (9-10) 49 (55) (8) 57 (8) 59 (8) 66 Pharmacogenomics and Genetics (0-1) 67 (54) (6) 62 (6) 60 (6) 58 Sterile and Nonsterile Compounding (7) 69 (59) (6) 68 (6) 83 (6) 69 Social/Behavioral/Admin Pharmacy Sciences 44 44 44 44 Healthcare & Public Health Delivery Systems (7) 71 (68) (6) 65 (6) 74 (6) 62 Population-Based Care & Pharmacoepidemiology (1) 77 (79) (3) 83 (3) 78 (3) 75 Economic & Humanistic Outcomes of HC Delivery (3-4) 72 (62) (2) 77 (2) 55 (2) 65 Pharmacy Management (6) 60 (66) (6) 70 (6) 73 (6) 76 Pharmacy Law & Regulatory Affairs (5) 88 (73) (5) 72 (5) 77 (5) 70 Biostatistics & Research Design (5) 64 (66) (3) 87 (3) 73 (3) 83 Ethical Decision Making (1-2) 65 (77) (3) 81 (3) 87 (3) 88 Professional Com munication (6) 74 (83) (7) 81 (7) 74 (7) 75 Social & Be havioral Aspects in Practice (2) 90 (78) (3) 81 (3) 80 (3) 88 Medication Dis pensing & Distribution Systems (6-7) 74 (71) (6) 65 (6) 86 (6) 76 Clinical Sciences 64 70 70 70 Evidence- based Practice (7-8) 59 (71) (10) 58 (10) 58 (10) 70 Clinical Pathophysiology (19) 64 (64) (8) 49 (8) 57 (8) 59 Clinical P harmacokinetics (5-6) 61 (64) (5) 56 (5) 64 (5) 65 Clinical Pharmacogenomics (2) 67 (2) 42 (2) 58 Disease Prevention and Population Health (5) 78 (73) (4) 73 (4) 68 (4) 66 Patient Assessment (9) 72 (9) 70 (9) 68 Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (21) 79 (74) (32) 65 (32) 70 (32) 64 APPENDIX 10 HLast Name First Name Department Credentials Courses Taught 2018-2019 Expertise Amrita PSCI of PK and based drug delivery systems, Oral delivery of biologics, Nanoparticle based formulation development, Ionic liquid based formulations, Pharmaceutics and pharmacokinetics Brooks Amanda PSCI Ph.D., Molecular Biology, B.S., Biology, Genetic Engineering EmphasisPSCI 367 Pharmaceutical Calculations (Course Coordinator), PSCI 410/610 Pharmaceutical BiotechnologyAntibiotic drug resistance,hemocompatible, antimicrobial biomaterial surface coating, advanced drug delivery.

Faculty may assess in a different format from the original exam (e.g. multiple choice may be replaced with essay questions). d.All delayed or makeup examinations must be taken under direct observation of a proctor. The proctor may be a teaching assistant, graduate assistant. The proctor may also directly observe with use of a surveillance camera. 3.Students must be on time for examinations. Students arriving more than 15 minutes late, without proper justification, will be subject to penalty. Student\u0092s arrivi ng late must take the examination in a location determined by the individual administering the exam. Unless extenuating circumstances are cause for the delay and were unavoidable, they will receive no additional time. 4.Examination start times will not be delayed due to a hardware or software problem with aAPPENDIX 10Nstudent\u0092s iPad. Students enc ountering a technical issue during an exam should notify the individual administering the exam. See Technology Issues. 5. Students are responsible for bringing their iPad to the examination room with the exam file already downloaded. Additional time will not be granted for downloading exam files when it was available prior to the exam session. 6.

Students should avoid behaviors that give the appearance of cheating (e.g. talking during exams, wandering eyes) and should take measures to protect their own work. 3. Violations of the Conduct Standards will be reported to the Senior Associate Dean and reported via the Professional Misconduct tracking form. 4. Instructors may move students during the examination to avoid or suspend possible instances of cheating. If a widespread breach of the Conduct Standards is suspected, particularly in the case of emergency matters/evacuation, the instructor may cancel the remainder of the examination and reschedule a new exam at a later date (NDSU Policy Manual Section 335). VI. Interruptions During an Examination 1. If a fire alarm or other emergency condition occurs during an examination, either paper or electronic-based, students will immediately cease taking the examination and evacuate the building.

The College has established professionalism and ethics as two of its core values. Pharmacists, nurses, allied heal th care professionals, public h ealth professionals, and pharmaceutical scientists must live up to the high ideals of their profession. Their lives must be guided by the principles of honesty and integrity, in order to ensure that the public can regard their words and actions as unquestionably trustworthy. To develop an understanding of and respect for these principles of honesty and integrity as applied to the academic work of pharmacy, nursing, allied science, and public health student s, the College of Health Professions has developed this student conduct policy. This policy is applicable to anyone enrolled as a student in the College, including those in the pre- professional, professional, and gr aduate programs. This policy also applies to any student taking a course for credit in the College. Acceptance of this policy is required as a condition o f admission to the College. Academic Standards The academic standards of the College of Health Professions dif fer from those of the University. Any student who fails to meet or exceed the University standards may be placed on Univer sity probation or suspension (see the current NDSU Bulletin for university information on academic deficiencies). Semester Grade Point Average (All Students): To be in good academic standing within the College, all undergraduate and professional students shall maintain a semest er grade point average of 2.00 or above for each semester enrolled in the College of Health Professions. All graduate students are expected to maintain a 3.0 grade point average as well as any other academic policies outlined b y the graduate school. Any student who fails to attain a semester GPA of 2.0 or above may be placed on College probation. Students who have been placed on academic pr obation for two (2) consecutive or three (3) non-consecutiv e semesters shall be suspended from enrollment in the College. After two suspensions, student s will be terminated from the College. (Termination from the College does not prohibit the student from registering elsewhere in the University provided the academic standards of the alternate college of registration hav e been met or exceeded.) A student who is suspended and desires readmission into the Col lege must file a request for re-admittance with the Senior Associate Dean at least 60 days prior to the beginning of the semester in which readmission is sought. In addition, professional students must seek readmission to the professional programs in Pharmacy, Nursing, Allied Sciences, and Public Health through the Admissio ns Committee of their respect ive program. Minimum Grade Requirement (Professional Students): To be in good academic standing within the College, all students enrolled in the professi onal programs of the College must complete all required courses within the College with a grade of \"C\" or above. S tudents are encouraged to refer to program-specific policies related to minimum grade requirements which can be found in the College Policy Manual at www.ndsu.edu/healthprofessions/college_information /policy_manual/ . Graduate students are expected to uphold policies and procedu res consistent with the graduate school and to maintain a 3.0 grade point average. Students Enrolled in College Aff iliated Educational Training Pr ograms (Professional Students): To be in good academic standing within the College, all students enrolled in College affiliated internships, clinical, or experiential training programs are also required to uphold the academic stan dards of that affiliate and will be subject to the terms of probation, suspension, and ter mination of the affiliated progra m. Students failing to meet affiliated program academic standards may also lead to termination from the College.

Hence, the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development has the initial and primary res ponsibility for administering and enforcing professional misc onduct issues. 2. The Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Developme nt will work collaboratively with the Department Chair (and where appropriate, i ndividual instructors) to resolv e professional misconduct issues. Department and College Related Sanctions Additional academic and/or professional disciplinary sanctions for the department/program may be assigned by the Department Chair depending upon the circumstances and nature of the misconduct. The Department Administrator will notify the student in writing of the sanction and rights to due process and forward a copy to the Senior Associate Dean &/or Associate Dean for Student Affa irs and Faculty Development. The Senior Associate Dean may impose additional disciplinary sa nctions for the College and will notify the student in writing and the Dean of the College of Graduate and Interdisciplinary S tudies (if a graduate student involved). Disciplinary action for academic and professional misconduct will depend based upon the seriousness of the miscon duct. In general, sanctions may include, but are not lim ited to, any of the following: 1. Probation. 2. Supervised probation. 3. Suspension from the College. 4. Termination from the College. (Termination from the College of Health Professions does not prohibit the student from registering elsewhere in the Univ ersity provided the academic s tandards of the alternate college of registration have been met or exceeded.) In cases of particularly egregiou s or multiple instances of aca demic/professional misconduct, the Dean of the College may also recommend expulsion from the university. Student's Right to Appeal Students sanctioned for violations of the College Student Acade mic and Conduct Standards Policy have the right to appeal. Student appeals must follow the appeal procedure outlined below . Graduate student appeals of sanctions involving academic misconduct must be filed in accordance with the Gradua te Student Appeals policy described in the NDSU Graduate Bulletin. Pre-professional/Professional Student Appeals Procedure 1. If the student chooses to appeal a course instructor's sanct ion, it must be pursued in the following sequence: course instructor, Department Chair, Associate Dean for Student Affair s and Faculty Development or Senior Associate Dean, and Dean. 2. Department and College related sanctions for professional mi sconduct may be appealed to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Deve lopment and the College Student Affairs Committee. Department and College related sanctions for academic misconduct may be appealed to the Senior Associate Dean and the College Academic Affairs Committee. Final appeals may be made to the Dean of the Colleg e of Health Professions. 3. In cases of sanctions involving suspension or termination fr om the College of Health Professions, the appeal will follow the process outlined in Univers ity Policy 335: Code of Academic Responsibility and Conduct. 4. An appeal for any sanction must be made in writing within 15 business days of the sanction letter. The date of the letter shall be the date the letter is postmarked. I f hand-delivered, a notation of that date will be made in the student's file. 5. Appeal letters must specify i n detail one or more of the fol lowing bases of appeal: a. the sanction was too severe for the offense; b. the decision for non-action/ac tion/sanction was made in an a rbitrary or capricious manner; c. the finding of the Student Academic and Conduct Standards Policy having been violated was not substanti ated by evidence, and/or d. the student's/student organizati on's rights were violated (spec ify those rights believed to have been violated). Appeal Review Process (Pre-professional and Professional Studen ts) 1. Appeals made to the Senior Associate Dean or Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development will be reviewed by the Academic Affairs Committee or Student Affairs C ommittee of the College depending upon the conduct violation in question. 2. The Academic Affairs/Student Affairs Committee will review t he written letter of appeal from the student/organization and the materials from the origin al adjudication process. After reviewing these materials, the committee may decide to do one of the following: a. issue a decision based solely on the written materials; b. issue a decision based on a r eview of written materials and discussion with the involved principals; c. recall one or more witnesses; d. refer the decision to the full faculty for action; e. return the case for reconsid eration of the decision and/or s anctions. 3. The Academic Affairs/Student Affairs Committee may uphold or lessen the original decision/sanction but not increase the sanctions/actions imposed by other persons or bodies. 4. The decision of the committee will generally be issued withi n 15 working days of the receipt of the appeal letter, but may take longer during Universi ty recesses, or in the event of complex cases. 5. The Registrar w ill be advised of the re sults of the appeal. Unresolved Appeals After the College appeals process has been completed, if the st udent/organization is not satisfied with the appeal decision, the student/organization has the right to appeal the decision t o the Provost. The Provost will ma ke the final decision on any appeals. Incomplete Disciplinary Process Students with pending disciplinary or legal actions, with sanct ions for which an appeal has been submitted but not resolved, or whose sanctions have not been successfully fulfilled, will n ot be allowed to graduate from NDSU with a degree, major, or program of study offered by the College of Health Profession s. In such cases, the College reserves the right to place a hold on a student's graduation unt il the case has been successf ully resolved and the sanctions have been successfully fulfilled.
