It was prepared by Tracey Burns and Francesca Gottschalk. Sophie Limoges was responsible for the design and providing editorial support.FOREWORD We are more connected than ever before. Many children have access to tablets and smartphones before they learn to walk and talk. This begs the questi on: What are the impacts of technology on children, and how can screens impact their growth and development? This is an area where there is an urgent need for robust research to guide policy and practi ce. Shock headlines such as \"Have Smartphones Destroyed a Generati on?\" and claims that technology is \"re-wiring\" children's brains are dramati c, but to what extent do they refl ect what we actually know rather than anxieti es with tools we do not yet understand? This brochure brings together research from the OECD's 21st Century Children project to summarise some of the guidelines that have been established for children's use of screens. It also provides an overview of the research on the impact of using technologies - including television, video games and social media - on children's developing brains and bodies. Lastly, it looks at the role of schools and teachers in supporti ng and guiding safe and responsible technology use. People tend to be scared, or at least wary, of new developments in technology. Yet we live in an age where digital tools have fundamentally transformed the world, and the reality of children's lives. We owe it to our children and youth to separate fact from cti on, and help support them to get the best start in life. Andreas Schleicher Director, Educati on and Skills, OECD 1 \u00a9 OECD 20192 \u00a9 OECD 2019 T echnology trends in the 21st century We are more connected than ever. At the end of 2017, the number of high-speed mobile subscripti ons in OECD countries reached a milestone: more subscripti ons than the number of people (OECD, 2019). And young people are parti cularly acti ve on line. In 2015, a typical 15-year-old reported using the Internet since the age of 10 and spending more than two hours every weekday on line aft er school (an increase of over 40 minutes since 2012), and more than three hours every weekend day (OECD, 2017).Not only are youth using the Internet more, they are doing so at younger ages (Hooft -Graafl and, 2018). Some research suggests that preschoolers become familiar with digital devices before they are exposed to books (Hopkins, Brookes and Green, 2013). In the United Kingdom, the most recent gures show that 52% of 3-4 year-olds and 82% of 5-7 year- olds are on line (Ofcom, 2019). Figure 1. Snapshot of children's media use in the UK Source: adapted from Ofcom, 20193 \u00a9 OECD 2019WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT CHILDREN AND TECHNOLOGY? Over-concerned about being \"over-connected\"? The rise in children's use of technology has led to growing concern about how it a ects children's brains, bodies and their socio-emoti onal, cogniti ve and physical development. Many groups concerned with children's health, including governments and medical societi es, advocate for parti ally or fully limiti ng screen ti me for children. However, \"restricti on focused\" guidelines are criti cised by experts in the eld as not being based on robust research. Currently, scienti c research: is not conclusive enough to support evidence-based guidelines on optimal amounts of screen use or online acti viti es (Gott schalk, 2019); and does not a causal relati onship between screen-based acti viti es and mental although some associati ons between screen-based acti viti es and anxiety or depression have been found (OECD, 2018, Orben and Przybylski, 2019). However, it is sti ll wise to take a precauti onary approach including turning o devices when not in use, switching o screens an hour before bed, and designati ng ti mes (e.g. while having dinner or driving) and locati ons (e.g. the bedroom) as media-free. Most importantly, it is key to maintain a focus on the acti viti es that are strongly associated with healthy development, such as good quality, regular sleep and quality ti me spent with family and friends. These and many other factors are more important than taking a hard line over screen ti me limits to ensure the best start in life. Evidence-based guidelines: an example of good practi ce from the United Kingdom The UK Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health Recommendati ons are based on a comprehensive review of the evidence on the e ects of screen ti me on children's physical and mental health. Given the lack of causal evidence linking screen ti me to negati ve child health, the guidelines focus on aspects of child well-being, such as online safety (i.e. from bullying, exploitati on etc.) and access to inappropriate content. The main recommendati on is that families negoti ate screen ti me with children, based on the needs of the child and on which screens are in use and how they may or may not displace other health-related behaviours or social acti viti es. The guide poses four questi ons to be used by families to examine how they use screens. If families are sati s ed with their responses, it is likely they are doing well regarding screen ti me. The questi ons are: 1. Is screen ti me in your household controlled?2. Does screen use interfere with what your family wants to do?3. Does screen use interfere with sleep?4. Are you able to control snacking during screen ti me?The guide nishes with a set of recommendati ons on how families can reduce screen ti me, if they feel the need. This includes protecti ng sleep, prioriti sing face-to-face interacti on and being aware of parents' media use, as children tend to learn by example.

This may be signi cant because childhood is a ti me of rapid growth, development and maturati on. One important element of the human brain is that it is \"plasti c\", which means that it changes in response to experiences. Childhood is a period of high brain plasti city. During the rst three years of life, a child's brain may create over one million new connecti ons per second - essenti al for the development of hearing, language and cogniti on (Center on the Developing Child, 2009). These basic capaciti es create the foundati on for the neural networks underlying more complex acti viti es, such as decision-making and cognitive flexibility. Brain imaging studies have shown that these changes in functi on are accompanied by extensive structural alterati ons in the adolescent brain (Crone and Konijn, 2018). \"Rewiring\" children's brains takes a litt le more than some screen ti me Due to the plasti city in childhood, there is a lot of concern about technology \"rewiring\" children's brains. Unfortunately, there is an abundance of misinformati on on this topic that has fed into fears and misplaced anxiety about how and how much children use technology. A quick google search shows how fearful people are of screens Fortunately, major brain changes and \"rewiring\" resulti ng from screen ti me is unlikely (Mills, 2014). Children's outcomes are the product of many di erent factors, including their experiences and environment (along with other factors such as geneti cs). While technology will have an impact on them, the key is to maximise the cogniti ve, physical and social bene ts it brings while minimising the risks. 5 \u00a9 OECD 2019Impacts of technology on children The impact of technology depends on the type of technology and what it is used for (Bavelier, Green and Dye, 2010). It is thus important to bett er understand how and why technology is used, and the variety of devices children choose. Young people use the Internet for gaming, chatti ng and social networking. Although televisions and tablets dominate media use in children, traditi onal television is increasingly being replaced by services such as Netf lix and Amazon Prime, and YouTube is quickly becoming the viewing platf orm of choice especially for 8-11 year-olds (Ofcom, 2019 ). Children may use computers during class ti me, cell phones to keep in contact with friends, a tablet to do schoolwork in the evening, and then watch an hour of television with their families to unwind. This can add up to many hours over the course of the day, although the majority of 12-15s in the United Kingdom believe they have managed to strike a balance between using screens and doing other things (Ofcom, 2019). Spotlight on the \"Goldilocks e ect\" Is there a \"right\" amount of technology use? The \"Goldilocks E ect\" argues that moderate engagement in online and digital acti viti es is bene cial in terms of subjecti ve mental well-being and adolescent connectedness, whereas too much or too litt le might prove detrimental (Przybylski and Weinstein, 2017). So how much is too much? The threshold varies and will depend on the individual acti vity and child. In 2015, 16% of 15 year-olds among OECD countries reported that they spent more than 6 hours on line per day outside school during weekdays, and 26% during weekends. These \"extreme Internet users\" reported less life sati sfacti on and were more likely to be bullied at school (OECD, 2017). Moreover, \"extreme Internet users\" performed worse across all subjects in the Programme for Internati onal Student Assessment (PISA), even aft er accounti ng for di erences in socio-economic background. Note: Screen use of computers shown. The patt ern is consistent also for watching TV, gaming and streaming.

Source: OECD, PISA 2015 Database, Table III.13.23.WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT CHILDREN AND TECHNOLOGY? 7 \u00a9 OECD 2019Television There is a larger research base on television and children than most other types of technology; in part, this is because television has been around for a long ti me. However the research is contradictory and there is no clear impact (either positi ve or negati ve) of moderate television viewing (Foster and Watkins, 2010). The two most important elements appear to be the quality of the programming, and whether or not the child is interpreti ng it with a parent or other responsible viewer. A systemati c review of the literature exploring the associati on between television viewing and outcomes such as academic performance, language and play suggests that watching high-quality content is associated with higher academic skills and is predicti ve of future academic performance, whereas watching television during infancy and engaging with inappropriate content was associated with negati ve outcomes (Kostyrka-Allchorne, Cooper and Simpson, 2017). These findings underline the concern about equity and context as children from disadvantaged backgrounds tend to watch more television than children from advantaged backgrounds (Certain and Kahn, 2002; Rideout and Hamel, 2006). In sum, there may be some bene ts associated with engaging with child-tailored, educati onal content in terms of improved verbal abiliti es, cogniti ve development and neural maturity in children. However, the research also points to children learning bett er from live sources than from videos, despite the potential mitigation of this deficit by using socially meaningful or familiar onscreen characters. The importance of co-viewing \"Co-viewing\" (when parents watch videos with children) allows children to potenti ally increase their ability to learn from video content (see Gott schalk, 2019, for an overview). When parents pose questi ons and give descripti ons and labels during viewing, this helps their children pay more att enti on (Barr et al., 2008). But the extent of the cogniti ve outcomes associated with co-viewing is unclear and it might also be that simply engaging in behaviours (screen-based or not) with a caregiver may be bene cial for child development (Lee, Spence and Carson, 2017). A warning: Co-viewing may inadvertently be increasing the divide between advantaged and disadvantaged families. Children whose parents are able to spend ti me curati ng and mentoring screen ti me may reap more bene ts than those in families with less nancial resources and with parents who are less able to be involved in daily acti viti es (Canadian Paediatric Society, 2017). It is thus important to encourage all parents to talk to their children about what they are watching. For children with parents whose schedule gives them less ti me to spend together, co-viewing perhaps can be incorporated into other health and development-promoti ng habits, even for infants and young children. Highlights of Research on...WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT CHILDREN AND TECHNOLOGY? 8 \u00a9 OECD 2019Video games The literature on video gaming and children is much more recent than that on television. The majority of the research that exists focuses on negati ve rather than positi ve outcomes (Granic, Lobel and Engels, 2013). Providing a coherent and balanced evidence base is important, especially as online gaming is becoming increasingly popular; of children aged 5-15 in the United Kingdom who play games, three quarters do so on line (Ofcom, 2019).Parents and educators oft en worry about the impact of gaming on educati onal att have positi ve e ects on children. In general, however, there is a lack of strong evidence and the literature in this domain is contradictory. Acti ve video games Video games have undergone a shift . Where we once had only sedentary, controller-based games, we now have opti ons to engage in acti ve video games, which require players to engage in physical movements in order to interact with the screen-based game and can elicit light, or even moderate acti vity (Norris, Hamer and Stamatakis, 2016). Augmented reality games, or those that involve geotracking (or in the case of Pok\u00e9mon GO, a game that uses both) are also becoming increasingly popular and are argued to promote movement. However, the evidence on whether these can be used to enhance physical tness or promote well-being is mixed. A systemati c review of the literature on acti ve video games as health interventi ons within schools found that the research was not of a high enough quality, and recommended that randomised controlled trials with larger sample sizes be conducted in order for these to be used as health interventi ons (Norris, Hamer and Stamatakis, 2016). In contrast, a meta-analysis including 35 arti cles on acti ve video games concluded that these games can be a good alternati ve to sedentary behaviour, although they are not replacements for more traditi onal sports and physical acti vity in children and adolescents. The e ect sizes (i.e. the size of the di erence in outcomes between those who played the video games and those who did not) in most of these studies ranged from small to null (Gao et al., 2015). This highlights an important problem in this eld; e ect sizes are oft en small or even negligible. Source: Gott schalk, 2019 Social media & communicati on Since 1997, over 10 000 published journal arti cles have used the term \"social media\", with experts in elds such as psychology, economics and sociology incorporati ng this topic into their research agendas (Meshi, Tamir and Heekeren, 2015). This is for a good reason: in the UK about 70% of kids aged 12-15 have a social media pro le (Ofcom, 2019). In the US approximately 97% of 13-17 year-olds use at least one social media platf orm (Ancerson and Jiang, 2018) Similar to the \"Goldilocks Hypothesis\" for screen use, there is evidence to suggest that children's social relati onships can be sti mulated through digital technology and that moderate online communicati on has a positi ve relati onship with the quality of friendship and social capital (for a review, see (Kardefelt-Winther, 2017)).Despite the proliferati on of research exploring social media use and the huge numbers of children subscribing to these platforms, empirical research on the impacts of social media on the brain is scarce. In 2015, only seven published arti cles explored neurosciences and social media (Meshi, Tamir and Heekeren, 2015). Furthermore, most studies focus on Facebook use, which is not as popular as other social media used by 21st-century children, such as Snapchat and Instagram.Despite the di culty in conducti ng research on rapidly changing technology, it is important to study this further. Internalising behaviours such as anxiety and depression have risen in recent years in children and adolescents (Choi, 2018); social media oft en takes the blame for being one of the root causes of this trend. Being connected to their online communiti es is important for children and adolescents. Half of the students who took the 2015 PISA assessment agreed with the statement \"I feel bad when I am not on line\". In European countries, disadvantaged students were more likely to report that they felt bad without available Internet connecti on, compared to advantaged students, and girls were more likely to report feeling bad when unconnected than boys (OECD, 2017). There is some research to suggest that social media use, especially at night, might be linked to outcomes such as poor sleep quality. But relati onships between screen use and levels of anxiety and depression tend to be small, and do not show the directi on of the link (that is, levels of anxiety and depression could be causing more social media use, or vice versa) (OECD, 2018).WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT CHILDREN AND TECHNOLOGY? 9 \u00a9 OECD 2019% 90 8070 3 -5 -8 4 -6 11 -3Chinese Taipei Sweden France Portugal Greece Singapore Thailand Macao (China) Brazil Spain United Kingdom Bulgaria Hong Kong (China) Korea Belgium Denmark Croatia Israel New Zealand Netherlands Uruguay Hungary Australia OECD average Dominican Republic Ireland Poland Costa Rica Lithuania Japan Mexico Russia Czech Republic Italy Peru Colombia Finland Chile Latvia Slovak Republic B-S-J-G (China) Switzerland Austria Luxembourg Iceland Germany Estonia SloveniaGirls feeling bad if not connected Boys feeling bad if not connectedFigure 3.

Controversial diagnoses: Social media, gaming and \"addicti on\" Policymakers, parents and the media are consistently reporti ng concerns about gaming and addicti on. \"Internet Gaming Disorder\" (IGD) was recently included in the Appendix of the Diagnosti c and Stati sti cal Manual of Mental Disorders-V (DSM-V) and as \"Gaming disorder\" in the draft of the 11th revision of the World Health Organizati on's Internati onal Classi cati on al., and the formal classi cati on as a \"disorder\" is contenti ous in the scienti c community (Turel et al., 2014). Some researchers prefer to use terms such as 'excessive Internet use' to avoid using medical classi cati on terminology et al., 2012, Kardefelt-Winther, 2017). \"Problemati c\" or \"excessive\" use of technology is determined by whether the use interferes with normal daily functi ons and is di cult to control, rather than based on the absolute quanti ty of exposure (Howard-Jones, 2011). \"Facebook addicti on\" is another term that has gained tracti on in recent years, and as with \"gaming addicti on\" this label is contenti ous. Even though more children are using social media than ever before, research on the e ects of that acti vity on developing brains is sti ll in its infancy. The use of social media has been connected to facial recogniti on and memory, which could prove bene cial in establishing and maintaining strong social networks both on line and o , in adolescence and later in life. However, directi onal causality cannot be inferred, and oft en the functi onal relevance of certain brain phenomena is unclear. As this is a fast-moving area, the importance of using rigorous research is more necessary than ever (OECD, 2018 ). At present, there appears to be a disconnect between the available evidence, media and public percepti on. Claims that \"smartphones have ruined a generati on\" are largely unfounded. However, it is clear that this is an area of study that will need constant updati ng and re nement as technology evolves.WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT CHILDREN AND TECHNOLOGY?10 \u00a9 OECD 2019Implicati ons for physical health: frequently asked questi ons Does screen ti me impact children's sleep? Many devices today emit short wavelength or blue light, which has an e ect on natural sleep and wake cycles. As computers, cell phones and tablets have evolved over ti me to have larger and brighter screens, using one of these self-luminous devices in the evening has been associated with reduced melatonin, a hormone that helps signal sleep to the body. A systemati c review of the literature examining sleep patt erns among school-aged children and adolescents found that the vast majority of the studies showed negati ve associati ons between screen ti me and sleep outcomes, such as delayed ti ming and shortened durati on of sleep (Hale and Guan, 2015), although this reducti on might be as small as 3-8 minutes per hour devoted to screen ti me (Przybylski, 2019). However, associati on, or correlati on, does not imply causality, and it is hard to accurately measure sleep and screen ti me. Sti ll, it seems clear that establishing limits on when children and adolescents use technology (e.g. not in the hours immediately preceding bedti me), or providing children with protecti ve equipment, such as blue light-blocking glasses, may help prevent sleep disrupti ons. More research is needed to identi fy whether acti vati ng features on mobile devices, such as \"night shift \" or \"night mode\", are e ecti ve in avoiding disrupti on of melatonin producti on. These steps could be incorporated into good sleep-hygiene practi ces, which include avoiding excess (or any) ca eine, engaging in regular exercise, maintaining a regular sleep schedule, and eliminati ng light and noise from the sleeping environment (Stepanski and Wyatt , 2003). What's the link between obesity and screens? Over recent decades, increases in time spent watching television and using the computer have raised concerns about obesity in children. Eati ng while watching television, for example, has been associated with an increase in energy intake (i.e. more calories or food eaten) because it can delay the feeling of fullness. It can also obscure signals of sati ety from foods that have been previously consumed (i.e. children do not stop eating, even though they are already full) (Bellissimo et al., 2007). This can be parti ally miti gated by parents and caregivers limiti ng snacks in the home, providing children with healthy foods to snack on while watching television or playing video games, and making meal ti mes screen-free. Isn't screen time taking time away from children socialising, playing and doing sports? Some literature points to the noti on of a \"displacement e ect\", whereby ti me spent using technology takes away from other potenti ally more \"valuable\" acti viti es (Neuman, 1988). However, a recent review of the literature suggests that reducing screen ti me may not moti vate adolescents and children to engage more in physical acti vity (Kardefelt- Winther, 2017); other research has behaviour and leisure-ti me physical acti vity are independent of one another (Gebremariam et al., 2013). Television watching may displace other acti viti es, such as reading, but the overall evidence of the negati ve impact of displacement is relati vely weak (Evans Schmidt and Anderson, 2009). While screens do not speci cally cause myopia (short- sightedness), too much ti me spent indoors is associated with its onset (Dolgin, 2015). Parents and teachers should thus ensure that screen ti me does not take away from ti me spent outdoors. Displacement e ects can di er based on the extent of screen ti me and the acti viti es being displaced. For example, heavy Internet use may interfere with parti cipati on in clubs and sports, whereas moderate use has been shown to encourage parti cipati on (Romer, Bagdasarov and More, 2013). This is a relati vely consistent nding across the research: moderate Internet use, and shared media experiences, allow young people to build rapport with their peers (Romer, Bagdasarov and More, 2013; Romer, Jamieson and Pasek, 2009). 11 \u00a9 OECD 2019What can schools do? The role of educati on in fostering safe, responsible Internet use Schools and educati on systems play a key role in supporti ng safe and responsible Internet use. The challenge for schools lies in their ability to reduce the negati ve uses of the Internet and digital devices while maintaining their contributi ons to teaching, learning and social connecti on. In order to do this, children should be taught how to manage risks on line. Schools and educati on systems can adopt some of the following approaches to support students in their digital use (for the full discussion see Hooft -Graafl and, 2018). Adopt a whole-school approach to resolving online safety issues When teachers and support sta can recognise, respond to and resolve online safety issues, this is e ecti ve in protecti ng and supporti ng students on line. Sta and teachers therefore need regular training in online risks and their implicati ons. Parents and students can be involved to strengthen their own capacity in dealing with online issues. And don't forget the connecti on to the physical world: online safety also means putti ng screens away while crossing roads and walking! Develop and enact online safety policies and procedures E ecti ve policies and procedures promote responsible and safe online practi ce for students and sta . Good policies will support students' online learning, without preventi ng or overly limiti ng online access, and should be integrated with safeguarding policies such as those on cyberbullying and online behaviour. Talking to children about their experiences and engaging them in the development of online safety policies is important, as children oft en know best what new risks they might encounter on line. Establish coherent (cyber)bullying policies Policies targeti ng cyberbullying should be incorporated into the context of traditi onal bullying. Given the strong correlati on between the two, successful bullying interventi ons may also reduce cyberbullying (Livingstone, Stoilova and Kelly, 2016). E ecti ve policies for bullying clearly describe what behaviour is and is not accepted on line and at school, and what the consequences are for violati ng these rules (StopBullying, 2017).Incorporate e-safety in the curriculum Including online safety in the school's curriculum helps children become safe and responsible users of technologies (Hinduja and Patchin, 2018), with peer-support programmes and mentoring schemes seen as e ecti ve in enhancing online safety. But e-safety is not isolated from the rest of learning. There is a growing belief that schools should teach digital citi zenship as part of digital literacy, to help children engage in more positi ve online behaviour. This includes online eti quett e and behaviour as well as on harm reducti on strategies that teach children about empathy and privacy (see Hooft- Graafl and, 2018). Strengthen family-school partnerships Online safety must conti nue at home. As younger children go on line and children increasingly use technology out of school environments, parents and caregivers play a more important role in educati ng children about technology (Duerager and Livingstone, 2012). Parents and caregivers thus need to know about adapti ve ways of responding to safety incidents with children, and how best they can e ecti vely mediate their child's exposure to online risks. Furthermore, technology can be an important tool in parent- teacher communication, informing parents about their children's ti me at school and including them in acti viti es and discussion. Harness the power of peers Besides seeking help from parents and teachers, children and especially adolescents turn to each other when they need support. They also learn about new opportuniti es on line mainly through their peers: Peer mediati on can positi vely a ect children's digital literacy and the type of acti viti es they engage in on line. It is thus important to foster an open culture of e-safety in schools so that peers can also provide helpful advice and access to resources. WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT CHILDREN AND TECHNOLOGY? 12 \u00a9 OECD 2019Making e-safety work Even though children oft en seem to understand technology bett er than adults do, they need guidance on how to use technology in a responsible and positi ve way. The following set of messages are important to consider when developing school policies: Adults who understand online safety and are able to use technology are more successful in guiding children's digital use. Therefore, it is crucial that parents and teachers receive informati on on online safety, and advice on how to help children manage online risks (Livingstone, Davidson and Bryce, 2017). Take a look in the mirror: teachers and parents need to be mindful of their own online behaviour and what they are modelling for the youth around them. Parents (and grandparents) should never assume that children are happy to have their images and news about their lives shared on line without their permission. Children and adolescents need to be stimulated to become content creators and not just receivers (Livingstone, Davidson and Bryce, 2017). Most students sti ll use the Internet for ready-made, mass-produced content, such as watching online video clips or listening to music. The second digital divide is real: students from more advantaged backgrounds tend to have higher digital skills. Special e orts should be made to overcome these inequaliti es and ensure that disadvantaged children receive the support and guidance they need to succeed in a digital world (Hatlevik, Gud\u00f0mundsd\u00f3tti r and Loi, 2015). One last note: Policy soluti ons should be based on robust evidence. The speed of change of technology means that research on the impact of technology on children is more, not less, important. Although seemingly self-evident, fears that technology is harmful for children have resulted in a disconnect between the policy, public discourse and the body of evidence. This topic will need constant updati ng and re nement as technology and its uses evolve. The OECD's Directorate for Science, Technology and Industry is currently revisiting and updating the OECD (2012), Recommendati on of the Council on the Protecti on of Children Online. The Recommendati on includes principles for all stakeholders involved in making the Internet a safer environment for children and educati ng them to become responsible digital citi zens. The conclusions of this process will be available in the coming months. 13 \u00a9 OECD 2019References Aarseth, E. et al.
