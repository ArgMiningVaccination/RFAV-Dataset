This case report provides first-time data on a possible delayed, cutaneous, adverse reaction in a breastfed, 16-month-old female infant after the first administration of the AstraZeneca vaccine to her 33-year-old mother. Even though, no clinical adverse effects were observed in the mother, her daughter had a 2-day rash in the lower extremities and face. The infant's cutaneous rashes might be a coincidental event. However, all skin lesions were analogous to previous descriptions and photographs of dermatologic reactions, which resolved spontaneously with no medical intervention, in people who had been vaccinated with other COVID-19 vaccines. Our aim is that this short report contributes to the enhancement of parental awareness about the possibility of similar skin rashes in breastfed children when the mothers receive a vaccination and the importance of reporting those adverse reactions to the competent authorities.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-04-13", "cleaned_text": "Delayed Cutaneous Adverse Reaction of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine in a Breastfed Female Infant: A Coincidence or a However, as a novel vaccine, there are still gaps in the knowledge. The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (Vaxzevria, AstraZeneca, Cambridge, UK) was developed at Oxford University and consists of a replication-deficient chimpanzee adenoviral vector ChAdOx1, which carries the SARS-CoV-2 structural surface glycoprotein antigen (spike protein; nCoV-19) gene that can enter the cells yet is unable to replicate [ [4](#B4-vaccines-10-00602)]. While the Pfizer-BioNTech (Comirnaty, BioNTech/Pfizer, BNT162b2, Mainz, Germany) and vaccines Cambridge, MA, USA) are messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines, the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine is an adenovirus vector vaccine [ [1](#B1-vaccines-10-00602), [4](#B4-vaccines-10-00602)]; it contains less ingredients when compared with mRNA vaccines, as shown in [Table 1](#vaccines-10-00602-t001), and requires two doses given four weeks apart [ [3](#B3-vaccines-10-00602)]. [2](#B2-vaccines-10-00602)]. All vaccines have been authorized under a so-called conditional approval scheme by the European Medicine Agency (EMA) while awaiting further evidence. The World Health Organization (WHO) advised that the Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines be offered to breastfeeding women, and the discontinuation of breastfeeding was not recommended [ [2](#B2-vaccines-10-00602)]. As the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 recombinant vaccine is not a live-virus vaccine, it is biologically and clinically unlikely to promote a risk to the breastfeeding child. Despite the above collected data, there is still a clear gap in knowledge regarding the possible adverse events on breastfed infants whose mothers have been vaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccines. The current work presents a short report of a 33-year-old breastfeeding mother, vaccinated with the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, who did not reveal clinical, adverse signs or symptoms while her breastfed, 16-month-old female infant had cutaneous adverse reactions (lower extremities and face) two days after the mother's vaccine administration. 2. Case Report [Figure 1](#vaccines-10-00602-f001)(A.1). This episode was reported immediately to the pediatrician, who advised the parents to stay alert and vigilant due to the mother's administration of the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine. After 12 h, the leg lesion fully recovered, and the infant was apyretic. On the third day, two new leg urticarial lesions were observed, one on the back of the right leg [Figure 1](#vaccines-10-00602-f001)(A.2) and the other on the anterior region of the left leg [Figure 1](#vaccines-10-00602-f001)(A.3). After 10 h, both spontaneously disappeared. On the fourth day after the vaccine, a cutaneous rash was observed on the infant's face, with marked uniformly erythematous tender plaques on both the right cheek [Figure 1](#vaccines-10-00602-f001)(B.1) and the left cheek [Figure 1](#vaccines-10-00602-f001)(B.2). After 11 h, both extemporaneously vanished. On the fifth day after the mother's first vaccine administration, red-marked targetoid cutaneous plaques were seen on the left buttock and the left leg [Figure 1](#vaccines-10-00602-f001)(C.1,C.2). These disappeared after 8 h. On the sixth day after the vaccine, the right buttock and right leg showed punctual red lesions that vanished after 12 h [Figure 1](#vaccines-10-00602-f001)(D.1,D.2). Due to the constant spontaneous lesions' improvement and after a telephone discussion with the pediatrician, skin cultures were not advised. The infant only had a fever once. Diarrhea, snot, cough, and oral lesions were not observed. For caution, the infant did not go to kindergarten until full recovery. Apparently, the cutaneous lesions did not cause irritation or itching, and the infant always had an appetite and ate well. The infant was not given any new types of food, and there were no changes to the laundry routines, with the same detergent brands used. Moreover, there were no signs or symptoms of recent or chronic infections, no associations with physical stimuli, and no contacts with inhaled or touched substances. Seven days after the vaccine administration, no further cutaneous lesions were observed, and the pediatrician reported the situation to the competent authorities. During this period, breastfeeding was not interrupted. 3. Discussion [5](#B5-vaccines-10-00602), [6](#B6-vaccines-10-00602)]. A prospective cohort study in pregnant and lactating women from the US found that vaccines were well tolerated, and vaccine reactions in these groups were like those in women who were not pregnant or breastfeeding [ [7](#B7-vaccines-10-00602)]. Antibodies generated in response to the vaccine should protect the breastfeeding women and the breastfed infants [ [7](#B7-vaccines-10-00602)]. [1](#B1-vaccines-10-00602)]. Only two case reports [ [8](#B8-vaccines-10-00602), [9](#B9-vaccines-10-00602)] of delayed cutaneous reactions with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine were found, analogous to the ones manifested by the present infant lesions. All lesions observed in the breastfeeding infant were similar to previous descriptions of cutaneous reactions around the injection site in people who had been vaccinated with other COVID-19 vaccines [ [10](#B10-vaccines-10-00602), [11](#B11-vaccines-10-00602), [12](#B12-vaccines-10-00602), [13](#B13-vaccines-10-00602), [14](#B14-vaccines-10-00602), [15](#B15-vaccines-10-00602)] and born from COVID-19-positive mother [ [16](#B16-vaccines-10-00602)]. The authors state that this is a remarkable fact that deserves attention and discussion among healthcare professionals. Furthermore, those several descriptions and photographs are the main reason as well as triggering point for the presentation of this case report, but it is important to mention that until the present moment, this is the only clinical case report. Within this report, the authors propose an undeniable visual relationship as a significant point between the vaccine administration and the infant's delayed, cutaneous, adverse reactions as there is no other apparent cause for the rash. Due to the cutaneous manifestation's clinical history, it is hypothesized that all may correspond to the following: (i) a delayed, cutaneous, adverse reaction to mother's first-dose vaccine (mainly to the inactive components); (ii) a coincidental event (caused by viral infections, e.g., parvovirus, or other unidentified allergens); (iii) an infant response to the mother's inflammatory reaction to the vaccine; or (iv) a common immune response directed against the spike RNA or proteins inducing virus-associated skin lesions. Since the infant did not develop humoral immunity, it decreases the likelihood that the cutaneous reactions were mediated by the active vaccine contents. Moreover, since the infant did not present a cutaneous reaction with previous vaccines containing polysorbate (e.g., Prevenar 13\u00ae) or other prior medications, authors excluded the polysorbate allergy, considering that polysorbate 80 (PS80), the AstraZeneca vaccine's main component, was potentially allergenic or immunogenic [ [17](#B17-vaccines-10-00602), [18](#B18-vaccines-10-00602), [19](#B19-vaccines-10-00602)].
