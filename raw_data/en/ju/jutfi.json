However, this seasonal restriction creates an ideal pause in the high fat and protein foods of winter and the high sugar and carbohydrate foods of summer. Our digestive capacity is strong during the winter enabling us to enjoy heavier foods like root vegetables, nuts, dairy and some meat. As we transition into spring, however, we can feel sluggish from this diet and as the moisture of spring softens the ground our bodies may start retaining water too. If we continue with a high fat diet this natural increase in fluid can create excess mucus and lethargy rather than promoting a flushing of toxins. We have created the Spring Reset 10 Day Cleanse to help bring you back into balance and set you up for feeling healthy and energised for the summer months ahead. It is a flexible 3 phase programme harnessing the detoxifying and healing benefits of certain foods in simple but tasty recipes. The programme also includes herbal supplements which support the cleanse by improving liver function and boosting digestion.

The liver produces bile, which is stored in the gallbladder and is essential for breaking down fats. When we eat a lot of fatty foods, oils, dairy, refined flours and sugars our digestive power is reduced. Consequently, the gallbladder can become sluggish and bile thickens causing congestion and toxic accumulation. The diet recommended during the Spring Reset suggests restricting foods that contribute to congestion and utilising foods and herbs that naturally scrub and promote clearing processes in our bodies. It is abundant in foods that stimulate the production of bile and its excretion from the gallbladder, speeding up the digestion of proteins and fats. Nature provides us with the perfect partners to support our bodies' cleansing in the form of the bitter greens that start growing in this season. These include spinach, kale, mustard greens, swiss chard, parsley, dandelion, celery, asparagus, watercress, green beans and early salad leaves. The lymphatic system is the body's largest circulatory system and must deal with removing the body's waste products and delivering nutrients. Inflammation and oxidative stress impede lymphatic flow - so foods such as beetroots, red cabbage and red berries which are high in antioxidants are excellent for keeping the lymph moving. Eating plenty of high fibre foods such as lentils also has a scrubbing effect on the intestinal villi which helps keep the intestinal lymphatic system healthy.
