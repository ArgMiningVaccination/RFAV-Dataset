First of all, it depends on the state they are in and whether that state allows them to order labs. Secondly, we can effectively know what is happening in a body, by looking at a symptom picture. When it comes to the example of the hormones you are asking for, there are often symptoms where it is clear what hormone imbalance is present. Other cases might be a little bit more difficult and being able to pinpoint exactly where treatment needs to begin can be achieved by running labs. Sometimes it comes down to patient's preference, as we live in a world where the dominant medical theory provides treatment based on symptoms and lab results. So patients are not comfortable with treating unless they see the imbalance with the numbers on a page with lab results. Hormone testing is crucial if you are planning on doing Hormone Replacement Therapy of any sort. If treating with natural means, a skilled naturopathic doctor can usually effectively treat based on symptom picture. However, you can always request labs to be run if that is what you feel more comfortable with.

General guidelines include not eating large meals in the evening, not eating after 7pm, and avoiding caffeine after 12pm. There is no \"best diet\" answer for everyone, but finding a naturopathic doctor who can help you discover what kind of diet is best for you, as you may have to avoid specific foods in order to find optimal nutritional health.
